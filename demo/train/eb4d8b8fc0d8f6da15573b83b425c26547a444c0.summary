@entity1 , @entity0 -- it is a familiar refrain to hear the earth and its resources being described as precious and that climate change is , and will , prove extremely costly			1
the @entity7 covers 370,000 hectares of the @entity8			0
it is one of the four remaining rainforest regions of the world			0
but historically , no one has attempted to put a market value on nature 's eco-systems and the services they provide			1
last month , a deal was struck between @entity1 - based venture capital company , @entity19 and the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) in @entity22 , @entity23			1
according to @entity19 this is n't a deal about buying up land			1
neither has it anything to do with carbon trading			0
@entity31 , director of the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) and a partner in @entity19 , says the deal is about ; " creating a whole new paradigm for the way in which the world economy values the environment			1
" what @entity19 is saying is that the rainforests provide us with a service that benefits us all			1
not only do rainforests naturally store carbon , they also provide the means for economic stability for the indigenous population , the surrounding regions and further afield			2
like everything else , these natural services should and will , they hope , have a value			2
hrh the @entity54 , who is a patron of the @entity21 , has described the rainforests as : " giant global utilities providing an essential service to humanity on a vast scale			1
" he thinks that the value of the world 's forests is not properly understood and therefore not paid for			2
seen from this perspective , @entity19 's new investors might be on to a good thing			1
founded in 1996 , the @entity21 has historically been devoted to scientific research , pioneering the sustainable use of rainforests , as well as encouraging eco-tourism			2
the intention now is to create a new commercial business model marketing its assets which will preserve its long term future			0
the prize asset is the 370,000 hectares of the @entity7 , which lies in the heart of the @entity8 -- a vast area of tropical forest which stretches over 2.5 million square kilometers across the north - east of @entity23 , crossing six state borders			0
it was gifted to the @entity80 for the purposes of research in 1989			0
@entity19 , who announced the deal at the world 's first ' @entity85 ' in @entity87 , currently has a dozen investors who collectively hold an 80 percent stake in the company			1
the remaining 20 percent is held by the @entity33			0
an alliance of 29 scientific institutions conducting research into forest canopy , the @entity33 has been evolving the concept of canopy eco-system services for the past eight years			2
discussion started within the scientific community , then moved on to involve environmental economists			0
the final step was to approach the financial community to see if there was a market for eco-services			2
it was here that the idea took off			0
@entity33 director @entity31 met up with @entity108 -- a former investment banker			0
@entity108 shared @entity31 's passion for rainforest conservation and set about trying to work out whether such a project would be economically viable			2
before setting up @entity19 together , they worked on the @entity114 -- a project in @entity117 's largest state to preserve the rainforests and their inhabitants			1
@entity31 , who combines his work at @entity19 and the @entity33 with research at @entity123 's @entity122 , has been studying tropical forests -- in particular their canopy -- for 35 years			1
he believes that the new concept can capitalize on the growing fear in the financial markets that climate change is going to be far more costly in the future if we do n't act now			1
" markets are driven by fear and greed , " he told @entity2 , " and the fear factor has become greater and greater as the science gets better and better			2
" he says that the rainforests are a global utility and should be treated as such			1
" it 's like a local power station			2
we do n't really know how it works , but we all enjoy the electricity when we turn the lights on			0
but if you do n't pay the bill you get cut off , " he said			0
it might be easy to measure the output from a power station , but how do you define and measure the benefits of a rainforest ? one way , @entity31 says , is to model what would happen if the remaining big rainforests utilities -- @entity8 , @entity157 , the @entity158 and @entity159 -- were n't there			1
" one of the scenarios produced by @entity162 of @entity163 shows that if you remove the @entity157 , you see rainfall reductions in @entity167 at different times of the year			1
if you remove them from the @entity158 you see changes in rainfall reductions in @entity172 and parts of @entity174			1
this would affect our ability to provide food			2
reduced @entity157 rainfall could also have devastating effects closer to home			1
@entity117 is a nation highly dependent on hydro - power for electricity generation			0
in 2004 , over 83 percent came from hydro - power			0
for them , less rain would literally mean less power			0
the destruction of rainforests pose a threat to energy and food security over a vast area , affecting millions of lives			2
" governments have a role to play , " said @entity31 , " but so do markets			1
" @entity19 is currently producing an audit of the @entity199 rainforest			1
@entity31 estimates that the @entity7 could be storing up to around 80 million tons of @entity200 , but he says it 's difficult to work out exact values for rainforests right now			1
there are threats to the @entity7 -- a road running through the @entity7 is due to be widened -- but @entity31 thinks that overall , the dangers are relatively low			0
and with the president of @entity22 , @entity209 , committed to the idea of the international community intervening in forest life , in return for environmental protection and aid , the prospects for @entity19 so far look good			1
" we 're going to have to invest in the earth 's life support systems , " @entity31 said			0
" what 's the point of making a machine to capture carbon out of the atmosphere when rainforests do it for free ? it 's cheaper to maintain that than to build a new one			1
" but @entity227 , director of the @entity229 charity @entity228 sounded a note of caution about the proposal			0
" we 're fairly skeptical about these ideas of trading in eco-system services or in the carbon that is stored in rainforests as an effective way of protecting them , " he told @entity2			2
" what we have found over the years is that the only effective way to protect the long term future of rainforests is to ensure that the people who live in and around the forest get some benefit in it staying			0
and it 's not clear how the local people are going to benefit , " @entity227 said			0
@entity227 pointed out that traditional carbon trading benefits tend to accrue to the traders , the middle - men , the investors and speculators			0
" the hope is that there will be markets for these vaguely defined eco-services			0
whether this is going to be the case with the @entity262 project we just do n't know yet , because there are no details of who is going to get what from it			0

new deal attempts to put a market value on nature 's eco-systems and its services
rainforests viewed as giant global utilities providing service to humanity
reductions in @entity157 rainfall could affect the @entity284 *mid-west*
@entity19 argue markets and governments must play a role in climate change
