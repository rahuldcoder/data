-- the man tasked with investigating the @entity3 bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments resigned wednesday , plunging world football into turmoil			0
@entity8 's resignation followed world governing body @entity12 's decision to throw out his appeal after he complained about the way his report into the bidding process had been summarized by @entity18 judge @entity17 -- @entity12 's independent ethics adjudicator			1
" i disagree with the @entity26 's decision , " said the @entity21 lawyer @entity8 -- the chairman of the @entity22 of the @entity23 -- in a public statement			1
" it now appears that , at least for the foreseeable future , the @entity28 will stand as the final word on the 2018 and @entity32 bidding process			0
" no independent governance committee , investigator , or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organization			1
" @entity12 president @entity38 said he was surprised by @entity8 's resignation but that the " work of the @entity23 will nonetheless continue			1
" " pending the election of a new chairman of the @entity23 by the @entity47 , the @entity44 will appoint an acting chairman to serve as a replacement for mr @entity8 , " added @entity38 , who will be at @entity42 's meeting in @entity43 on thursday and friday			1
however @entity50 , who is standing against @entity38 in the 2015 @entity12 presidential election , said @entity8 's decision was " a step backwards			1
" " we need to know what happened before and after the 2 december 2010 vote , " added @entity50 , referring to the date @entity55 and @entity56 won the right to stage the 2018 and 2022 @entity58			0
" when will the facts be known fully , transparently and above all without suspicion ? when will we be able to start rebuilding @entity12 's image ? and we need to protect the @entity3			2
" @entity8 said his decision to resign had also been in influenced by @entity12 's " lack of leadership			1
" " now even @entity12 's very own lead investigator has recognized what many of us have warned for months : its self investigation process is neither valid nor credible , " said @entity21 lawyer @entity67 , who has been a campaigner for greater accountability from @entity12			1
it has been a difficult few months for @entity8			2
in september the @entity21 said for the first time that his report should be made public with redactions			2
@entity12 rejected his request on the grounds that witness confidentiality for his work could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published			2
then @entity17 published his summary , prompting @entity8 to respond by saying the @entity18 judge 's 42 - page report contained " numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations			2
" in his resignation statement @entity8 went even further			2
" a brief i filed with the @entity88 on november 24 , 2014 , outlined the @entity28 's most serious failings , " said the @entity21 lawyer			1
" among other points , the brief explained why , when viewed in the context of the report it purported to summarize , no principled approach could justify the @entity28 's edits , omissions , and additions			0
" after @entity17 's summary was published , @entity8 also faced pressure from two whistle - blowers			0
@entity102 and @entity104 @entity103 gave evidence to @entity8 and claim he broke his promise over an offer of anonymity if they helped with his investigative report			0
the two women insist that assurances were given to them both in private and public that they would not be compromised after agreeing to give evidence " through a sense of natural justice and a desire to bring closure to a long running chapter in our lives			0
" the women were not identified by name , but they contend they were " clearly identifiable " in the summary of @entity8 's report			0
however , @entity12 's disciplinary committee said tuesday there " were no grounds to justify the opening of disciplinary proceedings " given " the breach of confidentiality claim had no substance			0
" responding to @entity8 's resignation , @entity103 welcomed his decision , given he " agrees with what many of us have long stated -- that @entity12 is incapable of reform or cultural change with its current leadership			1
" @entity141 described the @entity21 's departure from @entity12 was " one more , emphatic exposure of @entity12 's self - protecting corruption			1
" she added : " @entity12 has no ethics			0
its rules are a farce			0
not even an extensive , purportedly independent , two year investigation and report could affect its culture			1
" why would anyone believe or trust anything it says ? "			0
