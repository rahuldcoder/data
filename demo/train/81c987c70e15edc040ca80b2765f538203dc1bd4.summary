-- @entity1 , who has moved back and forth between public service and journalism like few others in either profession , is doing it again			1
this time he 's leaving @entity7 , where he has been a senior correspondent for two years , and joining the @entity8			1
@entity1 announced his latest move on thursday			0
he embodies something that is , for some media critics , a source of great concern : the so - called " revolving door " between the people who cover the news and the people who are being covered			1
for @entity7 , he 's something else : a fount of great knowledge who will be almost impossible to replace			0
@entity21 , the president of the network news division , said @entity1 's decision was " a loss for @entity7			1
" " he 's been really great for us , " @entity21 said in a telephone interview on thursday			0
@entity7 allowed @entity1 out of his contract with the network because , as @entity21 put it , " it would just be inappropriate to stand in the way " of a return to public service			1
@entity1 's exact title at the @entity8 is not yet known			2
but he 'll have a high - profile job in counterterrorism , reuniting with his former boss @entity36 , who was the commissioner of the police department in the mid- 1990s and will return to that position in january			0
@entity1 worked for local television stations in @entity40 before going to work for @entity36 as a spokesman for the @entity8 in 1994			2
he subsequently worked for @entity43 ; the @entity44 , again under @entity36 , who had become police chief there ; the @entity47 ; and the office of the director of national intelligence			0
in late 2011 he joined @entity7 as a senior correspondent			0
when asked at the time about @entity1 's moves back and forth between journalism and law enforcement , @entity21 said , " he understands journalistic sources and methods and he understands our values			1
" on thursday , @entity21 said of the revolving - door situation and @entity1 , " he 's traveled through it a number of times , " and added " we do n't think it 's a bad thing			1
" @entity21 praised @entity1 for having an unmatched rolodex of sources and said @entity7 has " benefited from that greatly			2
" among the stories @entity21 cited were the mass shootings in @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 , @entity73 , when @entity1 was frequently on television to share information he had obtained from law enforcement sources			1
@entity21 added , " @entity1 was the reason why we did n't go with the erroneous reports of an arrest in the @entity82 bombings			0
" ( a number of other news organizations , including @entity0 , prematurely reported an arrest had been made two days after the april explosions			0
) " there 's nobody like him , and i think people around the television industry would agree with that , " @entity21 said			0
" they all would have liked to have him on those , and many more stories that he 's done for us			0
" @entity1 's close relationships with law enforcement sources , however , are among the reasons why some media critics have objected to his role at @entity7 and his repeated transitions from public service to journalism			1
they say the revolving door creates conflicts of interest for @entity1 and reporters like him			1
@entity1 's " @entity112 " report about the @entity111 met with disapproval by media critics earlier this month in part because of his pending move to the @entity8			1
( @entity117 of @entity118 said on @entity0 's " @entity119 , " " @entity1 has left journalism twice before			2
" @entity117 listed @entity1 's prior jobs and said that in the " 60 minutes " report , " he disclosed only one of those for law enforcement roles			1
" ) @entity21 indicated that he did n't think the report on the @entity111 was a conflict of interest			0
he said on thursday , " if he ( @entity1 ) was covering the @entity8 , that would have been inappropriate			2
" @entity1 's move was announced via a news report on @entity132 , the @entity7 affiliate in @entity40			2
in an interview , @entity1 alluded to the fact that he 'll be involved in the city 's counterterrorism efforts , saying of @entity40 , " they have certainly the biggest , most complex and forward - leaning counterterrorism operation of any police department in the world , so it will be a great challenge that i hope to rise to			0
" @entity21 said @entity7 would seek to replace @entity1 soon , possibly through a combination of new hires			2
" if and when he decides to return to journalism , we 'd welcome him back , " he said .			0

@entity1 is leaving @entity7 to join the @entity8
his *career* has included stints in both journalism and law enforcement
some media critics call such back - and - forth *changing* a " revolving door "
they say the revolving door creates conflicts of interest for those in it
