@entity0 -- @entity3 prosecutors have appealed @entity5 ' verdict and sentence , hoping to convict him of a more serious charge or make him serve more time in the 2013 shooting death of his girlfriend			1
the appeal paperwork has been filed , @entity11 spokesman @entity10 said tuesday			0
a judge sentenced @entity5 to five years in prison on october 21 after finding the double - amputee track star guilty of culpable homicide , or negligent killing , in the death of @entity19			1
prosecutors originally took @entity5 to trial on a murder charge			2
in the appeal documents , the prosecution calls @entity5 ' sentence " shockingly light " and inappropriate			1
a court hearing will be held on the matter , but no date has been set			0
the process could take six months , @entity1 legal analyst @entity29 said			1
@entity5 acknowledged shooting @entity19 in february 2013			2
prosecutors said he wanted to kill her ; @entity5 said he mistook her for an intruder and her killing was a tragic accident			2
prosecutors are arguing that judge @entity37 misinterpreted a complex @entity3 standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case , according to @entity29			0
as a result , prosecutors argue , he should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge			1
in explaining her sentence , @entity37 concluded that @entity5 did not intend to kill @entity19			1
but critics of the verdict have argued that @entity37 did n't correctly apply the intent standard , which is broader in @entity3 law than what it typically means in casual conversation , @entity29 said			2
in their appeal of the sentence , prosecutors would have to prove the five years given by @entity37 is inappropriate in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases , according to @entity29			1
prosecutor @entity59 called for a minimum sentence of 10 years			0
if an appeals court finds that the sentence is inappropriate , the court could set it aside and issue a new one			0
but appeals courts in @entity3 are reluctant to get involved in sentencing decisions , @entity29 said			0
under @entity3 law , @entity5 will have to serve at least one - sixth of his sentence before asking to be placed under correctional supervision			1
correctional supervision usually means house arrest			0
@entity1 's @entity71 reported from @entity0			0
