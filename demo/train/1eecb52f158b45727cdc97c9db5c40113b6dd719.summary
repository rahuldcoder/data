-- secretary of state @entity1 will finally take questions from members of @entity4 on wednesday about the deadly terror attack on the @entity7 diplomatic mission in @entity8 , @entity9			1
lawmakers have long wanted @entity12 's full accounting of the september 11 assault that killed ambassador @entity14 and three other @entity7			1
they also want to ask her about diplomatic security , which the @entity17 has since re-examined at posts located in overseas hot spots			0
agency officials have acknowledged shortcomings and promised changes			0
some of the toughest questions before the @entity24 and the @entity25 are expected to focus on the @entity28 administration 's slow - to - evolve public explanation of the attack , which triggered an uproar in the middle of a presidential election campaign			1
@entity34 ambassador @entity33 took most of the political heat as mainly @entity37 lawmakers seized on her public comments the administration has said were based on fast - moving intelligence that later proved to be incorrect			1
still , some @entity37 suggested the administration sought to mute the true nature of the attack to prevent president @entity28 's political opponents from fully exploiting it in the final weeks of the november campaign			1
the issue was so polarizing that @entity12 's decision to postpone an initial appearance before @entity4 in december due to health problems was questioned by her harshest critics as a possible dodge			1
it was revealed that she had a virus and suffered a concussion			0
@entity12 was then hospitalized for a blood clot , only returning to work two weeks ago			2
@entity12 's future health ' as good as her past ' her testimony will be public and will likely be the most difficult moment of her final days as @entity7 's top diplomat			1
despite the controversy , @entity12 's poll numbers remain high			1
she 's leaving the job soon			2
some of the potential questions she will face : what did @entity12 know ? @entity37 sen. @entity72 wants a full explanation of @entity12 's understanding of the attack -- what happened before , during and after			1
the 2008 @entity37 presidential nominee and the top @entity37 member of the @entity79 , @entity72 told @entity0 this week that he feels " the @entity7 people were clearly deceived			0
" @entity72 told reporters eight days after the attack that he had information the @entity17 had been warned			2
in mid november , @entity72 took to the floor of the @entity25 and accused @entity28 of lying about the attack			1
" the @entity7 people have received nothing but contradictory statements from all levels of our government , " he said			0
the @entity91 released an official timeline that highlighted when defense secretary @entity93 and his senior commanders were first informed and when follow up decisions were made involving the military			0
the timeline shows @entity93 and joint chiefs chairman gen. @entity97 were told of the attack about an hour after it started			0
both were on their way to the @entity101 for an already scheduled meeting with the president			2
thirty minutes later , @entity28 was directing the @entity91 to do all it could to help , according to senior @entity91 officials			0
@entity28 administration continues explanations of attack what does @entity12 know about cables warning of security threats ? just hours before the attack , @entity14 sent a message to the @entity17 that referred to a meeting nine days earlier during which the commander of @entity8 's @entity120 " expressed growing frustration with police and security forces " about security capabilities			1
that cable , since made public , is part of more than 160 pages of documents that paint a picture of persistent and unpredictable violence in and around @entity8 last year			2
it also reveals that the @entity7 contingent in @entity8 felt it needed more security			2
in february , the regional security officer in @entity131 , @entity132 , warned that having just two diplomatic security agents on the ground in @entity8 made movements outside the @entity7 facility impossible			2
" i 've been placed in a difficult spot when the ambassador tells me i need to support @entity8 , " @entity132 wrote in a february 12 e-mail to the regional director of the @entity139 at the @entity17			2
@entity12 's @entity8 statement was @entity12 informed about the rise of @entity145 - linked militants ? in the september 11 cable , a paragraph refers to the " expanding @entity149 influence in @entity150 , " a town east of @entity8 , amid reports linking " the @entity153 with a troubling increase in violence and @entity149 influence			1
" the @entity153 was prominent among the opponents of former strongman @entity158			0
the ambassador refers to another meeting on september 9 in which commanders of unofficial militia claimed that the @entity163 depended on them to secure eastern @entity9 , and even supplied them with weapons			0
read more about @entity14 ' warnings about militants communication from the ground up likely will be examined during @entity12 's testimony			1
' talking points ' cited by @entity172 and why did n't @entity12 give that public explanation ? @entity172 spoke for the @entity28 administration on sunday talk shows on september 16			1
she made several claims that turned out to be wrong			0
the primary complaint from @entity37 is that @entity172 's remarks were centered on anger over the anti-islam film , " @entity181 , " when there was classified intelligence available suggesting a possible @entity145 link			0
on the talk shows , @entity172 spoke from unclassified talking points officials said were provided by the intelligence community			1
she said the armed assault was spontaneous and linked to regional outrage over the film			0
since then , @entity172 has twice talked to lawmakers about her remarks			0
in a statement , @entity172 said her talking points were " incorrect in a key respect : there was no protest or demonstration in @entity8			1
" " while we certainly wish that we had had perfect information just days after the terrorist attack , as is often the case , " the statement said			0
" the intelligence assessment has evolved			0
" @entity28 defended @entity172 publicly , but she later withdrew her name from consideration as his likely nominee to replace @entity12 at the @entity17			2
why has only one attack suspect been detained , and then released ? @entity213 was freed earlier this month by a @entity215 judge overseeing the case against him , the country 's state news agency reported			1
he was arrested in @entity217 in connection with the @entity8 attack			1
on january 9 , @entity17 spokeswoman @entity220 referred questions to the @entity222 , which she said " has the lead on the @entity8 investigation			2
" the @entity215 news agency , @entity225 , reported that @entity213 had been questioned by @entity215 authorities and the @entity222 " as a witness and not a suspect			0
" but a @entity7 federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the probe said he remains a suspect			0
the fact that @entity213 has been freed from detention " does n't mean he 's any less a suspect , " the official said , adding @entity213 does not appear on video taken of the @entity8 compound			1
investigators have identified at least 15 people who may be suspects , the official told @entity0 , indicating some were identified on the video			0
" we will get indictments , " the official said			0
" but it 's not possible to put a timetable on it			0
" reports on the attack in december , an independent review of the @entity8 assault cited " systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies " at the @entity17			1
four @entity17 officials , including two who oversaw security decisions for @entity8 , were disciplined a day after the report was released			1
@entity12 got a copy of the report and said in letters to @entity17 chiefs that she accepted its recommendations to beef up security and intelligence gathering in high - threat areas			1
before the report came out , @entity12 had popular approval ratings in nationwide polls			2
a december @entity272 showed 70 percent of @entity7 had a mostly favorable view of her			0
polls from @entity280 / @entity279 , @entity276 / @entity275 and the @entity277 also showed high marks			0
confusion , contradictions in hunt for @entity8 suspects			2

@entity25 , @entity101 to question @entity1 on wednesday about @entity8 attack
did she know about growing militant *danger* ; did she see cables *explaining* threat ?
why has only one suspect been detained , and then released ?
where did @entity33 's now *infamous* ' talking points ' originate ; why did n't @entity12 give them ?
