@entity0 -- a new national poll in the battle for the 2016 @entity5 and @entity6 presidential nominations indicates what you would expect : @entity9 is the overwhelming @entity5 frontrunner , and there 's no real leader among the possible @entity6 @entity13 hopefuls			1
but if you get beyond the obvious , the @entity1 / @entity15 survey released monday becomes more revealing			0
it showed 65 % of @entity5 and independents who lean toward that party say they would likely back @entity20 as their presidential nominee			2
vice president @entity22 comes in a distant second , at 10 % , with freshman sen. @entity24 of @entity25 at 7 % , @entity27 gov. @entity26 at 6 % , and @entity29 gov. @entity28 at 2 %			2
the @entity1 survey is in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated @entity20 , who has not said whether she 'll run , is far ahead of all the other possible @entity5 candidates			0
@entity9 : @entity37 weapons handover would be ' important step ' even though the next race for the @entity13 is a long way away , there 's already intense speculation over whether the former secretary of state will make a second bid for president			2
as with previous surveys this year , the new @entity1 poll also indicates no @entity6 frontrunner			1
seventeen percent of @entity6 and @entity49 who lean toward the @entity6 say they are likely to support @entity51 gov. @entity50 , with 16 % backing rep. @entity52 of @entity53 , the @entity54 chairman and 2012 @entity6 vice presidential nominee			1
sen. @entity56 of @entity57 is at 13 % ; former @entity59 gov. @entity58 at 10 % ; sen. @entity60 of @entity59 at 9 % ; sen. @entity61 of @entity62 at 7 % , and former sen. @entity63 of @entity64 , a 2012 @entity6 presidential candidate who battled eventual nominee @entity65 deep into the primary season , at 5 %			1
opinion : a reversal for @entity6 and @entity5 @entity60 's number stands out			1
the first - term senator , considered a rock star among many @entity6 , registered in the upper teens in polls of the possible @entity6 2016 horserace conducted by other organizations earlier this year			1
but @entity60 's support of immigration reform -- he was a high profile member of a bipartisan group of senators who pushed immigration reform passage through the @entity82 this spring -- may have hurt his standing with many conservative voters opposed to such efforts			1
@entity63 's 5 % is also interesting			0
" it 's often said -- and it 's usually true -- that polls taken years before the first presidential primaries are mostly tests of name recognition			0
but clearly ( it 's ) something more than name recognition when it comes to @entity63 , " says @entity1 polling director @entity92			0
" @entity63 is well - known to @entity6 voters -- he had months of national exposure in the 2012 primaries , and since the start of the modern primary system in the 1970s , the @entity6 has tended to nominate the candidate who was the runner - up the last time the party had an open race for the nomination			1
but @entity63 is not just in the middle of the pack -- he is currently running dead last out of the eight candidates tested , " adds @entity92			0
@entity63 : the @entity109 has no national security interest in @entity37 @entity50 may be on top of the list , but he 's not first in the minds of conservatives , who dominate more moderate republicans in the @entity6 primaries and caucuses			2
according to the poll , only 8 % of republicans who consider themselves conservatives say they would be likely to back @entity50 , compared to 28 % of self - described moderate @entity6			1
in the potential @entity5 battle , the survey indicates @entity20 performing better with women ( 76 % ) than men ( 52 % )			0
and @entity22 scores higher with voters age 50 and older ( 18 % ) than those younger than 50 ( 5 % )			0
@entity22 : @entity13 @entity6 ' @entity127 ' with the start of the primary and caucus calendar more than two years off , take this survey and others with a grain of salt			2
" polls taken two to three years before an election have absolutely no predictive value , " adds @entity92			0
" do not treat this as a prediction of what will happen in 2016			0
" @entity22 courts presidential speculation with @entity143 trip the @entity1 poll was conducted by @entity15 september 6 - 8 , with 1,022 adult @entity109 questioned by telephone			1
the survey 's overall sampling error for @entity5 and @entity6 primary questions is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points			0
the sample included 218 respondents who describe themselves as @entity6 and 234 who describe themselves as independents who lean towards @entity6 , for a total of 452 republicans , and 311 respondents who describe themselves as @entity5 and 137 who describe themselves as independents who lean @entity5 , for a total of 448 @entity5 .			2

@entity22 distant second to @entity9 in a new poll on 2016 presidential *nod*
the poll also indicates no frontrunner for the 2016 @entity6 nomination at this point
seventeen percent of @entity6 and @entity6 - leaning independents likely to support @entity50
but the poll also indicates *problems* for @entity50 with conservative @entity6 ; @entity60 number drops
