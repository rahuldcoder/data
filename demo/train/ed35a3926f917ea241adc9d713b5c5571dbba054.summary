-- the @entity1 reinforced its close ties with @entity3 this week by increasing aid to the @entity5 by 48 percent			1
@entity6 spoke with dr. @entity7 , chief of the @entity8 , about @entity3 's relationship with the @entity1 @entity10 says the increase in aid to $ 663 million this year shows " the bipartisan support in @entity1 for the difficult choices @entity3 has made in its homegrown reform efforts			1
" @entity3 has been a close political ally of the @entity1 for decades			1
the strength of their relationship was recognised in 2000 when @entity3 became the first @entity20 country to sign a free trade deal with the @entity1 when @entity3 's @entity22 came to power in 1999 , he put economic reform at the top of his agenda			1
since then , the @entity5 has moved to liberalize trade , eliminate fuel subsidies , crack down on corruption and reform the tax system			0
dr. @entity7 is a former economic advisor to the prime minister of jordan			2
he 's now chief of the @entity8 , and vice chairman of the @entity35			2
@entity36 spoke with @entity37 and asked him whether the increase in @entity1 aid to @entity3 is recognition of the role that @entity3 's been playing in the @entity42 , both economically and politically			1
@entity37 ( @entity43 ) : there is a definite recognition of what @entity3 has been doing over the last two years			1
particularly the efforts that have been conducted by @entity48 over the last two years in helping to bring the peace process on track again			0
but equally , there is recognition in @entity10 , as elsewhere in the world , of the reforms that are taking place in @entity3			0
( recognition ) of what we are trying to do with fiscal management , enabling the investment environment to become much better , and to attract private capital to come in and invest in key sectors of our economy			0
as a result of this , we have witnessed an increase in the assistance levels from the @entity1 and we hope that this will continue over the next couple of years			0
( @entity70 ) : one could say that @entity1 relations in the @entity42 specifically in the @entity73 are at a historic low			1
does this one - week tour by president @entity76 really alter the outlook between @entity1 and @entity42 relations ? ( @entity43 ) : to the extent that the @entity20 countries and the @entity20 people feel that the @entity1 is committed to play an honest broker and bring about a just and lasting solution to the @entity85 issue , which we feel to be the core issue in the @entity20 @entity89 conflict			2
to the extent that we see a deliverable on the ground , which means a real improvement in the lives of @entity85 and a real commitment to the peace process			0
i think you will have a substantial increase in the credibility that the @entity1 commands on the @entity101			0
this is the major factor in our opinion that really provides for the @entity1 image to be improved in the @entity20 countries			2
( @entity70 ) : it was a historic week if you look at the big picture : an arms and missile deal worth $ 20 billion with @entity112 ; and at the same time , @entity73 investment funds investing in @entity114 and @entity115			0
do you think eventually this will lead to investment protectionism where there 's resistance to this money coming from the @entity73 and into @entity1 and @entity123 markets ? ( @entity43 ) : i think you 're going to see a real financial power in the @entity73 countries			1
obviously , they will be able to afford to develop their economies more			0
i think they are going to feel that the regional threats are of such magnitude that they would be required to arm themselves more , and this explains why there have been big contracts , not only with the @entity1 , but other countries as well in @entity123			2
you are going to have some kind of recycling going on which is clearly manifested in the @entity114 and @entity115 investments by @entity143			0
we do hope that these big funds in the @entity73 will find some attractive opportunities in the @entity147 as well -- in @entity3 , in other countries which do require this huge capital investments to improve the infrastructure and to be invested in key sectors of our economies			1
