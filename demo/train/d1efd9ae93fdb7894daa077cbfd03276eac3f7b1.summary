@entity1 's reality show " @entity2 " has tons of fans , but more than 80,000 ca n't be counted in that number			1
that 's the amount who have signed a @entity9 petition to have the show canceled in light of what the petition calls the @entity16 's @entity15 stance			2
according to the petition , @entity2 's voice can be heard on a recorded call from this past summer urging the citizens of @entity20 , @entity21 , to vote to repeal a law that forbids business owners and landlords from evicting and firing people based on gender identity			1
" the @entity27 is voting on an ordinance this tuesday night that would allow men -- yes i said men -- to use women 's and girls ' restrooms , locker rooms , showers , sleeping areas and other areas that are designated for females only , " the petition reports @entity32 as saying on the robocall			2
" i do n't believe the citizens of @entity20 would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls			0
" the petition says @entity32 's words " reek of ignorance and fear mongering			2
" " just because someone is transgendered does n't mean they are a child predator or a rapist , " the petition says			0
" the claim that this ordinance would provide predators with access to women 's restrooms in order to assault or leer at girls or women is nothing more than fear - mongering and spreading ignorance and hatred			0
" the @entity2 are known for being devout @entity71 who do n't believe in practicing birth control and whose children follow courtship rules that include no kissing until their wedding day			1
the petition also says that the @entity2 ' oldest son , @entity78 , has taken a job with the @entity80 , which the petition says " is such a hate - filled , anti-gay organization that the @entity83 in 2010 labeled it a ' hate group ' for its ' dissemination of false and demonizing propaganda about gays and lesbians			1
' " the movement comes on the heels of controversy about a recent posting on the @entity2 ' " official " facebook page			0
after their newly married daughter @entity96 was criticized for sharing an @entity99 photo of herself kissing her husband @entity94 , @entity2 and @entity32 posted an image of themselves kissing and challenging others to do the same			0
@entity103 , who blogs about @entity105 issues at @entity106 , wrote that pictures of same - sex couples were deleted			0
a counter petition to support the @entity2 has been started and as of friday had more than 6,000 signatures .			1

as of *thursday* the petition had more than 80,000 signatures
the @entity2 are known as devout @entity71
