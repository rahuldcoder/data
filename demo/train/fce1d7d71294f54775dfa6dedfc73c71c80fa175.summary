-- the midterm elections are around the corner			2
the big question will obviously be what happens to control of the @entity6 and @entity7			0
but control of @entity9 is only one part of the equation			1
there are a series of issues that will shape the individual races that will tell us a lot about which way @entity19 politics is heading			2
can mainstream @entity20 take the party back ? there are a number of @entity6 and @entity7 primaries where @entity20 , organized through business - backed organizations , are trying to seize back control of their party			1
former @entity29 rep. @entity28 and the @entity30 , a group with strong backing from the corporate world , are trying to counteract the power of the tea party , which they believe is damaging the standing of the @entity20			1
" we want our party back , " @entity28 explained to the @entity37			2
in the @entity40 of @entity41 , rep. @entity39 is facing a strong challenge in the may primaries from @entity44 , a tea party @entity20 who has received support from the @entity48			1
@entity44 is challenging the eight - term incumbent by depicting him as an embodiment of @entity52 republicans who refuse to stand firm for real budget cuts , a legislator who agreed to reopen the federal government even without what conservatives would consider a good budget deal			0
the @entity30 has been fighting back			0
the most visible battle between a mainstream @entity20 and tea party @entity20 is taking place in @entity63 , where @entity7 minority leader @entity64 is facing a challenge from @entity66 in the primary			1
in @entity69 , the controversial right - wing rep. @entity68 is running against sen. @entity70			0
can @entity71 take advantage of @entity20 problems ? despite the fallout from the rollout of the @entity77 , democrats are hoping that they can take advantage of the turmoil facing the @entity20 over the recent year , as the party 's approval ratings have plummeted in light of the budget battles and the public 's unhappiness with the party 's growing extremism			1
there are certain must - wins for @entity71 if they are to show that they are capable of taking advantage of this moment			0
in @entity96 's 13th district , @entity93 , a well - known and well - respected @entity94 , is attempting to win the seat of long - term @entity20 veteran @entity98 , who recently died , leaving open this highly competitive district			1
if @entity71 ca n't win this special election on march 11 , it will signal trouble			0
@entity71 will also be looking for a win in @entity96 's @entity40 , where @entity104 is trying to defeat rep. @entity105 in a test of whether the @entity107 has really softened as conservative territory			0
the @entity109 has been pouring resources into the district to paint @entity105 as a poster child for the @entity6 @entity20			2
" congressman @entity105 's reckless plan to repeal the entire @entity77 would mean 614,200 consumers in @entity96 would be left without health insurance rebates , " said one party spokesperson			1
what effect will the politics of immigration have ? after the 2012 election , many experts predicted that the immigrant vote would continue to flow toward the @entity71 while @entity20 will pay the electoral price for their obstruction			1
now we 'll find out if that 's correct			0
in @entity135 's 6th district , @entity20 @entity127 , a former opponent of immigration reform who changed his tune after redistricting brought an infusion of @entity132 into his constituency , is struggling to hold on to his seat			1
@entity71 are hoping that the sizable @entity138 population in suburban @entity139 will demonstrate their opposition to what the @entity6 @entity20 have been doing by blocking legislation that would offer a path to citizenship			2
which is the more politically potent issue -- opposing @entity77 or supporting the minimum wage ? both parties are putting forth national issues for candidates to run with in their districts and states			1
@entity71 are honing in on the issue of economic inequality , stressing their campaign to raise the minimum wage from $ 7.25 to over $ 10 by 2015			1
for @entity71 , the risk is alienating democrats from centrist constituencies who believe this will damage the economy			0
but they hope that the strong support in polls for the minimum wage boosts their candidates			1
rep. @entity166 , chair of the @entity109 , predicts that there are at least 12 seats where labor - based campaigns to raise the minimum wage will help @entity71			1
" the refusal to increase the minimum wage is just one of the ways @entity6 @entity20 have inflicted harm on the economy and hurt people 's pocketbooks , " @entity166 said			1
for @entity20 , the risk is they will be perceived as a party that is stuck in the mud , at a time that millions of @entity19 are starting to finally see benefits from the @entity77 rather than simply see the program as something abstract that threatens their families			1
in @entity188 , republicans are counting on sen. @entity190 's support for the @entity77 as a useful target for rep. @entity192 to unseat this incumbent			2
republicans will do the same in @entity196 , where sen. @entity197 has a record of statements in support of the health care program			0
how much money should we spend on elections -- and where should it come from ? this is the question now asked of every congressional and presidential election , but it is one we need to continue asking			2
on both sides -- the @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity48 , and @entity212 on the right and @entity214 and @entity215 on the left -- independent organizations are ready to roll in an unprecedented effort			0
with each election we have been seeing the cost of campaigning rise and the need for candidates to court donors as more and more urgent			0
the @entity7 race will probably be the most expensive ever			0
all of this fuels the power of private money in our political system , undermining trust in government and supporting gridlock			0
when the results become clear in november , we will know a lot more about the general tenor of the @entity19 electorate			0
politicians in both parties will have a better read of the kind of electorate they will be facing as they move into the 2016 presidential election			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			2

as 2014 elections loom , there are questions beyond which party controls @entity9
@entity245 asks whether mainstream @entity20 can overcome @entity250 direction
he says which argument is stronger : against @entity77 , or for minimum wage hike ?
@entity245 : what impact will the politics of immigration reform have on the result ?
