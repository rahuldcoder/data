first , the bad news : even if the economy improves , middle - class career paths will continue to disappear as globalization and technological innovation render more jobs obsolete			1
now , the good news : the fear , stress and humiliation caused by unemployment ( and underemployment ) can be alleviated with a simple solution			2
and now , the even - better news : this simple solution is starting to find backers on both sides of the political spectrum			0
a monthly cash payment to every @entity19 , no questions asked , would solve several of our most daunting challenges			1
it 's called a basic income , and it 's cheaper and much more effective than our current malfunctioning safety net , which costs nearly $ 1 trillion per year			1
the idea of a basic income , sometimes called a guaranteed minimum income or a negative income tax , has been discussed for decades by notable economists like @entity31			1
in the late 1960s and 1970s , the idea had bipartisan backing before losing steam			0
recently , in the face of a sputtering economy , a weak job market and rising income inequality , it has been gathering supporters at an ever - quickening pace			1
in fact , just last month , former @entity19 labor secretary @entity42 called a basic income guarantee " almost inevitable			1
" the concept of a basic income is not entirely abstract			2
several countries , such as @entity48 , have achieved notable success with their programs , lifting many people out of poverty			0
in countries like @entity55 , nongovernmental organizations are experimenting with pilot programs in specific areas , with promising results so far			0
the @entity19 is already experimenting with a variation of basic income , even though most people do n't realize it			1
@entity63 has a small version , called a @entity65 , which is incredibly popular and made the state one of the most economically equal places in @entity19			1
importantly , @entity63 do n't consider it " redistribution , " but rather " joint ownership			0
" the benefits of a basic income on a national scale would be wide - ranging			2
first , there 's the lift to the overall economy if everyone has money to spend			1
next , there are the obvious psychological benefits of knowing you can always afford food and shelter			2
then there 's the societal stability factor : if people 's basic economic needs are being met — no matter what the unpredictable job market is doing — we do n't have to worry about the potential for civil unrest as a result of mass unemployment			1
economist @entity95 told me that a guaranteed minimum income would not only defuse the political crisis posed by worsening long - term unemployment , but would also open up the possibility of a reduction in the length of the work week			1
due partly to technological innovation , we already have a situation where less work is spread among more people , and this phenomenon will increase in the future			0
with a basic income , this development is nothing to fear			2
" once people have the freedom to elect to work less , their capacity to engage in the work of rebuilding community and democracy can increase far beyond what is possible in today 's precariously overworked society , " @entity95 said			0
at the moment , the idea of a guaranteed minimum income might be more popular with liberals than conservatives			1
but lately , conservative thinkers have become more outspoken in their support of the concept			0
philosopher @entity128 has made a libertarian case for a basic income			2
" conservatives care about limiting the power of government and increasing personal responsibility			0
... compared to our current welfare state , a basic income does both			1
instead of a vast bureaucracy of over 120 different antipoverty programs at the federal level , you 've got a program so simple it could be administered by a piece of software			0
" furthermore , he said , instead of subjecting the poor to a host of invasive , paternalistic and degrading requirements designed to make sure they 're behaving in ways the government approves of , a basic income gives them cash , and asks them to take responsibility for spending that money to improve their own condition			1
of course , all government programs have imperfections , and the basic income idea has an obvious one : there will still be people incapable of functioning in daily life — people who will spend their money before paying for basic necessities			2
what should be done about these " moochers " ? my answer is that housing shelters and soup kitchens could continue to exist , helping people who can not be helped in any other way			0
but the cost of these programs is just a tiny fraction of the overall safety net , and in cities with strong religious and philanthropic support , they would not need to be financed by the government at all			1
no one needs to sleep on the street			0
another objection : what if people want to work more , not less ? no problem			0
want multiple jobs ? go right ahead and take them			0
as advocates of a basic income point out , nothing would keep people from working and earning as much as they want			2
the global economy will experience big and small changes in the coming decades			0
we must do something to avoid a future of high unemployment and misery			0
a guaranteed minimal income is a way to start .			1

@entity207 : @entity19 should provide a monthly cash payment to every @entity19
@entity207 : a guaranteed minimum income can address unemployment issue
he says it would be a psychological benefit , lift the economy , and create stability
@entity207 : it is also cheaper than our current malfunctioning safety net
