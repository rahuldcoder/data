from a small office in downtown @entity1 with views of the snow - capped mountains in the distance , a man sobs as he stares at a photograph pinned to the chair of where his uncle used to sit			1
" where are you , @entity14 ? you will never come back			2
what should we do ? " pleads @entity15 as tears roll down his face			0
until a few days ago , this was the workplace of @entity20 , one of @entity22 's most prominent journalists , who was a senior reporter for @entity24			1

hotel staff say that when the young militants dressed in traditional garb pulled out their pistols , @entity20 's wife pleaded with them to kill her and not her family			1
instead , at point - blank range , they shot all of them in the head , killing @entity20 ; his wife , @entity46 ; their 6 - year - old daughter , @entity47 ; and their 4 - year son , @entity48			1
the only survivor is 2 - year - old @entity50 , who is in a coma with gunshot wounds to the head			2
" four days ago , @entity50 was playing on my lap. today , he is in a coma			2
but i 'm praying that he will also die			0
what 's the point of him living ? " cries @entity15 , @entity14 's nephew			2
" if he survives , what do i tell him ? that his family was all murdered ? but this baby is a fighter			0

@entity14 will live on in him			0
" the brutal attack that claimed nine lives -- four of them foreigners -- raises serious questions about the state of security in @entity22 's capital , with a presidential election less than two weeks away			1

but the @entity81 , which claimed responsibility for the shooting , have vowed to use force to disrupt the april 5 election			1
suicide bombings are increasing around the country , and earlier this month , @entity87 journalist @entity86 was gunned down in broad daylight on a busy street in the capital			0
" two weeks ago , @entity14 was talking to his friend about the @entity87 journalist			0
he was very saddened by his murder , " @entity15 said			0
" he told his friend , ' what if we face such a day and lose our life in such a cowardly attack ? ' he would think , ' if i 'm killed , what will happen to my family ? ' two weeks later , he 's killed			1
" @entity20 was a passionate journalist who cared deeply for his country			1
he had family members living in @entity107 who encouraged him to leave @entity22 and move overseas			1
but he would n't hear a word of it			0
" he 'd tell us it was n't time to leave , that there was still so much work to do to improve @entity22 , " said @entity110 , who worked in the same office as @entity20			1
" he was so kind and had so much love for this country and for journalism			0
he wanted to make a difference ; he had big dreams			0
he wanted to improve @entity22			1
it was n't his time for him to die ; this country needed him			0
this is the biggest shock for us			0
" with a heavy heart , trying to hold back tears , @entity110 said , " i felt like my father died			2
