@entity0 -- the @entity2 agreed monday to examine whether prosecutors can aggressively prosecute illegal immigrants for identity theft if they did n't know the documents they were given belonged to someone else			1
the @entity2 has agreed to grapple with the issues of identity theft and illegal immigration			1
the justices announced they will hear arguments in the appeal of a @entity15 national arrested in a government work site raid in the @entity17			2
a ruling is expected by june			1
at issue is whether people who use fake ids to obtain work in the @entity23 but did not know the documents belonged to someone else can be convicted of " aggravated identity theft			1
" stealing personal identification such as @entity29 numbers is illegal , but federal courts around the country are divided over how to treat people who buy them on the black market			1
federal law states that for aggravated identity theft to occur , it must be proved that a person " knowingly transfers , possesses , or uses , without lawful authority , a means of identification of another person			2
" many criminals steal a person 's identification to empty his or her bank account or falsely obtain loans or credit			2
lawyers for the detained illegal immigrants say their clients simply used numbers picked " out of thin air " that happened to belong to another person			1
they used the numbers only to obtain work , not steal to money , the lawyers said			2
the @entity56 argues its prosecutors need not prove " knowledge " that the documents belonged to someone else instead of being fabricated			1
the difference could mean an additional two years in federal prison under an enhanced sentence			0
most workers with false papers serve only a few months behind bars , and many are then deported			0
at stake is the government 's crackdown on undocumented workers , most of whom must rely on fake ids to obtain employment			0
read a report from the front lines of the immigration debate the case before the justices involves @entity15 immigrant @entity81 , who worked at a steel plant in @entity83 , @entity84			0
he was arrested with phony @entity29 and alien registration cards that had been assigned to someone else			0
he admitted obtaining the documents but said he did not know they were someone else 's			0
he was convicted and sentenced to 75 months in prison			0
the court did not act on a similar appeal from a @entity15 national who was arrested during a raid on a meat processing plant in @entity95 , the largest criminal workplace enforcement operation in @entity23 history			1
@entity100 was among 389 people arrested , most of whom were given five months in prison .			0

attorneys for illegal immigrants argue their clients used random numbers
@entity23 says prosecutors need not prove " knowledge " that @entity111 belongs to someone
