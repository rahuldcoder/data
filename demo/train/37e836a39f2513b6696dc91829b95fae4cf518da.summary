-- @entity3 @entity2 leaders announced they 've reached " broad agreement " on a package of provisions to replace the public option , a move that means their version of the health care bill is morphing into something that looks less and less like the @entity13 version			1
@entity3 leaders are n't releasing details of the revised plan , so it 's unclear how much of the bill will be changed			2
two @entity2 sources said the deal includes a proposal to replace the public option by creating a not - for - profit private insurance option overseen by the federal @entity23 , much like the current health plan for federal workers , and another allowing people 55 or older to buy into @entity28 coverage that currently is available to those 65 or older			1
the compromise appears to be a far cry from the government - backed public health care option offered in the @entity13 bill			1
the @entity3 's original health care bill included a public option similar to that of the @entity13 version			1
the biggest difference was that under the @entity3 plan , states could opt out of the public option			1
should the @entity3 pass a bill with the public option alternative , merging it with the @entity13 bill would not be easy , but there 's still a long ways to go before lawmakers get to that point			1
the @entity3 last month voted to begin debate on its version of the bill			1
since then , senate majority leader @entity51 has been making changes and trying to secure the 60 votes needed to end debate on the bill			1
a simple majority -- 51 votes -- is needed for final passage			0
after the @entity13 and @entity3 bills are merged , each chamber must give the consensus version final approval before it goes to president @entity64 's desk to be signed into law			1
the public option divide is just one of several differences that need to be ironed out			1
depending on what 's in the new @entity3 package , a lot of the details could change , but here are some of the other issues expected to be sticking points : abortion in the run - up to the @entity13 vote , @entity78 and conservative @entity2 joined forces to pass an amendment that tightens restrictions on federal funding for abortion services			1
the amendment would toughen funding limits in the health care bill , preventing subsidies not only from directly paying for abortions , but also from paying for any insurance plan that covers abortions			2
the prohibition excludes cases of rape , incest , or if the mother 's life is in danger			0
the @entity3 rejected a similar amendment but will allow the @entity101 secretary to decide whether abortion coverage would be granted under a government - sponsored plan and will permit coverage in private plans			1
but this is now subject to change , depending on the details of the @entity3 public option alternative			1
@entity111 expansion @entity111 , the government - run health care plan for the poor , would be expanded significantly under both proposals			0
the @entity13 bill would extend coverage to individuals earning up to 150 percent of the poverty line , or roughly $ 33,000 for a family of four			2
the original @entity3 plan ensured coverage to those earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level , or just over $ 29,000 for a family of four			0
this is subject to change , depending on the final @entity3 plan			0
individual mandate under both plans , individuals would be required to purchase coverage , but the @entity13 bill includes more stringent penalties for most of those who fail to comply			2
the @entity3 plan would require individuals to buy health insurance , with a fine for noncompliance of $ 95 in the first year that would escalate to $ 750 by 2016			0
parents would be responsible for providing coverage for children up to age 18			0
the @entity13 bill would impose a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income			2
both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer @entity147			0
employer mandate employers face a much stricter mandate under the @entity13 legislation , which would require companies with a payroll of more than $ 500,000 to provide insurance or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll			2
the @entity3 bill would require companies with more than 50 employees to pay a fee of up to $ 750 per worker if their employees rely on government subsidies to purchase coverage			1
the @entity13 and @entity3 have agreed to create health insurance exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses , the self - employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less - expensive coverage			2
the @entity13 plan creates a national health insurance exchange ; the @entity3 plan calls for state health insurance exchanges in all 50 states			1
illegal immigration both bills state that subsidies can not go to undocumented workers , but differ in how they enforce that			0
they also differ on how easy it should be for illegal immigrants to buy health insurance with their own money			0
in general , the @entity13 bill gives illegal immigrants more opportunity to buy health insurance and would verify their identity in fewer areas			2
proponents say it 's more humane and cost - effective			0
opponents say it 's simply more liberal and would encourage more people to illegally enter the @entity147 @entity3 bill , in contrast , would mandate verification in more areas and would sharply limit the ability of undocumented workers to buy their own health insurance			1
both bills ban any government funds or subsidies from going to help illegal immigrants get health care			0
@entity2 say they will tightly enforce that ; opponents sharply question the enforcement in the bill			0
cost the @entity13 bill is more expansive -- and hence expensive -- than the @entity3 bill			1
the @entity13 bill , projected to guarantee coverage for 96 percent of @entity147 , will cost more than $ 1 trillion over the next 10 years , according to the nonpartisan @entity212			2
the original @entity3 bill was estimated to cover 94 percent of @entity147 and came with an $ 848 billion price tag , according to the @entity212			1
the @entity212 has not yet released an estimate of the new @entity3 plan			0
financing one of the biggest divides between @entity13 and @entity3 @entity2 is over how to pay for the plans			1
the @entity13 package is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy @entity147 and new spending constraints in @entity28 and @entity111			2
specifically , individuals with annual incomes over $ 500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $ 1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge			0
the @entity3 measure also trims entitlement programs such as @entity28 and @entity111			0
the bill also includes a range of tax increases and new fees			0
the @entity28 payroll tax on individuals earning $ 200,000 a year and couples earning $ 250,000 a year would increase by a half - percentage point , from the current 1.45 percent to 1.95 percent			0
in addition , insurers providing costly health coverage -- known as " @entity241 " plans -- would face a 40 percent tax on premiums of greater than $ 8,500 for individuals and $ 23,000 for families			0
the @entity3 bill also includes a 5 percent tax on the cost of elective cosmetic surgery , as well as new fees for insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers			1
the revenue from all the taxes and fees is projected to exceed $ 200 billion			0
@entity0 's @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 still has to vote to end debate , pass bill , then merge it with @entity13 version
@entity13 version tightens restrictions on abortion funding ; @entity3 bill does not
@entity13 version creates public option ; @entity273 reached agreement on alternate package
how to pay for the plans is another sticking point
