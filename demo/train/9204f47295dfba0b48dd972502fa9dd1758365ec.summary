-- there 'll be an old familiar face on " @entity3 : the @entity4 " tonight -- at least to anyone born before 1998			1
@entity6 , the most famous wookiee of the @entity7 , is making his debut on the animated show 's season 3 finale			1
and this time , he 's not voiced by some bear in @entity12 , @entity13 , like @entity6 was in the 1977 " @entity3 " movie ( now referred to as " @entity15			1
" ) the original guy - in - the - hair - suit , @entity16 , voices the furry alien he brought to life all those years ago , and according to him , @entity6 is a little bit younger and less experienced than the @entity6 most fans are familiar with			1
" you take the ' @entity4 ' @entity6 and put him up against a picture of the ' @entity3 ' @entity6 and they 're nearly identical , " he said			1
" the magic is around the eyes , but also they got the character right			2
" that 's probably because " @entity4 " supervising director @entity29 made sure @entity16 came to the @entity30 so the show 's artists could learn how the original @entity6 walked , moved his head and made facial expressions			1
" @entity3 : the @entity4 " is an animated show from @entity36 and @entity37 ( whose parent company , @entity38 , also owns @entity0 )			1
it chronicles the adventures of the @entity43 knights -- including a @entity44 -- during a time of unrest in a galaxy far , far away			0
the movies , " @entity52 " ( 2002 ) and " @entity53 " ( 2005 ) feature action from " @entity4 , " as well , but the cartoon takes place before the latter			1
" @entity4 " has also been diving into characters from what @entity56 and fans refer to as the " @entity3 " extended universe , something @entity29 is thoroughly geeking out about			1
" the @entity61 presents a ton of different ideas on all kinds of levels , and i do n't think i would say there 's anything that 's out of bounds			1
but i am very careful with it because there are huge , huge fans of those things in very specific niches , " he said			0
" like [ the near - human @entity43 tracker ] @entity76 was such a big deal , i thought , when we brought him out , " he said			0
" the interesting thing that i 've come to realize is that a lot of kids ' first contact with @entity3 is ' @entity4			1
' so they have a completely different point of view than like the older fans that i 'll talk to at conventions			0
and those two groups have completely different concerns , " @entity29 said			0
' @entity91 , ' @entity56 and ' @entity92 ' for example , many young fans of " @entity4 " believe that the clones and @entity44 are really good guys , he said			1
but older fans who have seen " @entity53 " know that the ultimate betrayal is brewing			0
and older fans know about @entity99 , princess @entity100 , @entity101 and other characters that , although are not portrayed in " @entity4 , " are tied to the events that unfold within the cartoon series			1
tonight 's introduction of @entity6 might be the first time some kids come into contact with the tall , lovable @entity6 , @entity29 said			1
" so now , they 'll know him as this character that was on the ' @entity4 ' with the sofitano , and when they see ' @entity15 ' they 'll look at him and go , ' oh , that 's the guy that was with the [ @entity44 's @entity43 padawan , @entity119 ] , ' which is completely different from how we older fans remember it , " he said			2
@entity16 , always mobbed at fan conventions , knows that today 's children will love @entity6 just as much as children in the 1970s and 1980s did			2
" i think it 's because he is so friendly , " @entity16 said			0
" and he is a cuddly teddy bear			0
he 's like the next door neighbor who looks after everybody			0
he 's the big brother , the security blanket , and this appeals to a lot of people			0
@entity6 is very special to a lot of people , and especially to me			2
" how @entity137 used " @entity138 " older fans love @entity6 for his heroism , said @entity140 , the manager of @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity143			2
" in a nutshell , he goes on to be a great hero and he dies saving a lot of lives , " she said			0
" he gets one of the coolest deaths in the @entity7			0
a planet crashes into him			0
well , a moon , technically			0
" @entity29 knows there are those fans who scrutinize the introduction of @entity6			2
" when we do a character like @entity6 and there 's an immense amount of continuity going on with the icon characters like that , we have to be very careful			1
so in some ways the less i say about specifics the better , you know ? i do n't even have to get in to some of that stuff to tell the stories that i 'm telling , " @entity29 said			2
why would some fans be so worked up about whether or not " @entity4 " gets @entity6 right ? " we really grew up with these movies , " @entity140 said			1
" these were the things we turned to when we were bored or we were upset			0
in my case , my parents were n't home , and these were my babysitters sometimes			0
certainly not every day , but i definitely watched " @entity3 " a ton when i was growing up			2
and i think it inhabits a place in your psyche and your heart where you sit down , you watch it and everything 's ok			0

ready for a dose of @entity6 ? tune in to @entity37 tonight at 8 p.m. est
