two @entity1 sculptures of a nude man riding a panther may have been created by @entity5 , says a @entity7 museum			1
the @entity8 in @entity9 says that the bronze sculptures , known as the @entity11 and dating from the 1500s , were probably created just after the famed artist 's @entity13 and just before he painted the ceiling of the @entity17 's @entity16			1
the museum and researchers at the @entity9 say they have " compelling evidence " that the works , attributed to a @entity23 sculptor , are actually from @entity5			1
if so , they are the only surviving @entity5 bronzes in the world , says the museum			2
the key clue that the unsigned bronzes were actually done by @entity5 came from one of the master 's apprentices			1
last year , @entity32 , a @entity9 art history professor , noted that a @entity5 student had made a study of several @entity5 sketches for works believed lost			1
one of the drawings in the study , which dates from 1508 , matched one of the bronzes			0
further research indicated they were in @entity5 's style , and x-rays roughly confirmed the era of their creation			2
" even a peroneal tendon is visible , as is the transverse arch of the foot , " wrote @entity49 anatomist @entity48 , according to the @entity50			0
@entity54 , keeper of applied arts at the @entity8 , described the project to the @entity50 as " a @entity1 whodunit			0
" she says that the museum was careful in assembling the evidence and that the works are masterpieces			0
" the modeling is superb , they are so powerful and so compelling , so whoever made them had to be superb , " she said			0
the works -- and some of the evidence -- will be on display at the @entity8 from tuesday through august 9			0
though the museum is confident of the works ' origins , research is continuing , and results will be presented at a conference in early july .			2

formerly obscure works are believed to be by @entity5
the bronze sculptures will go on display at a museum in @entity9 , @entity79
key clue was a study from an apprentice in early 16th *century*
