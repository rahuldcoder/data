-- men in their 70s and 80s may be more likely than women of the same age to develop the memory loss and cognitive problems that often herald alzheimer 's disease , a new study has found			1
in the study , which appears in the journal @entity14 , @entity11 researchers examined 1,450 elderly people in @entity16 every 15 months for an average of three and a half years			0
during that time , 7.2 % of the men and 5.7 % of the women developed the mental - function problems known as mild cognitive impairment ( @entity21 ) , with or without any accompanying memory loss			1
the findings surprised the researchers because previous studies have suggested that more women than men ultimately go on to develop @entity27 's and other forms of full - blown dementia			2
the fact that men appear to have higher rates of @entity21 but lower rates of dementia may hold important clues for preventing or delaying cognitive decline , the researchers suggest			1
@entity0 : 25 signs and symptoms of @entity27 's disease the lead author of the study , @entity39 , a professor of epidemiology at the @entity11 , in @entity42 , @entity16 , says that women with @entity21 may progress to dementia faster than men , causing them to be under - counted during the @entity21 phase			1
but sex - related differences in physiology and brain function may also play a role			1
@entity21 is n't necessarily a permanent condition			0
roughly one - third of the study participants who received an @entity21 diagnosis following a battery of tests and interviews subsequently improved to the point that they no longer met the diagnostic criteria at a later checkup			2
this so - called reversion to normal , which has been seen in other studies , may indicate that in some cases the brain actually repairs some of the damage it incurs -- and this may be where sex differences come into play , says @entity70 , @entity71 , a professor of geriatric medicine at @entity73 , in @entity74 , @entity75			1
@entity0 : 7 ways to protect your memory physical activity , for instance , is believed to benefit men differently than women , says @entity70 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study but was not involved in the new research			2
in women , exercise appears to be more likely to prolong life , he says , while in men it 's more likely to improve brain function			1
" we might be seeing the cognitive benefits of exercise in men " in the study findings , @entity90 says			2
" women who exercise also get some cognitive benefit , but they appear to get a greater survival benefit			0
" the findings suggest also that men may be more vulnerable than women to certain risk factors for @entity21 , says @entity100 , @entity101 , director of behavioral neurology at the @entity103 , in @entity104			2
@entity0 : memory , mental function begin slipping as early as age 45 high blood pressure , obesity , diabetes , and other known -- and treatable -- risk factors for @entity21 and dementia tend to be more common in men , which may explain the higher rate of @entity21 , @entity100 says			1
" what [ the study ] tells us is that , particularly in men , there are probably a whole set of factors that we have to consider as particular to their gender or lifestyle , or both , that are impacting them a lot earlier , " @entity100 says			0
" we need to take a step back and ask if we are really doing the job we need to control the things we know are modifiable			0
" although @entity39 and her colleagues did n't investigate risk factors such as high blood pressure , they did take into account other factors that have been shown to affect @entity21 risk , such as age , educational attainment , and marital status			0
( people with more education and people who were married had lower rates of @entity21 than the other study participants -- a pattern that has been observed in previous studies			1
) @entity0 : staying healthy from head to toe may help ward off dementia incorporating these factors into the data helped the researchers rule out the possibility that sex disparities in @entity21 and dementia rates are due merely to the fact that women tend to live longer , and are therefore more likely than men to live long enough to develop dementia			1
more research will be needed to confirm the findings , however			0
although the new study was thorough and well designed , @entity100 says , the definition of @entity21 remains open to interpretation			0
a particular doctor or nurse may be more likely to arrive at an @entity21 diagnosis than another health professional looking at the same patient , which makes it difficult to draw broad conclusions about the prevalence of the condition			0
" we do n't have good standard markers of what @entity21 is , " @entity100 says			0

during study 7.2 % of men and 5.7 % of women developed mild cognitive impairment
men appear to have higher rates of @entity21 but lower rates of dementia
