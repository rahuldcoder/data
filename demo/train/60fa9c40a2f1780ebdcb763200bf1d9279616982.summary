-- @entity1 looks so femme fatale - tastic staring out from the poster for " @entity3 , " with her black wig and heavily lined eyes , that it 's hard to imagine that the title role in the movie was actually written for a guy			1
but , yes , it 's true -- @entity3 was originally scripted as @entity11			1
and lame name aside , the role was intended for @entity14			2
it was only when @entity14 backed out that the movie 's makers rethought the part and decided to cast @entity1 instead , which was a seriously good move			1

but the role was originally written as " @entity66			1
" it was @entity63 's wife 's idea to cast @entity57 instead			2
do we have her to thank for @entity71 on " @entity72 , " in some tangential way ? @entity74 ousted @entity75 in 2005 's " @entity79 , " @entity75 initially was courted to play @entity76 , a father desperately searching for his missing daughter on an international flight			0
