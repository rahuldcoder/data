@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is far from the first singer to make the transition from music to movies			2
however , the " @entity9 " star is blazing a whole new trail with his latest crossover venture			2
@entity3 voices " mayhem , " a hero described as the " embodiment of raw justice and vengeance			1
" the actor / singer / model has partnered with @entity18 to develop his own comic book series called " mayhem , " and he 's doing it in a very nontraditional way -- digitally			1
" there was an experience that i felt was pretty limiting as far as the comic book experience itself on paper , " says @entity3 , who stresses that he did not grow up reading comic books and is not a comic book veteran			1
" [ so ] i set up this technology with my team and this is the first - ever digital comic book [ on @entity31 ] in the history of comic books			1
" the third issue of " mayhem , " which is downloadable from @entity31 , is the first to go digital			2
it features an interactive version of a comic book with sound effects , page turns and even voiceover			1
@entity3 himself voices the title character , a masked , dagger - hurling hero described as the " embodiment of raw justice and vengeance			1
" @entity3 's new hobby is another example of @entity51 's love affair with comic books			1
just last month , @entity53 acquired @entity54 -- and all 5,000 of the comic book company 's characters -- for $ 4 billion in cash and stock			1
with the success of action films based on comic book notables , including " @entity63 , " " @entity64 " and " @entity65 , " it 's not a stretch to think that @entity3 might be strapping on the " mayhem " costume for a summer blockbuster in the future			1
but for now , @entity3 is focused on the early stages of his new venture			2
although he would not provide details on sales figures , he did say that worldwide sales of " mayhem " would " knock your socks off			0
" the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity2 : what turned you on to comic books ? @entity3 : i went out to @entity85 about a year or so ago to promote the film " @entity87			2
" when i was out there , i really got to know some of the fans and i was just asking questions like , " look at you , you 've got a full on @entity89 costume on or @entity63 costume , " and they were just like , " i just love comic books			0
" it was the first time i was ever exposed to that much selfless passion , to the point to where you do n't care how silly you may look -- you do n't even consider it silly			0
... that really did something for me , because i 'm motivated by passion			0
i thought ... i want to figure a way to be a part of this world , and that 's when " mayhem " was born			0
" @entity2 : where did the story of " mayhem " come from ? @entity3 : me and my partner @entity113 and @entity114 all got together , we started brainstorming about different concepts and different directions we could send this character in and we came up with something pretty unique			2
it 's an ongoing series and so as soon as you think you 've got it figured out , there 's a cliffhanger that makes you want to read the second issue and the third issue			0
@entity2 : you 're a newcomer to this genre			0
what 's been the feedback from the comic book community ? @entity3 : in everything you do , there 's gon na be cynics and those folks questioning what your motivation is behind getting into anything			1
i dealt with it when i went from one career move to the next : " man , stick to singing ; stick to acting			0
" i dealt with a lot of that from certain folks in the comic book world			1
... they wrote these long e-mails and [ started ] on a smear campaign			0
i came into this whole thing very innocent			0
i discovered my love for comic books and i want as many people as possible to experience my comic book			1
there 's this digital revolution that 's out there but the comic book world has not embraced this digital revolution on a level that it should be embraced on			1
and so i reached out to my contacts and i set up a meeting ... and this is my baby			0
@entity2 : artist @entity164 is very big in the comic book world			1
how did he get involved in this project ? @entity3 : i found @entity164 on @entity167 ... and we just kind of took it from there			2
@entity2 : what did you learn from him ? @entity3 : so much , so much			2
he basically made me aware of all of the big players in the comic world like @entity176 and @entity177			0
he just painted this picture about who 's who in the comic book world and he schooled me on that level			1
@entity2 : a lot of comic book characters become heroes on the big screen			1
does " mayhem " have a future in film ? @entity3 : right now , there is no conversation on any level about " mayhem " becoming a film			0
we 've been approached a few times but my mind state is this : you ca n't expect to sell out the @entity198 until you sell a bunch of records			0
so we 're really trying to establish the fan base for " mayhem " before we try to turn it into film			0
there 's still plenty of time for that .			0
