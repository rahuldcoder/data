@entity0 , @entity1 -- during the course of his long run for the presidency , @entity3 has consistently presented himself to voters as a " turnaround " artist , or as his supporters have taken to calling him recently , a " mr. fix - it			1
" in making his closing argument to voters that he should have that chance to take his government tool belt to @entity16 , @entity3 has vowed to " bring people together , " to govern as president			1
" i 've got be able to reach across the aisle and get good @entity25 and good @entity26 to work together , " the former @entity20 governor told a crowd in @entity22 , @entity23 , on wednesday			0
if @entity27 wins a second term ... " my legislature was about 85 % @entity30 and it was not lost on me that to get anything done at all , and even to have my veto upheld , i had to have people across the aisle i could work with , " he continued			0
@entity3 's critics insist the @entity26 candidate 's bipartisan overtures are in need of a serious reality check			1
they look no farther than his statement to last february 's gathering of the @entity42 in @entity16			0
" i fought long odds in a deep blue state			0
but i was a severely conservative @entity26 governor , " @entity3 told the conference			1
@entity3 defends his ' severely conservative ' record the words " severely " and " conservative " are no longer part of @entity3 pitch with the campaign in the home stretch			2
asked how @entity3 's promises of bipartisanship align with what quickly became a @entity57 moment at @entity42 last winter , a senior campaign adviser argued the two claims are not mutually exclusive			1
" as governor , he brought people together to deal with health care			2
he 's brought people together to deal with a very big deficit that he had when he came into office , " said @entity62 , one of @entity3 's top strategists			1
@entity3 : my vision for @entity71 trying to bring together competing ideas , philosophies " the governor has made a point that he is going to try to bring together all of the competing ideas and philosophies in @entity16 in order to tackle some of the big challenges			1
does he recognize there is going to be opposition ? sure , " @entity62 added			0
in fact , @entity3 's aides have quietly begun laying the groundwork for a presidential transition , should he win the @entity87			1
dubbed the " @entity92 " and led by former @entity91 gov. @entity90 , the transition team has already had at least one meeting with senior @entity26 lawmakers , a top congressional source told @entity2			1
what would a @entity95 @entity87 look like ? " they 're interested in recommendations for @entity101 posts , " the congressional source , who was not authorized to speak about the subject publicly , said			0
the advance legwork could enable @entity3 to sidestep some of the problems he encountered nearly a decade ago when he entered the governor 's office in @entity106			1
@entity107 , a government watchdog with the non-partisan @entity109 , said @entity3 's experience in the business world left him ill - prepared for the unwieldy mix of liberal lawmakers , advocacy groups and news media that confronted him			1
who might serve on @entity3 's national security team " it was a rude awakening for the @entity3 administration , " @entity119 said			1
" early on , the legislature and the @entity3 administration were at loggerheads			1
" but his passage of health care reform in the state demonstrated the self - styled " chief executive " governor was able to find his way and work across party lines			0
" there was a spirit of bipartisanship around health reform , " @entity119 said			0
the spirit was hard to miss. at the signing ceremony for his signature legislative achievement , @entity3 had none other than an old political nemesis and liberal icon , the late sen. @entity142 , at his side			2
after overcoming a @entity26 primary season in which @entity3 's health care reform plan was mocked as " @entity148 , " aides to the former governor now dub the initiative " successful			1
" where candidates stand on key issues different environment than governor 's office if elected president , however , @entity3 would inherit a dramatically different political environment			1
sandwiched between tea party @entity26 who have little patience for compromise and a potentially vengeful contingent of defeated @entity25 , a president @entity3 would have no shortage of challenges			2
@entity27 : my vision for @entity71 adding to the potential for gridlock , a longtime aide to senate majority leader @entity167 said the @entity25 leader from @entity171 hardly knows @entity3			2
earlier this year , @entity167 outraged conservatives when he falsely accused @entity3 of failing to pay income taxes for a decade			2
@entity167 hits @entity3 over taxes , ' 47 % ' comments " when he looks at @entity3 , he sees a weak candidate , a poll - driven politician , someone who lacks any core conviction , " @entity167 's former spokesman @entity176 said			2
one potential flashpoint could be any attempt by @entity3 to make good on a campaign promise to partially privatize the nation 's @entity183 system for future seniors			1
" if he tries to go at core @entity25 priorities , like @entity187 tried to do with his proposal to privatize @entity191 , @entity167 will go at him hammer and tong , just like he and ( @entity194 ) @entity193 did with @entity187 , " @entity176 said of former president @entity187 's second term initiative to transform the federal retirement program			0
perhaps the greatest challenge facing a potential @entity3 administration would be the nation 's mounting debt			1
it remains unclear whether the upcoming lame - duck @entity200 will have the political will necessary to avert what is a largely unspoken campaign issue , the looming fiscal cliff in @entity16			0
republicans and @entity25 in @entity200 , along with the president , set the nation on the perilous legislative course when they passed the @entity209 , which mandates both tax increases and massive spending cuts that take effect at the end of the year , unless a compromise is reached			0
candidates mum on fiscal cliff if a solution is not found , @entity3 could enter the @entity87 with a country that is reeling from what many economists agree would be a massive jolt to the economy			2
facing resistance from tea party on more revenue back in @entity20 , the then - governor solved his own fiscal crisis with a mixture of spending cuts and fee increases			0
but to conservative @entity26 in @entity16 , revenue enhancers are viewed as deal - breakers			0
" the tea party is not going to let him do that			0
the tea party is going to resist that mightily , " @entity119 said			0
but @entity3 made clear in the presidential debates he is comfortable shifting back to the center when it is politically advantageous			0
what @entity25 label " etch - a - sketching " and " @entity242 , " one @entity3 aide said the candidate is simply articulating his positions in a way that would make them more palatable to " swing voters			0
" @entity3 's @entity249 makeover after a sometimes painful , yet eventually successful wooing of tea party conservatives , @entity3 now openly embraces more centrist views on regulation			2
" sometimes people in our party say we want to deregulate but that 's kind of an overstatement , " @entity3 told the @entity22 rally			1
" we want to get rid of excessive regulation and outmoded regulation			0
but we have to have some regulation to make the economy work and for people to be able to play by the rules , " he added			0
after a lifetime in business and @entity20 politics , a president @entity3 would arrive in @entity16 as a newcomer			0
as @entity3 boasted during the @entity26 primaries , he would enter the nation 's capital having never worked in the hyper - partisan world nestled on the @entity274			1
who might serve on @entity3 's national security team ? @entity20 accents in the @entity87 but do not expect @entity3 to be lonely at the @entity87			1
as recent history has shown , governors who ascend to the presidency , such as @entity187 and @entity280 , usually have a colorful entourage of statehouse advisers and friends who come along for the ride			0
if @entity3 's management of this presidential campaign is any guide , he is likely to bring with him a slew of political professionals from his days in @entity106			1
several top advisers in @entity3 's inner circle , former @entity294 executive @entity293 , @entity106 political strategist @entity295 and communications guru @entity296 , speak with a thick @entity20 accent			2
another pivotal player to watch is @entity299 , who was @entity3 's chief of staff during his days as governor and led his vice presidential search that culminated in what is widely regarded as the politically successful selection of @entity71 rep. @entity304 of @entity1			1
exclusive : how @entity3 chose his running mate @entity62 declined to discuss a potential senior team in a @entity3 @entity87 but conceded the @entity26 contender has a history of taking care of his own			2
" he is a loyal guy			0
but i think he wants the best and the brightest with him to help solve big problems , " @entity62 said .			0

@entity3 has vowed , if elected , to " bring people together "
transition team , dubbed " @entity92 " is already laying groundwork
@entity319 could help @entity3 sidestep some of the same problems he encountered as governor
perhaps the greatest challenge facing a @entity3 administration would be the nation 's debt
