@entity0 -- it is one of @entity5 's favorite selling points			1
@entity5 often notes that as governor of @entity7 , he worked with a mostly @entity9 legislature to tackle his state 's problems			1
" it did not take a rocket scientist to figure out if i was going to do anything as governor , i had to have a working relationship with the @entity20 , " @entity5 said at a campaign event last year in @entity13 , @entity14			1
but inside the @entity28 , down the hallway from @entity5 's official portrait that hangs inside the governor 's office , longtime lawmakers on both sides of the aisle remember a more ceo - style leader			1
@entity31 , the second - ranking @entity32 in the @entity33 , said @entity5 tried to carry over the corporate culture that existed at his former private investment firm , @entity35 , in a way that sometimes alienated @entity20 who were accustomed to a different way of doing things			1
" he was all business			2
it was all about policy			0
he did n't trade jobs for votes			0
he did n't trade capital projects for votes			0
so that came back to bite him a little bit , " @entity31 said			0
@entity5 replaced many of the career bureaucrats in the executive staff with private sector outsiders			1
at times , @entity31 argued , that management structure produced results in balancing the state 's budget			2
" some democrats begrudgingly , maybe not publicly on camera , but privately will admit that he had a lot of great , talented people around him who got the job done , " @entity31 said			0
across the aisle , @entity5 still gets positive reviews for his willingness to work with @entity20 to pass health care reform			1
however , many rank - and - file democrats are still bothered by what they describe as a distant and guarded leader			0
" he had three security people around him , and you could never get to touch him or say hello , " said state rep. @entity70 , chairman of the @entity71 on @entity72 and @entity73			0
" he was very elitist			0
" on this reporter 's unannounced visit to the @entity79 , there was no shortage of @entity9 lawmakers who complained about @entity5 's unprecedented move to block off one @entity84 elevator specifically for the governor 's office			1
" he took over the elevator for the west wing of the building			0
he kept it only for his staff and him , " @entity70 said			0
listening in on @entity70 's comments , another @entity92 , state rep. @entity93 , said the elevator restrictions and security ropes installed outside @entity5 's office turned off some lawmakers for good			1
" when @entity5 came in , he treated government like the only thing he ever knew , which was big business , and he was the ceo of the big business , " @entity99 said			2
another lawmaker , @entity9 state rep. @entity103 , was far more blunt in his feelings about @entity5			2
" many people said , ' good riddance			0
do n't let the door hit you on the way out , ' " @entity103 quipped about @entity5 's decision to forgo a second term to run for the presidency in 2008			1
aides to the @entity5 campaign chalked up some of the hard feelings among @entity20 to election - time loyalties to president @entity116			1
but the campaign called on another @entity9 lawmaker , state rep. @entity117 , to offer some positive comments on @entity5 's time as governor			1
" i think you 're getting a lot of partisan political comments , " @entity117 said in reference to the @entity9 criticism of @entity5			2
" did he have an ego ? absolutely , " @entity117 said			0
" but what do you expect ? " he asked , describing @entity5 as " high - caliber			1
" " he wanted to turn the company around , " @entity117 said about @entity5 's hope to fix the state 's fiscal problems			1
" i had a positive relationship with him			0
i know that some people did not			0
" @entity136 , a government watchdog with the nonpartisan @entity138 , noted @entity5 set aside his ceo approach to woo @entity9 leaders to pass health care reform			1
the law -- widely considered to be @entity5 's signature achievement -- is memorialized in his official @entity84 portrait , sitting on a small table along with a framed picture of the former governor 's wife , @entity148 @entity5 struggled in other areas such as job creation , @entity152 said , in part because of the governor 's ceo style			1
however , @entity5 was beginning to divert his attention to pursuing the @entity157 , @entity152 and other state lawmakers recalled			2
" he clearly had his sights set on running nationally , " @entity152 said			0
" that was no secret			0
certainly not among the political leaders			0
" @entity84 insiders , such as @entity152 , often contrast @entity5 's style with another recent @entity32 governor , @entity164 , who seemed to revel in the kind of behind - closed - doors backslapping that @entity20 had come to expect over the years			1
" governors are n't @entity168			0
they just are n't , " @entity152 said			0
@entity9 leaders , who now dominate the @entity28 and control the governor 's office , gleefully note the rope lines are gone and the @entity5 executive elevator has since been reopened to the general public			1
@entity5 's @entity9 successor , gov. @entity175 , conceded he made those changes after taking office			1
" i 'm a governor of , with and for the people			2
we have a different style in that respect , " @entity175 said , adding he has great respect for @entity5			2
@entity117 noted @entity175 has also upset @entity9 lawmakers with his reform efforts			2
" you can pick apart any of these guys , " @entity117 said .			0
