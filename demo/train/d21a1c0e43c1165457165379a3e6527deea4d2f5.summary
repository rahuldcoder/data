-- for a few minutes thursday evening , @entity1 was redirecting users visiting dozens of websites -- including @entity4 and @entity0 -- to cryptic error pages			1
the reaction online was pretty much what you 'd expect , with -- as @entity9 noted -- hashtags like " @entity11 " and " @entity12 " common amongst @entity14 users			0
so what happened , exactly ? there was an issue with the @entity18 that caused users on sites that use that @entity18 to redirect users to a @entity1 error page			1
for example , if you were visiting @entity4 and logged into our site using your @entity1 account ( and you were also signed into @entity1 ) , you were automatically redirected to a @entity1 error page			1
exiting the page or attempting to re-access the original site would lead to another			0
sites such as @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and hundreds of others were all impacted			1
the bug lasted less than 10 minutes			2
in a statement , @entity1 told @entity4 : " for a short period of time , there was a bug that redirected people logging in with @entity1 from third party sites			2
the issue was quickly resolved and @entity47 with @entity1 is now working as usual			0
" the bug may have been brief , but it has highlighted just how many important websites use @entity18 for user authentication			0
over the span of just a few years , @entity1 logins have become so pervasive that they are nearly second nature			0
it also shows that if @entity1 has an issue , it can affect more than just its site -- it can also impact the hundreds of thousands ( millions ? ) of sites that integrate with @entity1 's apis			2
what 's interesting is that a user did n't even need to be performing the action for the error -- and hijacking -- to occur			0
instead , simply being logged into both places ( and having the accounts linked ) was enough to force users off of a third - party website and onto @entity1 's error page			1

@entity1 error causes other sites to crash for users
the *problem* , with @entity1 's log - in tool , last about 10 minutes
@entity0 , @entity4 , @entity32 , @entity34 , @entity36 among the sites impacted
