-- a judge sentenced a self - help expert to a total of two years in prison friday for his role in the deaths of three people in a 2009 sweat lodge ceremony in the @entity10 desert			1
prosecutors had sought consecutive three - year sentences for @entity13 on each of the three counts of negligent homicide on which a jury convicted him			2
the judge instead imposed three two - year terms , to be served concurrently			0
@entity13 and his attorneys asked for probation , but judge @entity21 said the evidence shows " extreme negligence on the part of mr. @entity13			2
" " a prison sentence is just mandated in this case , " he said			0
during the trial , prosecutors argued that @entity13 's recklessness caused the deaths of @entity31 , 38 , of @entity32 , @entity33 ; @entity34 , 40 , of @entity35 ; and @entity36 , 49 , of @entity37 , @entity38			1
at least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill. the lodge , made of willow trees and branches and covered with tarpaulins and blankets , was heated to a perilously high temperature , causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke , prosecutors alleged			0
they also said @entity13 did n't monitor the temperature inside the lodge or the well - being of participants and was indifferent to those having trouble			2
@entity13 's lawyers countered that the deaths were the result of a tragic accident , not a crime			1
they asked witnesses who were in the sweat lodge whether they signed a release form warning them of the dangers			0
@entity67 replied that they signed , but some said they did n't read the form			0
@entity13 's attorneys also suggested that exposure to an unknown toxin in the lodge -- perhaps a pesticide , rat poison or something in the type of wood used to heat the rocks -- could have caused the deaths			1
@entity13 tearfully told the court that he has " no excuse " for what happened that october day or since			0
" at the end of the day , i lost three friends , and i lost them on my watch , " he said			0
" and whatever errors in judgment or mistakes i made , i 'm going to have to live with those for the rest of my life			0
" @entity13 asked @entity21 to sentence him to probation , saying he is no threat to society and promising never to conduct another sweat lodge ceremony again			1
" it pains me beyond belief to be here today , with the best of intentions gone wrong , " he said			0
before @entity21 announced his judgment , prosecutor @entity101 characterized @entity13 as a dangerous " pretender " who had cast himself as a victim of an overzealous prosecution			2
and relatives of the victims told @entity21 that @entity13 has done little to redeem himself and that he deserved the maximum possible sentence of nine years in prison			1
" my heart 's been ripped out			1
my life has been blown apart , and the pieces are yet to land , " said @entity112 , @entity31 's mother .			1

@entity13 is sentenced to a total of two years in prison
three people died in 2009 after participating in ceremony led by @entity13
" my heart 's been ripped out , " one victim 's mother says at sentencing hearing
