-- in a potential landmark case , a @entity2 teenager is on trial this week after prosecutors say his texting while driving caused a crash that led to the death of a 55 - year - old man			1
@entity11 's trial got underway tuesday in @entity12 , with opening statements and the prosecution beginning to present its case			1
the first few days of the trial included testimony by the victim 's family and a crash survivor , the replaying of @entity11 's original interview with police and a visit to the crash site , as the defendant looked on from afar			1
almost exactly one year earlier , the then - 17 - year - old @entity11 pleaded not guilty to a host of charges tied to the fatal february 20 , 2011 , crash , the @entity32 district attorney 's office said in a press release at the time			1
those charges were motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation , negligent operation of a motor vehicle , being an operator under 18 using a mobile phone , being an operator reading or sending an electronic message , a marked lanes violation and two counts of negligent operation and injury from mobile phone use			0
some 38 states ban text messaging for all drivers while 31 prohibit all cell phone use by " novice drivers , " according to the @entity53			0
yet @entity11 's case is thought to be unique , in that his texting is being linked to another person 's death			2
prosecutors allege that @entity11 was texting when his car crossed the center line and hit a vehicle being driven by @entity62 , a resident of @entity63 , @entity64			2
@entity62 's girlfriend , @entity65 , was in his car with him and suffered serious injuries			0
@entity12 detective @entity68 testified this week that the two " were almost folded into the floorboards , " the impact was so severe			2
@entity62 died march 10 , after he was taken off life support			0
" my brother received such head trauma that ... there was no hope for him , " @entity62 's sister , @entity72 , said this week in court			0
according to reports from several @entity0 affiliates , prosecutors claim that @entity11 received and sent a total of 193 text messages on the day of the crash , including several around the time the accident occurred			2
during her opening remarks , assistant district attorney @entity84 suggested that @entity11 may have erased some of his texts or fibbed to police after the accident			1
" he states the last message that he received was at 2:33 ( p.m. ) , and then shows the officer the next message is at 3:10 , " @entity90 said			0
" when records were received , it 's learned : there are two ( texts ) missing			0
" @entity11 said after the crash in a taped interview with police , which was played in court this week , " i was tired			1
when i looked away for one quick second , i came too close to her and i was trying to hit my brakes			0
" his defense lawyer claimed authorities set out from the beginning to link texting to the crash , a cause - and - effect relationship that he contends is not valid			1
@entity110 , the attorney , furthermore urged jurors not to let the sad , gruesome nature of the crash and its effect on its victims cloud their determination as to whether @entity11 's texting was to blame			1
" please do n't listen to the sympathies of the commonwealth when you 're making your decision , " @entity110 said .			0

the trial of @entity11 , now 18 , began this week in @entity12 , @entity2
authorities say he was texting before a fatal crash , then erased some of the texts
the defense argues authorities had an agenda in trying to link texting with the crash
the teen had told police after the *incident* , " i was tired , i was distracted "
