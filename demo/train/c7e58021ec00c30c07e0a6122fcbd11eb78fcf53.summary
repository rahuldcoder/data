@entity1 , @entity0 -- a group of @entity5 scientists last week called on rich nations to help stem the tide of @entity5 talent leaving the continent 's universities			0
dr. @entity11 , who runs a clinic in rural @entity13 , wanted to update her knowledge of tropical medicine			0
in a statement the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) urged developed nations to establish training programs that would allow @entity5 research students to stay in @entity5 or study in other developing countries			0
one program that may prove key to curbing the flight of the skilled health professionals from the developing world is the distance learning course at the @entity29 's @entity28			1
the school , a world leader in global health education and research started the course to allow health professionals to enhance their skills and knowledge at their own pace and in their own country			1
dr. @entity11 , a physician in rural @entity13 , earned a diploma through the distance learning course offered			1
dr. @entity11 directs a clinic in @entity43 , a rural area in central @entity13 where nurses and health services are in short supply			0
she wanted a refresher on tropical medicine and also hopes the additional training will help her gain entry into the world of government			0
" i want to improve my country and go into politics to influence policy making when it comes to health matters , " she told @entity2			0
some 2,500 students are enrolled in the @entity1 school 's distance learning program , which offers master 's degrees and graduate diplomas in infectious diseases , public health and clinical trials			1
" we do n't train people for the brain drain			1
we train people very much to make a contribution to their own countries , " said @entity68 , the director of the @entity28			0
a complex set of factors contribute to brain drain , and while it 's too early to say that distance learning has had an impact on the trend , @entity68 believes it can make a contribution to retaining people in their home countries			1
" when i speak to distance learning students , many of them say this has opened up an opportunity that otherwise would n't have come to them -- to stay in their own countries and at the same time access teaching materials of an international quality , " he said			1
the program offers a flexibility that meets the wide range of needs of learners these days , providing access to specialized training to those who can not leave their home country due to financial constraints or professional commitments			2
a sign of the course 's popularity : nearly three times as many students participate in the distance program than actually come to study at the school in @entity1			2
the program also is getting a boost from the @entity107 , which awarded the @entity28 a $ 1 million prize for excellence in global health this year			1
the @entity111 for @entity112 , which is awarded annually to an organization that makes exceptional contributions to international health , will be used partly to developing new courses , providing scholarships and offering support for distance learning students			1
distance education is by no means novel , but instructors say the @entity28 program is particularly enhanced for students in the developing world and unique in its international audience			1
students from around the world participate in the program , with roughly 40 percent of students based in countries in @entity5 and a good proportion in @entity133 , said @entity134 , the dean of studies			2
while internet access has improved considerably since the distance learning program began in 1998 , many students enrolled in the program still live in areas where bandwidth is poor and connections are slow			1
" one of our biggest challenges is trying to deliver something that is still accessible and suitable to a student who is sitting somewhere that 's got very poor internet access but also is suitable for a student sitting somewhere who 's got every gadget and high - speed bandwidth available to them , " @entity134 said			0
at the core of the program are self - study materials which students follow at their own pace			2
these materials are complemented with electronic mechanisms like web chat boards that allow students to interact with each other and tutors			0
dr. @entity11 hopes that as well as distance learning programs , governments will encourage more doctors to practice in rural areas to improve public services			2
" there are not enough nurses and ambulance services , " she said about the region where she works			0
" the government needs to push more doctors to rural areas			0
the hospitals -- they will not run themselves			0

distance learning widens access to world - class health training and education
