@entity0 -- the @entity3 hot dog - eating contest has always separated the men from the boys , as far as eating competitions go , but this year it will separate the men from the women -- with separate challenges for the sexes			2
@entity11 , chairman of the annual event 's sponsor , @entity14 , says that with more women competing , it was the right decision to make			2
" there was a feeling that what woman have done is nothing short of fantastic , but they were being overshadowed by the men , " @entity11 said			2
as @entity3 readies for its 96th annual july @entity24 on @entity25 , the ladies will go first in vying for their own championship belt			2
the women 's competition will abide by the same rules , with at least 10 female contestants required to eat as many hot dogs and buns as they can in 10 minutes			1
qualifying events for the contest begin april 23 and will be held in 13 cities including @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity0 and @entity41			0
events will also be held in @entity42 and @entity43 to qualify for the july 4 contest			0
although the men 's competition will feature a grand prize of $ 20,000 and the famous championship belt , the woman 's purse will be $ 5,000			1
why the disparity ? @entity11 says that the overall prize money will eclipse that of past years and that although the money is meaningful , the instant celebrity for the first female hot dog - eating champion will make up for the shortfall			0
in 2010 , reigning champion @entity58 took home the championship belt for the fourth year in a row after scarfing down 54 hot dogs and buns , although he 'd eaten a record 68 dogs in 2009			1
the leading female contender for this year 's event is @entity67 , who downed 36 hot dogs in the co-ed 2010 contest , falling short of her personal best of 41 hot dogs in 2009			1
a strong challenger will probably be 45 - year - old @entity73 from @entity74 , @entity75			0
@entity76 , who owns a hair salon , is " excited " and hopes to best her personal record of 34 hot dogs , which she accomplished a year ago			1
@entity76 , who weighs 100 pounds , says she 's participating " not for the money but because it 's a passion			0
" she prefers seafood , she says			0
@entity85 tourist @entity84 broke the @entity87 's gender barrier in 1984 as the first female competitor , downing 11 hot dogs and buns			1
@entity14 is launching a global effort to find @entity84 and have her come back to @entity25 this year .			0

the first woman to compete was a @entity85 tourist , in 1984
@entity67 is a leading contender this year
in the 2010 championship , she downed 36 dogs
this year 's top male eater will get $ 20,000 , but top woman will get $ 5,000
