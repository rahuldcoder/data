for architecture buffs numbed by the ongoing global battle to crank out record - breaking tall buildings , here 's something innovative to spark the imagination			0
the @entity7 government has granted approval to begin construction on the world 's first " invisible " tower			1
designed by @entity14 - based @entity13 , the glass - encased @entity12 will top out at 450 meters ( 1,476 feet ) and have the third highest observation deck in the world			1
the project is backed by @entity18 , a state - owned land and public housing developer			0
the invisibility illusion will be achieved with a high - tech led facade system that uses a series of cameras that will send real - time images onto the building 's reflective surface			1
it will be built just outside of @entity29 near the @entity30			1
neither the developer nor @entity13 have released a target completion date			0
the development will reportedly be used primarily for leisure activities			0
it will include a series of observation decks , a movie theater , roller coaster , water park and numerous food and beverage outlets			0
though height is n't its main selling point , @entity12 is no slouch in the vertical department			1
when completed , it 's expected to come in sixth on the list of the world 's highest towers , behind @entity50 , @entity52 's @entity51 , @entity54 's @entity53 , @entity56 's @entity55 and @entity58 's @entity57			1
editor 's note : the original version of this paragraph said @entity12 would be one of the world 's tallest buildings , not towers			1
the error has been corrected			0
more : 13 scary - but - awesome viewing platforms how it works @entity12 's invisible face is essentially just @entity72 camouflage			1
cameras will be placed at three different heights on six different sides of the building to capture real - time images of the surroundings ; three other sections , each filled with 500 rows of @entity83 screens , will project the individual digital images			2
through digital processing , images will be scaled , rotated and merged to create a seamless panoramic image that appears on the led rows to create the illusion of invisibility			2
in essence , whatever is going on behind the building will be projected onto the front of the building			0
according to @entity13 , managers will be able to alter the level of power used to give the building different levels of invisibility			0
" instead of symbolizing prominence as another of the world 's tallest and best towers , our solution aims to provide the world 's first invisible tower , showcasing innovative @entity7 technology while encouraging a more global narrative in the process , " said @entity99 , @entity13 design principal , in a statement			2
in 2011 @entity13 , in collaboration with firms @entity111 and @entity112 , was awarded first prize in a @entity116 sponsored by the @entity117 to provide design and engineering services for the observation tower			0
