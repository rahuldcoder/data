-- if you 've got a question about buying a camera , shooting out a quick note to the retailer on @entity6 might help			1
but if you 're in the market for a silky camisole ? maybe not			0
that 's according to a survey of 20 top online retailers on @entity6 that suggests their level of responsiveness to customers is uneven , at best			1
one out of four companies failed to respond to a customer - service question posted on their @entity6 wall , and even fewer replied to questions asked as comments on their posts , reported @entity22 , a company that rates customer service among online businesses			1
the results of the survey of 20 leading retailers , conducted on february 29 , come at a time when almost every company that deals with the public is trying to tap into the more than 850 million people who use the social - networking site			0
" brands are doing an enthusiastic job of bringing people to their pages , " said @entity34 , @entity22 's co-founder			0
" [ but ] i do n't think they 're also necessarily bringing with them a desire to be social			0
it 's just turning into a marketing message for many companies			0
" leading the pack was @entity46			0
the @entity48 - based outlet , which claims to be the largest nonchain camera store in the world , responded to its wall post in about two minutes , according to the report , which was shared with @entity53 @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 all responded to posts within 30 minutes			1
on the opposite end of the spectrum , @entity59 , your best bet for the aforementioned camisole , was one of five companies that did n't respond to a wall post within two days			1
one @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 were the others			0
" retailers need to realize that two days in @entity6 time is like two years in real time , " @entity34 said			1
" customer questions on @entity6 should be granted the same urgency as a phone call			1
" @entity34 noted , however , that the survey was n't meant to embarrass companies or suggest that some of them do n't care about their customers			2
instead , he said , it was an effort to start setting expectations for an area of marketing and customer service that remains relatively unexplored			1
" i do n't think we as customers really know what to expect yet if you post a message , " he said			0
" do you expect them to get back in 10 minutes or two hours ? or , a day -- is that alright ? we 're trying to develop the standard , or at least identify what the averages are for certain categories			1
" among the companies that responded to questions during the survey , the average was under an hour , he said			2
the posts were what @entity34 called generic product questions : " do you guys have this in a particular color i do n't see ? what 's the return policy for this particular item ... ? that looks really cool , do you have this in whatever size ? " while 25 % of retailers did n't respond to wall posts , that number rocketed to 65 percent for comments on other posts			1
eight companies deleted the questions that were posted on their walls , whether they answered the question or not			2
five companies out of 20 -- @entity46 , @entity127 , @entity54 , @entity128 and @entity55 -- responded to wall posts and comments and had not deleted those questions within 48 hours			2
only six of the 20 companies listed on their @entity6 pages an e-mail address or phone number by which customers could contact them , the report showed			2
" you ca n't just be there halfway with marketing , " @entity34 said			0
" if you 're going to be part of the community , be part of the community			0
