-- in most places , when 16 people are gunned down , the local media reports the incident without missing a beat			0
but when the massacre described above happened last weekend in @entity10 , @entity11 , the editors of the city 's largest daily newspaper had to have a long discussion before deciding to cover and investigate the story			1
as drug cartel violence continues unabated throughout @entity11 , journalists find themselves walking a thin line between covering the story and becoming part of it			1
already this year , three journalists have been killed in @entity11 , reaffirming the country 's place as one of the most dangerous in the world for journalists			1
the drug violence " generates fear , even if you do n't like to admit it , " @entity26 , deputy editor of @entity27 told @entity0			1
drug cartels have targeted reporters and editors who report on their activities , something that gives editors pause before reporting on incidents likely linked to the cartels			1
after discussion , the @entity10 newspaper decided to investigate the gruesome slayings that happened over the weekend , but are aware of what that means			1
" we are always trying to investigate , but when you get too deep you draw a reaction , " @entity26 said , referring to threats from drug traffickers			1
" in this case , we are trying to dig as deep as possible			0
" however , if the paper 's efforts are met with " reactions , " they will have to back down , he said			0
it is a form of self - censorship that many media outlets in @entity11 have accepted out of concern for the safety of their staffs			1
sometimes , cartel members will call the newspaper to try to get reporters to not write about certain incidents ; other times they push for certain stories to be included			1
" there 's pressure from all sides , " @entity26 said			1
in january , a crime reporter for the @entity74 newspaper in @entity75 , @entity11 -- @entity76 -- was kidnapped			1
he was found dead shortly after , his body showing signs of torture and with several bullet wounds			0
. according to the @entity81 , @entity76 was found with a message that read : " this is going to happen to those who do n't understand			2
the message is for everyone			0
" less than two weeks later , authorities in the state of @entity89 found the body of another journalist who was kidnapped in december			0
@entity93 's body also showed signs of torture , @entity81 reported			0
the most recent victim was @entity97 , a @entity11 editor and publisher of two papers in the western state of @entity101 who died last week after being shot in the face , according to local media			1
the state attorney general 's office told @entity0 wednesday that there were two leads in the investigation , but that authorities were not ready to talk about them publicly yet			0
" obviously , for this year , it 's already an alarming figure , " @entity111 , press freedom manager for the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 , told @entity0			0
" there appears to be no end in sight			0
" " although journalists continue bravely to do their jobs , the fact of the matter is that the systematic killing of journalists is going to have an effect on the job that journalists do , " @entity119 added			2
compounding the problem , @entity119 said , is either the inability or unwillingness of @entity11 authorities to investigate violence against journalists			1
the @entity10 paper had a reporter killed in 2008			2
federal and local authorities visited the newspaper office and vowed to bring the killers to justice , " but in the end , nothing happens , " @entity26 said			0
the case of the @entity10 reporter , @entity145 , remains unsolved			0
@entity146 , editor - in - chief of @entity148 newspaper in @entity149 , @entity11 , across the border from @entity151 , @entity152 , said excessive caution has become the norm for reporting crime			1
" i do n't want heroes here at my newspaper because it could be dangerous , " @entity146 told @entity0			2
" we are reporters , we are not police			0
" @entity149 has not seen as much violence as other border cities , but it is the home of the @entity163 cartel			2
out of an abundance of caution , @entity146 's newspaper reports only on incidents that the police department gives news conferences or press releases about			2
@entity146 said journalists are just the messengers who are getting caught in the middle of a conflict that is international in scope			2
@entity11 , as a transport country for drugs , and the @entity179 , as a consumer of drugs , have to work together to resolve the trafficking problem before journalists and others can be safe , he said			1
in the meantime , " there is no security , no guarantees			0
" despite the challenges and dangerous environment , @entity26 , the editor in @entity10 , remains hopeful			0
" our goal is to return to doing the type of journalism we were doing two years ago , " before the violence there escalated , he said .			0

three @entity11 journalists have been killed so far in 2010
says one editor : drug violence " generates fear , even if you do n't like to admit it "
news *groups* must be cautious when investigating slayings linked to drug cartels
journalists say cartels pressure them to drop some stories , cover others
