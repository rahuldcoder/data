-- " take deep breaths , " i tell my son			1
the irony of the instruction is n't lost on me after he begins to explain why he is so upset			1
it 's the end of a long day -- dark way before i think it should be , as the cold has n't quite taken full hold in @entity11			1
i got the text from dr. @entity13 just before 3 p.m. once my abnormal psychology professor , now a super colleague in the department , her message read , " no indictment ... disbelieving			2
" but i had come to terms with this injustice visited on @entity21 and the rest of us -- at least in my mind			1
i 'd compartmentalized things since the week before with the no - indictment in @entity27 , @entity28			2
i clinically went about lecturing and working with my students from @entity30 and @entity31 in thinking through their protest of solidarity with @entity27 and the epidemic extrajudicial killings of black folks			1
they began their " make it matter " protest last tuesday at the foot of the martin luther king statue on @entity31 's campus and moved on to @entity42 a few miles away			2
i 'd brought my kid to work that day			2
and this is when i would begin a focused dialogue with him , in 7 - year - old - speak , about the situation in @entity27 , @entity50 and issues of race and social justice			1
the little guy took it just fine , asked a few questions for clarity and then concluded , " but if a police officer is supposed to protect the people and then he shoots a teenager because he 's afraid of him , even though the teenager does n't have a gun , then [ the police officer ] 's a brute			1
and since then , i 've talked with , taught and consoled students on campus , reflecting on the tumult i experienced some 22 years prior in the aftermath of the police beating of @entity70			1
@entity21 's killing is an amped - up , 21st - century manifestation of that violence with an echo of past @entity76 cases like those of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
still , i 've resisted putting it all together			1
@entity82 explained it to me so well last month with his essay " without @entity85			2
" but then my son , voice quivering after the long day , said , " i 've been thinking about the problems in the world			1
i knew he was too cool about this last week			2
" and @entity91 , and people do n't like other people because of their skin , " he continues , before collapsing between the front and back seat , sobbing into my arms			0
" breathe , " i say , using every ounce of physical strength i have not to cry with him			0
he does n't even know about the failure to indict officer @entity103 in @entity76 on tuesday			0
" the world is better already because of people like you , " i say as i begin to re-frame the conversation			0
" you know what 's right and what 's wrong , and so do the students that you met last week			1
and we 're all going to be kind to one another , study and figure how to make it better			0
" i sounded very convincing , as parents are supposed to			0
the academic year started with the police killings of @entity50 and @entity21 , and the semester ends with the decision that these were somehow legal			1
this weighs heavy for so many			0
in the bubble we build at @entity31 we hold up young black men			0
we work to show them the best parts of who they are , making conspicuous a humanity that the body politic refuses to see as the norm			0
that 's the core of the work that we do			0
but it 's a hard sell when the young people you reason with note that you can be shot to death in broad daylight , or choked to death on camera because white folks are scared of you			0
still , the truth is that black men and women and black kids -- girls and boys -- are not disposable			0
of course , this is as much a mantra for me as it is instruction to my boy			0
breathe , and then let 's continue to do the work .			0
