@entity0 -- an audience of millions watched @entity3 drop a verbal bomb when she uttered the f - word on an awards show			1
@entity7 said it , too , a year later , and @entity8 uttered it and s -- t in the same sentence			1
@entity13 @entity7 appears at the 2003 @entity14 on @entity15 , where he uttered a " fleeting expletive			1
" because the celebrities made their remarks on live television , the @entity18 levied heavy fines on the broadcast networks			1
now the @entity24 will weigh in on the " isolated " use of such words -- politely referred to as " fleeting expletives " -- and the power of government to clamp down on what it sees as pervasive indecent language on the public airwaves			1
arguments in the free speech case are tuesday			1
" make no mistake what this is about , " said @entity36 , who heads the @entity37 and is supporting the @entity18 efforts			0
" the networks are suing for the right to use the f - word in front of children during prime - time broadcast television			1
" but @entity48 , president of the @entity49 , had a different view			0
" the crux of this case is whether the inconsistent way the @entity18 has regulated indecent speech gives writers , producers , and directors , as well as television broadcasters , clear guidelines for them to comply , " said @entity48 , whose group has filed legal briefs on behalf of the creative forces that provide programming for the networks			1
the controversial words have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the - air networks in the past six years , when federal regulators began considering a stronger , no - tolerance policy			1
@entity69 , @entity15 , @entity70 and @entity71 are parties in the case			2
a federal appeals court in @entity75 last year ruled in their favor , calling the @entity18 's policy " arbitrary and capricious			0
" the commission then appealed to the @entity24 , seeking restoration of its power to penalize the networks airing " indecent " speech , even if it is broadcast only once , and even if it does not describe a specific sex act			1
such language is seen with greater , albeit varying , frequency on cable television , the @entity88 and satellite radio , which do not use public airwaves			1
but the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints when " indecent " language reaches television television and radio , which is subject to greater regulation			1
that is especially relevant during daytime and early evening , when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching			0
the @entity18 formally reversed its policy in march 2004 to declare that even a single use of an expletive could be illegal			0
commission members noted , " given the core meaning of the ' @entity107 , ' any use of that word or a variation , in any context , inherently has a sexual connotation			0
the ' @entity107 ' is one of the most vulgar , graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the @entity117 language			2
its use invariably invokes a coarse sexual image			0
" the changes became known as the " @entity121 , " for singer @entity7 's 2003 acceptance speech at the awards show on @entity15 , where he uttered the phrase " really , really , f --- ing brilliant			1
" the commission specifically cited celebrities @entity3 and @entity129 's potty - mouth language during the 2002 and 2003 @entity130 , which aired on @entity69			1
@entity129 , in an apparently scripted moment said , " have you ever tried to get cow s -- t out of a @entity135 purse ? it 's not so f --- ing simple			0
" the complaint against @entity70 involved " @entity142 , " a now - canceled scripted police drama , and the one against @entity71 involved " @entity139 , " a news and interview program			0
enforcement of the law , as well as fines and sanctions for the incidents , have been put on hold while the case is being argued			2
the appeals court ruling said the @entity18 did not adequately explain amendments to and enforcement of its " vague " policy on broadcasts of profanity			0
but after the ruling , @entity157 , an @entity18 commissioner , warned that " any broadcaster who sees this decision as a green light to send more gratuitous sex and violence into our homes would be making a huge mistake			0
" the @entity24 first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978 , when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian @entity170 , on society 's taboo surrounding " seven dirty words			1
" the bit had received some radio airplay			0
the author of that narrow opinion , justice @entity178 , still sits on the high court			0
he famously defined " indecent " speech as any depiction or description of " sexual or excretory activities or organs " in a manner that is deemed " patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium			1
" the now - 88 - year - old justice steered clear of a philosophical discourse on the @entity190 at the time , choosing instead to focus on the practical effect of suppressing " dirty " speech : protecting young children who might be watching or listening the broadcast television networks say their scripted shows no longer have expletives , even after 10 p.m. , when some potentially vulgar words are permitted			1
their worry is the unplanned , often spontaneous use of an indecent or profane word at live events , like awards shows and sporting events			2
@entity206 officials say such programs are often on a five - second delay , and censors are on hand to bleep any offensive language			2
but some indecent words can slip through , they admit			1
" this past summer , @entity71 edited into a show that had to go through multiple reviews , by multiple people in the organization , the f - word , " said @entity36 , whose group advocates " responsible " programming			0
the show in question was " @entity224 10 , " a taped series			0
broadcasters argue they are uncertain about which words are banned , and in what context			2
they say " s --- t " is forbidden under @entity18 rules , but not " poop " or " crap , " even though all those words are crude references to excrement			2
the appeals court noted the government does not punish every " indecent " reference on the air , citing the r - rated " @entity243 , " an @entity245 - winning 1998 movie that is filled with realistic , often coarse language from soldiers			1
the film has been aired repeatedly on the networks , but the @entity18 said such profanity was not intended to shock or titillate , but rather to " convey the horrors of war			2
" in a separate incident , over nudity , a federal appeals court in june ruled in favor of @entity71 , which aired singer @entity260 's " wardrobe malfunction " -- when her breast was briefly revealed -- at the @entity258 halftime show			0
the @entity18 imposed an indecency fine of $ 550,000			0
an appeal to the high court is possible			0
@entity265 , parent company of @entity1 , filed an amicus brief supporting the networks fined by the @entity18			2
the company is part owner of the @entity271 broadcast network , and also operates several cable networks			2
broadcasters and producers say that while there is no substitute for responsible parenting , the current social and political environment makes it difficult for them to do their jobs			0
" trying to produce material that is artistically superior is extremely difficult , " says @entity48 , " in a context where somebody with a clipboard is running around saying , ' well maybe this word is ok , maybe this word is n't ok , ca n't you change this			0
' " lawyers from both sides expect tuesday 's oral arguments to be filled with the " indecent " language at issue , so expect to see a lot of f - bombs being tossed around by the justices , all in the name of legal clarity , of course			1
the case is @entity18 v. @entity302 ( 07 - 582 ) .			0

the government aims to clamp down on indecent language on the public airwaves
