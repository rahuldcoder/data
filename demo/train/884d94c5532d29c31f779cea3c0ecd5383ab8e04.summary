-- when i was in seventh grade , my grandmother informed our extended family that i was a pervert			2
mind you , i was as squeaky clean in thought and deed as you 'd expect a badly permed , brace - faced , catholic school spelling bee winner would be , but that did n't mean i was n't curious about a few things			2
i 'd often give my bedroom over to visiting relatives , and this time , my grandmother had decided on a little light reading -- in this case , my copy of @entity18 's " @entity12			1
" it might seem downright quaint in this age of instantly accessible porn and e-book readers , but an awful lot of ladies who came of age in the ' 70s and ' 80s and into the ' 90s got a significant chunk of our sex education from young adult books			1
more specifically , they were paperback books with cracked spines , decoy paper covers and pages dog - eared at the juicy bits			1
these were n't even necessarily acts of depraved , wildebeestly humping and sexytime ( @entity41 novels aside ) but rather some thoroughly non-judgmental plot points about the gross , weird , lusty wonder of puberty and adolescence			1
in the @entity49 era , it was nearly impossible to just sidle into the local bookstore or library and nab one without fear of being branded a slut or a skank -- labels that both intrigued and confused us , and which we hurled with ignorant abandon			2
we relied on someone 's cool aunt , older sister or slightly oblivious mom to get the goods and coordinated their circulation with military precision : " ok , @entity65 gets ' @entity66 ' tonight , and she 'll hand off ' forever ' to @entity68 , who will give ' up in @entity70 ' to @entity71 " @entity72 was the girl who got caught flipping through the contraband in class , though			2
all blame and shame was on her , and it was understood that she 'd have to get another copy into rotation			2
because we were starving then , aching for information and affirmation that the feelings and odd body hairs were nothing out of the ordinary			2
ordinary is all we wanted to be			2
a brief history of young adult literature @entity18 's @entity88 taught us the musts of bust expansion exercises and menstruation , while @entity92 explored her " special place " during shower time			1
( confession : it was years before i realized she was talking about masturbation , and i thought she had a ticklish spot in her underarm like i did			2
) @entity18 's @entity103 ( of the grandma - scandalizing " then again ... " ) had his first wet dreams and found increasingly baroque ways to hide his boners , and the much - banned virginity - busting " forever " gave a generation of women a reason to giggle every time they met a man named @entity113			1
though @entity18 was the captain of the genre , plenty of other authors chummed the waters of teen girls ' curiosity about sex , often bumping up against boundaries of shame and fear			1
we were grateful to have those maps			2
for me , that book that broke through was @entity128 's " @entity129 is a @entity130 , " the sequel to her classic " @entity132			2
" by eighth grade , i was roughly aware of the mechanics of the act , thanks to a bare - bones and thoroughly grudging syllabus laid out by my local @entity140 diocese , teaching essentially : do n't , and shame on you for even thinking about it without a wedding ring on your finger			0
it was a relief and a revelation to see @entity150 's protagonist , @entity149 , echo that struggle			0
she met a handsome young @entity153 , thought for a hot second about the preachers who 'd made her feel like a filthy sinner all her untouched life and opted for pleasure over guilt			1
though it would be some years until i came to that particular crossroads in my own life , having sex celebrated , rather than demonized , by an author i 'd come to trust was tremendously freeing			1
@entity168 - based writer @entity167 found a guidepost in " @entity172 , " the " anonymous diary " of a drug - addicted runaway ( later revealed to be the fictional work of novelist @entity171 ) , and veered from the course			1
" i grew up in a family that did n't talk about sex			1
ever , " @entity167 wrote in an e-mail			0
" everything i learned about boys and sex , i learned from my older girl cousins , friends , friends ' moms , and books			1
" one sunday morning in sixth grade , @entity167 swiped her older cousin 's copy of the book after hearing her go on and on about how cool it was			0
" the drug stuff was way over my head			0
did n't bother me , did n't scare me			0
the sex parts were totally intriguing , because she seemed so disconnected to it all			1
@entity198 ' around that same time , where it was all about @entity200 and @entity202 's love , the main character in ' @entity172 ' seemed a little more like me -- weird , immature , not the kind of girl boys were interested in , " @entity167 wrote			0
" it made me think that sex was , at some point , something i was going to do -- just to get it over with to see what it was like , and then decide if i was ever going to have it again or just be done with it			1
that it would be that easy to be disconnected from emotion			0
" i 'm glad i was wrong , " @entity167 concluded			0
the new names on the banned book list and for all the care and caution of @entity18 , @entity150 and even " @entity221 , " there was the lurid , creepy abandon of @entity41 ' 1979 " @entity222			1
" there 's no polite way to describe the plot , so i 'll just rip off the bandage			0
for various complicated reasons , four siblings ( two older and two younger ) are kept locked in an attic by their wealthy , sadistic grandmother , who slowly poisons them with arsenic - powdered doughnuts			0
the two eldest eventually do what a healthy , normal , well - adjusted brother and sister would never even dream of doing : they begin a sexual relationship			0
yes , it 's as disturbing as it sounds , an icky emulsion of lust , taboo , sexual violence and moral fervor			0
it 's also sold more than 40 million copies worldwide and spawned multiple sequels , a theatrical release and a made - for - television version that will air on the @entity251 network on saturday			1
it was the single hottest ticket on the underground book swap when i was a freshman in high school			0
we were not alone in this ; many smart explorations have been made on the topic of " @entity259 ' " intense appeal to adolescent girls ( though it was never strictly marketed to them )			0
but if i had to venture a guess , i 'd say it 's the one - two whammy of hormones and horror			0
first , the overheated soap - opera plotting gave otherwise shy , book - loving girls an excuse to to talk to one another on a " literary " level ( eventually getting down to the nitty gritty ) and bond in a way they might never over " @entity275			0
" second , and perhaps even more significant , is the sharp relief into which it threw any real - life palpitations they might be experiencing			0
made out with your lab partner under the bleachers or wondering if over-the - sweater is a base too far ? at least you 're not sleeping with your brother			0
@entity287 - based author @entity286 found the descriptions of the couplings so disturbing , she admits it might have caused her to hang on to her virginity than she might have otherwise			1
the phrase from the novel that @entity286 said was " quite the bucket of cold water on my teenage ardor " is ( ahem ) : " it drove into my tight resisting flesh , which tore and bled			0
" in a written exchange , she admitted to some confusion , saying she " initially thought ( for some reason ) that it was her thigh flesh that tore and bled ... but then i realized what it really meant			0
either way , it made sex seem scary and painful and while i knew i was n't going to get raped by a brother while living in an attic surrounded by tempting arsenic - laced doughnuts , i carried with me the belief that sex ( when it happened ) was bound to be painful			1
" painful or not , because of these battered , dog - eared , passed - around volumes , none of us had to go through the mess of adolescence solo			0
we had @entity88 , @entity66 , @entity149 , @entity103 , @entity221 and even ol ' @entity113 alongside us to make us feel a little more normal in a hormone - frenzied world			1
and i find these days , reminiscing with women my age , that i have an urge to reunite with these fictional friends again			1
which @entity328 books were you reading while nobody was looking ? share your memories in the comments , on @entity332 or on @entity333 @ @entity334 !			1

for *people* of some generations , sex ed came from young adult literature
books by @entity18 and @entity41 can still make grown women blush
a film based on @entity41 ' " @entity222 " debuts on @entity251 on saturday
