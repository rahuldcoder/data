-- the long - anticipated @entity2 smartwatch became a reality this week when the tech giant unveiled its entry into the growing wearable - tech field			1
the @entity7 , which comes in three styles and two sizes with multiple options for colors and wristbands , was expected to energize a market that 's been slow to catch on as smartwatches from competitors such as @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 rolled out over the past two years			1
more than just a tiny smartphone , the @entity7 , which hits the market early next year , packs a ton of watch - specific features			0
it has a " crown " knob to control scrolling and zoom without having to touch the screen , silent pulse notifications , a slate of health and fitness apps and compatibility with @entity2 's new @entity34 app , which lets users scan and pay card - free at participating stores			1
but there are also questions			0
the company is still mum on many of the device 's specifications , including memory , screen resolution and -- most crucially -- battery life			2
the exact differences between the low - , middle - and high - end watches are also still blurry			0
the watch must be tethered to an @entity50 -- some observers had hoped for a standalone device -- and its $ 350 price tag is more than many were expecting			2
so did the company do enough to make @entity7 a breakthrough device that will shake up the gadget market the way its @entity59 , @entity50 and @entity60 did ? many analysts said they think so			2
" @entity64 defines the category in ways that other competitors will now have to work furiously to catch up to , " said @entity62 , a tech analyst at @entity63			1
" in classic @entity2 style , the company has introduced a new interface -- the digital crown along with a tap and touch capable surface -- that will make @entity2 's watch experience significantly easier to use than anybody else 's			1
" while many competitors have released a single smartwatch , sometimes in designs that have been panned for being bulky and unfashionable , @entity2 's trademark attention to design could make a difference , said @entity83 , chief researcher at @entity84			1
that 's true , she said , even if the features @entity2 showcased wo n't come close to making a smartphone unnecessary			1
" i do think smartwatches are still a nice - to - have versus a must - have -- more a convenience than a necessity , which is why appealing more from a style perspective might win more users in the short term , " she said			1
whether that pushes competitors in the same direction remains to be seen			0
" longer term i think we need to wait and see , " @entity83 said			0
" i am not sure we are totally clear as to what the true role of these wearable devices really is , especially as the @entity103 materializes			0
" @entity63 's @entity104 said he 's convinced that @entity7 will push smartwatches into the mainstream in a way that devices running @entity110 's @entity109 have n't managed			0
" @entity2 will legitimize and create the mass - market wearables category , " he said			1
@entity62 said he does n't expect the @entity2 watch to catch on with consumers as quickly as the @entity60 , which first introduced most people to the concept of a tablet computer			1
he noted how @entity2 ceo @entity117 repeatedly referred to the device as a " personal " device and said that could be the key to wide appeal			1
from design to health monitoring to the @entity34 feature , the watch could become a seamless piece of people 's day - to - day lives , not a mere novelty , he said			0
" as a longtime @entity19 watch wearer , i can attest to the number of ways a watch , because of its glanceability and its one - touch efficiency , helps you get things done more quickly than before , causing you to do them even more , " he said			0
but what about the people who just do n't wear watches , or those who have found , in a smartphone , a suitable replacement ? @entity83 said there 's a chance that even those consumers will come on board			0
after all , who thought they wanted a tablet computer before @entity2 showcased the @entity60 ? " there are users that never wore a watch who happily spent money on a fitness band , so i do not see why not , " @entity83 said			0
" is it for everyone ? no , of course not			0
but there is a market out there , especially of @entity2 users who see the benefits of having multiple @entity2 devices working together			2
" @entity2 watch : start of a wearable revolution ?			2
