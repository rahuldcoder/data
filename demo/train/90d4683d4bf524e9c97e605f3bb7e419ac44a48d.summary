-- the selfie pandemic -- the cultural ebola of our networked age -- is going global			1
it 's bad enough that we 've had the selfie as the word - of - year , the selfie as a " brilliant and terrible " tv show , the smiling selfie at @entity10 , the selfie with a suicide as its backdrop and the selfie proudly blocking @entity16 's most masterful self - portrait			1
but that 's just the beginning of this digital disease			2
now the selfie has turned its narcissistic gaze upon @entity23			1
the selfie has gone on the @entity25 and has turned up at the @entity26 , the cube - shaped black stone building in @entity28 that is the holiest place in the @entity23 faith			1
@entity25 2014 is " the @entity30 " -- and @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 are all abuzz with digital self - portraits of pilgrims who , to fulfill one of the five pillars of faith in the @entity23 tradition , have gone to @entity28			1
" @entity47 # selfie # hajj # @entity28 , " wrote @ dan_a_lowe on @entity32 as he posed , @entity42 - @entity41 - style , in front of a group of smiling fellow @entity45			1
but , of course , not all @entity48 are selfie enthusiasts -- even if camera phones are no longer strictly banned at the @entity26			1
although one pilgrim described the selfie craze as an " endemic not easy to stop , " some clerics are doing their best to remind @entity48 that digital self - portraits in front of the @entity26 are an insult to the @entity57			1
" say no to @entity58 ! " thus implores the @entity59			2
" @entity62 , i ask of you a pilgrimage that contains no boasting or showing off , " adds @entity61 - based scholar @entity60			1
" taking such selfies and videos defy the wish of our prophet			0
" " the hajj is all about overcoming your " self " ! " reminds @ yshirin on @entity32			0
" # hajjselfie wont bring anyone anyhere ( sic )			0
" so is anything sacred anymore ? yes			0
in our networked the age , the sacred -- like everything else -- is being reinvented			0
what @entity25 2014 , " the @entity30 , " represents is the democratization of the sacred			1
in traditional religion , unique places like the black stone @entity26 or the @entity85 in @entity86 represented the sacred			0
but in our age of digital narcissism , it 's the familiar which is made most sacred and we imagine ourselves as the center of the universe			0
@entity92 explains the selfie pandemic of placing ourselves in the middle of every photograph			2
everything -- or at least everything about us -- is now sacred			0
the sacred has been turned on its head in a world where tech has allowed narcissism to run riot			0
in our selfie - culture , we now thinks of the world as revolving around us			2
so all the hundreds of billions of images we snap -- from @entity10 to the @entity26 -- comes with a personalized signature			0
the sacred has been de-mythologized			0
it now exists in several billion different colors and flavors			0
so should we expect similar selfie pandemics in the world 's other major monotheistic creeds ? unfortunately , that 's already happening			2
back in august last year , @entity115 authored the first papal selfie			1
" make the future with beauty , with goodness and truth , " @entity115 told some of the kids who posed with him			2
" and " make noise " is exactly what we are all doing in our technology - fuelled age of digital narcissism			2
from @entity28 to @entity130 , we are all making as much noise about ourselves on @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity34 as we can			1
traditional monotheistic creeds were all about overcoming ourselves			0
but our selfie - centric culture is the reverse ; today , @entity23 pilgrims are turning the @entity25 into an epic selfie			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .			0

the @entity25 , one of the five pillars of @entity23 , is the annual pilgrimage to @entity28 in @entity143
@entity23 requires every *muslim* who is *physically* and *financially* able to make the *journey* once
@entity25 2014 has been *dubbed* " the year of the selfie " and has drawn *criticism* from clerics
