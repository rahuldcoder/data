@entity0 -- the push to overhaul health care received a major boost thursday as the @entity5 and @entity7 endorsed legislation drafted by top @entity8			1
the @entity7 , the nation 's largest organization of older @entity10 , is a nonpartisan group that advocates for people 50 and older			1
the @entity5 , historically an opponent of health care reform , is considered one the nation 's most influential doctors ' advocacy groups			2
" i want to thank both organizations again for their support , and i urge @entity21 to listen to @entity7 , listen to the @entity5 and pass this reform for hundreds of millions of @entity10 who will benefit from it , " president @entity17 said at the @entity18			1
the backing of those two groups comes as house speaker @entity27 , @entity28 , oversees final changes to the $ 1.1 trillion health care bill			1
the measure likely will come to a final vote saturday			0
read the @entity18 health care bill ( @entity34 ) a 42 - page manager 's amendment on the health care legislation posted tuesday night made mostly technical changes in the nearly 2,000 - page bill compiled from three @entity41 proposals passed by three @entity18 committees			1
by making the changes public tuesday , @entity18 @entity41 leaders could open floor debate on the bill friday , while fulfilling their pledge to allow 72 hours of review before bringing the measure to the full chamber			1
@entity27 insisted thursday she will have the 218 votes necessary to pass the bill			1
meanwhile , president @entity17 is set to huddle saturday with congressional @entity8 on @entity54 to review the legislation			1
check out the key parts of the bill in a statement , @entity7 ceo @entity58 said , " we started this debate more than two years ago with the twin goals of making coverage affordable to our younger members and protecting @entity65 for seniors			1
" we can say with confidence that [ the @entity18 bill ] meets those goals with improved benefits for people in @entity65 and needed health insurance market reforms to help ensure every @entity10 can purchase affordable health coverage			1
" the @entity5 's president , dr. @entity74 , told reporters thursday that the legislation is " not a perfect representation of our views " but is close enough to warrant his group 's support and keep the reform process moving forward			1
@entity74 said the bill needs to be accompanied by legislation reversing scheduled @entity65 reimbursement payment reductions to physicians			0
responding to the @entity5 endorsement , @entity17 said the doctors ' group is " supporting reform because [ its members have ] seen firsthand what 's broken about our health care system , " @entity17 said			1
" they would not be supporting it if they really believed that it would lead to government bureaucrats making decisions that are best left to doctors			0
" watch @entity17 say health care reform is moving forward meanwhile , @entity18 @entity101 on thursday continued to signal their opposition to the measure			1
@entity101 leaders held a rally on @entity54 along with " @entity108 " movement protesters and other activists to warn that the @entity18 legislation would translate into a full - blown government takeover of the health care system			1
rep. @entity112 , @entity113 , told @entity1 's " @entity118 " on thursday that @entity8 had forgotten the lessons of august 's town hall meetings when angry conservatives criticized health care legislation			0
" i think what we 're going to see is the town hall coming to @entity0 , just to remind members of @entity21 [ that ] we 're the ones we would like you to pay attention to , not lobbyists			0
and we do n't want the government to own our health care , " @entity112 said			0
speaking at thursday 's opposition rally , actor @entity129 , who played @entity131 on the sitcom " @entity133 , " slammed the @entity41 bill as a form of socialism			1
" these are @entity138 , " @entity129 said			0
" we have to remember where their philosophy comes			0
it does n't come from @entity10			2
and socialism is a philosophy of failure			0
" @entity18 @entity8 have rejected an alternative $ 60 billion @entity101 plan as inadequate for meeting the goals of expanding health coverage to most of the nation 's 46 million uninsured while bringing down costs and ending controversial industry practices such as denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			1
@entity27 's bill would extend insurance coverage to 36 million uncovered @entity10 and guarantee that 96 percent of @entity10 have coverage , according to the @entity41 leadership			1
the claim is based on an analysis by the nonpartisan @entity162			0
among other things , the bill would subsidize insurance for poorer @entity10 and create health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to purchase coverage			1
it also would cap annual out - of - pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			0
@entity27 's office has said the bill would cut the federal deficit by roughly $ 30 billion over the next decade			2
the measure is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy @entity10 and spending constraints in @entity65 and @entity183			2
specifically , individuals with annual incomes more than $ 500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $ 1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge			0
growth in @entity65 expenditures would be cut by 1.3 percent annually			0
the @entity18 bill also includes a government - run public option			1
under the @entity18 plan , health care providers would be allowed to negotiate reimbursement rates with the federal government			2
@entity27 and other @entity197 had argued for a more " robust " public option that would tie reimbursement rates for providers and hospitals to @entity65 rates plus a 5 percent increase			2
several @entity8 representing rural areas , however , killed the proposal after complaining that doctors and hospitals in their districts would be shortchanged under such a formula			0
one thorny issue yet to be resolved among @entity18 @entity8 is the bill 's final language on abortion			2
rep. @entity214 , @entity215 , has been pushing leaders to add stronger language prohibiting the use of federal money to pay for abortions under the health care overhaul			0
@entity214 has vowed that if he is n't allowed a vote on the issue , a group of 40 anti-abortion @entity8 will work to block the bill from getting to the @entity18 floor			2
the @entity18 bill differs from legislation the @entity228 is considering in a number of critical ways			1
senate majority leader @entity231 , @entity232 , also favors a public option but would allow individual states to opt out of the plan			0
an $ 829 billion bill recently passed by the @entity237 does not include a tax surcharge on the wealthy but would impose a new tax on high - end health care policies , which critics have dubbed " @entity243 " plans			0
a large number of @entity18 @entity8 are opposed to taxing those policies , arguing that such a move would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous benefits			0
individuals under the $ 829 billion @entity237 plan would be required to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750			0
the @entity18 bill imposes a more stringent fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income			1
both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer @entity10			0
the @entity237 bill would require large companies to contribute to the health care costs of lower income workers if those workers received a government subsidy for insurance			0
the @entity18 legislation would require larger companies to provide employee insurance for everyone or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of total revenue			2
@entity41 leaders in both chambers agree on establishing nonprofit health care cooperatives and stripping insurance companies of an anti-trust exemption that has been in place since the end of @entity279 @entity231 refused earlier this week to predict when the chamber would pass a health care bill , possibly signaling difficulty in generating support from his entire @entity41 caucus			2
@entity1 's @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 contributed to this report .			0
