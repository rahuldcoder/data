-- the @entity1 made a winning start to their @entity4 campaign as a moment of defensive madness cost @entity7 dearly in @entity8 , while @entity9 defeated a disappointing @entity10 1 - 0 in monday 's other @entity12 match			1
the @entity13 failed to live up to their pre-tournament billing as one of the favorites , needing an own - goal less than a minute into the second half to settle their nerves and pave the way for an eventually comfortable 2 - 0 victory			1
@entity24 sealed the win with five minutes left , then defender @entity26 -- earlier at fault for the opening goal -- made a spectacular clearance from under his own crossbar to prevent an even more damaging defeat			1
@entity32 was the hero for @entity9 in @entity33 as his first half goal proved enough to beat 1990 quarterfinalists @entity10 and give the @entity37 side their first @entity4 win on foreign soil			1
@entity1 2 - 0 @entity7 the @entity1 started the match in at @entity41 with star forward @entity42 on the substitutes ' bench still resting his injured hamstring , but still boasted attacking potency in @entity47 and @entity24 plus the midfield presence of @entity49 and @entity50			1
but @entity7 slightly edged the first half as striker @entity52 -- who made a surprise recovery from injury to start the match -- headed wide , and then set up @entity55 for a shot that was well saved by @entity13 goalkeeper @entity57			2
but the game turned some 40 - odd seconds after the halftime restart when @entity26 , who plays for @entity13 club @entity60 , inexplicably headed @entity47 's cross onto the back of his helpless teammate @entity63 and into the net			1
the unlucky @entity63 was later credited with the own - goal by world governing body @entity66			1
with @entity52 going off after an hour , the @entity67 lost all attacking impetus despite the introduction of 18 - year - old forward @entity70 , the youngest player to appear so far at this year 's tournament			0
it became only a matter of time before the @entity13 extended their lead , with @entity76 's deflected shot looping onto the top of @entity79 's crossbar			0
@entity24 wrapped it up soon after with a simple chance , following up as @entity82 broke free down the left and beat @entity79 with his low shot but hit the post			2
@entity26 then made some amends for his earlier error as he got back to clear with @entity79 again beaten in the 88th minute			2
" the players were a little tense and frustrated in the first - half , we wanted to play beautiful football , but we lost the ball too often , " @entity1 coach @entity88 told @entity89			2
" things got better after the first goal , then you saw what we are capable of doing , we could have won by more			0
it was a huge relief when the second goal went in			0
" @entity9 1 - 0 @entity10 both @entity9 and @entity10 came into the @entity4 on a poor run of form , with the @entity37 team having lost four of the previous five games and the @entity107 winless in seven			1
after a dull opening , @entity9 started to press forward and deservedly took the lead seven minutes before the break			0
@entity110 swung over a deep cross from the right which eluded the entire @entity10 defense before landing at the feet of @entity115 , who calmly passed the ball into the net			2
@entity10 captain @entity119 , who appeared isolated on the right wing in the first half , carved his side 's first real opportunity early in the second			0
cutting in between three defenders , the @entity125 forward cut the ball back from the byline and teed up @entity129 , whose curled shot went narrowly wide			0
@entity9 , who reached the last 16 on home soil in 2002 , were organized and disciplined throughout and could have extended their lead when @entity136 's long - range strike drew a flying save from @entity138			0
@entity139 fired the rebound against a post , only to be flagged offside			0
moments later , the woodwork was shaking again at the other end of the pitch as @entity146 's fierce shot from outside the area smashed against the crossbar			0
@entity10 , the highest - ranked @entity107 side at the tournament , laid siege to the @entity9 goal in stoppage - time but could not find a way past the impressive @entity153 .			1

own - goal from @entity7 defender puts @entity1 on the way to 2 - 0 @entity12 victory
@entity26 heads cross off teammate @entity63 and into net for first goal after halftime
@entity13 seal victory with 85th - minute goal from @entity24 after @entity167 hits post
@entity32 scores only goal as @entity9 beat 1990 quarterfinalists @entity10 1 - 0
