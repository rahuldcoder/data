@entity0 -- tourism destinations deep inside @entity4 's tiger parks will be closed indefinitely after the @entity5 imposed an interim ban on all tourism activities in core areas of tiger forests			1
" ( until ) final directions of the court , core areas in tiger reserves will not be used for tourism activities , " the court said in the order issued tuesday , according to a report by the @entity13			1
the decision also imposed a fine of 10,000 rupees ( $ 178 ) on six states that did not comply with the court 's previous decision in april , which required that all states must identify core zones and buffer zones of their tiger reserves as part of a rolling effort to regulate where tourist attractions can be located			1
@entity4 is home to the world 's largest population of tigers -- 1,706 of them -- according to the @entity35			1
that number has dropped from more than 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century due to poaching and habitat encroachment			2

@entity47 reserves are set up throughout @entity4 to provide a protected environment for animals still in the wild			1
resorts and villages were set up for tourists , local as well as foreign , to see the tiger habitats and perhaps catch a glimpse of the big cat			1
now the future of tiger tourism is in question			2
the ban is in place while the court considers a claim filed by a local environmentalist alleging that ecotourism was hurting the habitat and breeding grounds of the endangered species			2
the court is expected to release its final ruling on august 22			0
ecotourism promises to bring travelers closer to nature with minimum environmental impact			2

" the eco in ecotourism has changed to economy , " @entity82 said			2
last april the court ruled that all states must identify core zones and buffer zones of their tiger parks as part of a rolling effort to regulate where tourist attractions can be located , according to the @entity13 report			1
tourist resorts and villages are to be located only in the buffer zones of parks			0
states are reluctant to identify buffer zones , however , for fear it will displace existing resorts , the @entity13 reported			0
@entity82 , however , does n't think buffer zones will solve the problems			0
" buffer zones are a step toward the solution , " @entity82 said			0
" but the question remains ' who is going to manage the buffer zones ? ' " video : meet @entity4 's tiger hunters wildlife enthusiast and photographer @entity117 of @entity119 , who has taken part in dozens of safaris in the past few years told @entity1 he believes that while the court 's heart is in the right place , its approach is flawed			1
" responsible and regulated tourism forges a human connection to wildlife			0
just seeing tigers in textbooks wo n't affect people to change , " he said			0
" if you stop tourists and enthusiasts , you 're losing half the battle of wildlife conservation , " he added			0
@entity117 also argues that responsible tourism enforces a system of accountability			0
the presence of undesired elements like poachers gets noticed , he said			0
the decision is not expected to have major immediate impact on tourism as many tiger reserves are closed during the monsoon			2
if the ban remains in place , however , it is expected to have a significant impact on the livelihoods of communities in and around the reserves whose income depends on wildlife tourism			0
