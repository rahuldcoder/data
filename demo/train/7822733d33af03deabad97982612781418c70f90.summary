-- frustrated @entity2 captain @entity1 was fined for arguing with the umpires as @entity4 took complete control of the fourth @entity6 in @entity7 on monday thanks to @entity9 's century			1
@entity1 , who faces the prospect of becoming the first skipper from his country to loses three @entity6 series since 1890 , was furious after having a video replay decision turned down			1
the 36 - year - old called for a referral after @entity4 batsman @entity16 was ruled not to have edged a delivery from @entity18 to wicketkeeper @entity19			2
video replays and sound technology showed no contact with the bat , but @entity1 nonetheless remonstrated with umpires @entity24 and @entity26			2
will @entity2 's one - day cricket reign end in 2011 ? match referee @entity28 subsequently fined @entity1 40 % of his match fee			1
he could have been banned for the final test in @entity31 , but received a lesser punishment			0
" @entity1 's actions as captain of his country were unacceptable , " the @entity33 said in a statement			2
" a captain is expected to set the example and not get involved in a prolonged discussion with the on - field umpires and question their decision			1
" while pleading guilty to the charge , @entity1 understood that the discussion went far too long			0
he apologized for his action and stated that he has nothing but respect for the umpires and his on - field actions were not intended to show disrespect to @entity24 or @entity26			0
" it was the latest setback for @entity1 , who went into the match nursing a fractured finger which has hampered his fielding , and he failed again with the bat as @entity2 made just 98 in sunday 's opening sessions			1
@entity4 in total command as @entity2 collapse at @entity58 @entity4 resumed on 157 - 0 but soon lost @entity59 as the left - hander added just two runs to his overnight 80 to become the first of @entity64 's three victims			1
@entity64 then dismissed captain @entity65 for 69 , but @entity9 and @entity16 added 92 for the third wicket			0
@entity16 was on 49 when the controversy struck , but although he survived to make his 21st half - century in 70 @entity70 the @entity69 - born player did not last much longer as @entity64 trapped him leg before wicket for 51 with a low delivery			0
@entity9 also had some luck before reaching 50 , having apparently been run out from @entity1 's throw before video replays gave him the benefit of the doubt			1
@entity2 level @entity6 series with emphatic @entity82 win @entity83 continued his revival of form which saw @entity2 level the series at 1 - 1 with victory in the last match in @entity82 , as the left - arm paceman had @entity90 ( 8 ) and the in - form @entity91 ( 1 ) caught hooking at short deliveries			0
@entity83 thought he had @entity94 out as well when the batsman was on just six , but a replay called for by @entity24 showed that he had bowled a no - ball			0
prior then helped @entity9 add an unbroken 158 for the sixth wicket as @entity4 reached stumps on 444 - 5 for a lead of 346 runs with three days still to play			1
@entity9 scored his third century in five @entity6 appearances and his fifth in 17 @entity70 overall as he ended the day on 141 , having hit 12 fours off 278 balls faced			2
prior , like @entity9 also born in @entity69 , took toll on the @entity107 bowlers as he smashed 10 fours in his 75 from just 105 deliveries			0
victory in @entity7 will mean that @entity4 retain the @entity6 urn no matter the result in the @entity31 finale starting on january 3 .			0

@entity4 lead @entity2 by 346 runs with five first - innings wickets remaining
@entity2 captain @entity1 fined after arguing with umpires over decision
he faces the prospect of an *embarrassing* third @entity123 *defeat* as skipper
@entity9 ends second day unbeaten on 141 after adding 158 with @entity94
