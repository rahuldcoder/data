" the doctors are pretty clear that we just have to wait and see , " @entity9 told @entity2 in an exclusive interview			2
the impact on @entity5 ' family has been huge , he said			1
asked how her husband , astronuat @entity15 , was faring , @entity9 said , " he is a @entity18 combat fighter and he can take about anything , but this is a terrible experience			2
" asked about @entity5 ' ability to survive a 9mm slug to the head , @entity9 said , " i can only think that @entity24 has more important things planned for her in the future			1
" even as he acknowledged that the motive for the shooting remains unknown , @entity9 faulted @entity5 ' opponents in last year 's elections for stirring up emotions in the campaign to an unacceptable level			1
" there were rallies around her office that seemed designed to intimidate her staff , which simply does n't seem very @entity40 to me , " he said , though he added that he never felt threatened			1
the rallies were organized by members of the @entity43 around @entity5 ' support for president @entity46 's health care bill , he said			1
" there was a level of vituperation that no one has ever seen , and there was , you know , the famous incident of people showing up with handguns and losing control of handguns that just fall in the street and brandishing handguns			0

" if you look at the demographics , you would not think that she could get elected , " he said			0
" the way she inspires people reminds me a little bit of when i worked for @entity102 ( the former @entity104 @entity1 congressman ) and the people that worked for @entity107 ( the late @entity104 senator from @entity108 ) -- people who would walk through a wall for the people they believed in			0
