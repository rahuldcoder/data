@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 's 2000 book " @entity5 " galvanized a generation to resist the lure of brands and corporatization			1
@entity10 , rock star and new style activist direct action such as protests and guerilla tactics such as culture jamming and graffiti were encouraged			1
back then the movement had teeth and energy , but very quickly it has not just deflated but sharply turned into a world of hyper consumption , according to @entity22			1
welcome to the @entity24 generation that is more likely to buy a wristband and ticket to @entity27 than hit the streets in protest			2
speaking this week at the @entity30 in the @entity31 , to promote her new book " @entity32 , " @entity22 attacked the " @entity10 - ization " of the protest movement , referring to @entity35 frontman @entity10 who is also an active anti-poverty campaigner			1
" the bono - ization of protest particularly in the @entity31 has reduced discussion to a much safer terrain			1
" referring to the @entity42 at @entity43 in 2005 she said , " it was the stadium rock model of protest -- there 's celebrities and there 's spectators waving their bracelets			1
it 's less dangerous and less powerful ( than grass roots street demonstrations			0
) " speaking to @entity2 , @entity22 said the new style of anti-poverty campaigning , where celebrities talk directly with government and business leaders on behalf of a continent ( such as @entity60 ) is another form of " noblesse oblige " where the rich and powerful club together to ' give something back			1
' " they are saying we do n't even need government anymore , it 's the replacement of nation states with corporate rule -- this @entity71 , including @entity72 that gets together to give a little something back			0
" " what 's complicated about the space that @entity10 and @entity77 ( @entity77 , founder of @entity78 ) are occupying is that it 's inside and outside at the same time -- there 's no difference			1
what 's significant about the @entity84 movement ( the @entity86 protests in 1999 and 2000 ) is that it 's less the tactics but the fact that it identifies that there are real power differences , winners and losers in this economic model			2
" @entity22 believes when celebrities such as @entity10 engage in talks with world leaders at forums such as @entity99 they are legitimizing the structures in place , and the inequalities that arise from these structures , rather than promoting any radical change ; " the story of globalization is the story of inequality			1
what 's been lost in the @entity10 - ization is ability to change these power structures			1
there are still the winners and losers , people who are locked in to the power structures and those locked out			0
" protests such as the @entity84 anti-globalization protests , " were really demanding a structural change			2
" but now but according to @entity22 , the rise in blogging and on - line protests has taken the heat out of direct action			1
" it 's safer to mouth off in a blog than put your body on the line			0
the @entity133 is an amazing organizing tool but it also acts as a release , with the ability to rant and get instant catharsis			0
it 's taken that sense of urgency away			0
" @entity10 's @entity141 initiative is emblematic of this new @entity24 age			2
he announced a new branded product range at the @entity145 in @entity146 last year called @entity141			0
@entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 were initial partners , joined later by @entity151 and @entity152			0
the corporations sell red branded products , with a percentage of profits going to @entity10 approved causes			2
in this @entity24 world there is an irony of consuming to end poverty			0
perhaps an even bigger irony : through initiatives like the red card , consumer culture and branding is buying a stake in anti-globalization and alleviating poverty movement			2
@entity22 says , " what they 've tapped into is a market niche			2
there 's nothing that 's inherently wrong with these initiatives except when they make radical claims that it 's going to end poverty			0
there 's a long history of radical consumption -- what 's pretty unbelievable about this ( the @entity184 ) is that they say it 's revolutionary and it 's going to replace other forms of politics			0
" instead @entity22 advocates for a more confrontational and engaged form of activism , " we have had mass social movements that are messy -- and that leads to some kind of negotiation and some kind of representation			1
what i see from the @entity10 camp is that they dismiss street protest as bunch as gripers whereas they ( @entity10 ) are being constructive because they engaging with power ( but ) if you look at the history of the labor movement its people outside trying to enforce change			1
" @entity2 spoke to a @entity1 - based activist @entity212 ( who did not wish to give her real name ) from the @entity214 who said " charity concerts are pathetic , just pathetic and a way to recorporate the issue			1
it 's enjoyable but ( from a political point of view ) it 's a waste of time			0
it diverts attention away from taking action and protest			2
nobody ever changes anything from attending a concert			0
" @entity22 agrees saying , " i think people go to concerts because it 's fun but i do n't get a sense from anyone i talk to that it 's effective politically			1
" long time human rights activist , @entity237 says despite the huge numbers marching in the anti-iraq war marches three years ago , " there is a sense of political powerlessness plus there 's been a shift to the right			0
" he sees the @entity10 - ization effect in the way " the protest movement has been incorporated -- the corporate agenda around consumerism and spending has just become another form of protest			1
" yet he does see the value in having people working with power to effect change : " the classic model of social change is that you need people on the inside talking to people in power and people on the outside shaking up the establishment -- a combination of the two getting results			0
the good cop , bad cop routine seems to have worked in the past			0
