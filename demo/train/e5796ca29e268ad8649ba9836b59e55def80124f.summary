-- how much do you hate it when some meddling boss is leaning way - too - close over your shoulder , micro-checking and second - guessing every bit of work you do ? well , if you think you hate it now , get ready			1
because , as annoying as it can seem today , every indication is that , as far as the stress of bosses hovering over your shoulder goes , these may soon be regarded as the good old days			1
the first signs of what is coming can be seen at nine @entity17 colleges this spring			1
at those schools , a pilot program designed by @entity19 , a @entity20 company that distributes electronic textbooks , is under way			1
the shift from print to digital , as we all know , is picking up velocity everywhere , including at colleges and universities			0
soon enough , just about all textbooks will be digital			0
which is where @entity19 comes in			1
not only does the company provide the electronic books -- it is offering professors and administrators the opportunity to do something previously impossible with books printed on paper			1
@entity19 keeps track of , and provides to professors , real - time data about how each student is using his or her digital textbooks , " including page views , time spent in a textbook , notes taken , highlights made , bookmarks used , and whether or not the student even opened the book , " according to @entity51 of the online publication inside @entity53 @entity19 says that this is all designed for the ultimate good of the students , because its software allows faculty to " identify ' at risk ' students based on engagement with assigned course materials " -- meaning : we know if you really studied the book last night			1
@entity70 , dean of the school of business at @entity73 , told reporter @entity74 of the @entity75 : " it 's @entity77 , sort of , but with a good intent			0
" maybe the intent is , indeed , worthy , as far as college classes are concerned			0
but you just know that , as soon as @entity19 perfects the software and launches it into widespread use , @entity17 business and industry are going to glom onto it and adapt it to the workplace			1
this is the tool that corporations everywhere have been waiting for : a way to stand over the shoulder of every employee , 24 hours a day , and keep track of exactly how much time he or she is really spending on his or her work			1
the technology would allow bosses to oh - so - casually tell their subordinates : " if you 're not too busy , why do n't you go over this report again tonight ? " and then , the next morning , say : " did you get a chance to work on that report ? " " yes , sir , i went over it at home on my @entity106 , and it looked fine to me			2
" " funny thing , @entity108 -- our software indicates that the last time you even looked at the report was two days ago			2
" oh , the possibilities are endless			0
it 's @entity77 , all right , corporate edition			0
employees will be judged not just by the quality or creativity or ingenuity or precision of their finished work , but will be electronically stared at -- smothered with second - by - second scrutiny -- as they do the work , wherever they are			2
already we have willingly given up the distinction between office time and home time ; e-mails and cellphones and text messages have erased that line			0
employees are always on call			0
and like it or not , @entity17 have become accustomed to being constantly observed			2
those key cards that corporations issue allow them to find out exactly when their employees were and were n't in the building ; the security cameras that dot @entity17 's streets and malls and factories have so quickly become ubiquitous that the startling thing is not when something is " caught on video " -- but when something somehow is n't			1
this , though -- the @entity19 experiment at those nine colleges , and what it could lead to in the business world -- is the beginning of the next phase			2
" you all set for the presentation tomorrow , @entity155 ? " " i am -- i 've been going over the numbers at home all weekend			0
" " have you , @entity155 ? because that 's not what our software program shows			0
" of course , the employees of the future , the working stiffs , could always object to this -- could demand to be judged on their finished work alone , could insist not to be electronically spied on , could tell their bosses that when they leave the office for the day or for the weekend they 're off the clock and off duty , and thus will not be available to be tracked remotely via their tablets and smartphones and laptops			1
they could take a bold and principled stand and say that			0
it would make for an amusing anecdote to tell the person in front of them in the unemployment line the next week			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2

@entity185 : we all hate a meddling boss closely watching you work over your shoulder
@entity19 provides electronic books and *monitors* students ' work for professors
before you know it , he says , @entity17 businesses will adapt software to the workplace
@entity185 : then , bosses can look over their employees ' shoulders 24/7
