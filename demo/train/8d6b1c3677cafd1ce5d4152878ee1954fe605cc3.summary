after 17 minutes and 14 seconds of sunday 's " @entity4 " encounter with @entity3 , @entity1 fans will offer a vocal demonstration of why the club 's motto is " @entity1 " -- more than a club			1
the team 's @entity8 stadium will erupt with the sound of the @entity12 national anthem , sung in the language native to this semi-autonomous region of @entity15			1
it is to commemorate september 11 , 1714 , and the people who died when the ruling monarchy defeated @entity12 troops during the @entity20			2
it is arguably the biggest club game in the world -- though all too often surrounded by a bucketload of bile between players , coaches and fans -- but as austerity tightens its grip on the @entity15 economy , the desire for @entity12 independence grows ever deeper			1
the fixture against @entity3 , a club so long synonymous with @entity15 's rulers and its royalty , provides a poignant opportunity for the @entity12 cause to be expressed directly to the @entity3 powers			1
" for every @entity42 gives to @entity15 , it only receives 57 cents , " @entity12 sports commentator @entity40 told @entity41			1
" there is a feeling of injustice regarding the fiscal system			2
" " also there are the constant political attacks in terms of linguistic policy			2
for @entity52 the language is very important			1
@entity12 is different from @entity15 language , not better or worse , just different			1
" the @entity15 government is trying to erode the educational system where in @entity52 you study in @entity12 but also @entity15 ... the government is trying to regain the power in the education system			1
" so on sunday in a demonstration of national pride , 98,000 placards will turn the @entity8 into a giant @entity12 flag emblazoned with the word " @entity1 ! " prior to kick off			1
" it symbolizes the @entity12 sentiment , " continued @entity40			0
" it 's the color of the @entity12 flag			0
people come to enjoy the football , yes , but also to make clear it is a time to be @entity12			0
" the @entity12 nationalism cause has a powerful supporter in the shape of iconic former @entity1 coach @entity75 , who led the team to 14 trophies during a glittering four seasons in charge			1
speaking from @entity80 , where he is currently living , @entity75 delivered a video message of support to his native region on @entity52 's national day , saying : " here 's one more vote for independence			1
" despite the views of one of its favorite sons , the football club is less forthright in extolling the virtues of independence , reflecting that not all @entity1 fans are against a unified @entity15			1
however , @entity40 suggests the success of @entity1 's football team and the views of some of the region 's other top sport stars has helped promote the idea of self governance			1
" i would say there is an increasing union around @entity1 of people who did n't necessarily care about the independence of @entity52 but now understand the reasons through football and the club 's other sports teams , " added @entity40			1
" @entity112 , a @entity113 basketball player for @entity1 , said he is open to independence			1
" in football , the team is less explicit			0
@entity117 and @entity118 , for example are proud to be @entity12 but they have n't said openly they would play for @entity52 instead of @entity15			1
" @entity52 even has its own national football team , though it is not allowed to participate in @entity122 or @entity124 championships			2
the team , which has been playing fixtures since 1912 , are permitted to play matches but are barred from participating in competitions which @entity15 also contests			2
over the years , @entity52 's best players such as @entity117 , @entity75 and @entity118 have pulled on the red and gold shirt alongside " guest " stars such as @entity134 and @entity135			2
but it is @entity1 , with its core of local players , which has come to represent @entity12 footballing honor and so fixtures with @entity3 have a tendency to become ill - tempered			1
red cards and the red mist have become the norm			0
in august 2011 @entity3 coach @entity146 poked @entity147 -- @entity75 's then assistant who has gone on to replace him in the hotseat -- in the eye during a touchline fracas			2
in 2000 @entity152 was the subject of @entity1 fans ' ire after moving to @entity3 , and when he returned to the @entity8 as one of @entity3 's fabled " @entity159 " , the @entity157 forward was pelted with objects including cigarette lighters , cell phones and a pig 's head			1
however , rather than breed contempt , familiarity seems to have begun to blunt this rivalry			0
last season the teams played each other on six occasions , after five meetings during the 2010 - 11 campaign			0
" there have been an awful lot of @entity176 over the last few years , which really has diluted things quite a bit , " said @entity3 - based @entity15 football expert @entity173			1
" it 's not like it was even 12 months ago , when you had @entity146 and @entity75 really kicking off at each other			0
" we had the two @entity176 recently and nothing happened then			0
we actually had two calm and quite exciting games			0
" and just as in the rest of @entity15 , the people of @entity3 have worries which are more pressing than whether @entity190 or @entity191 is the world 's best footballer as unemployment climbed to nearly 25 percent last month			1
recent protests against anti-austerity measures taken by @entity15 prime minister @entity197 's government led to violent confrontations between civilians and police on the streets of the capital			1
" what we saw was a situation gone bad , " continued @entity173			0
" some protestors were infiltrated by those looking for a riot			0
almost all the time demonstrations here go very peacefully , that 's why it made the news			0
" there have n't really been any instances since			0
people are just suffering at the minute			0
" with @entity3 currently trailing table - toppers @entity1 by eight points heading into the first league @entity4 of the season , the @entity3 club 's fans have n't had much to cheer either			1
despite that start which has seen @entity146 team drop eight points in its first six matches , @entity173 suggests this weekend 's match offers real fans brief respite from a dark financial climate			2
" it 's a distraction from the grim reality of life for many in @entity15 at the moment , " he said			2
" it gives them something to smile about			0
this @entity4 is not a massively hyped one			2
in recent years we have had @entity240 semifinals and all this bitterness built up between the two teams			0
a lot of that has been taken out of it			0
" and what do @entity246 make of calls for @entity12 independence ? " it 's hard to speak for everyone here , @entity3 is very diverse , " responded @entity173			2
" a lot of people simply do n't care			0
" back in @entity1 , @entity40 suggested @entity15 's financial woes might have given the campaign for @entity258 extra impetus			1
" the feeling is that it has probably helped to create new converts to the independence movement , " he said			0
" in @entity263 , the richer states give 4 % to the gdp , to the central government			0
" in @entity52 , it is 8 % and everyone in @entity52 is becoming more conscious of the problem			2
" @entity40 remains hopeful he will see a day when @entity52 has true independence from @entity15			1
" it will be very slow , " he said			0
" it will take some time and some verbal violence			0
i 'm not happy to live in this moment , because from @entity15 come some insults from @entity52			1
" i think both parties will reach an agreement			0
i 'm not sure if it will be to celebrate a democratic referendum			0
it will probably take at least another year			0

@entity1 face @entity3 on sunday in " @entity4 "
@entity15 is *engulfed* by serious financial *crisis*
many in @entity52 are calling for the semi-autonomous region to become independent
anti-austerity measures have led to protests and violent clashes in @entity3
