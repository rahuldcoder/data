while boycott petitions against " @entity5 " home @entity2 take off , the network itself is staying quiet			1
since its wednesday decision to " indefinitely " suspend @entity7 , one of the stars of its highly rated reality series , @entity2 has yet to publicly clarify what the future of the show might be , what they 'll do with their block of reruns , or even what it really means to be " indefinitely " suspended			1
the network 's lack of communication has done nothing to stem the tide of detractors who strongly disagree with its decision to put @entity7 on the bench over remarks quoted in @entity29 , in which he called homosexuality a sin , citing the @entity33			1
a change.org petition demanding that @entity7 be reinstated and the network issue an apology was steadily climbing toward 100,000 signatures friday			0
a separate petition at a website called @entity40 makes a similar appeal			0
hosted by the online community @entity44 , the website helps its members spend their money with companies that fall in line with their spiritual beliefs			0
the petition on @entity40 had surpassed 130,000 signatures by friday evening			0
those who 've signed the @entity40 petition are asking for their " views ( to ) be treated with equality and respect in @entity57 's rich rainbow of diversity , " and for the " network to immediately reinstate mr. @entity7 to ' @entity5 , ' and to formally apologize to him , his family , and the millions of viewers who tune in every week , stand by him , and share his worldview			1
" " while the lgbt community may be offended by his opposing viewpoint , " that webstite continues , " your rash , discriminatory , and unfair treatment toward mr. @entity7 -- a recognized symbol of the faith community -- is a slap in the face to @entity44 and everyday @entity57 alike			0
" both websites are urging people not to watch @entity2 programming in the meantime			1
so far , the number of petitioners does n't compare with the millions that " @entity5 " has drawn to @entity2 -- its fourth - season premiere in august set a record with 11.8 million watching , and the season finale in october brought in 8.4 million -- but those signatures would give any network exec flop sweat			1
especially when the rest of the @entity7 family has stoked the fire with a statement that suggests the future of the show might be in jeopardy			0
" we have had a successful working relationship with @entity2 but , as a family , we can not imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm , " the family said in a statement			2
" we are in discussions with @entity2 to see what that means for the future of ' @entity5			1
' " according to @entity107 senior media correspondent @entity104 , conventional wisdom in the industry holds that this current disagreement between @entity2 and the family will resolve itself in time , in part because the two sides benefit so much from being in business with the other			1
a person with close ties to @entity2 noted that the @entity7 family is under contract , thereby reducing the chances that the family will show up on another channel anytime soon			2
an @entity2 executive who spoke to @entity104 on condition of anonymity , because the channel was avoiding any new public comments about the controversy , said that conversations with the @entity7 family would likely resume after the @entity128 holiday			2
" everybody just needs to take a breath , " the executive said			0
the @entity2 executive insisted that there has been no second - guessing at the channel about the decision to suspend @entity7			2
all of which gives rise to the question : what would happen to @entity2 were " @entity5 " to go away ? this is , after all , the show that helped the network to raise its total viewership 10 % this year , according to @entity141			1
@entity104 ca n't see the @entity143 or @entity2 wanting to end the televised hunting - business fun so soon , but if it were to happen , it would undoubtedly be a blow to the network , he said			1
" there 's just nothing else on the channel that 's nearly as popular as new episodes of ' @entity5 , ' " @entity104 said			1
" it would be like @entity152 losing new episodes of ' @entity154 ' or like @entity155 losing ' @entity156			0
' that 's why it is very , very unlikely			0
the show is hugely important for the channel and for the family			0
not just @entity7 , but the whole family , " which , @entity104 notes , is n't affected by the suspension			0
given that @entity7 is " a main character " on the fifth season , which is scheduled to premiere january 15 , @entity104 believes the increased attention thanks to the uproar might even give " @entity5 " a ratings boost in 2014			2
but if something were to happen to the show in the long run , then yes , @entity2 would certainly need to regroup			2
on the other hand , it 's not like the network has n't bounced back before -- and it 's never been a one - show network			1
over the past 10 years alone , it 's transitioned from being the prime place to find a rerun of " biography " to the home of the @entity181 - winning " intervention , " to the site of reality shows like " @entity184 " as well as original programming like " @entity186			0
" in october , @entity2 unveiled a new branding strategy centered around the tagline " @entity189			2
" the campaign , the @entity141 noted at the time , was scheduled to debut during -- what else ? -- a " @entity5 " special on december 11			1
and yet , as industry trade variety emphasizes , it is not unusual for a network to make a bold move in severing ties with a controversial figure , no matter how popular			2
@entity199 bid adieu to @entity200 after the actor fired off another unprintable outburst at a photographer , and the @entity204 declined to renew its contract with one of its most well - known personalities , @entity209 , after she admitted to using the " n " word in the past			0
@entity2 itself previously put another fan - favorite reality star , @entity214 " @entity216 , on hiatus after he used a racial slur			0
with its response to the " @entity5 " situation , the network " has been able to establish its progressive corporate values , maintain its relationship with advertisers , and not collapse an entire reality show in the process , " @entity220 reporter @entity219 observes			1
" the bullet was n't entirely dodged , but it at least did n't hit a main artery			0

two online petitions are encouraging people not to watch @entity2
the network still has n't publicly commented since wednesday
@entity107 's senior media correspondent does n't see " @entity5 " going away
but , if it did , it would n't be the first time a network made a similar move
