-- @entity1 has not resolved how to deal with @entity3 's nuclear program			1
as foreign policy issues soar in the next presidential race , it is time to search for substantive answers			0
@entity1 policies to contain @entity3 's nuclear program suffer from wishful thinking			1
tightened sanctions and an open war option against @entity3 have failed to alter its behavior			1
they fail to grasp how fierce @entity3 is			2
@entity3 's revolutionaries see sanctions as a blessing in disguise			1
oddly , sanctions build a degree of political unity in @entity3			1
its political factions agree on retaining nuclear enrichment capacity despite other highly divisive political disagreements			0
under sanctions , @entity3 is more self - dependent			1
president @entity27 has said that @entity3 is increasing enriching uranium to 20 percent grade levels			2
if true , and the fuel is produced in abundance , it has potential military dimensions			0
sanctions have made @entity3 more enterprising too			1
the @entity34 ( @entity35 ) has deployed quite a few tactics to circumvent sanctions			0
sanctions validate @entity3 's embattled mindset			1
@entity3 supreme leader @entity40 says he will not shun war if it is the price to pay to reject the @entity1 the average beleaguered @entity3 is content enough knowing life goes on in war times			1
after all , @entity3 lived through one of the longest wars in the 20th century , fighting @entity46 in the 1980s			2
the war threats have also made @entity3 clear about its objectives			0
@entity35 says it will not differentiate between @entity50 and @entity1 targets if @entity3 were attacked by either			1
it believes @entity3 troops will have a far better chance of combat survival in a vast regional battle ground which they get to define			0
war threats have also made @entity3 deceptively good at demoralizing the enemy			0
@entity3 does not believe it will be attacked because @entity1 forces are war - weary after @entity46 and @entity59			1
@entity50 will likely not strike as long as it is surrounded by hostile @entity61 forces in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
in the rest of the @entity69 world , it is hard to find sympathy for @entity50 's cause of killing the @entity3 nuclear program while it retains a military nuclear strategy			1
clearly , @entity3 's @entity75 revolution frequently fails to grasp the depth of troubles it faces by being so defiant			0
it likes to hedge that regional events will work in its favor as other @entity61 forces rise to challenge @entity50 and the @entity1 it also hedges that its indefinite tolerance for suffering , the result of the @entity83 belief system , will work in its favor when it faces impatient demands by the @entity1 to change course			2
the @entity1 is also hedging like @entity3 , but with a different set of tools			1
it hedges that sanctions and war threats will contain @entity3			2
and when it seems otherwise , it calls for time for sanctions to take effect while postponing the war option			0
@entity96 believes a deal with @entity3 could be made , but it is confused how			0
it believes in engaging @entity3 by using a stick , admits @entity3 's big trade partners @entity101 and @entity102 do not support sanctions , then urges staunch @entity3 allies like the @entity106 government to respect sanctions			2
@entity108 leads to self - deception			0
it deceived @entity3 into accelerating a controversial nuclear program believing that it is a price worth paying			2
it deceived @entity96 to overstate the imminence of @entity50 military action against @entity3 , and @entity3 's hostile intents towards @entity50			0
numerous @entity50 officials speak against attacking @entity3 , and provocative @entity3 statements are calculated risks to keep @entity50 on its toes			0
whether in an @entity119 or a @entity121 administration , @entity96 must cease hedging and stick to the basics			0
the road begins by admitting that if @entity3 acquires know - how to build a nuclear bomb , it wo n't be the first time the @entity1 failed to prevent a developing country from becoming a nuclear state			1
a nuclear @entity3 , even if it acquired weapons capability , should not define the end - game			2
@entity96 should avoid missing the forest for the trees			0
it should recognize that convincing @entity3 not to build a bomb might be easier by engaging it			1
@entity3 's current strategic military doctrine rejects the use of weapons of mass destruction			0
by the end of the road , @entity96 should set a mutually agreed deadline with @entity3 to arrive at a win - win solution			0
it should also assure @entity50 that its safety is guaranteed			0
this can be done by engaging @entity50 and @entity3 's @entity69 neighbors in a region - wide initiative on the future of non-proliferation in the @entity149 while talks with @entity3 carry on			2
sanctions should roll back , with @entity50 and @entity69 state endorsements , if @entity3 makes tangible progress in talks			1
@entity96 should demand that @entity3 's leaders silence revolutionary pessimists and special interest groups that do not think a thaw in @entity3 - @entity1 ties is possible or warranted			1
@entity1 leadership to engage with @entity3 is crucial now more than ever			1
good leadership requires clear vision and achievable objectives			0
then soon enough , the @entity3 will do quick math. if being friendly with the @entity1 is more lucrative than being hostile , they will choose the former over the latter .			1
