-- @entity1 came to the law late in life			1
he was already around 40 when he started law school at @entity5 in @entity6 , drawn in by his work with the mentally ill , classmate and one - time law partner @entity8 said			1
becoming a district attorney " was what he always wanted to do , " @entity8 said			2
@entity1 was killed over the weekend , shot to death along with his wife , @entity13			1
friends found the couple dead saturday evening in their home in @entity17 , on the eastern outskirts of @entity19			2
he was elected in 2010 to the post of district attorney in @entity22 , where one of his assistant prosecutors was gunned down outside the courthouse in january			0
now his own slaying is at the heart of a @entity29 - size whodunit that has left local , state and federal investigators scrambling for answers			0
" they were the consummate good people , " @entity8 said			1
" we kidded @entity1 because he had no identifiable vices , and we all had vices			1
we either drank too much or smoked too much or chased women			0
but @entity1 had no identifiable vices , and @entity13 was solid gold			1
" who 's killing @entity29 prosecutors ? chilling mystery leaves county on edge another colleague , @entity47 district attorney @entity46 , called @entity1 " a big bear of a guy , never met a stranger			1
" " he said what he meant , and i 'm sorry this tragedy followed him , " @entity46 told @entity0 's @entity50			0
both @entity53 had master 's degrees in psychology , said @entity8 , now the district attorney in @entity56 , on the opposite side of the sprawling @entity19 - @entity58			0
they had met in the field and were dating while @entity1 attended law school , he said			1
their marriage was the second for both ; they had five children between them , all grown now , @entity8 said			0
the 63 - year - old @entity1 grew up in @entity68 , where his parents had a ranch			1
he joined the @entity71 after attending the @entity72 and still held a major 's commission in the reserves when @entity76 invaded @entity77 in 1990 , sparking the @entity78			0
@entity8 said @entity1 was called up shortly after finishing law school and trained soldiers in psychological warfare during the 1991 conflict			1
@entity8 , who had been a police officer , and @entity1 were older than the average student at @entity5 and soon became study partners			1
" he decided that he wanted to go into the law particularly to be a prosecutor , but those opportunities do n't come along that often , " @entity8 said			2
" so when we graduated , we went down to @entity90 , down on the coast , and opened a law office and practiced criminal defense work			2
" drawing on his earlier training , @entity1 took on a lot of court - appointed work for mentally ill defendants , @entity8 said			1
@entity13 was a gourmet cook , and " she used to bring some of the most fantastic lunches to the office when we were there , " he said			0
eventually , both moved back to north @entity29 , where @entity1 set up a law practice in @entity22			1
he had been a psychologist for the @entity29 @entity106 and @entity107 before going to law school and became a mental health judge after getting his law degree ; his wife got a job at the state mental hospital in @entity114 and was still practicing there when she was killed , @entity8 said			1
@entity8 was elected to his office in 2006			0
when @entity1 decided to run for @entity22 's chief prosecutor 's post four years later , his friend came over to " get the lay of the land about what it was like to be an elected @entity124 " @entity125 , another friend of @entity1 's , told @entity0 's @entity126 that lawyering was a collegial business in the county of about 100,000			1
" everybody knew each other here			0
it was a great place to practice law , " @entity125 said			2
" everybody liked the district attorney 's office			0
there just was n't a lot of activity out here			0
so the biggest shock out here this morning is why , in @entity22 , @entity29 , are we having an assistant @entity124 get killed and an elected @entity124			0
it 's really sending some shock waves through the community			0
" @entity1 won a three - way race in the 2010 @entity150 primary and ran unopposed in the general election			1
@entity8 said he and @entity1 kept in touch " here and there " until january , when @entity1 's assistant district attorney , @entity153 , was shot to death in a still - unsolved case			1
" he was bound and determined to find out who had done that to @entity153 , and @entity1 was fearless , " @entity8 said			1
he was like , ' they better come prepared , because there 'll be a fight			0
' " after @entity153 's killing , @entity1 publicly vowed to bring the " scum " who killed his assistant to justice			2
" we 're going to pull you out of whatever hole you 're in , we 're going to bring you back and let the people of @entity22 prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law , " he said			1
but in mid-february , @entity8 said @entity1 told him , " my greatest fear is that it was one person , acting alone , who does n't drink , " eliminating the chance that a liquored - up perpetrator would ever confess			2
" that 's vintage @entity1 right there			2
" since the killings , @entity8 said prosecutors from several counties have exchanged theories about what happened , " but frankly , none of us know			0
" " we 're used to hearing this sort of thing happening in @entity188 or even @entity189			2
we 're not used to hearing about judicial officials targeted in the @entity192 , " @entity8 said			2
" it 's hard to say whether this is a local phenomenon that involves only one issue locally there , or whether this is the beginning of a trend			0
as a prosecutor , i can just tell you , we ca n't ignore it			0
" " we 're looking out the peephole when the doorbell rings now , where we maybe we were n't before , " he added			1
