@entity0 -- another @entity2 ? another @entity3 ? in reporting on the 2016 presidential campaign , much of the media will likely echo the theme that @entity7 set forth during a @entity9 interview in january , in which the former first lady said that -- while she believed that her son , former @entity12 gov. @entity2 , was " the best qualified person to run for president " -- americans should widen the pool of applicants			1
" i think this is a great @entity14 country , great country , and if we ca n't find more than two or three families to run for high office , that 's silly , " she said			1
many @entity14 would seem to agree			0
there is even a new online petition that was launched this week urging @entity14 to take a stand against " hereditary family rule			0
" the organizer is a liberal online activism group called @entity28 , which notes that in seven presidential elections in a row , spanning from 1980 to 2004 , there was a " @entity2 " or a " @entity3 " on the presidential ticket of a major party			1
organizers are worried that this trend is likely to start up again in 2016			0
you 'll hear this sentiment a lot over the next year or so â € ” that @entity2 's biggest problem is " @entity2 fatigue " and that electing @entity40 means reliving " the @entity3 years			1
" supposedly , the biggest liability for these potential candidates is the burden of their last names			1
for these two likely presidential hopefuls , their names are the least of their worries			1
here are the five more formidable obstacles that could keep @entity40 and @entity2 away from the @entity52 : -- the @entity53			1
neither @entity40 nor @entity2 seems capable of explaining , clearly and succinctly , why she or he wants to be president			1
i do n't think they could do it if they had all day , let alone , as the saying goes , in the time it takes to complete an elevator ride			2
the same problem plagued sen. @entity64 , @entity65 , in 1980 , and it crippled his insurrectionary bid against the incumbent president , @entity67			1
in the case of @entity40 and @entity2 , the answer ca n't simply be : " well , this is a family tradition			1
and it 's my turn			0
" we need to know why they want to be president , and why the country would be better off if they reached that goal			2
-- the " @entity78 " factor			0
@entity40 is no @entity3 , and @entity2 is no @entity79			1
both the 42nd president and the 43rd had a special gift of being able to relate to voters			2
they were likable , and both genuinely seemed to enjoy being around people			2
they were polarizing figures , but the half of @entity14 that liked them did so intensely			0
they connected emotionally with voters by sharing stories , memories and values			0
you either have that ability , or you do n't			2
neither @entity40 nor @entity2 has it			1
either one would make a great president			2
but presidents are not appointed			0
@entity14 elect people to whom they can relate			2
and we 'll never know if we relate to you , if you do n't open up			2
@entity14 want candidates who are sunny , optimistic and uplifting			0
whether he is talking about immigration or economic development , @entity2 likes to use the word : " aspirational			1
" he understands that @entity14 want a president who leads them not just forward , but also up			2
but he does n't practice what he preaches			2
he rarely looks happy when talking about running for president			2
the same goes for @entity40 , who seems weary when the subject comes up , as if she has been carrying around for the last decade the enormous weight of breaking what her supporters like to call the " ultimate glass ceiling			1
" these two do n't look " aspirational			0
running for president is a long and brutal journey and the folks who pull it off are the ones with a burning intensity inside of them			0
excitement and confidence are contagious , and people respond to candidates who speak from the heart and have an emotional stake in the issues			1
many democrats are responding to the passion of sen. @entity133 , @entity65 , and they hope she runs for president			0
many republicans get excited by the likes of sen. @entity137 , @entity138 , or sen. @entity139 , @entity140			0
the most valuable weapon a candidate has is n't charisma , or experience , or a war chest			0
if you do n't have it , do n't bother running			0
it 's not clear that @entity40 and @entity2 have it			1
getting elected president is about getting your base to fall in line even if they have n't fallen in love			1
for @entity40 , the challenge is bringing together the " @entity159 " who like to go to war with the rich and the @entity163 business interests that get skittish when @entity131 sing populist anthems			1
for @entity2 , the heavy lift is uniting @entity167 radicals who have declared war against the @entity170 establishment with moderate voices that want a more inclusive party			1
it 's been said that you ca n't serve two masters			0
but , as @entity40 and @entity2 may be about to learn , it 's also true that you ca n't advance two narratives â € ” especially when they are at odds			1
the 2016 election will not be about last names			0
it 'll be about what elections are usually about : the candidates who are running and what kind of people they are			0
you ca n't spin that , or cover it up			0
it comes out in the end			0
and it goes a long way toward deciding who gets to the @entity52 and who goes home empty - handed .			0

@entity198 : aside from famous names , @entity2 , @entity3 share a problem
neither @entity2 nor @entity40 can say succintly why they want to be president , he says
they do n't connect with people on an emotional level as @entity3 , @entity79 did , he says
