-- the president of @entity2 said the college is canceling its summer band camp program and suspending all clubs as the school continues to deal with the fallout from the suspected hazing death of a marching band student			1
" our top priority is the health , safety and well being of students , " said @entity2 president @entity10 on tuesday			1
" we are convening a panel of experts and outstanding thinkers to provide advice and recommendations on the operation of student organizations			0
before we enter into a new student intake process , we should have the benefit of the work coming from the committees and the investigations			0
" the move comes weeks after four members of the university 's fabled marching 100 band were arrested on hazing - related charges			1
those charges are unrelated to the suspected hazing - related death of drum major @entity35 in november			1
@entity2 police arrested three of the students january 16 ; the fourth turned himself in the next morning , said @entity39 , the @entity2 spokeswoman			1
the students -- @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 -- are accused of hazing five @entity46 band members who wanted to join a group in the clarinet section known as the " clones			1
" the five told police they were made to line up according to height at the start of each meeting			0
then they were punched , slapped and paddled , according to the arrest warrant			0
one of the students , who quit the pledging process after the first meeting , took a digital photo of the bruising on her body			2
first established in 1990 , the band camp has offered scholarships for aspiring musicians at high schools across the region			2

champion , 26 , collapsed in @entity92 on a bus carrying members of the band after a november football game that included a halftime performance by the group			2
@entity99 , a lawyer for @entity91 's family , has charged that @entity91 died after receiving " some dramatic blows , perhaps ( having an ) elevated heart rate " tied to " a hazing ritual " that took place on the bus			2
some band members have said @entity91 died after taking part in a rite of passage called " crossing @entity110 " one member , who spoke on condition of anonymity , explained that students " walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members , and you get beaten until you get to the back			2
" no one has been charged in @entity91 's death ; the @entity125 and the @entity126 are investigating the case			0
the @entity125 also launched a separate investigation into band employees , who were allegedly engaged in financial fraud			0
the medical examiner 's office has said champion " collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body			1

" i totally support this effort , " said @entity144 , president of @entity145			0
