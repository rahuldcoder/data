-- for nearly 20 years @entity1 has held onto every memory of the night she was abducted from her bedroom , raped and left for dead			1
@entity1 remembers small details of the night she was abducted , raped and her throat slashed at age 8			1
it was august 10 , 1990			2
@entity1 was 8 years old and lived alone with her mother in the first floor of an apartment complex in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the bedroom windows faced the parking lot			1
investigators were never able to identify a suspect , but new dna testing may change that			1
@entity0 normally does not identify victims of sexual assaults			2
but @entity1 wants to go public with her story -- and her name -- to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker			1
" it 's not about me anymore , " she explained			2
" it 's about all the little girls that go to sleep at night			2
i know there are so many girls out there who have been raped and hurt			1
you have to fight back			1
" for that , @entity1 , 27 , is relying on her voice , her memory and advances in dna testing			1
" i remember everything ; i 've always wanted to remember everything , so i can find the person that did this , " @entity1 told @entity0 during a phone interview			1
" if i had blocked this out of my memory , the investigation would n't have come this far			2
" @entity1 says she was alone in her bed when a man came creeping in through the window			1
she remembers waking up in a stranger 's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot			2
" when i opened my eyes , his face was the first thing i saw and he covered my face and mouth , " she said			0
" he ran with me to his car			0
he told me he was an undercover cop and that he knew my family			0
he seemed calm -- not nervous , not aggressive			0
" after they left the parking lot , he drove her through the streets of @entity11 , @entity12 , pulling into a mechanic shop next to her elementary school			2
the moon will change colors and that is when your mom will come to get you , " she recalled him saying			0
" oh , it looks like she is not coming			0
" @entity1 said he drove her to an overgrown field next to the school and raped her			1
" he had a knife to my throat and touched my face and offered me @entity82 's pieces , " she said			2
" i was scared but i knew i could n't be fast enough to get away			0
cars would drive by but i could n't get away to get help			0
" she believes she passed out			0
" i woke up to him dragging me by my ankles , " she said			0
" i felt thorns ripping the skin off my back			2
i would see him turn to look at me and i would play dead			2
" she passed out again , and awoke at daybreak			0
" i remember feeling dew around me and i could n't figure out why when i screamed i could n't hear myself , " said @entity1			1
she lay naked on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed from ear to ear , and her voice box torn			1
much later , she said , " i heard children playing hide and seek			0
that is when one of the kids tripped over my foot , " said @entity1			1
she was found at 6 p.m. on a hot august day			2
she had been lying in the field for nearly 12 hours			0
she was rushed to the hospital in critical condition			0
" three days after the attack , i started giving a description			2
the doctors told me i would never be able to talk again , but i proved them all wrong , " said @entity1			1
she believes she got her voice back so she could tell her story			2
" i never wanted to play the victim role			0
i wanted to be a strong survivor , " she said			0
but the attack left its mark			1
" for the first two years , i had nightmares and was scared , " she said			0
" but i never wanted sympathy			0
... if i had given up , he would have won , and i wanted to show him : ' you did n't win			0
' " @entity122 said she is now " on a manhunt			0
" @entity126 @entity125 special agent @entity124 is one of the lead investigators in the case , along with @entity11 police detective @entity129			1
both men were discussing the case , when @entity124 received a memo from the @entity125 's @entity132 , saying they were looking for cold child abduction cases that could be retested for dna evidence			1
the @entity1 case was one of the cases selected			1
@entity124 , who has 10 years of experience in child abduction cases , said he has never seen a case like @entity1 's			1
" this is the only one that i can think of that the victim has suffered some traumatic injuries and survived , " he said , " the main reason the card team picked this case was because she was alive			0
in cases of child abduction it is rare that the child is recovered alive			0
frequently you recover a body and most times you never find them			0
" @entity1 is a living witness who can help put the pieces together			1
the investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago , which can be retested			0
it includes the underwear and pajamas @entity1 was wearing , as well as a man 's underwear and t - shirt , which were found in the field where @entity1 was left for dead			1
the clothes were tested in 1990 , but the sample was n't large enough for conclusive results			0
but now , modern techniques allow @entity168 to be isolated from a single human cell			0
once they get back the dna results -- " any time now , " @entity1 said -- they will run them through the @entity125 's criminal database and see if they get a match			1
the @entity125 has also offered a $ 10,000 reward for information that could lead to a break in the case			1
and last weekend @entity1 appeared in " @entity181 , " which resulted in several leads from viewers who called in with information			1
" someone might remember something about that night , " @entity1 said			1
" @entity11 is a really small community			0
i know someone in town knows something			0

@entity1 was *grabbed* from her bedroom and attacked at age 8
she was raped , her throat was slashed and she was left for dead
she is publicly talking about the attack in an attempt to catch the man
the @entity125 is investigating and advanced dna tests are *due* back any day
