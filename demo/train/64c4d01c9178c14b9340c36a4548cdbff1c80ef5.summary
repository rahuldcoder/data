a bloodied but defiant activist -- his face scarred , an ear severely cut , his body " beaten @entity10 " -- has become the latest symbol of the turmoil in @entity6 , stirring fresh anger in that country and elsewhere as the political standoff drags on			2
the visibly battered @entity11 reappeared thursday , more than a week after he went missing amid anti-government protests			0
he told reporters he 'd been kidnapped and tortured by his captors -- who , he claimed , " crucified me " by piercing his hands -- before being dumped in a forest			2
@entity19 footage shows blood caked on his head where he said his ear was cut			0
@entity11 , who organized convoys of motorists as part of the so - called @entity27 protest movement , said his abductors -- seemingly unable to grasp that protesters were there on their own free will -- asked him who was funding the effort			2
@entity6 protester wants to live in a lawful state one day later , the uproar over his treatment and that of the opposition built			1
much of this anger and pressure was directed at @entity6 's embattled government , even if it has n't been directly implicated in what happened to @entity11			2
@entity44 -- head of the @entity46 party and the most high - profile opposition leader -- blasted the activist 's treatment as " an act of intimidation of all active citizens			1
" " many @entity27 activists have suffered , " the former world champion boxer added , noting protesters who 've had their cars smashed and been arrested in the unrest			2
the views from outside @entity6 were n't much kinder			0
saying the @entity60 government was " appalled by obvious signs of torture , " @entity62 spokesman @entity61 said , " we are deeply concerned by increasing reports of protesters disappearing and being beaten and tortured , as well as by attacks on journalists			1
@entity61 added : " it is especially concerning that some of these reports have suggested the involvement of security forces			0
" the @entity77 is investigating what happened to @entity11 , state news agency @entity75 reported			0
the @entity80 's foreign policy chief , @entity79 , said after meeting friday with @entity6 opposition leaders that -- even after all this public , international anger -- she is " deeply alarmed by the violence and cases of intimidation and torture			1
" " i am particularly appalled by the cruel treatment and torture of @entity11 and reports that there are attempts to arrest him from his hospital bed , " she said in a statement			1
" this is completely unacceptable and must stop immediately			2
" military calls for stability these comments came as @entity6 president @entity99 signed into law friday a bill that would grant amnesty to scores of political prisoners now detained			1
but it appeared to be a moot move , given that the opposition -- whose allies , theoretically , would be the ones freed -- have n't backed it			2
they questioned the requirement that protesters vacate seized government buildings and unblock streets before amnesty is granted			1
in fact , the protesters camped out on the bitter cold streets of the capital , @entity121 , did n't budge after the amnesty law went into effect			1
their demands , too , have n't changed : for wider constitutional reforms and shifting more power away from the president and onto the @entity128			1
they have been in @entity121 's @entity130 , or @entity130 , since november , when the president reversed a decision to sign a long - awaited trade deal with the @entity80 and turned instead toward @entity134			1
the protests turned violent after @entity99 's party rammed a controversial anti-protest law through @entity128 two weeks ago			1
at least four protesters and an unknown number of police also have been killed			0
thankfully , there have been no repeats of those violent confrontations since last week			0
on friday , @entity6 's military forces urged the president to restore stability , saying that a further escalation of the political unrest in the country threatens the @entity153 nation 's territorial integrity			1
@entity99 must take " immediate measures to stabilize the situation , " the country 's @entity154 said a statement			0
in an interview with @entity134 state news agency @entity161 on sunday , @entity6 defense minister @entity159 said that @entity6 military forces would not interfere in the country 's current political unrest			0
" the army will abide strictly by the constitution and laws of @entity6 that set clearly its role , functions and tasks , including use of armed forces , " @entity159 said			0
@entity153 leaders call for ' immediate dialogue ' @entity99 on thursday defended his government 's handling of the political crisis , saying that it had " fulfilled all its obligations " and that opposition leaders were stoking people 's anger for their own gain			1
his office had earlier said he was out on sick leave			0
former @entity6 president @entity185 told @entity187 's @entity186 on thursday that the opposition does not have full control of the street protests that have shaken the country			1
the opposition , he said through a translator , has n't provided a " comprehensive pact " that would satisfy protesters ' demands			1
according to @entity185 , the opposition is concerned about " the fight for power , " but less with " the strategic course of the country			0
" opposition politicians have called for @entity99 also to stand down , but he has not given any indication he will do so			0
speaking at a joint news conference in @entity206 on friday with @entity208 president @entity207 , @entity204 prime minister @entity203 appealed for a peaceful resolution to the crisis			0
" we are concerned about the violence in @entity6			0
the repeal of restrictions on fundamental freedoms was a step in the right direction , and we urge president @entity99 to respect his people 's wishes and put his country back on a path to a more stable and secure @entity153 future , " @entity203 said			2
" on @entity6 , we are calling to an immediate dialogue without violence , " @entity207 said .			0
