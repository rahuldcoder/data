-- for years tech pundits have been searching for an " @entity7 " killer -- a mythical new device that would dethrone @entity5 's mighty handset as the most admired or popular smartphone			1
it may be already here			0
for the first time , @entity10 's @entity9 overtook @entity5 's @entity12 to become the world 's best - selling smartphone model for the third quarter ( july through september ) of 2012 , according to new research by @entity17			1
the @entity9 shipped 18 million units worldwide , compared with 16.2 million for the @entity12			2
that 's 11 % of all smartphones shipped on the planet			0
yes , this is the phone in those mocking tv ads that show annoying fanboys and fangirls in a thinly disguised @entity5 store line , obsessing over their impending purchase while a happy @entity9 owner saves a place in line ... for his parents			2
released in may , the @entity33 - based @entity9 boasts a bigger touchscreen and longer battery life than the @entity12 , along with more megapixels in its camera and the ability to run on @entity41 cellular networks			1
some tech sites have rated it the best smartphone on the market			0
but the @entity9 reign atop the sales rankings will likely be short - lived			0
as @entity17 pointed out , @entity12 sales waned in the third quarter as consumers waited for the @entity7 , which went on sale september 21			1
@entity5 sold 5 million @entity52 that first weekend and is expected to sell many millions more during this holiday shopping season .			0

@entity10 's @entity9 was the world 's best - selling smartphone in the third quarter
for the first time ever , it *surpassed* sales of the @entity12
but @entity5 will likely *reclaim* the sales crown next quarter with the new @entity7
