-- a @entity2 man authorities say once pondered changing his name to @entity5 to honor his personal heroes -- @entity7 and @entity8 -- remained jailed monday on bomb - related charges in what police described as a plot to attack police , military personnel and postal facilities			1
police arrested @entity17 , 27 , on sunday at the apartment of a confidential informant in the case when a video camera showed him drilling holes in pipes that would become the casings for bombs , according to a criminal complaint			1
@entity17 allegedly told police he was an hour away from completing his first bomb when he was arrested , according to the complaint			1
" @entity17 's behavior morphed from simply talking about such acts to actions -- namely , bomb making , " @entity2 police commissioner @entity29 said			1
while serious , the charges against @entity17 are a far cry from the mass - casualty attacks that have been @entity39 's hallmark , and his case may reflect the weakened nature of the terrorist organization in the wake of the death of many top leaders , @entity0 security analyst @entity34 said			1
" if this is the big threat that we face , lone wolves using @entity49 recipes , we 're in a pretty good place , " @entity34 said			0
@entity17 was arraigned sunday night in a @entity2 court on state charges of possession of a bomb for terrorism , conspiracy as a crime of terrorism , soliciting support for a terrorist act , being a felon in possession of a weapon and conspiracy to commit criminal mischief and arson , according to the criminal complaint			1
he planned to attack police officers , patrol cars and service members returning from service abroad , mayor @entity70 said			1
" the suspect was a so - called lone wolf , motivated by his own resentment of the presence of @entity80 troops in @entity81 and @entity82 , as well as inspired by @entity39 propaganda , " @entity70 said			1
" he was not part of a larger conspiracy emanating from abroad			1
" @entity2 authorities have communicated with federal authorities , but even though @entity17 's alleged targets were federal troops and facilities , his case will be handled in @entity2 courts , manhattan district attorney @entity86 said			1
@entity17 's attorney , @entity94 , said the case against his client is nowhere near as strong as authorities say			1
" as they admit , he has a very public online profile , and that flies in the face of everything that they 've said , " @entity94 said at the hearing			0
" this is not the way you go about committing terrorist attacks			0
" @entity17 , also known as @entity109 , according to the criminal complaint , had a " very active and very public online profile , " prosecutors said			2
they cited the website @entity113			0
after his arrest , @entity17 told police that he believes @entity117 law requires @entity117 to wage war against the @entity80 , including assassinations , according to the criminal complaint against him			1
@entity17 's mother , @entity121 , said her family is in shock over the allegations			1
" i 'm upset about what my son did , but on the other hand , he 's my son , " she said			2
" i still love my son			0
i love the son i know , maybe a lot of people do n't know			0
" a neighbor , @entity132 , said @entity17 was nice but " did n't seem like normal			2
" still nothing stood out to make him or his wife particularly suspicious of @entity17 , he said			2
" it 's really shocking because i have two daughters in the building			2
it 's like making me think that this is an unsafe place , " he said			2
@entity17 's uncle @entity140 told @entity0 affiliate @entity141 that his sister 's son lived with him and that he had no idea what his nephew was up to inside his bedroom , which he always kept locked			1
@entity29 said @entity17 is a follower of @entity148 , the radical @entity80 - born cleric who rose to become a top figure in @entity150 before a @entity80 drone strike killed him this year in @entity152			1
he allegedly tried to contact @entity148 directly before the cleric 's death , but never got a response , according to officials			2
in august , the suspect allegedly decided to carry out the bomb plot , @entity29 said			2
he " jacked up his speed " after @entity148 's death on september 30 , according to the police commissioner			2
" we knew for the last two years , he 's been reading a lot of jihadist information and talked a lot of inflammatory rhetoric , " @entity29 said of @entity17			1
" but it appears at this juncture the death of @entity148 motivated him and made him increase his tempo			0
" he had also sought to visit @entity152 for training , according to authorities			0
@entity17 bought ingredients at @entity174 and other stores for the three bombs that he was working to make , mindful to shop around so as not to " raise red flags , " according to the police commissioner			1
he allegedly planned to test an explosive device in a mailbox before using it against other targets			0
his aim , the police commissioner said , was to show there were " mujahedin " -- or @entity117 militants -- in the city ready to wage " jihad			0
" at the news conference announcing @entity17 's arrest , authorities showed a video of a car being destroyed by a bomb they built according to the instructions the suspect allegedly was following			1
but @entity34 said it 's not clear that @entity17 could have built a device that would have exploded with the same force , given that several would - be bombers failed to build devices that successfully detonated			1
" building a bomb from a recipe off the @entity49 does n't mean you 're going to build a bomb that does what we saw on the video , " @entity34 said			0
an unemployed native of the @entity212 @entity211 and a @entity80 citizen , @entity17 had lived most of his life in @entity215 , except for five years in @entity216 , @entity2			1
authorities had monitored him since 2009 , and his extreme positions " made even some of his like - minded friends nervous , " said @entity29			0
the commissioner said @entity17 even talked about changing his name to @entity5 -- in honor of his now deceased " heroes " @entity7 and @entity5 , the @entity81 dictator			2
he allegedly learned how to make a pipe bomb after reading an article entitled " how to make a bomb in the kitchen of your @entity231 " in @entity233 , an online @entity234 published by @entity150			0
the issue that came out just before @entity148 's death emphasized that @entity39 supporters in the @entity238 should take matters into their own hands and launch attacks themselves			0
" he was a reader of @entity39 's slick online magazine @entity233 -- and inspire him it did , " @entity86 said			0
" his stated desire to attack our servicemen and women ... could have come from an @entity39 playbook			0
" @entity0 national security analyst @entity249 said it seemed odd that federal authorities were not involved in the case , particularly given the targets			0
" the feds may have been able to help here , " she said			0
" that being said , they had a successful arrest , and we 'll see what we can learn from it			0
" @entity0 's @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 contributed to this report .			0
