after scoring 12 goals in their opening two @entity3 fixtures , @entity1 had to settle for just two at @entity9 on saturday			0
goals in either half from @entity12 and @entity13 -- the @entity15 's fourth goal this season came from the penalty spot -- was enough to see off @entity5 and gives the @entity19 champions a two point lead at the top of the table after only three games			0
having secured their passage to the @entity27 group stages in midweek , @entity24 returned to @entity28 with a bump against @entity30 losing 0 - 1 at @entity31			1
it was a far cry from last season when @entity35 's side thrashed @entity30 9 - 1 in the corresponding fixture			1
a late goal from @entity38 secured @entity30 's first points of the season , and will surely lift some of the early season gloom engulfing @entity43 's men who shipped 10 goals without reply in their opening two matches			2
@entity47 scored @entity49 's winner as they overcame @entity50 1 - 2 at @entity51			1
@entity52 gave the @entity53 the lead after 20 minutes shooting past former @entity56 goalkeeper , @entity55			0
but @entity50 equalized seven minutes later when striker @entity57 slotted home from close range			2
despite having most of the possession , @entity49 found another goal hard to come by			0
but a typically robust @entity50 side were undone when @entity47 's low shot found a route to goal through a crowd of @entity50 shirts , to seal the three points			1
the victory lifts @entity49 to 2nd in the table			2
@entity71 cruised to a 3 - 0 victory over @entity73 at @entity74			1
@entity75 opened the scoring after 33 minutes -- and his account for the season -- when he converted from the penalty spot after @entity80 had been fouled by @entity73 's @entity81			0
@entity82 and @entity83 added two more goals in the second half			0
the result lifts @entity88 's team to third in the table , level on points with @entity49			0
meanwhile , @entity73 remain at the bottom of the table without a win to their name and a goal difference of minus eight			0
@entity99 's @entity98 side were moments away from their first home win of the season against @entity103 only to be denied by a late equalizer from @entity105			1
striker @entity106 gave @entity108 ' side the lead after 35 minutes , but @entity98 struck back with two goals in five minutes midway through the second half courtesy of an own goal from @entity113 , followed by a low drive from @entity98 's on - loan striker @entity116			2
the result means @entity98 remain one point and one place ahead of @entity103 in the table in 10th spot			1
@entity122 and @entity123 drew 1 - 1 in a tight game at @entity125			1
@entity126 gave the home side the lead shortly before half time			0
but in - form striker @entity129 equalized for @entity123 after 62 minutes when he headed home a @entity132 free - kick			1
the draw keeps @entity122 ( five points ) a point ahead of @entity123 in the table			2
sunday 's fixtures see @entity138 take on @entity139 , @entity141 travel to @entity142 , @entity144 host @entity143 , while @entity145 and @entity146 face each other at the @entity148 .			0
