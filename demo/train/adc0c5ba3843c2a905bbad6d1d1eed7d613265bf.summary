chances are you 're reading this while leaning over a table or slumped back in a chair			2
your head is tilted forward ; your shoulders are curved			2
if you 're on a mobile device , your arms are bent by your side and your back hunch is even more profound			1
am i right ? the position you 're in is probably causing you pain , whether you 're aware of it yet or not			1
do n't worry , physical therapists have a diagnosis for the headaches , neck cricks and achy shoulders			1
they call it " @entity22			1
" " @entity22 is not just a texting problem , " says dr. @entity23			1
" text neck is a gaming problem			2
text neck is an e-mailing problem			2
" @entity23 originally coined the term in 2008 while examining a 17 - year - old patient			1
the teen came in complaining of headaches and neck pain			1
as @entity23 was trying to explain to the patient 's mother exactly what the problem was , he glanced over and saw her posture			1
the teen was sitting in a chair , hunched over her smartphone , texting away			2
" i knew i had something , " @entity23 says			1
the average human head weighs 10 pounds in a neutral position -- when your ears are over your shoulders			0
for every inch you tilt your head forward , the pressure on your spine doubles			0
so if you 're looking at a smartphone in your lap , your neck is holding up what feels like 20 or 30 pounds			0
sleeping with your smartphone ? all that extra pressure puts a strain on your spine and can pull it out of alignment			0
dr. @entity60 , president of the @entity62 's @entity61 , compares it to bending your finger back all the way and holding it there for an hour			1
" as you stretch the tissue for a long period of time , it gets sore , it gets inflamed , " @entity60 says			0
" the real question ... is ' what are the long term effects going to be ? ' " staying in what experts call the " forward head posture " can lead to muscle strain , disc herniations and pinched nerves			1
over time , it can even flatten or reverse the natural curve of your neck			0
as your mother used to say : be careful or it might stay like that			0
dr. @entity86 , director of @entity87 in @entity88 , says she started seeing patients with head , neck and back pain caused by mobile devices six or seven years ago			1
recently she says @entity22 has increased dramatically , especially among her younger patients			1
according to the @entity96 , 8 - to 18 - year - olds spend an average of seven and a half hours using " entertainment media " every day			0
but it 's not just kids			0
the average amount of data used on a smartphone tripled from 2010 to 2011 , according to @entity105 's @entity104			0
and each tablet generates 3.4 times more traffic than the average smartphone			0
not only does forward head posture cause nerve pain , @entity109 says it can also create metabolic problems			1
try to take a deep breath in a slumped position			0
now sit up straight and try again			0
experts say slouching can reduce the capacity of your lungs by as much as 30 %			2
a lack of oxygenated blood flowing through the body can potentially lead to vascular disease			0
and gastrointestinal problems can be caused by pressure placed on the organs in a bad posture			1
so what 's an ipad - cradling , smartphone - texting , laptop - loving guy or gal to do ? first , @entity109 says , is to be aware of your body			2
keep your feet flat on the floor , roll your shoulders back and keep your ears directly over them so your head is n't tilted forward			0
use a docking station and wrist guards to support the weight of a mobile device			2
@entity23 's @entity145 created a mobile app to help you remember to avoid forward head posture			1
when your @entity150 phone ( the app is not yet available on @entity152 ) is held at a safe viewing angle , a green light shines in the top left corner			0
when you 're at risk for @entity22 , a red light appears			1
optional vibrations or beeps can be added as a warning			0
most important , the physical therapists agree , is taking frequent breaks while using any mobile device or desktop computer			1
about every 20 minutes , stand up , roll your shoulders and neck or go for a short walk to improve blood flow			0
when you return , check out more stories in our @entity173 series			0
