" we all know there are decent , honorable , brave police officers out in our communities every single day , " @entity29 said , before telling the audience the fact that @entity77 males are more likely to end up in prison than their white counterparts was a byproduct of an " out of balance " criminal justice system			1
" each of us has to grapple with some hard truths about race and justice in @entity64 , " @entity29 said			1
" we have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance			1
and i personally hope that these tragedies give us the opportunity to come together as a nation to find our balance again			0

we are better than that			0
" on thursday , @entity29 said in light of sweeping protests , people need to try " even harder to see the world through our neighbors eyes			1
" " are n't these our sons ? are n't these our brothers ? " @entity29 asked			2
" these tragedies did not happen in some far away place			0
they did not happen to some other people			0
there are our streets , our children			0
" the venue for the commentary was somewhat unique			0
in a hall the size of multiple football fields , 10,000 women ate lunch and listened to @entity29 talk at the @entity137			1
outside the convention center hall a mix of corporations and shops were set up in booths to create what felt like a mix of a job fair and a mall			0
women shopped for make up , scarfs and jewelry as they handed out resumes and got coached on how to buff up their @entity152 page			0
around the hall , there was excitement for @entity29			2
many women chatted about her time on the speaking circuit and whether she would drop hints about her presidential plans on stage			2
@entity164 president @entity163 , who founded the gathering 10 years ago , event pondered the subject from stage			0
