-- this week @entity1 went on " the @entity2 with @entity3 " -- clean - shaven and once again good - looking -- to apologize for the stunt he pulled when he appeared on the show in character for the flick " @entity9			1
" @entity1 assured us that @entity3 was not in on the joke			1
but it got us thinking -- why is " @entity3 " the place celebrities go to unleash their crazy ? do they drug stars in the green room ? or does @entity3 make people feel so uncomfortable that they let out their inner freak ? who knows ? but we rounded up the 10 most insane @entity3 interviews in our recent memory			1
the @entity0 : 9 celebrities try to explain why they cheated @entity1 starting , of course , with @entity1 's february 2009 interview , during which he revealed that he was retiring from acting and embarking on a rap career			1
his shaggy beard , sunglasses at night , one - word answers to questions , and overall twiggy , skittish behavior had us seriously worried			1
@entity32 flashed @entity3 @entity33 seems so together these days that it 's easy to forget that she was once a total mess			1
case in point : her 1995 interview with @entity3			1
it 's hard to believe that she was n't on anything when she revealed that her birthday usually makes her nauseous and talked about how liberating stripping is			2
then @entity32 jumped on the desk and proceeded to flash @entity3			1
@entity46 made us cringe a year earlier , @entity46 made quite a spectacle of herself on " @entity3			1
" after berating @entity3 for being so interested in her sex life and calling him a " sick [ expletive ] , " she said , " are n't you going to smell them ? i gave him my underpants and he wo n't smell them			1
" this was during her @entity56 phase , when she was rocking black hair and combat boots , and more attitude			2
the @entity0 : 12 celebs who deny getting breast implants despite radical pics 4			0
@entity63 was acting weird in 1997 , @entity64 appeared on the cover of @entity66 and did a @entity67 special called " @entity68			0
" and she made an appearance on " @entity3 , " which she was late for because there were " people , lots of people			1
" she revealed that she and her mother had to have conceived on the same day , since their children have the same birthday			0
but the best moment was when she got totally confused and paused for a while			0
i really thought i was looking out the window , " she said , before giggling compulsively			0
@entity85 's awkward interview @entity86 was so cute and innocent in " @entity87			2
" but he ruined it all when he appeared on " @entity3 " in 1987 to promote his movie " @entity90			1
" and it was n't just the bad wig , ' 70s shirt , striped pants , and platform shoes that turned the world off			0
" i 'm a movie star , " he declared , awkwardly			0
then he challenged @entity3 to an arm - wrestling match			1
the @entity0 : 10 stars with bad body habits 6			0
@entity100 squirmed in 2007 , @entity101 went on " @entity3 " after her stint in the slammer and the whole thing was just uncomfortable			1
" how 'd you like being in jail ? " @entity3 asked , just a few seconds in			1
" not too much , " she replied			0
yes , he also asked about the food			0
" it 's not supposed to be good -- it 's jail , " she said			0
@entity111 was defensive is n't it weird that @entity111 looks younger now ( see the recent @entity114 show , anyone ? ) than she did in her 1986 " @entity3 " interview ? for her 1996 appearance , she kept her hands firmly across her chest			1
when @entity3 asked why she refused to come on the show for years and then relented , @entity111 explained , " i want to pay my hotel bill			1
i have a huge hotel bill			1
i thought i 'd come on and see what this guy is like			0
" so what did she think ? " you 're an [ insert a not - so - nice - name for ' jerk ' ]			2
@entity130 pulled a " @entity32 " nearly a decade later , @entity131 went on " @entity3 " wearing almost the same ensemble that @entity33 sported on the show			1
before she even sat down , she flashed him			2
then she did it again and again , before falling off a chair			0
" i learned how to flirt from watching @entity3 flirt with @entity136			1
it has been the crisis of all my dysfunctional relationships ever since , " she said			0
the @entity0 : 13 @entity141 guys who fell for regular gals 9			0
@entity144 's big joke @entity144 is n't known for his straight interviews			0
in 1982 , he appeared on " @entity3 " with wrestler @entity146			2
why ? because part of @entity149 's shtick was wrestling women , and as such , @entity146 challenged him to a match			0
during the interview , @entity146 slaps @entity149 , which leads to a tirade worthy of a " @entity155			2
" we 'll never know if this whole bit was staged			0
borat bombed we know what to expect from @entity160 when he 's in character as @entity162 , but @entity3 did n't seem prepared			2
seems he thought he was getting an interview with @entity160 proper			2
when @entity3 asked about @entity160 's wife , he was no doubt referring to @entity167			2
but @entity160 responded , " my wife is dead			0
when i buy my wife , she was very nice , she cook good , she was strong on plow			0
but after three years when she was 15 , her voice got deep and she grow much hair on chest			0
" @entity3 was not amused			2

why is " @entity3 " the place celebrities go to unleash their crazy ?
