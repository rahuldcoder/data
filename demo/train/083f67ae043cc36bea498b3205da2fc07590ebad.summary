-- @entity2 , accused of killing her 2 - year - old daughter @entity2 in 2008 , was determined competent to proceed with her capital murder trial after she was examined by three psychologists over the weekend , the judge said monday			1
the psychologists ' reports will be sealed , said @entity8 chief judge @entity7 outside the presence of the jury			1
" based on privileged communications between @entity16 and her counsel , counsel reasonably believes that ms. @entity16 is not competent to aid and assist in her own defense and is incompetent to proceed , " said the motion , filed by defense attorneys saturday under seal and made public monday			1
" as a result of this well - founded concern , counsel requests a full competency determination before the continuation of trial proceedings			2
" it was implied -- but not expressly stated -- that the motion was the reason for the abrupt recess @entity7 called on saturday morning			1
@entity27 , 25 , is charged with seven counts , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading police , in her daughter 's death			1
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against her			0
@entity27 's defense team is trying to discredit the prosecution theory that the @entity41 woman rendered @entity2 unconscious with chloroform , duct - taped her mouth and nose , and stored the body in her car trunk for a few days before dumping it in the woods			1
the defense says @entity2 accidentally drowned in the family pool and that @entity27 and her father , @entity51 , panicked and covered it up			1
@entity27 has denied that theory			1
@entity27 's defense attorneys also filed a motion monday asking @entity7 to reconsider an earlier decision and declare @entity58 's death penalty law unconstitutional			1
the motion cites a june 20 decision by @entity61 district judge @entity60 , which found the method used to reach a death sentence in @entity58 is improper " because it does not require a jury to make the findings of fact necessary to impose a death sentence			1
" @entity27 's attorneys had previously filed a motion asking for the statute to be declared unconstitutional , and @entity7 denied it			1
after the @entity60 decision , they are asking him to reconsider			0
" because @entity58 's death penalty procedure is unconstitutional , the death penalty should be precluded as a potential sentence , " according to the motion			2
in the case @entity60 ruled on , @entity78 v. @entity79 , the jury recommended a sentence of death on a 9 - 3 vote but did not say on which aggravating factors it based the decision			0
a motion to alter or amend has been filed in the case -- basically a motion asking @entity60 to reconsider			2
jurors heard monday from two men who worked for @entity2 's parents , @entity51 and @entity2 , after @entity2 's disappearance on june 16 , 2008			1
private investigators @entity92 and @entity94 both said they provided security services at the @entity27 home from " protesters " who would show up			2
@entity92 said he was working as a citizen although he is a licensed private investigator			0
the two said they spent two days in november 2008 searching a wooded area for @entity2 's body			1
the search site was near where the remains were found a month later			2
a videotape of that search was played for jurors			1
@entity94 told defense attorney @entity109 the search was prompted by a phone tip he received from a psychic			2
both defense attorney @entity112 and prosecutor @entity113 accused @entity92 of attempting to cash in on his association with the case by trying to sell the tape of the search , but he denied that , saying he actually thought he had taped over the search and only discovered later he had not			2
he did say he at one point was going to sell some photographs of the search and give the money to @entity94 and the @entity121			2
" i did n't need it , " he said			0
jurors also heard from @entity124 , a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at @entity126 and director emeritus of the university 's @entity128			2
@entity124 testified that he studies chemicals emitted by both live and dead people			0
chloroform can be given off in small amounts by a decomposing body			0
one prosecution expert , @entity135 of @entity137 's @entity136 , described the levels of the substance in the trunk of @entity27 's white @entity141 as " shockingly high			1
" several witnesses also testified for the state about odors that they said smelled like the unmistakable scent of human decomposition			0
@entity124 said there are alternative explanations for the chloroform found in the trunk , noting the compound is found in a number of household items , particularly bleach			0
on his cross-examination , prosecutor @entity155 held up the black spare tire cover from @entity27 's trunk			1
@entity124 acknowledged that if bleach had been poured directly on the carpet , the cover would have showed some evidence of that			0
also , @entity124 said , the chemical reactions that produce chloroform also produce other substances			0
testing was not done to determine whether any of those substances were present , he said -- either by him or by the @entity136 laboratory			0
@entity124 said there is no instrumentation that can record with scientific validity the presence or absence of human decomposition , and said his studies suggest there are chemical compounds unique to human decomposition that were not present in @entity135 ' analysis of the air samples from the trunk			0
on cross-examination , however , he acknowledged that a decomposing human body would explain the presence of the compounds that @entity135 found , but @entity124 said a bag of garbage that was left in the trunk for weeks could have contributed			0
before a lunch break , @entity124 testified that the @entity136 laboratory should have done a quantitative analysis to determine how much chloroform was present in the trunk in order to state its importance			0
@entity197 detective @entity196 , the lead investigator in the case , was also recalled to the stand monday			0
@entity112 questioned @entity196 in an effort to cast doubt on the thoroughness of the investigation			0
under questioning , @entity196 acknowledged that he did not subpoena @entity27 's cell tower records , showing where he was when calls were made or received			1
asked whether that might have helped investigators , @entity196 said it would have , " if i had had a reason to believe it would play a part in this case , which at the time i did not			0
" he said he also did not seize a computer belonging to @entity216 , the meter reader who discovered @entity2 's remains in a wooded area near the @entity27 home on december 11 , 2008			1
@entity196 testified he had no reason to do so			0
@entity196 also said that cadaver dogs were not deployed on @entity51 and @entity2 's cars , only on @entity2 's			1
on cross-examination , @entity113 asked @entity196 whether anyone ever reported that either of those cars smelled like a dead body , and he said they did not			0
monday marks the beginning of the sixth week of testimony in the trial , which began with opening statements on may 24			2
@entity7 originally told jurors , who are being housed in an @entity41 hotel shielded from media coverage of the trial , that the trial could last six to eight weeks			2
on friday -- before saturday 's delay -- @entity112 said he expected the defense to rest on wednesday or possibly thursday			1
that would leave room for a rebuttal case from the prosecution and closing statements before the @entity246 holiday			0
saturday was planned as a full day in the trial , and it was unclear how the day 's delay would affect those plans			1
testimony on monday lasted until after 7 p.m. @entity2 was not reported missing to police until july 15 , 2008 , when @entity2 , tracked down her daughter @entity94 and demanded answers regarding @entity2 's whereabouts			1
prosecution witnesses described @entity2 's behavior in the month after @entity2 was last seen as nonchalant , testifying that she spent time with her boyfriend , went shopping and to nightclubs -- but told no one her daughter was missing			1
they testified they noticed no change in her demeanor			0
@entity112 said in his opening statement that @entity27 behaved as she did because years of sexual abuse by her father had conditioned her to conceal the truth and hide her pain			2
@entity27 has denied the claims that he abused his daughter or helped conceal his granddaughter 's death			1
in @entity277 's @entity276 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 contributed to this report			0
watch @entity279 monday through sunday starting at 8 p.m. et on @entity280			0
