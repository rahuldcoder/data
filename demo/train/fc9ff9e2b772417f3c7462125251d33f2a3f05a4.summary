@entity1 's new defense white paper has done little to mend fences with @entity3 , with the @entity5 government complaining that its @entity7 neighbor is using the " @entity10 threat " to justify a bigger defense budget			1
@entity1 will spend about $ 49 billion on defense in the fiscal year to march 2015 -- up about 3 % from the previous year -- in the face of what it says is a worsening security environment in the region			1
it cites tensions on the @entity19 and territorial disputes in the sea lanes running south from northern @entity7 as its key concerns			0
under prime minister @entity24 , @entity1 is becoming more assertive about its defense posture , and is looking to upgrade its military over the next four years with bigger helicopter carriers , more anti-submarine patrol aircraft , surveillance drones , better amphibious warfare capability , and first deliveries in 2018 of its new fifth - generation fighter , the @entity35 - made @entity34			1
in terms of regional defense , @entity1 benefits substantially from its security alliance with the @entity35 , and is a big buyer of @entity35 - made weaponry			2
it also builds its own submarines , surface ships and fighter variants			0
@entity10 , which will likely spend about $ 200 billion this financial year on defense -- second only to the @entity35 -- is a significant buyer of @entity47 aircraft , ships and submarines , but is concentrating on its own domestic capabilities			1
it launched its first aircraft carrier in late 2012 , with two more likely to be built by the end of this decade			0
it is also developing its own fifth - generation stealth fighter , the twin - engined @entity56 , with the first deployment expected in 2018			0
dangerous activities @entity1 's annual defense document , approved by the @entity24 cabinet on august 5 , says @entity5 ships and aircraft have engaged in " dangerous activities " in disputed areas such as the @entity10 and @entity65 , and these could have " unintended consequences			1
" @entity10 's @entity67 quickly rejected the @entity69 claim , calling it simply an excuse for @entity1 's own military expansion			1
it said it strongly opposed @entity1 's " ignorance of facts " and its " groundless accusations " about @entity10 's military development			1
@entity1 says @entity10 needs to be more transparent about the reasons behind what @entity78 calls a " broad and rapid " buildup of @entity5 military might			1
it says @entity10 has n't been clear about the rationale for its expansion			2
in the air , @entity10 already has more frontline fighters than @entity1 , with the @entity5 combat arsenal including advanced @entity47 @entity87 and su - 30 planes , and the domestic @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
@entity1 has about 260 planes , including about 200 @entity93 , its mainstay fighter			2
qualitatively , @entity1 still is seen to have an edge because of its close integration with the @entity1 - based @entity35 military forces , in areas such as early warning , electronic warfare and refueling			2
by 2018 , that air superiority could tilt to @entity10 , depending on how smoothly the roll - out proceeds respectively for @entity10 's @entity56 and the @entity69 variant of the @entity105			1
@entity35 pivot for the @entity35 , the @entity10 - @entity1 defense spending spat is another point of @entity110 regional tension			1
the administration of @entity35 president @entity112 wants to expand and maintain good relations with @entity10 , but is mindful that @entity1 hosts most of the key @entity35 forward bases in the region			1
plus there is a powerful economic incentive : @entity110 continues to be a major focus of arms sales for the @entity35 , in competition with @entity47 , some @entity122 suppliers , and @entity10 itself			0
according to the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) , global military spending last year was about $ 1.75 trillion , with the top 15 nations accounting for about $ 1.4 trillion of that			0
it ascribed a figure of $ 640 billion to the @entity35 in 2013 , followed by @entity10 on $ 188 billion			1
@entity47 ranked third , with a 2013 spend of about $ 88 billion , ahead of @entity129 ( $ 67 billion ) , @entity130 ( $ 61 billion ) , @entity131 ( $ 58 billion ) , and @entity132 ( $ 48.8 billion )			0
@entity1 , @entity133 and @entity134 ranked 8th , 9th and 10th in 2013 , according to @entity124 's calculations			0
@entity35 military spending declined in 2013 and is budgeted to fall again in the year to september 2014 to about $ 526 billion			2
in contrast , @entity124 says that @entity10 , @entity47 and @entity129 have more than doubled their military spending since 2004			0
territorial spat @entity10 and @entity1 have a long - standing territorial dispute in the @entity141 over a group of islands known in @entity1 as the @entity144 and in @entity10 as the @entity145			2
the islands lie about 111 miles ( 180 kilometers ) northeast of @entity147 and about 248 miles ( 400 kilometers ) west of @entity148			0
the area has seen a number of air and sea confrontations in recent years -- a point highlighted in the @entity69 defense white paper			0
it says : " @entity10 has intruded into @entity69 territorial waters frequently and violated @entity1 's airspace by its government ships and aircraft belonging to maritime law - enforcement agencies , and has engaged in dangerous activities that could cause unintended consequences , such as its vessel 's direction of a fire control radar at a @entity167 destroyer , the flight of fighters abnormally close to @entity171 aircraft , and its announcement of establishing the ' @entity173 ' based on its own assertion thereby infringing the freedom of overflight over the high seas			1
" in response , a @entity179 spokesperson said on august 8 that there was " nothing disputable " about @entity10 carrying out " normal maritime and air activities which are consistent with international laws and relevant domestic laws and regulations			0
" the spokesperson said @entity10 was exercising its legitimate rights and interests in establishing the @entity190 , and was " in conformity with international laws and common practices			0
" @entity1 also has a territorial dispute with @entity134 over the @entity196 / @entity196 group of islands in the @entity1 / @entity198			0
@entity134 complained that the @entity69 defense white paper included the disputed islets as @entity69 territory and called on @entity1 to withdraw what it termed an " unjust claim			2
" further south , in the @entity204 , @entity10 is in dispute with @entity206 , the @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity147 over competing claims to various islets and rocky outcrops .			0

@entity1 will spend about $ 49 billion on defense in the fiscal year to march 2015
compares with the $ 200 billion @entity10 will likely spend on defense
under prime minister @entity24 , @entity1 is becoming more assertive about its defense posture
@entity10 's @entity67 says defense paper is an excuse for @entity1 's military expansion
