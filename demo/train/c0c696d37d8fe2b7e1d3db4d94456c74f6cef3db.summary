@entity0 -- nearly 16 years after a fuel tank explosion destroyed @entity4 , killing all 230 aboard , the @entity2 on friday proposed to fine @entity5 $ 13.57 million for failing to meet a deadline intended to prevent similar catastrophes			1
the @entity2 said @entity5 failed to meet a 2010 deadline to give airlines information on how to reduce fuel tank flammability , missing the deadline by 301 days for its b - 747 aircraft , and by 406 days for its b - 757 planes			1
because of the missed deadline , airlines have asked the @entity2 for extensions to make necessary fixes , the @entity2 said			1
the @entity2 said it is considering extending a deadline requiring airlines to retrofit half of their aircraft by 2014 , but will not extend a 2017 deadline to retrofit all impacted aircraft			1
some 383 @entity5 aircraft in the @entity28 are affected by the delays , it said			2
" we take this matter very seriously , " said acting @entity2 administrator @entity30			2
" we have issued hundreds of directives to eliminate fuel ignition sources over the past 16 years , and this step will add another layer of safety			0
" in a two - page letter to @entity5 on friday , the @entity2 proposed the fine of $ 13,574,400			1
@entity40 , a @entity5 spokesman , said friday in a statement that the company is " committed " to continuing efforts to provide a solution to the problem			2
" @entity5 has since provided the service instructions to the @entity2 concerning the out - of - production aircraft that are the subject of the proposed penalty , " the statement said			1
" in compliance with the rule changes , @entity5 has already included a @entity52 in the basic design on the 747 - 8 and 787			0
the system is being installed on all @entity5 airplanes currently in production ( 737 , 747 - 8 , 767 , 777 and 787 ) and is available for retrofit on all other out - of - production models			0
the system is currently in service on 1,805 @entity5 airplanes around the world			0
" the july 17 , 1996 , explosion of @entity4 , a @entity5 747 , was one of the deadliest accidents in aviation history , and was among the most difficult to solve			1
although it was originally feared the explosion over the @entity71 near @entity72 , @entity73 , may have been downed by terrorists , @entity68 investigators eventually concluded that a short in some electrical lines ignited the volatile fuel - air mixture in the plane 's nearly empty center - wing fuel tank			1
the @entity4 case illustrates the slow process of identifying and correcting dangerous systems on sophisticated aircraft			0
by the time all jetliners are retrofitted with safety systems in 2017 , two decades will have passed since the initial accident			0
the @entity2 has itself come under fire for the slow pace of change			0
in 2005 , the @entity68 criticized the @entity2 , saying there had been little progress in making aircraft safer from fuel tank explosions			1
" the stark reality is that on a fleet - wide basis , on the flammability side we are no different today than we were in 1996 , " the @entity68 said at the time			0
on friday , the @entity2 took the offensive , saying @entity5 had failed to meet deadlines			1
the @entity2 said that since the @entity100 accident , it has issued 283 directives to prevent the ignition of vapors in and around commercial aircraft fuel tanks			2
in january 2010 , @entity5 committed to providing instructions for @entity2 approval for airline mechanics by december of that year			2
the instructions were to explain how to install systems that would replace the oxygen in airplane fuel tanks with non-flammable nitrogen gas , reducing the risk of explosion			0
but it missed those deadlines , the @entity2 said			0
the @entity2 said @entity115 , the other aircraft manufacturer , met the deadline			2
@entity5 has 30 days to respond to the agency .			0

the @entity2 says @entity5 has failed to meet a deadline to prevent similar *crashes* as @entity4
the *flight* *crashed* in july 1996 after an explosion in the central fuel tank
@entity5 has *n't* yet given airlines information on how to reduce fuel tank flammability , @entity2 says
