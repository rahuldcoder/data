editor 's note : @entity2 is chief executive of @entity3 , a global management consulting firm , and the author of " @entity6 : a short guide to leading a @entity8 "			1
he writes a weekly column , how we work , for @entity12			2
@entity2 says @entity13 and @entity14 shared their humanity with us			1
@entity17 ( @entity18 ) -- last thursday my wife , @entity19 , flew to @entity21 , @entity22 , to see her grandmother , @entity23 , who had just suffered a debilitating stroke			2
@entity23 is 93 years old with few friends left			2
as she lay in a hospital bed barely able to speak , family members gathered around her to tell her they love her and to say goodbye			2
saying goodbye to a loved one is an intensely personal and emotional moment			2
the memories of time spent together linger as we feel the love , the sadness , the loss			2
the same day @entity19 gathered with her family , people around the world gathered -- in person and online -- to say goodbye to two outsized public figures to whom they felt connected : @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity13 brought us closer to life itself			1
we sang with him , danced with him and were amazed by his youthful exuberance and musical talent			1
he was the original ; i still remember watching " @entity52 " on @entity51 thinking , " maybe there is something to this music video thing			2
" he sold over 800 million albums and " @entity59 " is still the no. 1 selling album of all time			2
he was a young man with extraordinary talent			1
we loved him as a young man because he remained real , with his personality shining through his music			2
as he grew up , he grew away			2
from himself and from us			0
we lost touch with his humanness , his personality , his vulnerability			1
and when we could n't see that , we could n't see him			0
a few years ago , @entity71 , a motivational speaker who teaches about success in relationships , got divorced			0
people wondered if this would be the end of his career			1
would his audiences abandon him when they found out ? after all , how good was his advice if he could n't hold together his own marriage ? but when he spoke publicly about his divorce , people were amazingly supportive of him			1
the divorce , his failures , his vulnerabilities , did n't diminish him			0
we ca n't identify with perfection			1
we can admire it from afar , maybe aspire to it			0
but we ca n't relate to it because we know , deep down , that we ourselves are flawed			0
so we trust others who recognize that about themselves , too			0
@entity13 's tragedy was the second half of his life -- when he hid behind surgery and the high walls of @entity99			1
of course , trying to cover up his vulnerability was itself a vulnerability			1
but , in hiding , he lost himself			0
and so we lost him , too			0
that is the exact opposite of what @entity14 did			1
in the depths of a horrible , potentially embarrassing illness , @entity14 came out of hiding			1
when most of us would shoo the cameras away , she invited us in			0
she let us see her pain and suffering and fear and sadness			0
she let us see her self			0
so many of us fell in love with her all over again			0
not for her youthful beauty or her perfection or because she represented some ideal to which we aspired			0
no , we fell in love with her because we saw the real her			0
the raw , uncut , painful her			0
and in her , we saw ourselves			0
we fell in love with her because we identified with her			0
@entity14 's youthful beauty transformed through illness and suffering is a dark reminder of the inevitable progression of life , a reminder that we usually try to avoid			1
she herself tried to avoid aging for a while , with face - lifts and botox			0
and in her pursuit to retain her perfection , she began to lose us			0
but then she got real and reached out and we reached back			0
we reached back because of her vulnerability , not despite it			1
between my starting this article and finishing the final draft , @entity19 's grandmother @entity23 died			0
death is one of the few times in life when something is irrevocably taken from us			0
it 's impossible to go back and relive the period of our lives when she was with us , when she was younger , when we were younger			1
@entity149 moves only in one direction			0
and with her passing we are reminded of a time that has passed in our own lives , of moments we will never relive			1
it 's a little bit like that with @entity13 and @entity14			1
we feel something deep for them too			0
because they , too , touched our lives and changed us			1
they inspired us , excited us , empowered us			0
and with their passing , we are reminded of a part of our lives that is gone forever			1
both @entity13 and @entity14 caught our attention because of their particular gifts			1
but we care about them as people because they let us in , because they were human , real			2
it 's their vulnerability in the context of their power that was so impossible to resist , so compelling , so moving			2
that 's what @entity13 had and lost			1
and it 's what @entity14 lost and found			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : deaths of @entity13 and @entity14 touched many deeply
he says we identify with the vulnerability of people with fame and talent
@entity2 : as we *grieve* , we *'re* reminded of a part of our lives that is gone forever
