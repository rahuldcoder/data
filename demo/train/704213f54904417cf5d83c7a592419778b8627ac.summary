-- a potential deal that would reopen the federal government and stave off the prospect of a @entity5 debt default appears to barely touch the core of @entity7 , the health insurance program congressional @entity8 set out to cripple			1
although the terms of a deal that would end a two - week partial shutdown of federal offices and raise the government 's legal borrowing limit were n't final tuesday , @entity10 sources told @entity0 one possible change being weighed by @entity19 leaders could delay a fee on employers , unions and other health - plan sponsors that compensate insurance companies for taking on high - risk customers in the first year of the program set up under the @entity7			1
another could strengthen verification measures for people seeking federal subsidies to help them purchase health insurance required by the law			1
both of those are far short of the target set by conservative @entity8 in the @entity36 , who hoped to wipe out funding for @entity7 , as the program has become known			1
" this does n't , frankly , do a whole lot to @entity7 , " said @entity39 , director of the @entity40 's @entity41			1
the computerized insurance exchanges at the heart of the program have had a rocky rollout since they went live on october 1 , and there are some provisions that could stand to be fixed , @entity39 said			0
but he said those issues are being " overwhelmed " in the @entity51 push to eliminate it			2
how many have signed up for health care ? well , it depends getting rid of the $ 63 a head high - risk charge , known as the transitional reinsurance fee , is a proposal " that would deserve serious attention " in other circumstances , said @entity39 , co-author of a 2010 book on the politics of health care			1
states like @entity63 , which already has the largest catastrophic reinsurance program , are effectively double - taxed by the proposal			2
getting rid of it would mean the costs would be passed along to insurers and consumers , he said			0
" there are no states that are happy with it , " he said			0
but he said the fee is " more of a techie issue , to be honest			2
i 'm surprised it 's on people 's radar			2
" meanwhile , calling for tougher verification rules " is a little confusing , " @entity39 said			0
" the @entity79 has been working pretty hard on this , and with all the problems that the federal exchanges had in launching , this was not one of them , " he said			0
" that part of the process seems to be working pretty well , so i think this is more of a political thing in adding another level of protection , or red tape			0
i think from a policy perspective , the question is , what needed fixing ? " in the @entity36 , a @entity51 counterproposal floated tuesday morning would have suspended a tax on medical devices for two years and removed federal health care subsidies for legislators and top @entity101 administration officials			1
but the medical device tax provision had been dumped by tuesday afternoon , @entity36 @entity51 sources said			1
that levy is projected to raise about $ 29 billion over 10 years to subsidize health insurance programs , according to the nonpartisan @entity106			2
@entity39 said getting rid of it would leave a " crater " in the program 's finances and create " a kind of avalanche " as other health - care industries -- hospitals , drug manufacturers and insurers -- lined up for a similar reprieve			2
" i do n't think there are too many folks volunteering for that tour , " he said			2
if there 's a deal , what next ? the latest developments come less than two days before the @entity5 bumps up against its statutory debt ceiling , raising the risk that @entity127 would be short of funds to pay all of its bills in full and on time			0
and it comes on the 15th day of the partial government shutdown that has idled more than 800,000 federal workers and cost the economy an estimated $ 20 billion to date			0
the shutdown began after @entity137 passed a temporary spending bill that would have eliminated funding for @entity7 -- a bill swiftly rejected by the @entity10 - controlled @entity19			1
president @entity101 has insisted that @entity142 fund government operations and raise the debt ceiling without any " ransom , " and polls show public opinion turning sharply against the @entity51 as the standoff drags on			1
@entity51 leaders began to look for other concessions from @entity10 and the administration last week , and some -- particularly in the @entity19 -- have begun to criticize the colleagues who led them into the impasse			1
sen. @entity154 , @entity155 , told @entity0 's @entity156 that @entity8 have now wasted weeks " focused on something that was never going to happen			0
" " to be candidly candid , it 's an embarrassment to me that we have spent all this time on a rabbit trail , leading us to where we are , " @entity154 said			0
but rep. @entity162 , a tea party - backed @entity163 congressman , told @entity0 's the lead that he and many of his fellow @entity8 would be letting down their constituents if they did n't keep battling the @entity7			1
" i 'm a member of the @entity36			0
it 's a house of the people			0
we 're the voice of the people , " said @entity162 , who has also downplayed the potential impact of a government default			1
" i ran on defunding , burying and getting rid of @entity7 ... a lot of the members of our house , of our conference , ran on the same thing			1
so for us not to speak up is not to speak up for the @entity5 people			0
" hope for a smoother ride on @entity181 @entity0 's @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .			0

" this does n't , frankly , do a whole lot to @entity7 , " *analyst* says
@entity10 sources say a $ 63 - per - person fee on health plans could be dropped
" we 're the voice of the people , " @entity51 congressman says
but polls show *republicans* are taking the blame for the standoff
