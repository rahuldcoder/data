-- @entity2 's prime minister said tuesday he is happy to see the @entity3 and its @entity5 allies striking @entity7 targets in @entity8 , so long as they " do it right this time			1
" prime minister @entity11 told @entity0 's @entity12 that @entity2 has " paid a heavy price " for polarization in the region and instability in @entity8 , saying @entity7 fighters have inflicted tremendous pain , suffering and losses on his people after crossing into @entity2			1
he expressed hope the airstrikes will do what @entity3 president @entity23 has vowed : degrade and destroy the group , which calls itself the @entity26			0
it 's good some @entity5 nations have joined the @entity3 - led military campaign , @entity11 added , though he said he wished they had understood and acted on the danger posed by @entity7 sooner			1
" we have warned ... this is going to end in a bloodbath if nobody stops it , " he said			0
" the newly installed prime minister said , " i personally am happy that everybody is seeing this danger , so that they are going to do something about it			2
and i hope they ... do it right , and they do n't do it their own way			0
" elaborating on that latter point , @entity11 said , " i hope we 're not going to see a crush of @entity52 " -- another term for @entity7 that some say sounds like an @entity57 word for " to trample on , " which the militants reportedly despise -- " and the rise of another terrorist element instead of them			1
" @entity3 - @entity5 coalition bolstered by show of force one thing the @entity3 military has not done well enough when it comes to its strikes against @entity7 targets in @entity2 is work in close coordination with @entity2 ground forces , according to @entity11			1
" our forces are moving forward and , when they are moving forward , they need air cover , they need air support , " said the prime minister			2
" that air support is not forthcoming			0
" @entity81 added : " we ask for it , but of course the coalition -- they have their own ... plan			2
" @entity3 - led airstrikes in @entity8 : who 's in , who 's not ' if we do n't work together , we do n't deserve a country ' that comment may beg the question : what is @entity11 's plan for @entity2 ? the @entity96 nation has been in turmoil for years			1
in addition to questions about its effectiveness in providing security and basic needs to its people , the government was panned for being dominated by @entity105 -- like former prime minister @entity106 -- and alienating @entity107			1
( notably , @entity7 is made up of @entity107 pushing to institute their hard - line brand of @entity110 law in any territory they control , while ruthlessly lashing out at those who do n't subscribe to their mission			1
) after @entity23 's withdrawal of @entity3 ground troops , @entity2 's military was maligned , especially after @entity7 fighters speedily overran wide swaths of the country , at times prompting @entity2 troops to drop their weapons and run			2
@entity81 conceded tuesday that the @entity124 extremist group controls at least 25 % of land in his country and is on the doorstep of the capital , @entity129			0
@entity2 soldiers , police flee posts in @entity133 this is n't to say @entity11 deserves blame for this predicament			1
he officially took power on september 8 , a few weeks after being endorsed by @entity106 , his fellow @entity105 and @entity139 member			0
still , even if he has n't been in charge long , this is @entity11 's problem now			2
the new prime minister said he does not want militias any more in @entity2 , saying armed forces " must all be under the umbrella of the state			1
" @entity81 added that he prefers that those in @entity7 - controlled territories " liberate their own areas " with support from the government , rather than have @entity2 troops march in			1
as to bringing the country together , the @entity2 leader said , " we 've worked hard to make ( the government ) more inclusive " and " i think we 've got ( @entity107 ) almost on board right now			1
" @entity81 said a priority for him after he leaves @entity159 -- where he , like other world leaders , are at the @entity161 -- will be nominating defense and interior ministers , one of whom will be @entity107			2
its history of secular and political division , not to mention bloodshed , notwithstanding , @entity11 said @entity2 can survive if @entity105 and @entity107 can work together			1
" i think we can			0
we have to , " he added			0
" ... this is our country			0
and if we do n't work together , we do n't deserve a country			0
" ... we have to work together			0
we have to give in to each other			0
and i 'm prepared to do hard decisions			0
... i expect others to do their own as well			0

new : prime minister @entity11 : @entity107 " almost on board " with @entity105 - led government
new : he says all @entity2 " must work together , " be willing to make tough decisions
@entity81 says his government has been warning about @entity7 " bloodbath " for years
he hopes airstrikes do n't lead to " the rise of another terrorist element instead of " @entity7
