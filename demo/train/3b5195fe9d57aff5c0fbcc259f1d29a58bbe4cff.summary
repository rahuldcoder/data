-- nearly a month has passed since a joint @entity3 - @entity2 drug raid fired upon a riverboat that survivors say was carrying civilians , not traffickers			1
@entity8 were killed , including two pregnant women			2
the mission -- carried out aboard helicopters owned by the @entity12 and with support of @entity15 agents -- laid bare the reach of @entity2 involvement in @entity3 security missions , as well as its associated risks			1
the apparent error stirred some local outrage , but the sentiment did not spread to the capital			2
the @entity3 government , publicly at least , has not reprimanded the @entity2 for any role it may have had , or said anything about reconsidering its cooperation arrangement			1
it contrasts what is seen when civilians are killed in @entity31 , for instance , where tensions between the two nations are inflamed			1
or , closer to home , imagine if @entity37 security forces killed civilians in an operation with any level of @entity2 support , said @entity42 , senior director of policy at the @entity44			1
there would be people in the streets protesting and visible outrage , he said			0
the relatively muted reaction in @entity3 to the may 11 incident in the country 's @entity53 region , reveals much about the @entity57 country 's relationship with the @entity2 and the dire security situation it faces , experts said			1
@entity3 has the highest per capita homicide rate in the world ; it was 82.1 per 100,000 residents in 2011			1
it is also becoming a hotspot for drug trafficking , as @entity37 cartels push their operations south of their own border because of increased enforcement in their country			2
the boat shooting was part of the response to these problems			0
@entity74 , the owner of the boat that was attacked , says she was transporting 13 passengers before dawn on the morning of may 11 on a river near the town of @entity80 , when the helicopters appeared overhead			0
her boat was nearing the landing , and she had never had problems on this route in 26 years , so she did n't think anything when the dark was broken by lights from the choppers			0
in an instant , gunfire erupted and she jumped into the water			0
" i do n't know how to swim , but somehow i made it to shore , " she recalled in a teleconference with reporters this week			0
" i was swimming with @entity98			0
" she held onto a branch in the water for three hours before help arrived , she said			0
the next thing she remembered she was in the hospital			0
the @entity12 this week said a preliminary investigation by @entity3 authorities found that their security forces were justified in firing in self - defense			1
there was anger from the local population after the shooting , but it did not manifest itself at the national or international level			0
the @entity113 detailed how , instead , local residents burned down four houses believed to belong to local drug traffickers			2
" my sense is that @entity3 are finding themselves in a desperate situation and they really want @entity2 cooperation , and that gives the @entity2 some margin to make mistakes , " said @entity117 , president of the @entity118			1
despite how worrying it is that an enforcement operation may have killed innocent civilians , the fact remains that @entity3 is confronting a very violent time , he said			1
that said , even the @entity3 have their limits , and the incident should serve a warning to the @entity2			1
" i think the @entity2 will be well - advised to be very careful			1
this should be an alarm , " @entity117 said			0
serious review and accountability needed " there has to be a much greater sense of accountability			0
" thus far , the @entity2 government has downplayed its role in the shooting			1
the @entity15 was involved , but only in a supporting role , agency spokeswoman @entity142 said			0
@entity12 spokeswoman @entity144 emphasized that the agents did not use force			0
" no @entity2 personnel fired any weapons			2
we were involved purely supporting and advising , " she said			0
still , the type of cooperation between the @entity2 and @entity3 is unprecedented in some ways			1
unlike other @entity2 anti-drug aid , like @entity155 , there does not appear to be the same strict limits on the role of @entity2 agents , @entity42 said			2
@entity3 has " always been a strong security partner of the @entity2 , and a willing one , " he said			1
the soft reaction to the @entity80 shooting boils down to a contradiction of @entity3 ' situation , said @entity166 , professor of politics and international relations at @entity169			1
militarizing the war on drugs raises the possibility of civilians being killed , but at the same time , citizens wants security above all , he said			2
" there is a very , very high possibility that errors will occur , mistakes are going to happen , and we will kill civilians , " he said			2
but , " what average citizens in @entity3 want is to be safe			2
" it 's a contradiction that he sees across the region			0
" people distrust the police , but they want more police , " he said .			0
