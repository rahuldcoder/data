@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 and @entity4 are two of the modern era 's greatest tennis players			1
between them , they have won a staggering 27 @entity9 singles titles -- and yet , neither player has ever won the @entity12			0
tennis great @entity3 won 14 @entity9 tournaments but never managed a @entity12 victory			1
that legendary players like @entity3 and @entity4 have somehow failed to win at @entity16 is just one of the reasons why this @entity9 tournament holds such a special place on the tennis calendar			1
the @entity12 is notably the only @entity9 event contested on clay -- a factor that separates it from the other three majors , and more than anything else defines the tournament			1
the layers of crushed brick that constitute the orange - red clay courts of @entity16 are what brought @entity3 -- and still bring @entity4 -- so much grief			1
fellow greats @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 also failed to win the coveted title			2
the reason clay may have affected the natural games of these players is because the surface slows the ball and produces a slightly higher , loopier bounce than grass or hard courts			2
this means the high - power serve of someone like @entity3 is negated , opening the way for players with a different style of game			2
to this extent , the @entity12 helped create the legend of one of the finest players of all time -- @entity59 star @entity58			1
@entity58 won a record six times at @entity16			2
he also won five @entity62 titles -- but never managed an @entity65 or @entity64 crown , both tournaments fought out on hard courts			0
describing what makes the @entity12 so special in an rare one - on - one interview with @entity72 web site @entity70 in 2001 , @entity58 said : " it is toughest to win on clay			1
it is easily the most draining , the toughest slam			0
" offering advice to @entity3 , who was at the time still playing for a @entity12 title , @entity58 added , " i would advise him to concentrate on mental strength , to build it up , to hold that strength over the course of the fortnight			1
" along with that , you also need a great deal of physical strength			0
and most importantly , you have to believe that you can win on clay			0
" it is not surprising therefore , that @entity93 players -- who are generally well - accustomed to playing on clay -- have come to dominate the tournament in recent years			0
nine of the last 12 @entity12 finals have featured at least one @entity98			0
the tournament is still held in high regard by @entity101 's population			0
a record crowd of more than 450,000 people came to watch the action at @entity16 in 2008 , and according to the tournament organizers , it is the most - watched @entity12 event in the world			1
first played in 1891 as a national tournament , it became an international event in 1925 , and in 1928 moved to the @entity16 facility at @entity112 in @entity113 , where it remains today			0
its chosen title , @entity16 , was the name of a legendary @entity118 @entity12 aviator , who had frequented the tennis venue when he studied in @entity113			1
the 2009 edition of what @entity58 called " the toughest slam " promises to be just as entertaining and draining as those that have gone before			2
@entity126 number one @entity125 is searching for his fifth consecutive title to usurp @entity58 's record of four in a row , which he currently equals			0
meanwhile , world number two @entity4 is looking to avenge three consecutive final defeats at the hands of @entity125			0
in the women 's draw , the tournament appears wide open			0
last year 's champion @entity136 has slipped to eighth in the world rankings , while the top four ranked players have only one @entity12 title between them .			1

legendary players like @entity3 and @entity4 have failed to win @entity12 title
@entity16 is the only grand slam tennis event held on clay courts
