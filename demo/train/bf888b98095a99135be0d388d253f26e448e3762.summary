-- president @entity2 's @entity1 address predictably focused on his domestic priorities			1
immigration reform , a laundry list of economic initiatives including infrastructure improvements ( fix it first ) , clean energy , some manufacturing innovation , a bit of educational reform and the rhetorical high point of his speech -- gun control			2
as in years past , foreign policy made up only about 15 % of the speech , but even within that usual limited attention , tuesday night 's address pointed to few new directions			1
on @entity22 -- @entity24 's longest war -- @entity2 expressed just a continued commitment to bringing the troops home , ending " our war " while theirs continues			1
on @entity30 , there was a single sentence reiterating the need for a diplomatic solution , which makes me think that a big diplomatic push is not likely			2
on @entity37 , boilerplate promises to isolate the country further after its provocative nuclear test , and on @entity40 , a call to " keep the pressure " on the regime , which means more watching from the sidelines as the horror unfolds			2
notably , @entity46 was mentioned only twice -- once in the context of jobs , and another time with respect to clean energy			1
nothing about managing what could very well be this administration 's most vexing but critically important bilateral relationship			0
@entity2 's call for a reinvigorated free trade agenda was his boldest foreign policy statement of the evening			1
he is right to note that free trade " supports millions of good - paying @entity24 jobs , " but his pledge to pursue a " comprehensive @entity61 " -- a free trade agreement with @entity63 -- will run into significant opposition from organized labor , especially given ongoing weaknesses in the economy			1
without fast track negotiating authority , the prospects for such a deal are minimal			0
fast track authority , which allows the president to negotiate trade deals that @entity75 can then only approve or disapprove but not amend , expired in 2007 , and it would require quite a breakthrough for @entity75 to approve it again			0
still , despite these challenges , an agreement is worth pursuing			0
aside from a free trade agreement with @entity63 , there was little else in this @entity1 that hinted at foreign policy ambition			1
but unpredictable events have a way of derailing @entity24 's best laid plans to stay above the fray of the world 's messiest problems			0
who could have predicted just a few months ago that @entity89 would get a mention in the @entity1 ? @entity91 -- not uttered once tonight -- could re-emerge as a formidable crisis ; @entity30 , @entity93 and @entity37 also have tremendous potential to erupt			0
while this administration seems determined to focus inward on getting @entity24 's economic and fiscal house in order , i doubt events in the rest of the world will be so accommodating			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity104			0

@entity104 : @entity2 mainly addressed domestic issues : economy , immigration , energy
he spoke very little about and *offered* nothing much new on foreign policy , she says
@entity116 : he talked about ending @entity117 , spoke *briefly* about @entity30 , @entity40 , @entity46
@entity116 : his reinvigorated free trade agenda seems to be the boldest move
