even before hitting newsstands , @entity1 's essay in @entity2 provoked its share of reactions across social media , from shrugs to bemusement to outright hostility			1
the reactions are easy to understand when you 're talking about a former @entity11 intern whose affair with @entity13 threatened to bring down his presidency			2
now that her essay is out , it reveals a woman still haunted by the events of nearly two decades ago			2
it also offers insights into someone who has moved on			2
here are the six major takeaways : 1			2
@entity1 devotes considerable ink to her various forays into the job market			1
we all know about the handbags she peddled in the late 1990s and her stint as a @entity34 spokeswoman			0
in her essay , she spells out awkward conversations in offices from @entity39 , @entity40 , to @entity41 , hearing rejection upon rejection due to " what my potential employers so tactfully referred to as my ' history			2
' " @entity1 recalls an interview in 2008 , in which fear of entanglements with the @entity50 torpedoed her chances			1
" there is a 25 percent chance that mrs. @entity54 will be the next president , " she recounts being told			1
" we would first need a letter of indemnification from the @entity50			0
" " i gave a fake smile , " she writes , a skill she apparently cultivated over 16 years of infamy , " and said ' i understand			0
' " @entity1 clearly holds her notoriety responsible for these difficulties -- from finding meaningful work to emotional and romantic struggles			1
" i look back now , shake my head in disbelief , and wonder : what was i -- what were we -- thinking ? i would give anything to go back and rewind the tape			0
she 's dreading a @entity73 run			2
" despite what some headlines will falsely report about this piece , this is not about me versus the @entity50 , " @entity1 writes			1
then why speak out now ? because this ai n't her first rodeo			0
" in 2008 , when @entity54 was running for president , i remained virtually reclusive , " she writes			1
" when i hear of @entity54 's prospective candidacy , i can not help but fear the next wave of paparazzi , the next wave of ' where is she now ? ' stories , the next reference to me in @entity90 ' coverage of the primaries , " @entity1 says in her essay			1
but despite her doubts , she decided to go on the record because she did n't want to wait " another 8 to 10 years " and because " i turned 40 last year " and because " i 'm determined to have a different ending to my story			0
at times , she had " suicidal temptations			0
" another motivation for @entity1 to write the piece : a young man named @entity101			1
the 18 - year - old 's suicide in 2008 brought back memories for @entity1 and her mother of some of the darkest times following the scandal , she writes			1
the @entity109 freshman took his own life after his roommate streamed a video , surreptitiously recorded , of him kissing another man			0
@entity115 's death struck a chord with @entity1 's mother " it was an unbearably tragic event , " @entity1 writes , but " i could n't quite grasp why my mom was so distraught			1
" after the news of the affair broke , her mom " stayed by my bed , night after night , because i , too , was suicidal			0
the shame , the scorn and the fear that had been thrown at her daughter left her afraid that i would take my own life -- a fear that i would literally be humiliated to death			0
" @entity1 adds that she never attempted suicide but that she had " strong suicidal temptations several times during the investigation and one or two periods after			1
she was a " foolish " 24 - year - old			0
throughout the essay , @entity1 acknowledges her own complicity in her misery , but also steps back to mull over the spectacle of the affair , which she says was consensual			1
" at the time -- at least from my point of view -- it was an authentic connection , with emotional intimacy , frequent visits , plans made , phone calls and gifts exchanged , " she writes			0
" in my early 20s , i was too young to understand the real life consequences			0
" looking back , @entity1 muses on how difficult it was for her to move on			1
" unlike the other parties involved , i was so young that i had no established identity to which i could return			0
" " if you have n't figured out how you are , it 's hard not to accept the horrible image of you created by others , " she observes			2
and also one of frustration " i remained ' stuck ' for far too many years			0
i date ! " 6			0
she 's penned a compelling essay			2
many may only read the headlines but that 's a mistake			2
the whole piece is worth consideration			0
@entity1 's story is , for better or for worse , part of @entity169 's political history			1
opinion : stop judging @entity1 @entity50 ' relationship with media still testy after all these years in political extramarital affairs , the mistress rarely emerges unscathed			1

@entity1 has many regrets
she 's bracing for @entity54 2016
she had thoughts of suicide
her " history " has cost her jobs
