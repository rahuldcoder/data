@entity0 , @entity1 -- attorneys for @entity4 , a former @entity5 - area police officer accused of murdering his third wife , argued during opening statements tuesday that their client spent his career protecting the public and that murder accusations are groundless			1
" @entity12 slipped , fell , hit her head in a household accident , and drowned			0
case closed , " said attorney @entity15			0
@entity17 was found dead in a bathtub in 2004			1
@entity4 also remains under investigation in the october 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity21			0
prosecutors , meanwhile , argued that @entity4 was motivated to kill , at least in part , by his desire to avoid settlement payments to his ex-wife			0
" this ( is ) not a case where you 'll have dna , fingerprints , or a videotaped confession			0
( but ) when you 've heard all the evidence , you 'll be able to determine that @entity4 killed @entity17 beyond a reasonable doubt , " said @entity28 state 's attorney @entity27 during his opening statement			1
prosecutors called @entity38 , a neighbor , as their first witness			1
her voice cracked on a couple of occasions as she described finding the body of @entity44 , her friend			0
@entity45 is scheduled to resume wednesday morning			1
a jury of seven men and five women , chosen over two days last week , will decide @entity4 's fate during the trial in @entity0 , @entity1 , which is expected to last about a month , according to his lawyer			1
@entity4 , 58 , was married to @entity44 in 2001 when he had an affair with then - 17 - year - old @entity53 , who later became @entity21			0
@entity44 and @entity4 filed for divorce that october , and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years			0
@entity57 , @entity1 , police records indicate officers were called to @entity44 's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004			1
@entity4 had @entity44 arrested twice for domestic violence , though she was found not guilty in both cases			2
a judge in march 2002 granted @entity44 a protection order from her ex-husband , prohibiting him from being near her , entering her home or taking out their children except for two brief weekly visits			0
@entity44 had claimed that months later , @entity4 held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her inside her home			0
on february 27 , 2004 , @entity4 picked up his two sons from @entity44 's home , spending the next two days with them			2
prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on february 29 and killed @entity44 ; she was found naked and dead in her dry tub the next day			2
at the time of her death , a court was mulling how their marital assets would be divided , and @entity44 was set to receive part of @entity4 's pension and other support			2
police initially treated the scene as an accident , although the @entity88 was later brought in to investigate			0
@entity4 's trial had been set to start in july 2010 but was delayed			1
in april , an @entity1 appellate court ruled that prosecutors may use potentially incriminating statements made by @entity44 and @entity4 's still - missing wife @entity21 against him , a key development in the case			1
the ruling overturned an earlier judge 's decision that forbade prosecutors from using eight statements made by @entity44 before her death and by @entity21 before her disappearance			1
the defense had argued that using the statements would violate @entity4 's right to confront the witnesses against him .			2
