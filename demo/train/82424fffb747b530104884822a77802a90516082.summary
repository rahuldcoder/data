" @entity0 " fans have suggested new movie titles -- " @entity3 : attack of the mouse " -- and last minute @entity7 costumes -- @entity8 for him and @entity11 princess @entity10 for her -- since learning of the @entity11 's $ 4 billion acquisition of @entity14 on tuesday			1
but beyond the clever " @entity0 " - @entity11 mashups , there appears to be a great deal of ambiguity surrounding the big merger and the announcement of " @entity3			1
" targeted for release in 2015 , " @entity3 " will kickoff a planned trilogy of live - action " @entity0 " films , to be released " every two to three years , " @entity11 said in a press release			1
despite reports -- and the hopes of some passionate fans -- that @entity30 will simply serve as a consultant mapping out basic plotlines , we 're not yet sure how involved the " @entity0 " creator and @entity14 founder will actually be in future installments			1
though some fans are convinced that @entity30 ' involvement , or lack thereof , will affect " @entity3 's " ability to return " @entity42 " to its pre- " @entity41 " glory days			1
social media goes wild over @entity11 + @entity0 since the prequel trilogy turned some fans off , " @entity0 " has introduced " @entity0 : the @entity51 , " the successful animated series that airs on @entity48 ; video games ; comic books and toys			1
" there 's still a lot of rumbling discontent with the last three ' @entity0 ' films and the way the franchise ( has gone ) over the last five / six years in particular , " said @entity54 editor @entity52			2
" it 's been pillaged to an extent			0
" however , he added , " if you have an interest in ' @entity0 ' on the big screen , than this is about as good a piece of news that 's come through in the last 30 years			0
" @entity70 's @entity69 is n't sold			0
" i do n't think i 'm alone in dreading the idea of paying another goddamn red cent for a ' @entity0 ' movie ticket after @entity30 made three terrible movies and went back to monkeyfart with the older , better ones , ruining them in the process , " @entity69 wrote			1
" now the series is finally free from @entity30 ' ambling , simplistic vision			1
" there is a lot of criticism directed at @entity30			1
some of it is deserved and some of it is n't , @entity84 said , adding that there 's a sense that , by focusing on the business side more than the creative side , @entity30 has " been cheapening what he created			1
" regardless , he says , the filmmaker 's genius is palpable			0
that said , " taking ( the impending films ) away from his control and cutting them fresh would be the more positive way forward			2
... it got to the point where ( @entity30 ) held ' @entity0 ' back			2
... there are so many new , interesting voices in science fiction , " @entity84 said			0
he pointed to franchises like " @entity107 " and " @entity108 , " which he believes have flourished thanks to new voices			0
whether @entity11 is able to do with @entity14 what they 've done with @entity115 and @entity116 , which earned more than $ 1 billion at the box office with this year 's " @entity118 , " remains to be seen			1
but many fans agree that new screenwriters and a new director alone could aid the " @entity0 " universe			2
a dedicated fan and webmaster at @entity126 and @entity127 , @entity123 said he " could n't be happier " about the news and @entity30 ' muted new role			2
" the fans that care about the story a lot and the movies a lot are happy that ( @entity30 will ) be creatively involved , and even more happy that he wont ' be actively involved in the directing and maybe even the writing , " he said			1
the potential for something great outweighs the potential for a train wreck at this point , @entity84 said			0
he noted @entity144 's success with @entity146 ' " @entity145 " in 2009			0
( the sequel , " @entity147 , " is due out in may 2013			0
) the worst case scenario of bringing a new " @entity0 " trilogy to life , he added , is that we " could end up pretty much where we already are , or halfway between the old films and the new films			0
" @entity70 's @entity69 compared his love for the franchise to " rooting for a sports team that never wins anything ( or more accurately , a sports team that won three titles 30 years ago and has n't won a game since )			0
" @entity11 knows how crucial " @entity3 " is , @entity84 said , specially with the promise of an additional two films in the bank			2
" the potential at this point , " he said , " is as pure as it 's been for awhile			0

on tuesday , the @entity11 announced its $ 4 billion acquisition of @entity14
reports state that @entity30 will simply serve as a consultant and map out basic plotlines
some fans say that taking control away from @entity30 will save the franchise
