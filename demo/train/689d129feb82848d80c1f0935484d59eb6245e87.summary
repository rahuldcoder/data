@entity0 -- @entity2 launched a satellite friday , starting a three - year mission to help better understand climate change			1
@entity2 sent the @entity7 satellite into orbit from @entity9 in @entity10			2
for the next three years , the @entity7 satellite will look back at @entity12 and generate monthly maps of sea salt movements , data that are crucial to the understanding of global climate change and ocean currents			1
the project will give scientists the information they need to better predict @entity23 and @entity24 tropical climate patterns in the @entity25			1
until now , such research has been limited to ship and buoy instrumentation			0
the long - term project , which began in 2001 , is the culmination of a joint effort between @entity2 and @entity32 's @entity31			1
program executive @entity33 said the launch " represents a great leap forward for the two agencies and ( their ) collaborations			0
" the @entity39 rocket carried an @entity32 - built satellite with @entity42 data - gathering instruments			1
the mission will also serve as an environmental data - gathering project for @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			2
it was delayed once this week because of a guidance computer problem			0
the $ 287 million satellite will provide insights into water circulation and changes around the globe by measuring the microwave energy emitted from the ocean during weekly scans			0
the mission begins to fulfill part of president @entity62 's 2010 pledge to focus @entity2 more on " science that will garner tangible benefits , helping us to protect our environment for future generations			0
" @entity68 is the 14th @entity69 satellite in space			2
@entity1 's @entity71 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity75 satellite launched friday
it will generate maps of sea salt movements to aid the understanding of climate change
project is a joint effort with the @entity32 space agency
