-- world no. 1 @entity1 is facing a race against time to be fit for the @entity4 after succumbing to the frenetic schedule of women 's tennis			1
the @entity8 was forced to withdraw from the @entity9 with an injury to her left knee midway through the first set of her opening match against @entity16 on thursday			0
with just 17 days until the start of the competition at @entity19 , the @entity22 champion 's hopes of adding to her sole grand slam triumph look slim			1
the 23 - year - old reached the semifinals of @entity26 last month , before going on to compete at the @entity27 where she won bronze in the singles and gold in the mixed doubles on sunday			2
the workload has taken its toll on @entity1 , who will now also miss next week 's @entity36 event			1
" the last week took so much energy out of me that i had absolutely no time to recover , and my body is feeling it , " she told reporters			1
" it was a little bit too quick of a transition for me to come and start the training , and i felt my knee just was n't in good shape			0
" it 's unfortunate because i was really looking forward to playing here			2
i have really enjoyed being here			0
i tried yesterday and today it just got worse			0
i ca n't see the point of continuing to play if i ca n't give even 50 % of my game			0
" @entity1 , who has never made it past the fourth round at the @entity4 , said she needs rest and recuperation if she is to line up in @entity56 later this month			1
" i hope it 's a short - term thing			1
i have to just stop and take a little bit of time off because i had absolutely no rest for a long period of time			2
i just need to settle it down and go from there			0
hopefully there 's nothing serious about it , " she said			2
" if i can not play here , there is no chance for me to play anywhere else			0
my first goal is to get healthy and make sure i 'm 100 % ready to play the @entity4			0
" the hectic schedule claimed another victim when world no. 2 @entity72 also pulled out of the @entity75 event in @entity76			1
the @entity78 champion , who was defeated in the @entity80 final by @entity81 , missed @entity82 due to a stomach virus			1
the @entity84 hopes to recover in time for the @entity4 , which she won in 2006 .			0
