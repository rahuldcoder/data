@entity0 , @entity1 -- stand anywhere in the @entity1 town of @entity0 and look up			1
if your eyes do n't fix on a magnificent @entity8 mountain peak , then you will surely be looking at one of the @entity11 ruins in the immediate area			1
@entity0 offers spectacular views of a charming village , ancient ruins and magnificent mountains			1
no need to worry about a crick in your neck ; the view at eye level is just as pretty			0
there are no neon signs , no hotels or restaurants with names that you will recognize , just charming local businesses set on cobblestone streets			0
narrow chutes frame the streets and carry water from the mountaintops through town , toward the railroad tracks , and into the @entity36			2
the locals are easily recognized in their brightly colored hand - woven clothing -- bright blue , orange and red shirts and skirts -- as they go about their daily business , whether tending the nearby fields or guiding a mule carrying firewood			1
when planning a trip to the area 's star attraction -- the mountaintop @entity11 ruins of @entity50 -- this gem of a town in @entity1 's @entity53 is not to be missed			1
the @entity53 is the area between @entity54 -- the historic capital of the @entity56 and the tourism gateway -- and @entity50 , which was recently voted one of the new seven wonders of the world			0
typically , visitors who plan to stay overnight in the @entity53 are trying to adjust to the altitude before heading to the higher and larger city of @entity54			0
acclimating to elevations of more than 11,000 feet above sea level is a good reason to head directly down to the valley after arriving at the @entity69 , but the tiny town called @entity0 is another great reason to set aside at least a couple of your vacation days			2
@entity0 is one of those rare places where you 'd rather look at the beauty through the naked eye than through the lens of a camera			2
the camera just does n't seem to capture the " wow " factor			0
during the dry season from april to october , the sky between the surrounding peaks is often a piercing azure blue			0
but visitors ca n't be expected to stand on a street corner taking in the view all day , and thankfully , there is plenty to do in this old @entity11 village			2
the main attraction , the @entity95 , a former @entity11 fortress , attracts busloads of day trippers that unload by the market			1
from down the street , you can see the tourists climbing the many terraces that , during @entity11 times , were used for agriculture and decorative purposes			1
the highest point on the hill is where you will find the unfinished @entity111 of the sun. on tours , visitors learn that these ruins were built in the shape of a llama , and guides will point out the face of the @entity11 sun god carved on the side of the neighboring mountain			1
you need to purchase a ticket to visit this site			0
across town are other @entity11 sites , also visible from the town 's cobblestone corners , where you can hike up to the ruins free of charge			1
there are many nice walks around the town , and the local museum has a display on the wall that lists the time they should take and the area to cover			0
if you want a break from the ruins , try white - water rafting , mountain climbing or horseback riding			1
and if you ca n't get enough of the natural beauty , opt for a bicycle trip down the @entity148			0
bicycle trip organizers will drive you up and drop you off on an asphalt road at about 14,000 feet above sea level , and you ride -- or really glide -- down on bicycles			0
make sure your body has acclimated to the altitude of @entity0 , which is about 9,186 feet , before you embark on this tour			2
the ride offers great views of the snow - capped @entity158 , and you 'll see livestock grazing and patches of land being tended by farmers			2
the entire trip takes from three to four hours and costs about $ 40 per person			0
once you have worked up an appetite , you can easily find a good meal in @entity0			2
a hearty local dish , lomo saltado , is served in most restaurants			0
this @entity1 dish is a stir fry that includes steak tidbits , white rice , french fries , onions and tomatoes in a brown gravy			1
if lomo saltado is n't adventurous enough for you , try alpaca or cuy ( guinea pig )			0
you can wash your meal down with a @entity185 sour , the national drink in @entity1 , made with @entity185 brandy , sugar , lemon juice and an egg white			1
there are enough restaurants to choose from , and in some establishments , the food is as good as the fancy places you will find in @entity54			0
there are several trains a day between @entity0 and @entity50 , so it 's feasible to do a day trip to visit the main attraction			2
it 's about a two - hour drive to get to @entity0 from the airport or @entity54 's city center , and it costs no more than $ 30 @entity205 by taxi			1
buses are available and cost a lot less			0
whether you take the bus , train or taxi , consider a stop in this impressive @entity11 town as you check the nearby world wonder off your list .			1
