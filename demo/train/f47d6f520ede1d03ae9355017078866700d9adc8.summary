@entity0 -- the @entity3 budget plan , which passed a key @entity5 vote tuesday , punches way above its weight			2
the relatively skinny , 77 - page bill would affect millions of @entity9 , as well as programs , fees , companies and , oh , the entire economy for years to come			2
here 's our scorecard : winners the @entity17 : there are smiles among the camouflage			1
thanks to @entity3 , the budget - cutting hatchet has been downsized to a knife			2
the deal reverses billions in budget cuts so that the military 's discretionary budget will actually go up $ 2 billion next year ( over the budget - cut amount this year )			1
also , after years of juggling unpredictable , temporary spending bills , the two - year budget deal allows generals and admirals to do something that is military 101 : plan ahead			2
budget deal passes key @entity5 vote federal employees : two biggies -- the deal slashes the chances of a shutdown in january or any furloughs in 2014			1
and there 's a bonus : a technical change in the bill allows federal workers who are married without kids to obtain health benefits under a new , cheaper " self plus one " category			1
they currently have no option but " single " or " family " plans			2
the needy : @entity57 , @entity58 , just about any federally funded program that directly serves the needy could benefit from @entity3			2
how exactly the numbers will land is still unknown , but because the budget deal replaces budget cuts for nonmilitary programs , nonprofits are hopeful			2
" this is good for us , " @entity66 from the @entity67 told @entity1			2
another benefit : as with the military , these programs will know their funding levels for two years and can do critical planning			1
@entity74 : the @entity74 wins from increased security fees -- the budget gives the agency more reliable funding			1
appropriators : imagine @entity80 in his prime , with boxing gloves on but forced to sit outside the ring			0
that 's how the members of @entity87 ' appropriations committees have felt for years			0
once considered to be some of the most powerful people in the capital , the lack of any long - term spending agreement has nearly cut them out of the process			1
the @entity3 - @entity3 plan means appropriators are back on the canvas and will decide how to carve up more than $ 1 trillion , agency by agency			0
@entity99 : @entity100 's rough year @entity9 's reputation : for three years , the world has watched the @entity9 government limp from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis			0
the budget deal sends a message that even a deeply divided @entity87 may be able to do its job and govern			0
santa : no fiscal cliff			0
@entity111 and his sleigh can lift off without any cable channels showing partisan bickering from the @entity116 or @entity5 floor this year			0
losers @entity118 , career military : this compromise deal will mean less retirement pay for military retirees younger than 62			1
specifically , it cuts the annual cost - of - living adjustments to a level under inflation			0
@entity127 : 5 things the budget deal wo n't do new federal workers : you 've got a government job ! congratulations ! but if you start that job after january 1 , this budget bill would cut your pay by 1.3 %			1
that would be an increased , mandatory contribution to the federal pension fund			1
unemployed : the clock is ticking , but the budget agreement does nothing to address unemployment benefits , which expire this month for about 1.3 million @entity9			1
air travelers : you will pay more to be safe			1
this plan boosts the @entity74 security fee to $ 5.60 for each one - way trip			1
technically , airlines pay the fee , but you know how that works			1
a few companies have already admitted that the increase will probably be passed on to consumers			0
rep. @entity155 slams @entity156 , @entity157 ; calls for moderate @entity159 voice scammers and con artists : the budget deal makes it harder for anyone to access and use the @entity166 numbers of dead people			0
and prisoners ? think twice about trying to get an unemployment check			0
that 's illegal , and this deal will make it harder for you to pull off that scam			0
gas and oil industry : two hits : the petroleum industry is set to lose a $ 50 million research program and a kind of backdoor moneymaker in which oil companies purposely overpay into a federal fund and gain higher - than - market interest payments from the government as a result			1
wealthy federal contractors : this may be hard to believe , but right now , federal law will pay up to $ 952,308 in salary for any single contract employee			1
the @entity3 budget deal would cut that down to $ 487,000			1
the years 2016 - 2023 : while this budget deal significantly blunts forced budget cuts ( the " sequester " ) set for the next two years , it would leave those cuts at full power for the following seven years			0
in addition , this bill adds a new set of forced budget cuts and a few extended fees ( customs fees , for example ) for 2022 and 2023			0
the long - term future of the @entity9 : @entity206			0
these fiscal monsters may be silent now , but are set to rise over the next two decades to become huge financial threats to both the federal budget and the @entity9 economy			1
this bill does not address the coming long - term problems			0
@entity127 : republicans to weigh debt ceiling demands countdown clock producers : no shutdown would mean no countdown clock in january			2
though , those who love them could look just a few weeks down the road in 2014 when the debt ceiling presents another fiscal deadline			0
poll : @entity87 neck - and - neck with car salespeople			0

the @entity17 will have more *certainty* in planning how much money it will have to work with
federal employees wo n't have to worry about a shutdown for at least two months
but new federal workers will start their jobs with a 1.3 % pay cut
air travelers will pay airlines more for their security
