-- with the launch of the gleaming new @entity4 , @entity2 billionaire @entity1 can no longer lay claim to being the owner of the world 's largest superyacht			1
at 590 - feet long , the @entity4 is 57 - feet longer than @entity1 's mighty @entity9 -- previously the largest yacht on the waves			1
the hulking superyacht is significantly longer than a football field , larger than the @entity15 's @entity14 and more capacious than many popular cruise ships			2
last month , the behemoth eased cautiously out of its shipyard in @entity19 , @entity20 , ushered by a team of powerful tugboats which were dwarfed by its enormous scale			0
the yacht has been kept under wraps throughout its construction for the past three years			0
the identity of the huge boat 's owner remains a mystery , but some speculate that it belongs to a powerful @entity35 billionaire			2
just building the yacht cost a staggering $ 605 million -- a fee which does n't even begin to take into account the sky - high costs of its annual upkeep			2
in his book on the @entity45 , author @entity43 said that , " operating and maintaining a yacht is at least 10 % of what the thing cost			0
" by which estimation , just keeping the @entity4 on the water could cost as much as $ 60 million every year			2
the project was brought to fruition by @entity53 , who assembled a triumvirate of yacht - building super stars : the @entity4 's engineering was done by premier @entity20 shipbuilding company @entity58 , the exterior design was by @entity59 and the interior was composed by @entity61			1
at present , very little is known about the interior detailing of the vessel			0
a spokesperson for @entity58 said " the yacht is still under construction , and i doubt that we will get permission to shoot her even when she is ready			0
" experts suggest that the interior could match or even surpass the opulence of @entity1 's yacht which is equipped with two helipads , two swimming pools , a cinema , a disco and a mini-submarine that can dive to 150 - feet to explore the ocean floor			1
bullet - proof glass and armor plating lines @entity1 's master bedroom , and the boat has its own missile defence system			1
the @entity4 is described as having a " sophisticated and luxurious interior in a turn of the century @entity89 style			2
" although his primary work is not in yachting , @entity90 interior decorator @entity61 says he is " confident that the final yacht is everything and more the owner expects			0
" @entity97 's @entity96 commented : " for a yacht of this size , i think that she looks amazingly elegant and sleek			0
" as well as its prodigious length , the yacht also travels at a record - breaking pace			0
with a top speed of over 30 knots ( around 34 mph ) , the @entity4 is considered to be the fastest superyacht on the sea			1
the @entity4 is the latest in a line of vessels to have held the mantle of world 's largest yacht			1
prior to the @entity9 , the 482 - foot @entity112 , owned by the @entity114 royal family , held the record for 22 years			1
and before it , the @entity116 was briefly the record - holder			0
built by @entity120 businessman @entity119 , @entity118 came in at 454 - feet and cost $ 200 million			1
with many more billionaires around the world eager to inscribe their names into the history books , it is anyone 's guess quite how long the @entity4 will remain at the top			1
for now , its mystery owner can revel in the knowledge that his or her boat is at the very pinnacle of the yachting pecking order .			0

590 - foot @entity4 becomes world 's largest superyacht
the yacht is 57 - feet longer than @entity2 billionaire @entity1 's @entity9
with a top speed of 30 - knots , the @entity4 is also the fastest superyacht on the waves
