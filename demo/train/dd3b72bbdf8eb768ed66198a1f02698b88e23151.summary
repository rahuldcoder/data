@entity0 is founder and president of @entity2 , a strategy and management consulting firm that specializes in energy and the environment and is a subsidiary of @entity7			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , consultants at @entity2 , also contributed to this article			0
@entity0 says society should aim to transform all jobs into " green jobs			1
" @entity15 ( @entity16 ) -- in a recent @entity16 commentary entitled " @entity19 jobs : hope or hype ? " @entity22 argues that green job creation will be insufficient to bring @entity24 out of recession			1
but @entity22 narrowly defines green as a " sector , " and fails to see its potential as a strategy for the revitalization of the entire economy			2
when the public debate is focused around the precise number of green jobs created in , say , a solar panel factory , we miss the opportunity as a country to think more broadly about greening the economy -- and building a foundation for real growth and competitiveness			1
the aspiration to create " green jobs " should really be seen as shorthand for two public priorities -- immediate job creation and long - term transformation of the economy for sustainability and prosperity -- and both goals can be addressed simultaneously			1
however , in judging our progress , a simple tally of jobs in " green sectors " is only a partial indicator of the impact and thus can be misleading			0
a lot depends here on definitions			0
for example , @entity22 cites a 2008 report produced by @entity64 on behalf of the @entity65 , which identifies a little more than 750,000 green jobs in the @entity24 today			1
a report in the same year , from the @entity68 , counts more than 9 million green jobs in the @entity24			1
this is not to say that one report is better than the other , but to point out that much difference -- in this case , more than 8 million jobs -- depends on how you count			0
the critical point @entity22 misses is that it 's not just job creation in new green industries that matter , but also new jobs in traditional industries -- or the retooling of old jobs -- to make those industries greener			1
a great example is the real estate industry			0
energy efficiency retrofits of buildings and homes have the potential to yield significant savings in energy costs while creating work for building engineers , electricians , contractors , manufacturers and people in a whole host of other industries that would not typically be considered " green			2
" by comparison , 10 or 15 years ago anyone who used a computer was considered to have a " tech job , " but now nearly everyone uses a computer ( and a cell phone and a pda ) and yet we do n't call all jobs " tech jobs			0
" we talk about how technology has changed every industry and profession			0
moreover , even investments in sectors we recognize as green can have other positive economic impacts			0
investing in wind power , for example , creates jobs in wind turbine manufacturing plants as well as jobs in the industries that supply the plant with parts , jobs producing the materials that make up these parts , jobs producing the electricity used in the plant , and so on			0
there is solid evidence that investment in green economic activity will result in more jobs than many other comparable investments because a greater proportion of funds would go toward labor and would remain in the @entity24			1
the @entity142 and the @entity143 examined the impact of comparable investments in the oil and gas industry , tax refunds to stimulate household spending , and six specific energy efficiency and renewable energy strategies			2
they concluded that $ 100 billion of investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency would create approximately 2 million jobs , compared to 1.7 million jobs from stimulating household spending and about half a million jobs from investment in oil and gas			1
by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency as strategies for our economy , we will create jobs in the @entity24 , not just green jobs			1
more importantly , we lay the groundwork for @entity24 economic competitiveness and moral leadership in a carbon - constrained world			0
if we fail to support environmental innovation through investment and public policy , the @entity24 will find itself at a disadvantage relative to other nations			0
@entity24 is at a crossroads			0
if we see green as an engine of growth , there is an unprecedented opportunity to create jobs and revitalize the economy through smart , wide - ranging investments supported by changes in public policy			2
in the debate over green job creation , we must not lose sight of the larger objective -- the creation of an economy that is more sustainable , in terms of employment , competitiveness and impact on the natural world			2
what we need to be asking is : how can we make every industry a green industry and every job a green job ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			2

@entity0 : *skeptics* argue that only a small number of jobs are green
he says green industries and jobs can be the *key* to revitalizing economy
@entity0 : as economy goes green , jobs will be transformed
he says @entity24 will lose competitive edge if it does n't invest in renewable energy
