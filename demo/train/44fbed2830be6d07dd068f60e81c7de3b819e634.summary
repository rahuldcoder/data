@entity0 lives with her mother , sister and her sister 's two children in the concrete jungle of @entity7 refugee camp near @entity8 in the @entity9			1
yet @entity10 is growing enough vegetables on her roof to feed her family and pass the surplus on to her neighbors			2
@entity10 's family is one of 15 in @entity7 to have a greenhouse on their roof as part of a project which is now being extended to other @entity23 refugee camps			1
money is tight with no wage - earners in the household , so @entity10 is grateful for the money she saves on vegetables			1
" it saves a lot of money and it 's great to practice being a farmer , " said @entity10			2
" it makes me happy working inside our greenhouse			0
" we grow tomatoes , cucumbers , green beans , aubergines and zucchini			2
my neighbors often come round asking if we have any to spare , which makes me very popular			0
" and it tastes so much better because there are no chemicals			0
" the rooftop greenhouse project was launched in april by @entity48 , an ngo based in @entity49 that works with women and children			2
@entity7 , established in 1949 on 0.3 square kilometers , is home to 13,000 people , a third of whom are unemployed , according to the @entity57 @entity56 for @entity23 refugees			1
@entity59 , the greenhouse project manager , said : " we have no green spaces and a bad economic situation			0
most people are from families with a farming background who no longer have contact with the land			1
" the idea of the project is to help people in their economic life and at the same time renew their contact with the land			2
" he said the first season had been a success , with most families growing enough vegetables to feed themselves with some leftover for neighbors			1
@entity59 said goods imported to the @entity9 go through @entity83 and are sold at @entity83 prices , which means fruit and vegetables are expensive for most palestinians , who have much lower incomes			1
he estimated that many save a quarter of their overall monthly budget by growing their own fruit and vegetables			1
the first greenhouses were paid for through a donation made by a @entity23 @entity95 woman			1
a further set paid for by the @entity57 have been erected in nearby @entity98 refugee camp			2
now @entity99 is talking to larger ngos about expanding the project further afield			0
" we are going to have 65 greenhouses soon ... we would like to keep giving them to as many families as we can , " said @entity59			1
at least 18 % of @entity9 residents live below the poverty line , according to the @entity108			0
he said the scheme was administered by women , to help them achieve a better status in their families and communities			1
families were chosen to take part according to their need , having enough sun on their roofs and being willing and keen on agriculture , said @entity59			0
" we are thinking about making a collective association so people can sell the vegetables they have leftover at a cheap price to benefit other people as well , " he added			0
@entity59 said some people were initially skeptical about the greenhouses because some had previously tried to grow vegetables directly on their roofs , but the soil had destroyed their homes			1
" our challenge was to convince people to understand the greenhouses and that the soil would n't be directly on their roofs , " he said			0
@entity10 said she was one of those initially skeptical , but had no doubts once she saw the difference it made to her life			0
" in the beginning i did n't think it would work , " she said			0
" but once i tried it i saw it was a good idea and would encourage anyone to have a greenhouse			0

@entity23 have farming *history* but no land to grow produce , says @entity154
rooftop greenhouses save families money on fruit and vegetables
scheme is being expanded to more refugee camps
