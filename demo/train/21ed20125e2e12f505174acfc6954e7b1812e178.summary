-- the @entity2 chapter in @entity3 is calling for an end to the @entity6 state lottery , saying the game drains the finances of low - income ticket - buyers who can least afford it , especially minorities			1
" it 's an addiction , " chapter president @entity13 said			1
" many , many people have actually spent all their money in hope of getting out of a situation , when in fact , they 're getting themselves into a worse situation			2
" she said one man she knew died last week without health insurance			0
" he had an insurance policy , " she said , " and he withdrew all of the funds from the policy , actually , to play the lottery			2
" @entity30 also believes that minorities are disproportionately drawn to playing the lottery			1
" the way things are set up in the store is targeted for black people and poor people , " she said			0
a spokeswoman with the @entity40 rejected that assertion , saying the @entity6 lottery does not target low - income areas specifically and does not market any differently from one demographic to another			1
four $ 1m @entity47 tickets sold in same county , at same chain " our marketing and advertising efforts are designed to reach a broad audience of @entity55 , " spokeswoman @entity50 said			2
@entity30 says her @entity2 chapter is already lobbying lawmakers , as are organizations like the @entity59 that were already opposed to the lottery			1
but at a convenience store in @entity3 this week , some ticket - buyers did not appreciate the idea of losing the option of playing			1
" it 's up to me , " @entity65 told @entity0 affiliate station @entity66 as he stood in line			0
" if i make a certain amount , it 's up to me : should i spend this $ 5 ( on a ticket ) ? or should i go buy a loaf of bread and hamburger to feed the kids ? " professor @entity76 of the @entity77 says low - income people are more likely to play the lottery , not necessarily because they are targeted but because they have more to gain			1
" it 's an opportunity to change your living circumstances , " he said			0
" so for someone who 's already wealthy , it would take a dramatic lottery win -- a @entity86 , let 's say -- to significantly change their living circumstances			2
if someone is of much more meager means , a much smaller win could literally change the character of their living circumstances			0
" adviser to lottery winners : take the money and hush as a result , he said , " i think there is considerable evidence that the poor pay a greater portion of their income on lotteries than the wealthy			1
" statistics show that for the @entity107 lottery in @entity6 , a third of people who make less than $ 20,000 play , but only about a quarter or fewer of people making more than $ 20,000 do			2
and for instant scratch - off tickets , the most popular game , unemployed people were more likely to play than employed people or retirees			0
@entity30 says that means the people who can least afford it are the most likely to splurge			0
lottery players point out that the games are fun to play , and they offer the hope of winning life - altering riches			1
the ticket sales also raise substantial revenues for state coffers			1
" since the first ticket was sold in 1992 , the @entity40 has generated $ 20 billion in revenue for the state , " @entity50 said , " and contributed more than $ 14 billion to the @entity131			0
these are not insignificant numbers			0
" @entity76 said he has not seen evidence that states with lotteries spend more on schools than states without			0
but now that states have come to rely on those revenues , he said , it would be difficult for a state to pull the plug on its lottery			2
" if that were eliminated , " he said , " how difficult would it be politically to come up with the same amount of revenue through other taxes or fees ? " school teachers become secret millionaires with @entity152 win			0
