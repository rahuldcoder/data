-- never mind that @entity1 took an obscure story of flowers and turned it into the masterful 1998 best - seller " @entity4 " ( and was then played by @entity6 in the movie version , " adaptation " )			1
when @entity1 told people she was planning to write a biography of @entity13 , the @entity10 shepherd portrayed in movies and on tv , even her friends were puzzled			1
" whaaat ? " many of them said			0
@entity18 talked with @entity19 about how and why she spent eight years on the trail of one of the world 's most famous canines			1
@entity24 : one man , one mission -- rescuing mutts q. the book is titled " @entity13 : the @entity33 " [ @entity34 ] , but it 's really about the several dogs that played him			1
much like " @entity4 , " it 's also about obsession			1
a : i think i 'm often drawn , whether i realize it or not , to the idea of what drives people			1
what do we love ? orchids have been a source of passion since the beginning of time			0
@entity13 has been beloved and admired and dreamed about for nearly a hundred years			1
the dog and the orchids are both things that very disparate and sometimes unlikely people come together over			2
@entity24 : 33 fall must - reads q. one of the fascinating things about the book is the way it goes off on tangents -- about @entity58 , the 1950s , your own family history -- but still somehow stays on the story of " @entity13			2
" why did you construct the book this way ? a : i think writing a book is very much a performance			0
i 'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking , i ca n't believe i 'm reading a book about a tv dog			2
where i hope you end up is : oh wow , this is an amazing story and i never thought about the culture this way			0
or i did n't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s			0
i just hope that people will get excited about learning all these things the way i did when i was writing			0
@entity81 what 's the biggest misconception people have about @entity13 ? a : either that there was only one dog -- who miraculously lived for 80 or so years , i guess ! -- or the exact opposite : that there was no real dog , just a character			1
@entity24 : middle - school girls give stray dogs a second chance @entity81 were you surprised by how emotionally attached you got to the story ? a : what has always fascinated me and what 's very emotional to me is the question of what lasts			0
people want to , if not live forever , have evidence of their existence live forever			0
and i think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this , and i started thinking about memory , the idea that things come and go and then they 're gone and forgotten			0
but @entity13 , by being reinvented over and over in people 's imaginations , became kind of a timeless model : he just keeps going and going ; his story outlives everybody			1
i feel great tenderness toward the people who devoted themselves to @entity13 and his history because i think everybody wants to have had their existence noted by the universe			1
@entity24 : 5 books everyone should read at least once @entity81 okay , in the great " stones or @entity125 ? " tradition , tell us : are you a @entity13 person or a @entity130 person ? a : i think you can love both dogs , even if you have an allegiance to one			2
i have no statistics to back this up , but my guess is that @entity13 had more boy fans and @entity130 more girl fans ; after all , @entity130 was female , supposedly , and the setting of her story was more domestic , including a mother , whereas @entity13 was definitely male , living in an all - male world			2
maybe they represented opposite ends of a spectrum -- @entity130 was about love and nurture , @entity13 about loyalty and bravery			2
my dirty secret is that i did truly love @entity130 -- but i feel i 'm being unfaithful to @entity13 by confessing that			1
