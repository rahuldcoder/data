-- the worldwide burgeoning of obesity and diabetes , including in developing nations , is causing increasing alarm			1
this week , the @entity6 is bringing attention to these and other noncommunicable diseases at the @entity10 meeting in @entity11 on the prevention of noncommunicable diseases			1
but global funding shortfalls , the reality that obesity and diabetes affect the rich and middle class more than other socioeconomic groups and the absence of a proactive civil society will create few incentives for politicians in developing nations to take @entity6 resolutions seriously			1
according to the @entity26 , worldwide obesity rates have more than doubled since 1980			0
in 2008 , 1.5 billion adults were overweight ; of this , 200 million men and about 300 million women were obese			0
of the global population , 65 % live in countries where being overweight kills more people than being underweight			0
and in 2010 , nearly 43 million kids under the age of 5 were overweight			0
the numbers are just as staggering for diabetes			0
the @entity26 claims that roughly 346 million people worldwide suffer from this disease			0
in 2004 , an estimated 34 million people died as a consequence of it			0
this week , the @entity10 will establish new policy resolutions that nations should adopt , with a focus on three key areas : to acknowledge the rising incidence and consequences of these health threats , to strengthen national institutional capabilities as well as policies for prevention and to foster greater international cooperation			1
delegates will also discuss the creation of a @entity6 monitoring framework that will track the growth of noncommunicable diseases			2
@entity6 are also expected to agree formally that by 2012 , they will submit their policy recommendations and commitments to the @entity10			0
what 's the big deal about this meeting ? it 's a big deal because this will be only the second time that the @entity6 has convened to discuss health issues			1
the first time was in 2001 when it addressed the hiv / aids crisis			2
including a focus on obesity and diabetes is also significant because it is the first time that these health issues have reached this level of @entity6 attention			1
previously , obesity and diabetes were addressed only through @entity26 regional reports and conferences , most recently with the @entity26 's 2004 report " @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity84 , " which failed to garner the attention of the entire @entity6 system			1
the assembly meeting is also significant because , as the governing body of the @entity89 and the @entity26 , the @entity6 sends a clear message to these institutions that they need to increase their financial and technical support to combat these health threats			2
but will developing nations take the new @entity6 resolutions seriously ? probably not , and for several reasons			1
the first simply has to do with the availability of international funding for obesity and diabetes , especially when compared with hiv / aids			1
the focus on @entity101 has created an international bias in favor of committing more funding for @entity101 rather than obesity and diabetes			2
international financial support for obesity and diabetes has been minimal at best			0
the @entity6 's @entity110 recently stated that most bilateral and multilateral funding does not provide funding for obesity , diabetes and other related noncommunicable diseases , while only 0.9 % of the $ 22 billion spent on international health is provided for these diseases			1
what 's more , the assembly 's draft resolution does not make the need to raise funding for obesity , diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases a priority			2
also , because the resolution says nothing about creating a new @entity128 for noncommunicable diseases , there is serious doubt that increased financial support will emerge			0
second , in many developing nations , obesity and diabetes is still seen as an epidemic that mainly affects the rich			1
when most of the population is malnourished , politicians do not see a need to introduce new legislation for obesity and diabetes			0
in some nations , such as @entity145 , obesity is seen as a sign of good fortune			0
but ignoring the diseases will contribute to high health care costs , especially as nations strive for universal coverage and as the rich and middle classes grow			2
finally , developing nations are unlikely to respond to new resolutions because there is little civil societal pressures to do so			1
in most nations , no proactive , well - organized civic movement has emerged in response to obesity and diabetes			2
while some exceptions exist , such as @entity164 's @entity163 in @entity165 and @entity145 's @entity166 , they lack adequate funding , domestic and international support			0
the @entity6 meeting this week will certainly raise a lot of eyebrows and draw attention			1
but until the @entity6 and other international bodies commit serious financial resources to help developing nations tackle obesity , diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases , until governments overcome their political perceptions and until civil society mobilizes and pressures governments for a response , high - end @entity6 meetings will only succeed in doing what they do best : writing reports , venting complaints and pointing fingers			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity193 : @entity6 meeting this week to address diseases , including obesity , diabetes
after hiv / aids , it is only second time @entity6 has addressed health issues , he says
@entity191 : developing nations not likely to take these @entity6 resolutions seriously
he says developing nations need funding , motivation to tackle obesity , diabetes
