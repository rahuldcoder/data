-- an @entity2 man who says he was fired for exposing public corruption received broad support from the @entity6 @entity5 on monday in a free - speech dispute testing workplace protections for government employees			1
in hour - long oral arguments , the justices dug into a case of whether such first amendment rights extend to state workers who testify truthfully at trial , but are later punished by their employer			1
" @entity19 employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work , " said justice @entity17			0
" in other words , expecting that people will know things because they work in a place and that they can take what they know as a result of working " in the public sphere , and say so when subpoenaed			1
" a ruling in favor of the man at the center of the legal fight , @entity36 , could make it easier for prosecutors to pursue official public corruption allegations where the cooperation of government workers is often a key factor			1
in 2006 , @entity36 was directing a state - funded training program to help at - risk youth , coordinated through @entity45			1
an audit he performed found someone on the payroll was not showing up for work and had done virtually nothing for the program			0
but this was no ordinary employee : @entity53 was also an @entity2 state legislator			1
@entity36 says he tried to work with @entity53 to perform her job duties			1
but he alleged she threatened him , and said he was cautioned by colleagues not to confront someone with her political influence			0
nevertheless , @entity36 fired her			1
the @entity60 stepped in and began a separate criminal investigation , looking at how @entity53 , 69 , was able to secure the community relations job with the program			1
she was paid $ 177,251 from february 2003 to october 2006			0
federal prosecutors charged the retired teacher with fraud			0
she was convicted , received a 30 - month prison term , and was forced to resign from office			0
@entity36 was later terminated from his government job , prompting him to sue the college president			1
at arguments , @entity36 's lawyer , @entity72 , told the justices that his client " testified about events " that he learned about at work			0
" the testimony itself was not a part of his job responsibilities			1
" it amounted to someone speaking as " a citizen on a matter of public concern			0
" but several justices questioned whether the law was clear at the time of the firing to hold the college president liable for damages			1
and some justices wondered whether a public official should enjoy broad job security when testifying in court			2
" so what happens in a situation where a police officer gets on the stand and in testifying honestly admits to corruption , but does it in a slovenly way , comes to court dressed in a clown suit ? " said justice @entity97			2
" could the employer fire him then ? " yet it was the attorneys for the college presidents who received the toughest questioning			2
they said government workers do not deserve the " full free speech rights " enjoyed by others			1
" that seems counterintuitive to me			0
why do we put people at risk for telling the truth ? " asked @entity97 again			0
" to tell the truth about something ? and i 'm assuming if they lied , they could be fired			2
" chief justice @entity126 said @entity36 had no choice but to testify as ordered			2
" what 's he supposed to do ? he says , ' gosh , if i answer , i 'm going to lose my job , or could and if i do n't , or answer falsely ' " he could in turn be prosecuted by the government , said @entity126			2
" but you are suggesting he can be fired if he does it			2
" the @entity5 has previously said such workers can not sue over an adverse job action such as a firing or disciplinary action , when speaking on facts learned " pursuant to their official duties			1
" they can only make such claims when they speak as a private citizen			0
but oral arguments revealed the court was likely to carve exceptions for employees compelled to testify under oath about matters of public concern			0
the case is @entity151 ( 13 - 483 )			0
a ruling is expected by early summer .			0

case involves man working at @entity2 college who says he was fired for exposing corruption
do first amendment rights extend to state workers who testify truthfully but are later punished ?
@entity5 has previously said such workers can not sue over an adverse job action in certain cases
