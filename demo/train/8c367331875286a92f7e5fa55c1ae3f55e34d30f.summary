-- " if he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake			0
that will be punishment -- as well as the prison			0
" @entity7 a year after @entity8 played @entity9 at @entity10 in an @entity12 game there is no sign of the rancor in the racism case involving @entity17 and @entity19 diminishing			1
rancor which has prompted despair from media commentators at the systematic abuse players dish out to one another , their refusal to engage in the pre-match handshake ritual and abusive tweets from players and fans alike			2
prior to @entity9 left - back @entity33 labeling the @entity34 as a bunch of twats in the saga , players ' union chief @entity30 , who is the @entity32 chief executive , likened the dispute to a " mafia feud " , while former @entity34 chairman @entity40 believes is is " unconscionable " the case has rumbled on for nearly a year			1
last month @entity9 captain @entity17 was handed a four - match ban and a $ 356,000 fine by the @entity34 after being found guilty of racially abusing @entity8 defender @entity19			1
@entity17 's punishment came just days after he announced his retirement from international football , claiming that @entity47 's governing body had made his position within the national team " untenable "			1
in july , the 31 - year - old defender had been found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offense at @entity52			2
however the @entity34 requires a lower burden of proof than an @entity56 court and it took the decision to bring @entity17 before its disciplinary system			1
published last week , the @entity34 's 63 - page report into the case made for uncomfortable reading as it detailed the dispute and its subsequent fall out over the last year			1
racism remains " significant " problem in @entity56 football prior to punishing @entity17 , the @entity34 also had to deal with another racism case , handing @entity69 striker @entity68 an eight - match ban and a Â £ 64,000 fine after finding the @entity72 guilty of racially abusing @entity74 defender @entity73			1
the rights and wrongs of @entity68 's punishment and of the @entity17 case -- should the @entity34 , for example , have charged the @entity9 captain after he had been cleared in a court of law -- have been played out endlessly in the media and across social - networking websites like @entity85			1
but @entity17 's punishment and his perceived bitterness regarding the way he has been treated also raises questions about the way the @entity34 , indeed all sports organizations , punish players			1
why for example does any punitive action taken not incorporate a rehabilitation approach as recently suggested by @entity32 chairman @entity96 ? with black youth unemployment approaching 50 percent in some areas of @entity99 , why does n't the @entity34 insist that @entity17 spends a significant number of hours working within an inner - city community project ? likewise why does n't the @entity34 donate @entity17 's fine to grassroots projects actively involved in building better community relations ? @entity104 defends @entity17 in racism case the @entity34 's position is that it is a not for profit organization and all the money that it makes goes directly back into football , either through the professional game structure or directly as investment back into the grassroots structure			1
" there does n't seem to be much appetite for creativity from the @entity34 , " @entity114 , executive director of @entity115 , told @entity0 , after being asked whether a " rehabilitation " approach might be more productive in the long term			1
" rehabilitation is a fundamental principle of @entity125 justice and we still believe in it , " added @entity114			0
" that is how our justice system works and the idea of rehabilitation should be applied to @entity56 football			0
" the @entity17 case has dragged on for so long that it has allowed for some very mixed messages to come out , so i think a rehabilitation sanction is a really good idea			1
" what can we think of that allows him to feel that he is not being persecuted ? " @entity69 's @entity68 fined , suspended over racist remarks however , one @entity12 footballer has reservations about such an approach			0
" i think that in principle the idea is a noble one , " said the @entity144 , who writes anonymously about his experiences of playing in the @entity12			0
" how would the @entity34 pick an organisation or youth team without being biased ? " it 's a bit like politics -- nobody is happy with the current situation but nobody seems to have a practical alternative			2
" i think the @entity34 are bound by what they can and ca n't do from a legal standpoint			2
fines and bans are written in to contracts and players agree to the possibility of this action when they sign a specific contract with the @entity34			1
" most players do this anyway			2
every team has a ' in the community ' vehicle that it uses mainly to capture the next generation of supporters and players			2
" all players take it in turn to meet the kids , answer questions , give out awards and play in a little game with them			2
" you wo n't read about that though because it is n't very interesting			0
down the rabbit hole : depression in the @entity12 " we 're talking about punishment for racist abuse here			0
i certainly do n't feel that coaching a group of kids for a week is a suitable punishment			0
" as a parent would you want your black or @entity197 child to be coached by a player that is only there because he has been charged and subsequently convicted of racist abuse ? i do n't think i would			0
" the @entity144 insisted that there was nothing more professional footballers hated than missing games			0
" missing games hurts footballers more than any other punishment , if we are to buy in to a zero tolerance approach , then the punishment needs to fit the crime and we should not be scared to level 10 game bans for players found guilty of racist abuse			0
" sanctions in recent years it has been argued that leading sports bodies have not always been consistent in the way players , clubs and or federations have been sanctioned			0
in november 2011 , @entity221 fined the @entity222 $ 52,000 for its fans ' racist abuse of @entity47 players during a @entity227 qualifier in @entity228 in september last year			1
fast forward to @entity227 and @entity221 fined @entity230 's @entity229 $ 125,800 for exposing boxer shorts adorned with the logo of an online betting company as he celebrated scoring against @entity235			0
likewise in november , @entity237 president @entity236 suggested that players who have been racially abused should shake hands with their opponent upon the final whistle and move on			0
a new approach ? over in the @entity244 , various different sports have been testing the water in trying to come up with different ways of punishing miscreant players			1
notably the @entity248 wants to penalize divers or " floppers " for repeated violations of an act the league says has " no place in our game "			2
players will get a warning the first time , then be fined $ 5,000 for a second violation			2
the fines increase to $ 10,000 for a third offense , $ 15,000 for a fourth and $ 30,000 the fifth time			0
six or more could lead to a suspension			0
however , the players ' association plans to file a grievance with the league office and an unfair labor practice charge with the @entity269 , arguing that it should have been consulted first before the new rules were implemented			0
that @entity248 approach might win the support of @entity274 manager @entity273 , who called for the @entity34 to punish @entity69 striker @entity68 for diving after a 0 - 0 draw at @entity278 on sunday			1
@entity280 's @entity279 has also been coming down hard on cheating players in the @entity244 , but retrospectively every week the committee -- a body of five people whose names are not public -- announces suspensions and fines for actions that were not caught by the referee in the previous weekend 's games			1
the league owners want to change the culture of the league from being " physical " to more " creative " , but the players are unhappy that the league is " re-refereeing " games			0
meanwhile , back in @entity47 , intriguingly it is understood that a " rehabilitation " approach could be considered by the @entity34 in the future			1

fallout from racism case involving @entity17 and @entity19 shows no sign of going away
@entity17 was handed a four - match ban and a $ 356,000 fine by the @entity34
@entity310 lost his job as @entity47 coach ; @entity17 lost the @entity47 captaincy and then retired
in the @entity244 the @entity248 and @entity280 have begun to *explore* new ways of punishing players .
