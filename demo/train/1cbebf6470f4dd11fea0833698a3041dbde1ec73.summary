a team of international investigators is exploring a site for chemical weapons when a sudden explosion rips through the air , scattering the workers and terrified civilians , who make a frantic run for cover in the ensuing chaos			0
in a split second , this group of inspectors from the @entity13 have become de facto field medics , scouring the scene for survivors and administering first aid to those injured in the blast			1
it is only after the inspectors have dressed the wounds of all the victims that an instructor appears and tells the men he is satisfied with their performance			2
and although this is merely a training exercise being acted out in a foggy field in central @entity31 , the lessons inspectors learn here could potentially save lives on their next deployment			1
@entity13 inspectors have been tasked with cataloguing and monitoring the destruction of all of @entity38 's chemical weapons			1
they have been in hostile environments before , but never as a war is still raging on the ground			1
the conflict in @entity38 has claimed at least 100,000 lives since 2011 , and dozens more are being killed every day			1
exclusive : inside an @entity13 chemical weapons lab @entity46 is the head of training for @entity13 inspectors in @entity31			1
" we are performing our inspections in the middle of a conflict , " he tells @entity50			0
" we 've never done this before			0
it 's not something you could have foreseen two years ago and planned for			2
" this hostile environment training course , conducted by the @entity31 army , is teaching @entity13 inspectors to identify dangerous situations and to avoid getting kidnapped , but also to help if they witness violent events -- knowledge that may be indispensable in war - torn @entity38			1
in august , snipers opened fire on a convoy of @entity69 experts investigating a suspected chemical weapons attack in the suburbs of @entity72			0
one @entity69 vehicle was disabled in the attack , and the inspectors were forced to turn back			2
@entity76 , the head of hostile environments training for the @entity31 army , believes the biggest threats could emerge when the inspectors move into areas contested between rebel fighters and the regime forces of @entity38 president @entity84			1
" we have different players in @entity38 and i think [ it will not be ] easy for the trainees here , " @entity76 tells @entity50			1
" they have to be prepared for ambushes , but also fighting might break out in some areas			0
the key is to try and get out of those situations quickly			0
" the @entity13 , which has been on the ground in @entity38 since october 1 , was awarded this year 's @entity96			1
the organisation has two branches			0
one is comprised of the laboratory scientists who analyze field samples and send them to other independent partner labs for separate analysis			0
the other branch is the inspectors who catalogue stockpiles of chemical weapons , oversee their destruction , take samples after alleged attacks and speak to witnesses on the ground			2
many inspectors have a background in science , but their ranks are also made up of logistics experts , weapons experts who identify munitions that may have been used to deploy chemical weapons , and health and safety experts to make sure the teams do not get overexposed to potentially dangerous chemicals			2
twenty - five inspectors from 17 nations have taken part in the training program in @entity129 , @entity31 this week			1
the head of training tells @entity50 he is happy with their performance			2
" they identified what had happened and quickly helped everyone			0
i think they did really well			0
" but as realistic as the training was , it was just an exercise			0
and the next stop for some of inspectors could be one of the most dangerous places in the world .			0
