@entity2 must shake off its romantic view of @entity4 and accept @entity5 is a competitor as much as a partner and capable of the same exploitative practices as the old colonial powers , @entity1 's central bank governor has warned			1
reflecting the shifting views of a growing number of senior @entity2 officials who fear the continent 's anaemic industrial sector is being battered by cheap @entity4 imports , @entity10 cautions that @entity2 is " opening itself up to a new form of imperialism "			1
" @entity4 takes from us primary goods and sells us manufactured ones			2
this was also the essence of colonialism , " he writes in the @entity24			0
his remarks are among the most trenchant yet by a serving @entity2 official about the continent 's ties with the world 's second largest economy			2
trade between @entity4 and @entity2 was worth more than $ 200bn in 2012 , 20 times what it was in 2000 when @entity5 committed to a policy of accelerated engagement			1
it has been a period of strong growth partly thanks to @entity41 demand for @entity2 resources			0
but a boom in commodities , services and consumer spending has coincided with the relative decline of @entity2 manufacturing from 12.8 per cent to 10.5 per cent of regional gdp , according to @entity51 figures			0
@entity2 leaders and the @entity53 have recently urged governments to work with each other to ensure they maximise benefits from relations with their leading trade partner , but they have traditionally cloaked their concerns in emollient diplomatic language			1
in contrast mr @entity10 has thrown down the gauntlet to @entity5			0
" @entity4 is no longer a ' fellow underdeveloped economy ' , " he writes			0
" @entity4 is the second biggest economy in the world , an economic giant capable of the same forms of exploitation as the west			0
@entity4 is a major contributor to the de-industrialisation of @entity2 and thus @entity2 underdevelopment			1
" an experienced private sector banker , mr @entity10 is credited with cleaning up @entity1 's banking system after a crash that wiped out 60 per cent of bank capital in 2009			1
he has also given @entity1 's central bank a more activist role , providing concessional refinancing to banks exposed to manufacturers and small and medium enterprises struggling to service high - interest , short - term loans			1
in his article , mr @entity10 argues that @entity2 countries must respond to " predatory " trade practices -- such as subsidies and currency manipulation -- that give @entity4 exports an advantage			1
he also says the continent must build infrastructure and invest in education so that @entity2 businesses can compete for continental trade as @entity4 labour costs rise			1
" @entity4 is losing that advantage as its economy grows and prosperity spreads , " he writes			0
" @entity2 must seize the moment and move manufacturing of goods consumed in @entity2 out of @entity4 to the @entity2 continent ... i can not recommend a divorce			1
however , a review of the exploitative elements in this marital contract is long overdue			0
" his comments come ahead of @entity2 's hosting of a summit of bric nations later this month			2
@entity2 , the largest economy in @entity113 , was incorporated into the bloc of @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity4 last year			2
@entity2 president @entity118 last week warned western companies to shed an old " colonial " mindset when investing in @entity2 and to stop warning against the embrace of @entity4			2
" @entity4 is doing business in a particular way and we think we can see the benefits , " he told the @entity24			0
" but we are very , very careful , " he added , citing @entity2 's experience of colonialism			2
such a relationship he said must " benefit both			0
and this is what we and @entity4 have been agreeing			0

@entity1 's central bank governor warns @entity4 is a rival as much as trade partner
