@entity0 , @entity1 -- the case of the @entity5 hotelier who required @entity8 employees to adopt @entity10 names and avoid speaking @entity11 at work reminds us of the need for balance as we grapple with cultural evolution in @entity17			1
many of us take our name and its pronunciation for granted			1
i imagine i did too -- until i was 5 years old			1
that 's when my dad dropped me off on the front porch of @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity1 , the border town where i was born and raised			2
like any kid on his first day of school , i was engulfed by longing and loneliness , staring forlornly at my dad through the screen door as he walked away			2
when i turned to face the classroom , the teacher 's mouth moved and i heard words , but i failed to understand			1
i did n't speak @entity10 yet , having been home with my mom up until that first day of kindergarten			1
that day my world changed			1
my introduction to the world as baby @entity44 -- the cocooned son of an immigrant mother and an eponymously named first - generation @entity47 father -- had ended			1
my journey as an @entity17 began			2
my teacher , mrs. @entity49 , was a tall , grandmotherly figure with neatly coiffed silver hair and wire frame glasses			1
she ran @entity25 in a modest house she 'd once called home			2
quickly , i felt her casa was mi casa			2
patiently and kindly , she explained that to make us both more comfortable she was changing my name from " @entity44 " to " @entity59			1
" " it 'll be easier for the other kids -- and frankly for me -- to pronounce ! " she smiled			0
i nodded politely , just like my mam√° had taught me			0
i became @entity64 without debate or anguish			1
by the end of the school year i was fluent in @entity10			1
and by second grade i was promoted to the advanced learners class of the elementary school to which my parents transferred me after @entity25			0
there , in a predominantly @entity47 grade school run by @entity75 nuns , i began to wrestle with what my name meant to me , and how i wanted it pronounced			0
i did n't mind " @entity59 " but i did n't like " @entity44 " pronounced in @entity10			1
it just did n't sound right to me			0
call it instinct , or since i was bilingual and my mother rigidly emphasized speaking both languages correctly , perhaps i felt the most respectful and authentic pronunciation of a name should be that of its language of origin			2
thus , i arrived at my own compromise by fifth grade			0
i began to say my name bilingually			0
" @entity59 " in @entity10			1
" @entity44 " in @entity11			1
balance , or the constant search for it , became a hallmark of my life			2
maybe it was because i was reared on the @entity17 - @entity5 border , a place akin to the fulcrum in a playground see - saw			0
to the south thrived my living heritage , which i experienced at home and with my family			0
to the north loomed my future , which i was learning and absorbing at school and in the media			0
it took five minutes to commute from my house in the @entity17 to my abuelos ' home in @entity5 , where i whiled away countless afternoons playing ball beneath a giant avocado tree in the backyard , devouring homemade corn tortillas hot off the plancha , and listening to the colorful yarns my abuelita spun and the wise dichos ( sayings ) my abuelito religiously repeated			0
meanwhile at school , i gobbled up books and determined to someday head north to @entity124 and make my way as a productive @entity17			0
and all along , as i introduced myself , i started my name in @entity10 and switched gears into @entity11 for the second half			1
even though i was bilingual , it took practice			0
you see , different languages employ varying muscles in your mouth and face			0
unseen , but not unheard , the tongue curves uniquely in each language , enabling one to enunciate not only different words but diverse vowel sounds , unique consonants , cadences and accents			0
and the alliteration of " @entity64 " provided a challenge in that the " r " in @entity59 flows smoothly in @entity10 , while the " r " in @entity44 rolls like a locomotive thundering over the old railway bridge that spans the @entity148 in @entity26 , often backing up traffic for miles			1
that quick change - up from @entity10 to @entity11 when pronouncing my brief , four - syllable name stopped me in my tracks more than a few times , causing my cheeks to flush with embarrassment at the struggle of pronouncing the name i had not chosen in the way i had chosen			1
but , despite the difficulty , i persevered			0
try quickly repeating " @entity64 " 10 times bilingually			1
it 's a bicultural tongue twister , a " trabalenguas " as they say in @entity11			1
so i practiced some more			0
until i got it right			0
a smooth " r. " a rolled " rrrr			0
pronounced completely in the native tongue , a name could be interpreted as a sign of a person 's unwillingness to embrace @entity17 culture and integrate fully into society			2
on the flip side , translated entirely into @entity10 it can give the impression that one is trying to hide his or her heritage , that perhaps the past is a source of shame rather than pride			1
the story of the innkeeper stirred my memory			2
surely , it 's no surprise that when a child finds challenge in something as simple as their name , he or she will likely also face a complex path in crafting an identity as a multicultural @entity17			0
but what i take from these experiences is that an extreme approach in either direction is not the most constructive , healthy strategy			0
cultural evolution and acculturation take time and involve compromise and negotiation , in the hearts and minds of individuals as well as within our broader social discourse			0
the key to attaining the right balance is empathy			1
the secret to maintaining it is practice			0
if the innkeeper had taken an empathetic , compassionate approach -- like mrs. @entity49 did with me -- he might have elicited a more positive , collaborative reaction from his staff , media and observers			0
in the end , if we achieve balance , we can enjoy the best of two worlds -- creating a new one that acknowledges our past while cultivating our future			2
a funny thing about " balance			2
" while it sounds different in @entity10 and @entity11 , in both languages it is spelled the same way and it holds the same meaning			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity64 .			1

hotel owner who asked workers to take @entity10 names *sparked* a memory for @entity64
he says his teacher changed his name when he was 5 years old
@entity44 says he kept @entity11 pronunciation for his last name
@entity264 to *adapting* to a different culture is balance and empathy , he says
