-- neither his name is known nor a motive for the grisly crime he allegedly committed			0
but what is clear is that the @entity8 soldier , a staff sergeant in his 30s , faces grave accusations unlike others faced by @entity8 in @entity11 so far			1
he is alleged to have killed 16 villagers , nine of them children , in the sanctuary of their homes deep into the night			2
the dearth of information from the @entity8 military heightens speculation by the day about the accused soldier and his mental condition			1
what soldier could commit such a heinous act ? authorities and mental health experts caution against drawing conclusions , but what 's known is that the soldier was on his fourth combat tour			1
he served in @entity31 three times and potentially was at risk for combat stress symptoms -- anxiety , depression , anger			1
he also suffered a brain injury in a vehicle rollover , though the extent of it is unclear			0
" we 're going to look into all of that , " gen. @entity42 , who commands @entity8 and @entity44 troops in @entity11 , told @entity0 , declining to say more			1
the full details will likely surface after the military investigates and begins legal proceedings			2
" it 's a tragedy all the way around			2
there 's no question about that , " said @entity53 attorney @entity52 , who told @entity0 thursday that he was representing the accused soldier			1
" i think it 's of interest that we have a soldier who has an exemplary record , a decorated soldier who was injured in @entity31 to his brain and to his body , and then despite that , was sent back			1
i think that 's an issue			2
i think it 's a concern			2
" @entity70 , a civilian lawyer who has represented @entity8 soldiers in military murder trials , said sunday 's shootings in the villages in kandahar province represented the worst of chilling incidents involving @entity8 troops			1
@entity79 : massacre could prompt attacks in @entity8 there have been cases of the innocent who are mistakenly killed or die in the crossfire			1
but it was shocking to @entity87 to hear of a @entity8 soldier turning his weapon on civilians			1
if true , he said , the crime amounts to no less than executions of people inside their homes			0
the soldier could face 16 counts of premeditated murder , @entity70 said			1
the officer who will preside over the soldier 's @entity103 , the military 's rough equivalent of a grand jury proceeding , will decide whether to try it as a capital case			1
there has to be at least one aggravating factor -- such as the accused knowingly created a grave risk of substantial damage to @entity8 national security -- in order for a death penalty proceeding			1
army sgt. @entity113 was sentenced to death for carrying out a grenade and rifle attack on his comrades in @entity118 during the opening days of the @entity31 war , killing two officers			1
prosecutors sought the death penalty for pvt. @entity123 , who raped a 14 - year - old @entity31 girl and murdered her and her family , but a jury could not reach a unanimous decision , and @entity123 received life in prison without parole			1
other than those two cases , @entity70 said he could not think of another instance where a soldier was condemned to die for murders committed on overseas combat tours			2
the soldier accused in sunday 's shooting spree has been transferred to @entity118 , where he is likely being detained in solitary confinement			1
the military will consider several factors in determining a location for the trial			0
among them will be key witnesses , forensic evidence and expert testimony			0
prosecutors , @entity70 said , may push for the @entity103 hearing to be held in @entity11 so that witnesses from the villages where the killings took place are able to come to court to testify			1
they are unlikely to do so if the hearing is held outside @entity11 and lawyers on both sides will have to rely on depositions			1
but a hearing and then a trial in @entity160 could present security risks with angry @entity11 clamoring for the accused 's head			1
" i do believe security is going to become a problem the longer he is in the country , " @entity70 said			0
" there 's a chance someone is going to kill him			0
you 'd be a national hero if you killed this guy			0
" given the risks , the military could decide to hold the trial in the @entity8			1
if so , it would most likely be at @entity177 near @entity178 , @entity179 , where the soldier was stationed			0
@entity70 said the military will probably order a full sanity probe in this case			1
that entails comprehensive interviews with the soldier , his family , friends and colleagues by three mental health officials , including a forensic psychologist			2
@entity70 has defended soldiers charged with killing @entity31 and @entity11			1
among them was pvt. @entity193 , one of five @entity197 soldiers also based at @entity177 , charged with belonging to a rogue " kill squad " that targeted civilians			2
he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 24 years in prison			0
@entity201 said the soldiers in his squad carried out the executions on the spur of the moment			0
@entity70 said he was struck by the brutality of killing children inside their homes but is somewhat surprised these sorts of crimes do n't occur more often			0
some soldiers are on medications			0
since 2001 , many have had no lives other than to deploy over and over again			0
others struggle to find tangible successes to their mission			0
sometimes , @entity70 said , they despise the people they have to defend			0
" take the postal worker and multiply him by a million			0
that 's a service member , " he said of the stress			0
some people have suggested the soldier accused in the @entity225 village shootings suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder or @entity228			1
but @entity229 , a professor of psychiatry at @entity231 and a former @entity233 psychiatrist , said the violence against others is not usually considered a part of the cluster of symptoms associated with @entity228			2
" so i think it 's more likely that we 're going to discover that there was some either psychotic illness or delusional condition or some evidence that this person was more seriously deranged or impaired than we would typically see in @entity228 , " @entity229 said			2
neuropsychologist @entity246 , co-author of " military psychology : clinical and operational applications , " said more than 1 million people in the @entity8 suffer a traumatic brain injury each year			2
many experience problems , but execution - style killings are not among them			0
" so while it 's possible that ' brain damage ' is a contributing factor , it is unlikely to explain the slayings , " @entity246 wrote on @entity0			0
a convenient answer , he wrote , would be to explain the slayings as the act of a bad apple who temporarily lost his sanity			0
" if that were the case , then no military leader or peer could have predicted the rampage , " @entity246 wrote			0
" however , one ca n't help but wonder whether the recent spate of events , including the desecration of @entity272 corpses by four @entity273 , the burning of the @entity275 by @entity8 troops and now the slaying of @entity11 civilians point to the toll that the @entity11 war is taking			1
has the psychological impact of the long war been underestimated ? " and there is another question circulating after @entity11 president @entity285 urged @entity8 troops to withdraw from village outposts and international forces to hand over security control of the country by 2013 instead of the planned 2014			1
how will sunday 's shootings affect the @entity8 role in the war ? " this may be the end of our mission in @entity11 , " @entity70 said			1
on the streets of @entity11 , angry people thirsted for justice			2
but that could be a long time coming			0
@entity70 predicted that at the very least , it would take a year for a trial to begin , probably longer			0
and given the current situation , time may preclude a trial from taking place in @entity160			0
the @entity8 military might be long gone by then			2
@entity0 's @entity308 and @entity309 contributed to this report .			0

new : attorney : the soldier was injured in @entity31 and , " despite that , was sent back " into battle
a @entity8 soldier accused of killing 16 @entity11 civilians has been moved to @entity118
he has not been charged yet , and it 's not clear where he would be tried
the @entity233 will probably conduct a full probe of the *suspect* 's mental condition
