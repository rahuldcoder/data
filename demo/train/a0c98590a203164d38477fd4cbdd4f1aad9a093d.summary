@entity0 -- clerks scheduling medical appointments for veterans were " cooking the books " at their bosses ' behest to hide the fact some had to wait weeks , if not months , for appointments , a va scheduler in @entity0 said thursday			1
the @entity11 confirms to @entity1 that it has staff investigators on the ground in @entity0 looking into the allegations			1
the allegations surrounding this @entity15 comes as the federal department fends off claims of potentially deadly delays at other facilities , including claims of a secret wait list in @entity22 that was first reported by @entity1			2
@entity24 officials deny secret wait list ; doctors say they 're lying the @entity24 's official policy is that all patients should be able to see a doctor , dentist or some other medical professional within 14 days of their requested / preferred date			2
any wait longer than two weeks is supposed to documented			0
yet @entity34 , a @entity36 scheduling clerk based in @entity0 , said thursday that some who called to make appointments at his facility did end up waiting longer , yet such delays were never reported			1
for example , he said , they might be told the next available appointment was n't for several months			2
it would be scheduled for then , but marked in official files as if the patient had put off their appointment until then by choice			0
" what we 've been instructed was that -- they are not saying fudged , there is no secret wait list -- but what they 've done is come out and just say ' zero out that date , ' " @entity34 said			0
the " zero , " in this case , suggests the patient did n't have to wait at all			0
" it could be three months and look like no days ( wait ) , " he added			0
" it looked like they had scheduled the appointment and got exactly what they wanted			0
" the @entity36 public affairs office said that @entity34 's allegation has been looked into , without any finding of wrongdoing			2
" based on our internal fact - finding conducted april 25 - 28 , we found the claims by this employee were not substantiated , " the @entity24 statement said			1
however , the @entity11 says it is conducting its own investigation			0
@entity34 tells @entity1 he has already been interviewed by @entity11 staff			2
the claim comes amid strong public pressure on the @entity79 @entity36 and its leader , @entity80 , after @entity1 reporting unveiled e-mails that allegedly discussed the destruction of a secret list of veterans waiting for care at a @entity87			0
@entity80 has ordered a " face - to - face audit " at @entity24 clinics , a department spokesman said on thursday			1
earlier the same day , a @entity92 committee voted to @entity93 in the wake of such accusations that his department is responsible for deadly delays in health care			0
@entity80 orders ' face - to - face audit ' at clinics @entity34 told @entity1 that he 's become a witness in an investigation by the @entity24 inspector general 's office focusing on delayed care , alleged falsification of records and possible medical harm to veterans at the @entity0 facility			1
@entity34 , a former @entity111 soldier himself who still works at the @entity24 , said he has asked to be protected under federal whistle - blower laws			1
as to the @entity24 's earlier fact - finding efforts , @entity34 said that no one asked him about his allegations			1
in fact , he said , when he began expressing his concerns to other staff members , he was called in and told not to e-mail another person			1
" they shut me up the very next day , " @entity34 said			0
