government that chooses non-payment over the lives of its citizens			2
this week 's $ 200 million demand in return for the lives of two @entity15 citizens perhaps represents a change of tactics from @entity18 -- the group that now rules over large parts of @entity21 and @entity22 -- as they realize that , with the notable exceptions of the @entity25 and the @entity26 , the willingness of @entity29 nations to resist making some form of payment in the face of @entity34 videos of their citizens begging for their lives is weak			1
is an unwavering resistance towards ransom payments a constructive position to take ? is offering no hope of some form of negotiated settlement in the best interest of a nation 's citizens ? or would it in fact make more sense to take a flexible approach that operates on a " case - by - case " basis , engages in negotiation , and considers all possible options including ransom ? the arguments against payment are well - rehearsed and oft - repeated by those that attempt to hold the international line			1
since 9/11 the attempt to starve terrorist organizations of financing has been a cornerstone of the global effort to counter these groups			0
payment of ransoms to terrorist organizations for the safe return of citizens is thus entirely contrary to the blizzard of national and international laws and norms that have emerged			2
at a 2013 summit in @entity76 , world leaders noted that the " international community has made significant progress in combating the flow of funds to terrorist organizations , " but also drew attention to the substantial financial benefit being earned through ransom payments and the incentive this provided for further kidnappings			2
following the @entity89 , and notwithstanding the fact that in 2009 the @entity91 reminded @entity92 of their obligation to prevent the payment of ransoms to terrorists under @entity96 , the @entity88 passed a further resolution in january 2014 calling upon @entity92 " to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments			2
" without doubt , paying ransoms encourages more kidnappings -- it is a self - perpetuating , self - reinforcing cycle			0
the @entity25 administration argues that " hostage - takers looking for ransoms distinguish between those governments that pay ransoms and those that do not ... and make a point of not taking hostages from those countries that refuse to make concessions			1
" be that as it may ( and proving a counter-factual is always highly subjective ) , the murder in 2009 of @entity26 citizen @entity112 by @entity113 -- whilst his fellow @entity115 and @entity116 captives were freed following the reported payment of a substantial ransom -- shows that refusing to pay is risky			1
furthermore , the procession of gruesome beheadings visited on @entity25 and @entity26 hostages by @entity18 in 2014 suggests that , in the knowledge that the @entity25 and @entity26 will not pay ransoms , captured citizens from these two countries are far more likely to be murdered in the pursuit of propaganda			1
a willingness to negotiate while paying ransoms increases the risk of further kidnappings , it also clearly increases the likelihood of a safe and successful outcome			0
offering to consider ransom demands introduces a critical prerequisite for success -- namely , a willingness to negotiate			1
the secretive world of kidnap - for - ransom ( @entity142 , in industry parlance ) insurance provides a source of instructive insight			2
this industry bloomed following the kidnap , ransom , and death of the 20 - month old baby son of @entity25 aviator @entity151			1
at the heart of the growth and success of this niche industry is its ability to respond to and engage with kidnappers , normally via intermediaries			0
success is judged not only by the safe return of a captured individual but also by the ability to negotiate a price that is far removed from the opening ask			0
knowing that ransom payments to designated terrorist groups are illegal , @entity142 specialists will quickly pass insured situations involving terrorist groups to government authorities -- and the outcomes are rarely as favorable as those that can be achieved via expert negotiation			2
periodically the facts presented to policymakers change and policymakers must adapt			0
such a moment for adaptation has arrived			0
kidnap - for - ransom is an increasingly widely - used tool by terrorist groups			0
@entity182 , leader of @entity184 - based @entity183 , which is estimated to have earned $ 20 million from ransom between 2011 and 2013 , asserts that " kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil " and " a profitable trade and a precious treasure			0
" in several recorded messages , @entity113 leader @entity190 has called for supporters worldwide to kidnap @entity193			0
stomach - churning ( and illegal , in most jurisdictions ) as it may be to finance designated terrorists , in recent months , citizens of @entity195 , @entity116 , @entity196 , and @entity197 have returned safely home			1
citizens of the @entity26 and the @entity25 have not			1
the point blank refusal to pay ransoms is wrong - headed			1
a more nuanced approach that leaves all options , including payment , open for negotiation is much more likely to result in success .			0

@entity18 has kidnapped more than a dozen @entity29 citizens in recent years
some @entity214 countries are known to pay , but the @entity25 and @entity26 do not
@entity216 : @entity25 and @entity26 are wrong to dismiss ransom demands out of hand
