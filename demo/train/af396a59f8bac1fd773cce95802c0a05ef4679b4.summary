-- this week @entity1 , the director of the @entity2 , stepped up to the microphone and took responsibility for the worst mistake in @entity8 ' @entity7 - stricken hospital : its utter lack of preparedness			1
after insisting for months that any @entity12 hospital could handle an @entity7 case by following @entity2 guidelines , @entity1 now wishes he had provided @entity15 with the robust @entity2 clinical support team it desperately needed to care for @entity17 -- the first of three people to be diagnosed with @entity7 on @entity12 soil			1
what now ? the federal government 's last major health care scandal -- at the @entity23 -- offers a road map out of this mess , and it begins with finding new leadership for the @entity2			1
the times call for a person with unique talents and vision that @entity1 lacks			1
@entity12 were shocked this spring to learn about falsified treatment numbers and hidden , lengthy wait lists at @entity23 hospitals			0
after a grueling , monthlong drumbeat of bad news , culminating with revelations that veterans died while on those secret wait lists , secretary @entity33 finally resigned			0
his resignation came only after president @entity40 was essentially forced to fire him			0
after helming an agency that similarly proved ill - prepared to meet its most important mission , @entity1 should n't force the resignation issue like @entity33 did			2
in announcing @entity33 's resignation , @entity40 hailed his fine career as a @entity12 army general , and @entity1 similarly came to his leadership post with a stellar resume , the highlight of which is having helped up to a half million people in @entity52 by controlling the spread of tuberculosis			1
he was also the innovative @entity55 health commissioner who took on one of the top health scourges , tobacco , with a smoking ban in workplaces and bars that has now been replicated in many major cities			0
he tackled obesity and cardiovascular disease with a ban on trans fats and rules that chain restaurants post calorie counts -- moves that have also proved popular elsewhere			0
but while at the @entity2 's helm during one of its greatest public health crises , @entity1 has n't demonstrated the same kind of entrepreneurial spirit and foresight that he displayed in @entity55			1
in fact , at times , he 's seemed completely out of touch			2
this weekend @entity1 told reporters : " i 'm not familiar with any prior patient with @entity7 who has undergone either intubation or dialysis , " and speculated that such measures could have increased the risk of contamination surrounding @entity17 's care in @entity8			1
he did n't seem to be aware that @entity90 in @entity91 used both measures in its treatment of @entity7 patients			2
dr. @entity95 , who 's heading @entity90 's ebola team , discussed these procedures in a conference call with hospitals and health care workers tuesday			0
@entity1 's out - of - the - loop status on core clinical details seemed to have pointed him in the wrong direction entirely for a cause of contamination , as further details about the @entity8 hospital 's difficulties with ebola protective garb have come to light			1
in fact , using chocolate sauce as a stand - in for bodily secretions , @entity0 's dr. @entity111 demonstrated how easily self - contamination can occur : while taking off the @entity2 's recommended personal protective gear , he inadvertently smeared his arm and his neck			1
as it leaves necks exposed , the gear does n't compare to the hazmat - style suits aid workers are using in @entity123 , and workers use at @entity90 -- and in fact @entity1 wore such superior protection when visiting @entity127			2
when the first nurse 's infection was announced sunday , @entity1 immediately blamed a " breach in protocol " for her situation			2
it was perhaps beyond his imagination that the @entity2 protocols themselves -- including the training and infrastructure -- failed in @entity8			0
finding an effective way to handle and dispose of medical waste from @entity7 has been a problem as well , and the @entity2 should have solved it long before the first domestic diagnosis			1
the fact that more than 70 health care workers were involved in @entity17 's care points to @entity146 's lack of preparedness ; hospitals that have a plan know it 's essential to limit staff coming into contact with @entity7 patients , who become progressively more contagious the sicker they become			1
in transferring the third patient , @entity155 , to @entity90 , the @entity2 is admitting that @entity146 is n't prepared			0
i do n't think @entity146 is that different from most @entity12 hospitals			0
it has a fine reputation in its community			0
yet it was n't up to the job despite @entity1 's repeated insistence that any @entity12 hospital can do this			1
on the call tuesday with @entity95 , one participant listener from a @entity169 hospital said implementing @entity90 's care recommendations would " bankrupt " them			0
that 's the kind of practical detail leaders need to know to be effective , and @entity1 has proven he does n't			2
@entity1 should have known the closest equivalent to the level of personal protective equipment required by @entity7 in @entity12 hospitals is found in operating rooms , and even that does n't compare			1
in @entity181 we 're mostly concerned about not infecting the patient , and we 're able to remove garb with little fanfare			0
now we 're learning that doctors and nurses treating @entity17 did n't wear the recommended protective suits for two days while they suspected @entity7 but did n't have the diagnosis confirmed			2
why was n't the @entity2 guiding them ? when @entity1 said this week he 'll now send a robust , hands - on clinical team anywhere in @entity12 that @entity7 is diagnosed , i thought , my word , we are n't doing that already ? instead , once his lab confirmed @entity17 's diagnosis , @entity1 provided epidemiologists and contact tracers , and the @entity2 offered passive guidance			1
far too passive , it seems , as @entity201 , the @entity146 nurse , flew to @entity202 , a violation of the @entity2 's guidance on controlled movements while under monitoring , which does n't include such public transportation			1
@entity1 has been playing catch - up for too long			0
in mid-august , his agency touted a total of 55 @entity2 employees on the ground in @entity123 , as if that was a remotely proportional response to the growing epidemic			2
by that time i and other critics had been recommending a military - grade operation			0
it would be another month , when the case numbers had doubled , before the administration would announce such an initiative			0
" we are fulfilling our promise to the people of @entity123 , " @entity1 said back then , in words he must now sorely regret			2
he did n't change his tune and lobby the president for the military option until he returned from a visit to the region several weeks later			0
at the @entity232 , new leadership is in place , and the agency is picking up the pieces			0
@entity12 could use a surgeon general right now , and that we do n't have one represents a failure of our partisan politics			0
but it 's entirely within the president 's authority to identify and appoint new leadership at the @entity2 , the central agency managing this crisis			1
@entity1 is clearly a good man and will go on to do good things			1
but the president must now choose someone better attuned to the crisis leadership role that has overtaken the rest of the @entity2 director 's job description .			1

@entity252 : @entity2 's @entity1 took responsibility for lack of @entity7 preparedness
@entity1 has stellar resume but has seemed out of touch with clinical *realities* in crisis , he says
@entity261 says he 's *lagged* on treatment , protective garb , waste disposal , effort in @entity123
@entity252 : @entity1 's a good man but lacks vision , leadership for this crisis
