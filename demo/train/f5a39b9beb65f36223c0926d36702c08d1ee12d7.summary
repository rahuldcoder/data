-- all @entity1 wanted in a shoe was style and comfort without the frilly bows or flowers			1
she 's a working mother who tends to buy men 's shirts in small sizes and prefers the kinds of casual shoes made for men -- desert boots , moccasins , chukkas			1
she 'll take a pair of shoes or a jacket in olive green or navy blue over lavender or aqua any day			1
" i think a lot of my friends would agree that we do n't want to look like an @entity29 when we go out , " said @entity23 , who lives in @entity24 , @entity25			0
" i 'm all for feeling like a girly - girl but there are ways to do it without being a @entity35 poodle			0
" do n't get her wrong , she likes high heels and dresses , but not in pink			0
so when she could n't find a pair of shoes she liked , she decided to make her own			1
hers are desert boots , moccasins and chukkas made of leather and suede with a kelly green lining to distinguish them from what the guys wear			0
she launched her made - to - order collection in fall 2011 under the name mrs. @entity54 , a nod to @entity56 , the successful menswear accessories brand she and her husband , @entity23 , created in 2009			0
he runs the business while she is the creative force behind @entity56 ' collection of neckties , pocket squares and bow ties , which has earned a devoted cult following among menswear bloggers and the people who read them			0
for mrs. @entity54 , @entity23 is designing for women who blur the line between masculine and feminine , who gravitate toward styles traditionally associated with men : flat shoes with wide lasts , unembellished blouses and button - up shirts , unstructured sweaters and blazers , jeans and pants lacking unnecessary studs , embroidery or whiskering			1
" it 's tomboy style , but that does n't mean it 's not feminine or sexy , " @entity23 said			1
" i think you feel sexy and stylish when you 're wearing something you 're comfortable in			1
" these looks have always been around , cycling in and out with the seasons , but the latest signs show they 're more than just a momentary fad			2
women are looking for shoes , shirts , even neckties that fit them better than their boyfriend 's clothes			1
also , brands are popping up to meet those demands , from the artisanal approach of mrs. @entity54 to mass - market retailers like @entity106 and @entity107 , which have been widely credited with giving " tomboy " fashion broad appeal			2
it 's easy to forget the time before @entity107 or " boyfriend shirts , " times when " nice girls " did n't leave home in pants			2
@entity121 and @entity122 were trailblazers , female fashion icons whose neckties and pants drew stares			0
modern style mavens @entity125 and @entity127 show " tomboy chic " is more than a passing fashion , said @entity130 , creator of the popular " @entity132 " blog			1
just as modern @entity135 women have won the right to vote and compete for the same jobs as men , it 's nothing special for them to dress up in jeans or don a blazer			1
a tomboy is more than a girl in boy 's clothing , @entity130 says in her blog ; it 's someone with an " inherent sense of confidence , rebelliousness and adventure			1
" it 's part style , part substance			1
as brands continue to adapt traditionally masculine styles for the female form , " the new statement on tomboy style is that it 's here to stay , " said @entity130 , author of the 2012 book " @entity132 : beyond the @entity159			1
" designer @entity160 was also drawn to menswear , but she did n't like the boxy fit on her body			0
she also did n't like how women 's fashion was pulled from the racks one season and tossed a few months later , while menswear often had a timeless quality that never fell out of season			1
with her fiance , she started @entity172 , a line of tailored women 's shirts that incorporate masculine features , she said			1
it 's a small collection of eight button - up shirts with a higher collar that does n't necessarily lend itself to an exposed collarbone ; the shirts have side gusset detail typically found in the workwear of the 1940s for reinforcement and brass snaps			2
all of their shirts are made in @entity190 , using denim and cotton sourced from the @entity135			0
" we 're trying to walk that line with a dash of feminism in the fit but clearly masculine in the details , " she said			1
even the necktie is getting a feminine overhaul			2
what makes a lady tie ? the fabric and the width , naturally , said @entity206 designer @entity205			0
his hand - stitched ties have earned him nods from publications like @entity209 and @entity210			0
when the 29 - year - old designer realized that many of his customers were women buying for their significant others , he decided to start creating products they might want for themselves			2
" i 'm hoping maybe they 'll bring in more single women , " @entity205 said , mostly joking , in an interview in his @entity219 studio last month			2
" i think there 's definitely a market for them			2
" not everybody is comfortable with the word " tomboy			2
" some say the spirit of progressiveness has rendered the term archaic			2
when @entity232 hears the word " tomboy , " a particular look comes to mind : strong , independent , rebellious			2
but the chairwoman of the fashion and accessories design department at the @entity240 said the description might need an update			0
" to use a term that includes the word ' boy ' to describe a state of independence and free - thinking for women seems kind of backward , " @entity232 said			1
" the boundaries have changed			0
women are strong and independent and have no sense of preciousness , so why would you use a term like tomboy to describe that ? " perhaps it 's because of the style 's close ties to menswear			1
@entity23 's @entity56 is better - known , but mrs. @entity54 is her passion project			0
( plus , she gets to keep the samples , she said			0
) from the start , @entity23 and her husband decided to keep their products made in the @entity135			0
that was n't hard to do with neckties and pocket square , but it proved much more difficult for women 's shoes , because so few manufacturers were equipped to do what she had dreamed up			1
@entity23 ultimately partnered with @entity278 - based mens ' shoe maker @entity276 , one of few shoemakers in the @entity135 who specialize in classic men 's styles similar to the ones she wanted			1
for her moccasins , she found another family - owned business in rural @entity25			0
with mrs. @entity54 approaching the two - year mark , @entity23 said she has finally hit a groove and found a market			0
" we even get orders from men now , " she said			0
" they say they like the green interior			0
" follow @entity297 on @entity298			0

@entity1 wanted stylish shoes without the frills , so started making her own
she 's designing for women who blur the line between masculine and feminine
@entity307 style is no *longer* a passing fad , " @entity132 " blogger says
some say the term tomboy is *outdated*
