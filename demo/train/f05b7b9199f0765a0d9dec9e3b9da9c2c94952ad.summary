@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity5 filmmaker , screenwriter and playwright , @entity3 has been in the movie business for over 35 years			1
@entity3 on screenwriting : " i do n't make a conventional screenplay ... it 's a whole organic process			1
" in that time , he has been nominated for five @entity13 , as well as winning the @entity14 at @entity15 for " @entity16 " in 1993 , the @entity17 there for " @entity18 " in 1996 and the @entity19 at @entity20 in 2004 for " @entity21			2
" famous for his fierce independence ( read refusal to work in @entity25 ) , @entity3 's work is known for gritty realism and a focus on underprivileged sections of @entity5 society			1
another of @entity3 's calling cards is an unconventional approach to screenwriting			1
" @entity38 " caught up with the veteran director at the @entity35 in the @entity5 earlier this year to ask him more about his approach to making films			1
the screening room : why is this festival so important to you ? @entity3 : i am a filmmaker who is both a writer and director and i have this way of making films where the writing and the actors and the shooting is all combined together			1
i do n't make a conventional screenplay ... it 's a whole organic process			1
@entity38 : what do you think other scriptwriters can learn from you ? ml : i think screenwriters who , because of the politics and economics of the film industry , are forced to work in a much more conventional way , are always fascinated to discuss with me how i work			1
@entity38 : there is this romantic idea that screenwriting has to be a painful , solitary experience			1
that 's not what you experience , though			1
ml : no , i do n't sit in a room writing a script solo			2
my films are highly structured			0
everything you see in my films is very precisely written , very thoroughly researched , but actually it is done through rehearsal , it 's done through improvisation and research			2
i work for six months with the actors before we shoot anything , then the shooting of the film is in itself then an operation of making the film as i go along in a way , although it 's very structured			1
it 's a very sophisticated thing			2
@entity38 : how did you first discover that this way the way you wanted to make your films ? ml : i trained as an actor , i did a lot of theatre work and , of course , the convention of actually rehearsing is much more prevalent in the theater , although actually what i do is n't really theater practice , it 's very film orientated in its nature but it came out of all of those kind of explorations and experiences in the 1960s			1
@entity38 : how important is the audition process for you ? ml : for me , casting is probably more important than it is for most people			0
if someone has written a conventional script then a range of actors could do that role			0
i find actors with whom i can collaborate to create characters , so i have to have actors that are brilliant , who are very intelligent and not all actors are very intelligent , who are versatile , who are character actors and not all actors are , that have a sense of humor , that have a sense of society and commitment , who are n't just narcissistic which a lot of actors are , and people who are patient and courageous			0
working with me on these things is dangerous			0
@entity38 : when you work with actors do you give them over to the idea that they are shaping the story , or do you always know exactly what you want ? ml : i do n't always have a structure , and certainly there is no illusion involved			2
also , i say to each actor when asking him or her to take part , you will only ever know what your character knows , so they never have an overview of the film			0
their actual contribution is as an individual with a responsibility to their character , but my job is to tell the story			0
it 's a very healthy and harmonious division of labor , but certainly , there would be no point in doing it if i did n't set up conditions in which they can really explore and the thing can go in fantastically unpredictable directions			2
@entity38 : when you take a script to a producer , how much should you compromise to get the film made ? ml : i am the least qualified person in the world to answer that because i do n't do that in the first place			0
i mean , i go to backers with my producers and we say , " i ca n't tell you anything about it			0
i have n't got the script			0
give us the money and we will go away and make it			0
" and they either say ' yes , ' which happens just occasionally , or they say ' no ' which happens most of the time			0
so , i never have a situation where anybody interferes or where i have to compromise			0
but just in passing i would say that i have a rule about what one should do in the film business which is never compromise .			2
