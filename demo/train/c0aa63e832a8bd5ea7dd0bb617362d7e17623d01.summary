-- the @entity2 administration on wednesday proposed new tests and standards that would for the first time require child safety seats protect occupants from side - impact crashes			1
the @entity8 said the rules , which are mandated by @entity10 and would apply to all car seats for children weighing up to 40 pounds , could save lives			1
" we estimate that this proposal would save the lives of five children every single year , and prevent over 60 injuries each year , " @entity8 acting administrator @entity14 told a @entity15 gathering in @entity16			0
@entity8 said manufacturers in recent years have begun beefing up car seat structures and adding more padding to protect the head and torso , noting that those products are effective at protecting kids			2
but the government wants protocols in place for testing those products as well as formal performance standards for safety in side - impact crashes , which kill or seriously injure as many children as frontal - impact collisions , the agency said			1
there currently is a federal safety requirement car seats must meet for frontal crashes			2
traffic fatalities involving young children have dropped sharply since the mid 1970s partly due to increasing use of car seats , @entity8 said			1
in data outlined by @entity8 in its proposal , more than 320 children four and younger were killed in all types of passenger vehicle crashes in 2009			1
slightly more than half were in car seats			2
the new sled tests proposed by @entity8 would simulate a " t - bone " crash in which a small vehicle containing a child seat and traveling at 15 mph is struck broadside by another vehicle going twice that speed			2
manufacturers would have to demonstrate that child seats can safely restrain an occupant and minimize force from the accident that is transmitted to the child 's upper body			0
crash - test dummies representing the characteristics of children at ages 1 and 3 will be used			0
@entity8 said in its proposal that real - world data indicate head injuries are most common in side - impact crashes			1
the public will have 90 days to comment once the rules are published in the @entity75			0
comments , especially by industry , could also result in changes and finalizing a rule could take several months at least			0
if new requirements are ultimately put in place , car seat manufacturers will likely have several years to comply with new standards			0
small cars yield mixed results in crash test , but improving overall			0

the @entity8 proposes first - ever side - impact tests for car seats
those types of crashes are particularly dangerous because *doors* can collapse on passengers
car - seat makers are already improving *designs* , but @entity10 has ordered a standard be put in place
more than 320 kids up to age 4 were killed in car crashes in 2009 ; more than half were in car seats
