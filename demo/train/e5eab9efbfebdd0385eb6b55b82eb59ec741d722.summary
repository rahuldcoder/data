@entity0 -- people who regularly use tanning beds may double or even triple their risk of developing melanoma , the deadliest form of skin cancer , according to a new study			1
the study found that people who have ever tanned indoors have about a 75 percent higher risk of melanoma , on average , than people who have never tried it			1
but the risk of melanoma was much higher among frequent and long - term indoor tanners			2
compared with those who had never touched a tanning bed , people who spent more than 50 hours under the lights were three times more likely to develop melanoma , according to the study , which is the largest of its kind to date			2
people who frequented tanning salons for more than 10 years or who logged more than 100 sessions were about 2.5 times more likely to develop the cancer			2
the study comes as an @entity30 advisory panel is pondering tougher regulations on indoor tanning , including use restrictions ( if not an outright ban ) for people under age 18			1
at a meeting in late march , the panel discussed strengthening skin - cancer warnings at tanning salons and moving tanning beds to a class of medical devices that includes @entity45 scanners , among other measures			1
@entity0 : 30 most flattering bathing suits this summer @entity48 , of @entity49 , @entity50 , who was 41 years old when she first learned she had melanoma , told the @entity30 panel that her doctors said her use of tanning beds as a teenager was most likely responsible			1
" even after seeing my surgical scars , my teenage daughters have expressed an interest in using tanning beds , " says @entity48			1
" they 've told me that if tanning beds were that bad , they would n't be legal			1
" the testimony the @entity30 panel heard in march was " pretty compelling , " says dr. @entity64 , a dermatologist at @entity66 , in @entity67 , and a nonvoting member of the panel			2
" this new study adds to the body of evidence supporting the fact that indoor tanning poses significant risks			1
" @entity0 : find the best self - tanner for you teens , however , do not seem to be more susceptible than adults to artificial ultraviolet ( @entity82 ) rays			0
the study results suggest that a person 's melanoma risk is more closely linked to total exposure than to the age at which he or she first tans indoors			1
" given our findings , the age you start indoor tanning may matter less than how much you do it , " says the lead author of the study , @entity93 , a professor of epidemiology at the @entity95			1
" maybe a ban should also be considered for adults			0
" nearly 70,000 people in the @entity105 got a melanoma diagnosis in 2009 and more than 8,000 died from the disease , according to estimates from the @entity109			2
melanoma is deadly because it can invade deep into tissues and spread to other parts of the body , unlike other types of skin cancer , which are relatively easy to remove			0
melanoma is the second - most - common cancer among people ages 15 to 29 , and appears to be on the rise overall			2
the new study , which appears in the journal @entity120 , included nearly 1,200 melanoma patients in @entity122 and a cancer - free control group			0
of the melanoma patients in the study , 63 percent had tanned indoors at least once , compared with 51 percent of the melanoma - free individuals			0
@entity0 : is it a mole ... or skin cancer ? @entity93 and her colleagues also measured the melanoma risk associated with different types of tanning machines			1
compared with people who had never tanned indoors , those who tanned in high - speed and high - pressure machines had roughly three and 4.5 times the risk of developing melanoma , respectively			2
high - speed machines use higher amounts of ultraviolet - b ( @entity145 ) light while high - pressure machines use more ultraviolet - a ( @entity82 )			0
however , the researchers could n't say definitively that one type of machine is more dangerous than the other , because few study participants could remember the exact machines they used and because @entity82 and @entity145 output can depend on factors such as maintenance , not just the model of the machine			0
the new findings seem likely to bolster the government 's efforts to regulate indoor tanning			1
when the @entity30 panel met in march , the foremost scientific evidence was a review of 19 studies conducted by a @entity168 working group , which found that tanning indoors at least once increased a person 's risk of melanoma by 15 percent			1
( for people who started tanning at age 35 or younger , the increase in risk rose to 75 percent			1
) the @entity168 group later deemed tanning devices to be carcinogenic			0
but the organization emphasized some shortcomings in the research , such as the inability of most studies to tease apart the effects of indoor tanning versus sunbathing or to pinpoint how the extent of tanning - bed use -- also known as the " dose " -- affects skin - cancer risk			1

@entity196 , a spokesperson for the @entity197 , a trade organization representing tanning facilities and suppliers , said in an e-mail that unanswered questions remain			0
he noted that vitamin d , which is produced by the skin with moderate uv exposure , may have cancer - fighting benefits			0
" science is still wrestling with this issue and there 's certainly still more to learn , " @entity196 said			0
" we welcome a more complete body of research that will allow us to advise our customers how to achieve their goals without unnecessary risk of exposure			2
" the @entity217 recently charged the @entity197 with exaggerating the benefits of indoor tanning and falsely denying the associated skin - cancer risks			1
according to @entity64 , the health benefits of tanning -- as opposed to limited sun exposure -- are a myth			0
" a healthy tan is an oxymoron , " she says			0
" a tan is simply a response to injury , whether it 's obtained indoors or outdoors			0
