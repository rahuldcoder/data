this year , the event will be all about the games , as developers show what they can do with that new technology			2
some game companies have already shown glimpses of the power of the @entity15 and @entity16 with recent releases like " @entity18 : @entity19 , " " @entity20 , " and " @entity21			0
" @entity4 2014 promises to showcase even more creativity , flair , and dynamic gameplay with a look at upcoming titles arriving in the next year and beyond			1
even @entity29 will be making a splash with its eye toward boosting sales of its own " next - gen " console , the @entity28 u. the company chose not to hold a traditional press conference in 2013 , and has opted again for a digital event and smaller , more intimate meetings			1
but the real question for the expo is , how many of these games will people actually get to play ? @entity1 with @entity1 leading the sales pack with the introduction of its @entity16 console , they will be looking to hold their lead and offer more titles to keep fans interested			1
they also will be showing off more about their latest hardware project , @entity50 -- a virtual reality headset that undoubtedly will be integrated into some of their own titles			1
expect to see more about popular titles like " @entity56 " or " @entity57 , " two games that have been teased quite a bit over the months			1
it is also likely that fans will get glimpses of games like " @entity64 " and a possible new title for the " @entity67 " franchise			2
while @entity1 has n't pushed as much on the music and movie front as their competition , it would be a surprise if @entity73 , their new streaming service , did n't get prominently mentioned			1
with a new @entity16 console / @entity75 handheld console bundle recently announced , cross-play and @entity75 titles will likely be part of every demonstration			0
@entity2 the @entity80 , @entity81 , company has to feel like it has been playing catch - up for the past year			0
fan reaction to some of its @entity15 policies and hardware forced @entity2 into backtracking on many of its @entity4 statements from last year			1
unbundling the @entity91 hands - free controller from the console , along with a price cut , garnered mixed reaction from the public , so expect @entity2 to explain why it was a good idea and how it will influence the user experience			0
a " @entity98 : @entity100 " presentation will surely get everyone 's blood pumping and a new title , " @entity104 , " should excite fans with its colorful and quirky gameplay			0
will there be more exclusive title announcements ? likely , but how many will move consoles is the real question			0
@entity2 has been aggressive in pushing the @entity15 as an all - in - one entertainment center , so do n't be surprised by more content partnerships to be showcased			1
@entity29 @entity29 's struggles with the @entity115 have been well documented			1
the company just ca n't seem to explain to customers why the 2012 console offers a different entertainment experience and is feeling financial pressure to do something big			0
the company is banking on new games to help get more @entity115 's into homes			1
" @entity125 " and a new " @entity127 " game will help			0
there are also rumors of a new " @entity134 " game for the @entity115 and a major new title for the handheld @entity133 console			1
hopefully , they will also give more details about a series of figurine - based games , similar to " @entity139 " or " @entity140			1
" called the @entity141 , a demonstration in may showed a @entity125 figurine being used with different games on the same platform			0
can you imagine the demand for @entity149 - based figurines ? pcs nearly every new game that comes out for the consoles also comes out for the home computer ( well , except for @entity29 )			1
the popularity of " @entity155 , " " @entity156 , " and other massive multiplayer online games has opened up the field for new @entity159 to try their hand			0
with the new games , companies are going to be showing off new bells and whistles for computer gamers -- specialized keyboards and mice , chat headsets , and high - powered gaming laptops and towers			1
it 's a good bet a few booths on the show floor will be packed with the latest and greatest hardware for people who game on @entity179 more games third - party game developers will also be showcasing their talent with promises for this year and next			2
@entity184 just announced a new " @entity188 " title , which should get some play at @entity4 , as well as more about " @entity187 : @entity189			2
" both of those games are likely to be available in 2015			0
@entity192 plans on a mix of updates to classic franchises , like " @entity196 , " " @entity197 , " and " @entity198 , " while planting the early seeds for new , original projects set to blossom over the next few years			0
they will also announce a game from @entity203 that is not another " @entity205 " game , but something brand new			0
@entity207 will be showing off a new " @entity210 " game they said was built specifically for the next - gen consoles			2
they also announced " @entity211 , " an open - world , role - playing game set in the heart of @entity215 , and " @entity216 , " taking the action to the @entity218			0
" civilization : beyond @entity220 " from @entity221 , " the evil within " and " @entity223 " from @entity224 , and " @entity225 , " a @entity227 - produced title from @entity228 are all expected to be shown with more video , more explosions , and more excitement for the fans			0
plenty of other third - party developers will be announcing titles throughout the three - day event			2
what else ? virtual reality gaming is likely to be on the rise with the strides @entity241 has made toward a home headset in the past two years			1
some companies are looking to be the first to produce a blockbuster hit for the @entity246 headset			0
mobile gaming , both on its own and as a companion to console gaming , will get more attention this year as many games produce one - off titles for smartphones or incorporate gameplay into tablets			1
it will also be curious to see how much social - platform gaming is featured this year			0
regardless of what is predicted , expected , or promised , @entity4 always manages to have a few surprises and twists just to keep everything interesting			2
what do you hope to see revealed at @entity4 this year ?			2

the @entity4 kicks off monday in @entity5
with all the new consoles released , games will take center stage
@entity1 hopes to press its *advantage* with new titles , virtual reality
