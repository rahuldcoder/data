-- just 101 miles separate @entity1 and @entity2			1
but one will be the first country in the world to welcome the @entity5 ; the other will have to wait a full day			0
samoans can thank the very crooked international date line for their license to party early			1
the line is an imaginary one dreamed up to help with global time - keeping			0
it splits the globe into two -- so when it 's tuesday morning on the west side of the line , it 's still monday morning on the east side of it			0
until last year , @entity1 and @entity2 celebrated the new year on the same day			1
but then @entity1 hopped west of the line so it could trade more easily with countries such as @entity22 and @entity23			2
because the date line is not fixed by any international law or agreement , it can zig and zag to accommodate such government and business interests			2
@entity2 , however , stayed on the other side of the border -- leaving it 25 hours behind @entity1			0
@entity1 is n't the only place the international date line bends ( quite literally ) its rules for			1
take the tiny @entity36 nation of @entity37			0
before the mid- 1990s , the international date line split @entity37 into two parts , leaving the western portion a whole day ahead of the eastern part and causing headaches when doing business			1

near the top of the globe , the date line veers east to get all of @entity51 on board with the rest of @entity54			1
it then swings far west to lasso in the @entity56 , so they can to be on the same day as the rest of @entity59			2
this means some @entity54 will see 2013 a full day before some @entity61			0
perhaps they can tell their neighbors on the other side of the squiggly line what the future holds			0

@entity1 is 101 miles ( *164* kilometers ) west of @entity2
but @entity1 marks the new year a whole day before its neighbor
the international date line swings more than 1,500 miles east for @entity37
some @entity59 have to celebrate 2013 a day after @entity54 neighbors to the north
