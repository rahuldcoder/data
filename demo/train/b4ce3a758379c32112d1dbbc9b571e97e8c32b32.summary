-- every catastrophe has its unsung heroes			0
in @entity5 's oil spill disaster , one such hero is not a person but a river : the @entity8			1
but the river 's strength is flagging , and unless our leaders change what the @entity14 is doing , things could get a lot worse for our coastal marshes			1
many people know that the @entity8 flows through the @entity19 , @entity19 , @entity20 ; but fewer are aware that this is only one of two paths it takes to the @entity24			1
the @entity8 divides to create its delta upstream of @entity26 at a place called @entity28			1
the @entity29 is the western channel			0
in 1963 , the @entity14 built a dam with sluice gates at @entity28 between the @entity8 and @entity29 to keep the shorter @entity29 route from " capturing " the whole river			1
later , they built more structures to gain better control			0
today , every drop of water that goes down either the @entity8 or the @entity29 marches to the orders of the @entity14 , which traditionally seeks to maintain a constant 70 - to - 30 percent split -- with the larger amount going to the main - stem @entity8 -- between the two river branches , by adjusting the gates at @entity28 on a daily basis			1
@entity45 has the opportunity to sustain discharge on the main stem of the river by altering that rigid 70 - 30 ratio to , say , send 80 percent past @entity19			0
if ever there were a time to switch off " autopilot " and utilize the power of one of our country 's most powerful natural forces , it is now			2
all through may , the river 's discharge past @entity19 increased as spring rains and melting snow from the center of the continent found their way into the river , rising to almost 1 million cubic feet per second			2
like most coastal scientists familiar with the @entity69 , i am convinced that this high spring discharge played an important role in keeping oil from penetrating deep into our marshes during the first full month of the spill			1
discharge from the famous " bird - foot " river mouth has helped keep the oil offshore and to the east			0
similarly , outflows from both banks of the channel through the gates of the @entity84 and @entity85 diversions and other engineered openings have helped to keep oil out of adjacent marshes and in the open bays where it could be collected			2
@entity20 's gov. @entity90 and his advisers showed good leadership in opening those diversions up to full bore as soon as the spill occurred , and that strategy appears to have paid off			2
but since the beginning of june , the flow past @entity19 has dropped by a third due to seasonal changes in climate			0
now , it is likely we could see more extensive oiling of our coastal wetlands			0
with less water coming out of the river , more of the oil arriving on high tides will get deeper into the marshes , where most cleanup techniques do more harm than good			1
can we keep river levels high for a little while longer , buying time for crews to attack the oil in open gulf and bay waters ? yes ! the @entity8 is falling fast , but the @entity29 , which sends water to the coast 150 miles west of the main oil impacts , remains well above normal , as it has been most of this year			1
by closing some gates leading to the @entity29 , the @entity14 could send more water past @entity19 , out to those areas where the oil most threatens the marshes			1
these are the nursery grounds for most of the commercial fish and shrimp caught in the @entity24 , and home to a wonderful variety of resident and migratory birds with declining populations			0
we need to do everything we can to save the marshes , including beginning to manage the river as if the future of the coast depends on it			2
the @entity14 should seek emergency authority from president @entity141 , and the concurrence of @entity20 's @entity143 , to quickly begin to operate the structures at @entity28 to address the drop in discharge on the main stem for at least the next two weeks			1
in the time of the endless oil disaster , all measures are temporary , whether " top hats " or " sand berms			0
" some work ; most have n't			0
we have a limited opportunity to make a difference with the river , the most powerful tool in our kit			0
we do n't know whether it will be tomorrow 's high tide or one next week that brings in the next big dollop of oil , but increasing flow down the river past @entity19 sure makes sense right now			1
and as state and federal agencies begin to plan for long - term restoration of this precious ecosystem , i urge them to remember that we ca n't save the delta without the river			0
the @entity8 , the @entity29 , and yes , even the @entity28 structures have a role to play in restoring life and health to this region and all that it offers our nation and the world			2

high water levels in @entity8 helped reduce spill 's impact on coast , says @entity184
to continue **protect*ion* , flow should be increased by @entity14 , he says
@entity8 can be the biggest weapon we have to *protect* the marshes , @entity184 says
