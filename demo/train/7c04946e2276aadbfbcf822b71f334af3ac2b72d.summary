-- a trial date has been set for may for an @entity3 man accused of killing his new bride during their honeymoon in @entity7			2
@entity9 is scheduled to face murder and kidnapping charges on may 23 in an @entity3 courtroom , court officials said			1
he has pleaded not guilty to the charges			0
@entity7 media dubbed @entity9 " @entity15 " after his 26 - year - old wife , @entity16 , died october 22 , 2003 , while the two were diving at a historic shipwreck off the @entity19			1
the incident occurred about 9,000 miles from @entity21 , @entity3 , where the couple had married 11 days earlier			0
@entity9 returned to the @entity23 after his wife 's death and , five years later , remarried			2
in that same year , 2008 , he pleaded guilty in @entity7 to criminally negligent manslaughter			0
he finished his sentence there in early november and was subsequently held in immigration detention			0
then , in late november , @entity9 was arrested in @entity31 after a grand jury in @entity3 indicted @entity9 on two counts -- murder for pecuniary gain and kidnapping where a felony occurred , authorities said			1
those charges are based on the premise that @entity9 hatched the plot to kill his wife while in @entity3			1
@entity9 's lawyers have contended that authorities in @entity3 manipulated a grand jury to get an indictment against their client			1
the lawyers have claimed that authorities based the indictment on testimony from @entity51 's immediate family and a sole @entity52 , @entity3 , investigator , saying of the witnesses " none could offer more than emotional testimony and hearsay			2
" the doctrine of double jeopardy -- which says that a person can not be tried or punished twice for the same crime -- does not apply in @entity9 's case , according to established legal precedent , legal experts have said			1
double jeopardy does not apply because two separate sovereigns , a state government and a foreign government , were seeking to prosecute , said @entity69 , a @entity21 criminal defense attorney and law school professor			0
@entity7 authorities investigated @entity51 's death for years , according to inquest findings in june 2008			0
@entity74 , @entity75 , coroner @entity76 pressed for charges after determining that the drowning could n't be deemed accidental			0
according to the inquest , @entity9 told @entity80 that his new bride appeared to panic while 45 feet underwater in the reef , 42 miles off the coast of @entity74			0
but @entity76 cited inconsistencies in @entity9 's statements , saying that investigators found that " some of @entity88 's explanations lacked credibility			1
" @entity76 noted that @entity51 's father , in a sworn statement , said @entity9 asked her to maximize her life insurance and make him a beneficiary shortly before their wedding			0
the insurance company confirmed @entity9 asked about his wife 's insurance policy after her death , according to the coroner			2
@entity9 's attorneys have said that their client pleaded guilty in @entity7 only " for failing to rescue his wife ( because ) he merely did not do enough to save her			1

@entity9 faces murder and kidnapping charges
his then - wife , @entity16 , died in 2003 while the two were diving near the @entity19
@entity9 's attorneys have said @entity3 authorities " manipulated a grand jury "
