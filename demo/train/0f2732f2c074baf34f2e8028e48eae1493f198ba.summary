-- the deal struck at the weekend between @entity2 and world powers over its nuclear program is not just a triumph of @entity7 diplomacy , but a step forward in the budding rapprochement between @entity2 and the @entity10 that had been long in the making			1
every @entity10 administration from @entity13 to @entity14 has tried to reach out to @entity2			1
unfortunately , these efforts all failed because the circumstances for rapprochement were not quite right -- unlike today , where @entity2 's new president , @entity18 , has been determined to outflank his ideological opponents in @entity21 and reach a deal with the @entity23			1
the @entity14 administration seems equally determined -- despite opposition from @entity26 and @entity27 , as well as an obstructive @entity28 -- to welcome the @entity2 back into the international community , so long as they agree to play by the rules			1
this is @entity14 's " opening to @entity32 " moment and he must seize it			1
ever since @entity2 students stormed the @entity34 in @entity21 on november 4 , 1979 and initiated the 444 - day @entity2 - hostage crisis , the @entity10 and @entity2 have been regional arch - nemeses			1
even so , in the thirty years since this traumatic event , there have been periodic efforts to improve relations			0
the first episode occurred in 1985 when @entity27 officials helped facilitate a back - channel approach to so - called @entity2 " moderates " , represented by @entity45			0
this led to the infamous " @entity47 " , where senior @entity10 officials traveled to @entity21 to trade weapons and spare parts in exchange for the release of @entity10 hostages held in @entity54			0
details were leaked to the press , leading to the @entity58 , which nearly brought the @entity13 administration down			0
after @entity61 's election in 1988 , the @entity10 reached out to @entity2 once again , saying in his inaugural address , " @entity63 begets goodwill "			1
@entity61 implied that if the @entity2 regime helped the @entity10 obtain the release of the hostages , he would respond with gestures of goodwill			2
upon @entity45 's election as president in june 1989 , he announced that he would help the @entity10 obtain the release of the hostages , which was done in late 1991			1
but goodwill did not beget goodwill			0
when the hostages were released , the @entity10 did not do anything			0
during @entity76 's first term , @entity10 - @entity2 relations first underwent a deep chill			1
following the @entity78 , the @entity10 sought to " contain " @entity2 and @entity79 , even though @entity2 had disarmed itself following the @entity80			2
the policy , known as " @entity82 " , was confusing			0
it advocated @entity10 playing a costly balancing role , when in fact the @entity10 needed @entity2 to balance @entity79 and vice versa			2
but the landslide election of @entity88 in 1997 led to a major thaw in @entity10 - @entity2 relations			1
like @entity18 today , @entity88 sought to open up to the @entity10 , telling @entity0 that " all doors should now be open for such dialogue and understanding and the possibility for contact between @entity2 and @entity10 citizens			1
" @entity76 seized this opportunity and exchanged letters with the @entity2 in 1999 , but regime hardliners undercut @entity88 and rejected the @entity10 overture			2
after the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , the @entity2 people -- much to the surprise of @entity10 officials -- poured into the streets in solidarity with the @entity10 people			2
as @entity10 officials prepared for war they were shocked to find @entity2 ready to help			2
according to @entity108 , a former @entity10 official , the @entity10 and @entity2 worked closely together after the toppling of the @entity110 to establish the post-war @entity112 government			2
unfortunately , @entity113 squandered whatever goodwill had been achieved by including @entity2 as part of the so - called " @entity116			0
@entity117 » even so , the @entity10 still made progress on the nuclear issue			0
in may 2003 , @entity2 sought to trade @entity7 acceptance of its right to a peaceful nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief , assistance in stabilizing @entity79 , and cooperation against @entity127			0
but the @entity10 rejected @entity2 's proposal , undermined the @entity88 government , and ruined any chance of achieving a lasting deal			1
when @entity14 came to office in 2009 there was great optimism that he could achieve a major breakthrough			1
this was because @entity14 had indicated during his election campaign that he was willing to talk directly with @entity2			1
in march 2009 , @entity14 sought to bolster moderates inside @entity2 in the lead up to the june 2009 election by speaking directly to the @entity2 people			1
unfortunately , the regime 's hardliners had no interest in seeing another reformist return to power and rigged the election , crushed the civic - minded protests against the regime , and ushered in another four year term for @entity151			0
the election of @entity18 in june 2013 has turned @entity10 - @entity2 relations on its head			1
like @entity88 in 1997 , @entity18 stunned the @entity23 with a charm offensive , condemning @entity157 's use of chemical weapons , wishing @entity159 a happy @entity160 , and releasing political prisoners			0
@entity18 's objective was clear : he wanted sanctions relief in exchange for a compromise over his country 's nuclear program			0
to this end , he found a willing partner in @entity14			0
this remarkable opening culminated in @entity14 's famous telephone call to @entity18 at the end of the @entity174 in late - september , the first direct communication between @entity10 and @entity2 leaders since 1979			1
these exchanges set the stage for the nuclear deal reached over the weekend			0
after decades of intense hostility between the @entity10 and @entity2 , calmer heads have finally prevailed			2
only time will tell if the @entity10 and @entity2 can build upon this interim agreement and establish a working relationship , which is in the best interests of the region			0
more importantly , this deal stands as a lesson to the war hawks that diplomacy actually works			0
