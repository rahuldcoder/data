-- days after the @entity4 ran aground off @entity6 's coast , details of the harrowing escape from the ship are still fresh in survivors ' minds			1
here are some of the accounts they shared with @entity0 : @entity11 of @entity12 , @entity13 : " it was n't until approximately 30 to 40 minutes after the collision that we finally heard announcements being made , and in @entity18 , we heard that they were saying everything was under control ... that there was an electrical problem with the generator			1
my husband and i looked at each other and said , ' they 're full of it			1
we have to get off this boat			2
' " @entity29 of @entity30 , @entity31 : " i kept telling my parents and i kept telling everybody else , we need to go			0
time is of the essence			0
we need to get on ( a lifeboat ) as soon as possible because it continued to tilt			0
what happened was , when we finally got on the lifeboat , it took several minutes to get everybody on ... people were screaming and crying and they had us count			1
" @entity43 of @entity44 , @entity45 : " we managed to get to a lifeboat that was n't being overrun and the crew tried to keep us back and we felt all this pressure coming from behind ... stampeding , trying desperately to save their lives ... babies crying ... the siren was unbelievable			1
it was so piercing that the children and babies were screaming at the top of their lungs while everybody else was screaming to try to be heard			0
it was like the disaster movies			1
" @entity61 of @entity30 , @entity31 : " when the ship was listing ... we had to climb up and pull a human chain to pull ourselves up on to a stairwell			1
... another couple turned around and gave me their baby , and said , ' take my baby			1
' and i held a 3 - year - old and i was holding on and the ship was moving and i was afraid the child was going to go down the stairwell			1
and i knew -- i looked at my husband who 's been in the @entity75 , and he said , ' this is it , ' and i handed the baby back to the parents and said , ' be with your baby			1
' " not one person from the ship assisted us in any matter			2
there was n't one officer			0
we got on a lifeboat that would n't function			0
we were all thrown out of the lifeboat and thrown against the walls of the ship			2
we crawled down under to try to get on the other side of the ship , because they said that if we got on the other side , we could get a lifeboat			2
and at the time , the ship shifted again , and we were thrown back			2
" we had to crawl back out			0
we had to climb a 20 - foot ladder			0
... the real heroes were the people , the other passengers on board that lifted us up			2
and we had to go through crates of things			0
and then we get to the top of the ship , and we 're up there with about 10 people			1
the rest of the people have left the ship , and you see coast guards and flashing lights , and you think they 're coming for you , and the next thing you know , they 're taking somebody from the bridge and airlifting them out			1
and we 're standing there with our lights flashing and yelling , ' save us , save us ! ' " @entity120 of @entity44 , @entity45 : " the staff , you know , they seemed younger than me			1
they did not know what to do			0
they got on the lifeboats			0
they could not even drive the lifeboat			0
there was someone that jumped into the water , climbed onto the lifeboat and began to maneuver it to drive off			0
because we thought we were going to die			0
