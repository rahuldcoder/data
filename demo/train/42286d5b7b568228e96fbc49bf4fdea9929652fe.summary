-- saturday was @entity1 -- the unofficial @entity3 holiday where we wait for a fuzzy rodent to tell us whether spring will arrive early or if we 'll have to endure another six weeks of winter			1
relying on the weather predictions of a groundhog may seem like a strange tradition , but the practice dates back to medieval times			2
the superstitious believed that hibernating animals would emerge from their long winter slumber to check on the weather on @entity15 , which is halfway between the winter solstice in december and the vernal equinox in march			0
they believed that if the animals saw their shadows , winter would continue , and so they went back to sleep			1
but if they did n't see their shadow , an early spring was on its way			1
famed groundhog @entity25 did not see his shadow saturday morning in @entity28			1
neither did his fellow foreteller @entity31			1
in honor of this quirky @entity3 tradition , @entity32 invited people to take a snapshot of their own shadows for a one - day photo challenge and then share their personal weather predictions			1
@entity40 says she is tired of the frigid weather in @entity42 , @entity43 , and hopes for an early spring			1
" unfortunately , my shadow predicts a longer winter weather , " she said			1
" that means we have to be patient , bundle up more and wait for the spring to come in time			2
" but @entity48 predicts the exact opposite			0
" actually , i believe that temperatures will warm up a bit early this year because of the brutal sub-zero temps all across the country , " he said			0
@entity54 , who recently returned to @entity55 , @entity56 , from @entity57 , says he has not seen snow in a long time			0
i would like to see a good , deep snow where i live			0
on the other hand , i love spring and how the flowers pop up , trees begin to leaf out , " he said			2
" there is such a freshness to spring			2
" @entity65 , a long - time resident of @entity66 , @entity67 , predicts a shorter winter , too			2
" we do n't really have a true winter here , " she said			0
" @entity71 is going to come early as usual			0
buds should be on the trees very soon			0
" @entity74 contributed to this story .			0

@entity25 *misses* his shadow on @entity1
@entity31 also says spring is on the way
