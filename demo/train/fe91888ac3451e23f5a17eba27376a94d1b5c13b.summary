-- if you thought it was difficult managing your own money in 2007 , consider the pressure of the task when you 're dealing with $ 1.8 trillion of client assets			1
@entity7 has made @entity9 's list of the @entity10 every year since 2002 that 's what @entity7 does as chairman and chief executive of @entity15			1
she joined the banking industry as a research analyst , but quickly rose through the ranks , gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way			2
dubbed the " @entity24 " of @entity25 , ms @entity7 was credited with restoring investors ' faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm @entity30			1
she joined @entity31 in 2002 , and spent some time as chief financial officer before taking up her current role in march 2007			2
@entity7 has been a regular entrant on @entity9 's list of the @entity36 -- in 2007 , she made number 12			1
@entity38 caught up with ms @entity7 in @entity39			1
he asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the @entity43 ( @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , the @entity50 and the @entity51 )			0
@entity7 ( @entity52 ) : i think what 's happening right now , it 's fascinating because in the @entity51 and in developed @entity57 we 're having a liquidity crunch -- someone might argue a liquidity crisis			1
and in fact , we are awash with liquidity in the @entity63 and in @entity64 as well , so there 's really a bifurcation that 's occurring in the world			1
and if you think about , oil does n't even have to stay at the 90 - plus dollar level it is ; even at levels in the 70 's , 60 's , 50 's , 40 's , a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market			2
yes , the investments are going up globally , but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region			0
and so over time , you 're really going to see ... i think continue to see ... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the @entity63 as well as to @entity64			1
@entity38 ( @entity85 ) : it 's coming almost as a perfect storm ; we have a sub prime crisis , a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years			2
in this window of time , is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of @entity25 and it undermines its role ? ( @entity52 ) : i think there is no doubt that @entity99 is losing its status as a financial capital of the world			0
if you think about some years ago , if you think about the internet bubble for example , where it was @entity99 and @entity107 was n't it ? and you look at a whole range of reasons for it , and the sub prime crisis perhaps , the decline of the dollar perhaps			0
but you have overlapping regulators in the @entity51 , you have very high taxes in the @entity51 , you have a very litigious environment in the @entity51 , and you have the emerging markets coming up , so capital is being raised outside of the @entity51			0
these things , some of which are negative for the @entity51 , some of which are positive for the other regions , is accelerating a shift that was underway from @entity99 , to @entity125 , to @entity126 , to @entity127 , and potentially to @entity39 as well			0
( @entity85 ) : some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both @entity25 and @entity130 in @entity131			0
you ca n't have your cake and eat it too			0
you ca n't say i want some of that liquidity but i only want part of that liquidity			0
what is the result of that do you think ? can you over-regulate the sovereign funds ? ( @entity52 ) : oh , i think you can over-regulate the sovereign funds			0
i think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well ; where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of ' here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity '			0
and the concern is if , gee these are going to be important going forward , we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets , but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market -- to a market outside the @entity51 or @entity57 for example			0
( @entity85 ) : it 's fascinating because if you look at @entity168 or @entity169 or @entity170 , the stock markets have almost had like a one way path ; there 's been some correction here in the @entity63			1
but what are we likely to see here , stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way , or an implosion because of the rapid gains ? ( @entity52 ) : i think you 've got to separate the idea of what 's going on in the real economies and what 's going on in the market places			2
they move together , but sometimes they separate , they diverge , and they can diverge for a long period of time			0
if you look at economic growth potential of the @entity63 , of @entity64 , of @entity197 , we feel very bullish about this			1
and i was making the point earlier today , @entity199 has been growing at 11 or 12 percent , not for one year or two years , but literally for 30 years			0
for 30 years it 's been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see			2
so , say the same thing for the @entity63 , the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant , but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward			1
( @entity85 ) : is @entity25 , or for that matter , @entity125 or any other financial center ready for a woman -- for example in your case , 1.4 trillion dollars of assets ... ( @entity52 ) : 1.8 thank you ... ( @entity85 ) : ... to run one of the major money center banks of the world ? i 'm sure you 're feeling this pressure even though you 're young by international standards			1
are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank ? ( @entity52 ) : well it looks like the @entity51 may be ready for a woman to take over as president			1
so i think if we 're ready to potentially have a woman run the country , i think we are getting ready as a country , to potentially have a woman run a money center bank			1
now , you know , the board would n't ask and i would n't accept , but if you look across @entity25 , there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are ceo 's who move along , and i think it 's a very exciting development for the industry and for the country			2
