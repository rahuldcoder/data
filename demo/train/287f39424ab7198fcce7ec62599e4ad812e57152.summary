-- as oil continues to pour into the @entity3 following the deepwater horizon oil rig explosion , comfort may come from an unusual direction : the largest oil spill in history			1
between five and 10 million barrels of oil poured into the @entity10 in 1991 when @entity15 troops , retreating from their occupation of @entity13 , set fire to desert oil wells and opened the valves on oil rigs and pipelines			1
the spill -- at least five times the most recent estimate of that spilled in the @entity3 -- devastated marine wildlife and coastal habitats in @entity13 and @entity26			1
yet , against all the odds , the @entity10 appears to have shown amazing resilience in response to the ecological disaster			1
@entity31 is a marine specialist with the @entity32			2
he was in neighboring @entity26 as oil began washing ashore on the beaches			2
it had flowed south along the coast from @entity13			0
" it was huge , " @entity31 told @entity0			0
" it 's hard to describe for people who were n't there but it was basically a coast of black			0
" by the time @entity26 authorities and international contractors initiated clean - up efforts , pumping oil from the sea into holding areas , much of the oil had sunk , evaporated or washed up on beaches , according to @entity31			2
" you would see oil on the beach or along the shoreline in the water , but it was n't there for more than about a month , " he said			2
but oil slicks had an immediate and catastrophic impact on local wildlife			0
@entity62 , science and research manager at the @entity67 's @entity66 office told @entity0 that researchers estimate 30,000 water birds were killed by the oil			1
fish eggs and larvae were killed by slicks , which in turn reduced the breeding success of some bird species by 50 percent in the year after the spill , he said			1
more on oil spills : read about @entity80 's ' @entity79 ' but , according to researchers , in the years following the spill the @entity3 's ecosystem began to make a remarkable comeback			1
a 2008 joint @entity86 - @entity26 research paper on the effects of oil pollution in the @entity10 stated that by 1994 , fish and bird populations had returned to pre-spill levels			1
whale , dolphin and turtle populations were largely unaffected , according to the same study			0
the fishing industry was decimated after the oil spill and @entity15 mines made the @entity3 a no - go area for @entity13 and @entity26 fishermen			1
but , it too , had started to show signs of improvement by 1994 , the same study shows , and is widely considered to have made a full recovery from the after effects of the spill today			1
" what they found , and they 've found in other places in the world , is that nature does recover , " said @entity31			2
although a colossal amount of oil was released into the @entity3 , @entity31 said up to half may have simply disappeared from the water by a combination of evaporation and degradation by bacteria in the sea			1
in the @entity10 , the local climate -- very hot and humid for most of the year -- would have helped			2
@entity122 of @entity123 has studied the impact of the spill			0
he told @entity0 : " if you have a higher air / water temperature the lighter fraction of the oil , which is more toxic , evaporates , and the heavy fraction , which is least toxic , goes to the bottom			0
" " that 's why with an incident like the @entity137 , although in terms of volume it was far less than the spill in the @entity10 , in that part of the world , because of the colder water the impact can be stronger			1
" the lighter fraction stays there for a longer period and can inflict a lot of damage compared with hot areas			0
" nonetheless , the oil spill has left the @entity3 with some scars that have not yet healed			1
@entity122 said coral reefs have been damaged , particularly off the coast of @entity26			0
and the heavier oil fractions , which do n't evaporate or dissolve , have sunk into coastal sediments			2
a 2003 @entity156 study found huge quantities of oil in the sediment of salt marshes , mudflats and mangroves on the coast of @entity26			2
@entity163 , of @entity13 activists @entity165 , told @entity0 she feared that oil buried in beach sands could be released by the erosive action of coastal currents			0
it 's a fear shared by @entity122 , who said studies are being carried out to test the likelihood of that occurring			0
so , can any lessons from the @entity10 spill be applied to the ongoing @entity3 spill ? according to the latest @entity156 government estimates , up to 855,000 barrels of oil have spilled into the @entity3 since a 5,000 - foot - deep well erupted after an explosion and fire aboard the @entity182 drilling rig on april 20			1
@entity183 " there are probably similarities [ between the spills ] , although it 's too early to tell , " said @entity31			0
" one issue in the @entity3 is the sunken oil -- whether that ever makes it up on the surface and on the shores , or will it just sink to the bottom			1
" in terms of the clean up , i think some coastal habitats are just way too fragile to be touched			0
" some of those coastal marshes will probably be more damaged by clean - up activities than they would be if they were left to deal with the disaster on their own			0
" for @entity205 , the lessons from the 1991 oil spill are all too relevant to the @entity3 spill			1
" if you have an offshore operation you need to have a good contingency plan in case of spillage , damage , earthquake , or a problem with the pipeline			0
" we learned the lesson that we have to have an action plan -- you have to expect the unexpected			0

1991 oil spill in @entity10 was biggest in history
30,000 birds were killed and fish populations suffered
the @entity3 appears to have made a remarkable recovery , although oil has sunk into sediment
nature can recover by itself , according to marine expert
