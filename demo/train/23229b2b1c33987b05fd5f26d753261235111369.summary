@entity0 -- the great government shutdown of 2013 is about @entity3 and budget priorities , but it also is about respect			2
in short , conservative @entity7 @entity6 do n't think they get enough of it from president @entity9 and the @entity10			1
" republicans are now in a position where they do n't want to cave in because it sets a bad precedent that the @entity10 would be somewhat dictating how the @entity7 runs , " @entity6 rep. @entity11 of @entity12 said this week			1
conservative rep. @entity18 of @entity19 went further , telling the @entity20 that " we 're not going to be disrespected			1
" " we have to get something out of this , " he said			0
" and i do n't know what that even is			0
" @entity18 's office confirmed that he said it but issued a statement thursday in which the congressman said he " carelessly misrepresented the ongoing budget debate			0
" @entity9 , however , said @entity18 's comment reflected " reckless " tactics by @entity32 pursuing a purely partisan agenda instead of fulfilling the basic responsibility of @entity35 to fund the government			2
" if you 're being disrespected , it 's because of that attitude you 've got , that you deserve to get something for doing your job , " @entity9 said at a campaign - style event thursday in @entity38 , @entity39			0
at issue is a short - term spending plan that would fund the government in the new fiscal year that started tuesday			0
the congressional stalemate pits a conservative @entity6 wing that wants to abolish the @entity3 against @entity51 trying to protect @entity9 's landmark health care reforms passed in 2010 and upheld by the @entity53 last year			1
add to that the longstanding resentment by @entity6 conservatives who say their constituents and views are ignored by @entity51 and the mainstream media , which also motivates their stand to link funding the government to dismantling @entity3			2
in particular , they want to halt the pattern of the @entity6 - led @entity7 being forced to accede to the will of @entity9 and the @entity51 - led @entity10 , as occurred in the past year over emergency funding in response to @entity65 and when @entity35 voted to raise tax rates on high - income @entity67 despite a conservative pledge against any tax increases			1
however , @entity9 and @entity10 majority leader @entity71 have rejected @entity6 efforts to use the government funding issue and upcoming debt ceiling deadline as leverage in seeking partisan goals such as dismantling the @entity3			1
an unclear @entity6 strategy also has opened conservatives to criticism that their demands created a path to the shutdown without a way of getting out			1
@entity71 told @entity1 chief congressional correspondent @entity84 on thursday that tea party conservatives he described as " anarchists " were setting the @entity6 agenda , with @entity89 going along because he feared that he would otherwise lose his leadership post			2
not true , countered @entity91 rep. @entity91 of @entity92 , who said @entity89 was " in charge of the @entity7			0
" " @entity7 is supposed to be boisterous , " @entity91 said			0
" it 's the area closest to the people			0
it 's a boisterous place , and it has definitely become that as all these voices have to work together to find a coalition			0
" now , @entity7 conservatives take umbrage with the heated rhetoric from @entity9 and @entity71 as frustration has risen with the government shutdown			1
@entity71 also said @entity89 lacked courage for refusing to hold a @entity7 vote on the @entity10 - passed " clean " spending plan -- one with no @entity108 provisions -- that would end the government shutdown			1
@entity9 also challenged @entity89 on the issue , saying thursday that the shutdown would end immediately if @entity89 allowed such a vote			0
" put it on the floor and let every individual member of @entity35 make up their own minds , and they can show the @entity67 people are you for a shutdown or not , " @entity9 said , adding that @entity7 @entity6 need to stop what he called careening from crisis to crisis instead of fulfilling their congressional responsibilities			1
@entity11 said thursday that such criticism harms the prospects for negotiating some kind of agreement			2
" if you want a deal done in the boardroom , you do n't assault people before you walk in , " he said , adding that " you 're talking about human beings " and noting , " the speaker is a human being , too			0

conservative republicans want their voices heard in @entity35
@entity6 rep. @entity11 : caving to the @entity10 again " sets a bad precedent "
the @entity142 wing demands @entity144 provisions in a deal
frustration over the shutdown heats up the *political* rhetoric
