-- @entity1 held off a late charge by @entity3 to top the @entity5 medal table as the eleventh , and final , day of competition drew to a close			1
as many as 70,000 people attended the closing ceremony in @entity11 after a day of action that began in a deluge and ended with @entity3 winning the final gold medal of the games as the baton was passed to the country 's @entity18 , who will be the next host in 2018			1
the highlight of the day was the grueling men 's road race , a 168 - kilometer test of endurance that started in horrendous conditions			0

the final gold of the tournament was won by @entity3 in the men 's squash doubles final			2
but it was n't enough to overtake @entity1 , who won a whopping 174 medals , 58 of them gold			2
yet the closing ceremony had an antipodean feel as @entity3 's @entity18 were handed the honor of hosting the next tournament , before @entity56 performed on stage			1
apparently caught up in the excitement of the moment , @entity3 runner @entity60 crashed the stage during @entity56 's performance , dancing and waving an @entity3 flag before being removed by security			2

" after the chaos that had plagued the @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity69 ran a largely error free games that had been seen by many in @entity75 as a chance to wave its flag on the international stage			1
in september @entity75 votes in an independence referendum to decide whether it should leave the @entity81			0
but with @entity75 's bitterly divided political elite looking on @entity84 's @entity83 , president of the @entity85 , declared the games the " best ever "			1
" the @entity5 are known as the @entity87			0
@entity69 has succeeded in making them even more than that			0
