like many @entity1 , i applauded the news this week that @entity4 had formally declared @entity6 archbishop @entity5 a martyr , paving the way for his beatification , the final step before sainthood			1
@entity5 was assassinated in 1980 by a right - wing death squad after preaching against the government 's oppression and human rights violations -- what @entity1 call " the preferential option for the poor			1
" to me , @entity5 is already a saint , and i am lucky enough to have made a pilgrimage to @entity20 to see the chapel where he was slain while celebrating @entity22 and to his nearby living quarters , where his blood - stained clothes remain			1
just outside the capital , along a dirt road , is another place of pilgrimage , one for four other martyrs			2
it is where four @entity32 churchwomen -- @entity35 @entity34 and @entity36 , @entity38 sister @entity37 and lay missioner @entity39 -- were raped , killed and buried just months after the assassination of @entity5			1
while much has been made about the slow pace of @entity5 's sainthood cause , especially after the fast - tracking of now - blessed @entity45 , there has been little outcry about the need to open sainthood causes for these women			1
a @entity51 spokeswoman told me the order is not aware of anyone officially pursuing canonization of any of the four churchwomen			0
and the @entity38 of @entity57 have not opened a cause for @entity37 , said sister @entity59 , president of the order			0
" that does n't mean we wo n't consider doing that moving forward , especially in light of the announcement about @entity5 , which we are all certainly happy about and has been a long time coming , " she said			1
i believe @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity37 and @entity39 's commitment to the poor in the face of grave danger that ultimately led to their death qualifies them for consideration to sainthood			2
who were the four @entity32 churchwomen ? @entity34 , a @entity76 , had joined the @entity51 order in her 30s and had worked in @entity80 in the 1970s in the wake of the @entity83 - backed military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government there			0
responding to pleas for help from @entity5 , @entity34 left for @entity6 , only to learn about the archbishop 's death while en route			1
@entity34 was later joined by @entity68 , also a @entity76 , who had entered the @entity90 at 19			0
by the time she went to @entity6 , @entity68 was an experienced missionary , having served the poor in @entity94 for 20 years			1
both women were returning from a regional meeting of their religious order in @entity98 on december 2 , 1980			2
they were met at the airport by @entity37 and @entity39			0
@entity37 had been engaged to be married before joining the @entity100 in @entity57			0
she worked first as a teacher , then joined a mission team in @entity6 in the early 1970s			2
@entity39 , a laywoman , grew up in @entity104 and was working for an accounting firm in @entity57 when a spiritual search led her to the diocesan mission project in @entity6			1
all four women served the poor at a time when the @entity6 government had become increasingly suspicious of the church 's work among the people			1
after leaving the airport on that fateful night , the women 's car was stopped by @entity119 , who beat , raped and shot them			0
although several lower - level guardsmen were convicted , a @entity122 truth commission concluded the men responsible had carried out the killings on orders from above			0
are they not martyrs also ? as with @entity5 , some @entity1 question whether these women were killed in odium fidei , literally " in hatred for the faith			1
" traditionally this has meant death for refusing to renounce one 's @entity136 beliefs			0
in august , @entity4 told reporters that one of the questions the @entity142 congregation faced with @entity5 's case was whether such hatred could also be because of the good works the person did because of his or her belief			2
this week 's announcement about @entity5 seems to have answered that question			2
the @entity1 's process for declaring someone is a saint can be costly and requires support from an organized group , most often a religious order -- which explains why so many founders and foundresses have been canonized over the centuries			0
it also explains why the church has so few lay saints			0
but the lack of an official stamp of sainthood has not stopped @entity1 from honoring the four churchwomen of @entity6			1
books have been written about them , those involved in justice work pray for their intercession , and young @entity1 already choose their names as their confirmation names			2
while @entity5 's heroic transformation from quiet priest to outspoken archbishop is inspiring , he 's not the only catholic killed for speaking out against injustice , oppression and human rights violations during the 12 - year civil war in @entity6			1
among the more than 75,000 @entity6 who lost their lives were six @entity183 priests , their housekeeper and her daughter , who were killed by government forces at the @entity187			1
and these four brave @entity32 women			0
after @entity68 's death , a fellow @entity51 sister is said to have found a poster among her belongings with the words : " follow me , and if you follow me and lose your life , others will follow you			0
" if that is n't the definition of a martyr , i do n't know what is			0
it 's time to make the martyrdoms of these women official , too .			0
