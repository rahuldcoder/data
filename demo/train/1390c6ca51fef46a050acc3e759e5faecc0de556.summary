@entity1 prosecutors say they will appeal after former ruler @entity2 was cleared of charges linking him to the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the country 's 2011 uprising			1
the ruling was a stunning reversal for the ex-president who had been convicted of ordering the killings of peaceful protesters and was sentenced to life in prison for the same charges two years ago			1
on saturday , a @entity17 judge dismissed charges linking @entity2 to the deaths of protesters during the 2011 revolt that led to the end of his 29 - year rule			1
the judge also found him not guilty of corruption			2
the 86 - year - old was stoic as his supporters in the courtroom cheered the decision that capped a months - long retrial			1
reclining on a hospital gurney in a defendants ' cage , he nodded while fellow defendants kissed him on the head			0
later , he told the country 's @entity38 tv station in a brief phone interview that he " did n't commit anything			2
" " i laughed when i heard the first verdict , " he said of the first trial , which he appealed			2
" when it came to the second verdict , i said i was waiting			0
it would go either way			0
it would n't have made a difference to me either way			2
" prosecutor - general @entity54 will appeal the verdict , @entity1 's government - controlled @entity52 website reported sunday			2
also acquitted saturday were @entity2 's former interior minister @entity56 and six of @entity56 's aides , who 'd been accused of being connected to the deaths of 239 protesters as security forces cracked down on them in 2011			1
@entity2 's two sons also were acquitted saturday of corruption			1
@entity2 is still serving a three - year sentence for a previous conviction for embezzlement handed down in may , but it 's not clear when he will be released because he is expected to be credited for time already served			1
@entity68 's efforts to reach @entity2 's lawyer @entity69 for comment were n't immediately successful			1
both sides have alleged that @entity2 's trials have been politicized , with supporters arguing he was unfairly vilified and opponents fearing that he 'd be acquitted as memories of the revolution faded			1
his legal fortunes did seem to parallel the political climate -- just last year , @entity79 , the @entity80 who became @entity1 's first democratically elected president , supported a retrial with the backing of his supporters , who argued @entity2 should have received a death sentence rather than life in captivity			1
but @entity79 himself was deposed by the military in july 2013 , as opponents accused him of pursuing an @entity80 agenda at the exclusion of other factions			0
and now the @entity95 revolt that ousted @entity2 has come nearly full circle -- @entity2 appears close to freedom ; @entity79 is jailed , his @entity98 banned ; and @entity79 supporters allege the current government has returned to @entity2 's authoritarian practices			1
@entity2 cleared , but drama is n't over yet explaining the verdict judge @entity104 said he dropped charges against @entity2 because @entity106 did n't have the jurisdiction to try him for the protesters ' deaths			1
the judge said the case that prosecutors initially referred to the court listed only @entity56 and his aides as defendants -- not @entity2 himself			1
but after mass protests pressured the prosecutor general to question @entity2 , a second referral was made to the court , and the two cases were merged into one			2
lawyer @entity121 , who represents the families of 65 slain and injured protesters , said the inclusion of @entity2 in a second referral should have trumped his exclusion in the first			1
" the judge shied away from directly acquitting @entity2 even though he was accused of conspiring with @entity56 , and @entity56 was acquitted , " she said			1
" the judge resorted to formalities instead			2
" ' i want only @entity133 's retribution ' @entity134 , mother of one of the slain 2011 protesters , sat down on a sidewalk outside the court after she heard saturday 's verdicts , praying to @entity133 to deliver justice			1
she broke down in tears , her hands shaking , as she recalled her son @entity143 , who was killed in january 2011 at @entity17 's @entity144 -- the epicenter of the uprising			2
" i 'm worried my son 's blood would go in vain , " she said			1
" our children 's blood is n't cheap			1
their blood is precious , like any other blood			0
" " i do n't want execution , " she continued			0
" this wo n't bring back my son ... i want only @entity133 's retribution			2
" @entity144 was closed to traffic following saturday 's verdicts			0
one man was killed and nine people were injured as several hundred demonstrators clashed nearby with @entity1 security forces , @entity1 @entity164 spokesman @entity163 told @entity68			0
police fired tear gas and bird shot at the protesters			0
the @entity173 said police were pelted by rocks before the incident escalated			0
the human rights group @entity176 , whose lawyers represented more than 60 civil plaintiffs in the case , said that saturday 's verdict solidified the impunity that it says security forces and their leaders enjoy			0
" justice was dealt another severe blow , " the group said in a news release			0
how it started in january 2011 , throngs of @entity1 filled the streets of @entity17 to decry the country 's poverty , unemployment and repression			0
protesters called for @entity2 to step down but were met by a fierce and often violent government crackdown			1
@entity2 eventually stepped down in february 2011			2
that freed up long - supressed @entity80 movements , including the @entity98 , to run for office			0
@entity79 , backed by the @entity98 's @entity201 , became president in june 2012			0
but @entity79 was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule			0
since then , @entity17 's military - installed government has banned the @entity98 , calling it a terrorist group -- an allegation it denies -- and accusing it of being behind a wave of deadly attacks on police and the military			2
many @entity80 and secular activists have been arrested and given lengthy sentences			0
a restrictive protest law and repeated deadly crackdowns on demonstrations followed			0
@entity218 , the general who led @entity79 's ouster , was elected president in may after leaving the military to run for the office			0
since @entity2 stepped down in february 2011 , the ailing former ruler has appeared in court numerous times on a variety of charges , often wheeled in on a gurney			1
his lawyers say he suffered health problems after his 2011 arrest , including a stroke , and he has served much of his prison time at a military medical facility			0
in may , when a @entity17 court sentenced @entity2 to three years in prison for embezzlement , his sons @entity236 and @entity237 were sentenced to four years each on the same charge			1
all three were convicted of embezzling $ 18 million that was allocated for the renovation of presidential palaces			0
the mubaraks have insisted they are not guilty .			0

a judge dropped charges against @entity2 in the deaths of hundreds of protesters
he was previously convicted and sentenced to life in prison , but appealed
" our children 's blood is n't cheap , " the mother of one of the slain protesters says
@entity2 is still serving a three - year sentence for embezzlement
