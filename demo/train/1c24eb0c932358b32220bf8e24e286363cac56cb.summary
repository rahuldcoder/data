@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 and @entity6 have not offered to go far enough to combat climate change , a top @entity4 official said as a major international summit on the subject opened monday			1
final negotiations at the conference " will be mostly about what will be delivered from the @entity5 and from @entity6 , " said @entity10 , the environment minister of @entity11 , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the @entity4			1
the two countries " together cover half of the world 's emissions , " @entity10 said			0
" it will be absolutely decisive what they can deliver			0
" he pressed @entity5 president @entity25 to deliver more than he promised in a statement in the run - up to the conference			2
" it would be somewhat astonishing if @entity25 would come here and deliver ... just what was promised in last week 's press release , " @entity10 said			0
what is at stake in @entity0 ? @entity25 had been planning to attend the early stages of the @entity0 summit that could lay the groundwork for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions well into the century			1
but the @entity40 announced last week that he would come at the end instead			0
@entity42 , @entity5 deputy special envoy for climate change , defended @entity25 's late attendance , saying the country 's goals extended beyond the summit			1
" the president has put a remarkable amount on the table , " he told a news conference in @entity0			2
" what the president has put on the table is a commitment for the @entity5 to move forward : a commitment on emissions , a commitment on financing , a commitment on engagement -- what we need to now do is see how these negotiations proceed			2
" @entity64 rejected @entity4 criticism saying @entity5 goals for reducing emission went far beyond those offered by the @entity70 bloc			1
he added : " what the @entity5 has put on the table is a trajectory that is not only consistent with , but meets the criteria of a robust scientific outcome			1
" we do n't just have a 2020 number , or a 2025 number , or a 2030 , although we have all of those , we 're moving towards a 2050 number and a trajectory with information in every single intervening year , and we 're moving towards an 80 percent reduction which is what the science is calling for			0
" we look to the @entity4 for a similar kind of long term trajectory			2
" @entity25 's initial plan to attend only the beginning of the conference was criticized by some , including the environmental group @entity92 , which said it is more important that he be there at week 's end			0
" president @entity25 needs to be there at the same time as all the other world leaders -- december 18 , " said @entity97 , a @entity92 spokesman			0
" this is when he is needed to get the right agreement			0
" the stakes could not be higher , the head of the conference said as it opened			0
" within two weeks from monday , governments must give their adequate response to the urgent challenge of climate change , " said @entity104 , executive secretary of the @entity105			1
" negotiators now have the clearest signal ever from world leaders to craft solid proposals to implement rapid action			0
" @entity6 announced last month that premier @entity116 would attend to " fully demonstrate the great importance the @entity6 government attaches to this issue , as well as the political will of the @entity6 government to cooperate with the international community , " spokesman @entity115 said in november			2
@entity6 's @entity124 has announced plans " to reduce the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit " of gross domestic product in 2020 by 40 percent to 45 percent , compared with its 2005 level , state - run media reported last month			1
@entity25 is prepared to offer a goal of the @entity5 reducing emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 , the @entity40 has said			0
the @entity40 also reiterated his goal of reducing @entity5 emissions by 83 percent by 2050			0
in a statement sunday , @entity136 laid out the three layers of action on which he would like governments to agree during the summit : immediate action on climate change , ambitious commitments to cut and limit emissions , and " a long - term shared vision on a low - emissions future for all			1
" @entity25 has discussed the status of climate change negotiations with the leaders of @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 , the @entity40 said friday			1
" there appears to be an emerging consensus that a core element of the @entity0 accord should be to mobilize $ 10 billion a year by 2012 to support adaptation and mitigation in developing countries , particularly the most vulnerable and least developed countries that could be destabilized by the impacts of climate change , " it said			1
the climate talks aim to strike a deal on a successor agreement to the @entity169 , the 1997 pact that has legally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions			1
the @entity5 never ratified it , though more than 200 nations did			0
@entity2 's @entity174 contributed to this story .			2
