-- photographs purportedly showing the blood - spattered bathroom where olympian @entity3 fatally shot girlfriend @entity4 have emerged , apparently showing the scene of the killing for the first time			1
the photos surfaced just days before the double amputee track star is due to appear in court , charged with murdering @entity4 in his @entity12 home in the early hours of february 14			1
the images published by @entity15 show a trail of blood leading from a bathroom ; blood on the walls , stairs and a couch inside the house , and a @entity25 card with " @entity26 " written on it -- @entity4 's nickname for her sprinter boyfriend			1
@entity0 exclusive : @entity29 says @entity3 ' heartbroken ' the photo of the bathroom shows a toilet covered in blood , a door with a missing panel and what appear to be two police - marked bullet holes below the level of the door 's handle			1
@entity0 has not been able to independently confirm the authenticity of the photos , and police spokesman @entity44 declined to comment on how @entity15 obtained the pictures			0
the runner says he thought there was an intruder in the house and , fearful of being attacked , ran on his stumps to the bathroom , where he shot through the door from a relatively low angle four times			2
it was only upon returning to his bedroom , @entity3 says , that he realized @entity4 was not in bed and that she had been the one in the bathroom			1
the state says it was premeditated murder -- that @entity3 had an argument with @entity4 then put on his prosthetic legs , walked to the bathroom , and shot through the door from a relatively higher angle , intentionally killing his girlfriend			1
@entity0 's @entity66 says a number of questions remain about the photos			0
" the door was removed quickly from the scene of the crime , but appears to have been reconstructed here , so it 's unclear when the photos were taken and whether this is a reconstruction			2
" these photos have also not been seen by @entity3 ' legal team , and their release to journalists will raise questions about whether police corruption may have been involved , " she said			2
the police investigation into the killing has been beset by problems and scandals since the start			0
@entity89 , the original lead investigator , admitted during @entity3 ' bail hearing that police had failed to wear protective shoe covers at the crime scene because they had run out of them , and that it was possible evidence had been damaged as a result			1
@entity89 also drew audible gasps from the packed courtroom when he testified that testosterone had been found at @entity3 ' house , before being forced to admit that he had n't actually read the full name of the substance			2
the sprinter 's lawyers testified that the substance was an herbal remedy			0
the paralympian 's lawyers also got @entity89 to acknowledge that investigators had failed to collect any evidence that counters @entity3 ' argument that he mistakenly shot @entity4			1
things took a turn for the surreal near the end of the bail hearing when it emerged that @entity89 himself had been charged with seven counts of attempted murder for firing on a minibus full of people in 2011			0
those charges had been withdrawn pending further investigation , but prosecutors reinstated them and he was pulled off the @entity3 case the day before the sprinter was granted bail			2
@entity66 says the timing of the release of the crime scene photos is especially significant , given that prosecutors are expected to ask magistrates next week to postpone the case pending further investigations			1
" a legal expert has told me all indications are that the state 's case against @entity3 is really quite thin at the moment , " @entity66 said			0
" it 's possible that the publication of these photos will delay the trial still further			0
" @entity146 spokesman @entity44 told @entity0 : " nothing will distract the detectives from the case			0
they will remain on course to make sure that they secure a murder conviction			0
" @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
