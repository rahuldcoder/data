with president @entity0 set to lay out his strategy to deal with @entity2 on wednesday , secretary of state @entity3 left for the @entity4 on an urgent new diplomatic drive with a single sales objective : shore up support from @entity8 to defeat what @entity3 calls @entity2 ' " genocidal agenda			1
" @entity3 has said the @entity11 will build " the broadest possible coalition of partners around the globe to confront , degrade and ultimately defeat @entity2			1
" " almost every single country has a role to play in eliminating the threat and the evil that ( @entity2 ) represents , " @entity3 said tuesday before leaving on the trip that will take him to @entity17 and @entity18			1
the @entity0 administration has already gathered about 10 countries as part of a global coalition to beat back @entity2			1
but the strength of the coalition could hinge on whether it includes members from the @entity4 , where @entity2 poses the biggest threat			1
@entity0 laid out @entity3 's marching orders during an interview last weekend with @entity33			2
" i think that it is absolutely true that we 're going to need @entity8 states to step up , not just @entity17 , our partners like @entity18 , the @entity38 , @entity39			1
they need to be involved			0
the dangers that are posed are -- are more directed at them right now than they are us , " @entity0 told @entity33 's " @entity47 " on sunday			2
" and that 's part of the conversation that @entity3 's going to be having this week " @entity11 want efforts to dismantle @entity2 to be undertaken by a coalition , according to a @entity55 / @entity54 poll released monday ; 60 % said @entity56 should undertake military action against @entity2 " only if other countries participate			1
" @entity3 's @entity4 strategy in order to get a buy - in from @entity62 states , @entity3 will take specific arguments to different countries			1
one key to his effort will be the new @entity68 government announced on monday , which @entity3 called a major milestone			2
@entity3 hopes the new government will attract @entity8 @entity62 help as it fights @entity2 and bolster @entity8 opposition to the group			1
the needs in any effort to defeat @entity2 are great : military support , including air power , arms , training , and intelligence			2
@entity11 officials say @entity62 partners will be asked to contribute what they can			0
the effort was given a boost on monday when the @entity62 league agreed to take urgent measures to combat @entity2 and other extremist groups , reflecting a new sense of urgency in the region			0
@entity0 looking for for congressional support on @entity2 @entity3 's coalition - building tour will first take him to @entity18 , which borders both @entity68 and @entity94 and is likely to play a major but discreet role in the coalition			1
@entity18 is already hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring @entity94			0
in @entity17 , @entity3 will hold talks in @entity99 with the foreign ministers of six @entity101 , @entity68 , @entity102 and @entity18			1
@entity3 must also convince the @entity101 allies to dry up funding to @entity2 , which comes from many of their own nationals and stop the flow of foreign fighters into @entity68 and @entity94 , considered the lifeblood of the group			2
another critical aspect to this will be driving a wedge between @entity8 and @entity2 , and delegitimizing the group 's ideology			2
@entity17 , in particular , is seen as having a critical role to play in convincing other @entity8 that @entity2 is the enemy			1
the kingdom has been very effective in beating back @entity119 in its territory , and officials and analysts say it has a unique religious credibility and legitimacy to combat @entity2 now			0
there are already efforts within @entity4 countries to root out extremists			0
last week , @entity17 arrested more than 80 extremists suspected of planning to carry out terrorist attacks both in the kingdom and abroad , and the @entity38 issued a statement last week saying it was ready to " join the international community in an urgent , coordinated and sustained effort to confront a threat that will , if unchecked , have global ramifications for decades to come			0
" the @entity38 statement also called for a " clear plan for direct intervention against @entity2			0
" support , but slim chance for military intervention but do n't look for countries in the @entity4 to join specifically with the @entity11 and @entity144 partners on a military campaign			1
officials have downplayed suggestions of @entity62 military involvement , although have privately suggested even some minor participation from countries such as the @entity38 and @entity17 would be important symbolic gestures about the need for @entity8 @entity62 states to take responsibility in fighting extremism within their own region			1
what is unclear is whether @entity3 , who visits the region the day after @entity0 delivers his speech laying out his strategy for combating @entity2 , will make specific requests this week for a military campaign to combat the group in either @entity68 or @entity94			1
@entity62 diplomats say without concrete details on what type of military campaign the @entity11 envisions , it will be hard for their leaders to sign up , no matter how badly they may want to			2
another question is what happens after the campaign against @entity2			0
@entity62 diplomats say similar extremist groups are operating in @entity175 , the @entity176 in @entity102 and @entity177 that pose a threat to the entire region and about which @entity56 and its @entity62 partners must have a conversation			0
with its laser focus on @entity2 , @entity62 diplomats complain the @entity11 is not connecting the dots about the alarming trends in the region			2
" without a tacit understanding of how we are going to work at extremism in general , it 's going to be tough to move ahead , " one @entity62 diplomat said			0
" you want us to join you in @entity68 and @entity94 and then when we see a problem in @entity175 or @entity177 or @entity102 and you say forget it ? i do n't think that is how it 's going to go			0
you ca n't be with us on one issue and be against us on another			0
" which is why @entity3 must carefully balance the concerns of a region nervous about a multitude of threats with the narrow @entity11 interests in combating @entity2			1
@entity11 officials say a series of airstrikes last week against armed @entity211 factions in @entity212 , @entity175 , were conducted by @entity102 and the @entity38			0
while neither country has acknowledged the action publicly , the move sent an important message to @entity56 that the region is ready to take measures into its own hands if the @entity11 does not take their concerns into account			0
the @entity11 saw competing @entity62 interests in aiding the @entity94 opposition contribute to the growth of extremists groups like @entity2			2
a similarly uncoordinated effort against the group could give birth to new , and potentially equally frightening , problems			0
@entity231 fears could help @entity232 in midterms senator apologizes for invoking names of slain journalists in policy argument			0

@entity3 is off to the @entity4 to shore up support in the fight against @entity2
the trip will take @entity3 to @entity17 and @entity18 just after @entity0 lays out strategy
by shoring up @entity8 support , the @entity11 looks to delegitimize @entity2 ' *caliphate* claims
@entity3 will look to win what support he can , but military involvement will be a tough sell
