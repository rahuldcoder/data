my girls , ages 6 and 8 , love sports , but we are not a family that watches much baseball or even follows the @entity8			1
of course , that was before we heard the name @entity11 , the 13 - year - old pitching phenom			0
now we check to see when she and her team , @entity16 's @entity15 , will play again ( wednesday night against @entity17 ) and celebrate her girl power achievements			1
she 's the first girl to throw a shutout in the @entity8 , the sixth to get a hit in @entity8 history and the first @entity23 to get front - page attention on one of the nation 's top sports magazines			1
" a girl on the cover of @entity34 for her prowess in a man 's sport , " cheered " @entity30 " host @entity28 in an e-mail			1
" @entity11 is wowing not just the sports world but all of us ! " we 're not just taken with how this 5 - foot - 4 inch eighth - grader throws 70 - mph fastballs and strikes out batter after batter			0
we 're also blown away by her grace under pressure and how she 's just being @entity47			0
" i never thought that i would be a role model at this age ... so i just have to be myself , " she said in a recent @entity49 interview			0
she 's an inspiration to any little girl who wants to play baseball some day -- and to all the women who know firsthand the doubters and naysayers that @entity57 has no doubt encountered on her path to @entity8 history			1
@entity60 , a @entity61 media strategist and fitness blogger at @entity63 , spent two years as the only girl on her @entity8 team and the only girl in her league when she was growing up in @entity68 , @entity69			1
" i was heckled by the dads : ' get that girl off the field , ' " she said they would scream			0
" i used to literally pray the ball would not come to me in right field as the pressure was so intense			0
" on her @entity81 page , along with a clip of a recent interview that @entity57 did , @entity77 gushed , " love her ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " " her impact is that she will not only inspire other girls to play but she is helping to remove the ' specialness ' of girls playing on that level , " she said			1
" over time people wo n't be amazed that a girl is so good			0
they will simply be amazed that a particular pitcher or catcher or fielder is so good			0
" that will no doubt take some time , but already @entity57 is sending a message to girls and boys , says @entity99 , a former president of the @entity100			1
the message to girls is pursue your dreams no matter what , said @entity99 , who has created a nonprofit called @entity107 focusing on inspiring women and girls			2
" go do what you think you want to do and do your best because you know there 's some mound waiting for you to make your best pitch on			0
" @entity57 ' success teaches boys and men about understanding and realizing that , " oh my goodness , there really are girls that can do that			1
" she also helps do away with those " gender - based biases we 're taught as kids about the boys ' role and the girls ' role , " she added			2
case in point : when i was recently at a party and my 10 - year - old nephew started to make a crack that someone " throws like a girl , " he stopped himself			0
sure , he knew his aunt frowned on such a negative comment , but then he thought about @entity57 and actually said her name			2
" throws like a girl " has a whole different meaning now , he realized			0
" it 's when a girl pitches a no - hitter ( or two ) or has a 70 - mph fastball ( and ) is no big deal that we know we have made progress because throwing like a girl is equivalent or better than throwing like a boy , " said @entity150 , a mom of a soon - to - be middle schooler in @entity152 , @entity153			2
@entity150 said she tries to instill in her daughter that being a girl is never an excuse for not trying something new			0
so will @entity57 open the floodgate of girls playing sports that boys traditionally play , wondered @entity28 , the television host and best - selling author ? " unlikely , but it will make it that much easier for the exceptional girl who wants to play with the boys , " she added			1
and the more athletes such as @entity57 who can command the attention of men , women , boys and girls alike , the more success for women 's sports , which still do n't get the respect , attention and tv contracts that male - dominated sports receive			1
elite women athletes " elevate their support economically , which is what has to happen for women 's professional sports to continue to grow , " said @entity99 , who is also a former women 's professional basketball player			0
@entity57 has already increased interest exponentially in the @entity8 , bringing much needed attention to the national pastime that has suffered , on the major league level , from performance - enhancing drug scandals , declining attendance and few superstar players			1
" @entity57 could actually be ( the ) antidote to the loss of young people interested in baseball			2
is n't there a beautiful irony here that there 's a young woman that 's attracting all this attention to baseball ? " @entity99 said			0
@entity57 , for her part , has her focus squarely on her next game at the @entity8 , and not on her future , but when asked her dreams , she has something specific in mind			1
and if you were hoping she 'd say becoming the first woman to take major league baseball by storm , you might be a tad disappointed			0
her goal is to be point guard for the @entity223 women 's basketball team and then play in the @entity100			1
if she can do on a basketball court what she 's proven she can do on the mound , we 'll no doubt be hearing @entity57 ' name for many years to come			2
what do you think @entity57 ' impact will be on girls and sports ? share your thoughts in the comments or tell @entity235 on @entity236 or @entity237 on @entity81 .			2

@entity57 is the first girl to throw a shutout in @entity8 history
she 's also the first @entity23 to appear on the cover of @entity34
@entity57 and her team play again wednesday night at the @entity8
parents say @entity57 is already inspiring girls and boys
