-- what 's that in the sky ? is it an asteroid ? a comet ? a lawn sprinkler ? turns out a newly discovered object is a little bit of all three -- minus the fact that you wo n't find many green lawns millions of miles from @entity14 -- @entity15 announced friday			1
" we were literally dumbfounded when we saw it , " @entity18 , who leads the team exploring the " asteroid with six comet - like tails of dust radiating from it like spokes on a wheel			1
" " it " is @entity27 , which @entity15 described as an " unusually fuzzy - looking object " when it was spotted in august in our solar system 's asteroid belt			1
the @entity31 then focused on it , photographing it first in early september and then again 13 days later			1
by then , it looked completely different -- as if it had done a 180 - degree flip , @entity15 said			0
" its tail structures change dramatically ... as it belches out dust , " @entity18 , a professor at the @entity35 at @entity36 , said in a news release			0
" that also caught us by surprise			0
it 's hard to believe we 're looking at an asteroid			1
" satellite falling to @entity14 the first - of - its - kind discovery " completely knocked out " astounded astronomers , he added			1
perhaps just as exciting is the expectation that this " amazing object ( is ) almost certainly the first of many to come			0
" as @entity18 said : " in astronomy , where you find one , you eventually find a whole bunch more			0
" the giant rock is about 1,400 feet wide and probably reaches surface temperatures of 1,500 degrees @entity59			0
for that reason , @entity15 thinks it 's made of rock and not ice , like a typical comet is			2
tens of billions of planets out there are like @entity14 the streams of dust were ejected six times between april and september -- something that the @entity15 team members believe might have been caused by the asteroid spinning so fast that its surface , at times , broke apart			2
@entity15 is still watching @entity27 -- which @entity18 says apparently is a fragment of a bigger asteroid that broke off approximately 200 million years ago -- to figure out exactly why it 's doing what it 's doing			2
one theory is that this is one way that asteroids die			1
the full findings were published on november 7 in the @entity83			0
big asteroid past @entity14 and will again in 19 years @entity0 's @entity85 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity31 focuses on object in the solar system 's asteroid belt
astronomers discover it is an " asteroid with six comet - like tails of dust radiating from it "
" we were literally dumbfounded when we saw it , " an astronomer says
one theory is that this is what happens to asteroids before they die
