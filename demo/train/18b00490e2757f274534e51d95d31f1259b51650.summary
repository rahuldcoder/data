@entity0 -- after @entity0 mayor @entity3 voted tuesday morning and a vocal contingent of volunteers moved on to another precinct , @entity3 's campaign manager headed downtown to write three news releases to issue based on the outcome of tuesday 's @entity11 primary election			1
@entity12 started with the hopeful news first and wrote the release his campaign would blast out if the mayor won the contest with a wide margin			2
but as voters across the district went to the polls tuesday morning , even @entity3 's closest confidants and advisers acknowledged that outcome was not likely			1
many cautioned that the election would be close , possibly within a few thousand votes			0
@entity28 then wrote two other news releases : one for if the race was too close to call but @entity3 was winning , and one for if it was too close to call and @entity30 , the upstart councilwoman who was @entity3 's most obvious challenger , was leading			1
@entity28 did n't write the news release for a loss			0
why ? " i am superstitious , " he said			0
as results slowly streamed in tuesday night , it became apparent that the " we lost " statement would be the one the @entity3 campaign would be forced to send			2
shortly after midnight wednesday morning , @entity3 conceded defeat to @entity30 in the district 's @entity11 primary			1
at that point , 127 out of 143 precincts had reported and @entity30 was running at 44 % of the vote , compared with @entity3 's 33 %			1
and shortly after @entity3 conceded , @entity30 accepted her party 's nomination in front of a raucous crowd			1
for @entity3 , no moment knocked the wheels off his campaign more than what many campaign insiders began calling " @entity56 monday " -- the day that @entity57 attorney @entity56 went to court and linked @entity3 to a 2010 shadow campaign run by businessman @entity59			1
prosecutors publicly claimed in march that @entity3 was aware of the illegal fundraising and had agreed with @entity59 to cover it up			0
even though @entity3 had not been charged and has vehemently denied any wrongdoing , the news elevated questions about honesty and ethics that had plagued @entity3 since his 2010 campaign and left many voters with doubt			1
@entity0 mayor says he wo n't resign over scandal march was full of bad news for @entity3			2
the @entity74 endorsed @entity30 that month , while polls showed the race tightening			0
the @entity59 news , which the @entity57 attorney has been inching toward for years , sent shock waves through the @entity11 primary			0
@entity3 's opponents seized on the @entity59 plea deal , and the ethical questions propelled @entity30 into a neck - and - neck race with the incumbent mayor down the stretch			1
the @entity59 plea deal " sucked a lot of the oxygen out of us , " close @entity3 campaign aide @entity87 said after the primary loss			2
some volunteers left @entity3 's campaign after the news , according to @entity87 , and some usually deep - pocketed supporters tightened up and stopped giving			1
" clearly the @entity59 plea and the manner in which it was reported was a shot to the gut , " he concluded			0
and then the public polls hit			0
while @entity3 was the frontrunner in early polls , a @entity74 poll shortly after the @entity59 news showed a surging @entity30 with 30 % of @entity11 support			1
@entity3 remained stagnant at 27 % , according to the poll			2
it was more than just external polling that had @entity3 's team a bit nervous			1
their internal polling also showed the same thing			0
poll : @entity0 mayor leads , helped by crowded field , in re-election bid according to @entity28 , the @entity3 campaign 's initial polling showed the mayor with 28 % support and @entity30 with 19 %			1
shortly before " @entity121 monday , " another internal poll showed that @entity3 's support had grown slightly to 34 % but that @entity30 's had grown more and was sitting at 28 %			1
but then news broke of @entity59 's plea deal and , according to @entity28 , the campaign " bled off everything that we had gained and we went back to our base			2
" while @entity28 contends that @entity3 has a solid base of support in the district of around 28 % to 30 % of @entity11 voters , he admitted that an internal poll after the announcement showed the race in a dead heat			2
" the good news is that stuff is coming back to us , " he said tuesday morning , based on voter contacts and knocking on doors			0
and that outward positivity might have been why @entity3 was so publicly confident monday night and tuesday morning			0
at a stop to rally the troops at campaign headquarters , the mayor munched on a burger , some fries and drank a soft drink			0
he talked with campaign supporters , slapped a few backs and thanked everyone for their work			0
in the morning -- admittedly not @entity3 's favorite time of day -- he talked about the campaign 's late momentum and the good feel he had about tuesday 's primary			1
he acknowledged that " @entity56 monday " set him back but said he thought the race should not be close			0
" given the record that we have , there should be no question about re-election for us , " @entity3 said with a bit of bravado			2
" this city is going in the right direction , and i am excited that people see that			0
" @entity3 is the latest @entity0 mayor to be dogged by scandal but by tuesday night , as polls closed across the district and results began to stream in , it appeared that @entity3 's confidence could n't overcome the numbers			1
by 11 p.m. , @entity30 had a sufficient lead on the mayor , and at @entity3 's campaign party at a local hotel ballroom , volunteers started to feel slightly concerned			1
" i ca n't do this , " said @entity183 , a vocal volunteer who chanted for @entity3 for most of tuesday			0
while she did n't say she was worried , @entity183 said she got a negative sense from the room			0
her senses were correct , because by that time , @entity3 and his closest advisers in a back room had begun to have doubts			2
as a cadre of close advisers watched results stream in , @entity87 said the mood was souring			0
by the time 20 % of the precincts were reporting and @entity30 's lead was not shrinking , @entity3 's political guru said it was apparent that the campaign " was n't doing as well " as it needed			1
" we were hopeful , but when it jumped up to 20 and people were staying where they were , we kind of knew , " @entity87 said .			0
