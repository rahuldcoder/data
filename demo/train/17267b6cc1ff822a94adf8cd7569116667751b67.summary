the @entity16 striker almost immediately won a penalty after being tripped and converted from the spot to draw his team level			0
it was his 44th goal for @entity3 , drawing him level with the great @entity21 , but more importantly sparked his spluttering team into action			1

the unlikely point came a day after the @entity51 stunned former @entity53 champion @entity54 1 - 0 in @entity55			2
@entity56 , population 40,000 , was also in fine form , upsetting @entity59 1 - 0 in @entity60 its captain @entity61 scored the goal , for a first competitive win since june 2011			2
but there was no such luck for 2018 @entity67 hosts @entity68 , beaten 1 - 0 in @entity69 in the same group , a result which leaves coach @entity73 's future under the spotlight			2
@entity75 scored the decisive goal in the 73rd minute as @entity69 opened up a five - point lead at the top of the group standings			0
