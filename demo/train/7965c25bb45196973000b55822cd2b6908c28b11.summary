-- as the global community commemorates @entity3 on wednesday , international health organizations report both promising and sobering trends			0
while the @entity14 says new hiv infections have declined by almost 20 percent worldwide over the past decade , the estimated number of children living with @entity10 or @entity11 in 11 @entity13 countries has increased by 46 percent between 2001 and 2009 , the @entity7 's @entity6 office said wednesday			1
" in 2001 , an estimated 89,000 children were living with hiv / aids , " said @entity16 , public information and advocacy officer for @entity7 's regional office in @entity20 , @entity21			1
" in 2009 , there are an estimated 130,000 children living with @entity10 infection , " including recent hiv infection , advanced hiv infection and @entity11			1
the 11 countries in the region are @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity21 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			2
but a report by a @entity14 program released last month shows some encouraging news , including drops in @entity11 - related deaths and new @entity10 cases			0
data from the 2010 global report by the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) shows that an estimated 2.6 million people became newly infected with @entity10 , compared with the estimated 3.1 million people infected in 1999			0
also in 2009 , approximately 1.8 million people died from @entity11 - related illnesses , compared with the roughly 2.1 million in 2004 , according to @entity49			0
among young people in 15 of the most severely affected countries , the rate of new hiv infections has fallen by more than 25 percent , led by young people adopting safer sexual practices , according to @entity49			1
" we are breaking the trajectory of the @entity11 epidemic with bold actions and smart choices , " said @entity60 , executive director of @entity49			0
" investments in the @entity11 response are paying off , but gains are fragile -- the challenge now is how we can all work to accelerate progress			0
" but not all the news from the @entity49 report , which covered 182 countries , was good			0
" even though the number of new hiv infections is decreasing , there are two new hiv infections for every one person starting @entity10 treatment , " @entity49 said			1
@entity79 continues to be the region most affected by the epidemic , with 69 percent of all new hiv infections , according to @entity49			1
in seven countries , mostly in eastern @entity84 and central @entity6 , new hiv infection rates have increased by 25 percent			2
@entity49 said in the @entity85 , 90 percent of countries have laws that obstruct the rights of people living with @entity10			2
despite the lower numbers of new hiv infections and @entity11 - related deaths , @entity49 said the demand for resources is surpassing the supply			1
" donor governments ' disbursements for the @entity11 response in 2009 stood at $ 7.6 billion , lower than the $ 7.7 billion available in 2008 , " @entity49 said			0
" declines in international investments will affect low - income countries the most -- nearly 90 percent rely on international funding for their aids programs			2

the estimated number of children with hiv / aids in 11 @entity13 countries increases 46 percent
the @entity14 says the number of new hiv infections has dropped 20 percent in the past decade
but the number of new hiv infections *outpaces* the number of people starting treatment
