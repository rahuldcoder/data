@entity0 -- @entity2 is stepping down this week as the @entity4 's general secretary -- the primus inter pares in the party politburo , @entity9 's elite decision - making body			1
in march next year , he is also expected to hand over his post as @entity9 's state president to his presumptive successor , @entity12			1
but is the 69 - year - old @entity2 retiring completely ? will he give up all his posts , including chairmanship of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , an influential post that oversees major national security and military affairs ? " we do n't know if he will step down yet , " said @entity19 , professor at @entity20			1
" the party congress is still in the bargaining process			0
for @entity12 , he needs time to consolidate his power no matter if @entity2 will retire or not			1
" the months leading up to the ongoing 18th party congress , which is held once every five years , have brought contentious back - room horse - trading among the party elite , including party chief @entity2 and retired leaders like former president @entity32 , @entity9 analysts say			1
speculation is rife as to why @entity2 would give up the @entity15 chair			2
@entity35 , a professor at @entity36 in @entity37 , sees two possible reasons			0
" one is that the different forces within the party are intensely locked in negotiations over top appointments and @entity2 steps down in exchange for some personnel or policy arrangements that @entity2 wants			2
another is possibly a new consensus that the institutional handover of leadership will be straightforward ... this could be either initiated by @entity2 or by a collective decision			1
" women breaking @entity9 's glass ceiling ? the factional bargaining will culminate on wednesday , when the party congress closes with the election of a new @entity59 , a top body of more than 200 party leaders and cadres			1
the next day , the committee will meet to name a new politburo and its new standing committee -- @entity9 's elite ruling council			2
it will also choose the new members of the @entity70 , an internal anti-corruption body , and the @entity15 ( @entity15 )			0
in theory , the congress delegates and the @entity59 members have some influence over -- and formally vote on -- leadership decisions			2
however , the lineup is largely decided among the most powerful party leaders and elders			0
why is @entity15 chairmanship important ? it is the highest decision - making body in military affairs and is usually chaired by the @entity4 chief			2
its members include the defense minister and top military commanders			0
the chair of the @entity15 is one of the most powerful leaders in @entity9 politics , along with the @entity4 chief and state president			2
@entity2 warns party of ' enemy within ' in the recent past , all three posts have been held by one person			2
but @entity2 will not be an exception if he decides to cling on to the @entity15 post after retirement			0
@entity101 kept his @entity15 chair and used it to exercise considerable power and influence even after he retired			0
@entity101 's successor @entity32 also retained his @entity15 chair after he handed over top posts to @entity2 in 2002			1
however , @entity35 gave it up to @entity2 in 2004 , apparently due to pressure from party stalwarts and military leaders			0
only then was @entity2 able to solidify his position as paramount leader			0
like @entity101 and @entity35 , analysts say , @entity2 would want to avoid getting relegated into a lame duck position after retirement			0
at stake for @entity2 is the chance to perpetuate his influence in the leading party bodies and policy - making institutions			1
it will be a sign of @entity2 's continued political clout if he stays , but analysts say @entity2 can also ensure that by proxy			0
" even if he retires , he will not retire completely , " said @entity19			0
" he wants to maintain continuity of his influence in the party and in the military			0
" how @entity9 's party congress works @entity19 noted that @entity127 , a regional commander of the @entity129 , and @entity130 , commander of the @entity131 -- both recently appointed to the @entity15 -- are close to @entity2			1
@entity2 has marshaled much of his political capital to promote his top @entity133 © , @entity134 , already in the party 's inner circle and executive vice premier , as potential successor			2
whether @entity2 can install @entity134 ahead of @entity12 , who is regarded as @entity32 's choice , is deemed a measure of @entity2 's strength			1
@entity134 is expected to move to the top , but not as @entity2 's successor as paramount leader			1
@entity12 , 59 , was elected last week as the ad hoc secretary general of the congress proceedings , another signal that he is firmly lined up to inherit @entity2 's top posts			1
the only question that remains , experts say , is when @entity12 will take up the @entity15 chairmanship			1
" @entity12 's position will be enhanced if @entity2 steps down now , " said @entity35			1
" he can assume full institutional power			0
of course , that will not change the basic dynamics that @entity12 is a team leader in a collective decision - making system			1
he will have to build consensus for any major policy initiatives			0
" such a consensus will be even more important if @entity12 intends to pursue significant political reform measures .			0

@entity2 preparing to hand over power to presumptive successor , @entity12
but experts question whether he will really retire , or maintain some *vestiges* of office
@entity9 politicians caught up in complex factional horse - trading
final decision on makeup of new @entity59 expected this week
