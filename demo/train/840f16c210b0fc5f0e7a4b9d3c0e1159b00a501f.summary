-- defiant authorities in @entity2 say they wo n't bow to @entity4 pressure as they weigh former @entity8 contractor @entity6 's request for asylum			1
@entity2 's president and other top officials said thursday that they 're turning down the trade benefits the @entity4 gives them as part of the @entity15			1
" in the face of threats , insolence and arrogance of certain @entity4 sectors , which have pressured to remove the preferential tariffs because of the @entity6 case , @entity2 tells the world we unilaterally and irrevocably renounce the preferential tariffs , " president @entity16 said thursday , reiterating comments other officials from his government made earlier in the day			1
in a fiery speech at an event in @entity32 , @entity2 , the president vowed not to back down			0
" it is outrageous to try to delegitimize a state for receiving a petition of asylum , " @entity16 said			1
authorities in @entity2 said they 're still evaluating @entity6 's asylum petition , which has thrust the @entity40 country into the international spotlight as a key player in the global manhunt for the fugitive who has admitted leaking classified documents about @entity4 surveillance programs			1
@entity6 , who faces espionage charges in the @entity4 , is slammed as a traitor by critics and hailed as a hero by his supporters			2
where can you buy a second citizenship ? for @entity16 , a left - leaning economist who is known for decrying what he and other @entity58 leaders have called @entity4 imperialism , the leaker 's case has provided a platform both to espouse his views and to slam his critics			2
he offered a swift response on social media when a @entity67 editorial this week criticized what the newspaper called a " double standard " in @entity2 , noting that the country is weighing asylum for @entity6 just after it passed new regulations cracking down on press freedoms			1
" what a joke ! do they realize the power of the international press ? they have centered the attention on @entity6 and the ' evil ' countries that ' support ' him , making everyone forget the terrible things that he denounced in front of the @entity40 people and the entire world , " @entity16 said in a series of @entity84 posts			2
but even as government officials ratchet up their rhetoric , some in @entity2 have expressed concerns about the effect souring relations with the @entity4 could have on the country			1
@entity2 - @entity4 relations in the spotlight the head of @entity2 's chamber of commerce on thursday criticized the government 's decision to withdraw from the trade deal as a " hostile act " that was " irresponsible			1
" former vice president @entity105 , a sharp critic of @entity16 's government , said it was a decision that would have a " gravely negative " impact on his country			2
" it creates an unsuitable climate for a profitable , productive and positive relationship , which is what @entity2 and the @entity4 should have , " he said			2
trade between the @entity4 and @entity2 totaled more than $ 16 billion last year , according to figures from the @entity116			2
about half of @entity2 's foreign trade depends on the @entity4			1
analysts say the @entity15 , which has allowed @entity2 to import and export goods with reduced tariffs , has fueled growth in trade and commerce between the two nations			0
on thursday , a @entity127 spokesman warned that @entity2 's economic ties with the @entity4 could be in jeopardy if the @entity40 country offers asylum to @entity6			1
" what would not be a good thing is them granting mr. @entity6 asylum , " @entity127 spokesman @entity132 told reporters			0
" that would have grave difficulties for a bilateral relationship			0
" he added that withdrawing from trade agreements is n't exactly an option for @entity2			0
" they 're unilateral trade provisions that provide a benefit to certain @entity2 products , " @entity132 said			0
" whether they 're renewed or not is a prerogative of the @entity150			0
" @entity2 offers $ 23 million to the @entity4 the agreement is set to expire next month			2
many believed it would n't be renewed , said @entity154 , dean of economics at the @entity156 in @entity157			0
that could make @entity16 's announcement thursday a wise political move that will bolster his support at home , but cost the country relatively little , @entity154 said			0
" he is giving up something that we did not have , because it was evident that the @entity15 was not going to be renewed , " @entity154 said			0
" it 's like if i withdraw from winning the lottery when i have n't bought a ticket , and i announce that i wo n't accept first prize			2
" @entity170 , an @entity2 sociologist , warned that @entity2 's role in the @entity6 case could have a chilling effect on investors			1
" @entity2 is searching for investors , and this image of going more and more to a radical position on the left does not generate tranquility , " he said			0
but the @entity6 case and @entity2 's decision last year to grant asylum to @entity184 founder @entity183 have helped @entity16 promote his image as a leftist leader in the region , @entity170 said			1
" they help him gain credibility on the leftist scene , " @entity170 said			0
on thursday , @entity2 officials offered to give $ 23 million annually -- roughly the same amount officials said that @entity2 receives in benefits from the tariff deal -- to the @entity4			1
the money , communications secretary @entity195 told reporters thursday morning , could be used for human rights training			0
by thursday evening , @entity16 did n't show any sign of changing his government 's tune , vowing to make the decision regarding @entity6 's asylum request with absolute sovereignty and without regard to any trade deals or other international pressures			1
