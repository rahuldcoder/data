@entity0 -- after a campaign season marked mainly by @entity4 fleeing his shadow , president @entity2 embarked upon the final push of what he calls his last campaign sunday , hoping to mobilize voters in the few pockets of the country where he remains somewhat popular			1
@entity2 headlined afternoon campaign rallies for @entity4 gubernatorial candidates in @entity14 and @entity15 , capping off a cycle that saw him rally for only one @entity18 candidate and a handful of governors			1
his diminished presence in 2014 amounted mostly to headlining high - dollar fundraisers in wealthy neighborhoods , mostly on the coasts , where he sought to motivate donors amid bleak prospects for his party in tuesday 's midterm elections			2
in tight races across the country , @entity4 have distanced themselves from his policies , declaring themselves independent from the @entity32 as @entity33 worked overtime to lump them into the same unpopular mold			0
the president himself has fueled that effort at times , saying during an economic address in october that his " policies are on the ballot " and telling @entity42 during a radio interview that vulnerable democrats are " all folks that vote with me			0
" @entity2 , whose presidential campaign drew massive crowds of young people and african - americans in 2008 and 2012 , has been working to propel those voters to the polls			1
@entity4 have little chance of keeping control of the @entity18 unless traditional @entity4 voting blocs turn out in force			0
that was @entity2 's goal sunday in @entity0 , where he revved up a majority black crowd at a rally for @entity4 gubernatorial candidate @entity62			1
" we 've got some work to do			0
because two days from now , you get to choose your future , " he said , reminding the 5,500 attendees that the historic battle for the right to vote must be honored by casting ballots in midterm elections			0
@entity2 reiterated that theme in @entity14 earlier sunday at a rally for gov. @entity74			1
" your vote matters , " he told the 1,900 supporters who came to see him speak in @entity76			0
" do n't let people tell you it does n't			0
" the crowd in @entity14 was largely enthusiastic about hearing from the president , but his speech was interrupted multiple times by protesters for immigration reform who carried signs with messages such as " dreamers demand bold , broad , inclusive relief			1
" each time protesters interrupted @entity2 , they were shouted down by the crowd			1
on at least one occasion , members of the crowd ripped the signs away from a group of protesters , who were ultimately escorted out by security			0
the campaign effort over the weekend amounted to @entity2 's biggest push for @entity4 this cycle			1
his reduced role is the outcome of record low approval ratings and policies unpopular in many parts of the country			1
the restricted campaign role is n't necessarily where @entity2 wanted to be during the final congressional contests of his presidency , though past second - term presidents have similarly dragged down their party 's candidates			1
" i 'm not on the ballot this time , and this is the last election cycle in which i 'm involved as president , " he said in @entity118 on thursday			2
" it makes you a little wistful , because i do like campaigning			0
" he was originally scheduled to campaign in @entity14 last month , but canceled shortly beforehand for meetings on his administration 's @entity128 response			1
the president 's rescheduled appearance comes at a potentially critical point for @entity133			2
the one - term governor is polling neck - and - neck in his re-election battle against @entity33 nominee @entity137 , a former @entity138 ambassador to @entity139 who lost to @entity133 by only 6,400 votes in 2010			0
a @entity142 poll released wednesday had the two men at 43 % each among likely voters			0
a third candidate , @entity145 , is polling third with 7 % in the same survey , with 6 % undecided			0
despite these poll numbers , @entity149 spokesman @entity148 said sunday he believes a heavy emphasis on voter turnout will bring @entity133 a win on tuesday			0
" i think with president @entity2 coming here today , we 're going to see a lot of interest from base @entity4 voters , " @entity154 told @entity1			1
" if they come out to vote , turn out in full force , gov. @entity133 's confident he 's going to win this campaign			2
" @entity14 is a reliably blue state , but not totally averse to @entity33 governors -- @entity133 himself succeeded two republicans when he took office			2
in @entity15 , @entity62 has led the @entity33 incumbent @entity167 for most of the race , and while polls have narrowed recently , he still maintains an edge .			2
