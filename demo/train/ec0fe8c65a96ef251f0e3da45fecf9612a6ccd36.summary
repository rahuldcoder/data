@entity0 -- @entity0 has been a city of splendor for more than three centuries , and bears the name of the man who dreamt it all up : tsar @entity7			1
but since @entity9 took power in 2000 , this city has been best known as the hometown of the president , and those in his inner circle who call the shots within the @entity17 and in business			1
@entity19 , bureau chief for the financial daily @entity20 , said the power structure of " @entity23 , " is woven through with the city 's elite			0
" there are a lot of @entity0 - born people in the @entity30 cabinet , " she said			1
" also the @entity31 of the @entity30 big monopolies like @entity33 , like @entity34 , like @entity35			2
" in a symbol of the city 's rising prominence , the state - run energy giant @entity33 will move its headquarters here next year at a cost of nearly $ 2 billion			2
the @entity41 , or @entity42 , is @entity9 's version of @entity44			1
it is a showcase event for his administration and a chance for @entity31 of the @entity48 100 to rub shoulders with those who matter most in this near $ 2 trillion economy			0
but it is obvious , with a long , long list of no shows from corporate america and @entity58 , the tone has changed dramatically for the worse at @entity42			0
according to @entity19 , " it could painful for the president 's self esteem			1
" a year ago , the forum kicked off what was designed to be a smooth agenda of orchestrated events			0
@entity67 chancellor @entity66 shared the stage with the president in a panel that i chaired			0
tensions between them were obvious , but so too were overriding bilateral trade interests			0
a few months later , @entity9 talked of re-igniting growth as he hosted the @entity76 in @entity0			1
in december , he moved to rescue @entity77 with a $ 15 billion bailout for his old ally , the now ousted @entity80 president @entity79			2
shortly thereafter , he was hosting the high - priced @entity81			0
but it is @entity9 's annexation of @entity84 and unrest in @entity77 which will define 2014 and very likely his legacy			1
@entity9 's popularity has skyrocketed at home , but that is weighed against economic isolation abroad			1
during the height of the @entity93 - led banking crisis , @entity9 chided co-members of the @entity95 for their careless ways and lack of corporate governance			2
today , the economic tide of growth has moved out on @entity30			0
and that , according to @entity101 , former @entity102 and @entity9 biographer , will force the @entity17 to take measured steps going forward			0
" if a military conflict were to spread into @entity77 , against the background of further economic and trade sanctions , then i think @entity9 might lose support , " @entity101 said			2
" that 's why i think @entity30 is very wary of full military intervention in eastern and southern @entity77 at the moment			1
" in the spring of 2013 , the @entity30 president promised protestors he would raise their standards of living by fostering investment			1
having most @entity118 and many @entity58 corporate leaders staying away from his annual gathering on the @entity121 will not assist in the effort			0
and the event that was scheduled to round off the president 's calendar on the global stage -- the @entity127 , due to be held during @entity0 's long white nights -- has been canceled			1
instead , there will only be the @entity130 in @entity131			0
