-- you feel worse by the hour			0
your joints ache ; your head feels heavy ; you ca n't stop coughing			2
you 're freezing , even as your temperature keeps climbing , and your stomach is upset			2
face it : you have the flu			2
now what do you do ? most flu patients should not go to an emergency room , said dr. @entity13 , internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at @entity16 in @entity17			1
