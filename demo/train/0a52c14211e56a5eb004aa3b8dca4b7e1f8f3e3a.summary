goals from @entity11 and a @entity13 own goal handed @entity1 the advantage in the race for the @entity16			0

or so you would think			0
as fans invaded the pitch in @entity43 , where @entity9 are currently playing their matches , some held banners aloft proclaiming the triumph to be @entity16 number 30			0
that 's because in 2006 the club was stripped of the two titles they won under former @entity53 coach @entity52 following a match fixing scandal that engulfed the club and saw them relegated to @entity57 it was a humiliating experience for one of world football 's greatest clubs , but this season has seen something close to redemption , as the club has gone 37 games unbeaten under the reign of former @entity5 international @entity67			1
it is his first season in charge			0
the team celebrated wildly with the fans in @entity43 , while the @entity25 wondered what might have been in the @entity23			0
a highly dubious first half penalty converted by @entity77 international @entity76 had canceled out @entity33 's opener			2
@entity76 , a former @entity1 player who has never been forgiven by the fans for leaving the club so soon after their relegation to @entity57 , then gave @entity25 hope scoring his second 30 seconds after the start of the second half			2
