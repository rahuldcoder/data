thanks to the resilience of @entity3 workers and businesses of all sizes , " @entity6 " is making a comeback			1
according to data released last week by the @entity10 , @entity3 businesses exported $ 2.35 trillion in goods and services in 2014 , hitting a record high for the fifth straight year			1
the @entity3 sold more to our 20 free trade partners than ever before and logged record exports to more than 50 overseas markets			1
this is good news all around -- for our economy , workers and wages			0
after all , @entity3 exports have been one of the primary drivers of @entity3 's economic resurgence , contributing one - third of our economic growth since 2009 and supporting 11.3 million jobs in 2013			1
with those jobs paying up to 18 % more , on average , than jobs not related to exports , trade promotion has an important role to play in boosting the incomes of middle class @entity3			1
yet @entity3 's recovery remains incomplete , and unfair foreign practices are threatening our progress			1
today , many of our workers are competing against counterparts in countries that lack basic labor rights			0
meanwhile , some foreign governments are further skewing the playing field by providing subsidies and encouraging competition without concern for the environment			0
at stake is not merely @entity3 's status as a place that makes real things , but more fundamentally , the strength of our middle class and the sanctity of our values			1
when worker rights are n't respected abroad , the human toll is measured both in @entity3 jobs and in a deficit of dignity for workers around the world			1
likewise , the absence of environmental protections beyond our borders puts workers and businesses at a competitive disadvantage here at home while jeopardizing the health of our waters , wildlife , air and other treasures that span national boundaries			0
in the face of these challenges , trade agreements are among our best tools for defending @entity3 interests and values			1
just look at the @entity83 , an agreement that the @entity3 is negotiating with 11 other countries in the @entity86 and which includes nearly 40 % of the global economy			2
if agreement can be reached , the deal would grow @entity3 exports by more than $ 120 billion a year , one study estimates , and support more well - paying jobs			1
most importantly , the @entity83 will allow the @entity3 to level the playing field for our workers and businesses in the world 's fastest - growing region			1
at present , @entity3 autoworkers are handicapped by tariffs that can reach 30 % in rapidly growing markets such as @entity101			2
for their part , @entity3 farmers are forced to contend with tariffs as high as 40 % on poultry in @entity106			2
in these industries and others , @entity83 will eliminate or significantly reduce barriers to @entity3 exports			2
additionally , @entity83 will contain the toughest environmental and labor protections of any trade agreement in history , including the first provisions to combat the trade in illegal wildlife and the products of illegal fishing , among other advances			0
the benefits of @entity83 are clear , while the alternative to leading on trade is alarming			0
in recent years , countries in the @entity86 have struck over 200 trade agreements , while @entity3 companies and workers have largely missed out			2
@entity127 has been extremely active , and we can not afford to sit on the sidelines			0
while passing @entity83 will start a race to the top , ceding leadership to others could result in a race to the bottom			0
not leading on trade would undercut our capacity to safeguard labor rights , environmental protections , a free and open @entity140 , a level playing field between state - owned companies and our private businesses , and a host of provisions which unite @entity3 's interests and values			1
getting this done will require unity of effort			0
in calling for bipartisan @entity152 , president @entity151 has invited @entity153 to assert its role on trade and provide guidance to the executive branch , including on issues that have emerged since that authority was last updated in 2002 , such as the role of state - owned companies and the digital economy			0
as the president said during his @entity165 address , 95 % of the world 's customers live outside the @entity3			2
no savvy entrepreneur would leave that much of the market untapped			0
passing a bipartisan trade promotion bill is an important step toward opening those markets , unlocking opportunity for all @entity3 and advancing the first trade agenda that 's as progressive as it is pro-growth .			0
