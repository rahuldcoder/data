-- on thursday , defense secretary @entity1 announced the @entity2 would lift the ban on women serving in combat , marking another significant milestone for equality in our nation			1
taking this critical step forward to include women in combat strengthens our military by reducing the burden of the disproportionate number of soldiers who are making sacrifices			1
i sincerely hope that this will spark a national debate about who is fighting our wars and whether all of @entity23 can say that we 're sharing the sacrifice			1
since january 2003 , at the height of the debate on the possible unilateral strike against @entity28 , i have advocated for a reinstatement of the military draft to ensure a more equitable representation of people making sacrifices in wars in which the @entity23 is engaged			1
in the past decade , more than 2 million soldiers have served in @entity28 and @entity36			0
the @entity28 war took more than 4,422 lives and wounded some 32,000 in nine years ; to date , 2,168 @entity23 soldiers have died and 18,215 have been wounded in @entity36			2
opinion : women in combat a dangerous experiment currently the burden of defending our nation is carried by less than 1 % of the @entity23 population			1
the 2.2 million members of the armed forces in active duty , the @entity47 and the @entity48 have become a virtual military class that makes the ultimate sacrifice of laying down life and limb for our country			0
as a result of high combat exposure , combined with multiple deployments , we have seen unprecedented incidences of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder , traumatic brain injury and veterans committing suicide			0
since we replaced the compulsory military draft with an all - volunteer force in 1973 , our nation has been making decisions about wars without worry over who fights them			1
i sincerely believe that reinstating the draft would compel the @entity23 public to have a stake in the wars we fight as a nation			2
that is why i wrote the @entity81 , known as the " draft " bill , which requires all men and women between ages 18 and 25 to give two years of service in any capacity that promotes our national defense			2
opinion : will infantry men accept women as peers ? i commend president @entity95 for allowing women and members of the @entity99 community to serve our country			2
i was pleased to hear in the inaugural speech on monday of his commitment to ending a decade of war and to using diplomacy as a means to promote peace in the world			0
inevitably , however , as in the past , there will be times in the future when @entity23 will be faced with the question of whether we need to place thousands of our young men and women in harm 's way			0
when that time comes , i hope all of @entity23 will be forced to stop and think twice about it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of rep. @entity123			0

@entity123 : allowing women in combat is a critical advance that *bolsters* military
he says for real equality , the @entity23 should reinstate the draft for shared sacrifice in @entity23 wars
he says less than 1 % are in @entity23 service . we choose war without worry over who fights
@entity123 : with draft , @entity23 would be forced to think twice about *involvement* in wars
