-- several hundred of @entity3 's closest friends and family crowded into a @entity6 , @entity7 , church wednesday afternoon to say goodbye to the queen of disco , who died of lung cancer last week			1
the family had kept the funeral plans private , but by wednesday afternoon it was revealed that the service was being held at @entity15 in @entity6			0
cameras were not allowed inside			0
@entity17 performed " @entity22 " with @entity18 , according to @entity19 , @entity21 's record label			1
@entity3 's sisters , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , sang " we 've come this @entity28			1
" guests included @entity30 , who produced several of @entity3 's hits , and singer @entity32			1
@entity3 had been a @entity6 resident since 1995			1
@entity3 's death at age 63 last thursday began a flow of tributes for the five - time @entity38 winner , whose music was a driving beat of the disco era in the last half of the 1970s			1
" her talent was a true gift to the music industry , " said @entity43 , president and ceo of the @entity45			0
" few singers have impacted music & the world like @entity3 ! it 's the end of an era , " singer @entity52 wrote on @entity53			1
" i ca n't believe we 've lost another wonderful singer , " @entity56 said			0
" @entity3 , like @entity59 ( @entity60 ) , had one of the greatest voices ever			2
she was the disco queen , and will remain so			0
i knew her and found her to be one of the most likable and fun people ever			0
she will be missed and remembered			0
" summer , born in @entity66 to a father who was a butcher and a mother who was a schoolteacher , sang from the moment she learned to talk			0
her debut performance came in church at age 10 when the scheduled singer did n't show and the pastor asked @entity3 to step in			1
@entity3 later recalled that the church performance left worshipers in tears			2
though she is iconic in the disco genre , her five @entity38 wins were also in the r&b , rock , inspirational and dance categories			1
@entity3 : a diva who defined the disco moment in a 2003 interview with @entity0 , she said the initial absence of a manager led her to do provocative photo shoots			1
her public image as a sex symbol and diva conflicted with her religious upbringing , she said			0
her grandfather was a minister and her father a church deacon			0
" yes , it was a big complex and the image was sort of created around me , " @entity3 said			2
" i was sort of there , but not consciously there			0
and i did n't have anybody sort of on my side at that point , fighting for me , except for me , being in the middle			0
and then people would say , you know , ' @entity106 down here and do this			0
' and you know , whatever , " @entity3 said			2
summer first rose to fame the mid- ' 70s , thanks to " @entity113			1
" with @entity3 's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans , the song helped define the mid- ' 70s disco trend and hit no. 2 in 1976			1
summer followed the song with such hits as " @entity122 , " " @entity123 " and a disco - fied version of the @entity125 hit " @entity126 , " which outdid @entity125 ' version by hitting no. 1 on @entity129 's hot 100 singles chart			0
it was @entity3 's first of four chart - toppers			2
but with her 1979 album , " @entity135 , " @entity3 broke out of the disco mold as the genre , which had become renewed by the success of the " @entity140 " soundtrack , was feeling a backlash			1
" @entity135 " demonstrated @entity3 's vocal and stylistic range and produced two no. 1 hits , " @entity144 " and " @entity135 , " as well as a @entity146 ballad , " @entity147			2
" however , @entity3 had some trouble adjusting to the changing times			2
her next album , " @entity151 , " went for more of a rock feel			0
it produced a top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially after the success of " bad girls , " a double album that spent five weeks at no. 1			0
it was n't until 1983 's " @entity162 , " which became a ubiquitous video as well as a big radio hit , that @entity3 's fame approached its late ' 70s zenith			1
dim all the lights , this ' last dance ' goes out to @entity3 @entity0 's @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			1
