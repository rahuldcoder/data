-- the @entity1 is not as bad you think they are			2
at least , that 's what a list of " myths and facts " issued thursday by the @entity1 about pat - downs and other security measures would like you to consider			1
many @entity10 have reacted with displeasure , or even outrage , over recent high - profile stories about intrusive searches at airports			2
in one of the instances that reverberated the strongest , a @entity18 man 's video of his encounter with @entity1 agents went viral			2
@entity23 refused an x-ray scan and then famously told agents that , " if you touch my junk , i 'll have you arrested			1
" in its fact sheet , the @entity1 says that pat - downs only occur when a passenger sets off a metal detector or opts out of an x-ray scan			1
the latter is what led to @entity23 's confrontation with the @entity1			2
some see the pat - downs as a punishment for refusing to get scanned , but the @entity1 says that is not the case			1
" there is nothing punitive about it -- it just makes good security sense , " the @entity1 said			2
" and the weapons and other dangerous and prohibited items we 've found during pat - downs speak to this			1
" there are 400 full - body scanning machines at 69 airports nationwide , according to the @entity1			1
about 24 million air travelers are expected to fly over the @entity55 holiday period , according to the @entity56 , an airline trade group			0
grass - roots groups are urging travelers either not to fly or to protest by opting out of the full - body scanners and undergoing time - consuming pat - downs instead			1
industry leaders are worried about the backlash			0
homeland security secretary @entity63 met with leaders of travel industry groups to discuss the concerns			0
another myth that the @entity1 tackled is that all children will receive pat - downs			1
children who require extra screening who are under 12 receive a modified pat - down , the @entity1 said			1
that news probably is n't reassuring for teenagers who draw a secondary security screening			0
capt. @entity76 , the hero pilot , has gone on record as a critic of the @entity1 measures			0
he said the use of full - body pat - downs and advanced imaging scanners for airline personnel " just is n't an efficient use of our resources			1
" then there is the issue of whether the full - body scans , done in advance imaging technology , or ait machines , are safe			0
it is a myth that they are not safe , the @entity1 says			0
the backscatter technology used in the machines has been evaluated by the @entity95 and the @entity96 , the @entity1 says			0
" in fact , a traveler is exposed to less radiation from one @entity102 scan than from two minutes of an airline flight , " the fact sheet says			0
passengers have also expressed concerns that the images from the scanners can be saved or transmitted to other devices			0
the @entity1 also calls this a myth , saying that the scanning machines do not have the capability to save or transmit images , and that other devices , such as cell phones with cameras , are not allowed in the screening rooms .			0

@entity1 says that pat - downs are only for those who set off metal detectors
they are also for those who opt out of an x-ray scan
passengers have expressed displeasure with the pat - downs at airports
