@entity0 was only 15 years old when the horror began			1
while most young girls worry about boys and homework , @entity0 spent her teenage days fearing she would not live to see the sun rise again			1
she spent a lifetime trying forget the horrors she had to endure at @entity9			1
this year she is turning 91 and for the first time she shares her story and tries to make sense of why she survived when so many others did not			2
@entity0 was living with her family in @entity15 when @entity17 's troops marched into @entity18 in the fall of 1939			1
" @entity15 was such a beautiful city before the @entity20 came			2
one of the most beautiful places i have ever known " , she remembers			2
over seven decades later , @entity0 's memory is beginning to fade and she struggles to remember when exactly she was brought to @entity9 , but she can not forget the day she arrived at the death camp			1
" there were thousands of us , squeezed into wagons			2
@entity9 was very close to @entity15 , but they drove us around for hours , so we would n't know where we were ' " she says			1
" i remember it was dark , but it looked like the sky was on fire			2
it was the gas chambers , they made it look like the sky was burning , " @entity0 remembers			1
the newly arrived prisoners had to take their clothes off and lie naked on the ground			1
then the selection process started			2
pregnant women , children , elderly people and anyone who was deemed unfit for intense physical labor were sent directly to the gas chambers			2
" they told us to go left or right			2
one direction meant life , the other one meant death			1
i never knew which one i was going , " the 90 - year old says			1
suddenly a colleague of her brother 's was standing in front her			0
he was working at the camp			2
" he recognized me and brought me some food			2
all of a sudden i realized i was naked			0
i was so ashamed i dropped the food			0
later , he asked one of the @entity65 officers to give me a pair of underwear			0
you can not imagine how cold it was			0
we were happy for every piece of clothing we were given			0
" the prisoners at @entity9 were forced into excruciating physical labor , beaten , tortured and subjected to horrific medical experiments spearheaded by the ss captain dr. @entity76			1
many of those who were not sent to the gas chambers died of starvation and illness			0
an estimated 1.3 million people were deported to the concentration camp and over 1.1 million were killed , out of which about 960,000 were @entity85			2
" we knew about the gas chambers			0
every few minutes they sent people to die			0
i always wondered when it was going to be my turn , but i never gave up hope			0
giving up meant you were going to die , but i wanted to live so badly , " she recounts her days at @entity9			1
she says it was her incredibly strong instinct to live that helped her get through every day			1
" even when they beat me i never cried			0
if they were going to kill me i did not want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me cry , " she explains			0
looking back , @entity0 says it is hard to put the feelings into words			1
prior to @entity9 she was in a @entity15 ghetto and the @entity107 concentration camp nearby , infamous for its sadistic treatment of prisoners			1
however , nothing compared to the horrors of @entity9 , she recalls			1
" one can talk about it and talk about it , but it is almost impossible to comprehend what a human being can endure and survive and what people can do to other people , " she explains shaking her head in disbelief			0
" what kind of people are capable of doing this to other human beings ? they must have had families and children themselves ' " @entity0 still wonders today			1
" i think they forgot how to be human , " she adds			0
as allied forces started closing in on concentration camps in @entity134 in 1944 and 1945 , many prisoners were either killed or moved to concentration camps further @entity136			0
in 1944 , @entity0 was transported to @entity137 , a concentration camp near @entity138 , @entity139			1
between 1944 and 1945 the number of prisoners at @entity137 tripled from around 7,300 to 22,000 according to the @entity142			0
many detainees were women , one of them was @entity0 , and another one was @entity146			1
@entity137 became scene of sheer horror as the camp became increasingly overcrowded			2
prisoners were starved for days , clean water was barely available and diseases started to spread killing tens of thousands in the beginning of 1945 alone			0
yet @entity0 's story of survival continued			1
on april 15th , 1945 , @entity0 's ordeal ultimately came to an end when @entity159 forces liberated the camp			1
after the liberation , @entity0 first went back to @entity18 , then to @entity162			1
in 1948 she moved to @entity139			0
" my husband fell ill and the best treatment was there , " she says to explain her move to the place that caused her so much pain in the past			0
@entity0 lost her family and her youth in the @entity172 , but she never lost her will to live			1
" maybe that is why i survived , i do n't know			0
i was also very , very lucky			0
it was a miracle , " she says			0
after the war she has tried not to think about what she had to go through			0
" @entity177 , you know " , she says			0
asked whether she would go back to see @entity9 today , she said : " my grandchildren have visited the museum at @entity9			1
i would n't go back , i have already been there			0

@entity0 , 90 , was only 15 years old when she was brought to @entity9
although her memory is fading , she can not forget the day she arrived at the death camp
she says it was her incredibly strong instinct to live that helped her get through every day
