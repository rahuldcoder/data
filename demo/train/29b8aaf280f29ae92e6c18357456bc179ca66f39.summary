the @entity3 you reach in corporate life when you 've made it			2
so , how do you get there ? the tried and tested route of hard work and influence gets you a long way certainly			2
stellar performance gets you noticed			2
a powerful network , an influential sponsor can give you a turbo boost on your way up			2
but though they will take you far , when it comes to the @entity1 , what gets you here -- as they say -- wo n't take you there			2
so , what is the difference that makes the difference when it comes to getting to the top ? in interviews with 268 senior executives , the @entity29 researched what marked out their people as destined for the top			1
they isolated three key qualities for success in corporate life : gravitas , communication and appearance			1
@entity40 mattered most , with 67 % of those surveyed naming it as the crucial quality			1
@entity40 marks you out as having what it takes to lead			2
and if you want to understand how gravitas works , and to harness it in your life , the best place to start is the ancient world			1
@entity40 is a @entity53 word which translates dignity , impressiveness , seriousness , influence , weight and presence			2
and what the @entity60 understood but the modern world seems to have forgotten is that , to borrow from roman emperor @entity64 , it 's possible for all of us to learn to " carry yourself with authority			1
" in my book " @entity40 : @entity75 ( @entity76 ) 2014 , " i explore what the ancient world has to teach us in the modern age about unlocking our innate gravitas			1
and if i were to share the absolute essential aspect of gravitas to success in leadership it would be your ability , as " pilot of the plane , " to handle turbulence			1
stability is the essence of gravitas			1
stable equilibrium is defined in physics as , " a state in which the body tends to return to its original position after being disturbed			2
" this inner emotional ballast is also key when it comes to gravitas			1
the @entity99 word " guru " means " weighty one , " implying someone who can not easily be knocked over			0
this stability -- emotionally , psychologically , physically -- is key to your gravitas			1
i learned most about this principle from a coach called @entity109 ( his nickname because of the wisdom he exudes )			0
@entity109 transforms the people he works with -- from having jerky , twitchy faces and voices and the knee - jerk reactions of people trying to cope with unsustainable workloads and stressful demands , they take on a far more grounded , centered presence ; they seem wiser , more resourceful ; and they get results -- big time			0
so , of course , i asked @entity109 his secret			0
what became clear was that @entity109 was teaching his clients that you have to be aware of and able to lead yourself before you effectively lead others			0
@entity109 told me a story about one of the young leaders at managing director ( @entity135 ) level			0
the @entity135 was focused and ambitious and had started to do the mindfulness practice @entity109 had suggested for him			0
at the beginning of each day he 'd spend 10 minutes becoming calm and centered			0
one day he found himself confronted directly by the chairman in a board meeting			0
@entity109 watched as three times the chairman attacked the young @entity135 's ideas			0
each time the @entity135 calmly and confidently held his ground , swinging the discussion round to his point of view			0
the chair , disarmed by the @entity135 's calm , graceful and focused response to his attack , started to listen			0
he agreed to the @entity135 's recommendations			0
later that day the @entity135 got a call from the ceo of the organization , who 'd watched this exchange of views in the board meeting : " we 've got 10 new jobs going in the management restructure , which one do you want ? " by staying present and steady the @entity135 had communicated his ideas without creating an argument and without caving in			0
he 'd held his ground and found his stability even as the political terrain shifted			0
others noticed and his life changed as a result			0
leadership of the self starts with knowing yourself			1
as @entity109 told me , self - awareness is key : " it helps you find a deep and compassionate center in yourself where you 're not dislodged or anxious because of what 's going on around you			1
you 've got an internal source -- your capacity , your own intelligence			0
when you learn to rest into that ... it expresses itself through your voice and your own consciousness			1
" as the @entity60 understood very well , your ability to manage yourself is a reflection of your leadership of a wider sphere			1
if you can be trusted to stand firm under pressure it suggests you might be able to manage others			0
and as the ancient world understood , calming the body is as key as educating the mind			1
in modern times you 'd do well to learn from them if you want to make your way to the @entity1			1
read this : how to channel anger , lust and greed read this : five ways to resign in style the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1

@entity209 says everyone can learn how to carry themselves with authority
she says that the ancient world can help executives unlock their inner gravitas
" leadership of the self starts with knowing yourself , " adds @entity209
