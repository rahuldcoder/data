thousands more art treasures could be destroyed in @entity2 and @entity3 , antiquities experts fear , after @entity5 released a video showing militants smashing artifacts at a museum in @entity10 , @entity2			1
" it 's tragic to see this destruction , " @entity11 , from the @entity13 - based @entity12 , told @entity1			0
" each time you see this you think it ca n't happen again , but it does			0
now other @entity23 treasures are at risk around @entity10 in @entity2 , as well as other artifacts in @entity26 and @entity27 in @entity3			1
" the video shows men taking sledgehammers to statues , and hammers and drills to the treasures			1
@entity34 , director general of @entity2 museums at the @entity36 , said friday on @entity37 he believed most of the artifacts shown in the @entity5 video were real -- including a famed , millennia - old winged bull that 's seen being defaced with a drill			1
" @entity42 has 173 original pieces , and there were preparations to reopen the @entity42 before @entity5 invaded the city on june 2014 , " @entity34 said			1
he added that @entity10 has more than 1,700 historical sites that are potentially at risk			1
an unnamed militant offers the following explanation : " these antiquities and idols behind me were from people in past centuries and were worshiped instead of @entity55			2
" when @entity57 orders to us destroy these statues , idols and antiquities , we must do it , even if they 're worth billions of dollars			1
" @entity1 has extensively reported on @entity5 ' destruction of some ancient and deeply meaningful sites in @entity2			1
officials there have said @entity5 has blown up shrines such as the tomb of @entity69			1
" if you 're going to eradicate someone 's identity the best way is to eradicate their art , " @entity11 said			2
" they see this art as blasphemous because it portrays deities			2
in areas of @entity3 , @entity5 is also attacking anything that 's pre-islamic or that they do n't agree with in @entity82 areas or in @entity84 churches			1
" most of the sculptures being destroyed were from the @entity88 period [ roughly 2500 to 605bc ] , @entity11 said			0
militants were pulling them over and smashing them ; bigger relief pieces were being smashed with hammers			1
" it 's very depressing and shocking			0
if they have control of the whole museum they could destroy the whole lot , or sell some pieces such as coins , tablets and cylinder seals			0
" it 's unclear from the footage how many of the pieces were originals , versus replicas			0
@entity11 said he hoped that some of the items were copies rather than the real thing , but added that at least some of those shown in the video were genuine			0
" much of the material in the museums was made out of limestone or fragile stone , so if you threw it to the floor it might look as though it was made of plaster of @entity125 , but really it 's just fragile			0
it 's tragic to see it			0
" @entity11 said that following vandalism at provincial museums in the wake of the first @entity133 , many antiquities were moved to @entity134 , where they were ransacked in 2003			0
" it appears that they had not been moved from this museum in @entity10			2
" other experts agreed that the items destroyed appeared to be genuine			2
" on repeated viewing of that very grainy video , we now suspect that there ( were ) far more originals in the museum than i first thought , " said @entity141 , chairwoman of the @entity142			0
" whilst there was indeed a program to relocate antiquities to safekeeping in @entity134 , it looks now as though it did n't reach that particular museum			0
