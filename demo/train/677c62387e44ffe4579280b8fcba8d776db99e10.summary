a leading humanitarian organization has urged soccer 's ruling body @entity1 and the @entity4 government to honor their commitment to reform employment laws for migrant workers ahead of the @entity8 , amid fears that stadiums will be built using an exploited labor force			1
@entity12 ( @entity12 ) has compiled a 146 - page report -- " building a better @entity8 : protecting migrant workers " -- examining @entity4 's recruitment and employment system , where 94 % of its workforce are migrant workers			1
the @entity4 government recently suggested it will replace the current sponsorship scheme -- where all foreigners must be sponsored by local employers to work and reside in the country -- with a system of contracts between employers and employees			1
but @entity12 said that it might prove of no benefit to the workers constructing the stadiums needed to host the tournament			0
" the government needs to ensure that the cutting - edge , high - tech stadiums it 's planning to build for @entity8 fans are not built on the backs of abused and exploited workers , " @entity12 's @entity33 director @entity32 said			1
" workers building stadiums wo n't benefit from @entity4 's general promise to end the sponsorship system			2
they need a deadline for this to happen before their work for the @entity1 games starts			0
" @entity4 is smaller than the @entity49 in land area , has less than 300,000 citizens , but boasts the highest per capita gdp in the world			0
but in @entity12 's interviews with 73 migrant construction workers they reported a host of problems , including unpaid wages , illegal salary deductions , crowded and unsanitary labor camps , and unsafe working conditions			2
the @entity4 @entity63 denies that workers are being exploited			1
" the @entity63 has received no complaint of forced labor and it is inconceivable that such a thing exists in @entity4 as the worker may break his contract and return to his country whenever he wishes and the employer can not force him to remain in the country against his will , " it said in a letter to @entity12 , an international non-governmental organization which conducts research on human rights			1
the report seeks to address apparent concerns over worker safety in @entity4 's construction industry and claims that discrepancies exist between the number of construction worker deaths reported by local embassies and the number reported by the government			0
while the @entity90 embassy reported 191 @entity90 worker deaths in 2010 , and the @entity93 embassy reported 98 @entity93 migrant deaths -- ncluding 45 deaths of young , low - income workers due to cardiac arrest , so far in 2012 -- the @entity98 says there have no more than six worker deaths over the last three years			0
@entity4 's success in being chosen by @entity1 as @entity8 hosts is likely to mean an anticipated construction boom in the @entity105 state			1
the local organizing committee for the tournament , the @entity108 for @entity4 22 , and the company it appointed to help oversee @entity8 construction , @entity111 , have said they will establish labor standards that builders and other contractors hired to build @entity8 venues must meet			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , has pledged to raise worker rights issues with the @entity4 government			1
those commitments are a beginning , @entity12 says , but it wants additional steps , including minimum employee standards in line with @entity4 law and international labor standards for private contractors involved in @entity8 - related construction			2
" ensuring international standards for workers ' rights and conditions has and will continue to be at the forefront of our committee 's strategic planning and implementation , " said the the @entity127			0
" we are fully committed to ensuring that preventative measures are in place to safeguard workers ahead of all construction projects directly relating to the @entity8			2
" @entity1 was not immediately available for comment .			0
