-- when it comes to plastic pollution , our society has asked everyone -- scientists , environmentalists , and the government -- to clean up the mess we 've made			1
through recycling initiatives , plastic - bag bans and fees , and alternatives to plastics altogether , we still have n't come close to solving the problem ... perhaps until now			2
the solution might have been discovered with a fungus in a laboratory @entity18			0
@entity20 was a student in @entity22 's class of 2010 whose passion for the environment made her want to make a difference			1
@entity26 wanted to find out if there was something in nature that could decompose plastic			2
she began experimenting with dozens of species of fungi from the @entity33 , but she graduated before she could finish her work			2
@entity35 took over for @entity26 but soon he was beginning to think maybe it just was n't possible			0
one day , as he casually walked into the lab he says his eyes locked on the @entity18 containing his experiment : the plastic was gone			0
he 'd found what they 'd been looking for			0
the @entity22 students had discovered that @entity45 fungus can break down plastic			1
it 's a species of fungi that can be found in many regions of the world and can decompose polyurethane , a common plastic that is used to make things like insulation , synthetic fibers , plastic for electronics and sealants			1
the fungus was 10 days old when the experiment started and in only a matter of days , he says , it had significantly decomposed about a quart size amount of the plastic			0
the study found that several species of fungi were able to at least partially decompose polyurethane , but this type was the only fungus able to do it in water without oxygen , one of the most challenging environmental conditions			1
@entity74 , the @entity22 biochemistry professor who instructed @entity26 and @entity35 during these experiments , says because of this discovery , the future looks promising for all types of plastic pollution			1
he says fungi 's potential to break down man - made materials could be endless , along with its possibilities in medicine and other fields of science			1
however , @entity35 warns that this is not the ultimate solution to solving plastic pollution			0
" i do n't want it to be broadcast as the cure - all to pollution , but it 's a modest step towards a very important goal , " he says			1
the full study will be published in the journal of @entity98 's september issue			0
dr. @entity99 , a biochemist at @entity100 , says he experimented in the past with using fungi for decomposition			2
he points out " the question of whether these microbes can be used in the future is an engineering challenge			0
it 's a big leap to go from the test tube to the field			1
" back in @entity74 's classroom , one of his students is working to find an organism that biodegrades styrofoam			1
@entity74 says the current crop of students is interested in seeking out more solutions like these and that they 'll continue to make discoveries like @entity35			0
today , @entity35 is working on his ph.d. in molecular biology at @entity125			0
he 's encouraged that other students are taking an interest in environmental solutions			2
" growing up in a world where pollution is going to be a big issue in the future , coming up with creative ways to tackle it , gets me excited , " @entity35 says			2
" i only hope that more people will take this on and get interested in it in the future			0

two @entity22 students find that a species of fungi can decompose polyurethane
a professor says the potential to break down man - made materials could be endless
one of the *researchers* *cautions* it 's not " the cure - all to pollution "
and a biochemist says , " it 's a big leap to go from the test tube to the field "
