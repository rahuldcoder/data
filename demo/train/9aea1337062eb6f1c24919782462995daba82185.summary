-- at one point in " @entity7 , " the new film of @entity4 's 2007 reunion concert in @entity5 , the camera stays long and tight on @entity9 's hands as they execute the introduction to " @entity12 " on the six - string neck of his double - neck @entity15 guitar			1
it is one of rock 's most iconic riffs , played in full and close - up by the composer , at one of his band 's greatest and most important shows			1
" with @entity4 , it has always been that mystique of how the music is done -- how it works , why it works , " @entity9 says on the phone from @entity5 a couple of weeks before @entity7 's worldwide theatrical premiere on october 17th			1
" the closer you can get in on that and the more lingering it is , the better			2
" " @entity7 , " which will be commercially released in various audio and visual formats on november 19 , is nothing more or less than @entity4 's entire two - hour performance on december 10 , 2007 , at @entity5 's @entity35			1
the concert , a benefit and tribute to the late @entity42 chief @entity41 , was the first full @entity4 show by @entity9 , singer @entity44 and bassist @entity45 since the death of drummer @entity47 in 1980			1
@entity47 's son , @entity48 , took his father 's place for the night , which is shown without backstage footage and includes minimal shots of the ecstatic audience			2
instead , director @entity55 -- who shot the concert with more than a dozen cameras -- provides extended close - ups of the band members in action : plant in bluestrance moan during " since i 've been @entity64 " ; @entity45 threading the folk - rock gallop of " @entity66 " with low - end countermelodies ; everyone turning to @entity48 in admiration during his volcanic solo at the end of " @entity72			1
" " @entity7 " is " almost like being onstage with us , " @entity45 says			1
" we always had that interaction , " he adds , referring to @entity4 's legendary concert prowess in the @entity75			1
" but nobody could see it , because the lighting was n't there			2
" before the @entity83 show , @entity45 notes , " i remember @entity55 saying in one of the early meetings , ' i 'm going to need 14 cameras			1
' everybody went , ' what ? ' it paid off			0
" page recalls walking off stage after the reunion concert feeling " really high			0
it was a serious test , and we passed it , all of us			0
and we had an extraordinary communion on the stage			0
that 's alive and well when you see it			2
" but it was quite a while -- page ca n't remember how long -- before he saw a rough cut of @entity55 ' footage ( " we did n't rush into the editing suite to have it out for @entity104 " )			0
in fact , @entity44 and @entity45 viewed that cut first			1
" we came away raving , " @entity45 says			1
" it was very fitting to the experience			0
we called @entity9 and said , ' you 've got ta see this			0
' " the @entity113 : @entity4 " the thing about @entity4 was that it was always four musicians at the top of their game , but they could play like a band , " @entity9 says			1
" even in the first couple of rehearsal days , running up to the @entity83 , we were playing pretty good			0
but we really wanted to shine as a band			0
" he cites the set list 's opening sequence -- from the surprise opener , " @entity127 , " from 1969 's @entity4 , into " @entity66 " and the tortuous crunch of " @entity126			1
" " i wanted people to feel , ' they 're taking this seriously			0
' " and i have to tell you , the rehearsals were all quite different , " @entity9 says , " so much in that @entity4 spirit and character			1
" to prove it , a deluxe edition of the @entity136 will include footage from the band 's only full - scale production rehearsal before the @entity83 concert			2
" you get the urgency of that night , but also the determination that was in rehearsal			0
" inevitably , @entity7 has set off more reunion talk			2
at a @entity5 press conference announcing the film , @entity44 raved about the @entity83 performance : " to get back in the middle of that music was a spectacular experience			2
" but he and @entity9 evaded questions about additional shows			0
when asked if the movie marks the end of @entity4 , once and for all , @entity45 -- who is busy writing an opera and collaborating with @entity162 and the @entity164 group @entity163 -- responds , " when i move house , i never look back at the house and go , ' oh , that 's the last moment i 'll see there			1
' i always move forward			0
" " that 's a good answer , " @entity9 says , laughing			2
but he is more direct			0
" i think if there had been any more concerts to be done , we 'd already be talking about them			0
so i do n't see it			0
" @entity7 , he adds , " is a testament to what we did in 2007			1
