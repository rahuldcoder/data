-- " year in review " time is upon us ! you ca n't go on the internet without being inundated with the top " fill in the blank " stories of the year -- from pop culture to politics to even the " top 10 twitter fights			2
" but these lists also remind me of the things i wish i had n't learned about in 2013			1
i do n't mean the events i wish had n't happened but the lessons from this year 's events that i wish i could have avoided			0
and i would wager that many of you would agree with at least a few of my choices			0
so here 's my list : 1			0
pope @entity23 ' compassion for the poor is a bad thing to some : i thought being concerned about the poor and wanting to help those less fortunate was a good thing			1
but @entity30 criticized the @entity31 for being " kind of liberal " ( which she views as a really bad thing ) though she did n't specify the offending words and later apologized			1
and @entity36 even labeled the @entity23 's words about capitalism , income inequality and urging world leaders to combat poverty as being " pure @entity42			1
" i guess the lesson for the @entity23 is do n't actually preach what 's in the @entity45 or else some on the right will call you names			1
one dance move on a basic cable tv show can popularize a new word in our collective vocabulary : i 'm speaking , of course , of , " twerking			0
" that dance may have been around for years , but it was n't until @entity57 twerked her way into the headlines at this year 's @entity60 that we all became intimately familiar with it			0
" thanks , " @entity57			0
you can lie to @entity64 under oath and still keep your job : in march , director of national intelligence @entity67 answered " no , sir " when asked during a congressional hearing whether the @entity71 was gathering " any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of @entity74			1
" of course , we found out a short time later about the @entity71 's massive surveillance program when @entity78 released classified documents			0
yet @entity67 was not charged with perjury nor even removed from his position for his less than fully honest answer to @entity64			0
( he did apologize for what he called " clearly erroneous " testimony			0
) in contrast , when ex-baseball pitcher @entity85 allegedly lied to @entity64 under oath in 2008 about using performance - enhancing drugs , he was charged with perjury and had to endure a criminal trial			2
we are so hypersensitive that people will even fight over fictitious characters : @entity95 ' @entity94 created a firestorm by saying that @entity97 is white			0
the amount of instant ( faux ) outrage may have hit an all - time high			2
and the more bizarre lesson i learned from this debate was that i agreed with @entity105 who said , in essence : " do n't we have more important things to worry about than @entity97 's skin color ? ! " 5			2
the leader of the free world ca n't get a website to work : @entity114 became law three - and - a - half years ago , but shockingly the website for president @entity118 's signature piece of legislation was a horrible failure when it rolled out in october			1
sure , the website is now functioning pretty well after a two - month makeover , but if i were president and there was a program known as " @entity125 " or " dean - aid , " i can assure you that the website for that program would 've been amazing from day 1			1
a crack smoking mayor can have a higher approval rating than the president of the @entity74 : @entity135 mayor @entity134 , who not only admitted to smoking crack , but made inane public statements and walked into everything from cameras to other elected officials , had a higher approval rating in november than president @entity118			1
could it be that @entity143 are too forgiving or are we too tough on our elected officials -- or both ? 7			0
we are the most self - centered generation ever : i 'm part of this self - absorbed generation so i 'm not being judgmental , just honest			1
we have become so narcissistic that the word " selfie " was the @entity153 's word of the year for 2013			2
we even saw the rise of " funeral seflies " where people take self - portraits at funerals often posing with the dead body			2
and thanks to @entity161 , we now have " @entity162 " -- where you take a self - portrait of your buttocks and share that with the world			2
i ca n't even imagine the type of " selfies " we will see in 2014 but it may involve a tiny camera being inserted into body cavities			0
90 % of @entity74 could support a proposed law and @entity64 still wo n't pass it : prior to 2013 , i would have bet money that if 90 % of us supported the passage of a law that could save @entity74 lives , @entity64 would enact it			1
yet this year even though that percent of @entity74 supported universal background checks for all gun sales , it still could n't get through our dysfunctional @entity64			1
apparently we need 100 % of @entity74 to support it before @entity64 will act			1
do n't go on vacation with @entity182 and @entity183 : when i checked into my hotel for a vacation earlier this year , i was told that the sequel to @entity182 and @entity183 's hit film " @entity188 " was being filmed there			0
the result was a nightmare of closed hotel facilities and a mass of extras swarming the hotel			0
so if you check into your hotel for a quiet vacation and find out that a big studio movie will be shooting there , check out			0
what unwelcome lessons did 2013 bring for you ? i 'd love to hear your thoughts in the comment section below			1
and best wishes for a 2014 filled with health , happiness -- and fewer lessons you wish you could have avoided			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			1

@entity208 says 2013 taught us a lot of things we 'd rather forget
some think pope @entity23 ' views about the poor are a bad thing
we are the most self - centered generation ever , he says
@entity208 : a crack - smoking mayor can have a higher approval rating than the president of the @entity74
