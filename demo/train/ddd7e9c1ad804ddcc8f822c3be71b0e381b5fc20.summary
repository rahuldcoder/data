-- the @entity1 of @entity2 said friday it has identified at least two employees believed to be involved in creating a list containing the personal information of a purported 1,300 alleged illegal immigrants			1
" at this point we do n't think it was a very large conspiracy			0
we think it was two , maybe			0
we have suspicion of a couple of more people , a very small group , " said @entity11 , the executive director of the @entity12			0
" release of such private , sensitive information is deplorable , " gov. @entity16 said in a news release			1
" we immediately took action to discover the origins of this list , and i 'm pleased with the hard work of the @entity12			2
when someone does business with the state of @entity28 , they deserve to know that their private information will be kept private			1
" @entity16 told @entity0 's @entity31 on friday night that the 1,300 people have @entity34 names and not all of them are in the state illegally			1
the two employees have been placed on administrative leave pending completion of the full investigation and other employees may be identified as the review continues , the news release said			1
the @entity28 attorney general 's office will review data from the investigation for possible further action			1
" the people we 've identified certainly have some strong political opinions and seem to be frustrated with some of the issues around immigration , " @entity11 said			0
" regardless of what their frustration is , they work for the @entity12 and for state government			2
they understand what the rules are			0
and if they want to go rogue , they need to quit the department			0
i think it 's immense hypocrisy to take someone to task for being illegal and doing so by breaking the law			2
" the state focused on the @entity28 @entity12 , @entity16 's office said thursday , because all of the information on the 29 - page list -- including contact information , @entity77 numbers and pregnancy due dates -- is contained within that agency 's database			1
information from the investigation may be turned over to state prosecutors , a statement from the office said			1
the list was anonymously distributed to media and government offices across the state , @entity0 affiliate @entity87 reported			1
an accompanying letter from " @entity92 " insisted that those on the list should be deported immediately			2
thursday , a group of @entity34 activists told reporters that the list had sparked widespread fear			2
" our community is very concerned , very worried about it , " said @entity100 with @entity101			0
" i would say they have been terrorized , many of them			0
people are just afraid of what 's happening			0
" those named on the list are even more frightened , said @entity111 with the @entity112 of @entity113			2
" for these 1,300 people , unfortunately that fear has escalated , " he said			2
" there 's an arrest warrant out , essentially			0
that fear never goes away			0
" @entity16 said friday , " some are scared and apprehensive			1
i expect that comes with the status of being illegal			1
if i was in the country illegally , i would probably have fear and apprehension , too			0
" @entity127 co-chairman @entity126 told @entity0 affiliate @entity128 that he had some concerns about privacy and how the names were procured , but he would have released a similar list if he could have			2
" if it were a reliable list and it had come from a source that was acknowledged and vetted , then yes , i would absolutely support something like that , " he said			0
but @entity16 said friday the information should n't have gone out to anyone , even the government agency charged with enforcing immigration law			1
" it 's a violation of federal law to take this information and give it to @entity143 , whether it 's out there or not , " the governor said , referring to the federal @entity143 agency			1
" if we have laws on the books , they need to be enforced and we 're enforcing it here on this breach of the law as it appears on disclosing confidential information , " @entity16 said			1
" but i also believe the issue at hand , the underlying issue of illegal immigration , is something that needs to be addressed also			0
we know the frustration of the people out there because of the inaction of the federal government , in particular , in enforcing the law			0
" @entity16 has plans to bring together a " spectrum " of viewpoints , some " diametrically opposed , " for a roundtable discussion on immigration reform in @entity28 on tuesday			1
" we see what 's happened in @entity173			0
so @entity28 , like other states right now , are saying if the federal government is not going to do something , we will take steps to do something ourselves within the parameters of the law			1
it may mean creating new law , " he said .			0
