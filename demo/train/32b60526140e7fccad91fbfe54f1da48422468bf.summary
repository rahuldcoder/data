-- @entity2 economist @entity1 is an outspoken critic of international aid , arguing for years that foreign handouts stifle @entity6 's development , perpetuate corruption and hinder the continent 's growth			1
a @entity11 bestselling author , @entity1 first grabbed international headlines with her 2009 book " dead aid : why aid is not working and how there is a @entity17			1
" since then , she 's penned two more books , on the subject of the decline of the @entity22 , and the effects of @entity25 's commodities rush			1
in a new interview with @entity0 's @entity27 , @entity1 explains why she 's optimistic about the future of @entity6			1
she looks at the positive impact that @entity25 can have on the continent and details the key drivers that will spur @entity6 's economic growth			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : the aid debate is so different from before ... @entity1 : so much has happened in the last five years -- whether you 're in @entity6 , @entity37 or @entity38 , nobody talks about aid anymore			1
policy makers themselves are going out and issuing debts in the market			0
my own country , @entity2 , did a fantastic bond , a $ 750 million 10 - year bond , last september			2
the discussion is so much more about job creation and investment , which is such a fantastic story and it 's obviously partly to do with the fact that the traditional donors are having a financial problem , fiscal problem , on their balance sheets			2
they just do n't have the capital anymore to hand out cash like they did in the past			0
@entity0 : the @entity25 story has been thrown into the mix , has that changed the landscape ? @entity66 : yes , absolutely , but in a strange way it 's exactly what we need in terms of delivering economic growth and meaningfully reducing poverty			1
we need jobs , we need investment , we need trade , we need foreign direct investment , whether investment domestically but also from the outside			0
it 's not some magic pill , everybody knows that this is the formula , and finally the @entity25 are showing up , again , not just in @entity6 , but around the world with that elixir , that mix of opportunities to really transform these countries			1
remember , 70 % of the populations of these places is under the age of 24			0
there is no escape : we have to create jobs			0
read this : how ' @entity96 ' will shape @entity6 's future @entity0 : a lot of people are critical of @entity25 " neo-colonialism " but you argue that 's not the case			1
@entity66 : well , it 's not , because @entity25 has so many economic problems in itself			1
you know , this is a population of 1.3 billion people with 300 million people that live at the level of @entity113 living style			0
so they 've got a billion people to move out of poverty			0
the notion that they would be spending their time trying to colonize other places is just , frankly , absurd			0
i 'm not saying that @entity25 should be given a red carpet , carte blanche , to come into @entity6 or , indeed , anywhere in the world , and do what they like			1
we do need the investment , we need job creation and we do need actual trade in these places			0
but i think what 's really essential is to focus on what @entity25 can do for @entity6 , as well as what @entity6 can do for @entity25			1
and i think that discussion is not had as objectively as it should be			0
ultimately , the responsibility of how @entity25 engages in @entity6 is really at the domain of the @entity6 governments			1
we would not be worried about the risks of neo-colonialism or abuse , environmental abuse and labor issues , if we trusted the @entity6 governments to do the right thing			2
@entity0 : how do you see the trends playing out in the next decades ? @entity66 : i 'm an eternal optimist			0
i 'm probably the wrong person to ask , because i do believe that the structural and fundamental structures of @entity6 right now are poised for a very good few decades			2
if you look at an economy through the lens of capital , which is basically money ; labor , which is basically how many people do you have and what skills do they have ; and productivity , which is just , how efficiently they use capital and labor , the trend is very clearly in favor of @entity6			1
read this : african ceos look to bright future we 've got a very solid fiscal story			0
the debt - to - gdp ratios in @entity6 today at the sovereign level are nowhere near the burdens that we are seeing in @entity171 and the @entity172			2
the labor story is very positive -- 60 - 70 % of @entity6 are under the age of 25			2
so a young population dynamically needs to be leveraged , so definitely we need to invest in skills and education to make sure that we get the best out of this young population			0
and then , in terms of productivity , this continent is a great absorber of technologies and all the things that can help us become more efficient			0
therefore , these three key drivers : capital , labor , and productivity , help spur economic growth			1
now is it going to be smooth sailing ? of course not -- there will be volatility , but i think the real investors in @entity6 will be able to make a delineation between risk and uncertainty			2
@entity0 : and it 's about a country 's resources , too , right ? @entity66 : that 's a brilliant question , because actually the answer is no. i think it 's really about the structural things that i mentioned : capital , labor , productivity			1
why do i say that ? let 's take a look at the @entity6 stock market			2
there are about 20 stock exchanges in @entity6 and about 1,000 stocks that trade in @entity6 -- 85 % of them are non-commodities			2
we 're talking about banking , we 're talking about insurance , we 're talking about retail , we 're talking about consumer goods , logistics companies , telecommunications companies , those are the stocks that are on the @entity6 stock market			0
@entity0 : do you feel a sense of responsibility to represent the @entity6 success story ? @entity66 : well , i suppose , for me , i feel a responsibility to tell the truth			0
this is a great continent			0
i went to primary school on this continent , secondary school , university , i 've worked on this continent and i think that it 's a great disservice that , for whatever reason , people have usurped an imagery of @entity6 that is absolutely incorrect			2
they focus on war , disease , corruption and poverty			0
that is not all about @entity6 and i think it 's really essential if we 're going to turn the corner , we need to take that responsibility , as governments , as citizens , not just @entity6 , global citizens to say , " that 's actually not true			1
" there are more poor people in @entity262 than there are in @entity6 ; more poor people in @entity25 than there are in @entity6 , but somehow there 's a stigma for decades that 's been associated with the @entity6 continent that is completely unjustified -- and it 's that i find objectionable .			1
