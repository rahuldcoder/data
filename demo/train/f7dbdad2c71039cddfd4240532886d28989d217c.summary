@entity1 , @entity0 -- later this summer , a motor rally will make its way across @entity5			1
nothing strange in that you might think			0
but this is a race with a difference -- a " banger rally " if you like -- and one with a well - tuned environmental message			2
@entity12 is leading a " chip fat " rally to @entity14 in august 2008			1
the " grease to @entity14 " expedition will attempt to travel from the @entity17 to @entity14 powered exclusively by chip fat scrounged from a variety of restaurants , kebab shops and burger vans en route			1
organizer @entity12 said : " the aim is to see if using vegetable oil for long distances is practical and feasible , and to have a bit of a laugh on the way			1
" @entity12 , who lives in @entity30 , is no stranger to environmentally - friendly jaunts			0
in 2007 , @entity12 successfully drove a bio-truck powered by waste chocolate from the @entity17 to @entity34			1
the starting point for this summer 's road trip is , not surprisingly , a 1950 's style greasy spoon cafe in @entity30			0
the team will then set off for the continent traveling down through @entity40 -- stopping off at the nurburgring for the @entity43 stage -- before heading off towards @entity44 and then @entity45 , before following the @entity47 coast down to @entity14			1
the " fat finding " mission , as organizers have dubbed it , will start on the 16th august			0
it will take around two weeks to reach the finish line			0
if teams find waste oil hard to come by they can load up with fresh cooking oil from supermarkets			1
but the aim is to show that carbon neutral motoring , using waste fat as a biofuel , is achievable			2
@entity12 told @entity2 that he currently has 15 spaces filled and that there are still a few places left			0
" all you need is a diesel car , " he said			0
with conventional fuel prices high and rising , @entity12 could n't have picked a better time to take on the challenge			2
next year , he plans to fly from the @entity17 to @entity70 powered by fuel created from landfill waste			1
the idea is to highlight the process of making low - carbon aviation fuel			0
" it 's such an exciting concept because it could revolutionize the aviation industry and the way we think about travel , " @entity12 said			2
" the key factors are that it needs to economically and environmentally viable			0
so far the experiments that have been done have n't really hit the mark yet , but it 's good that they are developing the ideas			0
