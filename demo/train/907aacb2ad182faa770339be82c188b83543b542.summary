@entity0 -- when i first met the wiry - looking fellow , i had no idea he was a musical genius			1
nor did i know his instrument of choice			1
nor that i was about to witness the last breaths of a generation			1
i had strolled into @entity0 simply looking for some good photos			1
just some good photos and some good times			1
it was @entity15 , of course , and it was 1975			1
by strict calendar standards , the 1960s were long over , but few generations pay heed to the calendar , nor did my new friend , who called himself " the @entity23 of @entity24			1
" the @entity23 was probably 10 years my senior , and he was instantly likeable			1
he walked with a slight tilt , told remarkable stories about his childhood and accomplishments , and had something slung over his shoulder			1
i did n't pay much attention to it			1
but when we walked onto @entity24 , others took note			1
best bites in the @entity0 " @entity37 ! @entity23 ! " revelers shouted			1
" play me some broom ! " he appeared annoyed , but it was an act			1
he removed a leather guitar case shaped like a broom from his back			2
he placed it on the street , unclasped the lid , and ceremoniously pulled out a standard kitchen broom			2
i expected him to start noisily " sweeping " the street -- perhaps to the beat of a familiar song			2
" i knew a man , @entity53 , and he danced for you ... " @entity55 , thwap			2
" in worn out shoes ... " @entity55 , thwap , thwap			2
" but instead , he clutched the broom as if it was a rare @entity60			2
he raised his right hand aloft like a rock god			2
and he unleashed his fury			2
" @entity64 , dah dah dah dah ! " he screamed			2
" @entity64 , dah dah dah dah ! " yes , the @entity23 had aced the opening licks to " @entity66			1
from seemingly nowhere , a hundred @entity67 materialized , strumming a thousand air guitars , " @entity64 , dah dah dah dah ! " a thousand @entity69 started prancing			2
" but it 's all - right now , ' n fact it 's a gas ! " and the @entity23 led his tribe down @entity24 , singing and strumming a rock anthem			1
" it 's alllll right ! @entity66 , it 's a gas , gas , @entity77 ! " what to do in @entity0 between meals every photographer , like every fisherman , has a story about the one that got away			1
my " missed it " moment involved the @entity23			1
i had spent the previous two days lugging around too damn many cameras , shooting the @entity89 parades and @entity91 insanity			2
on both days , i weighed the benefits of continuing to shoot the event , or ditching the cameras and joining the party			2
on day three , the party won			2
that was the day i bumped into the @entity23			1
even in the @entity0 , which has the highest character - per - square - mile ratio that @entity99 allows , the @entity23 was a standout			1
he clearly lived on the fringes of normal society , but clearly sought its endorsement -- it 's official government endorsement			1
he said he had invented " mismatched boots " ( which could have explained his lopsided walk ) and said he held a patent -- an official government patent ! -- for them			0
he said he had written a song with very dirty lyrics , and had gotten a copyright -- an official government copyright ! -- for it			0
that , he enthused , meant those dirty lyrics were enshrined forever at the @entity117 in @entity118 -- right under the unsuspecting eyes of @entity120 ! i had n't the heart to tell him the government would copyright nearly anything			0
for the better part of the day , we walked around the @entity91 , the @entity23 strumming for his appreciative fans , honoring their requests , but looking at them cross-eyed when they asked him to play the little brush clipped to his belt			1
you ca n't play a brush , he 'd say , disdainfully			0
toward evening , we retired from the @entity24 mayhem to the calm of @entity137			0
there , away from the relentless demands of fame , the @entity23 hooked up with some old friends -- @entity141 and a few other troubadours			1
@entity143 and the others were softly plucking at their instruments when a burly cop strode over			0
in height and heft , he was straight out of @entity149			0
and in lieu of stripes , he wore his attitude on his sleeves			0
now , the role of the police officer at the height of @entity15 has been little explored -- but it should be			0
sworn to uphold the law , they are nonetheless expected to restrain their instincts when dealing with the organized disorderly conduct known as fat tuesday			0
so who can blame an officer who , amid the @entity15 madness , happily discovers a law that can be enforced ? the officer 's countenance stiffened as he approached the small group of musicians , as if he had stumbled upon a meeting of mass murderers			1
" hey , " he barked , with unimpeachable authority			0
. music ... in the ... park ! " the guitars fell silent			0
satisfied , the cop turned and started to walk away			0
it was of little account , i know			0
but even then , i had a feeling that i was seeing an era slip away			1
the writing was on the wall			0
already , the cool and cruel winds of disco were blowing across the land			0
soon , @entity24 would be filled with polyester suits , blow - dried hair and @entity191 hits			0
and encounters like these , between cops and felonious musicians , would be a thing of the past			0
maybe the cop felt that way , too			0
he stood there , facing away , as if he had left some business unfinished			0
he turned around and pointed his beefy finger at the band			0
and he sealed the deal			0
" that goes for @entity206 , too ! " he said			0
that moment was made in photo heaven -- a gift from the photo gods			1
the ' 60s were finally over			0
all wrapped up in a perfect @entity215 moment			0
and me , without my camera .			0

@entity1 's @entity219 *recalls* a photo *opportunity* that got away
a character he met in @entity0 in the mid- ' *70s* made a lasting impression
the " @entity23 " marked the end of an era for this author
