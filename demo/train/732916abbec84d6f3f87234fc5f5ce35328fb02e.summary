-- we 're going to feel a little guilty if this news gets you fired			0
but you can now play " @entity6 " on @entity5			1
@entity8 's ridiculously addictive mobile game , which has been downloaded more than 500 million times on multiple platforms since debuting on the @entity11 in 2009 , hit @entity5 on tuesday			1
while the company had leaked out news that the merger of the game 's millions of fans and @entity5 's hundreds of millions of users was coming , a @entity5 " launch event " was scheduled for 6 p.m. et on tuesday			1
but players , including , presumably , the 15 million who were already fans of the game on @entity5 , can start slingshotting their feathered friends now			2
in addition to allowing players to pay for special in - game tools , such as more powerful birds , the @entity5 version of " @entity6 " also adds a social - gaming element			1
besides posting their scores to their news feed , players can send in - game gifts to friends and get special rewards for earning some of the game 's highest scores			2
@entity8 's chief marketing officer ( or " @entity39 " in bird - speak ) @entity6 told the blog @entity41 that the @entity43 company hopes as many as 40 % of players will pay for bonus items -- a far higher rate than for other social games like " @entity48 " or " @entity49			1
" upgrades will cost 99 cents each			0
from an early look , the game appears to play much like the original version that appeared on @entity55 devices			2
the difference , obviously , is that players use a mouse instead of a finger to pull back the bird slingshot			0
they also must toggle the screen size up and down on a sliding scale instead of pinching a touchscreen			0
it 's a play style that will be familiar to people who played the game on @entity67 -- a version that rolled out last year			0
players can switch to full - screen mode ( which is sure to be noticed by your boss , unfortunately ) and personalized avatars will be available soon , according to the company .			0

" @entity6 " makes its debut on @entity5
the wildly *popular* game appeared on the social - *networking* site tuesday
@entity81 will be free to play , but players must pay for bonus items and abilities
