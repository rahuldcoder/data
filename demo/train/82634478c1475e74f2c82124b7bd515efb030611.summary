-- @entity1 was the only bear known to have been living wild in @entity4 , according to the @entity4 national broadcaster			1
despite that status , the young male was shot tuesday morning in @entity8 , in the @entity9 near the @entity11 border , by authorities who feared he was a threat to people			1
the brown bear had become dangerous because he regularly sought out food in inhabited areas -- including a school -- and had started following people during the day , the @entity15 said			0
the creature also showed little fear of humans despite several attempts to get it away from villages , it said			2
there was so much concern about the bear 's behavior , he was fitted with a radio collar so he could be closely monitored			0
and in november of last year , he was classified as a " problem bear			1
" when @entity1 emerged from his winter hibernation recently , that pattern of behavior was repeated , pushing authorities to act , the environment office said in a prepared statement wednesday			2
" @entity43 had certainly never showed any aggression toward man , but the risk that an accident might happen and that people might be badly injured or killed had become intolerable , " it said			2
nonetheless , news of his death prompted grief and outrage on a @entity55 page set up by supporters of @entity1			1
some questioned why he was n't relocated or placed in a zoo rather than being shot by wildlife officers			0
the @entity4 branch of the @entity62 environmental campaign group said it was " extremely disappointed " that the bear was killed			1
@entity64 , an expert on bears at the @entity62 , said it was far too soon to shoot @entity1			2
@entity1 " was in no way a problem bear , " she said , adding that wildlife officers should have continued efforts to make him more frightened of humans			1
" his death is the result of a lack of acceptance of bears in @entity78 , which is a direct consequence of a lack of information among the population , " she said			0
the risk remains that other bears might follow in @entity1 's paw prints and stray into @entity4 's @entity87 area			1
according to the @entity15 , @entity1 was one of about 40 individuals originating in the @entity91 area of @entity11 , where a reintroduction program is under way			1
the bear 's name comes from the system of identifying bears from that @entity11 population , with @entity99 standing for males and @entity101 for females , said @entity62 spokesman @entity103			2
@entity1 was the 13th male from that group to be born in the wild			1
faced with the migration of these bears , @entity4 authorities have the dilemma of whether to try to protect the population as a whole or a few individuals , the environment office said			0
" in order to give the bear population a chance to reestablish itself in @entity4 , circumstances sometimes arise when unfortunately an individual must be killed , " it said			1
eight bears have entered @entity4 since 2006 , the @entity62 said			0
if others follow , they should not be killed " simply because we have n't done our homework , " said @entity64			0
the @entity62 advises that people in areas where bears may be present safeguard livestock , put garbage in bear - proof trashcans and protect beehives			0
and for the brown bear to survive in the @entity9 , its human neighbors must accept it , @entity64 said			0
@entity4 is not the only country to struggle with the question of how to help humans and natural predators coexist without friction			2
in the @entity141 , lawmakers in @entity140 voted last year to allow limited hunting of wolves , after they were removed from federal protection			0
conservation groups , including the @entity146 , opposed the decision , but the @entity140 - based @entity148 argued that wolves are a threat to domestic animals wherever the two coexist .			0

new : @entity154 called @entity1 " was in no way a problem bear , " says conservation group expert
it showed little fear of humans , @entity4 wildlife service says
the young male was killed in an @entity164 near the border with @entity11
supporters of @entity1 express their grief and outrage on @entity55
