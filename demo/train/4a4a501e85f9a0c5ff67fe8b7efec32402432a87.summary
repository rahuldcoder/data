-- how does sen. @entity1 curry favor with @entity4 voters and at the same time burnish his tea party credentials ? easy			1
by saying one thing and doing another			0
on may 10 , @entity1 , a @entity8 @entity7 , attempted to reframe his @entity10 proposal to give special visas to children of undocumented workers if they attend college or serve in the military			1
he said , " but i would just say this is really not an immigration issue ; it 's a humanitarian issue			1
" on that same day , he quietly submitted a bill that would severely threaten humanitarian assistance to nearly 4 million children living in poverty			2
but to @entity1 they are guilty by association			1
through no fault of their own their parents are undocumented workers			0
currently , a credit is available to undocumented workers who report their income to the @entity34 through the @entity36 program , created in 1996 , making them eligible for a @entity37			0
for many children , this payment ( $ 1,000 per child ) is the difference between abject poverty and the ability to survive			0
the program is , in fact , the ultimate conservative brainchild			0
it 's not a handout ; rather it 's a way to give working people the ability to subsist , and to keep their children off entitlement programs			0
it is the kind of program that @entity53 championed in the 1980s as a dignified alternative to welfare for the working poor			0
@entity1 's proposal -- the @entity57 of 2012 -- would stiffen the filing requirements for @entity36 applicants			1
this is being done , according to a @entity1 spokesperson , in an attempt to " crack down on fraud at the expense of taxpayers			1
" the @entity66 characterizes @entity1 's contentions as overstated , and says the proposed bill will greatly harm innocent children who rely on the tax cuts for food on the table , school books and shelter			1
there is nothing " humanitarian " about terminating assistance to nearly 4 million @entity24 children who depend on such support			0
and there is nothing humanitarian about his " @entity10 without the dream , " a palliative offer of legality without a clear path to citizenship			1
such a proposal is nothing more than crumbs thrown to @entity90 , who rubio apparently hopes are n't paying attention			0
lurking near the top of the list of running mates for @entity7 presidential candidate @entity96 , @entity1 is seen by many in the @entity7 as the key to the @entity4 vote			2
yet the heart of his @entity7 support comes from the anti-immigration extreme right , while an overwhelming majority of @entity4 support immigration reform			0
it ca n't be easy for this son of a maid and a bus driver -- both @entity110 immigrants -- to reconcile those contradictions			0
would a latino running mate help @entity96 ? the hypocrisy of @entity1 's recent moves paints a vivid picture of the unbridled ambition of an individual who plays on the politics of resentment and fear at the expense of children			1
imagine a patient in critical condition bleeding of multiple stab wounds			0
@entity1 talks about putting a @entity125 on the patient 's little finger , while silently stabbing him in the back			2
in march i wrote that " @entity1 needs a ' @entity130 , " insisting that the senator should use his conservative credentials to courageously break the logjam in immigration reform			1
i was at first encouraged to see him step into this debate , but unlike the rabidly @entity136 , who traveled to @entity137 to promote @entity138 , @entity1 instead travels to key battleground states -- @entity8 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity145 , tea party turf -- to peddle his autobiography			1
it 's unfortunate that two of @entity1 's closest mentors , former @entity8 gov. @entity150 and @entity8 @entity7 rep. @entity151 , who both support comprehensive immigration reform , ca n't shake their @entity154 © by the shoulders and set him straight			1
@entity156 : what latinos want from candidates ? respect perhaps they could suggest that he turn from promoting his own book to studying @entity163 's recently published " @entity162 , " the fourth installment of the biography of @entity166			2
@entity163 depicts a scene the night before @entity166 's first major address as president , to a joint session of @entity171 , in which his closest advisers urged him not to make civil rights a central tenet of his presidency			2
they argued it would antagonize the conservative @entity178 who controlled @entity171 , and threaten his presidency			0
@entity163 writes that one adviser " told him to his face that a president should n't spend his time and power on lost causes , no matter how worthy those causes might be			0
" the former conservative senator from @entity188 retorted , " well , what the hell 's the presidency for ? " @entity166 's leadership and political genius in passing civil rights legislation brought a measure of justice for millions of people to whom justice had long been denied			1
as @entity1 abandons @entity4 families , he should ask himself : " what the hell is a @entity201 seat for ? " he sure does n't seem to know			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			2

@entity204 : @entity1 has been *hypocritical* on the immigration issue
he says @entity1 , a *potential* *vp* choice , moved to tighten tax credit for immigrant children
the @entity8 senator backs weakened @entity10 while opposing needed tax credit
@entity204 : @entity1 should follow example of @entity166 , who realized value of holding public office
