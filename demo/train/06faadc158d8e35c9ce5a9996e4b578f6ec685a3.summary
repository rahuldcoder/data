a 17 - year - old @entity3 student who spent 52 days in a medically induced coma after police used a taser on him at school entered a full - time rehabilitation facility friday , his family 's attorney said			1
@entity9 was transported to the hospital on november 20 after @entity12 sheriff 's deputy @entity11 , serving as a school resource officer , used the device on him after the teen tried to defuse a school fight involving two girls , one of them his girlfriend , said attorney @entity20			1
the parents have filed a lawsuit alleging their son never posed a threat to the deputy and that @entity9 suffered a permanent brain injury when he hit the ground after @entity11 tased the teen			1
the family is also asking the @entity30 to outlaw the devices , along with pepper spray , on state campuses			1
several civil liberties groups , including the @entity35 , sent a letter to the @entity30 last month calling the use of such weapons on children " unconscionable			2
" " @entity3 families deserve to send their children to school without fear , knowing they can trust their schools to be safe havens , " the letter said			1
a jumpy surveillance video provided by @entity20 shows @entity9 amid a commotion in the hallway of @entity50 , about 20 miles southeast of @entity51			0
the teen appears to be stepping backward , away from the officer , when he is hit with the stun gun and falls to the floor			1
" as a result of being tased , @entity56 fell to the ground , striking his head on the floor			2
while @entity56 was unconscious , defendant @entity11 placed him in handcuffs , " the family 's lawsuit says			2
school officials did not immediately call paramedics , the lawsuit says			2
when they did , @entity9 was taken to a local hospital and later airlifted to @entity71 's @entity70 in nearby @entity51 , where he " underwent surgery to repair a severe brain hemorrhage and was placed in a medically induced coma , " court documents say			1
the lawsuit claims @entity11 used excessive force and that @entity9 " posed no imminent threat of death or serious injury to @entity79			0
" it asks for compensatory damages and attorney 's fees and expert 's fees , among other relief			0
@entity87 of the @entity88 said the department could not comment because of the pending litigation , but a court document from the county 's attorneys alleged that @entity9 " failed to comply with the lawful orders of @entity95 and therefore @entity95 used the reasonable amount of necessary force to maintain and control discipline at the school			1
" " the actions of @entity95 were the actions of a reasonable officer , " the court documents say			1
@entity103 , executive director of the @entity104 , defended @entity11 's use of a taser in an interview with @entity109 affiliate @entity108 , saying @entity9 appeared coherent after the incident and apologized to the officers			1
" he was saying ' i should n't have done that , ' " @entity103 said			0
" when they got him to the hospital , he again got out of control and became aggressive to hospital personnel to the point they called the sheriff 's office again and said , ' we need help over here			0
' " @entity20 called @entity103 's account " 100 % false " and " complete nonsense			0
" the lawyer further noted that doctors at @entity125 quickly sedated the teen before having him airlifted to the @entity51 hospital			2
" the video speaks for itself			0
( @entity130 ) was not acting aggressively , " the attorney said			0
" the deputies were very aggressive in coming up to this situation			0
i think this officer made up his mind to go to @entity106 very quickly			2
" " he never struck the police officer			1
he never disobeyed instructions , " @entity20 added			0
@entity138 , legal director for @entity139 , a group that fights for social and economic justice in @entity3 -- and a signatory to the @entity35 letter calling for a taser ban in schools -- said there is no state or national data on how frequently @entity106 are deployed on students			1
the letter to the @entity30 cites more than a dozen media reports on officers who used tasers or pepper spray on students , and @entity138 cited high - profile cases in @entity156 , @entity157 , and @entity158 , @entity159 , but said she suspects such media reports are " just the tip of the iceberg			0
" @entity139 would be open to discussing with law enforcement how best to use the devices when a student has a gun or other weapon , she said , " but that 's not how it 's being used , for the most part			0
" the @entity3 juvenile justice system does n't allow @entity106 , and it has specific limitations on when to use pepper spray , so @entity138 said she does n't understand how the state can condone the use of such devices in places of learning			0
" there are other methods of de-escalating fights that would n't pose the same risk , " she said			0
