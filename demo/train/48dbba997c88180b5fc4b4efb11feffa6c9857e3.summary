-- @entity2 's licenses and other state benefits are at the heart of a new battle in the national immigration debate			1
@entity8 gov. @entity7 fired the opening salvo last week , on the same day that federal authorities began accepting applications for a program aimed at helping tens of thousands of young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children			1
@entity7 ordered officials in her state not to provide driver 's licenses or any other benefits to immigrants granted " deferred status " under the new federal program , which allows accepted applicants to remain in the @entity26 and work without fear of deportation for at least two years			1
undocumented immigrants take chance of a lifetime " a lot of these issues are in uncharted waters			1
in this particular area , which is how do you treat people that are deferred action , there 's very little legal precedent to go by , " said @entity37 , director of the @entity39 's office at the @entity40			1
" states are making their own judgments			0
" that means the actual benefits recipients see could depend on where they live			1
governors in @entity54 and @entity55 have already followed @entity7 's lead			0
" the state of @entity54 will continue its practice of not issuing driver 's licenses , welfare benefits or other public benefits to illegal immigrants unless specifically authorized by @entity54 statute , " gov. @entity57 said friday			1
@entity55 gov. @entity66 has said that the federal immigration " directive does not undermine or change our state laws , " writing in a letter to the state 's attorney general that the federal guidelines " confer absolutely no legal status whatsoever " on any immigrant who qualifies			2
but @entity77 is moving toward granting licenses to the influx of undocumented immigrants expected to take advantage of the federal policy , as is @entity83			2
" we 're still trying to sort out what this new limbo category means for states , " said @entity84 , program director of the @entity85 at the @entity86			1
under the new policy , people younger than 30 who arrived in the @entity26 before the age of 16 , pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military , can get a two - year deferral from deportation and apply for work permits			0
a memo outlining the @entity103 administration 's policy states that the program does not grant legal status			1
but it does provide for a work permit and , presumably , the benefits that come with it			0
the policy does n't grant " legal status , " but does give " legal presence , " @entity84 said			2
state authorities , she said , are struggling to answer a key question : " what do these two terms mean , and how do they intersect ? " undocumented immigrants line up for relief from deportation for @entity7 , @entity57 and @entity66 , the two do n't intersect			2
" if lawful status is required to receive a benefit , an individual will need to seek lawful status , not deferred action , " @entity66 spokeswoman @entity121 said			2
so if undocumented immigrants in their states could n't get licenses before , they ca n't get them now , since the legal status of the immigrants has not changed , their argument goes			1
in some states , a work visa could be enough to establish legal presence and receive a driver 's license , said @entity139 , vice president of the @entity140			1
the topic has been coming up for many state officials , he said			0
" they 're definitely talking about it			0
the consensus is that well , we have our rules of who 's eligible for a license , " he said			0
" at the end of the day , it 's a state - issued document , and the state has the authority to determine who is eligible for that document			0
" but in every state , the statutes determining those rules are different			0
" it 's too early to qualify or really predict what the impact may or may not be , " he said			0
even in some states that have passed strong anti-illegal immigration laws , such as @entity167 , driver 's licenses may be available to undocumented immigrants who qualify under the new policy			1
under current @entity167 law , people with deferred status can get a license , and that 's what the state will do unless it gets different orders , said @entity178 , spokeswoman for the state 's @entity179			1
" we 're waiting for direction , " she said			0
the situation could be even more complicated when it comes to university tuition			0
policies in different states vary , from barring undocumented immigrants from enrolling at all , to granting them in - state tuition			2
in @entity167 , the tuition rules are not mandated by law , but by university regents , said @entity193 , an immigration attorney in @entity194			0
once these new young immigrants are able to get @entity198 numbers and driver 's licenses , they may qualify for more benefits , he said			1
5 things to know about the big change in immigration policy states such as @entity8 can not discriminate against the new deferred action holders , and will eventually have to relent , @entity193 argued			1
immigration lawyers are aware of the driver 's license issue , but are more focused right now on helping immigrants apply to the deferred action program , said @entity212 , former president of the @entity213			1
" once applicants are approved , we will then as a group turn our attention to how to resolve this problem , " the @entity215 - based immigration attorney said			0
" our concern ( now ) is not can you get a driver 's license			1
our concern is how can we get you qualified to get a work permit			0
" but battle lines are already being drawn in the latest war between the states and the federal government on immigration legislation , said @entity37 of the @entity39			0
" states that have chosen to be welcoming towards immigrants will embrace this program through their state policies , and states that have been somewhat restrictive toward immigration and immigrants will see this as a new occasion to restrict state benefits from these programs , " he said			1
@entity26 @entity244 spokesman @entity243 said that the agency " does n't comment on state specific matters			0
" faces of hope line up for two more years in the @entity26 but he noted , in a written statement , that the department 's deferred action program " is only a temporary measure			2
" " @entity255 must still act to provide a permanent solution to fix the broken immigration system , " he said			0
" until @entity255 acts , @entity244 is dedicated to implementing smart , effective reforms to the immigration system that allow it to focus its resources on common sense enforcement priorities , including criminals and other public safety threats			0
" in her executive order last week , @entity7 said giving deferred action recipients " improper access " to state and local benefits would " have significant and lasting impacts on the @entity8 budget , its health care system and additional public benefits that @entity8 taxpayers fund			1
" critics have slammed the @entity8 governor 's approach			1
" @entity7 is distorting federal law and inaccurately interpreting state law , " @entity277 , executive director of the @entity278 of @entity8 , said in a statement			2
" this order conflicts with state and federal law , because people who are granted deferred action will , in fact , have authorized presence in the @entity26			1
" governors in @entity8 , @entity54 and @entity55 are " shooting their economies right in the foot , " said @entity289 , executive director of the @entity290			2
" if this political grandstanding is successful , what will happen is that job creators wo n't be able to drive to the small business they want to start , and this new class of taxpayers will be kept from contributing to their states , " said @entity289			2
" at the state level , we 're going to watch this very closely			0
" @entity37 , of the @entity39 , said the battle could end up in the halls of state legislatures -- or at the @entity26 @entity309			0
@entity309 blocks provisions in immigration laws , lets some controversial ones stand			0
