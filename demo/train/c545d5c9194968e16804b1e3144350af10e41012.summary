-- esteemed psychiatrist @entity1 spent much of her career working with terminally ill patients and the anxiety many of them expressed in the face of their impending death			1
her experience and interactions with hundreds of them formed the basis for " @entity14 , " a groundbreaking 1969 book			0
in it , she outlined the five stages she believed those nearing death endured — denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and , lastly , acceptance — and suggested strategies for helping them and their families cope			1
her work was monumental within the field in part because the emotional needs of those dealing with death had for so long been avoided			2
it would not be for much longer			0
which is perhaps what makes @entity36 gov. @entity35 's hijacking of @entity1 ' grief cycle for his own gains so egregious			1
as he faced the press in an unending press conference held thursday after a scandal that jammed traffic on the @entity44 for four days blew up on his administration , @entity35 issued a series of halfhearted mea culpas			1
he asked not for the public 's forgiveness but for pity			1
" you can only imagine as i was standing there in my bedroom looking at my @entity55 how sad and betrayed i felt , " he said			0
" i 'm heartbroken about it and i 'm incredibly disappointed			0
i do n't think i 've gotten to the anger stage yet , but i 'm sure i 'll get there			0
" in his telling , he , too , after all , was a victim , just like the thousands of commuters — including schoolchildren -- who endured hours trapped in their cars somewhere between @entity64 and @entity36			2
just like 91 - year - old @entity65 , who died after paramedics who were stuck in traffic reached her			1
( @entity35 , while expressing regret , could not help but note , " i 've also heard conflicting reports about the cause of death			1
" ) in fact , at his new conference , he characterized himself as " heartbroken , " " sad , " " humiliated , " " betrayed ; " referring again and again to the stages of grief he was struggling through			1
oh , and did he mention he was " very sad ? " " @entity14 " had a profound impact on psychology and society			0
it led to a greater emphasis on counseling and hospice care for dying patients and their families , and inspired @entity1 to devote the remainder of her years in clinical practice to the dying , including @entity90 patients and children in particular			1
in subsequent years , of course , @entity14 ' grief cycle has been applied to countless other traumatic situations , including losing a job , going bankrupt and ending a relationship , all of which can carry fair amounts of grief and require coping			2
but this may be the first time her work has been used as a political strategy			0
the situation that forced @entity35 to an accounting before the cameras was traumatic , but not for him			1
despite his claims , he was n't actually a victim			2
nor was he convincingly contrite about either the cause or the effect of the actions that occurred at the behest of the staffers in his administration and on his watch , as he piled most of the blame on his deputy chief of staff , @entity119 ( he described her as " stupid " )			0
nowhere among @entity1 ' stages , it should be noted , is " seek sympathy , " " blame others , " or " do whatever it takes to clear your name			1
" in fact , if the governor is looking for some more situation - appropriate stages to pass through , he might consider turning to his @entity131 upbringing for a guide			2
among the church 's steps to a good confession : be truly sorry			0
express sorrow for the sin			0
resolve not to commit it again			0
lastly , ask for forgiveness			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			2

@entity1 first named 5 grief stages to help with death , says @entity144
she says @entity35 's casting himself as victim , *invoking* grief stages over scandal , is a first
@entity144 : he spoke of own humiliation , sadness . left out those affected by traffic tie - up
@entity144 : " seek sympathy , " " blame others " are not stages , but " ask forgiveness " works
