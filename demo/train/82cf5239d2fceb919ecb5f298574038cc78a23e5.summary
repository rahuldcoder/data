a woman 's chances of becoming pregnant are the same after rape as they are after consensual sex , according to medical experts and published studies			1
their conclusion contradicts a statement made last weekend by rep. @entity9 , @entity10 , who suggested in an interview with @entity13 affiliate @entity12 that rape rarely results in pregnancy			1
" from what i understand from doctors , that 's really rare , " said the @entity16 candidate in response to a question about whether abortion should be legal in cases of rape			1
" if it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down			1
" @entity9 defies mounting calls to withdraw from @entity16 race @entity9 's supporters say he was given misinformation that appears to stem from a 1999 article by dr. @entity33 , the former president of the @entity34			1
@entity33 wrote that rape pregnancies are " extremely rare " and that the stress of rape helps prevent pregnancy			1
" to get and stay pregnant a woman 's body must produce a very sophisticated mix of hormones , " @entity33 wrote in a 1999 article published in " @entity40 , " an anti-abortion newsletter			1
" hormone production is controlled by a part of the brain that is easily influenced by emotions			0
there 's no greater emotional trauma that can be experienced by a woman than an assault rape			2
this can radically upset her possibility of ovulation , fertilization , implantation and even nurturing of a pregnancy			0
" @entity33 , who is in his late 80s and lives in @entity61 , did not return a call from @entity13			0
but scientific data support neither @entity65 's assertion nor @entity9 's statements , according to experts			1
" what we know is that chronic stress can decrease fertility , " said dr. @entity68 , a fellow at the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) and professor in the @entity71 at the @entity72 , in a telephone interview with @entity13			1
@entity78 cites emotional , medical or nutritional stress as forms of chronic stress			1
" the acute stress does not have the same impact , " she added , referring to the act of rape			1
a 1996 study published in the @entity87 estimated 32,101 pregnancies in the @entity89 each year result from rape			2
opinion : rape can make you pregnant			2
generally , a single act of a rape has about a 5 % chance of resulting in pregnancy among victims aged 12 to 45 who are not on birth control , according to @entity69 figures			2
but experts say that percentage fluctuates greatly , depending on a woman 's ovulation cycle at the time of intercourse			2
three days prior to ovulation , a woman has a 15 % chance of pregnancy after a sexual encounter ; one to two days prior to ovulation , the odds double to 30 % ; they plummet to 12 % on the day of ovulation , @entity78 said			0
" since a rape would likely happen at any point in the cycle , the overall risk -- without considering day of cycle -- would be close to a 16 % chance of occurring on a fertile day and then there is , at maximum , a 30 % chance of conception , " @entity78 said			2
while the stress associated with rape may not lower a victim 's risk of becoming pregnant , rapists often do not ejaculate , thereby decreasing their victims ' risk of pregnancy , said @entity78			1
@entity9 has apologized for his remarks			2
" i had heard one time a medical report that it 's hard to get , it 's harder for somebody to get pregnant under those conditions , " he told radio host @entity132 on monday			2
" i do n't believe that 's true now			0
in fact , i 've checked the facts and that 's wrong			0
i was just wrong in that statement			0
" @entity9 asks for ' forgiveness ' in new tv ad dr. @entity146 , a clinical professor in the @entity71 at the @entity147 , said he was shocked when he heard @entity9 's original remarks			1
" that 's part of the broad theme here of misogyny -- that women are responsible for being raped ; they brought it on themselves through their provocative behavior or clothing , " @entity146 told " @entity156 " on tuesday night			0
" then , on top of that , should they be raped -- and if they get pregnant -- that , too , is their fault			0
it 's a double whammy			0
it 's cruel beyond words			0
" @entity146 rejected the authority of @entity33 , a general practitioner , to make such statements			0
" he has no scientific credentials , " said @entity146 , who serves on the editorial boards of several publications , including @entity168 and the journal contraception			0
" in medicine , opinions count only to the extent that they 're borne out or supported by evidence			0
no evidence at all supports dr. @entity33 's bizarre theories			0
" opinion : wake up -- it 's not just @entity9 surviving sexual assault : share your testimony on @entity185 .			1

" if it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down , " @entity9 says
experts *dispute* the @entity195 @entity16 candidate 's view
chronic stress can decrease fertility , but not the acute stress of rape , says professor
