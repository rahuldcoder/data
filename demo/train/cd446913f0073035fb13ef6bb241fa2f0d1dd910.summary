-- the world will feign outrage over the " revelations " cited in the newly released @entity5 's torture report			1
around dinner tables and coffee shops in the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , people are probably chuckling over the hype surrounding @entity14 interrogation techniques such as sleep deprivation , loud music , and yes , waterboarding			1
and what do their own governments use ? most likely beatings , mutilations and executions			0
the report findings may result in protests , but the most damaging consequence may be that it would set back our intelligence services in fighting terrorism			1
those captured on the battlefields of @entity31 and @entity32 were surprised when the treatment they received by their @entity14 captors was nothing like what they were told by their leaders			1
they were told they would be brutally tortured and killed regardless of whether they shared information			0
but they quickly learned that was n't the case			0
the mistakes at @entity49 in 2003 by unsupervised night - shift wannabe interrogators mirroring what they thought professionals were doing were wrong , and led to the end of the careers of those involved			2
the good thing that came out of @entity49 was that despite what @entity14 thought of the @entity14 military , those in @entity31 knew the @entity14 military would bend over backwards to demonstrate fair treatment			2
over time , those who were released told their leaders and @entity14 captors they would rather be detained by the @entity14 than by their own governments			2
our humane treatment of prisoners resulted in insurgent and terrorist manuals instructing fighters to wait out @entity14 detention and that eventually they would be released much like @entity72 leader @entity71 , who was released in 2004 from @entity73 , @entity31			2
detainees deemed of high value were sent to @entity76			0
after reforms following the abuses at @entity49 they could play chess and backgammon while drinking tea and watching tv via satellite			0
at the height of the sectarian fighting in @entity89 in 2006 , @entity85 insurgents and @entity86 took the fight to @entity92 militias			2
@entity86 leaders were able to mobilize fighters assuring frightened @entity85 that @entity14 forces would protect their neighborhoods from @entity92 militias			2
what ? yes , even @entity86 leaders knew the @entity14 -- while an adversary -- was not the monster they said it was and would do all it could to protect @entity85 areas from @entity92 militias , and unknowingly freeing up terrorists to go on the offensive			1
feigning outrage is being used as a tactic to shift @entity14 public support away from intelligence agencies and law enforcement in order to constrain them in the fight against terrorism			1
would the easily offended @entity14 public condemn those who did everything they could to protect them post 9/11 ? sending terrorists back to their own intelligence and security agencies for interrogation or rendition works mainly because they speak the language and know how to use culture and the @entity126 to deconstruct arguments			1
they may know the tribe and family relations and use that information to exert pressure to denounce terrorism			0
and yes , they have more leeway to use interrogation techniques			0
the fear of the known and unknown in rendition can lead to a detainee providing actionable intelligence before employing any tactic and often negates the use of interrogation tactics			0
the report states that enhanced interrogation tactics did not provide actionable intelligence -- i have to disagree			2
while some intelligence can be obtained without using these techniques , " ticking time bomb " intel can not be obtained without them			0
the @entity152 administration is retaining the right to use enhanced interrogation techniques in " ticking time - bomb " scenarios			0
the simple threat of sending a terrorist back to his country of origin was often enough to get him to give up information just to stay in @entity14 custody where he knew he would be treated humanely			1
he may even have been able to tell someone to " wake up and pay attention " like @entity168 did during a lecture to @entity14 intelligence agencies on terrorism			1
we are making it too easy for terrorists and their supporters to exploit our media and public over this report , which claims that no actionable intelligence came from these enhanced interrogation techniques			1
for example , did @entity5 intelligence staffers interview @entity168 ? the @entity14 intelligence community were able to gleam valuable and previously unknown information on @entity86 operations and its key leaders from him			1
the one advantage interrogators have is the " fear of the unknown			0
" this is often enough to get actionable intelligence from a detainee within the first 24 hours			0
the new report takes that away -- there is no fear of the " known			0
" in other words , the @entity14 will not do anything to you , you 'll be fine and there 's no need to give out any information ... and if your food is cold , call sen. @entity203 .			1

@entity205 : the world will feign outrage over " revelations " in the new torture report
@entity211 : the most damaging result may be that the report 's findings would set us back
he says @entity14 intelligence agencies fighting terrorism need our support
@entity211 : terrorists may *cooperate* less with interrogators if agencies are constrained
