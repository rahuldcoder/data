when @entity1 speaks of young women being abused in the music industry , she speaks from experience			1
during an interview with @entity7 on his radio show tuesday , the singer recalled being sexually harassed and assaulted when she was coming up in the music industry			1
@entity1 said that most of the men she 's worked with in the studio had been inappropriate at one time or another , barring exceptions like producer @entity15 , who worked with @entity1 on her debut album " @entity17 , " and singer @entity19 , with whom she 's collaborated			1
" that 's why that album was successful , because i was able to write some music that was n't made while i had the fear of @entity24 in me , pulling my skirt down in a studio because men were shoving their hands up my dress , " @entity1 told @entity7			1
it 's " still bad now			2
think about all those young girls that are 16 in @entity34 , ( or ) 19 , going , ' i met this record producer and he 's going to make me a star , he said he worked with @entity37			2
' ... it 's all a big lie			2
" when @entity7 pointedly asked @entity1 if she was raped by a record producer , the singer replied that she 's gone through " some horrific things			1
" " i 'm able to laugh now , because i 've gone through a lot of mental and physical therapy to heal over the years , " @entity1 said			1
" my music 's been wonderful for me			2
but i was a shell of my former self at one point			2
to be fair , i was about 19 , so ... i went to catholic school and all this crazy stuff happened , and i was going , ' oh , is this just the way adults are ? ' i was very naive			0
" @entity1 spews forth : this is no act afterward , it took the singer years to acknowledge what happened			1
" it did n't affect me as much right after as it did about four or five years later			0
it hit me so hard			0
i was so traumatized by it , i was like : ' just keep going , ' " she said			0
" i was n't even willing to admit that anything had even happened			0
... i did n't tell anybody			0
i did n't even tell myself for the longest time			0
and then i was like , you know what , all this drinking , and all this nonsense , you have to go to the source , otherwise it just wo n't go away			0
" @entity1 's admission came about after @entity7 brought up her performance of her song " @entity70 " at the @entity72 festival earlier this year			1
that performance , which included @entity1 being vomited on by artist @entity74 , was raked over the coals			1
some just did n't like it , but others accused @entity1 of promoting eating disorders			1
in actuality , that performance was an attempt to air out some long - held anger and pain , @entity1 said			1
the song " @entity70 " " is about rape , " she said			0
" the song is about demoralization			0
the song is about rage and fury and passion , and i had a lot of pain that i wanted to release			0
and i said to myself , ' i want to sing this song while i 'm ripping hard on a drumkit , and then i want to get on a mechanical bull -- which is probably one of the most demoralizing things you can put a female on in her underwear -- and i want this chick to throw up on me in front of the world , so that i can tell them , you know what ? you could never , ever degrade me as much as i could degrade myself , and look how beautiful it is when i do			0
