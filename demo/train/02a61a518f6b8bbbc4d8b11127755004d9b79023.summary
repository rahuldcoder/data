" if our party is not welcoming and inclusive , young people and increasingly other voters will continue to tune us out			0
" that was the @entity6 's own take on the 2012 election as it acknowledged in an autopsy report ( otherwise known as the @entity9 ) that it was failing to appeal to minority voters			1
unfortunately , too many @entity6 have already forgotten this lesson , a reality made all the clearer by the response to recent revelations that @entity16 majority whip @entity15 spoke to a white supremacist group 12 years ago			1
former house speaker @entity18 was just one of those who seemed more interested in making excuses than holding republicans to the standard they had supposedly set for themselves			0
appearing on @entity24 ' " @entity25 , " @entity23 brushed off the accusations , suggesting it was a " stupidly " scheduled meeting , while noting that president @entity28 attended the church of the racially divisive rev. @entity30 for 20 years			0
@entity23 also attempted to pivot to the media 's treatment of @entity33 with racist records			0
" you have ( sen. @entity36 who was the majority leader and a @entity38 leader			0
you have @entity39 , who was a justice , who was a @entity38 leader			0
but they were @entity33 and being in the @entity38 was ok , " @entity23 lectured			0
actually , none of that was ok			0
but this is n't about @entity33 -- it 's about the racist undercurrent that has been corrupting the @entity9 for decades , and the fact that the party 's establishment has too often looked the other way			1
unfortunately , it feels like every time a @entity6 is caught behaving like a racist in the 21st century , prominent members of the @entity9 try to change the subject to @entity33 behaving badly instead of denouncing what is going on			1
what exactly did @entity15 do to deserve the opprobrium that critics have justifiably heaped on him ? well , in 2002 , as a @entity59 state representative , @entity15 spoke to the @entity60 , founded by former @entity38 grand wizard @entity61			2
@entity15 alleges a staffer scheduled the appearance and that he was n't aware of the group 's , uh , " divisive racial and religious views , " as he wrote in a statement			1
yet @entity15 's claims of plausible deniability just do n't add up			1
for a start , the @entity70 reported that @entity72 , his neighbor at the time and a longtime @entity75 adviser , requested @entity15 speak to the group and said @entity15 " knew who i was , but i do n't think he held it against me			2
" but we do n't even need to look to someone else 's take to get a feel for @entity15 's past			1
in 1999 , @entity15 reportedly told @entity84 he shared @entity75 's " conservative " views but said that " the novelty of @entity61 has worn off			1
" more recently , in 2004 , @entity15 voted against declaring a state holiday honoring civil rights leader the rev. @entity89 collectively , these actions do n't look like those of an elected official who rejects " that kind of hateful bigotry , " as @entity15 noted in his statement , but instead suggest a man trying to play politics in a state where only 13 % of his congressional district 's residents are black			2
@entity23 also told " @entity25 " host @entity102 that @entity104 , the first black @entity6 woman elected to @entity105 , had said @entity15 has been " helpful " to her , as if this somehow negates what @entity15 has done			1
but is n't helping out a fellow member of the @entity9 a pretty basic requirement of the job for someone in a leadership position ? i admire @entity104 , but the truth is that as a black woman myself , i have no idea how she could say on @entity118 's " @entity117 " that she believes @entity15 " should remain in leadership , " particularly since @entity104 does n't appear to have had experience working directly with him			1
perhaps @entity104 was trying to show the @entity9 she 's a team player , but she did n't do herself or the party any favors by standing by a colleague who spoke to a group whose membership would no doubt be happy if segregation had never ended			2
@entity16 majority leader @entity127 said @entity15 made a " mistake			2
" speaker @entity130 , for his part , called it an " error of judgment " and added that @entity15 has his " full confidence			0
as a black @entity6 , i 'm tired of my party continuing to provide safe harbor to people like @entity15			1
@entity23 complained the media 's coverage of @entity15 's speech was " a one - sided view of reality			2
" actually , that sounds more like a description of the @entity9 today			0
the face of the party looks as intolerant as ever as 2015 begins			0
unless it starts showing " representatives " like @entity15 the door , it will find itself writing another autopsy report in 2016 .			0

@entity152 : @entity15 *scandal* a *reminder* of @entity9 's race problems
@entity6 efforts to change subject *misguided* , she says
