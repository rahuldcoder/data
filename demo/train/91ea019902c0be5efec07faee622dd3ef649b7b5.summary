tuesday is @entity0 in the @entity1 , and although the mostly state and local races wo n't stir the same passions as next year 's presidential contest , millions of people will cast ballots			1
they 'll do it in much the same way that @entity1 have for centuries : by showing up at a polling place and ticking off boxes for their candidates of choice			1
all of which raises the question : in an era when virtually every daily task can be done on the @entity21 , why ca n't we vote online , too ? the answer depends on whom you ask			1
advocates say the time is right to seriously consider letting voters cast a ballot from the comfort of their homes or even on the screens of their mobile phones			2
" we 've voted the way we have for the past 200 years because we could n't do any better than that , " said @entity33 , a former it professional at @entity35 who runs the blog @entity38 the vote			2
" now , we have this technology that has revolutionized the rest of our lives ... ( and ) can revolutionize our voting system and could revolutionize our political system			2
" a recipe for chaos ? but critics , many of them in the cybersecurity world , argue that letting people cast votes from their home computers is a recipe for chaos			1
" my position has n't changed over the years , " said @entity58 , a professor of computer science at @entity60 who specializes in computer security			2
" which is that online voting is a very unsafe idea and a very bad idea and something i think no technological breakthrough i can foresee can ever change			1
" @entity58 said that , in addition to politically motivated reasons for attempting to corrupt online votes , many hackers with no real political agenda could still see the challenge of tinkering with an election too attractive to pass up			2
" @entity77 's computers are not getting more secure , " @entity58 said			0
" they 're getting more infected with viruses			0
they 're getting more under the control of malware			0
" @entity83 and @entity84 other countries , though , have gone further down the road toward online voting than @entity1 election officials have			1
@entity83 has been near the forefront			0
in all , 80 @entity83 cities and towns have experimented with internet voting in municipal elections			0
the town of @entity95 , in @entity96 , has offered online ballots in local elections since 2003			0
an independent report by digital - strategy firm @entity101 showed that early voting increased 300 % the first year internet voting was allowed			1
twenty - five percent of the people who voted online in 2003 said they did n't vote in the prior local election , and overall turnout rose nearly 10 % from 2006 to 2010 , according to the report			1
" not only is @entity95 a perfect example of how internet voting is being successfully implemented in a binding election ; with other municipalities following suit , @entity83 is becoming a global leader in the implementation of internet voting , " the report read			0
@entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are among the countries that have tested internet voting			1
but when it comes to national elections , @entity84 is the clear leader			2
the tiny @entity124 nation ( its population of 1.3 million is roughly the size of @entity127 ) has allowed online voting for all of its citizens since 2007			1
in this year 's election , nearly one in four votes was cast online , according to its elections commission			0
risks and rewards @entity136 , an adviser to @entity84 's @entity137 , said security is of the utmost concern			1
" internet voting relies basically on a single factor : trust , " @entity136 said			0
" building and stabilizing this trust is the most important but also the most difficult task of the state			0
" in @entity84 , that security includes a national id card that can be used remotely and a voting system built to recognize unusual activity , @entity146 said			1
he said security officials have detected no serious attempts to tamper with the votes			0
but , in @entity58 's mind , that 's not enough			0
he says the @entity21 's known security risks alone could be enough to call an election 's results into question			1
" in any election , it 's important that the public perceive that the election is held fairly , " @entity58 said			0
" if you allow online voting and you 're unable to detect any fraud , but it turns out later that many computers were compromised ... there 's no way to audit or backtrack or recount or do anything to figure out what actually happened			1
" the real question is whether you 're interested in providing more questions about the outcome of an election or less			0
" @entity33 , who writes his blog from @entity177 , acknowledges the difficulties but says they should n't be enough to stop progress on internet voting -- which he and others believe will increase participation , particularly among younger voters			0
" if there are concerns about any of this , the answer is to further work on those concerns , not declare that the @entity21 is entirely dangerous and will always be entirely dangerous , and you can never trust it , " he said			2
he notes that trillions of dollars have been moved around via online banking and that functions as sensitive as air - traffic control take place on the @entity21			1
he also said that for critics to hold up the current @entity1 voting system as a model of safety is laughable			1
" machines , memory cards , even things on paper " can be manipulated , he said			0
" how many times in our history have we found a box of ballots in someone 's garage a couple of weeks after an election ? " experimental efforts experts do n't expect widespread voting by @entity21 to take hold in the @entity1 anytime soon			1
but there have been some fledgling efforts at testing it			0
in the early 2000s , the @entity1 military began testing the @entity221 , which would have let service members stationed overseas vote online			1
but it was scrapped by the @entity225 after its studies suggested security risks			2
as recently as last year , @entity228 experimented with allowing a small number of military members from five counties to vote online , although that pilot program was criticized by some security experts			2
@entity228 's secretary of state @entity234 has appeared to back away from pushing to make it statewide .			0

online voting has been tested worldwide but not much in the @entity1
security *analysts* say too many risks exist on the @entity21 to make voting practical
advocates argue banking , bill - *paying* are already common online
in @entity84 , people have voted online since 2007 with no known security breaches
