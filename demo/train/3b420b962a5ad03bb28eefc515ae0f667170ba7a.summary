-- the question means little to millions living in poverty with neither electricity nor electronics			0
but there are also millions now weaving the @entity6 ever more tightly into their social fabric -- witness the booming popularity of @entity10 and other social networking sites -- so the question seems worth asking			1
happiness can be found everywhere , including social networks and on blogs			1
enter the " @entity16 " in the @entity17 , which explores the relationship between the @entity6 ( in particular ) and happiness			1
though the final report has n't been released yet , the project 's global survey results and experiments suggest something that a lot of @entity10 users already sense : social interaction is a driver for happiness , and the @entity6 is a valid way to experience it			1
@entity30 , a writer and researcher involved with the project , says the @entity33 has become our " new global campfire , " the place where we gather to argue , laugh , talk , learn , love , turn strangers into friends , and to get a sense of belonging			1
" we are a social species and we need to interact in order to feel alive , " he says			1
as happiness research over the past half century or so has shown , belonging is a strong a predictor of happiness			1
psychology courses introduce students to @entity50 's " hierarchy of needs , " a pyramid diagram created by the @entity53 psychologist @entity52			0
the project suggests the pyramid 's middle levels of " love / belonging " and " esteem " can be met by services like blogs , @entity10 , @entity60 and other elements of @entity6 , like comments sections below news articles or @entity65 posts			1
but as with anything there are perils tempering the benefits of heavy internet usage			1
@entity30 warns the @entity33 can cause stress in users who do n't take control of the experience			0
" the attitude that they treat the medium with , " he says , " defines the happiness they experience			1
" people who feel they " rule the @entity6 " are happier than those who feel like " they are ruled by the @entity6 , " he says			1
" the first group sees the long tail as a brilliant place to cherry pick for the best results , and the second group immediately experiences stress because they ca n't look at all the results			0
" staying in control at this month 's @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity30 gave some light - hearted but probably sound advice for making sure you 're in control of your @entity33 life			2
among the tidbits dispensed : do n't take your @entity99 into the bedroom			0
accept that there is more information than you can possibly look at			0
human filters of information ( like your @entity60 network ) often beat machine filters ( like @entity109 )			0
know when to go online and when to go offline -- sometimes a face - to - face talk is needed			0
ignoring the latter is a possible sign of internet addiction , a growing problem in many parts of the world			2
at clinics like the @entity120 at @entity121 , patients ( especially online gamers ) are challenged to look at sacrificing some of the " high " they get out engaging in their addictive behavior ( a boost in self - esteem , a sense of belonging , an ability to forget about real - world problems ) because of the consequences of the negative aspects			1
these can include loss of personal relationships , conflict with family members , and the threat of job loss			1
of course it 's important to distinguish between addicts and healthy users , which make up the vast majority			0
" as far as people using networking sites such as @entity10 or @entity60 to derive happiness , that is not uncommon , " says @entity144 , a clinical coordinator at the clinic			2
" many people can use these sites for their intended purpose -- to remain in contact with people and / or to develop personal relationships			2
" but perhaps even healthy internet users get " addicted " -- and are aware of it -- to at least some degree			2
as part of a playful experiment , @entity30 , a blogger and @entity60 user with hundreds of followers , decided to spend the month of december completely offline , during which time he worked on his upcoming book " @entity165 " ( written in @entity17 )			1
feelings he experienced went from " phantom limb " strangeness in the first week to anger and regret in the second to peace of mind in the third			2
without the online distractions , he says , " i had tons of energy and have never been more productive than in that single week			0
" in the fourth week there was anticipation but also a sense of growing anxiety about losing that sense of quietness and ability to focus			0
life without the @entity33 , he decided after the experiment , was not for him			2
life without email , though , was a blessing			0
a lot of us , not just @entity30 , are wondering what it would be like to unplug for a while			0
that in itself is interesting			0
twenty years ago the idea that millions would be so absorbed in the @entity33 might have seemed unlikely and bizarre			0
a t - shirt of @entity30 's reading " the internet was closed so i thought i 'd come outside today " would n't have struck a chord the way it does now			0
and virtual happiness -- and unhappiness -- would n't have been considered real .			1
