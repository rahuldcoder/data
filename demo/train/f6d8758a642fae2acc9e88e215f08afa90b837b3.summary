-- we love the glamor of alpine skiing , the glow of tradition , the glitz of stars like @entity6 , and the gumption of her quest to race the men			1
but do we love it enough to keep watching when skiing 's " dark side " is so much more exciting and dangerous ? freestyle skiing is taking over the @entity17			1
a global passion for taking two skis to new extremes is reaching its zenith , and the @entity23 movement has responded by adding a succession of new events to its program			1
when slopestyle and ski halfpipe make their debut at the @entity32 , freestyle skiers will for the first time have as many medals to aim at as their alpine counterparts			1
and as fans are increasingly drawn to new , high - octane breeds of winter sport , so top athletes are making the switch too			1
in 2009 , @entity40 left behind alpine racing for ski cross			1
within two years she had become an @entity44 gold medalist and world champion			2
" ski cross is full of outcasts from alpine , " the @entity47 23 - year - old tells @entity0			1
" @entity50 is so strict on rules			2
ski cross is more relaxed , for free spirits or people looking for something more exciting than racing the clock			1
" ski cross , a thrilling four - way straight fight to the finish line , blew the socks off tv audiences on its debut at @entity62 , where @entity40 finished fifth overall			1
for some , it made the blue riband downhill races look almost pedestrian			2
@entity40 calls it the " dark side " of ski racing			1
" it 's so simple , " she says			2
" you do n't have to know anything about it , it 's obvious : whoever is leading is the best , right ? and if they make a mistake and get passed , you see why			1
you do n't have to understand , just watch and enjoy			2
" contrast that with alpine , where even experts can struggle to identify exactly how and why a race was won -- including @entity82			1
" i 've raced alpine but even i did n't understand everything , " she admits			1
" is that guy faster than the fastest split time ? or faster than the fastest racer in general ? it 's kind of like , ' i do n't know what 's going on			0
' " as president of the @entity92 , @entity90 has been watching alpine skiing for more than half a century			1
in that time , he has n't solved this problem			0
" it 's very difficult , even for a highly trained eye , to see how a race was won			0
sometimes you have five or six racers who finish within one second of each other			0
it 's a built - in problem , " says @entity90 , who helped to found alpine 's @entity102 circuit in the 1960s as the editor of @entity107 magazine			1
yet having witnessed the birth of freestyle skiing in the 1970s and its subsequent explosion , he believes freestyle could end up eating itself			1
is the proliferation of events making freestyle as hard to grasp for the novice as the intricacies of downhill ? " to me , there are too many @entity23 events , " he says			1
" they keep inventing more and more , and they 're all relatively minor			1
in your great classic sports such as golf and tennis , which i think are comparable to skiing , you have all this history			1
" commentators and writers can refer to golf 's masters champions , how @entity134 did , how @entity135 played , and how that compares to today			0
there 's great history there			0
" all these novelties , these new events , have very little history to them			2
" but @entity90 also thinks alpine skiing is missing vital chances to broaden its appeal in an era where younger generations , their attention spans waning by the second , are overwhelmed by choice			1
" a couple of years ago , when ( alpine superstars ) @entity6 and @entity154 were virtually tied for the season title , they refused to have a race - off which would have attracted a huge television audience , " he said			2
" they did n't let it happen ' because of a rule			0
' it 's the same thing now that @entity6 wants to race the men			0
they say : ' no , there 's a rule , women ca n't race			0
' " can you imagine the international tv audience they would attract with that race ? these opportunities are presented on a platter , but they do n't seem to happen			0
" for freestyle skiing 's fans , @entity174 is largely irrelevant			1
their home is the web , where anyone with the right moves and a camera can find a huge audience			0
meet the @entity184 brothers -- @entity185 and @entity186 , both 19 -- their friend @entity187 , 20 , and cameraman @entity187 , 18			0
they live in the town of @entity195 , in central @entity196 , and the internet loves them			0
" our latest episode has been viewed over half a million times , " @entity187 tells @entity0			0
" i did n't dare to dream we would get this popular			0
" the quartet spend their days and @entity195 's long , dark midwinter nights finding rails , walls and other beguiling items of street furniture in their hometown			2
what they find , they ski on			2
or over , or under , or through			0
they call it " urban skiing			2
" " we try to choose our spots so we are n't too close to people 's homes , " says @entity187			0
" the one time the police kicked us out was when we were filming about 200 meters from the local hospital , in between two roads			0
" dozens of dangerous takes might be needed to get each trick right , but it pays off : short compilations are uploaded to @entity228 and each one becomes a hit with thousands of @entity232 fans			0
there have , as yet , been no serious injuries			0
disciplines like slopestyle incorporate a lot of the same moves you will see @entity192 pulling off in their videos			2
as a sport , freestyle speaks to them far more than watching one skier after another race the clock down the same old slope -- @entity6 or no @entity248			2
" it would be boring to just ski down the slope , " says @entity184			2
" that 's why we like to do tricks			0
when we do tricks , the only limit is our imagination			0
but when we do alpine skiing , the limit is the 100m - high slope we have			1
" @entity187 adds : " the only skiing you see on television is pretty much alpine stuff , and that 's boring to my eyes			1
" @entity265 is a wildly rising sport			0
our local ski hill is full of young kids on their new twin tips ( double - ended freestyle skis )			1
that 's one reason our videos have become popular			0
freeskiing is a lot different from alpine , the videos are a much bigger part of the sport			2
" freestyle skiing now enticingly combines a young , passionate fanbase , avidly consuming the sport through the web , with a raft of @entity23 disciplines which are guaranteed mainstream airtime next year			1
but if alpine racing 's position on top of the pile is ever to be truly threatened , freestyle needs to match alpine 's impressive presence on worldwide tv , which remains the kingmaker of sports even this far into the @entity296			1
for example , @entity23 downhill champion @entity6 ( televised ) has more than 150,000 @entity300 followers ; ski cross world champion @entity82 ( streamed ) has 650			2
that makes @entity304 2014 an unparalleled opportunity which freestyle athletes know they must take			1
" @entity50 will always be strong , it has its roots set pretty deep , " admits @entity40			1
" but we 're going to get more followers from a younger crowd			0
we race at the @entity44 and that crowd , those kinds of kids will be watching it when they grow up			0
" right now we 're battling most with exposure			0
i believe we have only three or four races broadcast in @entity47 this year , and last year we had none , not even a race that was held in @entity47			0
for us to get big , we need that tv time			0
" once people see freestyle skiing , they 'll really get into it			1
we wo n't have to do anything different from what we 're doing right now to get people to follow it			0

a pair of freestyle skiing events to be introduced at 2014 @entity17
the " dark arts " of slopestyle and ski halfpipe will make their debut at @entity304
several athletes are making switch from alpine *competitions* , including @entity40
some experts say there are too many " minor " freestyle events included at @entity32
