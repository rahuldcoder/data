-- @entity1 may have faded from the headlines in the @entity3 , but the threat -- to @entity5 and the rest of the world -- remains			1
this month , the @entity8 held a hearing on @entity1 , including testimony by dr. @entity11 , director of the @entity12			0
he noted that the @entity12 had lowered its estimate of the number of cases likely to emerge in @entity5			0
despite this positive news , @entity1 remains largely out of control in @entity19			1
the @entity20 announced this month that @entity21 is " relatively stable , " but the recent spread of the virus into @entity24 only confirms the need for a greater sustained effort to combat @entity1 at its origin			1
that 's why many experts are cautioning that declaring the emergency over is premature			0
and it 's why the @entity33 administration and key members of @entity35 are requesting $ 6.1 billion to beef up our ability to eradicate @entity1 and prepare for future epidemics			1
there are two reasons why this emergency is far from over			0
first , as long as @entity1 rages in @entity5 , health care systems in the @entity3 and elsewhere will need to remain on high alert			1
there is no way to assure that @entity1 -- or other known and unknown biological threats -- will be contained without the ability on a global scale to identify , manage , eradicate or even prevent these diseases from spreading			0
improving our capacity to develop vaccines , respond to crises overseas and develop other countermeasures for dangerous viruses are vital			0
second , the death from @entity1 of @entity58 in @entity59 was a powerful illustration of how unprepared we are to deal with large - scale biological threats			2
few of the almost 5,000 hospitals in the @entity3 are at the level of @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66 in @entity67 , the @entity68 or the handful of other facilities that have been designated as ready to handle @entity1 - like illnesses			1
why are n't we ready ? part of the problem is that budget cuts over the last decade have slashed the federally funded @entity75 and special disaster funding for public health agencies			1
indeed , since 2008 , some 50,000 public health positions have been eliminated due to funding cuts			0
for many public health agencies , even getting routine work done , never mind responding to crises , is proving a challenge for many communities in the @entity3			0
the emergency funds being sought to respond to @entity1 here and in @entity5 are critical to helping protect the @entity3 public			2
the recent @entity3 experience of @entity1 was a wake - up call			2
but if the country hits the snooze button once the media coverage fades , we 'll have missed a critical moment to deal not just with this deadly illness , but with future disasters , too .			2

@entity98 : *ebola* headlines in @entity3 may have receded , but it 's *mistake* to think threat gone
he says @entity1 is out of control in @entity19 and has spread to @entity24
@entity98 says @entity3 hospitals remain *woefully* unprepared for potential *resurgence*
budget cuts have hit key preparedness *programs* , but we ca n't hit snooze button , he says
