-- @entity1 released the names of more than 1 million people who signed a recall petition against gov. @entity5 , state officials said , despite safety concerns among petition signers			1
" in the interest of full transparency , the board has always planned to release copies of recall petitions to anyone who requested them and to post them online , " said @entity9 , director and general counsel			2

the documents are posted on the board 's website as pdfs			0
" weighing all of these concerns and public interests , we have concluded that the balancing test of the @entity27 favors disclosure of the entire recall petition without redaction of information on a recall petition ... " the board 's statement said , noting the public and officeholders have the right to view the petitions			1
" few processes in the electoral system or elsewhere are more public than the signing of recall petitions against state elected officials			2
" before the decision , @entity1 attorney general @entity57 , a @entity58 like @entity5 , said the signatures should be made public , stating the importance of transparency in the recall process			1
" our law i think is very clear that the maximum amount of information that is available should be made available , " he said			0
" it 's general knowledge that if you do something in public , that 's going to be public information			2
" this would be the first time in @entity1 's history that a governor has faced recall			1
crowd celebrates end of the recall effort in @entity81 in fact , there have only been two successful gubernatorial recalls in @entity30 history , that of @entity88 gov. @entity87 in 2003 and that of @entity91 gov. @entity90 in 1921			2
the more difficult battle will begin once the signatures are approved , and the state schedules a recall election			0
both sides will be well financed and ready to battle , said @entity97 , president of the @entity98			0
@entity5 was undaunted by the recall effort , @entity0 affiliate @entity99 reported			1
" the optimist in me looks at that and says : the overwhelming majority of the people in the state chose not to sign that and i earned the trust of the majority the last time			0
my hope is i will earn their trust again , " he said			0
@entity5 set off a firestorm in january 2010 when he moved to curtail the collective bargaining rights of most state employees			2
with majorities in both houses of the @entity119 , @entity5 and his @entity58 allies voted to limit raises for public employees except police and firefighters to the rate of inflation , bar unions from deducting dues from workers ' paychecks and force them to hold a new certification vote every year			1
that bill was signed into law in march , following weeks of protests at the state capitol building in @entity81			0
republicans insisted it was necessary to control the skyrocketing costs of public employee benefits and close the budget shortfall			0
democrats argued it was an attempt to gut public - sector labor unions , one of their core constituencies			1
the public brouhaha all but shut down the @entity1 state legislature for weeks			1
it also drew protesters by the tens of thousands , among them union supporters and public employees , who called the measure an attack on workers			0
a group of @entity158 lawmakers left the state for some time in an effort to not allow a quorum for a vote			0
