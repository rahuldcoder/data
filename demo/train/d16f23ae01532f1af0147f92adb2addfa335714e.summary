@entity0 , @entity1 -- after two years of traveling around the country and criticizing president @entity5 , president - elect @entity3 said friday that he " always thought [ @entity5 ] was a good guy			1
" @entity3 tells @entity2 's @entity6 that it was " tough " for him to request the additional bailout funds			1
" i mean , i think personally he is a good man who loves his family and loves his country , " @entity3 said in an exclusive interview with @entity2 's @entity6			2
during the election season , @entity3 frequently campaigned against what he called @entity5 's " failed policies " and promised a " clean break " from the past eight years			1
asked if there was anything he wanted to take back , now that he has spent more time with the president , @entity3 praised @entity5 's team for helping with a smooth transition and said part of what @entity23 is about is being able to have " disagreements politically and yet treat each other civilly			1
" @entity3 also said he thought @entity5 made " the best decisions that he could at times under some very difficult circumstances			1
" " that does not detract from my assessment that over the last several years , we have made a series of bad choices and we are now going to be inheriting the consequences of a lot of those bad choices , " @entity3 said			2
in addition to his relationship with @entity5 , @entity3 also discussed some key issues that he will face in the first days of his administration , including national security and the economy			2
even before taking the oath of office , @entity3 has already faced a showdown with @entity48 over releasing what remains of the $ 700 bailout bill that @entity5 and @entity48 authorized before the election			1
the $ 350 billion that the @entity52 approved will come with specific conditions , @entity3 said			2
" there 's nothing wrong with us placing some conditions , making sure that the money 's not going to executive compensation , making sure you 're not seeing big dividend payoffs to shareholders and making sure that money is being left so that we can get credit flowing again , not just for individual homeowners who are losing their homes , but also small businesses who are the lifeblood of this economy			0
" if they ca n't get credit , then they end up having to shutter their doors			0
and when they shutter their doors , people lose jobs			0
they then ca n't pay their mortgage , and you start down the road that we 're on			0
we want to reverse that path , and that means that 's the way we use the next $ 350 billion that @entity48 voted on , and that was a very tough vote for a lot of people			0
and it was tough for me to have to request it , " he said			0
