a leader of @entity2 rebels in eastern @entity5 's @entity4 region said friday he is not interested in a truce with the @entity5 government in @entity9 because his troops are on the offensive			1
" since we 're attacking , there is no sense to have peace talks now , " @entity12 , leader of the self - proclaimed @entity13 of @entity4 , said in a meeting with university students , according to his media office			1
" we 've made this mistake before			0
it 's not decent to repeat it , " he said			0
thousands have been killed in months of conflict between the rebels and @entity5 troops , and a ceasefire agreed to in september crumbled long ago			1
@entity12 's comments came two days after the foreign ministers of @entity5 and @entity31 met in @entity32 to discuss a way out of the violence			1
but @entity12 showed no interest in the talks			2
" there will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire , " he said , reported @entity31 state news agency @entity37			0
" we will be on the offensive until we reach the border of @entity4 region			1
" he said that he was interested in cooperating with @entity5 on prisoner exchanges			1
" we need to get our guys who 've been captured , " he said , according to @entity37			0
despite the talks in @entity32 , violence in the breakaway @entity4 and @entity48 regions in eastern @entity5 shows no signs of abating			1
power is out in and around @entity48 after militants shelled a power plant there , @entity48 regional official @entity57 told @entity5 's state - run @entity59 news agency			1
@entity57 noted that the local water supply and boilers are off , and trolley buses are n't operating			0
thursday 's shelling of a transit stop in @entity65 -- an attack that @entity5 's @entity67 blamed on rebels -- killed eight civilians , according to state news reports			1
but @entity5 troops have come under heavy fire , as well			2
that includes 115 attacks in a recent 24 - hour period that killed three troops and wounded 50 more , @entity59 reported friday			0
the news agency said that " @entity31 - terrorist troops " faced off with @entity5 soldiers thursday along @entity86 , even posting a picture that showed a man with stripes on his clothing , suggesting that he was part of the @entity31 military			2
this is in line with @entity9 's repeated assertions that @entity31 has not only actively supported rebels with arms , but has sent its own troops across the border to battle @entity5 forces			1
on wednesday , for instance , @entity5 president @entity95 said that " more than 9,000 @entity31 troops ( crossed ) our @entity31 - @entity5 border , bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks , armed personnel carriers , and killing @entity5 civilians and attacking @entity5 troops			2
" claims that @entity31 forces entered @entity5 ' complete rubbish , ' @entity31 says @entity31 foreign minister @entity106 promptly responded to this assertion with a firm denial , much like other denials made by @entity31 officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention			2
" as to the flow of troops and armaments , this is not the first time we hear something like that , " he said			0
" and each time i hear that , i say if you 're so confident about that , please present us with facts , but no one has been able to provide us with these facts			0
" @entity31 forces , equipment enter @entity5 , @entity127 says pro-russian separatists have claimed control of parts of eastern @entity5 since the spring of 2014 , despite a push by @entity5 forces to defeat them			1
from mid-april to january 21 , the conflict had killed at least 5,086 people and injured at least 10,948 others , said the @entity139			0
" we fear that the real figure may be considerably higher , " the @entity140 said about the death toll in a report released friday			0
at least 262 people were killed in the fighting from january 13 through wednesday alone , the report said			0
unrest in @entity5 began with protests in the country 's capital last year after president @entity151 , favoring closer ties to @entity31 , dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the @entity155			2
after months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in @entity9 , @entity156 ousted @entity151 in february			0
weeks later , @entity31 annexed the @entity161			0
then in april , violence broke out in two @entity5 regions that border @entity31 -- @entity4 and @entity48 -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in @entity9 .			1
