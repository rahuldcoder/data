-- the politics of oil and ecology have put president @entity4 between a rock and hard place , as he faces a decision on whether or not to permit construction of a new pipeline			1
the squeeze just got tighter with a new , negative environmental assessment			2
the @entity16 will give @entity17 energy independence , thousands of jobs , important industrial infrastructure and wo n't cost taxpayers a dime , say proponents			2
many of them are @entity22 lawmakers			2
it is dangerous , inherently filthy and must be stopped , say opponents , some of whom are @entity27 who helped get the president elected			2
on monday , the @entity30 weighed in on the side of the environmentalists , weeks after the @entity33 came down on the side of the proponents			1
the @entity30 sent a letter to high officials at @entity38 , blasting the draft @entity40 ( @entity40 ) it published in march that had reflected positively on the pipeline project			1
the environmental agency rated the @entity40 as @entity43 - 2			0
it stands for " environmental objections - insufficient information			0
" that could be seen as a c - on the @entity30 's grading scale			1
president @entity4 has promised to decide soon on whether or not to allow the @entity49 oil company to lay the 835 mile long @entity16 from @entity50 , @entity51 , to @entity52 , @entity53			1
while he has contemplated the pros and cons , powerful political forces have aligned on both sides of the argument			1
@entity60 spill strengthens arguments of @entity16 foes economic pros the @entity16 would pump 830,000 barrels of oil sands crude per day through @entity17 's heartland , connecting crude producers in @entity51 with refineries and shipping companies in the @entity17			2
@entity49 would cover all the costs , proponents argue , making it practically a gift to the @entity17 oil infrastructure			0
on its way to @entity53 , where it would connect with other , already existing pipelines , @entity16 would pick up additional oil produced in @entity77 and @entity78 and stream it south , @entity49 said on its website			0
it would reduce " @entity17 dependence on oil from @entity82 and the @entity83 by up to 40 percent , " @entity49 extols			0
dirty air it will produce too many greenhouse gases , the @entity30 said in its letter , and this needs to be amended , before the project goes forward			1
the @entity51 crude in its raw form is mixed with sand			0
extracting the oil and transporting it requires more energy than pumping crude out of a well			0
thrusting it through long pipes increases the energy consumption			0
that higher energy use leads to greater greenhouse gas emissions , an increase of " 18.7 million metric tons ( 20 million tons ) c02 ... per year when compared to an equal amount of @entity17 average crudes , " the @entity30 said			1
the state department 's assessment concludes that just as much @entity51 oil will make it to market , by train if necessary , if no pipeline is built , therefore there would be little additional ecological impact			1
the @entity30 argued that " while informative " that train of thought is out of date			1
in november : protestors call on @entity4 to reject @entity16 pipeline nasty spills the agency is also concerned about oil spills , particularly since sands crude is different from conventional crude			2
it cites a 2010 pipe break in @entity125 , which spurted out 20,000 barrels of sands crude			0
some of it sank to the bottom of the @entity129 and could not be completely cleaned up in three years ' time , the @entity30 said			1
" spills of diluted bitumen may require different response actions or equipment , " the letter stated			0
" these spills can also have different impacts than spills of conventional oil			0
" the state department assessment did not address these issues and needs to require @entity49 to do more to monitor for oil leaks into ground water , the @entity30 criticized			1
bitumen is the tar - like oil extracted from the sand			0
it is thinned with chemicals , so it can be pumped through pipelines			0
@entity53 beauty @entity151 's assessment represents its second go - round with the @entity51 company			1
it rejected a permit from @entity49 , last year , saying the route through @entity53 was too risky for the state 's @entity157 , a landscape of natural beauty			2
and it endangered the @entity162 , which provides water to farmers and ranchers to raise livestock and grow crops			0
@entity49 came up with a new route , but the @entity30 said , it misses the mark			1
" the alternative route in @entity53 has avoided most of the impacts to the @entity157 , but still crosses the @entity162 , " the agency assessed			0
in its public reaction monday , @entity151 indicated that the @entity30 's criticism was business as usual			1
it also anticipated public protest			0
" the @entity33 has always anticipated that in preparing a @entity178 it would conduct additional analysis and incorporate public comments received on the @entity181 , " said press spokesman @entity177			1
the politics @entity16 opponents have aligned themselves principally behind the greenhouse gas ( @entity185 ) issue , as the @entity30 acknowledged in monday 's letter to @entity151 : " it is this difference in @entity185 intensity - between oil sands and other crudes - that is a major focus of the public debate about the climate impacts of oil sands crude			1
" @entity4 's own former deputy press secretary is leading the charge to push the president to stop the pipeline			1
@entity201 quit his job before the 2012 election to head up the super @entity204 , which worked for the president 's reelection			1
in january , he joined the pr firm @entity207 as an executive vice president			2
he is now representing a new coalition , " @entity210 , no reward , " which opposes @entity16			0
it goes after the additional greenhouse gases but also showcases the damage causes by spills to @entity17 in the heartland			0
another group , 350.org , which wants to bring down carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere below 350 parts per million , is soliciting letters of protest to the state department			0
@entity53 's @entity22 governor @entity223 has approved the project , and @entity53 congressman @entity225 has called for the @entity16 's construction in a @entity22 radio address			1
the pipeline " is primed to give our economy a shot in the arm and make energy more affordable -- and it wo n't cost the taxpayers a dime , " he argued			2
@entity225 spoke a day after an apparent pipeline rupture in the @entity60 town of @entity238 in late march , about 20 miles north of @entity239			2
black torrents of diluted bitumen flowed through the community , forcing the evacuation of 22 homes .			0

the @entity33 delivered an assessment positive of the proposed pipeline
the @entity30 gives it a poor grade , says the ecological risks are too high
political forces are aligned for and against the pipeline 's construction
the president says he *'ll* decide on whether or not to allow construction in coming months
