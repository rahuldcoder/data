-- as we learned in past battles with polio and @entity6 , the key to solving a massive health crisis is to move public sentiment away from fear and stigmatization toward action and acceptance			1
that is why a recent ad campaign about @entity14 from @entity15 -- @entity16 or @entity17 -- is so encouraging an international humanitarian and medical organization with a long history of advocating for vulnerable populations , @entity16 joined in the @entity21 with ad agency @entity22 to turn public fear of @entity14 on its head by asking people to donate a hazmat suit to workers in @entity28			1
the symbol of the fearful hazmat suit is reintroduced as a crucial piece of the solution : " here it 's a costume			1
" with a message of hope that asks us to get beyond our irrational fears of exposure to @entity14 here in the @entity21 , @entity15 focuses on our enormous power as individuals to participate in solving the global crisis that is unfolding			1
perhaps more important is this suggestion in the ad from @entity16 : medical workers are also at risk of becoming vulnerable , to stigmatization and marginalization , as a result of their direct contact with @entity14 at its source			1
this threat to their status comes at a time when we most urgently need doctors and caretakers on the ground in @entity28			1
@entity62 , executive director of @entity63 , told me , " @entity14 may be the largest humanitarian crisis of the century , " adding that the current challenge " is driving the system beyond its capability			1
" history shows us that the world 's response at the moment when effectiveness could be at its highest can in fact be slowed if public perceptions and government actions penalize or stigmatize doctors , health workers and caretakers working on the front line of a crisis			0
@entity6 , for example , still stands as one of the most politicized , feared and controversial diseases in modern history and its spread in the early 1980s is partially attributed to the marginalization of its victims and caretakers by the press , government and traditional health care institutions			2
the media defined @entity6 originally , as a " gay man 's " illness , and then a disease of " the @entity97 " : homosexuals , heroin addicts , hemophiliacs and @entity101			2
each group was , for different reasons , already on the outside of mainstream @entity21 social norms -- feared and often ignored by many @entity21 -- and @entity6 pushed them further outside the circle of public empathy and institutional help			2
early attempts by advocacy groups to turn around negative public perception failed because there was little objective information about what caused the disease , and so fear and ignorance prevailed in the public consciousness			0
health care workers stayed away from treating @entity6 patients , leaving communities on their own to deal with the growing crisis			1
local groups , like @entity124 's @entity123 , were virtually the only place for dying victims to turn to for help in the early 1980s			0
to make matters worse , the @entity21 government did not jump in to guide the public narrative on @entity6 , and the vacuum was filled with inaction , for the most part , on treatment and cures			1
it was clear by the end of 1981 that @entity6 was a national threat , but president @entity138 did n't publicly mention the disease until late 1985 , by which time acknowledging the epidemic was unavoidable : @entity6 had become the leading cause of death among all @entity21 age 25 to 44			2
in the era of polio , starting in the @entity21 in the early 20th century through the 1950s , a similar pattern of stigmatization and lack of leadership emerged			0
the healthy pushed away the diseased in fear , locking away the afflicted in attics , hiding them in institutions and exiling them to the sidelines of life , long after they had passed the contagious stage			0
forty years passed with no overarching government strategy to find a cure or ensure victims ' basic rights , until @entity162 accidentally discovered the polio vaccine and victims ' advocacy groups took up the charge by starting the disability rights movement			0
@entity168 , who contracted polio in 1921 at age 39 , was paralyzed from the waist down and used a wheelchair			0
@entity168 understood the power of the public 's fear of polio to stigmatize him in the minds of voters			2
like the hazmat suit that symbolizes @entity14 and elicits fear today , @entity168 's wheelchair would have been a powerful symbol of polio in the @entity21 mind in the 1930s if he had let people see it : @entity168 scrupulously hid it from public view to avoid any association with the disease			1
there are only three known photographs of @entity168 sitting in a wheelchair			0
only in recent years has @entity168 been viewed by many as a hero for how he doggedly overcame the stigma of the disease in the face of widespread public discrimination against polio victims			2
it is possible we can chart a better course in the future on @entity14 by learning from the mistakes of the past in our response to @entity6 and polio			1
first , there needs to be a @entity21 government - led public health strategy to deal with the @entity14 crisis here , and across the ocean at its source			1
no other country , or single international organization , has the credibility to lead on this issue			0
the @entity221 , along with the @entity219 and other key government agencies , is crucial to establishing the policies , action agenda and outlining the priorities to beat this disease , and to focus and coordinate all the international players who need to be involved			0
second , everyone involved in the public dialogue needs to come together to address and manage the ongoing fears of an epidemic in the @entity21			0
while experts may believe they 're relieving our fears when they tell us we 're safe , it is difficult to feel safe with the frequent reports of another individual suspected of being infected on our shores			0
in reality , an @entity14 epidemic is not a threat to @entity21 at home : the @entity21 health system is the best prepared on the planet to treat and cure @entity14 patients			2
but ongoing fear distracts us from focusing on the urgency of treating @entity14 at the source in @entity28			1
third , stigmatization slowed the cures for polio and @entity6 and , without any legitimate reason , marginalized people for being victims of a disease they had no control over			1
key to the conversation at this moment is that our response to the @entity14 crisis can be dangerously slowed if we repeat those mistakes of stigmatization			2
we are at risk of rejecting the wrong people in this war -- not only the victims , but the doctors and health workers who are courageously caring and fighting the scourge			0
if we allow the very workers we need on the ground in @entity28 to be stigmatized when they come home , this will take longer to solve			2
this is exactly the moment when health workers need to be encouraged to be on the front line , and recognized as heroes for doing so when they return			0
finally , @entity14 needs an official face , a spokesperson high up in the @entity21 government who is the credible , expert public voice of the disease both here and abroad			0
the @entity221 seems to have missed the opportunity to connect the power of its pulpit with an official posture that can help stem fear and stigmatization , and bring a coherent message to the effort			0
they see @entity14 as an administrative challenge and appointed @entity296 as @entity14 czar , because " the job is regarded as a managerial challenge " and @entity296 is seen " at the @entity221 as a good manager with excellent relationships "			0
leading the @entity14 conversation is not an administrative task ; it 's an important way to connect government policy to people 's concerns and emotions , to move opinion away from fear toward information and hope			1
which is why the ad campaign for @entity17 is meaningful : a credible voice that starts to fill the vacuum and pushes us to shift our perceptions of @entity14 toward hope and life .			1

@entity321 : we need to avoid stigmatizing @entity14 as we did @entity6 , polio
