-- @entity1 had tripped before			2
but this time , she fell hard			2
she could n't seem to control her body as she went down , even to protect her face from hitting the concrete sidewalk			2
it happened again the next day as she stepped off an escalator			2
then again in the parking garage on monday when she went to work			2
" i had no idea what was going on , " the 33 - year - old remembers			2
" i had no idea why i would just drop all of a sudden			2
" the third time , she went to the emergency room , where a neurologist ordered an mri and a cardiologist performed a tilt test -- normally done on patients who faint because of a sudden drop in blood pressure			2
doctors sent @entity24 home with instructions to drink more water			2
@entity24 continued to trip over nothing			2
so she went to the @entity30 , where she says her symptoms " baffled " doctors in the rheumatology , cardiology and neurology departments			2
back home in @entity36 , @entity37 , a suburb of @entity39 , @entity24 made an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon to address the extreme pain in her hips and lower back			2
he sent her to a neurosurgeon , who in turn sent her to see a neurologist who specialized in neuromuscular disorders			2
meanwhile , @entity24 tried to avoid open spaces			2
she hugged walls so that if her body froze up , she would n't fall flat on her face			2
she already had a few loose teeth , and her nose was a mix of blue and purple			2
one night , @entity24 and her sister were watching " @entity62 " when the woman being interviewed began describing @entity24 's symptoms			2
the woman had been diagnosed with @entity64 , or @entity64 , a rare neurological disorder characterized by painful muscle spasms and progressive stiffness in the lower back and limbs			1
could that be it ? the @entity70 asked themselves			2
they had never heard of @entity64			1
but @entity24 's latest neurologist thought they could be right			0
while waiting for the test results , he put @entity75 on benzodiazepine , a medication that is known to lessen the symptoms of @entity64			1
for the first time in nearly a year , @entity24 was able to walk without assistance			0
read more of @entity1 's story on @entity83 the exact prevalence of @entity64 is unknown , according to the @entity85 , but one estimate places it at one in every 1 million people			1
that means about 316 people in the @entity91 have it			1
the exact cause of @entity64 is also unknown			1
doctors believe it has something to do with a deficiency of glutamic acid decarboxylase , or @entity99			0
@entity99 is involved in the body 's production of gamma - aminobutyric acid , which helps control muscle movement			1
in patients with @entity64 , antibodies mistakenly attack certain neurons that produce @entity99 , leaving the body without the protein it needs			1
the symptoms of @entity64 generally start to appear in patients after age 30			1
people with @entity64 initially experience muscle stiffness or discomfort			1
as the disease progresses , muscle spasms and rigidity become more pronounced			1
these muscle spasms can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours , and are triggered by unexpected noises , physical contact , stress and / or emotional anxiety			1
" i 've fallen on the streets and prayed to @entity127 that someone would n't run over me , " says @entity125 , who was diagnosed with @entity64 five years ago			1
" my husband ca n't touch my arm			0
my kids ca n't give me hugs			0
" @entity125 compares the muscle spasms to childbirth			1
imagine contractions felt in the uterus happening from your neck down to your toes , she says			0
the whole body goes stiff -- hence the syndrome 's name			0
when she first began experiencing symptoms , @entity125 could n't dress herself			0
her 9 - year - old son had to help her put on her underwear , because his older siblings had all moved out and her husband went to work early			0
" it was embarrassing for him and it was embarrassing for me , " she remembers			0
while there is no cure yet for @entity64 , patients are often put on benzodiazepines to treat muscle stiffness and calm the spasms			1
anti-seizure medications and painkillers are sometimes prescribed as well to lessen symptoms			0
yet after years of freezing and falling unexpectedly because of stress or sudden sounds , many patients with @entity64 develop agoraphobia , an irrational fear of certain places and / or situations			1
they become housebound , unable to venture outside their comfort zone			0
" my mind knows i 'm ok , but my body wo n't cooperate , " @entity125 says			0
" if i try to go outside , my body completely stiffens up , and i will fall over flat			0
you can put a sticker on my head and put me up for sale			0
i 'm a statue for your lawn			0
" a few years ago , @entity125 underwent intravenous immunoglobulin therapy , or @entity178 , a common treatment for patients with @entity64			1
with @entity178 , a concentrated solution of sterilized antibodies is given to the patient through one of their veins			0
@entity178 is most commonly used to help people with autoimmune disorders			1
although @entity64 is a neurological disorder , it has " features " of an autoimmune disease , according to the @entity191			1
those features could eventually lead scientists to a cure			0
dr. @entity197 , medical director of regenerative medicine at @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 , has been studying the effects of stem cell transplantation on autoimmune diseases for close to a decade			1
five years ago , a patient with @entity64 approached him with her medical history			1
she had done her research , @entity197 says , and told him that a stem cell transplant could restore her immune system -- ridding it of the antibodies fighting against @entity99 production			1
" she made a very compelling case that this was worth trying , " @entity197 remembers			0
" that 's how i learned about @entity64			1
" during a stem cell transplant , doctors use strong doses of chemotherapy to wipe out the patient 's immune system			1
they then return purified bone marrow stem cells to the body			1
" it appears that as the immune system regrows , it 's like a baby 's immune system , " @entity197 says			0
" it recognizes what 's part of the body , and is able to fight against germs and pathogens			0
" it 's a dangerous procedure			0
when their immune system is wiped out , patients are prone to infection and organ damage			0
as such , it is reserved for those with only the most severe autoimmune diseases			0
@entity197 decided @entity64 fit that bill and performed the stem cell transplant			1
his first @entity64 patient is now symptom - free , he says , and off all medications typically used for treating the rare disorder			1
he performed another transplant on a second @entity64 patient two years ago			1
that patient is symptom - free as well , he says , though she still relies on a few medications			0
" i did n't believe the procedure would work so well , " @entity197 says			0
" it 's like a miracle to see what she was like before , and to see her now -- it 's quite dramatic			0
" @entity125 will be @entity197 ' third @entity64 patient			1
last week , doctors harvested her stem cells for sterilization			1
she hopes to receive her last dose of chemotherapy soon , so they can then start rebuilding her immune system			0
@entity197 is cautious about saying stem cell transplantation is the definitive treatment for @entity64			1
the results have been encouraging , but the procedure has only been done in two patients			0
the rarity of the disease makes it difficult to find research funding -- not to mention participants			1
all three procedures were performed in @entity201 under the country 's universal health care system			0
doctors at @entity276 in @entity277 have an open clinical trial protocol for doing stem cell transplants on patients with @entity64 , says dr. @entity281			1
unfortunately , most insurance carriers in the @entity91 will not cover the cost of the transplant			0
@entity24 is trying to raise $ 400,000 as a deposit			0
the @entity37 resident has been bedridden since october			0
she has spasms that cause her whole body to stretch out and shake			1
her brother is the only one strong enough to bend her legs when they go stiff			0
she lives with her parents , and someone has to be home 24/7			0
@entity24 has made many new friends through rare disease support groups online			1
they 're so few and far between it 's often the only way patients with @entity64 can find each other			1
she and @entity125 have communicated through @entity300			0
" it 's a very lonely life , " @entity125 says			0
" i talk to them every day and they talk to me			0
... these people need to believe that there 's hope			2
