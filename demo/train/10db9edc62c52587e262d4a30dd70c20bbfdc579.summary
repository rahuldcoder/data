-- airports are known for rules and regulations , a reputation that applies to the runways as well			1
almost all airport designs are governed by regulations established by the @entity8 to ensure pilots circling @entity10 or @entity11 remain properly oriented and deliver passengers and cargo safely			1
@entity14 turns those strictures into art , with the help of @entity18			1
the @entity20 - based designer has made a meticulous study of airport runways and logged the results on a @entity24 called @entity25			1
these views reveal beautiful compositions at airports that are nothing special at ground level			1
" i 've found even the most humdrum cities or outdated terminals can have beautiful compositions from bird 's - eye , " @entity31 says			1
" even @entity36 rocks ! " dozens of carefully cropped images reveal common traits among airports , and the logic and order embodied by seemingly random lines becomes clear			1
here are some tips to help make sense of the mishmash of lines and symbols you might see from seat @entity50			2
runway math airport runways are n't numbered based on priority , but compass bearings			1
a runway that is 194 ° away from magnetic north would be simplified to 190 ° to prevent rounding errors , and the last digit is dropped , leaving it at 19			2
fun fact : most runways are able to be used in both directions , and when approached from the opposite side the runway 's number is achieved by subtracting 18 or 180 °			1
flying @entity66 airports use a specialized font to number their runways			1
it 's highly geometric , which eliminates confusing curves and can be reduced to simple schematics , making it easy for groundskeepers lacking typographic training to recreate			2
the font apparently has no name , but the numbers are called " runway designators " in pilot parlance			2

many airports are built on soft soils , so a fully - loaded @entity98 , weighing 230 metric tons at takeoff , will sink into a patch of sod quickly , requiring hours of recovery , repair , and rerouting			1
@entity103 ! @entity103 ! not only does the @entity103 refuse to get on board with the metric system and day / month notation , but we ca n't even agree with anyone aside from the @entity109 on what to call the area of pavement where passengers get on and off the planes			0
from @entity116 in @entity117 to the @entity118 in central @entity119 , this area is called an apron			0
here in the states , we call it a ramp			0
whatever you do , do n't call it a tarmac unless it 's actually got a tar surface			0
@entity129 's @entity128 a runway , like most roads , has a center line			0
but there are plenty of markings unfamiliar to drivers			0
eight white bars that resemble piano keys mark the threshold and give pilots an indication of where it would be safe to touch down			0
two large white rectangles are the aiming points — the areas pilots should , well , aim for , followed by touchdown markers represented by four white bars			0
chevrons at the end of the runway mark the direction of a given strip , but if your plane hits one during takeoff or landing know that a disaster was narrowly averted			0

no pilots actually say this , but it 's good to know that if you see white lines and markings it means you 're en route to take off			0
if you see yellow lines and markings , you 're stuck on the taxiway			0
about the artist @entity31 always has lived under the flight paths of airports -- a tiny municipal airstrip in her hometown and @entity185 in @entity186 -- and grew fascinated by the cadence of departures and the changing flight paths over the course of the day			1
during a moment of wanderlust she opened @entity18 and started contemplating runway layouts from a birds - eye perspective			1
@entity31 traveled the globe , virtually , to create beautiful images based on bureaucratic design guidelines			1
with her art direction , @entity200 's broad expanses of dull grey concrete tiles became dynamic			2
her crop of a runway in @entity206 , @entity207 , laced with bright yellow lines became a work worthy of @entity210			2
and hidden treasures , like an inscription in honor of @entity214 , was uncovered in the aesthetic wasteland that is @entity216 's @entity216			0
each image starts with a clear itinerary , but @entity31 is open to diversions			1
" i 'm really drawn to the patterns , line work , and typography on the tarmac — especially as it contrasts with the geography , " she says			2
" i was really inspired by the @entity227 after mapping it for @entity25			0
everything seemed so considered and straightforward , which lent itself to stronger compositions , " she says			0
turns out , @entity232 is considered a textbook example of good runway design , known for maximizing the flow of air traffic in a compressed amount of space			2
