-- @entity1 vs. @entity2 ! @entity3 vs. @entity4 ! tuesday night unleashed a trio of new shows into competitive time slots : @entity9 's " @entity10 , " @entity11 ' " vegas " and — probably the most buzzed - about of the bunch — @entity9 's " the @entity13			1
" here 's how they stacked up			2
first , @entity1 's debut disappointed a bit			2
" the @entity13 " ( 4.7 million viewers , 2.4 ) was down 23 percent from last year 's " @entity20 " premiere in this slot and dropped from its lead in			1
still , " @entity13 " fended off its 9:30 p.m. comedy rival , @entity25 's " @entity24 " ( 5.2 million , 2.0 )			1
" @entity13 " also performed better than @entity9 's other new sitcom			1
at 8:30 p.m. , " @entity10 " ( 4.2 million , 2.0 ) opened weak			2
both " @entity13 " and " @entity10 " had the benefit of the same lead - in ( weirdly )			1
@entity9 aired a special " @entity30 " ( 5.3 million , 2.7 ) at 8 p.m. , then aired " @entity30 's " official regular time - period debut at 9 p.m. ( 5.2 million , 2.7 )			1
both episodes delivered the same demo number , down a steep 44 percent from last fall 's series premiere			1
the 9 p.m. " @entity30 " tied @entity25 's " @entity34 " ( 7.3 million , 2.7 )			1
the @entity4 comedy was down a bit this week , but @entity25 will gladly accept this outcome against the return of a tough rival			1
oh , why ca n't all these sitcoms just be friends ? ( friends ? )			0
' @entity43 ' : hints about the ' finish line ' at 10 p.m. , @entity11 rolled out " vegas			2
" i got ta confess : thought i did n't publicly bet on " vegas , " i was starting to think this show could be a ratings surprise			0
so i was expecting a bigger number here			0
@entity49 ( 14.7 million , 2.5 ) delivered a rather huge total audience for this slot , yet a weak adult demo rating ( translation : a lot of older folks watched )			2
shows like " @entity60 , " which we 'll get to in a minute , manage to have the best of both worlds — delivering a ton of older viewers , but also a big enough younger viewers to still kick butt where it counts ( from an advertising perspective , at least )			0
the premiere of " vegas " is ... fascinatingly schizophrenic			0
based on total viewers , " vegas " drew the biggest @entity11 fall drama premiere audience this time period since " @entity74 " in 2002			0
vegas is also , based on the 18 - 49 demo , the lowest - rated @entity11 tuesday drama premiere since something called " @entity80 " back in 2004 ... i 'm not even convinced that 's a real show			1
so " vegas " breaks records in two different directions			0
expect to see a lot of conflicting headlines around the web about this one			0
' new girl ' : @entity92 pics ! so let 's take a step back now : @entity11 won the night ; @entity95 came in fourth			0
the return of " ncis " ( 20.2 million viewers , 4.1 ) was the night 's top - rated show and only down a smidgeon from last year , followed by a similar story for @entity60 : @entity102 ( 16.7 million , 3.4 )			2
in addition to its comedies , @entity25 had " @entity105 " ( 11.3 million , 4.0 ) , down 15 percent , and @entity106 ( 4.8 million , 1.8 ) , steady			1
@entity95 had " @entity107 " ( 11.6 million , 2.0 ) , which continued the all - star edition 's bummer ratings story this fall , down 31 percent			2
the return of " private practice " ( 6.6 million , 1.9 ) was down 32 percent from last fall 's thursday premiere and down somewhat from @entity113 in this slot last year — taking " private practice " off its " @entity116 " life support on thursdays firmly hurt it			1
now let 's taken an even bigger step back : all three of the newbies — " @entity122 , " " vegas " and even " @entity10 " — launched to a workable number ... " @entity10 " just barely so			0
comedies sometimes grow from their premieres , while @entity11 ' drama audience is like giant migrating herd that gradually shifts around the schedule as the viewers develop new habits			0
let 's see what next week holds ... see the original article at @entity0			0
