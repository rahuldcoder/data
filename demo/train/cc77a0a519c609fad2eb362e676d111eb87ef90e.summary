thanks to climate change , you 'll be more likely to get struck by lightning as the years pass , scientists say			2
make that 50 % more likely for those who are around at the end of the century			1
" with warming , thunderstorms become more explosive , " says @entity9 climate scientist @entity8			1
he and his colleagues studied 11 climate models to arrive at their calculations , which they published in friday 's issue of the journal @entity18			1
more warmth equals more water vapor in the air , which is the fuel for thunderstorms			1
that equals more lightning and more of it zapping the ground			2
and people standing on it			0
15 electrifying lightning photos the current odds of becoming a human lightning rod in one 's lifetime come in at around 1 in 12,000 , the @entity32 roughly estimates			0
if @entity8 and his colleague are right , those odds would slim to 1 in 8,000 by the year 2100			0
certainly , many people are satisfied to live with that level of personal risk			0
but @entity42 offers for consideration that lightning strikes also spark half of all wildfires			2
and fires caused by lightning are harder to put out , he says			0
while working up the long - term predictions , @entity8 and his colleagues came upon a useful way of predicting the frequency of lightning strikes in the here and now			1
they found they could determine fluctuations in that frequency if they knew the amount of precipitation falling and the speed and occurrence of " convective clouds " rising high into the atmosphere			0
then they studied the 11 models on projected global temperature increases to predict how much these two factors should surge in the distant future , resulting in more lightning strikes if carbon dioxide emissions continue on their current path .			1

warming means more water vapor in the air , says @entity9 climate scientist
study using 11 climate models is *reported* in the latest issue of the journal @entity18
scientist @entity8 : lightning strikes will be 50 % more common by century 's end
more lightning striking the ground means more people hit , more wildfires , he says
