-- in this acrimonious and bitter @entity5 summer of 2010 , a summer during which at times it has seemed that everyone is angry at everyone else , i sat outside the other afternoon and read a magazine			1
the cover date on the issue was july 4 , 1955			2
the middle of the 1950s was the apex of the era in which life -- the weekly life -- was a mainstay in @entity5 homes			1
arriving like clockwork in mailboxes in big cities and tiny towns , life , with its 20 - cent cover price and its red - and - white rectangular logo , represented @entity5 talking to itself			1
it did n't just mirror the national conversation ; it was , in large measure , the national conversation			0
fat and prosperous , seemingly as tall as the @entity30 when compared to today 's magazines , life in the summer of ' 55 offered on its numerous advertising pages remedies for the sweltering days and nights the nation was going through : four separate display ads for different brands of lemonade , ads for window - mounted air conditioners and fans , colorful full - page ads for fancy ice cream ( @entity45 , @entity46 )			1
but that was not the fascinating thing about this particular issue			0
that is not what , in this rancorous summer of 2010 , has the power , over all the years , to make you stop and reflect			0
near the front of the magazine , the lead story summed up the mood of the @entity5 in the week that had just ended			1
the headline was : " nobody is mad with nobody			0
" the magazine reported : " @entity64 , announced by graduation and the @entity66 , rolled over a nation up to its ears in domestic tranquility			1
" and : " embroiled in no war , impeded by no major strikes , blessed by almost full employment , the @entity5 was delighted with itself and almost nobody was mad with nobody			1
" and : " this week millions of @entity5 were purring with contentment -- when they were not roaring with exuberance			1
" and : " the satisfaction showed in the grinning faces of @entity79 , hearing an easygoing speech by the president of the @entity5 it was evident in the triumph of a @entity85 standing amid chest - deep wheat where there had been only dust weeks before			1
the great nation , made possible by the bold planning of the @entity91 , had reached a peak the planners could scarcely have imagined			0
" how much of this may have been an illusion ? what portion of @entity32 's snapshot of the @entity5 in that summer 55 years ago may have been a willful fantasy , a purposely comforting dream ? certainly a case can be made that , even in placid times , the cloudless rendering of unfettered happiness that life was selling was in part a carefully marketed image of the country			1
@entity110 , in his excellent recent biography of life founder @entity109 , used that very issue of life among his examples of @entity109 's desire to build national consensus : of @entity109 's determination to convince @entity5 that they had a great shared purpose , and that they were doing just fine			1
history tells us that the @entity5 of 1955 may not have been quite the unblemished , unremittingly joyful land described in that issue			1
you 're probably already checking off the things about @entity5 that needed fixing back then : racial inequity was widespread , constrictive conformity was all around , intolerance of anything different was itself tolerated ... your list could go on and on			2
but here is what should give us pause : if monolithic national happiness was , in fact , being sold as a commodity back then , a case can also be made that the commodity being sold to us today is national animosity			0
just about every day , we are told how furious we are at each other			0
if @entity109 's @entity32 was endeavoring to promote the notion of consensus , what we are being relentlessly barraged with now is a message of anti-consensus			1
and that may be just as false an impression , in its own way , as the everyone 's - joyful pitch was in 1955			2
it 's a possibility that is at least worth thinking about			0
the television airwaves these days are bristling with images of rage , yes			0
but is that rage truly a representation of how most @entity5 feel about each other ? @entity158 has always been an easy sell ; that early hit television show was known as the " @entity161 , " not the " friday night handshakes			2
" in 2010 the three cable tv networks that specialize in news coverage are the place where @entity5 's disagreements are on perpetual display , where the conversations tend to be the most vigorous , and sometimes the most high - decibel			1
they often depict a nation ready to duke it out			0
yet on a given evening , the combined peak total of people watching the three news networks on cable at a given moment seldom exceeds 5 million			0
out of a @entity5 population of 310 million			2
is there anything to be made of that -- of the fact that more than 90 percent of the country may be tuning out the constant battles , may be symbolically choosing to hit the " mute " button ? and even putting that aside , is there a chance that in this allegedly angry summer , a significant portion of the country may elect not to wake up all that angry with their fellow citizens ? that there may be an underreported reservoir of good will , and willingness to listen to the other guy , out there ? that the country yearns for lowered voices and reasoned conversation ? for a shared purpose , a steady middle ground ? just asking the question , for your end - of - summer consideration			2
" nobody is mad with nobody , " life declared , 55 summers ago			0
it may have merely been a pipe dream			0
but in the words of a great @entity214 philosopher : would n't it be nice			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			2

in summer of 1955 , @entity32 featured a story titled : " nobody is mad with nobody "
it depicted a nation at rest , calm and secure in its contentment
@entity218 asks if that image of @entity5 tranquility was real
he also asks if today 's image of @entity5 as an angry nation is real
