furloughed workers , reduced combat readiness , shrunken naval operations and cuts to @entity4 flying hours and weapons maintenance			1
defense secretary @entity6 listed those consequences as he provided a stark warning on wednesday about the effects of impending budget cuts on the military unless @entity12 acts to avert them			1
the result , he said , would be " the most serious readiness crisis " faced by the armed services in over a decade			0
@entity6 's address at @entity18 , which he called " hopefully one of my last speeches as secretary of defense , " included the first details of how the @entity20 would deal with the automatic spending cuts -- or sequestration in congressional jargon -- set to trigger march 1 across federal agencies			1
for the @entity20 , sequestration would mean almost $ 500 billion in cuts over 10 years			2
for 2013 alone , some $ 46 billion in reduced spending would result in " a serious disruption in defense programs and a sharp decline in our military readiness , " @entity6 said			1
opinion : how to avoid job - killing budget cuts " there are no good options " to deal with the situation , he continued , saying 46,000 department jobs would be at risk and more damaging measures in coming months could include : -- furloughing as many as 800,000 civilian workers for up to 22 days ; -- cutting back on @entity46 training and maintenance , which would reduce readiness of combat brigades outside @entity50 ; -- shrinking naval operations ; and , -- reducing @entity4 flying hours and weapons systems maintenance			1
" this is not a game			0
this is reality , " @entity6 said , his voice rising			1
" these steps would seriously damage a fragile @entity59 economy and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe			2
" his comments sought to increase pressure on @entity68 and @entity69 to reach agreement on deficit - reduction steps , thereby avoiding the across - the - board spending cuts of sequestration that were part of a 2011 deal that raised the federal debt ceiling			1
on tuesday , president @entity77 called for a short - term deal to put off the cuts so @entity12 could continue work on a permanent fix that provides desired reductions in the federal deficit			1
@entity77 made clear that he still wants a broader deficit - reduction agreement with @entity68 that includes spending cuts , some entitlement reforms and increased revenue from eliminating some tax breaks			1
however , @entity77 said , with time running out before the sequestration cuts slash government spending and result in job losses and economic slowdown , @entity12 should pass a temporary fix that would allow time for further negotiations on a broader plan			1
by the numbers : recent defense spending " compromise is a way to achieve it , " @entity101 spokesman @entity100 told reporters wednesday , noting that @entity77 continued to offer proposals to cut spending and increase revenue that shifted to the middle from his original stances			2
however , house speaker @entity111 , @entity112 , accused @entity77 and @entity69 of avoiding needed spending cuts and trying to put off tough decisions instead of facing their responsibilities as elected leaders			1
deficit reduction should focus on cutting government spending and must include savings from popular entitlement programs such as @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , @entity111 insisted on wednesday			0
" at some point , @entity126 has to deal with its spending problem , " he told reporters			0
" i 've watched them kick this can down the road for 22 years			0
i 've had enough of it			0
it 's time to act			0
" @entity111 also echoed @entity135 @entity68 leader @entity134 of @entity136 in opposing @entity77 's call for including more tax revenue in the mix. opinion : republicans , be smart about defense cuts also wednesday , @entity68 legislators proposed $ 85 billion in reduced spending through attrition -- or not filling all vacated government jobs -- and freezing congressional pay as an alternative to the sequestration this year			1
they said the plan achieves the same amount of deficit reduction without more tax revenue sought by @entity77 and @entity69			0
the debate continues the ideological showdown between @entity68 and @entity69 over the size and role of government			2
republicans driven by their conservative base want to reduce government and taxes to fund it , arguing that is the best way to grow the economy			0
@entity69 promote a strong government safety net through entitlements and support programs that they say bolsters middle - class opportunity necessary for economic growth			0
@entity12 and the @entity101 agreed to the sequestration cuts as part of the 2011 debt ceiling deal that ended a showdown over whether to increase the federal government 's borrowing limit to meet its obligations			1
the automatic spending cuts never were intended to become law , but instead were designed to be so unwieldy and overbearing that @entity12 would reach a broader deficit reduction deal to avoid them			1
military pay in play in game of political poker deep partisan divisions prevented such an agreement from happening in 2012 , an election year			2
initially the cuts were to go into effect on january 2 , but the government delayed the impact of sequestration for the first two months of 2013			1
in his speech , @entity6 referred to what he described as " partisan dysfunction in @entity12 " that he said threatens the quality of life and national security of the nation			1
instead of making tough decisions to resolve problems , political leaders from both parties let issues become crises that require immediate but insufficient responses , he said			0
" it 's the easy way out , " @entity6 said , adding that there is a price to be paid for such an approach			0
" you lose the trust of the @entity59 people , " he said			0
" you create an aura of constant uncertainty that pervades every issue and gradually undermines the very credibility of the nation			0
" @entity219 explains : sequestration in another effort to stoke public alarm over the pending cuts , @entity100 told reporters that top defense contractors met at the @entity101 with senior administration officials to discuss the impacts on their industry			2
according to @entity100 , those impacts would be overwhelmingly negative			0
" it 's not just a parlor game here in @entity126 , " he said of the issue			0
" these are real - world decisions that significantly affect the economy and the @entity59 people			2
" @entity77 said tuesday that he still supports a broader deficit deal and made clear that revenue from tax reform measures previously agreed to by @entity68 -- such as eliminating some loopholes to increase revenue for the government -- should be part of it			0
@entity111 , however , reiterated the @entity68 call for replacing the sequester plan with spending cuts and reforms -- a reference to changes in entitlement programs			1
a last - second agreement in the previous @entity12 that passed in the first days of 2013 raised tax rates on top income earners as part of a limited deficit - reduction package			2
that measure followed weeks of tough negotiations involving @entity77 and @entity12 in which other steps to increase government revenue , such as eliminating some tax breaks for corporations , were considered but not included in the final deal			0
how our tribes cause gridlock in @entity12 @entity77 and @entity69 now want such revenue - raising steps to be part of a package that would replace the mandated deficit reduction of the sequester cuts			1
@entity272 expressed his opposition to such a move tuesday , saying , " the @entity59 people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the president signed into law			2
