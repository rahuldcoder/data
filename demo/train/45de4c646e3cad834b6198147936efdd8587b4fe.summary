-- @entity1 will not feature in a @entity3 final in the same calendar year for the first time since 2002 , after he was knocked out of the @entity6 by @entity8 's @entity7			1
the winner of 17 @entity3 titles , including five in @entity11 , suffered a straight sets defeat in his fourth round match at @entity14 , losing 7 - 6 ( 7/3 ) 6 - 3 6 - 4 late monday			1
the defeat denied the @entity17 star , arguably the finest player to have played the game , a quarter - final showdown with long - time nemesis @entity20 , after the in - form @entity8 star beat @entity24 's @entity23 6 - 7 ( 4 - 7 ) 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 1			1
@entity7 had never beaten @entity1 before their latest rain - delayed encounter on the @entity29 court			1
but with 43 unforced errors to his name and only two break points converted from 16 , the former world number one looked unlikely to extend that run			0
" i 'm going to feel like i beat myself , " @entity1 told reporters after the match			1
" it was up to me to make the difference and i just could n't			0
" i self - destructed , which is really disappointing			2
when things came to the crunch i just could n't do it			0
" @entity7 , by contrast , was full of confidence as he hit 70 % of his first serves and sent numerous forehand winners whistling past his illustrious opponent			2
the difference is i won the break points today , " said @entity7			1
with the ignominy of another early exit from a @entity3 tournament , @entity1 , whose ranking has slipped to an unfamiliar no. 7 , will face renewed speculation about his future			1
at 32 , some question whether he can arrest the recent decline in his fortunes -- his last major title was at @entity63 in 2012			1
" @entity1 is in a very vulnerable state			2
he 's in a vulnerable position because he 's moved down to no. 7 now , " said legendary coach @entity65 in a recent interview with @entity0			2
" remember @entity68 went through a tough period			0
fortunately for @entity68 he won a big one before he left the tour			2
" but with younger rivals @entity72 , @entity20 and @entity73 improving all the time , @entity1 will be acutely aware that his window of opportunity is rapidly closing			1
he has even experimented with a larger racquet head in a bid to find a solution to his on - court problems			0
and for @entity65 , who has coached a number of former @entity3 champions including @entity84 , there 's a real concern that an underwhelming end to his career could undo the @entity1 legacy			1
" it would be a shame if people forgot who he was , " he said			0
" look at what he brought to the game			0
he lived a beautiful private life			0
he 's always respectful of the sport			0
he 's respectful of his opponents			0
you do n't find too many people who represent life , whether it be business or sports , like this guy			0

five - time @entity6 champion @entity1 loses 7 - 6 ( 7/3 ) 6 - 3 6 - 4 to @entity7
this was the 32 - year - old 's earliest exit in @entity11 for 10 years
@entity1 was denied a quarter - final clash with rival , @entity8 's @entity20
the @entity17 star last won a @entity3 title in 2012 at @entity63
