there is no evidence so far that @entity9 had any " operational links " to other jihadists , according to the source , who drew a distinction between interacting online and plotting an attack			1
and when asked thursday by @entity65 's @entity251 if @entity9 is linked to a wider network of jihadists , @entity6 foreign minister @entity250 said " there 's no evidence , at this stage , for us to know that			1
... that 's something authorities are looking at right now			0
" he was not on a @entity6 list of possible extremists whatever his associations , @entity9 was n't high on @entity6 authorities radar when it comes to potential terrorist attacks			1
he was not among about 90 individuals that @entity6 authorities are examining for possible @entity149 extremist ties			1
" had we have known that he wanted to travel to @entity186 , and had we had some basis to suspect that he wanted to do that for a criminal purpose , then he certainly would have been " on that list , @entity42 said			1
the commissioner also noted , " there is no one path or formula to ... radicalization			0
and understanding each individual 's path to that state is the challenge			0
" he recently came to @entity202 , was staying at shelter @entity42 said @entity9 had been in the @entity6 capital since at least october 2			1
during those few weeks , he stayed at the @entity290 shelter , according to residents there			0
one resident , who asked to be identified only as @entity294 , recalled running into @entity295 -- who was then chanting and praying -- on the shelter 's stairs the night before the attack			0
" i just walked by and i started singing ( a @entity301 song ) , " @entity294 said			0
" and it did n't affect him at all			0
" perhaps related to his short time there , @entity9 did n't frequent mosques in @entity202 , according to @entity307 mosque imam @entity306 " we have no clue about that person , " @entity306 said			1
" and that kind of person should not have any place in our community			0
" he is believed to have acted alone all day wednesday , @entity6 officials vacillated back and forth on whether @entity9 acted alone			1
