-- the mother had less than a minute to decide : let her daughter go on alone and break up the family , or keep everyone together , unsure when they would ever make it out			2
" no , @entity10 ! " her younger daughter shrieked as the older one looked at her solemnly , eyes pleading to let her go			0
" you have to decide now ! " said the uniformed attendant holding the door open , voice loud and stern			0
this may sound like the dramatic climax of a harrowing tale of escape , and in a sense it is			0
it 's just one of many typical standby travel scenarios , in which passengers are faced with tough decisions in their efforts to snag unclaimed airline seats at deep discounts			1
there are two forms of standby travel : one covers most of us , who have paid to reserve a seat and for whatever reason find ourselves trying to get on a different flight			1
this includes people who get bumped from a flight and those trying to switch to a flight earlier or later in the day			0
then , there are " nonrevs , " the term for passengers from whom the airline does n't earn any revenue , which included the family in this particular scenario witnessed recently at the @entity52 airport			1
this elite fellowship consists largely of airline employees , their families and acquaintances -- the mythical buddy passengers			1
technically , they do n't buy seat reservations			2
instead , they list their names on a standby registry prioritized by relationship to the airline , giving them the chance to vie for remaining open seats after all of the paying passengers have boarded a flight			1
still , the wait could be days , as another family learned last week			1
@entity71 , his wife , and his two children , ages 13 and 4 , spent five days at the @entity76 airport waiting for a seats on a flight home to @entity80			1
the family was flying on buddy passes and could n't afford to buy seats , @entity71 told @entity0 affiliate @entity84			1
finally , after five days without a shower , they lucked out when a @entity84 viewer purchased tickets for a flight home			2
standby travel gets harder with its reliance on ever - decreasing empty airline seats , standby travel appears to be going the way of free food in coach			1
but savvy travelers with time to spare and the right mindset are still finding ways to game the system into free and discounted flights			1
it 's hard to quantify exactly how much standby travel has decreased in recent years , because airlines contacted by @entity0 would not share specific figures on nonrev travel			1
but interviews with several longtime standby pros suggested that it has become increasingly harder , simply because it 's hard to find an empty seat			1
travelers might arrive at the airport for the first flight out and wait until the last one			2
if returning standby , they might end up spending several extra days overseas or flying around @entity117 to catch connecting flights that will get them closer to home			1
however , a bold contingent of nonrevs remains undaunted			0
you can spot them at the airport watching flight information monitors like hawks , waiting for their initials to appear on the cleared list			2
but civility is also a requirement of standby travel as part of the airlines ' terms and conditions for taking advantage of this benefit			1
passengers keep a safe distance from the desk to avoid becoming a nuisance to airline staff , who are their only allies			2
after all , nonrevs know it 's out of their hands			0
there 's nothing anyone can do but wait and let the airline fates shine upon them if there 's room and their standby priority ranking is high enough			2
it 's not for the faint of heart , requiring a vast reserve of patience and a " @entity163 " attitude			0
there is no guarantee of success -- often up until the very last second -- which was the scenario this family found itself in one saturday morning in july			0
there was only one seat left , and there were three of them			0
raising the stakes was the fact that sunday was a blackout day , meaning whoever was left behind would have to tough it out in @entity52 for two days			0
' you ca n't be in a hurry ' " i can do it , " the older daughter said as the other started whimpering			1
" ok , yes , " the mother said			0
tears welled up her eyes as her daughter skipped toward the jetway without a second glance back			0
the mother choked back sobs as the door closed , and clutched her younger daughter as she wailed , " let me go			0
" " one of the toughest things to deal with is the lack of control that you have over the whole process , " said @entity193 , associate professor and chair of the @entity196 's @entity195 in @entity197 , @entity198			0
" you ca n't be in hurry and you have to be fairly philosophical about it , " @entity193 said			1
" if you go in with the mindset and understanding that when things go wrong or you do n't get on a specific flight or two or three , you have to be able to say this is part of the game			2
" there was a time when this manner of standby travel was open to anyone			1
if you were n't in a hurry , you could show up at the airport or call the airline ahead of time and get on the standby list , agreeing to wait until a flight had empty seats			1
@entity193 did it as a college student in 1981 , waiting at the @entity228 airport most of the day until he got a seat on a flight to @entity231 for less than half the price of a reserved seat			0
even then , getting back posed a bigger problem , and @entity193 waited several days before he got a flight back to @entity228			0
fewer empty seats to fill that was before airline deregulation , which made seats cheaper and more accessible			1
" now airlines are good at filling seats , " @entity193 said			0
" with @entity245 ( travel ) sites and last - minute deals and travel agents , it 's very rare today to have a flight taking off , especially at a busy destination , with 15 to 20 seats empty			1
" the risk is great , but so are the rewards : tickets averaging less than half the cost of a reserved seat , or nothing at all for some active employees , depending on the airline			0
plus if the open seat is in first class , then you could be flying first class to @entity231 for the cost of taxes			0
" if one assumes the mindset that travel in general , and standby travel in particular , is akin to a game that one plays , or is a challenge that one overcomes ... then the rewards of the novelty , excitement , and fun of travel are , ironically , all the more rewarding , " said travel expert @entity275 , who flew standby for free in 1984 after winning @entity278 ' @entity277 in 50 days contest			1
" you know that there are challenges , but there are also the rewards			0
i think many of us implicitly expect travel difficulties inherent in going standby , so it is , in a way , a sort of ' attitude inoculation			2
' somehow , knowing and expecting travel hurdles in conjunction with standby traveling -- and realizing that it is part and parcel -- is somewhat ' arming ' and preparing			2
" standby travel with conditions some airlines offer a form of standby to customers who have already purchased a seat reservation			1
it 's called same - day standby travel , but it sounds more like changing your flight on the same day without paying a fee			1
it 's often restricted to members of loyalty programs and even then , sometimes only to high - priority travelers			0
@entity312 ' " @entity314 " program for an alternate flight is available on departure day to certain customers and those traveling between specific cities			0
otherwise , anyone else can request same day standby for a fee while checking in online or at the airport			2
or you can just call and pay to change your flight , which is what many people end up doing to curtail the uncertainty			0
some airlines still offer standby revenue travel in limited circumstances			2
@entity331 offers traditional standby tickets through its " @entity338 " program , in which passengers 18 to 22 years old can call or go the airport and agree to wait until a seat opens up on a flight			2
one airline with less restrictions is @entity341 , which allows all passengers the option of listing standby within 24 hours of a reserved flight for travel between the same cities			1
passengers may travel one flight earlier than the scheduled departure on the same day , except when traveling out of a city with one daily flight			0
then , you can try to get on the flight the day before			0
of course , " standby travel is based on seat availability and is not guaranteed , " @entity341 says on its website			1
a cheaper flight , by necessity " people who do standby travel normally do so out of necessity rather than choice			1
for most of us , traveling standby is anxiety - inducing , stressful , " said @entity275			0
" it takes increasingly ' rare ' people who are equipped to be able to cope with the potentially ever - increasing chaotic mess of their travel - lives that results from standby travel			1
" having a backup plan helps , he said , like knowing whether you plan to sleep in the airport or to get a room			0
sometimes , travelers find another city to fly out of , leading to all kinds of adventures and misadventures			2
but those are tales for another day .			0

as empty airline seats become rarer , standby travel is getting harder to swing
