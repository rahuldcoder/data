one casualty of the massive protests that have rocked @entity2 since the end of september may have been the city 's relationship with its police force -- traditionally one of the region 's most well - regarded			1
with the use of tear gas to disperse crowds in the protests ' early days to the videoed beating of a cuffed demonstrator by plain clothes police officers in early hours of wednesday , the events of the past three weeks may have put the reputation of @entity2 's finest beyond repair			1
since an overhaul designed to weed out corruption in the 1970s , the city 's police have been a relatively benign influence in the city			2
following the 1997 handover of sovereignty to @entity28 , the force has peacefully monitored dozens of large - scale protests and sit - ins			0
however , the scale of the protests has caught the police arguably unprepared , with their tactics changing rapidly			1
police initially took an aggressive stance towards the protesters — letting loose pepper spray and tear gas and donning riot gear			1
but they later eased off , allowing protesters to occupy major highways uncontested and forming a human barricade to protect demonstrators from angry mobs of pro-government counter-protesters			2
however , the pendulum has swung back the other way over the past few days , with the re-emergence of pepper spray and batons , and a video showing a number of police officers dragging a handcuffed man to a secluded area before apparently kicking and punching him while others stand around , appearing to keep watch			1
the video has stunned many in the former @entity63 colony , and the authorities have pledged to launch an independent investigation			2
" police express concern over the video clip showing several plainclothes officers who are suspected of using excessive force , " said a statement issued by the @entity67 wednesday morning			1
" @entity73 has already received a relevant complaint and will handle it in accordance with the established procedures in a just and impartial manner			0
" @entity2 's secretary of security @entity78 told reporters the " officers involved will be temporarily removed from their current duties			1
" he declined to take questions			0
tear gas the use of 87 rounds of tear used by police on september 28 marked the first time it has been used in @entity2 since 2005 , when @entity92 farmers took to the streets to demonstrate against a @entity95 summit			1
but its use backfired , bringing swathes of @entity99 out to demonstrate in solidarity			0
" in international standards , tear gas is only used when there is violence or when people set fire to cars or stores , and not ( on ) peaceful protesters , " @entity101 , a spokesperson for the @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , told @entity104			1
many protesters are young students who did not expect the police to escalate their response so rapidly			1
" i felt really shocked when i knew that the police were using tear gas , " said @entity117 , a student activist who was on the scene and felt the full effect of the police 's attempts to disperse protesters on september 28			1
" @entity126 spray is already bad enough and then suddenly they used tear gas against protesters who were not attacking anyone			1
i was really shocked and very scared			2
" she says she panicked when the clouds of gas enveloped her			2
" i could n't breathe , my throat was so painful and i could n't see properly			0
i still went down ( to the site the following day )			0
it did n't change my determination			0
" the police have denied that they have been heavy - handed			2
" police are facing an unprecedented challenge , " @entity138 , a department spokesman , said during a press conference			2
" we have exercised maximum tolerance			0
the goal is to not provoke even more resentment and negative emotion among demonstrators			0
" police actions bring in more protesters indeed , when police have deployed more aggressive tactics , they have had far from the desired effect			1
instead of scattering the crowd , social media and tv spread news of the attacks , prompting thousands to flock to the protest site			2
there is a " breach of trust " between the public and the police , the @entity103 's @entity101 says , citing the example of one standoff outside the government headquarters earlier this month , when protesters accused police of smuggling in non-lethal armaments			1
" the police tried to bring weapons into headquarters			2
they told protesters they were only changing the shift ... but in the end they transported more weapons			2
so most protesters think that police always lie			1
" acts of aggression advocates of the pro-democracy camp say that , on several occasions , the police failed to act to maintain public order , particularly when pro-government groups stormed the protesters ' camps , tearing down tents , barriers and handmade signs , and getting into vocal -- and sometimes violent -- confrontations with demonstrators			1
on at least one occasion , pro-government supporters have sexually assaulted women at the protest sites as tensions boil over			0
" women and girls were among those targeted , including incidents of sexual assault , harassment and intimidation , " human rights group @entity200 said in a statement			0
" the police inaction ... is shameful			0
the authorities have failed in their duty to protect peaceful protesters who came under attack , " said @entity210 , the director of @entity200 @entity2			1
police have rejected the accusations that they failed to keep order , calling them " totally unfounded and extremely unfair to police officers who faithfully and diligently performed their duty at the scene			0
" rumors rumors that people have been offered money to stir up trouble -- with many pointing the finger at @entity226 -- at the protest sites have added to the sense of disillusionment with the police and the government			1
" we got offered hk $ 500 ( around $ 65 ) to go to @entity234 , to tear down the signs and shout and make noise , " the @entity232 ( @entity232 ) quoted one youth as saying			0
" they want us to make trouble so that the police have an excuse to stop the protest and arrest people			1
" requests by @entity104 to the @entity244 under @entity245 of the @entity246 in @entity226 for comment were not responded to			0
some analysts say that @entity226 has worked hard to get the police and other government institutions on side			0
" the police has been ' mainlandized ' and fed a lot of propaganda , " @entity252 , an adjunct professor , at the @entity253 , told @entity104			0
" the political neutrality of the civil service , the police , the @entity257 ( an independent anti-corruption agency ) is in jeopardy			0
" but one symbol of the protest -- a giant artwork based on a widely - disseminated photograph of a protester sheltering a police officer from the rain with an umbrella -- signals that @entity2 's faith in its police may not be entirely lost			1
" that picture is very meaningful			0
i aspire for freedom and peace , and that picture has shown that , " its creator , an artist known as @entity278 , told the @entity232			0
" it means that we care about everyone , even if ' everyone ' is the police force			0

a video seeming to show a protester beaten by police has shocked @entity2
police initially tried to disperse protesters with pepper spray and tear gas
police tactics have been *condemned* by rights , protest groups
actions may lead to *irreversible* *erosion* of trust between police and populace , say activists
