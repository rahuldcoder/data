the insurance industry is launching a seven - figure advertising , grassroots and lobbying campaign to persuade @entity5 officials not to cut @entity7 funding next year			1
a key piece of that campaign is a new television ad , obtained first by @entity11			0
the ad , which will begin airing thursday , comes as policy makers begin to set payment rates for next year			1
the preliminary rates for @entity7 program , which covers seniors through private insurance , will be announced next month , and final rates will be set in april			2
the ad campaign is part of a lobbying and media blitz by the insurance industry to avoid cuts to their @entity7 payments			1
the @entity27 cut the @entity7 program by $ 200 billion			2
the law and other policy changes cut the program by 6.5 % this year			1
insurance officials say the cuts are already forcing insurers to cut their doctor networks , and they warn that further cuts will increase cost and limit access to seniors " if the @entity7 plan is cut once again , seniors are going to find out in october that their costs are going up , their benefits are being reduced and they have fewer choices of providers and fewer coverage options , " said @entity38 , spokesman for the insurance industry trade group @entity39			2
in the tv ad , seniors tell @entity5 that they depend on their @entity7 coverage and will spread the word			1
" no more cuts to @entity7 , " @entity51 said			0
added @entity53 , " you know , we vote			0
" insurers believe that timing will help their cause			0
most seniors will find out about the new rates during open enrollment in october -- only weeks before congressional elections			0
and insurers are betting that lawmakers wo n't want to be explaining to 14 million seniors why their health care costs more or their benefits have decreased .			0
