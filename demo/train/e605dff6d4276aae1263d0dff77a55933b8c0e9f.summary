-- @entity1 is n't listening			1
the disconnect between the @entity4 people and the agenda being advanced in @entity1 is growing by the day			1
when @entity4 have spoken up , their voices have fallen on deaf ears			0
political expedience and partisan allegiances have repeatedly trumped the priorities of the @entity4 people			1
@entity4 wanted jobs , but instead @entity1 passed a " stimulus " that has failed to keep unemployment below 8 percent as promised -- while producing countless instances of government waste			1
@entity4 wanted lower health care costs , but instead @entity1 passed a health care law that will actually increase costs and hurt our economy			1
@entity4 want common - sense fiscal discipline , but @entity1 continues to spend money we do n't have and pile debt on future generations			1
the current approach in @entity1 is failing the @entity4 people , who deserve a @entity29 and a government that puts their priorities and everyday concerns first			1
it 's not enough , however , for @entity34 to simply state our principled opposition to the current agenda			2
we must also offer the @entity4 people a clear set of solutions they can expect us to fight for , a project that @entity41 @entity40 has tasked me to lead			2
shortly after beginning this important work , we realized that distrust in government runs too deep to simply hand down a policy plan from @entity1			2
more than just new policy , we also need to change the way @entity1 sets its policy			0
that notion is the driving force behind @entity4 speaking out , an unprecedented initiative designed to engage the public in a discussion of your priorities for @entity4			0
read more about the @entity34 's plan beginning next week , @entity58 @entity34 will be setting out across the country to hold @entity4 speaking out town halls , where we will seek your input on creating a new policy agenda			1
at the same time , we will be using all the technological tools available to us , such as phone apps and telephone town halls , to listen to the priorities of the @entity4 people			2
this effort includes a new interactive website -- @entity70 -- that will allow anyone , regardless of party , to submit what he or she believes should be a part of this new plan			0
we have developed this site to be the home for an online conversation between members of @entity29 and those they are elected to represent			0
these ideas and exchanges will serve as the building blocks for the governing agenda we will present to the @entity4 people later this year			1
of course , this will be a @entity34 agenda , so this project is designed to take core common - sense , conservative principles -- whether it 's building a smaller , more accountable government , economic freedom and lower taxes , or providing for a strong national defense -- and discuss how they can be applied to @entity4 's priorities			1
rather than a listening tour , we are seeking a robust debate about the challenges we face and the solutions that should be pursued			0
leadership is about laying out clear solutions to the challenges we face , just as we have offered positive alternatives to @entity104 policies with which we disagree			0
but leadership today also requires a humility that appreciates that @entity4 are really in charge of @entity29			0
@entity4 speaking out recognizes that the wisdom and will of the @entity4 people are the only things strong enough to change the course our nation is on			2
building a new agenda for our nation starts today , and we hope all @entity4 will join us in the process			0
