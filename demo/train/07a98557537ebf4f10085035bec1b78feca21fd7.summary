-- city commissioners in @entity2 , @entity3 , voted monday to reject the proposed resignation of their embattled police chief , who has been under fire for the handling of the probe into @entity10 's death in february			1
chief @entity11 has been on paid leave since march 22 , a day after the commission expressed a lack of confidence in him because of the case			0
he remains so after the commission 's decision , with capt. @entity20 continuing to serve as acting chief			2
@entity21 , who has said he killed the 17 - year - old @entity10 in self - defense , was not arrested after being questioned by police the night of the shooting			1
arrested weeks later after a special prosecutor was assigned to the case , he was released from jail early monday and hours later entered a not guilty plea			1
earlier monday , the city announced in a statement that a separation agreement had been reached with @entity11 to resign			1
if it was approved by the @entity33 , it would have taken effect at midnight			0
but by a 3 - 2 vote , the commission opted not to accept the proposed deal , which would have permanently dismissed @entity11 from the job and given him a severance package			0
two commissioners had questioned the fairness of @entity11 losing his job , while mayor @entity44 said he preferred to wait possibly several months for the results of an investigation into @entity11 and his department			0
" i 'm not ready to have him come back and run the @entity52 , but i do n't know if i 'm ready for this either , " @entity44 said , who sided with the majority to reject the resignation			0
@entity54 , a lawyer for @entity10 's family , criticized the commission for not letting @entity11 step down			1
" @entity2 residents deserve quality leadership in law enforcement who will handle investigations fairly for all people , " he said			2
" if chief @entity11 recognized that his resignation would help start the healing process in @entity2 , city leadership should have accepted it in an effort to move the city forward			1
" city manager @entity69 told @entity0 that " moving the city forward " is a priority , and something that he hoped might have been expedited by making @entity11 's departure final			2
during monday 's meeting , @entity69 explained that he and @entity11 had " agreed to " the resignation , after @entity11 " decided that he can no longer serve as police chief			1
" but @entity77 , a commissioner , pointed to other parts of the agreement stating @entity11 was " willing , ready and able " to remain on as chief , had n't been found to have done anything wrong and was resigning on @entity69 's " recommendation			2
" added @entity83 , another commissioner supportive of @entity11 , " what did the chief do wrong ? i mean , tell us			0
" @entity69 said an interim chief -- in place of @entity20 , the current acting chief -- could be in place early next week			0
the case has drawn intense media attention , with @entity2 residents and many civil rights leaders from outside central @entity3 criticizing the @entity52 for not immediately arresting @entity21 , 28 , after he shot the unarmed teenager			1
@entity94 : @entity21 wife talks publicly for the first time @entity21 is now free and awaiting trial , after making bail and leaving the @entity99 in @entity2 at 12:05 a.m. monday			1
" he 's doing well			0
he 's very glad to be out , trying to get settled in , still worried about his safety ... talking to his family and feeling much better than being in ( jail ) , " his lawyer @entity100 told @entity0 later monday			1
also monday , @entity100 filed documents in court in which @entity21 entered a written not guilty plea and waived the right to appear at a formal arraignment			1
@entity21 is now " on his own " with no police protection or security detail , @entity100 said , shuttling to and from several secret locations in light of threats against him and his family			1
he wore a bulletproof vest while leaving the jail accompanied by @entity119 , the owner of @entity120			0
" there 's been a lot of chatter lately about his release , and that 's concerning to him and us , " said @entity100			0
follow the timeline of case the @entity129 said that @entity21 had been fitted with a gps monitoring device , allowing authorities to track his location			2
@entity21 's release came as something of a surprise			1
over the weekend , his lawyer had said @entity21 might remain behind bars until the middle of this week as his team worked to secure funds to meet the $ 150,000 bail set last friday			2
with the 10 % cash payment customarily made to secure bond , @entity21 's family needed $ 15,000 for him to make bail			2
@entity10 's family was n't pleased by news of @entity21 's release , said one of their attorneys , @entity148			1
" it 's tough for them to see their son 's killer walk free again , " he said			0
the case has riveted the nation and sparked intense discussions about race , gun control and " stand your ground " laws , which make it legal for people to use deadly force when they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury			0
@entity3 to review ' stand your ground ' law although details of the shooting remain murky , what is known is that @entity10 ventured out on february 26 from the home of his father 's fiancee in @entity2 and went to a nearby convenience store , where he bought a bag of @entity181 and an @entity182			1
after spotting him , @entity21 called 911 to complain about a " suspicious " person in the neighborhood			0
in the call , the neighborhood watch volunteer said he followed @entity10 after the teen started to run , prompting the dispatcher to tell him , " we do n't need you to do that			0
" @entity21 claims the unarmed teen attacked him , before he fired his gun			0
@entity10 's supporters say @entity21 targeted @entity10 because he was black			1
on friday , @entity21 's father testified that when he saw his son the day after the shooting , he was wearing a protective cover over his nose , his face was swollen , and he had two vertical gashes on his head			1
@entity10 's family and the special prosecutor appointed to investigate the case have rejected @entity21 's self - defense claim , saying they believe @entity21 disobeyed the police dispatcher who advised him to stop following @entity10 , racially profiled him and unjustly killed him			1
the case has also shined a hot spotlight on the city of @entity2 , and particularly interracial relations in the community			2
@entity83 , for one , said monday that reports of gaping rifts in @entity2 along racial lines have been vastly overstated , adding , " i do n't think @entity2 needs healing			2
" and @entity77 , the other dissenting commissioner , blamed outsiders for fanning the flames			0
" it is not @entity2 residents who created this firestorm , " he said			0
" it was brought in from the outside			0
" @entity0 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
