-- once the ultimate power couple in @entity2 , @entity3 and his wife @entity4 have now vanished			1
@entity3 has been stripped of his top @entity6 posts for unspecified " serious violations of discipline , " while @entity4 has been detained in connection with the death of @entity11 , a @entity12 businessman			1
the scandal has rocked the @entity2 leadership to the core			1
but weeks after the shocking news of the couple 's fall from grace broke , little substantiated information has come out			2
it has mostly been rumor and speculation			0
some people at the center of the story have been silenced			0
others have been locked up			0
inside murder mystery hotel but one insider who has dared to speak is @entity28 , a self - described " independent thinker , " who seems to move in and outside @entity6 circles			1
born and bred in @entity31 , a sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million where @entity3 served as party chief for four years , @entity28 , 64 , knows what makes the city tick			1
in recent weeks , while @entity2 's official media have remained tight - lipped on the @entity3 scandal , @entity28 has talked with numerous overseas media , revealing tales of scandal , blackmail , murder and arrests			1
' party boy ' son hits back at allegations " i know i 'm taking a little risk by agreeing to take your interview , " @entity28 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			1
" but what i 'm saying is basically in line with the central government			0
several foreign media told me they could n't find one single interviewee in the vast city of @entity31			0
they dare not sound off their opinion			0
" @entity28 acknowledged he is not personally familiar with @entity3			1
he met him only once many years ago , before @entity3 moved to @entity31			2
but he boasts a network of " guanxi " ( connections ) -- academics , writers , journalists , businessmen and officials -- some of whom claim to have knowledge of the @entity3 scandal			1
@entity2 enters internet ' battlefield ' over @entity3 " i 'm stronger at analyzing , " he said			1
" as for the truth , many other people know much more about it than i do			0
" still , @entity28 talked expansively about the unfolding political scandal			1
he said @entity3 portrayed himself as a modern - day @entity77			2
" @entity3 borrowed @entity77 's ideology as the core of his own governing , " he said			2
" but going back to @entity77 's path was definitely not an option			0
it was a dead - end			0
" @entity3 's campaign of smashing gangs and reviving communist , @entity77 - era songs -- " smash black , sing red , " as he called it -- caused a lot of damage in @entity31 , according to @entity28			1
" extortion of confessions through torture was commonplace , " he added			0
" too many unjust and mistaken cases were made in the process			0
" why did @entity3 seem to enjoy public support ? " he gained some support from a certain crowd , which is pathetic , " @entity28 opined			1
" @entity100 did n't conduct a thorough reform to erase @entity77 's impact , and the opening up [ of @entity2 's economy ] has led to a huge rich - poor gap and enormous corruption in the @entity6			1
" it 's natural that some people would want to go back to the egalitarian @entity77 era because @entity100 brought back capitalism which some people did n't welcome			0
" @entity3 gained support in @entity31 in part because @entity114 never effectively reformed its political system , " he claimed			2
what about @entity3 's ties to @entity11 ? was he a @entity12 spy ? " personally i do n't think @entity11 was a spy , " he said without elaborating			1
the @entity2 - based businessman reportedly moved in the orbit of a company known as @entity122 , a @entity12 strategic information consultancy formed by former officers of the @entity12 's spy agency @entity125			1
@entity126 recently released a statement saying : " @entity11 had a long history of advising western companies on @entity2 and we were among those who sought his advice			2
we are greatly saddened by his death			0
" meanwhile , @entity28 expressed doubts @entity3 was involved in @entity11 's murder			1
" if it 's like what was reported , that @entity3 was shocked on learning of @entity11 's murder , he may not have been involved previously but may have tried to hide or minimize its impact , " @entity28 said			1
as for @entity3 's wife , @entity28 noted official @entity2 reports allege @entity4 may have been complicit in @entity11 's death			1
" as for her motive , i think it 's either struggling over financial interests or disagreements related to their personal affair , " he said			0
" it somehow became impossible for @entity4 to end this relationship with @entity11			0
my guess is both factors exist			0
they were involved both financially and romantically			0
" was @entity3 involved in corruption and bribery ? @entity28 could not say for sure			1
" i do n't know whether he 's interested in money , but my understanding of politicians of his kind is they are not impressed much by money , maybe by women -- think about @entity162 or @entity77 -- but by power , " he said			0
" money is a significant factor nowadays , for sure , but i do n't know about @entity3 's attitude on this			2
" @entity28 then proffered lessons that could be learned from the @entity3 saga			1
@entity2 , he said , needs political reform			2
" @entity3 is not so extreme , he is still reasonable , " he said			2
" if some @entity172 like those online bloggers of ' @entity174 ' came to power , it 'll be a disaster			0
this is what we can learn from the @entity3 case : start political reform immediately and return power to people			2
" another lesson , he said , comes from censorship			0
" the lack of free flow of information and expression channels are blinding people , " he explained			0
" ' rumors stop at the wise mind ' , an old @entity2 saying says			2
in modern days they stop when there are open channels , media freedom and transparency			0
" as the hour - long interview came to a conclusion , @entity28 declined to speculate on the outcome of the @entity3 scandal			1
he said only the main characters in this saga can possibly know more -- the deceased @entity11 , @entity4 and @entity3 himself .			0

@entity3 stripped of his top @entity6 posts for unspecified " serious violations of discipline "
his wife , @entity210 , detained in connection with the death of a @entity12 businessman
the scandal has stunned @entity2 's *hierarchy* , but little substantiated facts have come out
@entity28 says he has taken a risk by revealing what he knows about the @entity3 family
