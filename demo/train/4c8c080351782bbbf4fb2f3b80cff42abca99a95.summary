editor 's note : @entity2 is director of the @entity3 and a professor at @entity5			1
he also serves as special advisor to @entity8 secretary general @entity7 on the @entity9			0
from 2002 to 2006 , he was director of the @entity11			0
he is president and co-founder of @entity13 , a nonprofit organization aimed at ending extreme global poverty and achieving the @entity9			0
he has twice been named among the 100 most influential leaders in the world by @entity17 and is the author of the bestsellers " @entity20 " and " @entity21			0
" @entity2 says the @entity23 countries must take steps to cushion the poor from the financial crisis			1
( @entity27 ) -- the @entity23 meeting in @entity29 , @entity30 , on april 2 will be watched by the entire world with urgency and with a yearning for hope , vision and programmatic clarity			1
the preparatory work is not adequate			0
the @entity23 discussions do not move sufficiently beyond financial regulation			1
i would like to suggest the following main points for @entity23 leadership in the global recovery			1
the @entity23 needs to combine stimulus , economic development and sustainability : stimulus to get the world recession reversed , development to ensure that all of the world ( not merely the rich countries or the @entity23 ) shares in the benefits , and sustainability to address the world 's grave risks of climate change , water stress and loss of biodiversity			1
the world 's 3 billion poor , especially the 1 billion poorest of the poor , are suffering powerful and destabilizing blows from the crisis , and these will get worse and threaten global security unless there is specific attention and action			1
the @entity23 can not limit its focus to regulating the financial sector , reforming the @entity71 and the @entity72 , avoiding protectionism and reciting the measures that individual countries are taking			1
this would leave the world gasping for direction and hope			0
the @entity23 must offer a vision that is big enough to quell global fears and action bold enough to protect the desperately poor while guiding the cooperative decision - making of the world 's economic authorities			1
the @entity86 must push forward based on real policy coordination			2
the world does not have a system of effective cooperation			0
the @entity92 , for example , does not engage in comprehensive and deep coordination with other countries			2
the poor countries , with half the world 's population , and the poorest countries , with roughly one - fifth of the world 's population , have not been brought into the equation			1
the @entity23 package for stimulus should include : first , fulfillment by all countries of stimulus measures already announced and a commitment to undertake new joint stimulus measures , especially priority public outlays on infrastructure , the social safety net and sustainable energy , as may be needed during the coming years			1
second , establishment of a high - level g - 20 coordination group , backed especially by @entity115 , the @entity116 , @entity117 and the @entity92 , to work full - time on coordinating monetary , fiscal and financial policies for stimulus and long - term recovery			1
such cooperative macroeconomic programming does not now exist			0
third , increased currency support extended from the world 's five major central banks ( the @entity124 , the @entity126 , the @entity127 , the @entity128 and the @entity129 ) for emerging market economies facing the loss of loans from international banks ( e.g. @entity134 )			1
the @entity124 's currency swap lines to @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 last fall played an important stabilizing role			0
the other central banks can and should do more , as can the @entity124 vis - Ã  - vis other countries			0
fourth , a @entity86 commitment to gradual and orderly currency readjustments to help rebalance the world 's financial and trade flows			1
the @entity150 currencies should gradually appreciate against the euro , which in turn should appreciate gradually against the dollar			0
squabbling about bilateral rates between the dollar and @entity115 renmenbi should be put to rest			0
@entity23 actions for the poor should include : first , establishment of an urgent special food security program , which would make grants to low - income , food - deficit countries ( including @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and elsewhere ) to ensure that impoverished farmers can get the basic input they need ( such as fertilizer and high - yield seeds ) to grow more food			1
@entity8 secretary - general @entity7 and @entity174 's prime minister @entity173 have joined to propose this new program and have mobilized backing from about a dozen countries			0
the @entity92 ' contribution should be at least $ 200 million per year over five years ( $ 1 billion total ) , matching @entity174 , the largest donor country , and sending a powerful message of solidarity from the @entity92 to the world			1
the hunger crisis is now afflicting 1 billion people and contributing to the deaths of millions of children each year			2
second , full funding of the @entity189 , which is facing a critical and potentially devastating cash shortfall during 2009 - 11			0
an incremental @entity92 contribution of $ 350 million in 2009 would close the most urgent cash - flow gap and put the @entity92 in the clear lead of protecting the @entity189 and championing the fight against the three pandemic diseases			2
third , special urgent long - term financing of clean energy investments in the poor countries , especially solar , geothermal , wind and hydro , as a direct stimulus to the supplier countries ( including the @entity92 ) , a development boost for the recipient countries ( notably in @entity165 and @entity207 ) and a major spur to climate control and success in negotiations this year			1
fourth , accelerated distribution by the @entity72 and the regional development banks of their unused financing capacities , directed at infrastructure and the @entity9			0
the @entity23 would commit to accelerate the replenishment of those funds on an expedited and as - needed basis			2
fifth , urgently completing the pending injection of capital for regional development banks to bolster their lending and grants			0
( the @entity226 , for example , is in the process of a recapitalization , which should be strongly supported by the @entity92 and the rest of the @entity23			1
) sixth , an urgent easing of the conditions the @entity71 sets on its grants and loans to poor countries			0
this will ensure that those countries can receive and utilize greatly increased @entity71 financial backing to preserve trade finance and to have the room to undertake needed stimulus measures			0
@entity243 , an explicit commitment by all parties to take the steps needed to achieve the @entity9 by 2015 , the world 's internationally agreed goals to fight extreme poverty , hunger and disease			1
( see http://www.milleniumpromise.org for details and ways to achieve them			0
) all parties should underscore their commitments to the goals , and the @entity92 should emphasize its resolve to increase aid markedly by 2015			2
@entity86 actions for sustainability should include : first , a determination to " green " the stimulus in each country and to expand the development financing for sustainable infrastructure in the developing world , including solar power and efficient water use in @entity165			2
second , a commitment to reach a climate agreement in @entity271 , @entity272 , which will steer large - scale investments in sustainable energy , next - generation automobiles , green buildings and so forth as a key plank of global recovery			2
follow - up i recommend that the @entity92 offer to host the next @entity23 meeting in september in advance of the @entity282			1
@entity115 would be a logical host for the fourth g - 20 meeting during early 2010			0
to enhance global coverage and legitimacy , the @entity86 should be enlarged to be the @entity287 , to include representation of @entity289 and @entity290			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : when @entity86 meets , it must do more than just financial regulation
he says the world 's 3 billion poor are suffering from global economic crisis
sachs : @entity302 needs food security plan for poor nations with aid from @entity92 , others
he says *health* and clean energy should be key priorities for the @entity23
