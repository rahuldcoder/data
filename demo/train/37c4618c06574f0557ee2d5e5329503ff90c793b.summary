-- he was one of a wave of @entity4 businessman to invest in an @entity6 club , but eight years down the line a weary @entity7 has beaten a retreat			1
@entity7 completed a Â £ 62.6 million ( $ 105.7 million ) takeover of @entity11 from @entity12 back in 2006 -- one year after @entity13 won control of @entity15 , and one year before @entity16 and @entity17 bought @entity18			1
yet despite enjoying early success at @entity20 with the club securing three straight sixth - place finishes under former manager @entity23 , the 52 - year - old has had to watch on in recent seasons as the team have struggled in the bottom half of the table			0
the former owner of @entity32 team , the @entity29 hinted last month that he was considering his position amid reports that a sale was imminent			0
and he confirmed monday that he has " engaged @entity36 to advise on the club 's sale " as he seeks a much - needed break from the world of football			1
" i have come to know well that fates are fickle in the business of @entity46 football , " @entity7 said in an official statement			2
" the last several seasons have been week in , week out battles and having now come through this last season unfortunately limping amidst very meaningful injuries and constant sale rumors , i feel further that now is the time for me to look for new ownership and thus new leadership			0
" he added : " on a personal level it is time for me , like the @entity57 , to dwell among my own and get on with other aspects of my career , following a sale			0
" much of @entity11 's success under @entity23 was aided by @entity7 's willingness to invest millions on new players , such as @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
however , after ultimately being unable to break into the top four of the @entity6 and secure @entity69 football , the @entity4 has had to embark on a cost - cutting program in recent seasons -- selling star players to rival clubs , including @entity64 to @entity15 in 2011 and @entity65 to @entity74 in 2010			1
the team 's decline has led to some criticism of both @entity7 's running of the club as well as the managers who have followed @entity23 -- @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			2
@entity7 , though , is still grateful for the backing he has received from the majority of the club 's supporters , while he is hoping @entity11 will go from strength to strength after his departure			1
" i am appreciative of the support i have received , even in these last years of comparative struggle when criticism was due , and will look on with others -- with fingers crossed , for stronger future performance appropriate to our size and heritage , " he said			0
@entity7 added : " above all , the debt i owe @entity11 whether as owner , chairman , custodian or simply as a fan is to put the club first			1
to make good on that debt , i owe it to @entity11 to move on , and look for fresh , invigorated leadership , if in my heart i feel i can no longer do the job			0
" while @entity7 thanked @entity83 for his efforts as manager since arriving in 2012 , he did not mention the @entity114 's future			0
@entity83 may be disposed by the new owners following a disappointing season that culminated with the club finishing 15th			0
@entity7 's likely asking price for the club will be in the region of Â £ 200 million ( $ 337.7 million ) , according to reports in the @entity123 media .			2
