@entity0 looks like he could have stepped out of the pages of one of his own best - selling @entity4 novels			1
he 's a tall man in cowboy boots , a pearl snap shirt and a 10 - gallon hat , carrying a leather satchel			2
with the late - day sun behind him , he could even pass for his fictional hero , sheriff @entity11			1
there are some similarities between the writer and his subject , and readers have been known to confuse the two			2
both men are ranchers in @entity18 , although @entity11 is from the fictional @entity19 while @entity0 lives in the very real town of @entity21 , population 25			1
both have a history in law enforcement : @entity0 worked briefly in the field long ago , while @entity11 is a legendary lawman among crime fiction readers			1
in reality , @entity0 dreamed up @entity11 years ago in his first novel , 2004 's " @entity30			1
" eight years and eight best - selling books later , both men are still going strong			2
@entity0 's newest , " @entity35 , " debuted on the @entity34 bestseller list last week			1
this time out , @entity11 and his close friend @entity37 are drawn into a murder investigation after they see a young @entity41 woman fall to her death on the @entity44 reservation			1
@entity0 's @entity4 crime novels have long been a favorite of critics and fans			1
now , they 're about to reach a whole new audience on cable television			1
@entity52 has adapted @entity0 's creation into the new series " @entity11 , " premiering sunday			1
currently on a national promotional tour , the author sat down with @entity57 to talk about his new book , the tv series and life in @entity18			1
the following is an edited transcript : @entity57 : " @entity11 " is about to premiere on tv			1
how involved have you been with the show ? @entity0 : it 's been a real surprise			1
generally , what happens is , @entity69 writes you a check and says , " see you later			1
" my situation has been a little bit different			2
i was asked to be an executive creative consultant on the show			2
i bounced back and forth with the writers on ideas for the show			2
then they sent me the first screenplay for the pilot episode			2
i went through it , and i made something like 57 changes and sent it back to them , and out of the 57 changes , they made 55 of them			2
so it 's been very hands - on and very responsive			2
they 've kept me in the loop the whole time			2
i was on set for three weeks while they were filming the pilot			2
i was very lucky and have been working with really good people			2
it 's been an amazing process			0
@entity57 : it seems the tv series is bringing you wider exposure and new fans			1
@entity0 : it seems like it with the book sales			1
the crowds at book signings are larger			0
for me , it 's all about the exposure for the books			0
i live in @entity21 , @entity18			1
i have a little ranch there			0
that 's where i was when @entity69 found me , and that 's where i 'll be when @entity69 leaves me			0
to be honest , i do n't have any great want or need to move to @entity115 or anything like that			0
i like my life , and i really love writing the books			0
if someone had asked me if i would have had as much fun writing the eighth or ninth book in the series as i did the first one , i would n't have thought that was possible , but it is			2
i 'm having more fun now , because i feel like i 've written enough to think i kind of know what i 'm doing			0
at least , i hope so			0
@entity57 : @entity11 has changed a great deal over the course of eight books			1
have you changed your approach to writing them ? @entity0 : one of the things that 's very important to me in the books is the characters have to change			1
they have to have things happen to them			0
you ca n't keep them in a stasis and try and write formulaic books			0
i think some of the best stories i 've ever heard in my life have been when i 've been sitting on a porch sitting in a rocking chair snapping green beans or out on a hunting camp looking over a fire at a guy who starts out , " let me tell you what happened to me last month			0
" i really love that old - fashioned style of storytelling			0
there may have been a time with crime fiction when just writing a whodunnit was enough			2
a lot of readers come to crime fiction with the same expectations they have for literary fiction			2
they want fully developed characters , they want an arc of storyline , they want social commentary , they want humor , they want history , and they want to know who did it by the time they get to the end			0
so that kind of raises the bar up to a level where it makes the books much more worth writing , to be honest with you			0
if i was just trying to find clever ways of killing people that would get really boring really quick			0
i 'm lucky to be doing what i 'm doing			0
@entity57 : i think one of the things your readers really appreciate is your realistic portrayal of life on the " rez			0
" @entity0 : my ranch is up on the @entity18 / @entity202 border at the base of the @entity204			1
due north is the @entity44 reservation , slightly to the west is the @entity41 reservation , down to the southwest we have the @entity211 and the @entity212 , and then due east and a little to the south we 've got the @entity214			0
so we 're surrounded by these sovereign nations			0
for me , that 's part of where i live , and to leave that out would be , excuse the term , criminal			0
i think whenever you 're writing about a place or a people , if it 's something you care deeply about , then the one thing you owe them is honesty			0
that means you ca n't just sugarcoat it			0
you have to be as honest as you can about the people , about the place , about everything			0
whether it 's the rampant alcoholism or unemployment or educational problems			0
@entity57 : many of your readers believe @entity11 is real			1
some think you and @entity11 are really the same person			1
how much do you share in common with your lead character ? @entity0 : the best quote about that is from my wife			1
she says , " @entity11 is who @entity0 would like to be in 10 years , but he 's off to an incredibly slow start			1
" @entity11 's a much better person than i 'll ever be , but he has his faults , too			1
i tend to refer to @entity11 as over			1
he 's overweight , he 's overage , he 's overly depressed , but he still goes out and gets the job done			0
if there 's one thing i underestimated when i was putting him together , it 's the empathy , the sympathy that people have heaped upon this guy and how much they would care			0
it 's very flattering that people are that concerned about the characters			0
and it 's true , women give me love notes to give to @entity11			1
i get a lot of veterans and a lot of law enforcement people that give me challenge coins and say , " if you could pass that on to @entity11 , i would really appreciate it			1
" people think this guy 's real			0
my gosh , i think that 's the highest praise a writer could ever possibly get			0
