@entity0 -- among the volumes of diplomatic communications released by @entity4 are frank observations about the character of world leaders , their quirks and their weaknesses			0
in an initial review of the documents turns up a number of observations from @entity15 staffers that provide unusual insight into foreign leaders ' thinking and behavior , from " voluptuous " companions to attention - seeking personalities			2
@entity24 's @entity23 proposed to @entity15 officials that a @entity27 - like device be implanted in @entity29 detainees			1
during a march 22 , 2009 , meeting between deputy national security adviser @entity32 and @entity23 , the king suggested that an " electronic chip " would allow the tracking of the detainees ' movements , as with @entity24 horses and falcons			1
@entity32 deflected the idea , saying that " ' horses do n't have good lawyers ' and that such a proposal would face legal hurdles in the @entity15 " another communication dated february 10 said the @entity24 king " tends to express himself tersely " because of his lifelong struggle with a " speech impediment " but added that he is a " wry and forthright interlocutor			1
" the foibles of @entity51 's leader get a lot of attention in a cable from the @entity55 in @entity56			1
under the subject line " a glimpse into @entity51 leader [ @entity69 's ] eccentricities , " there is an extensive discussion of his " various proclivities and phobias " and his almost obsessive reliance on his nurse , a woman described as a " voluptuous blonde			1
" the document goes on to detail the relationship between the 38 - year - old @entity73 nurse , @entity74 , and @entity69 , touching on rumors of a romantic relationship			2
it also discusses the lengths the @entity51 leader will go to ensure that @entity74 travels with him , saying that only she " knows his routine			1
" the cable says @entity69 is " almost obsessively dependent on a small core of trusted personnel			0
" also among his quirks : @entity69 's dislike of flying long distances , his fear of flying over water and his need to stay on the first floor of any building			0
these diplomatically embarrassing cables extend beyond the @entity95 and @entity96			0
they include observations from around the world , including @entity100 and longtime allies @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			2
of @entity103 president @entity105 , one cable gave this open assessment : " an activist on the international scene , with an opportunistic eye for grabbing attention and credit , @entity105 will remain a challenging partner despite his desire to improve the bilateral relationship			1
" some news outlets have reported that @entity15 diplomats called @entity105 an " emperor with no clothes			1
" on @entity104 's prime minister @entity121 and his relationship with @entity123 : the @entity104 leader " appears increasingly to be the mouthpiece of [ prime minister @entity126 ] @entity125 , " according to a report from the @entity129			1
regarding @entity102 chancellor @entity130 : " when cornered , @entity130 can be tenacious but is risk - averse and rarely creative			0
this suggests she will remain a very circumspect ally until the election			0
" although these cables may provide the @entity15 with some uncomfortable moments with global partners , they are not limited to foreign leaders			2
@entity15 officials are also a topic of discussion			0
an almost prescient communication dated february 10 talks about the fallout from gen. @entity150 's interview with the @entity102 news outlet @entity152 ; four months later , his controversial interview with @entity145 was published , and he was forced to resign as head of the mission in @entity155			1
@entity102 foreign minister @entity156 asked to express his concerns " confidentially " about @entity150 's interview			2

@entity156 recounted that he himself had to answer questions about this article for 10 days , explaining that the @entity102 were not ' peace soldiers ' while other countries provided combat troops			0
" @entity156 went on to stress that it was " important that @entity102 troops not be ' relativized ' and cast as second - class troops			0
