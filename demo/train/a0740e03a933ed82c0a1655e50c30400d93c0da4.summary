@entity0 -- @entity2 is in his first year at a kindergarten in @entity0 and seems like an especially gifted child			1
that 's because his parents say he can communicate in three languages			2
he is three years old			0
since he was ten months old , his mother , @entity8 , has been taking him to a language center five times a week where he is taught to listen , speak and interact in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			2
he attends a language school in the city that offers courses for children as young as a few months old			2
some parents will even pay a tutor to speak in a particular language for an hour in the belief their baby will absorb this			2
this is just one of the many examples of how parents in @entity0 are trying to get ahead of the game by giving their children a competitive edge in the race for limited school places			1
with a large expatriate community and an increase in mainland @entity37 parents wishing to send their kids across the border to school , @entity0 's world class educational system is under siege with applications			1
and this pressure is being felt by parents , many of whom are starting early and going to extraordinary lengths to outshine thousands of other applicants for limited pre-school opportunities , believing it will give them an advantage when it comes to securing a primary school place			1
queuing for places at this time of the year , parents go into a frenzy queuing for application forms at schools across @entity0			1
in the city 's northern district , which borders @entity37 , @entity0 and mainland parents have even camped out overnight to get their hands on the right admission forms			1
according to @entity68 in the city 's @entity66 district , around 2,000 people queued up to apply for only 240 available spaces on october 7 -- police were even called in to deal with complaints about people cutting the queue			1
there has also been growing animosity towards mainland parents , with local people arguing children living in @entity0 should be given priority over places			1
cross-border students , or children living in @entity37 who have gained the right of abode and free education in @entity0 by birth , often travel up to five hours to go to school			1
currently , the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) in @entity0 estimates the number of cross-border students to be 17,000 , with around half that number enrolled in kindergarten or day care centers			1
early planning in @entity0 , where formal pre-school education begins at the age of three , many prospective parents begin mapping out education plans before their children are born			1
@entity2 , an expat mother living in @entity0 , revealed she started looking for potential kindergartens and playgroups during her pregnancy			1
" in @entity0 , if you do n't get into a good pre-nursery or kindergarten , it 's really difficult to get into a good primary school , that 's why you already have to have a plan when you are pregnant			1
" after attending numerous information sessions and preschool open days , she applied to a playgroup when she was eight months pregnant because the waiting list was already around a year			0
another mother , who preferred not to be named , said parents scour online education forums to identify the top popular school choices			2
" it 's the only topic that comes up when you go out for lunch , which school your kid got into , which school are you applying for and how are you preparing your child for it ? " she said			0
" my friends have sent me spreadsheets with a detailed timetable of when schools are available for applications and how to apply			2
" pressure to perform the stress does n't end there for parents			2
some have even signed up their children for mock interview training so they would be able to perform well during kindergarten interviews			1
" some playgroup teachers who are familiar with the interview process in certain famous kindergartens , will help train the child to overcome shyness and get used to answering questions from strangers , " explained the unnamed mother			2
she recalled one of the interviews she took her son to , when he was only 18 months old			0
" they ( the children ) were in a room with six to seven other kids with the parents sitting behind them			1
the teacher would ask them to point to an object in the picture or ask what color it is			0
some kids did n't respond , or started crying and they would just have to move on to the next kid , " she said			0
" the whole thing lasted for seven minutes			0
i do n't know what criteria they base their admissions on , but it 's hard to figure out a kid at one and a half years old			0
" this comes as no surprise to @entity170 , principal of the @entity171 at @entity172			0
" we 've received cvs of little babies and portfolios listing their many talents , " she said			0
" parents are proud of their children , and they want the best for them			1
" while parents see interviews as a make or break moment for their children , @entity182 says there is no need for parents to panic			1
" many of the schools are competitive , but it 's not about how perfect their child is , all children are special , " she said			2
" we also look at families to see if they 're congruent with our philosophy			0
it 's not how well they can perform , but the relationship between home and school is really important too , " she added			0
finding the best fit even after parents manage to successfully enroll their child in a kindergarten , the unnamed mother adds that they are constantly on the lookout for better schools			1
" parents in @entity0 have the dilemma in choosing between local and international schools			1
i have friends who send their kids to a local kindergarten in the morning , and then an international kindergarten in the afternoon			2
so they 'll nap or eat lunch in the car			0
they think both systems are flawed , but they want to get the best of both worlds			0
" meanwhile , @entity2 's son , @entity223 , takes a nap after attending school in the morning and the @entity226 afterwards			0
" i 'm half @entity13 and half @entity37 , and my husband is half @entity228 and half @entity229			0
we wanted him to speak all the languages and it 's convenient because it 's all in one center , " she said			0
" we 've stayed in the language center for more than two years , and for him it 's for fun			0
i asked him this week if he wanted to go to @entity243 or the language center and he said ' i want to go see this teacher and that teacher			0
' he really enjoys it , " she added .			0
