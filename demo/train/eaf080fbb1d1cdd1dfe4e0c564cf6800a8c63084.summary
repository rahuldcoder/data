-- for almost 90 years , the casket lay beneath the earth , @entity4 's family believing the teen who died too young rested in peace there , in an unmarked plot with his great - grandparents			1
@entity4 was a charge of @entity11 , @entity13 's @entity12 , a now infamous juvenile detention facility that closed in 2011 for budgetary reasons , capping a chilling , 111 - year legacy of brutality			1
from 1900 to 1952 , according to a court document , 100 boys died there , but only about half were buried on the reform institution 's grounds			2
others were shipped home to their families			0
@entity4 , 17 , became part of that tally in 1925 when he died " under suspicious circumstances while escaping @entity29 twenty - nine days after arriving , " says the court order permitting his exhumation this week			1
the coroner at the time ruled @entity4 's manner of death was unknown			1
the ledger entry at the @entity29 school said he was " killed on @entity38 , @entity13 " another document at @entity40 in @entity41 says he was " killed by train			1
" no one from @entity29 ever reported his death to the state			2
he was returned in a casket to his family , who , in turn , buried him in @entity41			1
or so the family thought			0
it was n't until a state investigation beginning in 2008 that @entity4 's death certificate was found at @entity53			1
it said he died of a crushed skull from an " unknown cause			0
" and it was n't until tuesday , when @entity60 anthropologists who have been working to unearth and identify remains on the former campus visited @entity41 with @entity64 authorities , that the family learned @entity4 was n't in the casket -- no bones , no clothing , no sign of him at all			1
layers of pieces of wood , " said anthropologist @entity71 , explaining what she and her team found in the casket			2
" it was completely filled with wooden planks			0
" at first , the team thought they had the wrong grave , but then they found @entity4 's great - grandparents beneath the wood - filled casket			1
' decades of efforts to deceive ' @entity71 was still incredulous wednesday , as was cpl. @entity86 of the @entity87 , who along with @entity41 assistant district attorney @entity88 , was instrumental in clearing the path for @entity71 's team to exhume @entity4 's remains , she said , " it was a little bit of a shock			1
it was certainly anticlimactic , " @entity86 said			0
" something was shipped up from @entity13 , and it was buried , and someone believed it was @entity4			1
" does he think , as a law enforcement officer , that the finding is indicative of school officials ' intent to deceive @entity4 's family nine decades ago ? " absolutely , " he said , but it 's not surprising when you consider that the investigation into the @entity53 school has uncovered " decades and decades of efforts to deceive , coverups , and not just by one but by many people			1
" @entity86 has been in contact with two of @entity4 's distant cousins , and while they were n't familiar with @entity4 or his death before @entity71 's team began investigating , they 've done what they could to advance the investigation , the police corporal said			1
they 've provided names from their family tree and handwritten notes from their mother			0
one of the cousins , @entity126 , who is 61 and is the granddaughter of @entity4 's mom 's sister , provided dna to identify @entity4 -- had he been found			1
" their interest lies in justice being served , " @entity86 said of the cousins			0
asked where his own interest lies , @entity86 gave a similar answer , but also noted that @entity71 has been an invaluable ally to law enforcement			0
quid pro quo among professionals the ex-chief anthropologist for the @entity140 for the @entity141 , @entity71 has conducted " isotope testing " in her lab to help @entity86 with homicide cases in @entity64			0
for one particularly high - profile case -- a pregnant teen found dismembered in suitcases in 1976 -- @entity71 's team analyzed the woman 's hair and teeth			2
via isotope testing , @entity71 was able to determine where the woman lived based on the water she consumed while alive			0
though police have yet to solve the case , they now know she was born in @entity158 and immigrated to the @entity159 at age 12 , @entity86 said			0
" when she turned to me for assistance , obviously i would 've done anything for her , " @entity86 said of @entity71			0
@entity71 had hoped , of course , that @entity4 's remains would unravel some of the mystery surrounding his death			1
" we went into it trying to answer questions , " she said			0
" what we have is more questions than answers			0
" but the investigation continues			0
now armed with @entity126 's dna , @entity71 's team can return to @entity11 , about 65 miles west of @entity176 , and attempt to match the sample to one of the dozens of bodies that have already been dug up on the 1,400 - acre former campus			2
though many of the boys died so long ago , it 's important to find their family members , @entity71 believes , if only because of the uncertainties surrounding their deaths and the controversy enveloping the supposed school where they died			2
a dubious legacy that bodies lay there was never a secret -- 31 rusty , white crosses marked the resting places of victims who died from a dormitory fire , influenza , pneumonia and other causes -- but @entity71 's team has found a total of 55 bodies there so far			2
her team also has found records indicating that 22 boys who died at the school are unaccounted for			0
already , @entity71 and her colleagues have identified three sets of remains			0
one of those bodies was @entity213 , whose sister @entity214 , 85 , told @entity0 in august she was elated that the seven - decade mystery surrounding her brother 's death was finally solved			0
though ex-students provided detailed accounts of vicious beatings , sexual abuse and disappearances , guards and administrators who are still alive have denied the beatings occurred			1
the state investigation in 2008 and 2009 said there was insufficient evidence of abuse at @entity29 , but dozens of men , many of them now senior citizens , have come forward with stories			1
a support group for ex-students , dubbed the @entity12 , takes its moniker from the structure where boys say they were beaten with a leather strap attached to a wooden handle			2
they were whipped until their underwear was embedded in their buttocks , the @entity12 say			2
crying or screaming out would earn you extra lashes , they say			0
so while this week 's exhumation did n't answer any of the myriad questions surrounding @entity29 and its missing and dead boys , it was still an important part of the ongoing investigation , researchers and police said			1
" it definitely had to be done , " @entity86 said			0
" we had to at least open the grave if this investigation down in @entity13 is going to be resolved			2
" remains of 2 more boys identified at shuttered @entity13 reformatory @entity0 's @entity262 contributed to this report .			1
