@entity0 , @entity1 -- a new theory that @entity9 's " @entity8 " might hide within it a depiction of @entity5 blessing the bread and wine has triggered so much interest that web sites connected to the picture have crashed			1
speculation over hidden meaning in @entity9 's famous fresco has crashed several web sites			1
the famous fresco is already the focus of mythical speculation after author @entity20 based his " the @entity26 " book around the painting , arguing in the novel that @entity5 married his follower , @entity25 , and fathered a child			2
now @entity28 , an information technologist and amateur scholar , says superimposing the " @entity8 " with its mirror - image throws up another picture containing a figure who looks like a @entity36 knight and another holding a small baby			1
" i came across it by accident , from some of the details you can infer that we are not talking about chance but about a precise calculation , " @entity28 told journalists when he unveiled the theory earlier this week			0
websites www.leonardodavinci.tv , www.codicedavinci.tv , www.cenacolo.biz and @entity50 had 15 million hits on thursday morning alone , organizers said , adding they were trying to provide a more powerful server for the sites			0
in the superimposed version , a figure on @entity5 's left appears to be cradling a baby in its arms , @entity28 said , but he made no suggestion this could be @entity5 's child			2
@entity61 , whose imminent betrayal of @entity5 is the force breaking the right - hand line of the original fresco , appears in an empty space on the left in the reverse image version			2
and @entity28 also suggests that the superimposed version shows a goblet before @entity5 and illustrates when @entity5 blessed bread and wine at a supper with his disciples for the first eucharist			0
the original @entity9 depicts @entity5 when he predicts that one among them will betray him			1
