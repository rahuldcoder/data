-- he did n't win , but @entity2 showed why he is still the no. 1 drawcard in golf with a brave bid for victory at the @entity8 tournament sunday			1
he had been tied for the lead after three birdies on his opening nine holes , but a recurrence of his back injury seemed to have scuppered his chances of a sixth @entity17 title this season			1
the @entity19 crumpled to his knees in pain after sending an approach shot into the murky water hazard at 13 , and he registered a bogey before dropping another shot at 15			2
however , he birdied the next two holes to give himself a chance of a playoff against clubhouse leader @entity29 , but his 27 - foot putt from the fringe stopped an inch short of the hole			1
a grim - faced @entity34 received a standing ovation from the gallery crowd at @entity37 in @entity38 , before explaining how his back had gone into " spasm " even before the 13th			2
the problem started before the tournament , caused by a " too soft " mattress at the hotel where he was staying			0
" i had a chance			2
i hit a good putt			0
i thought i made it			0
it was a little double - breaker and i thought i had it , " said the 37 - year - old , who remained top of the @entity54 playoff standings after finishing tied for second with @entity57 winner @entity56 , @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity19 @entity60			2
@entity63 could also have made a playoff , but surprisingly three - putted at the last for bogey and a final round of three - under 68			1
@entity67 also had a chance , but the joint third - round leader could only par as he closed with a disappointing 73			1
@entity58 surged up the leaderboard with a seven - birdie 65 , but it was not enough to beat @entity29 as the @entity73 champion prevailed on 11 - under after a flawless 66 to claim the $ 1.44 million first prize			1
@entity29 , whose caddy @entity75 helped @entity34 to many of his successes , said his turning point had been three late birdies on saturday			1
" i 'd been playing like a dog , " he said			0
" i do n't know if it 's been my best golf since the masters , but i played consistently well to win here			0
" @entity29 , who also had top - five finishes at the @entity86 and @entity87 , moved up to second in the @entity54 standings ahead of the next event in @entity91 -- the @entity92 this coming week , which features the top 100 players			1
@entity95 @entity57 champion @entity94 finished two shots off the @entity97 on 275 following his 65 , which left him tied for sixth with fellow @entity19 @entity100 and @entity101			0
the veteran left - hander moved up to third in the playoff standings			0
@entity104 , who won the tournament in 2010 , dropped back from sharing the third - round lead to a tie for 19th			2
his birdie at the last was mere consolation after a triple - bogey seven at the ninth and five other dropped holes			0
the 35 - year - old slumped to fifth in the standings , from second .			0

@entity29 wins the @entity8 by one shot after a *dramatic* final round
world no. 1 @entity2 ties for second place after a brave effort
he overcomes back spasms to set up chance for playoff
however , as with other *contenders* , @entity2 ' chances end at final hole
