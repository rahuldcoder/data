for more than two weeks , satellites , planes and ships have been deployed to scour huge swathes of ocean for clues relating to the mysterious disappearance of @entity7 and the 239 people on board			1
so far , an area covering 2.97 million square miles -- almost the size of the @entity13 -- has yielded some leads but no proof of where the @entity16 is or what happened to it			1
in the past week , the spotlight has shifted to an expanse of the @entity22 more than 1,500 miles ( 2,400 kilometers ) southwest of @entity23 , triggered by satellite images showing " suspicious " objects floating in the water			1
@entity29 plane spots ' suspicious objects ' we look at some of the hardware involved in this difficult search of one of the most inhospitable corners of the planet			1
satellites @entity29 has had satellite assets deployed in the search for the missing airliner from the early stages of its disappearance -- including the optical earth observation satellite " @entity47 , " which is responsible for the latest images of " suspect objects " floating in the southern @entity22			1
the current southern corridor search was triggered by images from another commercial satellite obtained and analyzed by @entity23 authorities , but identification by aircraft dispatched to identify the objects turned up nothing			1
@entity56 listens for fading pings @entity58 has said it will also deploy space - based assets over the @entity22 such as the @entity56 - observing - 1 ( @entity61 - 1 ) satellite and the remote - controlled @entity63 camera on the @entity64 to acquire images of possible crash sites			1
the resolution of these images could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet ( 30 meters ) or larger			2
the space - sourced information includes more than images : in the past few days @entity72 said data from satellite - generated radar echoes " identified some debris that could be from the @entity77 plane			1
" radar echoes are electronic signals that are sent out and bounce back if contact is made with an object on the surface			0
aircraft reconnaissance aircraft from @entity23 , @entity85 , the @entity13 and @entity29 are currently involved in the search for , and identification of , this ocean - based debris			1
@entity90 initially deployed as a @entity93 - era submarine hunter in the 1960s , @entity91 's @entity90 is a mainstay of many modern air forces			0
a number of upgraded variants are being used in the search for @entity7 , including the @entity90 ( @entity100 ) @entity101 ( @entity102 ) , @entity103 ( @entity85 @entity104 ) and p - @entity105 ( @entity106 ) the p - 3 's long - range , long - loiter capability -- it can remain in the air for up to 16 hours -- has made it the benchmark for maritime patrol aircraft -- and perfect for this type of search			1
sophisticated sensors on board the aircraft can detect sound 1,000 feet ( 304 meters ) below the water 's surface , while it can fly just 200 feet ( 60 meters ) above the water			1
@entity121 a new addition to the @entity100 's arsenal , the @entity121 from @entity122 is arguably the world 's most sophisticated anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft			2
it is being phased in as the replacement for the @entity90 in the @entity100			0
built on the reliable @entity122 airframe , the @entity121 has a maximum speed of 490 knots , can fly up to 41,000 feet ( 12,496 meters ) and can cover more than 1,200 nautical miles in four hours , according to the @entity100			2
for the @entity7 search , the @entity121 will typically fly at 5,000 feet ( 1,524 meters ) , dipping to 1,000 feet to get a closer visual look at objects , the @entity100 said			1
they will typically fly at a speed of 250 - 270 knots , with a search time of eight to nine hours depending on the distance to the search area			2
according to the @entity100 , the @entity121 's advanced radar capabilities allow its crew to recognize and investigate small contacts on the water 's surface			0
the crew can also use an onboard camera system , as well as a multitude of sensors , to investigate contacts			0
@entity149 the @entity150 has deployed two @entity152 - made @entity149 aircraft to join the search			2
the four - engine , medium - range giant can be used as a commercial freighter or military transporter , able to carry heavy payloads such as vehicles and other outsized cargo via its ramp			0
it has a maximum speed of 458 knots and a ceiling of 39,370 feet ( 12,000 meters )			0
the @entity166 also has an @entity167 ( @entity168 ) for dropping cargo and other equipment while in flight -- something that may be useful if a crash site is found			0
get up to speed surface ships and equipment a @entity29 icebreaker -- which was involved in the rescue of a @entity152 research vessel stuck in the @entity181 ice earlier this year -- has now changed course and is steaming towards the location where the latest debris has been spotted in the southern @entity22			1
the helicopter - carrying @entity188 -- or @entity190 -- is expected to arrive in the search area on tuesday , and has a " good knowledge " of the area , @entity185 , deputy director of the @entity187 's polar expedition office , told @entity29 's state - run @entity195 news agency			2
@entity197 's @entity196 has also dispatched a coastal survey ship , @entity199 , to join the search			0
launched in 2002 , @entity199 was designed to carry out a wide range of survey work , including support to submarine and amphibious operations , through the collection of oceanographic and bathymetric -- analysis of the ocean , its salinity and sound profile -- data , according to the @entity196			0
the @entity100 's @entity213 has been a major contributor to the search from the get - go , providing ships , aircraft and considerable technical know - how			1
in addition to air operations , the fleet has deployed surface ships equipped with sophisticated search capabilities			2
as a precautionary measure in case a debris field is located , the fleet is moving a " black box " locator into the region -- which would provide a significant advantage in locating the missing aircraft 's own flight data recorder , according to commander @entity234 , spokesperson for the @entity213			0
according to @entity234 , the " @entity239 " is able to locate black boxes on downed @entity100 and commercial aircraft down to a maximum depth of 20,000 feet ( 6,096 meters ) anywhere in the world			0
the @entity240 is towed behind a vessel at slow speeds , generally from 1 - 5 knots depending on the depth			0
the tow " fish " carries a passive listening device for detecting pingers that automatically transmit an acoustic pulse .			0

the more than two - week search for @entity7 has covered an area the size of the @entity13
satellites have been providing images of " suspicious " surface objects
a number of nations have sent reconnaissance aircraft to southern @entity22
the @entity77 @entity122 *777* " vanished " on march 8 with 239 people on board
