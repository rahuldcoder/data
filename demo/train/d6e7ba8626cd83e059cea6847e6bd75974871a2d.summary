-- more than a quarter - million @entity2 women served honorably in the @entity4 and @entity5 wars			1
these brave women sacrificed much to keep us safe			0
now that they are home , or soon to be home , our country has a solemn obligation to help them transition back to civilian life			1
yet there is mounting evidence that @entity2 is not fulfilling this obligation			2
based on data gathered by the @entity23 and defense departments , a recent report by @entity20 finds it clear that our country is n't fully meeting the unique physical , emotional and employment needs of women who served in uniform			1
although they served in equal capacities in combat environments , when they return home they receive less support than their male counterparts from government programs primarily designed for men			1
today , nearly one in five women who are veterans have delayed or gone without necessary health care in the past year			1
one in 11 is unemployed			0
former servicewomen experience homelessness at between two to four times the rate of their civilian counterparts			0
it 's unacceptable that the women who honorably served our countryâ € ” our mothers , spouses , sisters and daughtersâ € ” are at risk			2
the @entity20 report finds that the federal , state and community programs to support women making the transition out of military service have serious gaps that put some of them in jeopardy			2
today , one - third of the @entity23 medical centers lack a staff gynecologist and 18 % of @entity23 clinics have yet to hire at least one doctor specializing in women 's health			1
mental health services for women are severely lacking			1
twenty percent of female patients in the @entity23 health system have been diagnosed with a condition resulting from military sexual trauma , which can have devastating , long - term consequences			1
nonetheless , one in three @entity23 health centers does not have enough sexual trauma specialists on staff			2
sadly , we are not doing much better when it comes to helping women gain post-military employment			0
former servicewomen are highly skilled , with unique life experiences that give them valuable leadership qualities and the know - how to operate effectively in high - stress situations			2
yet the unemployment rate for female veterans has steadily climbed for most of the past decade , and is now higher than for male veterans			0
what 's more , two - thirds of women report that the career service help offered by federal agencies has been sub- par. these problems could soon get worse			2
the military has started on a major drawdown of personnel			0
as a result , more than 200,000 servicewomen are expected to rejoin the civilian workforce in the next five years			0
now is the time for action			0
in our report , " women veterans : the @entity120 , " @entity20 outlines 27 key policy and program recommendations that @entity113 , the administration , @entity23 and the @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117 can take to strengthen the safety net for female veterans			1
for starters , veterans ' health centers must meet their obligation to provide specialists in women 's health			2
at a minimum , every @entity23 medical center must hire a gynecologist			0
and efforts to treat and help stamp out sexual assault within the military need to be expanded			0
officials must intensify their efforts to change any remnants of a culture that comes at the expense of women 's dignity and safety			0
to help combat unemployment among female veterans , the @entity141 must take a hard look at the primary program designed to help veterans go into the civilian labor force : the @entity148			1
the department does not collect data on participation , satisfaction , and outcomes by gender and race			0
simply put , the @entity141 can not tell us if the @entity148 actually helps female veterans find jobs			2
also , the @entity23 and @entity141 need to develop career guidance programs specially designed for women			1
finally , as the @entity163 work to strengthen services to servicewomen , these agencies need to invest in improved child care options			1
inadequate child care is proving to be a major obstacle for many women transitioning home			1
for example , many are unable to take part in specialized mental health services , such as post-traumatic stress disorder support groups , because child care is unavailable			1
thousands of women answered the call of duty and put themselves at risk to preserve our nation 's security			0
they served this country faithfully			0
serving them with greater respect , consideration and care must become a national priority .			0

a quarter - million @entity2 women served in @entity4 , @entity5 and are returning to civilian life
@entity193 : they served in combat like men , but get less support than men do
he says female vets go without health care , many are *jobless* , many are homeless
*augustine* : @entity23 and @entity141 need to strengthen services for women , improve child care options
