@entity0 -- less than two weeks remain before the march 31 deadline to apply for the @entity3 and the @entity5 administration is getting creative in reminding @entity6 to sign up by trying to reach every demographic imaginable			1
the administration this month is deploying quirky stunts and niche messaging to reach as many people as possible , including those " young invincibles " considered essential to making the program work economically			2
so far , the administration says it has signed up 5 million people			1
here 's what it 's doing to boost the rolls between now and the end of the month when those who do n't have insurance of any kind would face a fine of $ 95 or 1 % of their income , whichever is higher			2
college basketball fans : as @entity31 " @entity30 " kicks into high gear this week , the @entity28 unveiled its own spin on the popular basketball tournament bracket by unveiling the @entity3 bracket where people can vote on the " 16 sweetest reasons to get covered			1
" get it ? a play on the ncaa tournament " @entity38			0
" a video of @entity44 men 's basketball coach @entity42 and @entity46 women 's coach @entity45 lead off the @entity3 bracket with a video encouraging people to sign up			0
on the online bracket are 16 reasons with corresponding light - hearted gifs			0
for example , the reasons " women ca n't be charged more than men " is combined with a @entity56 of first lady @entity5 slam dunking on @entity59 players			1
that 's paired with the " accidents happen , " with a @entity56 of a woman dressed in spandex and a headband , dancing ridiculously then slipping off a public bathroom countertop			0
cat fans : included on the page are @entity68 of scary cats , adorable cats and random cats			2
there 's also a random electronic @entity73 that throws itself off the shelf because " nobody 's invincible			0
" more college hoops : the administration sees a lot of opportunity with the @entity31 tourney as much of its final outreach is dedicated to the popular sporting event that concludes in early april			2
the @entity28 is also attempting to parlay the popularity of the president 's annual basketball bracket -- a recent tradition that registered the most views of any blog on @entity89 during 2013 -- into tangible enrollments by updating the results of the @entity3 bracket based on the " winning " votes from online users			1
in an effort to reach " tournament fans young and old , " the @entity95 unveiled a report tuesday about the frequency and cost of recreational sports injuries			0
in a blog post , health secretary @entity102 wrote that " a sprained ankle , for example , can cost you $ 2,290 , and charges for a broken arm , for example , average nearly $ 7,700			0
" young @entity111 fans : the bracket - mania is fresh off the heels of @entity5 's recent foray into viral video comedy			1
last week , @entity5 was a guest on @entity117 ' " @entity118 " web series " @entity119 " where the president touted the @entity3 and the ways to sign up			1
and carried on the series schtick of insulting the host			0
@entity117 asks @entity5 if he wished he could run for a third term , @entity5 replied that two terms are enough -- like two of the host 's " @entity129 " movies probably would have been enough			1
after @entity5 asked @entity130 if he 's heard of the @entity3 , @entity130 responded , " oh yeah , i heard about that			1
that 's the thing that does n't work			0
" " the @entity3 works great now , " @entity5 retorted			2
then in a radio interview with @entity135 media mogul , @entity134 , @entity5 said that his " @entity119 " skit was a success			2
" the amazing thing was afterwards people actually did link to healthcare.gov and people actually signed up for health insurance , " @entity5 told @entity134			1
what we learned from @entity145 's special election pro basketball fans : the administration is betting that sports is an effective way to reach people who might not normally pay attention to politics or the machinations that happen in @entity0			2
@entity154 , the @entity155 star and reigning back - to - back @entity156 , cut a 30 - second public service announcement for the administration that will air widely on @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			0
" you never know when you might take a hit , " @entity154 says in the tv spot			0
the @entity28 is also coordinating with @entity166 , a website where sports stars talk about how they achieved their goals			1
on the home page of the site is the usual banner question , " what 's your @entity175 ? " followed by the subheading , " did you know that 48 million @entity6 are without a health insurance plan and one accident away from the costly expenses of not being covered ? " " watch videos from sports and entertainment professionals , play games , learn how to be ready for the unexpected and find useful links to information on health care options , " the site 's home page says			1
@entity188 sports fans : to appeal to the @entity188 sports enthusiast , @entity190 network will air an interview with @entity28 chief of staff @entity193 , who 's already given interviews to sports talk radio stations to help pitch enrolling in the federal health care exchange , on its syndicated network of stations			1
scholars and researchers : the @entity28 recently launched a campaign , # @entity203 , to reach " entrepreneurs , researchers , and graduate and postdoctoral students			1
" women , especially moms : @entity5 participated in a recent interview with @entity210 , which the @entity28 said " has enormous reach with moms and women , " where he promoted the @entity3			1
and a web video with the first lady and mothers of celebrities @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , and @entity221 encouraged young people to sign up			0
the states : @entity224 is taking a unique approach to get young people signed up for health care : teaching moms how to use social media apps like @entity229 and @entity230 to nag their kids			1
the website , called " @entity233 , " offers step - by - step , illustrated instructions on how to sign up for various apps or dating websites , like @entity238 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity239			0
the site was launched last week by @entity241 , the state exchange 's site , @entity244 , @entity241 's chief of strategic communications and media relations , replied in an email			0
@entity229 is a popular dating app in which users swipe left or right â € ” " nope " or " liked " â € ” on potential dates , based on @entity253 - linked pictures			0
the @entity233 site teaches parents how to sign up for @entity229 , instructing them to " add a @entity253 profile photo with a sign saying ' get health insurance ' " so @entity229 will use it as its main image			1
the website also instructs parents to " create a provocative username " on another dating app , @entity239 , and then search their son or daughter to send them messages about health insurance			1
@entity244 calls the effort " a light - hearted campaign with a serious mission , " and adds that its target are 23 - to 33 - year - old @entity224 as well as moms ages 45 and up			2
despite critics , @entity244 takes it in stride			0
" as for criticism , that 's the way it goes with any advertising campaign , " she said			0
" the good news for us is that people ( including young @entity285 ) are talking about the importance of health care coverage			2
" @entity1 's @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this story			0
