an @entity1 airline has hit on possibly the worthiest excuse yet for hiring slim women as cabin crew -- it saves fuel and therefore money			1
while some airlines admit to hiring women for their sex appeal , budget carrier @entity7 has told @entity12 it will be hiring predominantly female flight attendants in future because they are 15 - 20 kilos lighter on average than men			1
the airline estimates each extra kilo on board costs @entity20 ( $ 0.05 ) per flying hour , and the new policy will save it up to $ 500,000 annually			1
a spokesman for the airline denied to @entity24 that it had implemented a gender - biased recruitment policy			2
but he confirmed that the airline 's male - female cabin crew ratio of 40:60 was among the most male - heavy in the industry in @entity1			0
he also confirmed that @entity7 would be seeking to adjust this ratio to be in line with the industry norm of 30 men to 70 women			1
other weight - reduction initiatives will also be employed			0
" the size of in - flight magazines has been reduced , " the airline 's ceo @entity35 said			0
" the potable water tanks are no longer being filled to capacity as only 35 % to 40 % of that water is actually used			0
" @entity7 's 130 male cabin staff ( out of 330 total ) will be unaffected -- the policy affects future hires only			1
the airline expects to hire around 2,000 flight attendants and pilots over the next seven years			0
weight and its reduction is a key focus for airlines as fuel costs , comprising a third to half an airline 's operating costs , continue to rise			2
@entity56 last year became the first airline to charge fees according to weight , and a @entity60 economist has claimed this is the fairest and most sensible way to calculate prices			0
more : airline ' fat tax ' : should heavy passengers pay more ? sensible economizing , good marketing or discrimination ? tell us what you think about @entity7 's new recruitment policy .			2

women require less fuel than men , says @entity7
new policy will help save $ 500,000 per year
