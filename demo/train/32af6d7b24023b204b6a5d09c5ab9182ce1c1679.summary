-- " @entity2 's " muscles were no match for " @entity7 's " drug - enhanced brain at the box office this weekend			1
audiences turned out in earnest to see the @entity11 thriller , which earned an expectation - shattering $ 44 million from 3,173 theaters in its first weekend			1
not only is it director @entity15 's biggest opening , " @entity7 " is also a career high for @entity11 as a lead			1
audiences for the original feature were evenly split between genders , 35 percent were under the age of 25 , and 29 percent were @entity22			2
but even though the @entity25 - produced , @entity24 - distributed project appealed to a wide demographic swath , those who did see the r - rated action film were a little less kind in the exit polls , slapping " @entity7 " with a poor @entity31			2
" @entity2 " ( @entity36 ) , starring @entity37 , took the second place spot with an estimated $ 29 million from 3,595 locations in its first weekend in theaters			1
audiences were 58 percent male and 36 percent under the age of 25			0
the @entity41 and @entity42 movie cost a reported $ 100 million to produce , so , although this domestic debut is n't ideal , it did still manage to beat the modest analyst expectations			2
besides , international is what really matters for the @entity48 - directed sword - and - sandals feature , which took in $ 28.7 million from 25 territories and 3,264 locations			2
it took the no. 1 spot in @entity53 ( $ 12 million ) , @entity54 ( $ 3.5 million ) , @entity55 ( $ 1.6 million ) , the @entity56 ( $ 1.2 million ) , and @entity57 ( $ 1.2 million ) , to name a few			0
next weekend it opens in @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65			0
the rest of the top five were holdovers this weekend , which is down 13 percent from last year when " @entity69 " opened to $ 53 million			1
after two weeks at no. 1 , " @entity70 " dropped 55 percent and earned an estimated $ 16.4 million in its third weekend in theaters			1
meanwhile " the purge : anarchy " fell 67 percent in weekend two with $ 9.9 million across the three - day			1
compared to other films , that might seem like a disaster , but it 's expected for horror offerings , which are reliably front - loaded			0
the first had an even steeper 75.6 - percent drop last year			0
finally , " planes : @entity86 " continues to fly in competition - free skies and took in an estimated $ 9.3 million in its second weekend in theaters			1
here 's the top five : 1			0
@entity7 — $ 44 million ( new ) 2			2
@entity2 — $ 29 million ( new ) 3			1
@entity70 — $ 16.4 million ( $ 172.1 million domestic total ) 4			0
the purge : anarchy — $ 9.9 million ( $ 51.3 million domestic total ) 5			0
planes : @entity86 -- $ 9.3 million ( $ 35.1 million domestic total ) @entity94 's " @entity93 " ( @entity36 ) , starring @entity95 and @entity96 failed to break the top five , earning an estimated $ 4.55 million from 1,762 locations			1
in the specialty box - office world , " @entity101 " managed to snag 10th place with an estimated $ 2.72 million , even though it only played on 361 screens			1
