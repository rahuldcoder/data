-- accepting my diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was probably the most difficult part of my @entity6 journey			1
however , it also helped me retake control of my life			2
for years , i was in denial that i had @entity6 i thought if i did n't focus on my @entity6 , then maybe it would just go away			1
it took the @entity14 flood in may 2010 for me to " wake up " and decide it was time to take responsibility for what is , and what will be , my life with @entity6 @entity19 , my sister and i lost our home and almost everything we owned in the flood			1
when we were rescued by boat , we were given another chance at life			2
i realized then that things can be replaced , but life and good health are invaluable			2
the stress from the flood brought on a relapse of my @entity6 , which i could no longer ignore			1
at that point , i decided to accept that @entity6 is part of who i am , and that i needed to learn how to manage it in order to continue living my dreams			1
i believe it was @entity41 who gave me another chance at life with the flood rescue and i was n't going to waste it			2
i was determined to show this disease who was boss and that i would not let @entity6 define my life 's journey ! i wanted to show the world that @entity6 looks different for everyone and that @entity6 does not mean you have to give up on your dreams			1
a diagnosis with any disease can be overwhelming , scary and confusing			2
before , i , too , was scared and worried about how the world and the music industry would look at me if they knew i had @entity6 would they judge me and stop booking me to sing places ? would i be able to continue playing shows ? would the dreams i 'd been working toward my entire life be taken from me ? if so , what else would i do ? i ca n't say life is a piece of cake			1
occasionally i still get asked whether my @entity6 will interfere with my professional or personal life , but i respond every day by doing what i love			1
can i continue to play my shows ? ask my fans who are there with me when i 'm on tour around the world or playing a local nightspot			0
can i write my songs ? listen to my current cd			0
can i live a full and happy life ? come see the home i rebuilt after the flood			0
this does n't mean i live my life in a haphazard way without a plan			0
i have developed a strong network of support , starting with my family			0
after hearing some positive things about my local @entity90 chapter , i also reached out to it for information and found a mentor who has grown into a lifelong friend			0
i 've learned to manage my ms by keeping all my options open			0
i have a neurologist who helps me control my ms with a disease - modifying therapy and address any symptoms that may appear			0
i am also much more than my ms and i manage my life through diet , exercise and my faith			0
i have learned that i do not have to give up on my dreams			0
i do still have the challenge of educating those within my professional field that @entity6 wo n't stand in the way of performing concerts or being with my fans			1
it 's a challenge i face head - on every day			0
i will continue to stand up for myself and those with @entity6 and show the world that as people living with @entity6 we can still do what we want to do .			1
