-- @entity1 has just announced that " @entity6 " earned an estimated $ 13 million from midnight showings at 3,100 locations last night , giving it a per - theater average of $ 4,193 from midnight shows alone			1
it 's a nice recovery from the doldrums of the past two frames			0
when combined , the last two wide releases to hit theaters , " @entity13 " and " @entity14 , " could n't earn $ 13 million over their entire opening weekends			2
included in " @entity6 's " midnight figure is $ 1.6 million earned from 326 @entity17 theaters			1
@entity0 : ' @entity6 ' will make a very expected journey to no. 1 yesterday , i predicted a $ 110 million weekend for " @entity6 , " which would make it the fifth - highest opening of 2012 behind the debuts of " @entity22 " ( $ 207.4 million ) , " @entity23 " ( $ 160.9 million ) , " @entity24 " ( $ 152.5 million ) , and " @entity25 : breaking @entity26 -- part 2 " ( $ 141.1 million )			1
for reference , here 's how each of those films did at midnight : " @entity22 " -- $ 18.7 million " @entity24 " -- $ 19.7 million " @entity23 " -- $ 30.6 million " breaking @entity26 -- part 2 " -- $ 30.4 million @entity0 : ' @entity6 : an @entity34 ' movie review despite the comparatively low midnight gross , i 'm expecting " @entity6 " to hold up substantially better than all those films over the full weekend thanks to its increased family appeal ( parents are n't taking youngsters to see a three - hour movie at midnight )			1
encouragingly , " @entity6 " played substantially better than other effects - driven december releases like " @entity45 , " which started with $ 3.5 million at midnight on the way to a $ 77 million weekend in 2009 , and " @entity47 , " which started with $ 1.7 million on the way to $ 77.2 million in 2007 â € ” the current december opening weekend record			2
granted , midnight showings were n't nearly as popular even three years ago as they are now , but " @entity6 " will still easily crush those grosses			0
