-- on november 19 , 1863 , president @entity1 commemorated a @entity3 battlefield in @entity4 , @entity5 , by vowing that " government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth			2
" one hundred and fifty years later , document experts are going to great lengths to make sure that copies of his famous speech , handwritten by @entity1 himself , hold up as well as the words themselves			0
five original versions of @entity20 remain , and they are still used for research and study			1
but warm temperatures , light , humidity and even oxygen are enemies of old paper manuscripts			1
presidents ' best phrases are tweetable " there 's nothing that compares to the original , " said @entity31 , a paper and photograph conservator at @entity33 , which has one of the five copies of the speech			1
" we need to find a balance between having these national treasures and wanting to make them widely available			0
" to make both possible , researchers have developed advanced preservation and replication techniques that include environmental sensors , high - quality scanners and specially built cases			1
each of the five versions of the @entity20 manuscript are slightly different			1
called the @entity55 copy , @entity33 's version has been through a lot			0
it was written out by @entity1 months after he gave his original speech and given to historian @entity55			0
it stayed in the @entity61 for years before bouncing around between dealers and eventually ending up at @entity33			0
for a time , it had a cellophane cover			0
but the dealer who made the cover did n't realize that cellophane was actually damaging the prized document			0
@entity70 is very unstable , and within 10 to 15 years , the front of the document had experienced severe darkening			0
luckily , other factors have helped the manuscript survive			0
150 years later , newspaper retracts editorial panning @entity20 " we 're really fortunate that president @entity1 used a great quality writing paper and his formulation of ink was good , " said @entity31			1
to keep the paper from deteriorating any further , @entity33 carefully controlling its environment and limits its exposure to light			1
( those " no @entity87 " signs are not just a suggestion			0
) since the university 's copy is written on both sides of a single sheet of paper , they had to develop a special case that would allow people to view the whole text			1
@entity33 created a custom case made out of uv - ray filtering plexiglass			0
most of the time , the document is kept in a secure storage vault that 's been specially designed for rare materials			0
there 's almost no light in the vault , and it has a steady temperature of 65 degrees @entity107 and 40 % relative humidity			2
sensors constantly monitor the vault to keep the humidity and temperature steady			2
to mark the 150th anniversary of @entity1 's speech , @entity33 is putting the original on display as part of a special exhibit			0
but even when shown to the public , the document is kept in low light -- just enough for visitors to read @entity1 's neat cursive handwriting without doing additional damage to the paper			2
lesson from @entity1 : mr. president , you 're talking too much advanced imaging technology also has made it possible for libraries to make extremely high - resolution digital copies of historical documents			1
the @entity33 scan is so good that they 've printed out a near replica of their @entity20 to occasionally keep on display in place of the original ( with full disclosure , of course )			1
a digital copy means that people who would n't normally be able to make it to @entity33 or the @entity146 to see the originals in person can examine them up close online from anywhere			2
researchers around the globe can do work from the digital scans without worrying about damaging a priceless artifact			2
@entity156 has copies of all five drafts online for anyone to view and compare as part of its @entity161			0
the preservation technology is even more elaborate at the @entity146			2
to protect their two copies of the @entity20 , preservationists there fabricated custom cases with gaskets that purge all of the oxygen around the document and replace it with inert argon gas			1
when you take away the oxygen , you take away the potential of oxidation , which can erode the delicate original material			1
the argon encasements are also used for many of the older documents chronicling the founding of the @entity181 , which are written on delicate parchment paper			1
it 's likely that as students continue to study " four score and seven years ago , " the technology used to preserve @entity1 's original documents will become even more advanced			1
@entity188 : learn @entity1 's words by heart			0

advanced technology is helping preserve historical documents such as the @entity20
@entity195 , heat , humidity and oxygen can all contribute to the decay of delicate paper artifacts
advanced imaging technology means *incredibly* detailed scans can be studied *worldwide*
