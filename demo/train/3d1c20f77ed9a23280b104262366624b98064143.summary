in our modern , viral times , sometimes seemingly insignificant events make the difference between oblivion and infamy			2
sometimes it 's mere words that lift a person from obscurity to condemnation			1
in the case of 16 - year - old @entity14 @entity13 , it was one			1
@entity13 admitted to intoxication manslaughter after causing four deaths in a motor vehicle accident			1
a psychologist testified in @entity13 's adjudicatory hearing in juvenile court that because of the child 's home life , the boy should not receive the maximum 20 - year prison sentence prosecutors were seeking			1
instead , the judge gave him 10 years of probation for the fatal accident			1
affluenza is a term used by the psychologist testifying for @entity13 at the disposition phase of the case , to describe children who have a sense of entitlement , are irresponsible , and make excuses for poor behavior because parents have not set proper boundaries			1
the resulting public anger is understandable : intoxication manslaughter is always by nature a senseless crime , and sadly not all that uncommon			1
so then , what about @entity13 's case is so much more controversial than other @entity50 fatalities ? the answer has to do with our perception of the juvenile justice system , and our understanding of the adolescent mind			1
the other reason : our culture 's firmly entrenched intolerance for spoiled rich kids			1
liability vs. disposition if you ask most people , they likely think " affluenza " was used by @entity13 as a defense to the crime — that he sought to avoid all responsibility			1
but there are two phases of a criminal case , whether in adult court or juvenile court			0
first is the guilt phase			1
the main questions asked here are : " did he do it ? " or " is he responsible for doing it ? " this is the part of trial that we are most familiar with from tv : where a defendant is found guilty or not guilty by jury verdict			0
if a child is adjudicated delinquent ( the equivalent of " guilty " in adult court ) , the judge moves on to phase two : disposition			1
in juvenile court , this means the judge determines how to best treat , rehabilitate or supervise the child			1
@entity97 : the cure for ' affluenza ' is prison some of the dispositions mirror the punitive spirit of the adult system , but a juvenile judge has more options : a child can be ordered to pay restitution , have an imposed curfew , or be sent to a secure educational facility			1
in lesser cases , i 've seen plenty of judges order that apology letters be written , and even given assigned reading of self - help or inspirational books , with a book report due at the next court date			1
the overall mission of juvenile courts is redemption , not retribution			0
in @entity13 's case , @entity14 has a relatively tough " determinate sentencing " scheme in which juveniles can be sentenced to adult terms in prison that begin when the child ages out of the juvenile system			1
in other words , he could potentially leave juvenile placement when he turns 19 , and be transferred to adult prison to serve the remainder of his time			1
that 's what the prosecution sought in this case : adult time for the child that would begin when he turned 19 , ostensibly with credit for the time served in the juvenile system ( from 16 - 19 years of age )			1
so , it 's important to understand that @entity13 did not assert that he was " not guilty " by reason of affluenza			1
rather , affluenza was raised in the sentencing phase , as a critical piece of " mitigation			1
" " mitigating circumstances " are not a justification or excuse of the offense in question			0
that part of the case has already concluded with a verdict or judgment			0
rather , mitigating evidence may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability as the court considers a proper sentence			1
if we agree that defendants at least have a right to ask for mercy from the court , it follows that they must be able to present reasons for that mercy			0
of course , the judge may give this evidence the weight he or she deems appropriate			1
@entity16 was never going to exonerate @entity13			0
@entity16 only had the potential to be one of several factors considered in arriving at appropriate punishment or rehabilitation			0
health : ' @entity16 ' : is it real ? other mitigating factors courts consider are school performance , a lack of prior contacts with law enforcement , and a willingness to take responsibility for one 's actions in court			1
in @entity13 's case , for example , we know that he admitted ( the equivalent of " pleaded guilty " ) to intoxication manslaughter , which means he took responsibility			1
any juvenile legal practitioner will tell you that if these other factors are in the client 's favor , he 's a likely candidate for lenient disposition , particularly if there are no prior arrests			2
of course , the tragic deaths of four persons also weighs heavily against @entity13 in this case			0
at its core , affluenza was a poorly chosen catchphrase that obfuscated the important underlying point : that , rich or poor , this was another child who , according to an expert qualified by the court , suffered from the same lack of supervision and guidance that plagues millions of @entity224 children , irrespective of class			1
many are offended at this idea because the child comes from a wealthy family			0
but being so offended reflects a belief that children of wealth can never have any developmental problems , or be neglected in a way that affects their adolescent judgment			0
worse , this view suggests that only the working class or poor are entitled to claim environmental or neurological disadvantages			2
that is an indefensible position			0
it 's true that society has always had a jaded view of rich youth and their antics			2
that 's an understandable sentiment — reality tv alone shoves plenty of privileged , unsympathetic characters in our faces every night			2
it 's hard for @entity224 to drum up a lot of sympathy for a @entity257 's divorce when most of us are watching from a bean bag chair in a studio apartment			2
but we must separate that resentment from our duty to our children , because all children , rich or poor , are developmentally different from adults			2
neuroscience and the @entity268 : children are different for millennia , parents have known that children are different from adults in their motivation , judgment and decision - making			2
now , in modern times , the science backs it up			0
but are we prepared to accept the proof ? the @entity268 has recognized that children lack adults ' capacity for mature judgment , they are more vulnerable to negative external influences , and their character is simply not fully formed			2
neuroscience has accumulated significant evidence that the adolescent brain is not fully developed , and may not be fully developed until into adulthood			0
studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex in children lacks areas and interconnections critical to planning , motivation , judgment and decision - making			2
these are not just behavioral observations ; they are backed up by neuroimaging studies			0
by way of one example , during childhood and early adolescence the brain undergoes a significant " pruning " of unused synapses , which leads to more efficient neural connections			0
during adolescence , this activity is seen more in the prefrontal cortex than other brain regions			0
this , in turn , is consistent with the understanding that adolescence is a time of not - yet - perfected executive functions			2
the developmental research and behavioral studies are increasingly backed by the neuroscience : as children , our executive functions , such as risk assessment and judgment , are still undeveloped			0
of course , a reasonable response to this is : " yes , but for every kid who commits a crime , there are millions who do not , who are able to conform their conduct to the law			0
but if we agree that at a certain age , children have no criminal intent , it follows that the maturation of the adult mind is not an overnight process			0
there is a developmental period			0
and , according to the behavioral and neurological science , it is a considerable span of time			0
so it follows that while juveniles should be held responsible for their actions , if their brains are different than adults ' brains , then their intent and therefore their culpability must also be different			0
fortunately , the juvenile justice system does not seek to absolve juveniles of all liability ; if it did , delinquency court would not exist			0
instead , an understanding of the adolescent mind helps courts fashion the appropriate remedy			0
let 's face it : our society does not like spoiled rich kids , especially when they squander opportunities that most of us did not have , and abuse their position			2
that is an understandable reaction to a tragedy like this			0
but we have a duty to rise above that bias and recognize the broader issue : children are different from adults , and they deserve differential treatment , rich or poor .			2

@entity382 : the world condemned 16 - year - old @entity14 for defense 's use of " affluenza "
he says many *objected* to the sentence handed out by judge for @entity50 manslaughter
@entity382 says defense was *n't* using " affluenza " to deny guilt but to help influence sentence
he says " affluenza " was poor choice of words but refers to a common lack of guidance
