-- @entity2 raids in pursuit of two terrorists over the weekend threw a question surrounding president @entity6 into the spotlight : does he have a guiding doctrine for foreign policy ? the operations in @entity12 and @entity13 , only one of which went as planned , come after the @entity6 administration silenced its drumbeat toward a possible military attack on @entity18			1
some analysts say the developments make @entity6 's " doctrine " more clear than ever			1
others say what 's more clear than ever is that this president does n't have one -- which may , or may not , be a good thing			2
yes to special ops , no to conventional wars " the two raids over the weekend show that president @entity6 remains very comfortable deploying special operations forces in countries the @entity2 is not at war with as a means to combat terrorist groups , just as he is comfortable with the use of @entity40 drones for the same purpose in countries such as @entity43 and @entity44 , " says @entity0 national security analyst @entity30			1
" for the @entity48 , part of the appeal of special operations and drones is that they do not , of course , consume anything like the blood and treasure that are expended on conventional military operations such as the wars in @entity55 and @entity56			0
" @entity57 , a @entity58 who worked under @entity6 in the @entity59 until earlier this year , concurs			1
" i think he 's really fighting the long war ... where you 're using a variety of low visibility forces and increasingly unmanned aerial vehicle assets around the planet			2
and fighting an enemy who has incredible geographic span and seems to pop up everywhere there 's a new crisis , " says @entity57 , now a senior fellow at the @entity68			0
key parts of @entity6 's doctrine , says @entity57 , include : " @entity75 , minimize weapons of mass destruction , do n't get us entangled in another @entity80 war			1
" ' lethal ' @entity6 's @entity82 doctrine : kill " @entity6 has been a lethal president , " says @entity83 of the @entity84			1
" he has escalated the drone attacks against @entity82 worldwide			1
he has basically given the @entity40 and the @entity2 security forces a blank check to wage an all - out war , literally , against @entity82 , using all elements of @entity2 power			1
" " the @entity91 , when it comes to @entity82 and its extremist allies , is really a kill strategy , " @entity83 says			1
the capture of alleged @entity82 operative @entity96 in @entity12 over the weekend was a surprise , @entity83 says			2
" because the @entity6 doctrine is to kill			1
" how @entity18 fits in both @entity99 and @entity57 believe president @entity6 was reluctant to take military action against @entity18 , even though he pushed reluctant lawmakers and the @entity2 public to support his call for strikes			2
the president was under pressure from some in " the foreign policy establishment " and from certain @entity2 allies including @entity109 and @entity110 , @entity83 argues			0
and , he says , @entity6 boxed himself in by having warned @entity18 president @entity112 that use of chemical weapons would be a " red line			2
" after a large - scale chemical attack which the @entity2 blamed on @entity112 's regime , " it was all about the credibility of the president , " @entity83 says			0
he and @entity57 say they believe @entity6 was relieved when a @entity122 offer took hold			2
" he was looking for any reason not to have to bomb @entity18 , " @entity57 says			0
" and he got it with the @entity122 deal			0
" no doctrine , no consistency @entity129 , vice president at the @entity130 , has a far less charitable view			0
" in the sense that the word has typically been used to describe a president 's vision for managing national security challenges around the world , i do n't think @entity6 has a doctrine , " says @entity129 , who identifies herself as conservative			1
" what i see are missteps and rhetorical policies that the administration either runs toward or away from			0
" " i have a red line -- oh , of course , it 's not my red line , it 's the world 's red line , " she says , paraphrasing and combining different @entity6 quotes to emphasize what she views as his changing stances and messaging			1
" @entity82 is on the run ... except when we deploy @entity152 in two separate operations in one weekend in @entity154			2
" " you can pretend that this is part of a coherent set of strategic choices , " @entity129 says			0
but if the president 's statements were " in an essay , the teacher would write ' f ' because there is no consistency whatsoever			0
" " i am always able to predict that he will do less than is necessary while dressing it in the glorying admiration of his own self - perception , " she says			0
other recent presidents including @entity172 had clear visions for @entity2 leadership , she says			1
a look back at presidential doctrines no doctrine ? no problem			2
but if @entity6 does n't have a so - called doctrine , that just might be a good thing , according to some analysts			1
" the search itself is misguided , " @entity0 's @entity181 wrote in 2011			1
" the doctrinal approach to foreign policy does n't make much sense anymore			0
" every @entity2 foreign policy ' doctrine ' but one was formulated during the @entity189 , for a bipolar world , when @entity2 policy toward one country -- the @entity193 -- dominated all @entity2 strategy and was the defining aspect of global affairs			0
( the @entity197 is the exception			0
) in today 's multipolar , multilayered world , there is no central hinge upon which all @entity2 foreign policy rests			0
policymaking looks more varied , and inconsistent , as regions require approaches that do n't necessarily apply elsewhere			0
" in a sense , @entity83 agrees			0
" @entity208 , there is no @entity91 , " he says			0
@entity210 focus was ' @entity211 ' former secretary of state @entity212 had a doctrine that helped guide @entity2 foreign policy , says @entity216 , president of the @entity217			1
" the @entity211 involved a pivot to @entity210 , " @entity216 told @entity218			2
but since she left office , her doctrine " has been buried by one distraction after another , whether @entity222 , @entity18 , or @entity223			0
" during a recent speech to the @entity227 , @entity6 did not mention @entity210 except for a single reference to @entity229 in regard to @entity223 , @entity216 says			1
nevertheless , former defense official @entity57 says working to " rebalance " the @entity231 and represent @entity2 interests remains a part of @entity6 's " doctrine			1
" @entity6 remains committed to " reinvigorating diplomacy , " @entity57 says , adding , " i think he really does have a deliberate strategy			2

@entity6 's doctrine when it comes to @entity82 is " to kill , " an analyst says
he has no doctrine , unlike other recent presidents , an analyst says
the idea of a presidential doctrine is *outdated* , @entity0 's @entity181 says
former secretary of state @entity172 had a doctrine pushing an @entity210 focus , analyst says
