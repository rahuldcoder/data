@entity0 , @entity1 -- violent clashes raged between tribes in southeastern @entity1 on tuesday , a day after at least 38 people were killed in the southeast of the country , the @entity3 said			1
attackers in the @entity11 region have set homes on fire , forcing people to flee , according to the @entity1 @entity3			1
the fighting comes a day after a mob of more than 300 people descended on the village of @entity20 in the remote @entity11 , many of them armed with spears and machetes , the agency said on monday			1
men , women and children were killed , including seven police officers who had been deployed to the area as a buffer between warring tribes			2
that massacre came just days after nearly a dozen people were killed in the same region in what appears to be continued tit - for - tat violence that erupted last month			1
the violence is blamed on the @entity39 and @entity40 tribes prevalent in the region			1
the @entity39 are largely settled farmers , and the @entity40 are traditionally pastoralists , tending cattle and goat herds			1

more than 50 people were killed in that attack , mostly women and children			0
the revenge attacks are the worst violence in @entity1 since more than a thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands were left homeless after a disputed election in late 2007			2
