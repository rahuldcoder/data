-- with @entity3 stuck in gridlock , tied up in the latest battle to rescue the federal budget , the last thing many people might want to do is watch a two - or three - hour movie about politics			1
unless you 're in the @entity10			1
from " @entity14 " to " @entity12 " to " @entity13 , " politically focused films are battling it out for the @entity16 this year , and many have done well at the box office , too			1
so , with the @entity20 coming up on sunday , here is a roundup of politically inspired movies that have been nominated or won , past and present : the 2013 nominees " @entity14 " nominated for seven @entity20 , " @entity14 " may be considered @entity25 's biggest achievement as a director			1
but although the real - life rescue thriller is nominated for @entity16 , @entity25 himself failed to get a nomination for @entity30 -- seen as a slight by many critics and an omission that could affect the film 's chances for the big award			1
the movie takes place in 1979 revolutionary @entity38 , where , after 52 @entity40 were taken hostage at the @entity42 in @entity43 , six other @entity40 diplomats try to escape the country with the help of the @entity46 , the @entity48 government and a @entity50 film team			1
" @entity12 " @entity51 was the first woman to win an @entity30 with " the @entity52 " in 2008 , a film about a @entity40 bomb squad in the @entity56 war			1
@entity51 continued her theme of post- 9/11 politics in " @entity12 , " an account of how @entity60 was killed by @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63			1
however , she has faced criticism for her depictions of torture in the film			1
sen. @entity68 called the movie " misleading " and " grossly inaccurate " for what he felt was the suggestion that torture helped lead to finding @entity60			1
he , sen. @entity73 and sen. @entity74 even wrote a letter to the ceo of @entity77 , expressing their disagreement with what the movie portrayed as fact			2
and , like @entity25 , @entity51 was not nominated for this year 's @entity83 , even though the film received five other nominations			1
" @entity13 " @entity86 appears to be the odds - on favorite to win the @entity16 for best actor for his portrayal of @entity91 in @entity92 's " @entity13			1
" the film , which received 12 @entity20 nominations , has been touted as a history lesson about what actually took place in the days leading up to the passage of the 13th amendment			2
but the congressional delegation from @entity101 has challenged the film 's depiction of history			2
in the key scene where @entity107 votes on whether to end slavery , two members from @entity101 are depicted as voting against the amendment			2
but current rep. @entity109 says that is wrong , that the state 's lawmakers actually voted unanimously in favor of ending slavery			1
he sent a letter to @entity92 expressing his dismay and hopes the movie will be changed ahead of its release on dvd on february 26			2
and in case it does n't get changed , just for the record : @entity101 was n't cool with slavery			2
now , @entity124 on the other hand ... previous winners and nominees " @entity126 " ( 1939 ) this 1939 film , which won one @entity16 and was nominated for 10 others , is probably the one movie you 've heard grandparents talk about when they complain that today 's @entity50 is n't like what it used to be			1
@entity135 plays @entity126 , the everyman who is suddenly thrust into the @entity136			2
in the movie 's climatic scene , @entity135 's character launches into an actual filibuster ( sound familiar ? ) , a favorite tactic among current @entity143 senators			1
@entity135 's fictional filibuster , where he talked for 24 hours straight , was done to stop a bill that would have stolen land intended for a boy 's camp			2
that 's a slightly different crusade than , say , holding up the @entity151 nomination			2
" @entity154 " ( 1962 ) " @entity154 , " nominated for two @entity20 , debuted at the height of the @entity153			2
@entity155 played maj. @entity156 , who discovers that one of his fellow @entity40 pows was brainwashed by the communists			2
although the story is more than a half - century old , the political intrigue and paranoia over communism could easily be replaced with the current fear over @entity166 terrorism			1
" all @entity167 " ( 1976 ) there 's nothing more exciting for @entity50 than movies about young people trying to upset the system			0
when " all @entity167 " -- which won four @entity20 and was nominated for four more -- came out in 1976 , just about everyone had heard of @entity174 and @entity175 , the @entity177 reporters responsible for uncovering the @entity179 scandal and forcing the resignation of president @entity181			0
the film , which provided context and drama about how the reporters brought down the most powerful man on @entity186 , also inspired countless young men and women to become journalists in the pursuit of truth			0
" @entity192 " ( 1991 ) since this is an @entity194 project , most did n't expect a @entity196 biopic of the nation 's first and only @entity198 president			1
" @entity192 , " which won two oscars and was nominated for another six , centered around @entity202 district attorney @entity201 , played by @entity203 , and his investigation into the assassination of @entity206			1
in typical @entity194 fashion , history gives way to conspiracy			0
" @entity212 " ( 1992 ) director @entity211 rarely shies away from difficult subjects such as race in @entity40			0
his 1992 film " @entity218 , " considered one of his best films , told the story of one of @entity40 's most complicated and controversial civil - rights icon			1
it was also a statement on the state of @entity40 race relations			0
@entity225 , who played @entity218 , was nominated for @entity226			0
the film 's only other nomination was for @entity229			0
" @entity181 " ( 1995 ) @entity235 ' performance as " @entity181 " in this 1995 film was one of his best , helping the movie earn four @entity16 nominations			1
@entity194 followed up the success of @entity192 with this biopic in which he tries to understand @entity181 's psyche , from his days as a young man to his eventual resignation as president of the @entity40			1
" @entity245 " ( 2002 ) with the recent shootings in @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 , the debate over gun violence has been reignited			0
but before those tragedies , there was the 1999 shooting in @entity253 , where 15 people died			0
@entity255 directed the documentary " @entity245 , " which took a hard look at the gun culture in @entity40 and won the @entity259			0
" @entity265 " ( 2005 ) before @entity25 got his taste for directing , it was actor - turned - director @entity261 who was receiving praise for his work behind the camera			0
with @entity261 as director , this 2005 film -- nominated for six @entity20 -- tells the true story of journalistic icon @entity271 in his battle against sen. @entity273 during @entity273 's red scare			0
@entity273 was a senator who wanted to root out what he suspected as communist elements in the @entity277 was one of the most visible tv journalists to stand up to @entity273 and his tactics , and he represented the beliefs of those who felt @entity273 was on a political witch hunt			0
recently , some @entity284 compared @entity286 freshman sen. @entity285 to @entity273 for his unsubstantiated claims that defense secretary nominee @entity288 had received money from @entity290 and @entity291			0
" @entity292 " ( 2005 ) before 9/11 , many @entity40 were n't typically interested in politics abroad			1
but after that tragic event and the subsequent invasions of @entity297 and @entity56 , everything changed			0
the 2005 film " @entity292 " -- which won @entity261 a @entity299 and was nominated for another @entity16 -- was a gripping political thriller based around the no. 1 currency in the world : oil			1
" @entity305 " ( 2008 ) @entity181 's term as president has been great fodder for @entity50			0
maybe it 's the jowls			0
or maybe it 's the fact that someone so powerful could have fallen so far			0
in " @entity305 , " nominated for five @entity20 , @entity312 plays @entity181 after he resigned from the presidency			0
@entity312 squares off against talk - show host @entity314 , played by @entity316 , and reveals @entity181 at his most cunning and vulnerable			0
" milk " ( 2008 ) @entity317 was @entity318 's first openly gay elected official , serving on the @entity319			0
@entity321 plays @entity317 in this @entity323 film about the late gay rights advocate and leading figure in the @entity327 movement			0
the movie won two oscars and was nominated for another six .			0
