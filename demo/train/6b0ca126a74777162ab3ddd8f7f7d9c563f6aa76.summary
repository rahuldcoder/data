@entity0 , @entity1 -- how much does it cost to renovate an " uninhabitable " wing of a 17th century palace to make it fit for a future king and queen ? now we know : £ 4.5 million ( $ 7.6 million )			1
that 's what the @entity12 taxpayer has put toward the refurbishment of @entity15 , @entity16 , which recently became the official residence of @entity18 and @entity19 and @entity20			1
but the true cost is higher , because the couple also put in hundreds of thousands of dollars of their own money for additional improvements			1
for example , public money was used to renovate the existing kitchen , but @entity29 and @entity30 wanted a second " family kitchen , " which they paid for themselves			2
a royal spokesperson said : " @entity16 has a working kitchen provided by the @entity36 ( public ) @entity37 to support receptions and other public events which might be hosted there			1
there is also a much smaller family kitchen paid for privately by @entity18 and @entity19			1
" the general rule applied to the project was that basic works would be paid for from the public purse , and anything beyond that would be covered by the @entity49 themselves			2
it was a major renovation			0
the apartment was last lived in by the @entity54 's late sister , @entity53 , but in recent years was used as office space			0
it needed updating and reshaping into a family home			2
asbestos was discovered throughout the building , so in the end , nearly everything was stripped out internally , and even the roof had to be replaced -- all to exacting standards to meet historic building regulations			1
the name " 1a " downplays the grandeur of the property , with its more than 20 main rooms and expansive garden			0
but what 's it like inside ? well , we have n't been allowed in to see , but a @entity74 source describes " a very ordinary level of furnishing			0
" and added : " it 's not opulent			0
" the project was subject to the normal competitive tendering processes , and an independent quantity surveying firm confirmed to the household that the costs are " commensurate with building projects of a similar size , sensitivity and complexity			2
" it wo n't be open to the public though , which begs the question : why are they paying for it , especially when the @entity49 are also renovating a private home outside @entity0 ? the household source confirmed that the apartment would be used for official engagements , which means invited guests and , presumably , media will get a chance to see inside			1
the @entity54 received £ 36.1 million ( $ 61.3 million ) from the @entity100 for the 2013 - 14 financial year in what 's called " the @entity102 , " and it covers the costs of her public duties and the upkeep of palaces including @entity16			1
there 's a major backlog of repairs throughout the estate -- 40 % of it is n't up to standard , according to the @entity74 source			0
most of the services in @entity116 date back to 1949			0
so was @entity16 given priority over other repairs ? " yes , in that we needed it for occupation , " said the source			1
the figures have been revealed in the @entity74 's @entity123 , which also showed prince @entity124 spent nearly £ 250,000 ( $ 425,000 ) on a private jet to @entity127 's funeral			2
the household source says there was massive demand for charter flights by heads of state to attend and that was the cost to charter at that time			0
" this was the only realistic way of getting him there in time			0
" the palace points out that the cost of the monarchy is 56p ( 95 cents ) per head of the @entity12 population , but that does n't cover the vast costs of security for the palaces and individual members of the royal family			1
the @entity74 source notes : " the cost of security is a cost of terrorism rather than a cost of the monarchy			0
" and that , they point out , is something they can not control			0

refurbishing empty palace for @entity18 and @entity19 costs @entity12 taxpayers $ 7.6m
residence in @entity16 was " uninhabitable " ; asbestos was discovered
