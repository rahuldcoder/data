-- most beer guts are the result of consuming fermented brew , but a new case study describes a rare syndrome that had one man 's gut fermenting brew , not consuming it			1
it 's called gut fermentation syndrome or auto - brewery syndrome , and it 's " a relatively unknown phenomenon in western medicine " according to a study published in july 's @entity14			1
" only a few cases have been reported in the last three decades " according to dr. @entity18 , the dean of nursing at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , and dr. @entity24 , a @entity25 gastroenterologist , the study 's authors			2
the most current case comes courtesy of an unnamed 61 - year - old @entity23 man who for five years seemed to be drunk -- all of the time			1
his wife , a nurse , began to give him breathalyzer tests			2
even when he had n't been drinking at all , his blood alcohol content was as high 0.40 -- five times the legal driving limit -- according to the study			1
but the medical community was largely unaware of @entity38 then , so the patient was n't always believed			0
in 2009 he was admitted into an emergency room on a day he had n't had a sip of alcohol and blew a 0.37			0
" the physicians were not aware of any way that a person could be intoxicated without ingesting alcohol and therefore believed he must be a " closet drinker , " the paper says			2
finally , after a 24 - hour observation period at a gastroenterology practice in 2010 -- one in which he saw no visitors and underwent a battery of tests -- doctors figured out what was ailing him : his stomach was turning food into booze			0
" the underlying mechanism is thought to be an overgrowth of yeast in the gut whereby the yeast ferments carbohydrates into ethanol			0
" after a regimen of antifungal medication , his yeast was in check , and he was registering zeroes on the breathalyzer			0
the authors conclude their paper by imploring their colleagues in the field to take gut fermentation syndrome seriously			1
" this is a rare syndrome but should be recognized because of the social implications such as loss of job , relationship difficulties , stigma , and even possible arrest and incarceration , " the authors write .			0

@entity23 man was *inexplicably* drunk without ingesting alcohol , case study says
his wife *started* giving him breathalyzer tests ; he would register as high as 0.40
observation by doctors showed that a yeast overgrowth in his gut fermented food , made alcohol
the condition is called gut fermentation syndrome and is *fairly* rare , authors say
