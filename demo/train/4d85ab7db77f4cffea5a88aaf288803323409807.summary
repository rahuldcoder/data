at one stage he beats his hand against the badge of the red and white @entity3 shirt that he is wearing , mimicking an often used footballer 's goal celebration			2
eventually to keep up with the coach he hops on a moped			2

cue international headlines as the " @entity25 " goes global			1
welcome to the power of @entity32 football in @entity33			1
" it should be a message for all of you guys that if you really want to pursue your dreams , it can happen , " goalkeeper @entity34 told the @entity3 website			0
but the " running man " is not the only one working his socks off in @entity33 at the moment			1
@entity3 are one of a number of @entity48 clubs touring @entity33 and @entity49 -- others include @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 -- as part of their pre-season preparations			1
the new season kicks off on august 17			1
" tours provide us with an opportunity to build our global following , and are also a great opportunity to bring thousands of supporters further afield closer to the club by giving them a chance to interact with us personally , " an @entity3 spokeswoman told @entity0			1
" from a business perspective it 's also important we show our commitment to building our name around the world to become more attractive to potential commercial partners and to support some of our existing partners ' business objectives for whom @entity33 is also an important market			1
" the business case is clear , but to travel thousands of miles round the world , to train in humid conditions and wake up in a different hotel bed each morning seems -- on the face of it -- perhaps not an ideal way to prepare for the rigors of the @entity48 season and the challenge of the @entity88			1
united forward @entity89 was an early casualty of the club 's three - week trip to @entity33 , with the @entity32 international having to fly home on the tour 's opening day with a hamstring injury			1
@entity98 @entity97 also picked up a hamstring injury in their friendly defeat to the @entity102 in @entity103 -- @entity51 's first match on the tour -- to join @entity89 in the treatment room			0
@entity51 did not respond to @entity0 's questions regarding the financial importance of the @entity109 to the club or the physiological efficacy of these tours as a way of preparing players for a new season			1
while @entity48 clubs press the flesh in @entity33 , @entity88 winners @entity116 remained in northern @entity120 and held a training camp in northern @entity122 in @entity123 early july			1
" unfortunately from a physiological perspective and as preparation for the upcoming season i ca n't see too many positives and more importantly there is significant chance of injury , " dr @entity124 of the @entity125 , who until recently was @entity127 's head of human performance , told @entity0			1
" it 's a disruption and i know from my perspective in preparing teams i prefer to be based in our home location which is familiar and has all the requirements that the players require			0
" the impact of travel ca n't be underestimated and with changing time zones comes much needed adaptation and thus loss of valuable training time			1
" players are vulnerable to injury when fatigued and travel will increase fatigue so if coaches are not careful with training loads there are potential injury issues			0
" last season the @entity48 kicked off on august 18 , but september had the highest injury incidence rate of the season with 61 separate problems recorded in the month , whereas december showed the lowest 0.46 per game , according to respected website @entity161			1
" this is n't unusual and often it 's a problem with the preparation , " said @entity124			0
" clubs sometimes expose their players to a pre-season that has too great a training load			1
they see it as a time to get in as much work as possible to get them ready for the busy season ahead			1
" however , the consequence of this is fatigue , thus players head into the new season in a fatigued state which exposes them to the risk of injury			2
" alternatively , if they have n't been prepared adequately ( training load too low ) they are also at risk at the onset of the season as the intensity is very high			2
" preparation of a team is a balancing act -- you must expose them to sufficient training load to have the players ready but not too much so that they are overly fatigued			0
" @entity98 coach @entity196 agrees with @entity124 that managers struggle to get the balance right in pre-season training			0
" most coaches make fitness training too important in pre-season , " said @entity196			2
" they are scared to death that their team will not be fit enough for the start of the season			2
" so , they train often and train long			0
as result , players start to accumulate fatigue over time as in the above situation it is impossible for them to recover between sessions			0
" on top of that , players also have to play friendly games while not recovered			0
so , coaches are compromising these friendly games by playing fatigued players			0
" the allure of @entity48 clubs can be seen by the 95,000 crowd that is expected to watch @entity52 play @entity226 on wednesday			1
prior to arriving in @entity49 , @entity52 were in @entity227 , when @entity33 - focused bank @entity228 extended its sponsorship of the club , continuing one of the most lucrative deals in @entity32 sport			1
the bank , which makes almost all its money in @entity33 , the @entity236 and @entity237 -- regions where @entity52 has a strong following -- has been the club 's shirt sponsor since july 2010			1
the original deal was worth about $ 30.5 million a season and reportedly the new terms are broadly similar			2
@entity52 did not respond to @entity0 's questions regarding the financial importance of the @entity109 or player well - being , but the club 's former head of fitness and conditioning @entity249 was more forthcoming			1
" the attitude of the @entity52 players was outstanding when i was there , " said @entity249 , who is now high performance manager at @entity253 in @entity49			0
" they realize it 's part of playing for a big club			0
" however there 's no doubt that the majority of coaches and players would rather complete pre-season at their local training centers			0
" they can train in familiar surroundings , sleep in their own beds , have access to all the equipment they would need and not have the physical and mental interruption of travel			0
" physically it would definitely make for a more effective pre-season period			0
" as far as countering fatigue , we tried to get the players into the @entity33 time zone as soon as possible and we adjusted training loads to avoid the injury risks associated with long - haul flying and pre-season training			1
" we monitored the players heavily so we knew exactly who was coping with the heat / travel / training and who was n't so we 'd like to think the injury risk was minimized			0
" @entity48 stars better get used to spending more of their time out in @entity33 -- the financial opportunities appear to be just too great to ignore			1
" the support shown to us since we arrived in @entity227 , @entity5 and now @entity297 has been incredible , " said the @entity3 spokeswoman			0
" tens of thousands of supporters have attended our activities and pre-season matches on tour in @entity227 and @entity5 , and our first fixture in @entity304 in @entity297 has already sold out days ahead of the fixture			0
" " a new generation of supporters in each country is able to interact with the club first hand , and we hope that builds a connection that lasts for many years to come			0
as @entity315 sports business expert @entity314 points out for most @entity48 clubs less than 10 % of the annual turnover comes from overseas sales , which means there is plenty of potential growth abroad			1
" overseas markets are potentially an important source of sustainable revenues , " said @entity314			0
" however , most clubs lack either the expertise or the infrastructure to capitalize upon these revenues , plus there is a physical limit to the amount of business a club can do overseas			2
" they simply ca n't go and play in @entity333 each week where direct player / club relations are the most important point of engagement for fans in places like @entity333			2
" that 's interesting , as it hints at the potential development of globally franchised clubs in the future as we 've seen with @entity345 in the @entity346			2
" which means the " @entity25 " better keep on running because that @entity3 coach is likely to be soon back in @entity4 .			0
