-- when president @entity2 said this weekend that bombing @entity4 targets is the right thing to do , and then asked @entity6 to approve it , the international crisis took a turn toward a fierce domestic battle			1
there are so many moving parts to this complicated story that it can become quite difficult to keep up			0
let this q&a bring you up to speed on the dizzying developments			0
is the @entity16 going to war with @entity4 ? no -- at least not yet			1
even though @entity2 said he wants to strike @entity4 targets after the regime allegedly used chemical weapons on a rebel stronghold last month , he says he wants to wait for @entity6 ' blessing first			1
when will @entity6 decide ? not anytime soon			2
lawmakers wo n't be back in @entity24 until september 9			1
but the @entity25 says it 'll hold a hearing on @entity4 this tuesday			2
ca n't lawmakers be called in earlier ? they can , for an emergency debate			0
but @entity2 said he wo n't ask for that			1
gen. @entity31 , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , says it 's fine to wait			0
according to officials , @entity31 told the president a delay wo n't jeopardize a military strike			1
will @entity6 support @entity2 ? @entity2 might be able to count on the @entity25 , where the @entity38 hold a slim majority			1
the question is , will the @entity42 - dominated @entity41 go along ? lawmakers agree that @entity4 president @entity45 's alleged use of chemical weapons is a travesty			1
but they also do n't want a repeat of @entity49			1
where exactly does the hesitation lie ? some , like @entity42 sen. @entity52 , say the @entity16 should act only if there 's a clear threat to its national security			2
others , like @entity42 senators @entity57 and @entity59 , say airstrikes wo n't go far enough			1
they want @entity45 removed from power			0
does @entity2 really have to wait for @entity6 ' green light ? technically , no. the 1973 @entity63 allows the president to launch military action , but he must notify @entity6 within 48 hours			1
but just because he can does n't mean he will			0
" while i believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective , " he said saturday			0
" we should have this debate , because the issues are too big for business as usual			0
" but did n't he order airstrikes in @entity77 in 2011 without congressional approval ? how is @entity4 different ? in @entity77 , the @entity16 was backing @entity80 action			1
in @entity4 's case , there 's been no @entity84 resolution calling for an intervention			2
if the @entity16 goes in , it would be going in unilaterally			2
what 's the @entity84 saying ? @entity84 @entity89 ban ki - moon says he 'll go before the @entity84 after a team of @entity84 inspectors -- who 've been on the ground investigating the alleged attack -- presents its report			0
but it could take the team up to three weeks to analyze the evidence			0
and even then , it 'll only say if there was a chemical attack , not who was behind it			0
so would the @entity16 really have no foreign support ? @entity104 prime minister @entity103 called for military action against @entity4 -- only to have his hopes quashed when lawmakers narrowly voted it down			1
@entity110 ministers will meet monday to discuss @entity4 , and hold a debate two days later			2
" @entity110 can not act alone , " its interior minister said sunday			0
" we need a coalition			0
" @entity117 foreign minister @entity116 said the time gained waiting for @entity16 congressional approval " must be used to reach a common position of the international community within the @entity84			2
" in another tweet , he said that the results from the @entity84 inspectors ' visit to @entity4 " must be sped up			2
" how do @entity16 feel ? a poll released last week showed almost 80 % of @entity16 think @entity2 should get congressional approval first			1
and after his announcement saturday , anti-war protests sprouted up across the country -- including one in @entity131 that drew hundreds			0
how does it feel about all of this ? the @entity4 government has said it did n't use chemical weapons in the august 21 attack			1
it says jihadists fighting alongside @entity4 rebels used them to turn global sentiment against the regime			2
@entity4 's prime minister says the country 's army is on " maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges			1
" what about the @entity4 opposition ? a major @entity4 opposition group , the @entity155 , said it was disappointed by @entity2 wanting @entity6 ' permission			1
" we ca n't understand how you can promise to help those who are being slaughtered every day in the hundreds , giving them false hope , then change your mind and say ' let 's wait and see , ' " the group told @entity0			0
and the @entity165 in @entity4 , another opposition group , lamented the notion that a @entity16 strike would be limited			1
" a limited strike to merely warn @entity45 today will lead to nothing but his increase in violence , as well as to his complete confidence that no one would prevent him from killing , " the group said in a statement			0
" in the end , no one will pay the price but the @entity4 people			2
" how exactly would @entity16 carry out an attack ? no one is calling for boots on the ground			2
five @entity16 warships with @entity186 cruise missiles are waiting in the @entity187			2
the @entity186 has a range of about 1,000 miles			0
it can loiter over targets , circling for hours , and can be reprogrammed midflight to change course			0
yes , each costs about $ 1.2 million , but they can be fired from quite a distance			0
this means no one has to get within range of @entity4 fire			0
could @entity4 strike back ? @entity4 has some anti-ship missiles -- but they have a range of only 62 to 186 miles , says @entity201 , a senior analyst at @entity202 's			1
it also has a number of scuds and similar surface - to - surface weapons , but these are not designed to be used against moving targets such as @entity16 warships , @entity201 said			1
how are the neighbors reacting ? security is tight in @entity211 , where one in six is now a @entity4 refugee			0
in @entity214 , there 's been a rush on gas masks because residents fear that @entity4 could target @entity214 for retaliation			0
and @entity219 , a key @entity220 ally , says it wo n't be a launchpad for a strike			1
this is all a lot to digest			0
a @entity16 strike against @entity4 is not imminent			1
and even though @entity2 can launch a military attack unilaterally , he 'd prefer to have @entity6 ' approval first			1
@entity0 's @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , and @entity240 contributed to this report .			0

@entity6 wo n't be back until september 9
poll : 80 % of @entity16 feel @entity2 needs @entity6 ' permission
some decry the alleged chemical weapons attacks , but do n't want another @entity49
@entity4 says it is ready to confront any challenge
