for families dealing with rare diseases , the road to a diagnosis is a long , winding one , riddled with confusion , complications and expenses			1
although pop culture has left an impression that there is a genius doctor somewhere , like the fictional dr. @entity50 who can identify and cure rare diseases , the reality is far different			1
after the diagnosis , the lack of answers or effective treatment can be completely unsatisfying			0
" two - thirds of the people with rare diseases are children , because these are genetic diseases , " said @entity57 , the vice president for communications at the @entity59			1

maybe , one of the doctor speculated , @entity4 had @entity125 syndrome , a rare childhood genetic disease			1
another doctor suggested it could be @entity129 , another rare vascular disease that causes malformations and has only been found in 80 people			1
another doctor thought it could be a combination of both diseases , possibly a new condition			2

@entity187 sees about 30 cases a year at the hospital			2
the way @entity4 presented with the disease was so unusual @entity187 said he has only seen it in two other patients			1

it 's a rare form of @entity215 , and the one that is most dangerous because it grows very quickly			2

the muscles , tendons and bones in @entity4 's right leg are being infiltrated , @entity187 said			1
there is no cure for the disease , which is often the case when dealing with rare diagnoses			2

but the homecoming has been overshadowed by a looming medical decision			0
" we have been going back and forth , " she said			0
" do we tell them to take the leg ? is he going to be mad at us when he gets older ? " her husband added that when they first learned of the malformation during pregnancy , they were given two options : abort @entity4 or give birth and see what happens			1
" that was an easy decision on our part , " he said			0
" this whole leg amputation , it has been left up to us			2
that 's a tough decision because the decisions we have to make have nothing to do with us			0
it 's for the betterment of him			0
do we leave the leg and hope someone can fix it three or four years down the line ? "			2
