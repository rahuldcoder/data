@entity0 -- in case you had n't noticed , @entity0 is in the midst of a revolution			1
a new president , an economic meltdown			2
president @entity9 needs to take another look at the rules on lobbyists , @entity8 says			1
and , in short order , the following solutions proposed and implemented : an extensive bank bailout , a huge plan to salvage the careening housing market , a gargantuan $ 787 billion economic stimulus package			0
big news , bigger headlines			0
more quietly though , there 's this side of the @entity9 revolution : a plan to rid @entity0 of the outsize influence of all lobbyists			1
make sure they 're not a part of that evil revolving door , running the government agencies they once lobbied			2
and also make sure that lobbyists left on the outside do n't unduly influence the new folks running the place			1
translated ( Ã  la campaign jargon ) that means : the days of crony government are over			0
the insiders are no longer in charge			0
good for you -- except it 's not			2
this side of the @entity9 revolution has fallen prey to the laws of unintended consequences : first , the administration is discovering it ca n't get itself up and running without calling on some people with much - needed expertise			1
( see also : vacancies in top levels of almost every department			0
) next , there 's a revolt brewing among lobbyists ( including the so - called do - gooders ) who say they 're being denied both government jobs as well as the constitutional right to petition just because they have " lobbied " in the past			1
the insanity is that these rules are now dangerously close to creating a problem for effective governance			1
here 's the dirty little secret : those who lobby on specific issues are often the most knowledgeable on those issues			1
and they 're getting shut out , no matter which side they 're on			0
that 's why @entity74 , the president of the @entity75 of @entity76 , sent out a call to arms to fellow lobbyists recently			1
seems the president signed a memo that laid out restrictions on the contacts between lobbyists and government officials in connection with the stimulus package -- including restrictions on telephone calls and meetings about individual project proposals			1
the goal may be full transparency in government , but the result could be chaos			0
sure , the president wants the stimulus money to go only to worthy projects , but why not be allowed to get some help in navigating the government bureaucracy ? in the end , these groups say , the process could move slower , not faster			2
after all , why keep a mayor from turning to a lobbyist who knows the system for help ? in a strange marriage , the @entity108 has joined with the lobbyists to declare this all constitutionally unacceptable			2
as @entity74 writes , " there is an emerging pattern of industry segregation , discrimination , and actions that skirt the boundaries of our constitutional right to simply ' do our jobs			0
' enough is enough ! ? " so the revolutionary president has a revolt on his hands			2
from @entity123 and moderate @entity124 , on policy -- and from the permanent citizens of @entity0 's bureaucracy , the lobbyists			1
@entity9 officials will tell you that it 's what they expected ; change is never easy , after all			1
and they stand firm , taking some solace in history : in 1981 - 82 , the @entity136 came and did n't turn the country around quickly			2
the @entity123 got crushed in the 1982 midterm elections , but the president won a landslide in 1984			0
and president @entity141 overreached on health care in 1993 , and his party was swept out of control of the @entity145 in 1994			0
but by 1996 , he won re-election easily			0
now comes @entity9 , who is rolling the dice , just as @entity141 predicted during the campaign -- on everything			1
and now that his own revolution is in gear , it 's caused even some of his most ardent supporters to revolt			0
worse , yet , it 's hurting the staffing of his own government			0
sure , change is what @entity9 called for , and it 's clearly needed			1
but even revolutions need to be recalibrated once in a while			0

@entity8 : president @entity9 needs to *rethink* *crackdown* on lobbyists ' influence
@entity0 's dirty little secret : lobbyists are knowledgeable on issues , @entity8 says
tough rules on lobbyists creating problems for effective governance , she says
@entity8 : administration ca n't get up and running without needed expertise
