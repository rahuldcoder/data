-- let the naming and shaming begin			0
@entity2 will start to point the finger at its top ten most air - polluted cities -- each and every month -- in the hopes that national humiliation will push positive environmental action			1
a parallel list of the nation 's ten cities with best air qualities will also be published			1
@entity14 's political -- and very public -- pressure on its most polluted cities comes within a year of the capital reporting its worst air quality levels in recorded history and an @entity20 study showing seven of the world 's top ten most air - polluted cities were in @entity2			1
" we must put air quality control as an ecological red line for economic management and social development , " said @entity2 's vice premier @entity25 , in a statement			1
on wednesday , he announced the new policy at the 18th @entity33 in @entity14			0
" air pollution control is a long , arduous and complex mission			1
we need to highlight the control of major polluted cities and strengthen the reduction and management of various polluters , " added @entity25			1
@entity2 officials did not say when the first list would be announced , but the northern megacities of @entity14 and @entity44 , as well as the surrounding provinces of @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 have signed onto an official plan to speed up air pollution control measures			1
this past august , an official environmental assessment found these six regions to be @entity2 's most polluted			2
" i think the policy is a very good inspirational mechanism , especially for those cities on the ' shaming ' list , so that they can work to get off the list quicker , " said @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 at @entity57 , to @entity0			0
" however , it is not enough to rank those cities			0
it 's also important to control energy , especially coal consumption			0
some cities did n't clarify how much they are going to reduce their coal consumption			0
the lack of a number makes us worried that there wo n't be any dramatic change in terms of air quality			2
" earlier this month , the central government said it would stop approving coal - fired power plants in more heavily polluted industrial areas			2
it also announced a national blueprint to lower the concentration of harmful particles in the air -- much of it caused by the burning of coal -- by at least 10 % between 2012 and 2017 levels			0
in heavily polluted areas , including @entity2 's north , targets will be more stringent			2
@entity14 , @entity44 and @entity46 , all signatories to this week 's new air pollution control plan , aim to cut particles by 25 %			1
in southern @entity2 's @entity98 , across the border from @entity97 , the goal is 15 %			2
" we know high - ranking officials really want to tackle the ( air pollution ) problem but in reality how much does this help ? " said @entity99 , ceo of the @entity100 in @entity97 , to @entity0			1
" it all might be more symbolic because when you look at the regional or local level , growth is measured by @entity110 , not by how environmental the city has become			0
i 'm not too optimistic , " added @entity99			0
@entity2 is the world 's largest consumer of coal by volume and will continue to be for years , relying on the fossil fuel for 70 - 80 % of its energy needs , according to various experts and the @entity120			1
much of that energy goes towards electricity for factories and for winter heating			0
@entity14 says it hopes to reduce the nation 's coal consumption to 65 % by 2017			2
in comparison , @entity127 draws about 75 % of its electricity from coal , according to the @entity131			0
the @entity132 generated 37 % of its electricity from coal in 2012 , according to the @entity135			0
as people in @entity2 have grown wealthier , they have increased demands on the government for a cleaner environment			0
this past july , a landmark study by @entity2 and international academics revealed that severe pollution and toxic air slashed an average of five and a half years of life expectancy for residents of northern @entity2			1
according to a recent @entity57 report , 83,500 people died prematurely in 2011 from respiratory diseases in @entity49 , @entity48 and @entity47 -- @entity2 's top three coal - consuming provinces .			1

@entity2 to name and shame top ten worst - polluting cities each month
' air quality control is ecological red line , ' says @entity2 *vice-premier*
@entity14 , @entity44 , cities in northern provinces have signed plan to speed up air pollution control
seven of world 's top ten most air - polluted cities in @entity2 , says @entity20 report
