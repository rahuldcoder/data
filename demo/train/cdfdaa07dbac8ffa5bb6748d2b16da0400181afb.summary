-- four years ago , @entity3 's gesture - tracking @entity2 system proved the power of motion controls to extend the mainstream appeal of video games			1
now @entity8 and @entity9 are readying their own motion - sensing solutions			1
but will these user interfaces be novel enough to move gaming fans en masse ? launching september 17 , ( $ 99.99 starter bundle ) the wand - like @entity15 claims to offer greater precision than the @entity2 remote when translating gamers ' physical movements into on - screen actions			1
debuting november 4 , @entity8 's @entity22 ( $ 149.99 starter bundle ) , employs a @entity24 camera that makes your body the controller and eliminates the need for handheld hardware			2
each aims to broaden the appeal of the @entity32 and @entity33 , respectively			0
but despite their high price tags ( roughly $ 300 - $ 400 total , including accessories ) , both are betting their chips on their appeal to casual gamers			1
initial software offerings clearly reflect this sentiment , with a range of virtual pets , mini-game collections and sports - themed games			2
it seems a strange fit , because their steep costs are likely to limit early sales largely to current system owners -- most of whom are die - hard gamers			0
@entity9 hopes to bridge the gap by supporting traditional games , ranging from military shooter " @entity59 : @entity60 " to colorful platform - hopper " @entity61			1
" for now , @entity8 is mostly leaving third - party publishers such as @entity64 and @entity65 to fight this battle instead			1
on the bright side , both move and @entity22 deliver on user friendliness and accessibility in hands - on tests			0
but neither seems to offer any must - have titles or even anything that expands greatly on previously explored @entity2 game concepts , making it difficult to justify the upgrade			1
early game offerings hint at the hardware 's grand possibilities			0
but with few reasons for shoppers to buy , beyond first - adopter bragging rights , there 's also little incentive for software makers to raise the bar			0
developers need time to gauge these units ' capabilities and come to grips with the vast differences between developing for 2 - @entity94 playing fields			0
as a result , we 'll likely see games which offer only passing glimpses of these gizmos ' potential for the next several months			0
one also has to wonder why sales of the @entity2 and supporting game software are finally slowing			2
is consumer interest in motion - controlled gaming cooling ? is the novelty of gesture - tracking fading as developers struggle to invent novel applications ? or does everyone who wants a @entity2 already own one ? some observers even question whether exhausting yourself flailing around with so - called " active " games is really preferable to issuing commands by pressing buttons -- as evidenced by the thousands of @entity117 gathering dust in people 's closets			1
of this fall 's two big new offerings , it 's @entity22 that appears to offer the most potential -- but , curiously , not for its gaming features			2
@entity8 's system also supports living - room videoconferencing and lets you browse menus and multimedia with spoken commands or a wave of the hand , which seems like a natural way to make everyday electronics more accessible to people			1
so it 's too early in the game to predict how either move or @entity22 will fare			0
but there 's still reason to be thankful for both			0
by delaying the release of new @entity32 or @entity145 consoles , they 're sparing us the cost and headaches of replacing our current hardware .			0

@entity8 and @entity9 are releasing motion - sensing gaming systems this fall
the @entity2 proved motion controls ' power to extend video games ' mainstream appeal
despite systems ' high price tags , both companies counting on appeal to casual *enthusiasts*
