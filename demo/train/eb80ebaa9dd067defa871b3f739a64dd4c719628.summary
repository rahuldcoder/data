-- federal accident investigators tuesday pinned blame for a 2013 @entity4 cargo plane crash in @entity5 squarely on the pilots , but some members saved caustic criticism for @entity4 , saying the company could have taken steps to prevent the deadly crash			1
" yes , the pilots flew the airplane into the ground , there 's no question , " said @entity13 member @entity12 , a former airline pilot			1
though the @entity13 did not blame @entity4 in its formal report , @entity12 pointedly told cargo company representatives : " you have got problems			1
" in a three - hour meeting in @entity25 , the @entity13 cited a litany of errors the pilots made : the captain failed to correctly program an aircraft computer , failed to monitor the plane 's altitude , did n't relay important information to his co-pilot , and failed to abort the landing when it became apparent the plane was in trouble			1
the first officer , meanwhile , failed to communicate altitudes to the pilot as the plane approached @entity43			2
in a conversation captured on the plane 's cockpit voice recorder , the co-pilot also confessed to being fatigued , evidently after failing to use her off - duty time to get appropriate rest			1
both pilots died in the pre-dawn incident august 13 , 2013 , when the @entity51 crashed a short distance from the @entity43 runway			0
but @entity12 said @entity4 also failed to take actions that could have prevented the crash			1
the global delivery company did not update software on a ground proximity warning system , which could have given the crew an earlier indication they were too close to the ground , he said			0
if @entity4 officials had an @entity65 , " i guarantee they would keep their software up to date , " yet they failed to update software on a plane carrying two of its employees , he said			1
a @entity4 official called @entity12 's claim " the speculative opinion of one member , " saying the company 's software met @entity75 standards , and that there is no evidence the upgrade would have prevented the accident			1
" based on the rate of descent of this particular aircraft , it would be impossible to determine whether a software upgrade would have made a difference , " capt. @entity82 , @entity4 director of airline safety , told @entity0			1
he noted that the @entity13 does not cite the software in its official finding			2
@entity12 said the cargo carrier also did not provide all of the available weather information to the pilots			0
as a result , the pilots likely expected to see the airport after descending below clouds at 1,000 feet , but did n't clear the clouds until 350 feet			0
" @entity4 does is about efficiency			2
they have guys running around with clipboards and stopwatches to make sure if an airplane is a minute late , someone will be held accountable for it			0
but the sad thing here -- this ( technology ) could have possibly prevented this accident			0
" " if you 're interested in efficiency , i can guarantee you on august 14 of last year , those packages on the airplanes did not get delivered by 10:30 in the morning , " @entity12 said			0
@entity4 ' @entity116 acknowleged that known information about the cloud ceiling was not relayed to the pilots			1
but , he said , the pilots had been given a forecast that included a variable cloud ceiling , giving the pilots enough to plan and execute their approach			0
@entity13 : no distress call prior to @entity4 cargo plane crash in @entity5 the board said the captain did not have a stabilized approach -- meaning the plane 's speed , direction and descent were not within established standards -- in the final minutes			1
it was the same problem that led to the 2013 crash of an @entity138 jetliner in @entity139			0
" an unstabilized approach is a less safe approach , " said @entity13 acting chairman @entity140			2
" when an approach is unstable , there is no shame in playing it safe by going around and trying again			0
" the @entity147 aviation industry has closely watched the @entity4 crash investigation largely because it highlights different @entity75 standards for commercial and cargo aircraft			2
in january of this year , the @entity75 required additional rest hours for commercial pilots , but it exempted cargo pilots			0
cargo pilots say rest rules should be uniform , regardless of the type of aircraft flown			0
wednesday , the @entity13 concluded the pilots of @entity159 had been given an adequate opportunity to rest , even under the rule that applies to commercial pilots			1
the rule did not make a difference in this case , the board said			0
@entity4 pilots complained of fatigue before fatal crash asked if the @entity4 culture encourages pilots to call in fatigued when they are tired , 91 % " strongly disagreed " or " somewhat disagreed , " according to a survey conducted in march by the @entity173 , a union that represents @entity4 pilots			1
" you probably have some bias in here as it was issued by a ( union ) , " @entity12 said			0
" but when you have 2,202 people responding to that , they are trying to tell you something			0
" @entity4 spokesman @entity182 said the union was " politicizing " the investigation in an effort to change pilot work hours			2
@entity4 pilots typically work 70 hours a month -- 30 in the air , @entity182 said , less than the 55 hours the typical commercial pilot flies			2
the safety board approved more than 20 recommendations , including one that board member @entity190 called " ground - breaking " that would require warnings about flying fatigued during pre-flight briefings on overnight flights .			1

in 3 - hour meeting , @entity13 cites a litany of errors the pilots made
@entity13 : captain failed to correctly program computer or monitor plane 's altitude , more
but @entity4 has also " got problems " and must " get them cleaned up , " says @entity13 board member
