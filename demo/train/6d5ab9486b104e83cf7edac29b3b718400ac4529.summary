more than a decade after concluding a fuel tank explosion destroyed @entity3 , senior @entity1 accident investigators stood their ground on tuesday against skeptics claiming new evidence suggests missile fire downed the jumbo jet			1
" i 'm totally convinced there was no bomb or missile , " @entity10 investigator @entity9 told reporters at a briefing outside @entity13			1
skeptics , including a former @entity10 investigator , last month petitioned the agency to re-open its investigation and will release a documentary on the crash this month			1
conspiracy theories , outrage swirl around @entity3 plane they said evidence suggests one or more missiles destroyed the @entity30 - bound @entity29 over the @entity31 shortly after takeoff from @entity33 on july 17 , 1996 , killing all 230 on board			1
the safety board has responded cautiously , saying it is having investigators who were not part of the original investigation review the petition			1
and it is seeking comment from @entity42 , the @entity43 , and other parties to the original probe			0
but at the same time , the board allowed the original @entity48 800 investigators to brief the media on the four - year investigation			1
under orders to address only matters in the original investigation , the investigators nonetheless emphasized topics that have come under question by the critics			1
they held up two sheet metal plates showing examples of bomb and high - velocity missile damage , and then took reporters to view @entity48 800 's reconstructed fuselage			1
they said they found no pitting of the type alleged by those challenging the findings			0
" you do n't see fragmented seat parts , " said investigator @entity70			0
nor is there evidence of pitting , cratering or " gas jetting " -- tell - tale marks left by high explosives -- he said			0
plane reconstructed investigators said they were unable to find any evidence on radar of a missile intercepting the plane			1
and they discounted the significance of traces of explosives found on more than 100 airplane parts pulled from the ocean			0
the @entity10 said tests showed that explosive residue washes off after only two days in the ocean , leading them to conclude the residue likely was the result of contamination from the military and law enforcement boats that recovered wreckage			1
the @entity10 allowed two @entity3 family members to attend the briefing , and the family members reiterated their support for the board 's findings			2
@entity105 , whose sister @entity107 , a 23 - year - old flight attendant , was killed in the explosion , said the briefing " solidified " his belief that the original investigation was " complete , accurate and thorough			1
" @entity111 , whose son @entity112 , 29 , died on the flight , also endorsed the @entity10 finding			1
" at first i was of course skeptical as everybody else			0
you know , you just did n't know what happened			0
as things unfolded , it seemed to make a lot of sense , what happened to the plane , " he said			0
" it 's really cut and dry , at this point , as far as i 'm concerned			0
" @entity105 and @entity111 said the new attention to the crash is opening old wounds			2
" it 's really a shame in my book , " @entity111 said			0
" there are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb and i respect their thoughts and however they want to view it			2
it 's just the way you take the information and how you process it and who you believe			0
and i believe the @entity10 has done a job and i do n't believe they 've covered up anything and i do n't believe the @entity146 did either			2
" the @entity10 did not allow their critics into the media briefing			1
they talked to reporters in a parking lot outside			0
opinion : flight 800 conspiracy ? where 's the proof ? ' a matter of conscience ' @entity157 , a former @entity10 investigator who now doubts the board 's conclusion , said he is motivated only by a desire to uncover the truth			1
@entity157 said following the accident , he spent two days with @entity111			2
" that 's the last guy in the world i 'd want to hurt , " he said			0
" there 's no profit motive			0
it 's a matter of conscience and integrity as far as we 're concerned			0
two hundred and thirty people were killed and that 's a tragedy that ca n't be ignored , " @entity157 said			0
@entity157 is featured in the documentary , called " @entity3 , " co-produced by longtime skeptic @entity174			2
the @entity10 investigators on tuesday repeated a scenario the safety board endorsed in 2000			1
the series of events leading to @entity3 's disastrous final flight began when it was delayed at @entity33 's @entity183 airport			1
while the plane was sitting at the gate , the crew engaged the plane 's air conditioner to keep passengers cool			0
the air conditioning units , low in the plane 's fuselage , heated the large , nearly empty fuel tank above it , creating a volatile fuel / air mixture			1
ten minutes after take - off , when the plane was at 13,700 feet and climbing , an electrical short that likely occurred in a wire bundle pushed a high - voltage current into the fuel tank , igniting it , and destroying the plane			1
divers found three overlapping fields of debris at the bottom of the ocean			0
the first included the pieces of the fuel tank and the cabin above it			1
a second field contained the nose and cockpit			0
the final and largest debris field contained the rest of the plane			0
investigators said they worked hard to determine if a bomb or missile was involved , especially in light of the event 's timing two days before the @entity221 and 10 days before the @entity223 bombing in @entity224			2
" that really intensified the investigation , " said investigator @entity225			2
a cockpit voice recorder analysis showed a sound spectrum consistent with a low - explosive fuel tank explosion , not a high - explosive missile			1
eventually , investigators ruled out a missile or bomb , as well as lightning , meteor , electro - magnetic pulse , and other possible causes , @entity225 said			2
@entity225 acknowledged some friction between the @entity10 and the @entity146 during the investigation , but said " it did n't ultimately harm the investigation			1
" @entity225 said the petition has not prompted him to rethink the board 's 2000 findings			0
since the petition was filed , @entity225 said , he has re-read this report " a couple more times and it 's pretty thorough			0
" five facts to calm plane crash fears			2
