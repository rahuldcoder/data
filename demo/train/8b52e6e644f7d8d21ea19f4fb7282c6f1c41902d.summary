-- it was another bad day at the office for @entity3 as he shot a two - over - par 74 in his opening round at the @entity5 thursday			1
the @entity8 @entity7 event , often referred to as the " fifth major , " is worth a cool $ 9.5 million but @entity3 is unlikely to taste any of that bounty having already fallen nine shots off leaders @entity11 and @entity13			1
world number seven @entity14 , a 14 - time major champion who still dreams of breaking @entity18 ' record of 18 , endured a torrid time as he seeks to return to the consistency that made him virtually unbeatable a few years back			2
the 36 - year - old broke a 17 - month drought in march with victory at @entity25 but came to @entity26 -- where his only win was back in 2001 -- in poor form having missed the cut at @entity30 , only the eighth time that has happened in his career			1
@entity3 hits back at his critics but after another bad opening round @entity3 may well miss the cut again			1
" it was n't certainly the most positive start , " @entity3 told reporters			1
" any kind of momentum that i would build , i would shoot myself in the foot on the very next hole			0
just one of those days			0
" i did n't get a lot out of that round			2
i just did n't score			0
i hit decent shots in there and just got some of the worst lies			2
" @entity5 leaderboard @entity3 had claimed before @entity30 that he had put his problem swing behind him and was slowly building back towards something approaching his best			1
" just be patient with it			0
just keep plugging along , " he said			0
" in the last few months , i 've put together some good rounds , won a couple tournaments , so it 's there			0
i just need to continue doing it			0
" meanwhile the man who was once lambasted for suggesting -- while @entity3 was at the peak of his powers and seemingly untouchable -- that he could one day challenge golf 's most enigmatic player is leading the tournament			1
@entity11 shot a magnificent seven - under 65 , dropping just one shot the entire round			1
" it felt real solid , " the @entity66 told the @entity7 's official website			0
" i got off to a nice start , hit a few good shots early on ... then four birdies in a row from nine			2
" and the secret of @entity11 's round ? according to the @entity66 it was to play less golf			1
" i 've been busy at home , new house to move in to , stuff to occupy my mind , " he explained			0
" and when i have n't been ( moving house ) , i 've been hitting some balls ... my time on the range has been a small but concentrated effort			0
" @entity11 was joined at the top by @entity85 's @entity13 , who also birdied the notoriously difficult " island " par - three 17th hole -- which cost two - time major champion @entity87 nine shots on thursday			1
@entity13 , , a two - time winner on the @entity91 whose last victory came at @entity25 in 2011 , completed a flawless round to be one shot clear of @entity8 @entity95			2
compatriots @entity96 and @entity98 both finished with five - under 67s , while @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity103 's @entity102 were in a group of 11 players on 68 .			0

@entity3 *slumps* to a two - over *72* in first round of @entity5
now seven shots off first round leader @entity11
woods in *danger* of missing second cut in a row
@entity11 claims success comes from playing less golf
