-- one of the most high - profile appointments president @entity2 will make in his second term is the director of the @entity5			1
here 's a tip for the president : the time is ripe for the first woman to head the agency			1
choosing a woman is n't just about narrowing the intelligence community gender gap			2
it 's also about drawing from the whole pool of talent to ensure the best national security apparatus and responding to @entity18 ' apparent desire for more women in government			1
here are the @entity22 reasons president @entity2 should name a woman as the next @entity5 director			1
1 ) it would inspire more women to enter the fields of foreign policy and intelligence			1
the intelligence and foreign policy community is predominantly male			0
according to a 2009 report published by women in @entity35 , women comprise about 13 % of the @entity36 , and between 21 % and 29 % of key agencies that grapple with national security matters , like the @entity18 @entity39 and @entity18 @entity40			1
2 ) the november 6 elections showed @entity18 want to see more women in senior government positions			1
women make up 20 % of the @entity46 , a historic high			0
overall , the next @entity48 will have almost 100 women			0
3 ) women at the @entity5 are increasingly playing significant behind - the - scenes counterterrorism roles			1
women were instrumental in the hunt for @entity54			0
@entity55 , the first chief of the @entity5 's first unit focused on tracking @entity54 , has noted that female intelligence analysts were integral in the first captures of senior @entity60 leaders after 9/11			1
in his book " @entity62 , " @entity60 expert and @entity0 national security analyst @entity64 writes , " the prominent role that women played in the hunt for @entity54 was reflective of the largest cultural shift at the @entity5 in the past two decades			1
" @entity69 : tough choice for @entity2 on @entity72 ' successor 4 ) appointing a woman could assist on the public relations front			1
the reputations of the intelligence and defense communities have been somewhat tarnished by events surrounding the resignation of cia director @entity72 and the investigation of gen. @entity81 ; a big change at the top could help			2
5 ) it 's a high - profile moment to appoint a woman as director			2
pop culture reflects today 's obsession with national security and intelligence issues			2
media coverage of @entity72 ' resignation and the attacks on the @entity96 consulate have fueled this interest			0
the movies " @entity99 , " " @entity100 " and the upcoming " @entity101 " about the hunt for @entity54 , as well as @entity104 's " homeland , " have fed into the fascination with spying			0
too bad the most - watched woman in national security , " @entity103 's " protagonist @entity107 , is fictional			2
6 ) motivating more women to join the community is a national security issue : staying safe in a world with increasingly complex and transmuting threats requires intelligence leaders to recruit the best and brightest ; tapping half the population is n't enough			2
7 ) more women in senior intelligence and national security positions could have a positive impact in unanticipated ways			2
in general , diversity can help temper group - think , generate innovative problem - solving , bring new issues to the agenda and change meeting dynamics for the better			0
8 ) plenty of women are qualified for this role			0
some examples : former rep. @entity132 , head of the @entity133 and former ranking @entity134 on the @entity135 ; @entity136 , secretary of homeland security ; sen. @entity137 , chairwoman of the @entity138 ; @entity139 , secretary of state ; @entity140 , former secretary of state ; @entity141 , former director of policy planning at the @entity39 ; @entity142 , former under secretary of defense for policy and @entity144 , former homeland and counterterrorism adviser to president @entity146 and a @entity0 contributor , to name a few			0
of course , many other senior women with less name recognition from within the intelligence community would be excellent candidates			0
9 ) women hold the top post in many other countries and it 's time for the @entity18 to catch up			1
women hold the highest office , as president or prime minister , in @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and many other countries			0
@entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , and many others have had women serve in those positions			0
the @entity18 is still behind on this front and has another four years before this even becomes a possibility			0
10 ) once a woman is appointed to a top position , it opens the door to others with immense talent			0
since president @entity188 appointed @entity189 to serve as the first female @entity18 secretary of state , @entity140 and @entity139 followed			2
in a recent @entity193 article titled " the @entity5 's @entity194 , " @entity191 writes : " the @entity18 has never had anyone but white men run the ( @entity5 ) , the @entity40 , or the @entity197 -- an increasingly absurd and shameful record			1
" a woman at the helm of the @entity5 would n't simply make another crack in the intelligence glass ceiling , it could effectively shatter it			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			0

@entity207 says president @entity2 should appoint a woman as head of the @entity5
she says it would inspire more women to join an agency dominated by men
@entity207 : @entity18 want more women in government , and many women are highly qualified
it 's time for a change as women play more and more prominent roles in intelligence , she says
