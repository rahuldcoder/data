-- former @entity2 sen. and @entity4 presidential candidate @entity3 has a well - known @entity6 problem			1
for the uninitiated , if you @entity10 's name , the first result you 'll probably get is not his personal website but a fake definition of " santorum , " a sexual byproduct that 's a bit too graphic to talk about in detail here			1
( of course , you can @entity6 him and easily find out			0
) we 'll get into how that all happened in a second , but here 's what 's new : on tuesday , the socially conservative politician lashed out at @entity6 , saying the company could get rid of the sexual references to his name on the search results if it wanted to -- and perhaps would do so if he were a @entity29			1
" i suspect if something was up there like that about @entity35 , they 'd get rid of it , " he told @entity30			0
" if you 're a responsible business , you do n't let things like that happen in your business that have an impact on the country			0
" he continued : " to have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they ca n't handle , but i suspect that 's not true			0
" @entity10 contacted @entity6 and asked the company about the issue , @entity30 said			1
in an e-mail to @entity0 , a @entity6 spokeswoman said , " @entity6 's search results are a reflection of the content and information that is available on the @entity61			1
users who want content removed from the @entity64 should contact the webmaster of the page directly			0
once the webmaster takes the page down from the @entity61 , it will be removed from @entity6 's search results through our usual crawling process			1
" she added : " we do not remove content from our search results , except in very limited cases such as illegal content and violations of our webmaster guidelines			1
" @entity10 is just the latest to gripe at @entity6 over how it ranks search results			1
the ceo of @entity79 posted a blog tuesday saying that @entity6 purposefully ranks its own products -- like @entity82 -- above its competitors			0
" we believe @entity6 has acted anti-competitively in at least two key ways : by misusing @entity79 review content in their competing places product and by favoring their own competing places product in search results , " @entity79 's @entity85 wrote			1
@entity6 ceo @entity92 was scheduled to testify before @entity93 on wednesday about similar antitrust complaints			0
the lewd " santorum " definition popped up after the former senator compared homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality in a 2003 interview with the @entity103 : " in every society , the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality , " he said			0
" that 's not to pick on homosexuality			0
it 's not , you know , man on child , man on dog , or whatever the case may be			0
" that angered gay rights supporters , including gay podcast host and sex columnist @entity121 , who launched a campaign for his listeners to redefine @entity10 's name			1
@entity121 created a website to promote the winning definition ( again , you 'll have to search for that elsewhere ) , and enough bloggers linked to it that the spoof site eventually eclipsed @entity10 's campaign website in search rankings			1
@entity135 , who writes at the blog @entity136 , notes that @entity6 has a history of being hands - off when it comes to these controversies , regardless of the politics or sensitivities involved : " @entity6 is loathe to touch its results in any way , shape or form			2
that 's because if it does intervene in any way , there 's some interest group that will immediately claim a bias			0
way back in 2004 , an @entity154 web site started ranking in @entity6 's top results for ' jew			1
' " despite @entity6 co-founder @entity158 being @entity159 and himself disgusted with the result , it stood			0
intervention , when @entity6 's ranking algorithms had spoken , was seen as harmful to user trust , " @entity135 writes			2
in december 2009 , when racist images of first lady @entity166 popped to the top of @entity6 search results , the company took a similar free - speech stance			1
" we have a bias toward free expression , " @entity6 spokesman @entity170 said at the time			0
" that means that some ugly things will show up			0
" still , @entity6 has removed offensive content from searches , usually by making changes to how its overall search equations function			2
in 2007 , for example , a change to @entity6 's search algorithm stopped the search term " miserable failure " from directing @entity64 users to pages about former president @entity187 , according to @entity136			2
it 's worth noting that some of these internet weirdnesses have shown up on other search engines , too , not just on @entity6			2
what do you think about the @entity10 situation ? should @entity6 make changes ? or is the company right to stand by the way its equations rank web pages against each other , by trying to judge their relevance ?			2

@entity30 : @entity3 asks @entity6 to change the search results for his name
a reference to a sex byproduct shows up high in search results for " santorum "
a sex columnist created a spoof site to draw searchers away from @entity10 's page
