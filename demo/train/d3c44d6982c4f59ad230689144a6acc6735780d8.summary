-- when i moved back home , i knew what i was in for			1
my mother tends to nag me			1
she ca n't help it			1
@entity6 is in her nature , and her recent battles with fibromyalgia and a spinal injury have not been easy on her nerves			1
she is uncompromisingly neat , a characteristic that i have not inherited			1
my room is what she fusses about most			2
my junk reminds her that my return was n't something we planned			2
i graduated from college in 2009			2
after traveling for a year on a @entity21 scholarship , i came home to my mother without a clear vision of my career path , let alone prospects afoot			1
according to a recent @entity28 poll , 39 % of 18 - to 34 - year - olds are living with their parents or have moved back in with their parents temporarily because of the sluggish economy			1
sixty - three percent of 18 - to 34 - year - olds know someone who has moved back home			1
these numbers do n't surprise me			2
my generation has been called the " boomerangers , " meaning that young people like me and my friends are nesting with our folks again when we are expected to be independent			1
moving back home has not been easy to swallow			1
it 's more than adjusting to life under the watchful gaze of parents			1
it 's more than feeling anxious about finances			2
after spending my adolescence stressing out over @entity50 classes and college admissions , then dealing with the rigors of university course work , i doffed my graduation cap only to find that somewhere along the line a good education stopped being the finish line			2
facing the job market unsuccessfully has sent me back to the drawing board			1
we boomerangers have a lot to contemplate			2
first , we must decide whether to settle for an occupation less than ideal or pursue interests that we genuinely love but may not be as economically rewarding , at least in the short term			2
my mother 's support has enabled me to do the latter			2
after coming home , i started to intern at a local newspaper and applied to journalism graduate schools			1
with extra time on my hands , i also began to intern at @entity77 , a nearby music store			2
the owner , @entity79 , has more than 4 million 45s , spanning the genre from the @entity82 to the lesser @entity83			0
he and a lone employee , @entity84 , are walking encyclopedias of the rhythm and blues tradition			0
when i 'm at the store , i mostly bask in their knowledge , sort picture sleeves and take notes			0
the experience has placed me knee - deep into a research project on @entity96 's music history			1
my friends ' stories are similar in some ways			0
with entry - level positions more difficult to acquire , many boomerangers are forced to look for alternatives			1
most of my friends are pursuing internships or graduate study			0
and still , we wonder : will this be enough ? my cousin @entity108 juggles two internships at training and development centers along with a third internship at a radio station			0
he is pursuing a career in publicity , but through his excursion into radio has started to develop a programming portfolio			1
@entity119 , a young woman i went to high school with , took over her family 's kitchen last summer in search of the perfect pound cake recipe			1
she 's now planning to get her bakery , @entity125 , off the ground			0
my friend @entity127 searched fruitlessly for a job in advertising before spending two years as a line cook , only to find himself as a visual resources coordinator in the special collections of university libraries			0
while my friends and i have enjoyed our experiences , the current job market has brought a feeling of uncertainty , which has been unsettling			0
in 2009 , a record number of high school students enrolled in colleges			0
while it is good news that more @entity146 are getting a higher education , it also means that competition among young graduates is intensifying			1
we 're left to ponder how to get a leg up			0
as we vie for the same internships and graduate programs , we expect that our student loan debt will become deeper			0
who 's to say when we 'll be able to afford our starter houses ? i can attest that many of my peers are taking time to hone their skills			1
i 've watched them carve out niches for themselves , through internships and sheer will			0
i would say that my friends are all more enriched individuals			0
but the uncertainty still lingers			0
with the changing times , the road to self - reliance and success appears stretched out			1
fortunately , the end of my boomerang season is in sight			0
come autumn , i 'll be enrolled in graduate school			0
my mother and i are both excited			0
she 's thrilled that she 'll finally have my room in order			0
i 'm thrilled that soon i 'll get to make a room of my own			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0

@entity28 poll says 39 % of young adults are living with or have moved back with their parents
@entity185 : i moved back home without a clear vision of my career path or prospects
she says entry - level jobs are hard to get and many of her peers must look for alternatives
@entity185 : the road to self - reliance appears stretched out for her generation
