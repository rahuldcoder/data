@entity0 , @entity1 -- he 's smashed world records and revolutionized running during his illustrious career			1
and yet the name of @entity7 has almost been forgotten			1
the date was february 2 , 1974 and the stage was the men 's 1500 - meter final at the 1974 @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
leading from the start , @entity15 continued at a blistering pace throughout the race to cross the finish line first in a race that 's often described as the greatest middle distance event of all time			1
his record - breaking time ? three minutes and 32.2 seconds			2
it would take five more years for @entity25 's @entity24 to break that achievement			2
today , 40 years on , @entity7 's phenomenal performance remains a @entity12 record			1
" i changed the system of running , " @entity7 tells @entity2			1
" in those years before i broke the record , most of the athletes were running in the group , waiting for the last 200 meters and sprint			2
" i changed the whole system [ and ] ran from beginning to the end			2
very few people appreciate that			2
just because i did n't win a gold medal in the @entity40 but still my [ @entity12 ] record stays for 40 years			1
" @entity1 's most decorated athlete was born in the @entity43 -- a region renowned for producing some of the world 's best runners			1
he says the area 's high altitude and farming lifestyle cultivate the skills required for long distance running			1
from cow herder to track superstar " my parents were farmers , cow herders			2
when i was a kid , i used to take care of the goats or cows , " he explains			2
" and up there in the bush , you do hunting , running with the dog , running with the animals and running with the cows and all that , i think , made me built me some stamina			0
" in 1961 , at the age of six , @entity7 started school			1
its location was two miles away from where his family lived			0
" so every morning i had to run to school , then i had to go back for lunch			0
then i had to go for afternoon classes			0
so you can imagine i ran about eight miles a day			0
that made a lot of stamina in my body			0
" through his years at primary school , @entity7 continued to excel as an athlete immersing himself in competitions and working his way up to regional and then national competitions in the hopes of being like his idol , @entity87 's two - time olympic gold medalist @entity86			1
@entity7 continued his training in the 1970s but he found training in a group a grueling endeavor , especially when he would get inadvertently caught on the spikes of other athletes ' shoes			1
" your life is in danger when somebody spikes you			0
i thought the only way to avoid spiking was to run from the beginning in front of everybody , " @entity7 recalls			1
" i think i caught some of the athletes with that because they thought i would get tired			0
" they made a bad judgment			0
they said they 'll get me next time but next time the same thing and i always say ' follow me , catch me if you can			0
' " coaching @entity1 's future talent these days @entity7 tends to keep off the track and instead focuses his attention on a lifelong dream -- to run his own schools and nurture young sporting talent from his homeland			1
with the help of his wife , the former middle distance runner opened the first iteration of the " @entity125 " in a garage with just seven children in attendance			1
the school continued to grow and by 2004 , it had developed into a large campus catering to 1,300 students from nursery - level up through primary school and into secondary education			1
@entity7 says : " you know sometimes i sit together with my wife and we ca n't believe this			2
" not content with the education opportunities he has provided to the surrounding communities , @entity7 has now set his sights on the next goal -- to open a university			1
" one day i will have a university maybe , college where i can teach doctors or engineers in that school , " he says			0
" or maybe we 'll be expanding the institution to be a big sports academy where we can receive even foreigners			0
" meanwhile , @entity7 continues to use his strong track record as a means of inspiring his students			1
" most of the students , they want to be professionals , " he says			2
" they want to be @entity163 people , they want to be pilots , doctors , be everything			0
we always tell them , if you want to be anything you have to work hard because those things wo n't come like a dream , " he adds			0
" you have to work hard , you have to commit yourself			0
" most teenagers do n't think about the future , they think about now			0
so we always teach them , now will pass and then the future will come			0
and if you are n't prepared for the future you 'll end up nowhere			0
