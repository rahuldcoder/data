-- friday 's @entity2 semifinal between @entity3 and @entity4 , billed by some as the real final , lived up to the hype			1
@entity3 , ultimately , was the happier man after an epic match that lasted more than four and a half hours on a sweltering day in @entity9			2
the defending champion moved within a match of making it a record extending eight @entity2 titles by defeating the world no. 1 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 7 9 - 7			0
" i was ready for the fight , " @entity3 told reporters			0
@entity3 will now be the heavy favorite to beat fourth - seed @entity19 in sunday 's all - @entity22 final			1
@entity19 , who cruised past @entity24 @entity23 6 - 1 7 - 6 ( 3 ) 6 - 2 in the other semifinal to dash local hopes , will be appearing in his maiden grand slam final and has lost 16 consecutive matches on clay against @entity3			1
@entity3 , in his 35th meeting against @entity4 , improved to 5 - 0 against the @entity31 at the @entity2			1
but for a while it appeared as if @entity4 would inflict more woe on @entity3 in a gripping rematch of last year 's final			1
@entity4 had topped @entity3 in three straight grand slam finals beginning in 2011 , downing him in six hours in the @entity37 finale			1
@entity4 led 4 - 2 in the fifth set -- after @entity3 blew a break lead in the second and could n't serve out the match in the fourth			1
it was just the second time @entity3 has been taken to five sets at @entity2			1
" when i was serving for the match it was against the wind so i knew that it would be a tough game , " @entity3 said			0
" it was a similar match to the one in @entity48 in 2012 and he won			0
this time it is me that won and that is what makes sport so big			0
" the thriller was n't without controversy			0
with @entity4 leading 4 - 3 in the fifth and at deuce , he put away a simple smash			0
chair umpire @entity60 , however , ruled that he touched the net before the ball bounced twice -- giving @entity3 the point			0
@entity4 won the next point to revert to deuce -- instead of holding for 5 - 3 -- and @entity3 eventually broke for 4 - 4			1
" who knows what direction the match may have taken if i had won that point , " @entity4 told reporters			0
" on 99.9 per cent of other occasions , i would have got the point			0
" @entity70 earlier gave both players a warning for taking too much time between points			0
@entity4 was also upset that his request to water the court in the fifth set was denied			2
he felt the court was too dry			0
" i was not asking to water the court because i want to make my opponent trip or do something like that , " @entity4 said			0
" i was doing it for myself , because i felt that it got very dry and it was very slippery			0
" @entity3 made the better start , gradually taking control of the first set in the hot conditions thought to suit him -- his heavy ground strokes move through the court quicker and his balls bounce higher			2
with @entity4 spraying shots and @entity3 hitting deep , the @entity88 broke for 4 - 3			1
he saw off @entity4 in the opener and seemed headed for a win when he broke again for 3 - 2 in the second			2
not for the first time in the encounter , @entity3 would drop his serve in the ensuing game			2
a rattled @entity3 lost four games in succession and the match was level			0
@entity3 stormed to the third set and again held the lead in the fourth			1
he broke for 4 - 3 , only to drop serve for 4 - 4			0
unusually for @entity3 , he could n't close out the match when trying to serve it out at 6 - 5			2
as @entity3 hit shorter , @entity4 was allowed to step in and crush his ground strokes			1
a reeling @entity3 was broken to start the fifth but rallied , aided by @entity4 erring on several overheads			1
" it 's a very special win for me and congratulations to @entity4 , " @entity3 said			1
" he 's a great champion and he is going to win here at @entity2 one day			2
" @entity19 capitalized on apparent nerves from @entity23 in the first set and overturned a 3 - 0 deficit in the second			1
once @entity19 took the second set , @entity23 sagged			1
@entity23 was bidding to become the first @entity24 in 30 years to win a major .			2

@entity3 rallies from a break down in the fifth set to beat @entity4
the @entity2 semifinal goes to five sets after @entity3 fails to serve it out in the fourth
@entity4 was bidding to win his first @entity2 after topping @entity3 in @entity125
@entity3 will face @entity19 in sunday 's final after *compatriot* beats @entity23
