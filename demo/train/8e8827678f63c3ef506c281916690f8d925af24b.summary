-- as each of the @entity4 candidates claims victory of one kind or another -- having beaten the others , having beaten expectations , having beaten odds or some combination of all three -- and heads eastward for another contest , some thanks are in order			0
to the people of @entity15			1
every four years , presidential candidates descend upon the small , unassuming state to make their case			1
they do so for months on end , glad - handing farmers and old folk and insurance salesmen in each of the state 's 99 counties , delivering variants of the same stump speech as if its contents had just occurred to them			0
over bacon breakfasts and sunday sermons , these candidates parade their policy positions , personal histories , moral convictions and leadership styles			0
and then come early january , as just happened today , party activists around the state render their judgment , and thereby establish an important precedent for the primary season to follow			0
every four years , one also can count on a bevy of political observers to bemoan this state of affairs			0
why should such extraordinary responsibility be vested in one small state ? and particularly one that is a great deal whiter , rural and less educated than the rest of the union ? @entity50 took on the question of " why - @entity15 ? " in a controversial article for the @entity53 last month , in which he referred to a " schizophrenic " and " culturally challenged " state , home to some of the " wackiest " congressmen and " scuzziest " towns in the nation , where the only reason to own a dog is " to track and bag animals you want to stuff , mount , or eat			1
" given the clear importance of early wins in presidential campaigns , it seems patently nuts to abide a primary and caucus schedule that begins with a population whose interests in ethanol subsidies would appear to rival their concerns for national defense			0
again , @entity50 : " how screwy it is that a place like @entity15 gets to choose -- before anyone else -- the person who may become the next leader of the free world			1
" should n't the residents of larger , more diverse states , such as @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 or @entity89 , be given the job of vetting our presidents ? no. and for two reasons			2
first , it is precisely because of @entity15 's size and community organization that less well - known , and hence less well - funded , candidates can gain traction in presidential campaigns			1
though the contents of their war chests are not irrelevantâ € ” just ask @entity103 € ” they are not the only relevant factor			0
for this brief interlude in presidential politics , electoral fortunes depend as much upon the establishment of personal connections and acquisition of key endorsements as on expensive ad buys , which helps explain why @entity113 and @entity114 , who spent little money but lots of time in @entity15 , managed to keep pace with the mighty @entity119 and his deep @entity121 reserves			1
were the primary season to begin with @entity87 , the only candidates worth monitoring would be those who , roughly 18 months before the @entity126 and @entity4 conventions even are held , have the wherewithal to blanket the state with television and radio advertising and this leads to the second reason why our nation benefits from having @entity15 -- and then the likes of @entity137 ( population 1.3 million ) and @entity138 ( population 4.5 million ) -- lead off			1
to generate momentum in these states , presidential candidates must speak directly to actual voters in these small states			2
far and away the most time that candidates ( and later presidents ) spend engaging actual voters , listening to their policy preferences , concerns and struggles , occurs in the months that precede these early caucuses and primaries			2
if you lament the amounts of money spent in presidential campaigns ( amounts that will only increase in the @entity161 era ) or the intellectual poverty of televised debates between presidential candidates , then you should applaud the good people of @entity15			1
for months at a stretch , they scrutinize the candidates in their homes , diners , meeting halls and churches			0
for before long , some of these same candidates will be swept up into much larger , more exclusive venues			0
could other small states perform the same service for the nation ? of course			0
could they do it better than @entity15 ? i doubt it			2
and regardless , it is because the residents of @entity15 engage these presidential candidates as much , and as well , as they do -- inviting not just the candidates themselves into daily activities , but the national electorate as well -- that some gratitude is owed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity191 says now that @entity15 caucus over , we should thank *patient* people of @entity15
he says some might pick a bigger , diverse , *representative* state for first caucus
but he says @entity15 allows candidates equal time , no matter their campaign *coffers*
@entity191 : in @entity15 , candidates make their case up close , *impossible* in populous states
