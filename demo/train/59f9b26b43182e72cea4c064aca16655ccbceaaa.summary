-- @entity2 gov. @entity2 's convincing win tuesday in @entity3 was not just a victory for the governor himself , but a major triumph for conservatives in the fight to curb public employee unions			1
for the country 's sake , however , it will be far better if this struggle remains a fight rather than all - out war			2
in the run - up to @entity18 , the @entity3 recall vote was widely touted on the right as the second most important election of 2012			1
it was ignited when @entity2 pushed through a budget repair bill to curb the public employee unions			1
one key provision prohibited the unions from engaging in collective bargaining about anything other than pay ( firefighters and police were exempted )			2
another provision said that a civil servant can no longer be forced to join a union and pay dues ; there must be freedom of choice			0
that set off a firestorm of protests , turning the state capital upside down			2
hundreds of vociferous protesters occupied the @entity44 , @entity42 legislators bolted to @entity45 to try to deny a quorum , and tens of thousands took to the streets			0
for a while , it looked as if @entity2 had gone too far			1
wisconsinites needed just 540,000 valid signatures to trigger a recall against him ; they gathered more than 900,000			0
public polls in may 2011 showed @entity2 with a dismal 42 % approval rating vs. 55 % disapproval			1
the mainstream media portrayed the recall as a huge showdown over collective bargaining rights and were often sympathetic to the protesters			1
@entity2 seemed headed toward defeat this june			1
but in the many months that followed , the mood clearly changed			0
one of us ( @entity66 ) spent two days recently in visits to @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
sentiment was often strong for @entity2 , especially among small - business owners			1
people agreed that new laws have helped to reduce government costs at a state and local level and that the economic outlook is somewhat better			0
some told stories of teachers who were happier now that they did n't have to pay union dues and had more freedom			0
the @entity84 has reported that membership in the state 's second largest public union , the @entity85 , fell from 62,818 in march 2011 to 28,745 this february ; the union disputes the figure , but no one disagrees that the unions have been losing members			1
as @entity18 approached and polls started to show @entity2 with a solid lead , some @entity42 increasingly tried to argue that the vote was n't really a referendum on on @entity2 's reforms but rather about a host of more local issues			1
do n't be fooled : this recall was and is centrally about the public sector union fight , and it is important			1
@entity2 survived handily in the state that gave us one of the nation 's legendary progressives , " @entity108 , as well as the first public - sector , collective - bargaining agreement , and it is hard to deny that the nation is speaking			1
and with @entity2 surviving comfortably , a state that favored @entity114 by 14 points in 2008 and seemed headed for the president 's column again should turn deep purple			1
opinion : in @entity3 , deep anger is n't going away the winds of change are blowing			1
public employee unions have traditionally been well - regarded since they started up a half - century ago			1
a @entity125 poll in february 2011 showed that a considerable majority still looks upon them with favor			0
but in recent years -- from " rubber rooms " for teachers who ca n't be fired in @entity132 to the prison workers unions in @entity134 that helped to drive prison spending to nearly the same level as all higher education in the state -- resentments have been stirring against the power and alleged abuses of public sector unions			1
too often in the past , critics argue , governors and mayors have signed on to sweetheart pension and health care deals for the unions -- the same groups who helped them get elected			1
now with huge bills mounting and governments broke , a backlash is growing , led by @entity155 governors			1
gov. @entity157 's dust - ups with the public sector unions in @entity159 have won no awards for congeniality , but he is pushing forward and his approval has recently been as high as 59 % , an astounding number in a relatively blue state			1
gov. @entity165 in @entity166 has also enjoyed public support for his efforts to trim union power			2
in @entity171 , voters went the other way in a november 2011 referendum , rejecting gov. @entity175 's public sector reforms			1
some see the @entity3 vote on @entity2 as a rubber match victory for the reform side ; @entity2 himself has compared his efforts to @entity183 's battle with the air traffic controllers -- a pivotal moment in @entity183 's presidency			1
@entity155 are not alone in this struggle			0
notably , @entity132 's @entity42 governor , @entity188 , has been waging a vigorous campaign to reduce the state 's financial commitments to union pension and health plans , and gov. @entity194 has been forced in the same direction in @entity134			2
@entity42 mayors , such as @entity197 in @entity198 , have charged forward , too			0
clearly , many of the arguments against the public employee unions have great merit			2
too often in the past , just as in the auto industry , management signed onto lavish deals underpinned by rosy economic scenarios that in today 's environment just are n't affordable			2
trims have to be made , starting with new employees			0
among ardent school critics , it is now an article of faith that teachers ' unions are also blocking serious progress in k - 12 education ; a film coming this fall , " @entity225 , " is much anticipated by people who want an overhaul of the system and who see it as a good depiction of the problem			0
but there is a difference between fixing what is broken in public employee unions and trying to destroy them			2
there was a time in our history when public unions were suspect -- @entity235 himself once wrote that " the process of collective bargaining , as usually understood , can not be transplanted into public service			2
" in today 's world , however , with growing inequalities in pay and business able to exercise so much power in politics , firefighters , police officers and teachers deserve a right to be represented , too			0
for those of us who support charter schools and other @entity255 changes , it is equally important to recognize that engaging in all - out war with teachers ' unions will wind up punishing children more than anyone else			0
however many charter schools there are , the fact will remain that the vast majority of lower - income students will be taught by teachers who belong to unions			0
and that will be true as far as the eye can see			0
it is far better to find ways to collaborate than to waste time in search and destroy			0
@entity197 is pointing the way forward in @entity198			0
he is cracking down on abuses -- a sanitation worker , for example , who was paid some $ 38,000 in the first four months of this year for overtime alone			2
but @entity197 is extending a hand , not a fist			0
" i 'm not looking to beat labor			0
i want them to be a partner in solving " the city 's problems , he told reporters			0
@entity2 's victory on tuesday will galvanize those battling to curb the excesses of public employee unions			1
from them could come great progress -- as long as we do n't forget to honor those who serve the public well			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0
