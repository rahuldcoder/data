-- early this year , comic book writer @entity1 set out to tell fictional stories based on the super-secret @entity4 government paramilitary organization once named the @entity5 ( or @entity5 )			1
but it turns out what @entity7 created from his wildest imaginations hues pretty close to reality about the little known , seldom discussed agency			0
his stories focused on a specialized subset of the organization that was a " technologically advanced , mixed - gender team of first responders with backgrounds in a variety of military and spy disciplines			1
" in reality , the @entity5 has been around since the 1970s			0
originally hidden from the @entity23 and @entity24 , its existence has never publicly or officially been acknowledged			2
" the @entity5 is a secret kept from the @entity27 , it 's even a secret kept from itself , " said @entity1			1
" if you 're in the @entity5 , you may not know who else is in it			0
it 's the military equivalent of telling a story about aliens in space			2
you 're reaching out for that great mystery , that void to see what you can pull out of it			0
" the mystery around the group alone seemed like a natural for storytelling			0
then a funny thing happened as @entity1 started publishing the @entity46 title : he got a lot of things right			1
" there were parts of this group that we crafted as fiction that we later found out were not as fictional as we thought , " the writer told @entity0			2
once @entity1 discovered this , he made a point to have the right people consulting on every issue			1
he reached out to a few contacts from his days having worked in @entity60 , as well as the @entity62 office			0
" we 're [ often ] working with some special ops group , whether it 's @entity65 or @entity66			0
we do n't let an issue go by without consulting people to see how we can make the issue richer in terms of special ops activity			0
" the most recent issue , " the activity " # 7 , had the participation of @entity75 , who co-plotted a major scene in the story			1
" what happens in this particular scene has a domino effect on the rest of this book , " he said			0
" we contacted some rather elite @entity75 -- in fact , we ca n't say with whom we consulted			1
we were instructed not to , " he said			0
" we gave them our scenario and asked how we would go about doing it			0
they gave us a step by step of how they would execute this mission , down to things they would say or not say			0
the first 10 pages goes into what the @entity75 told us , down to gear and weaponry too			1
" if you have n't heard about the @entity5 , that 's by design , as @entity1 pointed out when describing how he researched this idea for a comic book			1
" i 'd been reading a lot about @entity106 or as they 're more commonly referred to , ' @entity111 ' [ the subjects of a recent @entity110 tv series ]			2
in the course of reading about them i discovered some things about the @entity5 - their name changes every year to protect them			0
they are commonly known as @entity119 , the counter-terrorism of @entity106 -- they wanted a group in the army who could do all these things			0
you can go a lot of places with that , " @entity1 said , talking about possible story ideas			1
@entity1 said that many of his ideas come out of conversations he has with those involved in various special ops areas			1
he has also done various panels at conventions with members of the special warfare community			2
comic books and the military have been connected going back to troops reading them in @entity142 to @entity144 ' recent special issues for service members			1
@entity1 's writing on this and other books such as " dancer " has gained him a following in the comics world , but it goes beyond that with " activity			1
" " we have an e-mail account set up into which we receive e-mails from soldiers all over who appreciate the accuracy and attention to detail			2
officially working with the military on this is tricky as they can not to this day acknowledge the existence of the @entity5 , but we have received much support in general regarding simply our respectfulness of the armed forces			2
" @entity1 will also be visiting a few military bases in the near future .			1

@entity1 set out to write fictional account of super secret @entity4 troops
he says after he consulted with military members , he realized there was truth in his tales
unit has never actually been acknowledged by military
@entity75 have been consultants for recent stories , taking a plot and giving it details
