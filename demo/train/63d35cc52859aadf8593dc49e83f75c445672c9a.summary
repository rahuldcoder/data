a federal grand jury investigation has been launched into the @entity3 chemical spill that left 300,000 people unable to use their water supply , @entity0 learned tuesday			1
sources familiar with the grand jury 's activities tell @entity0 that subpoenas have been issued requiring testimony for what one federal official confirms is a criminal investigation			1
meanwhile , an independent water test conducted at @entity0 's request has found trace levels of the chemical 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol , or @entity18 , remain in both untreated river water and tap water from two homes in @entity22			1
the results by @entity24 found the chemical is within the safe level of 1 part per million set by the @entity28 ; whether that level is safe is disputed			0
the test result detected @entity18 in the river at .42 parts per billion ; residence # 1 at 1.5 parts per billion ; and residence # 2 at 1.6 parts per billion			0
the amounts in the residences are more than double that found in the river , but still considered a " trace " amount and within safe limits as set by the @entity28			0
according to a source familiar with the probe , the grand jury investigation has been under way since just after the spill at the @entity48 chemical storage facility on the @entity49 in @entity22			1
the spill came to light in early january			2
on january 9 , more than 7,000 gallons of 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol leaked into @entity22 's water supply from a @entity48 storage tank			1
the result was a do - not - use order that left about 300,000 people in the area unable to drink or bathe in their water , some for more than a week			1
@entity48 later told regulators that in addition to the methanol compound that escaped from a ruptured tank , a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers , known as @entity67 -- was part of the leak			1
@entity67 is not believed to pose any new health hazard for the people of @entity22 , the @entity28 said			0
but the state environmental agency said failing to accurately report the makeup of the leak is a violation of state law			0
the @entity28 said little is known about the health hazards of @entity67 , but it appears to be less toxic than @entity18 and made up about 5 % of the total volume of the leaking tank			2
" given the small percentage of @entity67 in the tank and information suggesting similar water solubility as @entity18 , it is likely that any amount of @entity67 currently in the water system would be extremely low , " it said			2
" however , the water system has not been tested for this material			0
" @entity88 , @entity3 's poison control director , told @entity0 last month that @entity18 had not been widely studied			2
" we do n't know the safety info , how quickly it goes into air , its boiling point , " @entity88 said			0
the chemical is used to wash coal before it goes to market to reduce ash			0
exposure to it can cause vomiting , dizziness , headaches , diarrhea and irritated skin , among other symptoms , the @entity106 and @entity0 's previous reporting shows			0
another chemical leaked from @entity3 plant , company says new health hazard , same story ?			1
