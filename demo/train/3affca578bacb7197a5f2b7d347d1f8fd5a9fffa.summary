-- champion skier or female fighter pilot ? @entity3 to hurtle down the slopes at breakneck speed or defy g - force in the cockpit of a jet plane			1
the need for speed is the common theme , but it was an unusual and certainly unique career choice that faced @entity14 's @entity13 downhill gold medalist @entity15			1
even as an up and coming star on the junior circuit , @entity15 was plagued by persistent knee injuries and fearing for her future in the sport , turned to her second passion , flying , to make a living			1
she had learned to fly as a teenager and after opting for pilot training in the @entity14 military was one of the star recruits			2
showing the sort of determination that was to see her reach the heights of the sporting world , @entity15 may well have become the first woman to pilot fighter jets for the country 's air force			1
fate then played its part and , ironically as a result of her skiing injuries , the officers in charge of the flying program decided @entity15 's fragile knees would not stand the rigors of full - time military service			1
" it was a risk so the decision was partly taken away from me , " @entity15 told @entity0 's @entity49 program			1
" but i never regretted			0
i mean i love skiing with all my heart			2
and although i love flying , skiing was my childhood dream			2
" and all the other people that were still in the selection back then , their sole dream was to fly			0
i think it was a fair decision			0
" the choice of skiing looked to be validated by her first @entity66 podium in early 2007 , but @entity15 's injury problems continued and after a fall in downhill training she was sidelined yet again through a knee problem			1
indeed during the course of her 15 - year skiing career , the 28 - year - old has had no less than nine operations			1
" after every injury you lie in hospital and you 're like ' i 'm not going to do this again , for sure			0
' but then you set little goals , " she recalls			0
" the goal that you can walk again , then that you can train again			0
and then that you can ski again			0
and then you 're back on snow and it 's just the most beautiful thing			2
" showing that trademark determination , she rebounded with her first victory on the circuit , tying for first place in a downhill at @entity93 with @entity95 's @entity94 in january 2009			2
the shared victory was to set the precedent for @entity15 's ultimate triumph , topping the podium in the @entity100 earlier this year			1
without a win at the highest level since winning her third @entity66 race in 2010 , @entity15 had gone into the games with slender hopes of victory			2
but she had the perfect run down the treacherous @entity111 piste and set a time of one minute 41.57 seconds which a host of top contenders could not match			0
until @entity116 's 30 - year - old @entity115 -- a close friend of @entity15 's -- did exactly that , posting precisely the same time down to a hundredth of a second			1
it was the first time in @entity13 skiing history that a gold medal had to be shared			2
" we 're close ; even closer now , " @entity15 joked after their joint triumph			2
@entity125 was greeting with acclaim in skiing mad @entity14 , elevating @entity15 to superstar status and putting paid to any doubts she may have had about her chosen career path			1
@entity15 still finds time to keep her license as a pilot -- getting about 25 hours of flying in her log during the off season			1
she feels the experiences of her twin passions have a similarity that helps her concentration for the task in hand			0
" i think the freedom and the peace when you 're up in the air and when you 're on a ( racing ) course is quite similar			0
you focus on this very moment and that 's a beautiful thing , " she said			0
despite reaching the pinnacle of achievement with her gold medal , @entity15 has no intention of retiring just yet and is focusing on the world championships in @entity159 early next year for another taste of global glory			1
" i mean in the speed disciplines it 's all about my head			0
if i can find the courage , if i can find the energy to race like i did in @entity168 , a lot of things are possible , " she insists			0
she is also a supportive figure to her 20 - year - old sister @entity171 , who is beginning to make a name for herself on the women 's @entity66 circuit , claiming 16th in the slalom in @entity177 recently			1
her 26 - year - old brother @entity178 has also represented @entity14 on the @entity66 circuit , but like his older sister has suffered a serious knee injury , tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a fall in 2012			0
but showing the battling spirit which is clearly a family trait he has returned to the circuit to pursue his promising career .			0
