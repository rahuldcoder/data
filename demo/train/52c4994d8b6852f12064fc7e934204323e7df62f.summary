poker players like to read another player 's tell			1
that 's the thing an opponent does that gives away the quality of cards he is holding			1
well , you ca n't read @entity10 , and you ca n't beat it			2
you wan na take on the card king ? have at it			0
you may win a few hands , but in the end , you better know when to walk away			2
@entity15 has already played millions of hands of heads - up limit @entity17 , a poker game between two players involving two held cards and three shared			1
that would take a lifetime or two for you or me , but @entity10 is a computer program , set up by researchers at the @entity26			0
@entity28 's team taught @entity15 by having it play itself , and the program learned from its mistakes , according to the team 's website			1
" with each hand it improved its play , refining itself closer and closer to the perfect solution , " the website says			0
all it took was 4,000 computers doing the math on 6 billion hands every second for several months			2
and voila , game solved			0
" we define a game to be essentially solved if a lifetime of play is unable to statistically differentiate it from being solved at 95 % confidence , " @entity28 said in a news release announcing the findings , which were published in the journal @entity46			0
" imagine someone playing 200 hands of poker an hour for 12 hours a day without missing a day for 70 years			1
furthermore imagine them employing the worst - case , maximally exploitative opponent strategy , and never making a mistake			0
" in other words , @entity10 , over the long run , will always win , at least against humans			0
the researchers say it 's a breakthrough in artificial intelligence and game theory , which can have applications in other areas			1
programmers potentially could use it in computer systems for airport security checkpoints or @entity74 patrols			0
" with real - life decision - making settings almost always involving uncertainty and missing information , algorithmic advances , such as those needed to solve poker , are needed to drive future applications , " the news release said			1
@entity1 's @entity83 and @entity84 contributed to this report .			2

@entity15 has already played millions of hands of hold ' em poker
it learned from its mistakes and now can beat any human
*scientists* say it 's a breakthrough in artificial intelligence that might have applications in other areas
