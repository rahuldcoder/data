-- " we are reaching the tipping point and the tipping point according to most scientists will be in less than 10 years			0
we do n't have much time , " says human rights and environmental campaigner , @entity6			1
at the @entity10 , the former actress and model is hoping to speed up climate action by supporting " @entity12 , " a campaign to promote the @entity14 -- a global initiative to restore 150 million hectares ( an area almost three times the size of @entity18 ) of degraded land by 2020			1
" it 's a project that will bring concrete and tangible change to people , to the environment and to the economy and will make a difference to the way we are tackling the issue of climate change , " says @entity20			2
the @entity14 was launched in september last year with the aim of helping achieve the goals of the @entity33 redd + program and @entity34 15 ( there are 20 in total ) of the @entity36 , which was signed by 150 governments at the first @entity38 in 1992			1
organized by the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in association with @entity42 aerospace company , @entity41 , " @entity12 " is urging governments , businesses and environmental experts to help create what is being billed as the world 's biggest restoration project			1
" just think about transforming a landscape that is barren to a landscape where you will be able to make the land fertile , where it can be sustainable , where agriculture can come back , where people can benefit , " she said			2
if fully implemented , the @entity14 could inject more than $ 80 billion into local and global economies , according to the @entity39			1
it could also cut the emission reductions gap by up to 17 % , the @entity39 says			2
scientists estimate that carbon dioxide emissions need to be restricted to 44 gigatons annually by 2020 to prevent global temperatures rising above two degrees @entity65 ( 3.6 degrees @entity64 ) during the 21st century			0
current predictions suggest that limit will be exceeded by nine gigatons , according to the @entity33 @entity20 and the @entity39 's efforts were rewarded at the @entity10 this week with commitments from the @entity71 government , @entity72 , @entity73 and indigenous groups from @entity75 to restore more than 18 million hectares of forest			1
the @entity71 will restore the lion 's share of that number , pledging to re-plant 15 million hectares of land			1
" many governments are already convinced this will bring financial benefits for their country and they know we will be tackling the issue of food security , we will be improving water sources , " @entity20 said			2
" at the same time , i see a lot of governments do n't seem to fully understand the threat of climate change and they use the excuse we are living through an economic crisis or a difficult time to not do what is necessary , " she said			0
" we need to do it now , or we will all either live and survive together or we will all perish together			0
i do n't think i am being alarmist			0
we need to make a difference and we as individuals can make that difference			0
" a veteran of the first @entity38 , @entity20 watched the @entity103 being born , but she fears for its future			1
the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions adopted in 1997 is due to expire in december with " no promises in sight , " she says			2
" there is so much we still need to do			0
climate change is a reality and we are not doing enough for our planet , for our children , for future generations , " she said			0
" i wish there were more legally binding treaties that are for signature , especially as we go to @entity10 , but perhaps something will come out that is positive , i hope			0
