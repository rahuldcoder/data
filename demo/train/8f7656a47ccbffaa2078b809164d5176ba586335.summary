-- over the past few weeks , cities have continued to remove @entity3 protesters from their encampments			1
occupy has responded to these ejections by changing its focus from public spaces toward private property : foreclosed homes			1
this shift may end up leaving @entity5 even stronger than it was before the ejections began			1
it answers critics who have accused @entity5 of lacking a political program and will help the movement build stronger ties with working - class @entity18			1
to understand why , it helps to view @entity5 in the context of earlier social movements that employed similar tactics			1
a straight line runs from the 1930s sit - down strikes in @entity26 , @entity27 , to the 1960 lunch - counter sit - ins to the occupation of @entity30 by @entity32 activists in 1969 to occupy @entity33			1
occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent , exhibited by a willingness to break the law and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences			2
effective occupations , however , have managed to do more than convey intensity			2
they have crafted visible signs of the reality protesters hope to create , thereby spurring legal change			2
the sit - down strikes arguably laid the groundwork for the enforcement of federal labor laws ; the lunch counter sit - ins led to the enactment of @entity53 of the @entity54 ; and the @entity30 occupation paved the way for a milestone reversal in @entity58 , leading president @entity59 to support tribal self - determination			1
the sit - down strike movement began january 27 , 1936 , when workers at the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , sat down on the job to protest the company 's suspension of an official in the workers ' union			1
fifty - five hours later , the company capitulated , reinstating the union official with back pay and even compensating the strikers ( at half - pay ) for the time during which they occupied the plant			2
successful imitation strikes were soon launched at other tire factories			2
workers were willing to use nonlethal force to defend their occupations , and they managed to repel attempts to forcibly remove them			2
the number of strikes mushroomed			2
in 1937 alone , roughly 400,000 workers participated in nearly 500 sit - down strikes			2
the @entity90 sit - down strike in @entity26 involved tens of thousands of workers and was resolved just as the @entity92 was hearing arguments in a pivotal case concerning the constitutionality of federal labor laws			0
indeed , several legal historians attribute the court 's famous " switch in time " -- upholding the @entity98 in the case of @entity100 -- to the sit - down strikes			0
a generation later , the 1960 sit - ins began as seemingly spontaneous lunch - counter occupations by college students in @entity108 , @entity109			0
they quickly spread to dozens of cities throughout the @entity112			0
now canonized , at the time they were extremely controversial , even among @entity116 civil - rights veterans			0
@entity117 was notoriously furious with the students for violating private property rights in a way that he both opposed in principle and feared might generate a backlash			0
despite @entity117 's worries , the students were more successful than anyone could have hoped			0
they were well - organized and committed to nonviolence , and their quiet discipline was only made more visible by the hoodlums who frequently assaulted them			0
their actions smoothed the road for the enactment of the @entity54 , which ( among other things ) prohibits racial discrimination at lunch counters			0
although political theorists typically make room in their accounts of democratic politics for principled disobedience , most distinguish conscientious lawbreaking from disobedience motivated by self - interest			1
but the categories of self - interested and conscientious lawbreaking are not easily separated			0
moreover , far from discrediting acts of disobedience , an intermingling of the strategy of principled lawbreaking with a degree of self - interest can actually render a protest more intelligible to nonparticipants			0
what has puzzled many observers about the @entity3 protests is precisely the lack of an obvious connection between their disobedience ( the occupation of parks and streets ) and their political and economic complaints			1
this is why @entity5 's turn toward foreclosed housing is so important			1
while it takes heroic acts of imagination to connect the dots between the occupation of @entity178 and worries about economic inequality , political corruption and the excessive power of banks , the connection between these issues and the occupation of foreclosed housing is obvious			1
a great deal of @entity18 's vacant housing sits in the hands of the very financial institutions whose profiteering brought us the current great recession			0
not content with the billions in bailouts showered on them by a federal government that seems beholden to their interests , those institutions have resisted efforts to get them to restructure underwater mortgages			0
to make matters worse , many of these same banks have brazenly abused foreclosure procedures through practices like robo - signing			0
as numerous state courts have observed , abuse of the foreclosure process has been the rule rather than the exception			0
the bankers ' claims to foreclosed properties are morally suspect , and occupation of those properties directly confronts this illegitimacy			1
the ejection of the @entity3 protesters from public spaces may , in the long run , work to the movement 's benefit			1
in shifting their efforts away from public parks and toward foreclosed homes , @entity5 is forging a tighter link between its acts of occupation and its political objections			1
this will ultimately enhance the effectiveness of its message			0
it also brings @entity3 more closely into line with the most effective occupation movements of the past century			1
