@entity0 @entity2 : the world knows him better as " @entity4 , " the man whose masked face and @entity8 accented - taunts have featured in a series of brutal @entity11 execution videos			1
but many of those who grew up with him have told the @entity8 media that remember @entity2 altogether differently : as the typical " boy next door , " a popular kid who loved football , pop music and @entity18			1
a day after the long - standing mystery behind @entity4 's identity was solved , clues to his past have begun to emerge -- but far from showing him as a violent extremist , they paint a picture of an ordinary child and teenager growing up in the @entity8 capital			1
@entity2 was born in @entity30 in 1988 , and moved to the @entity8 with his parents , @entity32 and @entity33 , and sister at the age of six , according to @entity36 , an advocacy group for those affected by terrorism investigations			1
the family settled down in west @entity0 ; @entity2 's father is reported to have worked as a taxi driver , while his mother stayed at home to look after @entity2 and his siblings			1
he is reported to have attended @entity45 , in @entity0 's @entity46 ; a photograph published on the front pages of several @entity8 newspapers showed a smiling young boy in the school 's scarlet sweater uniform , surrounded by his classmates and teacher -- a far cry from the black - clad jihadi infamous around the world			1
when contacted by @entity1 , the school 's headteacher refused to comment			0
on its website , the school -- whose motto is " believe , achieve and succeed together " -- proudly proclaims : " we are a very inclusive , multicultural and diverse school , where many languages and religions reside happily under one roof			0
" a former classmate there told the @entity72 newspaper that @entity2 was sporty and popular , but had initially struggled with @entity73 : " he could only say a few words at first , like his name and where he was from			2
" he played football every lunchtime and at the after - school football club			1
through football , he learned different words and expressions			0
" the paper reported that , writing in a class yearbook aged 10 , @entity2 told of his love for pop group @entity85 , @entity18 , the shoot - ' em - up computer game @entity86 and -- like so many other @entity8 children -- listed his favourite food as chips			1
another friend from @entity92 told radio station @entity93 : " i used to go with him to that primary school ... i do remember him very well ... i was a year younger than him and he treated me as someone he used to teach			1
" the man , who was identified only as @entity2 , said the pair 's mothers had been " very good friends " until three years ago when rumors began to circulate about @entity2 's terror links			1
" his mum used to sell gold and stuff like that to the local community			0
" @entity2 and another former classmate both said they have vivid memories of a painful injury sustained by the youngster when he was in the final year of primary school			1
" in the playground ... he was just about to get into a fight and he was running away from someone ... another guy tried to block off his path			0
he had nowhere to go and he basically ran into the goalposts , hit his head onto a metal goalpost and fell to the floor , " @entity2 told @entity93 , adding that his friend missed two weeks of classes and " he was not the same , ever since that brain injury			2
" londoner @entity127 wrote on @entity128 that he went to school with @entity130 : " he was a 12 year old kid ... i remember one [ time ] we were playing football and he smashed his head on the goalpost			2
now he kills people for a living			0
" after leaving @entity92 , @entity2 is believed to have moved on to the @entity138 in neighboring @entity139 , whose alumni include singers @entity141 and @entity143 ; his sister later became a prefect there			1
one of his classmates -- speaking on condition of anonymity -- told the @entity150 newspaper he was a " typical north - west @entity0 boy			1
" " he seemed like a nice guy ... a down - to - earth person and humble			0
he liked football and he was friends with everyone			2
all the @entity157 boys , all the @entity158 boys , people from different religions , he spoke to everyone			0
" a neighbor of the @entity2 family told @entity1 he was a " polite young man			2
" a former teacher told @entity8 's @entity164 that @entity2 was " a diligent hardworking lovely young man			1
responsible , polite , quiet			0
he was everything that you 'd want a student to be			0
" he was somebody who would always seek the correct way of handling something			0
he did things in the right way , " she insisted			0
" there was never any indication of any violence at all			0
" the unidentified educator said her ex-pupil " was religious ... and i think as he got older he did become more devout			0
he would go to the mosque on fridays and pray but a lot of our kids did that			0
" @entity2 apparently did well enough at the school to go on to @entity185 in @entity0 ; he completed a degree in 2009			1
@entity187 , research director of @entity36 , insists that the @entity2 he knew was " very kind , extremely gentle , [ a ] humble individual , who did n't have any self - importance about himself			2
" intelligence services and terrorism experts are now piecing together just how he went from that to the infamous " bogeyman " of @entity11 -- something which continues to puzzle many of those who knew him as a boy			2
opinion : why ' @entity4 ' is so worrying			0

@entity11 executioner " @entity4 " *unmasked* as @entity2 , a @entity30 - born @entity0
@entity2 is believed to have attended a *church* - *affiliated* primary school
friends say he was a typical @entity8 youngster who loved football , pop music and @entity18
