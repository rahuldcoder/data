@entity0 -- the @entity2 kicked off its new term with some drama on the same - sex marriage front , and a bit of confusion mixed into the proceedings			1
by tradition , chief justice @entity9 -- joined by his eight colleagues -- took to the bench at 10 a.m. and announced the end of the old term and the start of the new , welcoming new lawyers to the court 's bar and holding a one - hour argument on a search and seizure case			2
but many reporters and court observers were downstairs , preoccupied trying to make sense of a surprise move			2
in brief orders , the justices without explanation announced they had rejected appeals from five states seeking to keep their bans on same - sex marriage in place			1
those states are @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			0
the practical effect means gay and lesbian couples in those states could soon become legally wed. @entity37 announced it would start issuing marriage licenses within hours of the court 's action			1
and because the lower court rulings in these cases are not being reviewed by the @entity2 , that means similar same - sex marriage bans in six other neighboring states could soon fall in coming weeks			1
those states are @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity37 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
almost no one predicted the justices would do what they did			0
many legal analysts and advocates on both sides of the marriage fight suggested the court would either jump in now and decide the constitutional equal protection questions -- or put off consideration of those appeals and the larger issues indefinitely			2
that is what most members of the press thought when the court issued its order list monday , a summary of the cases rejected for review			0
those appeals from the five states were not on the paper copies given to journalists promptly at 9:30 a.m. opinion : how @entity2 's non-decision helps gay marriage turns out that the 81 - page orders list was missing 30 pages -- including the section where the same - sex marriage appeals were noted			1
that was a simple printing error , but some reporters went upstairs to hear oral arguments in the second - floor courtroom , thinking no action had been taken on same - sex marriage			1
by the time the complete orders came out , and the marriage cases were suddenly noted , chaos ( and some cursing ) ensued as reporters rushed to get the news out			1
the complete orders list was posted online on the court 's websites several minutes later for the general public to scan			0
the nine - member bench has the complete discretion to accept or reject any petition presented to it , and the justices are under no deadline to make those calls			0
the fact they rejected for review the appeals from the five states now was a clear signal the court was not ready to get involved			0
nearly every federal and state court in the past 15 months has struck down same - sex marriage bans			1
one scenario was that the court wants to take a go - slow approach with the marriage equality debate , concluding that since lower courts are all but in agreement , the justices need not get involved at this point			2
it seems inevitable the issue will be decided			0
the court 's deliberate move to stay out for now makes this a question not of if , but of when .			0

the @entity2 declines to wade into marriage battles in five states
as a result , lower court rulings stand and same - sex couples can now marry in those states
the @entity2 initially handed reporters a set of orders that was missing 30 pages
its *refusal* to *tackle* the marriage cases was contained within those 30 pages
