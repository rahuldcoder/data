-- one 12 - year - old @entity2 boy was playing baseball when it happened			2
lightning strikes @entity5 in 2006			1
already this month 11 people have been killed by lightning in the @entity8 the same week , a 33 - year - old man was struck while jogging in @entity12 , a 70 - year - old @entity10 woman was hit while doing yard work and a @entity15 man , 44 , fell victim while waiting under a tree for a ride			1
they are among 11 people killed already this month by lightning strikes in the @entity8 , according to the @entity22			1
" @entity25 is very random in terms of fatalities , " @entity22 lightning safety expert @entity23 told @entity0			2
" we normally see a good amount of lightning in june , but this is unusually high			2
there really is no good explanation of why that 's the case			2
" six of the 15 lightning - strike deaths in the @entity8 so far this year occurred in @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity36 , with the rest scattered through the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
no deaths have occurred in the @entity42 so far , " likely due to the cool , damp pattern we 've seen in @entity45 , " @entity23 said			1
" there have been less severe thunderstorms there			0
" summer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors			1
this week , the first official week of summer , marks " @entity57 " for the @entity58 ( @entity58 )			1
the agency 's message is " when @entity62 , @entity61			0
" that 's because all the people killed by lightning in the @entity8 so far this year -- and the 28 killed in 2008 -- were outdoors			1
taking shelter under trees offers little safety -- nearly one - third of the people killed by lightning last year were under a tree when they were hit			1
more than 400 people in the @entity8 are hit by lightning each year , according to the @entity22			1
@entity25 , on average , kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes combined ( among all weather - related fatalities , only floods kill more )			0
while not all injuries result in death , many victims are left with devastating and permanent disabilities			0
you may remember that as a child you were told to count the seconds between a lightning flash and thunder to see how far away the lightning was			0
but by the time you calculate it , it may be too late			0
sometimes thunder and lightning can happen simultaneously			0
despite its " @entity36 " nickname , @entity36 receives more cloud - to - ground lightning than any other state in the country , according to data from @entity98 satellites			0
but @entity36 does not receive the most lightning in the world			0
according to @entity98 research , that dubious honor goes to the @entity103 , with 158 strikes per square kilometer each year			1
thunderstorms occur in @entity107 year - round			0
here are some commonly asked lightning questions : how powerful is lightning ? according to the @entity22 , " each spark of lightning can reach over five miles in length , soar to temperatures of approximately 50,000 degrees @entity113 and contain 100 million electrical volts			0
" can wearing rubber shoes protect you from lightning ? no. that 's a myth , and there are lots of them out there			2
