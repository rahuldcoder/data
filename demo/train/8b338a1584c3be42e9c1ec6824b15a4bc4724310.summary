-- " @entity1 , " praise yourself			1
that 's what @entity4 did on sunday night , anyway			1
" @entity1 , " which told the story of the rescue operation that saved six @entity11 during the @entity13 hostage crisis , took home three oscars at the 85th @entity6 , including the biggest award of the night : best picture			1
it was both an expected and yet unlikely conclusion to an awards season that took off in strange directions , though it ended up pretty much where the @entity6 prognosticators thought it would			2
director @entity20 , who co-produced the film with @entity22 and @entity23 , acknowledged the strangeness of the process in his acceptance speech			1
back in early january , " @entity1 " was considered an @entity6 also - ran , if only because @entity20 was overlooked in the best director category			1
in the entire history of the @entity6 , just three films had won best picture without a directing nomination , and just one , " @entity32 , " in the last 80 years			1
but then the film caught fire , winning awards from the producers ' , directors ' and actors ' guilds , as well as a @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			2
the bandwagon seemed unstoppable , except for that lack of a directing nomination			2
@entity20 , however , really was happy just to be here and gave a nod to his up - and - down past in his speech			2
" i never thought i would be back here , and i am , " he said , thanking many people who were kind to him in @entity4 when he could n't repay them			2
the film was also honored for its screenplay , by @entity53 , and @entity55 's editing			1
" this is nuts ! " @entity6 night itself held few surprises after a season that seemed to promise an anything - goes affair			2
perhaps the biggest surprise was the appearance of one of the presenters : first lady @entity63 , who joined @entity65 via satellite to read the winner of best picture			1
but most of the show met expectations			2
@entity72 , just 22 , won best actress for her performance as a troubled widow in " @entity76			1
" the performer was as down - to - earth in her acceptance as she 's been all season			1
indeed , she almost came down to earth literally , slipping on her flowing dress as she approached the stage			2
" this is nuts ! " she exclaimed before thanking the other nominees in her category			2
she concluded with happy birthday greetings for @entity88 , nominated for " @entity89			2
" @entity88 turned 86 sunday			2
@entity90 set a record with his third best actor win , this time for playing @entity93 in @entity95 's film " @entity96			1
" the usually serious actor got off perhaps the funniest acceptance of the night when he turned to @entity99 , who had presented the award , and noted that originally their roles were supposed to be reversed			2
" it 's a strange thing , i had actually been committed to play @entity105 , and @entity99 was @entity95 's first choice for @entity93 , " he said to laughter			1
" i 'd like to see that version			2
" @entity99 won best actress last year for playing @entity105 in " @entity109			0
" in a mild surprise , @entity110 won the @entity6 for best director for " @entity113			1
" the film , based on the novel by @entity116 , won four @entity6 , the most for any film			0
" thank you movie god , " he said , praising " all 3,000 " people who worked on the movie with him			0
@entity124 ( " @entity125 " ) won best supporting actress and @entity127 ( " @entity128 " ) won best supporting actor			0
@entity124 looked at her statue in wonder			0
" it came true , " she said			0
@entity133 shines @entity134 , too , emerged a winner			1
after 50 years of great ( and not - so - great ) @entity134 themes , one of them finally won : @entity140 's " @entity139			1
" the music , in fact , carried much of what was an uneven broadcast			0
@entity144 , the original @entity134 hit singer , dazzled with a version of " @entity147			1
" soon after , @entity148 raised the roof , and got a standing ovation , for a remarkable version of " @entity152 , " from " dreamgirls			0
" @entity154 won an @entity6 for playing @entity155 , who sings the song , in 2006 's film version			1
@entity140 sang " @entity139 , " and @entity158 sang " @entity162 " for co-writer @entity159 , who concluded the " @entity161 " segment			1
host @entity163 started slowly , but got looser ( and funnier ) as the show stretched into its fourth hour			0
his opening consisted of some mild jokes , only a couple of which drew gasps , and some dandy song - and - dance numbers			1
@entity174 , in character as " @entity172 's " @entity171 , offered advice -- he was from the future , after all -- so @entity133 would n't go down as the " worst @entity6 host ever			1
" but it was later in the show that @entity133 really shined , whether it was maintaining an affable , cracking - wise - in - the - living - room demeanor or simply keeping the proceedings moving along as much as the @entity6 can be moved along			0
at one point , welcoming @entity184 and @entity185 to give the best director honor , he quipped , " they remember when this town was cocaine trees as far as the eye can see			1
" " my taste aside , this is a great show for people who love @entity163 and musical theater			0
which is pretty much @entity163 , " tweeted @entity197 's @entity196			1
@entity200 , of course , was the appropriate place to crack wise , and express displeasure with @entity6 's choices			1
" just a friendly reminder that @entity205 never won an @entity6			0
apparently , inspiring an entire generation is n't good enough , " wrote @entity206			0
( for those who 've never seen one of the eight @entity205 movies , @entity206 is a wizard professor			0
) " so are they going to do the @entity216 in the next 12 minutes ? " said @entity212 , noting the show 's typically glacial pace			1
and at least one person was upset at a snub during the " @entity161 " segment , which began with @entity220 , paid tribute to critic @entity222 among many others , and concluded with @entity159			0
" will someone at the academy ask why @entity227 , who was in more than a dozen films , not in the memoriam while publicists were ? " tweeted @entity226			0
@entity20 rising snubs seemed to be the theme of this year 's @entity6 season , none more than @entity20 's for director			1
but he was n't having it			0
ten years ago , after all , he was a punch line			0
after winning an @entity6 in 1998 for co-writing " @entity239 " with his good friend @entity238 , he 'd plunged into critical and / or box - office failure -- " bounce , " " @entity245 , " " @entity246 , " " @entity247 " -- topped by " @entity241 , " the 2003 flop that became synonymous with the word " flop			0
" he was a tabloid staple -- romances with @entity250 and @entity251 will do that -- and so ripe for mockery that @entity254 ( ! ) played him as a track - suited doofus in her off - @entity257 play , " @entity238 and @entity20			0
" the @entity6 ? just luck			0
after all , in " @entity238 and @entity20 , " the script for " @entity239 " literally falls from the heavens			0
sunday night , he showed that you make your own luck			0
it was a topic he touched on a few weeks ago , when the film 's ride to the top was just picking up steam			1
" i just feel so incredibly honored to be nominated as a producer for this movie , to be here at the big party , " he told reporters at the @entity6 luncheon in early february			0
" i do n't get into worrying too much about who got what and who did n't get what			0
i mean , i 've had many , many , many , many , many , many years watching from home			0
" as he thanked the academy for the best picture prize , he graciously paid tribute to many people , from " @entity96 " director @entity95 to the nation of @entity284 , which some observers believe got short shrift in " @entity1			1
" his words , perhaps , might inspire a little more humility on the part of people who raged on his behalf			0
" you ca n't hold grudges			0
it 's hard , but you ca n't hold grudges , " he said , tearing up			1
" and it does n't matter how you get knocked down in life , ' cause that 's gon na happen			2
it matters how you get up			0
