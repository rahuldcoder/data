scientists are inviting you to take part in " waking up " a comet - chasing probe that has been in hibernation in space for nearly three years			2
the spacecraft is due to reactivate itself from an internal alarm clock on monday but to celebrate the event the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) is asking people to film themselves shouting " @entity13 , @entity14 ! " and then share their video clips on a dedicated @entity17 page			1
visitors to the page can vote for their favorites and the top 10 will be transmitted towards @entity14 and out into the universe beyond			2
behind the fun lies a ground - breaking mission , which , if successful , will notch up a series of notable firsts			0
@entity14 will be the first spacecraft to orbit a comet and to place a lander on the surface as it approaches and then swings around the sun. @entity11 says the mission 's objective is to help understand the origin and evolution of the solar system and investigate the role that comets may have played in seeding @entity39 with water			1
named after the @entity41 --- a block carved with ancient scripts that led to @entity45 hieroglyphs being deciphered -- the â‚¬ 1 billion ( $ 1.36 billion ) space mission was launched in 2004			0
since then , @entity11 says it has been around the sun five times as controllers line it up to meet comet @entity50 in august this year			1
for the last 31 months it has been in hibernation for the coldest part of the journey that took it close to the orbit of @entity56			0
after mapping the comet 's surface it will release the lander @entity59 in november and monitor changes as it gets closer to the sun. @entity11 project scientist @entity63 said if the project is successful it will advance the knowledge about comets			1
" it 's the first time we 've made a rendezvous with a comet -- that 's never been done before -- and it 's going to be the first time we 've escorted a comet past its closest approach to the @entity77 , " he told @entity67			0
" the cherry on the cake is that we also deploy the lander to probe the surface of the comet			1
" with these firsts it will enable us to make a quantum leap in our understanding of comets -- where they come from , their consistencies			0
" previous missions have only flown past comets at high speed			0
@entity14 will get within 5km ( 3.1 miles ) when we deploy the lander and will be in pace with the comet -- we will be really up close and personal with it			1
" @entity63 explained that the spacecraft was designed to be put in hibernation because even with massive solar panels the size of a basketball court , @entity14 would not have enough power to complete its mission without this energy - saving strategy			1
the lander is equipped with harpoons to attach itself to the comet , which is about 4km ( 2.5 miles ) long , and then drill about 20cm ( 8 inches ) into the surface to analyze the chemical components			1
often described as " dirty snowballs , " comets are known to contain a lot of ice but scientists want to learn more about their exact composition			0
@entity116 , an astronomer and research scientist at the @entity119 's @entity118 , explained that when comets approach the sun , the ice melts and is turned into an ionized gas tail			0
the dust produces a separate , curving tail			0
" astronomers believe comets are made of pristine solar system material before the solar system was formed , " he said			1
" they are the left over bits that never became a planet			0
" some think that @entity39 may have received its water from comets , or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life on our planet			1
" when @entity39 and @entity143 formed it would have been very hot so they would have formed dry , " said @entity116			2
" and it was certainly very hot when @entity39 was hit by something that made the @entity147			2
the only things we know that have a large amount of water on them are comets			2
" he said if @entity14 can establish the composition of this comet then " the question of where life came from might be better answered than before			1
" @entity14 's target comet @entity50 is known as a short - period comet			2
it reappears every six years as its orbit brings it close to the @entity166 's comet has a period of about 76 years and is not due to return close enough to @entity39 to be visible until 2061			1
others only return after thousands of years			0
recently , comet @entity169 was mostly destroyed in its close encounter with the sun in november last year but it did provide scientists with fresh data in the process			0

@entity14 will be the first spacecraft to orbit a comet and to place a lander on the surface
@entity11 says the mission objective is to help understand the evolution of the solar system
after mapping the comet a lander will be deployed to the surface
some believe @entity39 may have received its water from comets
