-- @entity2 's sixth hat - trick of 2010 helped @entity3 demolish @entity4 8 - 0 on saturday night , but three goals from @entity6 kept @entity7 on top in @entity9 ahead of next monday 's " @entity13 " clash between the @entity12 giants			1
@entity2 reached the milestone of 100 league goals for @entity3 in just 154 appearances for the defending champions , and has already scored 22 this season in all competitions			1
his third goal briefly lifted him above @entity6 as the league 's top scorer on 13 , putting the visitors seven up before the @entity24 laid on substitute @entity26 's second goal with 17 minutes to play			2
@entity3 led 5 - 0 at the halftime break , with @entity2 breaking the deadlock in the 17th minute after combining well with @entity29			1
@entity32 made it 2 - 0 a minute later after woeful defending by @entity4 , with his misplaced cross fortuitously rebounding back into his path , then @entity31 defender @entity30 turned @entity37 's low cross into his own net on 27			1
@entity39 embarrassed the onrushing @entity40 eight minutes later as he easily won the race to a long ball in the 35th minute , then soon after @entity2 netted from the winger 's low cross at the second attempt after the goalkeeper parried his first			0
@entity2 helped set up @entity26 's first in the 62nd minute , with the 20 - year - old showing nimble feet before dinking the ball over @entity40			2
the beleaguered @entity40 could only parry @entity49 's shot into @entity2 's pass for the seventh , and @entity26 made no mistake when sent free down the middle to seal the biggest win of the @entity9 season so far and leave @entity4 in the bottom three			1
the home side had conceded only 10 goals in 11 games -- the third best defensive record in the league behind @entity7 and @entity3 -- but coach @entity62 was sacked after the match			1
@entity3 travel to @entity64 on wednesday to face @entity65 in the @entity66 , then host @entity7 in a monday fixture forced due to security concerns over the @entity70 elections that weekend			2
@entity7 will take a one - point lead into that match following the 5 - 1 victory at home to @entity74 in the late match , as coach @entity76 completed his two - match touchline ban			1
with the @entity79 boss watching from various positions in the stands , @entity7 almost went behind in just the second minute when defender @entity82 had to clear off the line from @entity84			0
but @entity85 put @entity7 ahead in the 19th minute with a clinical low finish after fellow @entity24 @entity87 slipped a low pass into the penalty area , and @entity6 doubled the lead on the half - hour after @entity92 cleverly knocked the ball into his path			1
@entity9 striker @entity84 reduced the deficit five minutes before halftime from close range with his ninth league goal of the season , but @entity7 restored their two - goal buffer 11 minutes after the break			2
@entity87 duped @entity101 into bringing him down just inside the box , and defender @entity103 surprisingly stepped up to smash home the resulting penalty for his first goal of the campaign			0
@entity6 effectively sealed the win in the 62nd minute with a swerving free - kick that wrongfooted goalkeeper @entity111 could only palm into his net			0
the @entity113 forward then netted his 15th league goal this season -- and 17th overall -- from the penalty spot in time added on after substitute @entity119 was brought down , despite having to retake the kick after illegally stopping in his initial run - up			0
@entity74 , who hit the bar through @entity125 in the 87th minute , were left in ninth place -- 16 points behind @entity7			0
@entity128 retained third place after coming from behind to earn a 1 - 1 draw at home to 10 - man @entity132 , who stayed fourth			2
@entity135 put @entity132 ahead in the 20th minute with a deflected shot as @entity128 -- who had won all five previous home matches this season -- conceded at @entity140 for just the second time			0
@entity142 forward @entity143 gave his side a lifeline in the 73rd minute with a volley for his eighth @entity12 goal of the campaign as his team now trail real by eight points			0
@entity132 lost @entity152 defender @entity151 to a second yellow card with 10 minutes to go , but held on for the draw ahead of wednesday 's @entity66 clash with @entity157 side @entity156 .			0
