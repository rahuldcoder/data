, the new guy sounds remarkably like @entity6			2
in concert , the similarity became almost eerie : the band kicked off its set by nailing the first three tracks from 1992 's " dirt , " ( " @entity19 , " " @entity20 " and " @entity20 " ) , with @entity5 recreating @entity6 's vocal lines with the same studiousness of guitarist @entity23 , who delivered his solos note - for - note			1
in that sense , @entity3 have changed : the show felt more like a recital than an exorcism , as it would have with @entity6			1
still , the crowd responded with cheers when @entity23 introduced " rooster " by saying , " it 's been a long , strange trip , and i 'm really glad it 's still going			2
" it 's going great , in fact , " @entity12 " has sold over half a million copies and produced three number one tracks on the @entity41 chart			1
the band 's not on the nostalgia circuit : they 're arena rockers , and the polish they put on their music just comes with the territory			1
so do fans who know every word to the new songs , but shuffle off to buy a t - shirt during classic tracks like " @entity54 " and the ever - creepy " @entity55			1
" the set , though , cohered well , with the new acoustic song " @entity63 " sliding in alongside ' 94s " @entity58 " as if the two were written in the same era , and the " @entity12 " track " @entity62 " just as clobbering as the four older tunes that came before it			1
@entity23 and company are playing to their strengths , and on friday , they sounded about as strong as they ever have			2
opening act @entity71 , meanwhile , held their own , especially when they played more recent material , which blends dreamy atmospherics into the band 's ultra-heavy attack			2
frontman @entity77 , who has at times been criticized for sluggish performances , proved to be the night 's most energetic performer , bounding across the stage and unleashing his primal screams			0
before the show , @entity77 told " @entity0 " that he has reevaluated his lifestyle since a 2008 car accident that left original @entity71 bassist @entity86 in a semi-vegetative state			0
" i watched some old videos of us , and i got choked up , " he said			0
" it made me think about a lot of the things i was doing and the way i was living , and gave me an appreciation for life			0
my new drug is sweating			0
now i go onstage and i feel lighter on my feet -- i feel more agile			0
" the @entity71 and @entity3 sets both had an undercurrent of loss			1
but by night 's end , the overwhelming sense was of rebirth			0
