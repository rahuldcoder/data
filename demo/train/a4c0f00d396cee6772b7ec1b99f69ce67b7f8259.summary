-- there 's learning to read , and then there 's loving to read			1
as the end of the school year approaches , parents are stockpiling ideas to keep their children on top of those long summer reading lists			2
but how ? bestselling novelist and renowned nonfiction writer @entity10 raised three avid readers who are also a big part of her work			2
her eldest son , @entity15 , now 29 , helped research and write her 2004 travelogue , " @entity18 , " and her fun and foibles as a parent found their way into her other writing , without exposing too many details about them			0
( " books and columns come and go , but your kids are there forever , " she said			0
) @entity10 recently took some time on her tour to promote her new novel , " @entity33 with @entity34 , " to offer some guidance on raising kids who are passionate about reading			1
it 's never too early to read to children -- and do n't stop @entity10 and her husband , @entity39 , started reading to their three kids from the start			1
" we read to them from the time they were very little , " she said			0
when @entity15 was 5 , he showed his mother just how much the reading message hit home			2
" i took him for a school interview , which is a horrid rite of passage in @entity52			0
and the interviewer came out and said , ' and how long has he been reading ? ' and i said , ' oh he ca n't read			1
he 's only in kindergarten			0
' and she said , ' no , he reads			0
' i thought , ' oh i 'm the world 's worst mother			2
' " she laughed , and continued : " i said , ' @entity15 ? you can read ? ' he sort of shook his head			0
and i said , ' why did n't you tell me ? ' and he said , ' because i was afraid you would n't read to me anymore			1
' " so i told him then that i would read to him forever			0
" just because your children can read , does n't mean they do n't want to share books with their parents			2
sharing " @entity64 " with your children can be even more fun than reading it alone the first time			2
make reading the reward once kids can read by themselves , present books as a treat , rather than a task			1
even if their teachers ask them to read at home for 20 minutes a day after school , urge your children to read for an hour or more -- by choice			0
" ' all right , if you 're good tonight , you can read for a half an hour after you get into bed			0
' if you make reading seem like castor oil , it 's no surprise that your kids wo n't want to do it			1
if you make it seem like chocolate pudding and a milkshake combined , they will be thrilled to do it , " @entity10 said			1
be a model reader the more you read yourself , the more children will yearn to read often , too			2
fill your home with books , whether on tablets or tables , and make sure your kids see you reading , and enjoying it			0
@entity10 said her three children grew up seeing their mother behind a book so often that they might ask : " ' what does mom 's face look like when there 's not a book in front of it ? does anyone remember ? ' " be the reader you want your children to become			1
match books to children 's interests ... take advantage of the wide range of books for children			1
@entity10 advises , " if you have a boy who is an indefatigable jock , do n't give him ' @entity116			2
' that 's not his book			0
give him @entity120 's biography of @entity121			0
or give him some great young adult novel about a baseball team			0
once you know who your kids are , you 've got to pick out the books that are right for them			0
" other reading experts agree that getting children excited about reading involves knowing them well , and choosing books that cater to their interests			2
" one of the best ways to inspire children to read is to help them find books that speak to them as individuals , so that reading is n't this isolated , fraught activity that they do at school , " says @entity136 @entity135 , an assistant professor at the @entity137 who specializes in children 's literature			1
" it 's an infinitely fertile field to be in			0
" @entity150 teaches @entity152 's books to undergraduates at the @entity137 , and cites the author who wrote " @entity157 " , " @entity158 , " and many others as one of her favorites			2
for children who are accustomed to having adults make all of the decisions about their lives , @entity152 's stories are a refreshing escape			1
" he really turns the tables on who has the power in his books , " she said			0
" usually it 's children who are powerful , and adults who are ridiculous			0
" try something different for parents and kids from @entity152 , to @entity179 , to dr. @entity180 and others , young readers are spoiled for choice			1
there 's a reason why dr. @entity180 in particular gets a nationwide celebration -- or @entity186 , for those in the know -- on his birthday , march 2 : he created a niche with his wacky characters , and accessible writing style			1
" it 's a really simple vocabulary ; it 's easy to begin to read , if you 're a beginning reader , but ( the books ) still have a really great sense of humor , " said @entity193 , a children 's librarian in @entity195			1
" there is so much packed in there that builds a lifetime love of reading			0
" children 's books have come a long way since the days of " @entity209 , " which seem a bit stilted next to what 's on today 's bookshelves			1
now , most children 's books have intricate illustrations , and wildly imaginative plots			1
" what mostly attracts me to children 's literature is how complex it is , " @entity150 said			1
" we often have a misconception that children 's literature is literature for adults with simpler language , and happy endings			1
" really , children 's literature brings their fears and frustrations to life			1
@entity150 cited @entity179 's " @entity232 , " about a boy who gets sent to bed without his supper , but can imagine a world where he rules a land of wild giants			2
for parents , revisiting favorite stories from their own childhoods can engage them in reading along with their kids , and inspire them to beg for the next book			0
as @entity10 said , " i made it seem like reading was the greatest thing since sliced bread because that 's how i feel			1
" by the end of the summer , parents and kids who follow her advice might feel the same way			0
which books made you want to read more as a child ? share your favorites in the comments , on @entity261 or on @entity264 's @entity263 page !			0

want to raise a reader ? be the reader you want your children to be , experts say
@entity10 's son pretended he could n't read so his mother would keep reading to him
@entity10 : make reading a reward , " like chocolate pudding and a milkshake combined "
children 's literature experts love @entity152 , dr. @entity180 and @entity179
