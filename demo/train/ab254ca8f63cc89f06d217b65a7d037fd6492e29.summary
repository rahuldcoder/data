@entity1 , @entity0 -- hundreds of thousands of children worldwide are thought to be working full - time on tobacco farms , suffering from toxic levels of nicotine exposure and abusive labor conditions			1
children as young as five - years - old work on tobacco farms in @entity11 , according to @entity12			1
in @entity11 alone there are an estimated 78,000 boys and girls employed in tobacco harvesting			0
on average they earn 17 cents for a 12 - hour day of back - breaking , bare - handed work , according to a recent report from @entity12			1
handling burley tobacco leaves without gloves , in unwashed clothes and rarely bathing , these children can absorb the same amount of nicotine in one day of harvesting that they would from smoking 50 cigarettes			1
" sometimes it feels like you do n't have enough breath ... you reach a point where you can not breathe because of the pain in your chest			1
then the blood comes when you vomit			0
at the end , most of this dies and then you remain with a headache , " the report quoted one child describing how he felt at the end of the day			1
see pictures of @entity11 's child tobacco farmers Â» " nicotine is water soluble and can enter via the skin , so if it has recently rained , or there is heavy dew , the nicotine migrates into the water on the leaf			1
if that water gets on to your shirt it essentially becomes a giant nicotine patch , " explained @entity52 of the @entity53			1
after reading the @entity12 report , @entity52 , who has researched @entity61 ( @entity62 ) in children working on tobacco farms in the @entity65 , told @entity2 that the @entity11 children 's symptoms were " absolutely " consistent with @entity62			1
the minister of labor for @entity11 , @entity69 , has denied the findings of the @entity12 report and told @entity2 their figures were " absolute trash			1
" according to @entity69 , the government has been hard at work with @entity76 for the past two years to eliminate child labor and has made substantial progress			2
" no estate - owner has ever employed children age five to 14 , " he added			2
in 2007 @entity76 estimated that 29 percent of children ages five to 14 - years - old in @entity11 worked , and that the majority of those children worked in agriculture			2
there are more than 30,000 smallholder farmers in tobacco production and the crop contributes 70 percent of foreign exchange and 30 percent of @entity90 , according to the government web site			0
figures aside , the pictures speak for themselves , showing that the danger of nicotine poisoning is real and that better regulation and monitoring is needed			2
" there are a couple of things that could prevent this , like you should wash or change shirts , " @entity52 said , citing a study in which sweat rung out from tobacco workers ' shirts contained up to @entity101 of nicotine			1
as well as exploitative conditions , the children described repeated physical and sexual abuse from their supervisors			1
many of the kids also complained of " sticky stuff " from the stalks that they could not wash off their hands because they had no access to soap or water , according to @entity121 , who interviewed the children first - hand for the @entity12 report			1
" we are busy working and we do n't have time to go for bathing , so we develop those sores , " one 15 - year - old girl told @entity121			2
the 44 children she interviewed were working full - time on both large estates and small family farms , but none were working for their own families , and 36 of them were orphans			2
the main reason the children gave for working was poverty : lack of food , clothing or money to go to school were frequently cited			2
" a lot think it 's fine for children to work			0
they do n't see the dangers of the pesticides or the opportunity cost of not going to school , " said @entity145 , an expert in hazardous child labor at the @entity147 ( @entity147 ) , referring to farmers in @entity149			0
" the new globalization of agriculture has a tendency to increase the demand for child labor , " explained @entity145			0
when you have growers that are working under contract to larger companies , in industries such as tobacco , sugar or flowers , the contract is made with the adults , who in turn use their families to reach a quota or get a livable income			0
" in recent years multinational tobacco corporations have been rapidly shifting farming production away from rich countries like the @entity65			0
nearly 75 percent of tobacco production is now done in developing countries such as @entity11 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183			0
re-location to poorer states by multinational firms increases the demand for all types of labor their , not just that of children , according to professor @entity192 of @entity193			0
if anything , she argues , increased investment can actually bring higher salaries and improved monitoring of abuse			0
" if children are working in the tobacco fields , they are probably very poor and the alternatives could be even worse , " she said			0
" i firmly believe that engagement by international corporations in @entity206 agriculture must happen , but they should be monitored on all fronts			0
" today @entity76 , the @entity147 , @entity12 and others all remain active in @entity11 , working with the government to develop links between the ministries of labor and agriculture to end child labor on tobacco farms			0
since the report came out in august , @entity12 told @entity2 in an email that " the government has been constructive in their response and are discussing / looking to work with @entity12 to conduct a national survey to gauge the true scale of the issue and better enforcement of existing child labor laws			1
