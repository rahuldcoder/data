-- the @entity1 is an exceptional country			1
on this , almost all @entity1 politicians agree			2
and millions of @entity1 , do too , according to recent polls			2
more than three centuries after @entity8 first preached that the new @entity10 would be a " city upon a hill , " presidents @entity5 and @entity7 both reiterated his admonition that " the eyes of all people are upon us			0
" for president @entity15 , the @entity1 is " not just a place on a map , but the light to the world			1
" this broad agreement on @entity1 exceptionalism is often overlooked			2
this is especially so for conservatives , who now demand allegiance to the idea and chastise @entity15 , despite all evidence to the contrary , for not believing sufficiently in the exceptional nature of the country he leads			1
@entity31 is a flashpoint in @entity1 politics today not because the claim is contested , but because conservatives and liberals hold differing views of what makes the @entity1 exceptional			1
these differences are at the core of our current fights over foreign policy			0
conservatives believe the @entity1 is exceptional because its people are inherently good			1
by and large , @entity1 are upstanding , moral individuals who instinctively support noble policies in our relations with other countries			2
nonetheless , conservatives are much more likely than liberals to believe that @entity1 values and culture are superior to those of other nations			1
in a recent @entity57 poll , 63 % of conservatives believe our culture is superior to others , compared with just 45 % for moderates and 34 % for liberals			1
although the decline in overall support for this view of cultural superiority from 60 % in 2002 to only 49 % today received the headline attention , the dispersion across political ideologies is perhaps even more important			0
for conservatives compared with liberals , @entity1 exceptionalism rests in large part on a belief in the country 's superior culture and values			1
this conservative version of " @entity1 the exceptional " was on full display among the @entity80 candidates in the recent @entity0 debate on foreign policy			1
conservatives expect other countries to recognize the inherent goodness of the @entity1 people and the foreign policies produced by our government , and to accept our international leadership because of our self - evident virtue			1
indeed , many conservatives call for a foreign policy that is free of constraints by the @entity95 or other multilateral institutions precisely because they believe accommodating the desires of other countries would limit our ability to act on our goodness			0
it is striking that the most avid proponents of an assertive unilateralism in which other countries are expected to trust us -- and our government -- simply because we are good are the same conservatives who so distrust government at home			0
in the words of @entity7 , endorsed by all the current major @entity80 candidates , " government is the problem , not the solution			0
" in relations with other countries , however , many conservatives argue that the goodness of the @entity1 will be translated directly into action			1
economic or social policy at home may be distorted and even captured by " special interests , " but foreign policy remains pure and reflects the high morals of the @entity1 people			2
how government can be " the problem " in domestic policy and untainted in its actions toward others is never addressed			0
liberals see the @entity1 as exceptional because of our principles of limited government , embedded in the @entity134			1
accepting that inherently good @entity1 often have different ideas of what goodness means , liberals celebrate our system of checks and balances			2
although few liberals believe in the cultural superiority of the @entity1 people , 73 % of @entity145 in a 2010 @entity148 / @entity147 poll believe that its " history and its @entity134 " make the @entity1 " the greatest country in the world			1
" this is the view of @entity1 exceptionalism held by @entity15			1
as he stated in a 2009 news conference in @entity156 , @entity157 , " i think we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our @entity134 , in our body of law , in our democratic practices , in our belief in free speech and equality , that , though imperfect , are exceptional			2
" contemporary liberals support a larger , more activist role for government at home and abroad because they trust that the competing branches of government will limit the influence of what @entity174 called " factions			0
" expecting the government to usually " do the right thing " because of its institutional constraints , liberals are more comfortable giving it a larger role in our lives			0
liberals extend the principles of limited government to the international arena			0
believing that a leader needs followers , and that followers will only follow if the leader can be trusted , liberals embrace multilateralism			0
it is only by creating opportunities for other countries to voice their preferences and to shape @entity1 policy through joint decision - making that other countries will accept the unique leadership status of the @entity1 , they believe			2
in this view , the @entity1 can and should welcome limits on its freedom of action abroad -- just as it does at home			0
according to the @entity57 poll , 57 % of liberals believe the @entity1 should get @entity95 approval before using military force , while only 38 % of conservatives say this is an important step			1
these competing views of exceptionalism mean that too often @entity1 talk past one another			0
although most of us agree that the @entity1 is exceptional , we do so for very different reasons			2
@entity31 has become a conservative trope , a rhetorical tool with which to challenge the nationalism of liberals			0
focusing more on values , a strong majority of @entity80 in the @entity147 poll report that they do not believe @entity15 thinks the @entity1 is exceptional , whereas an overwhelming majority of @entity145 believe he does			1
rather than painting liberals as unpatriotic , conservatives should hold up a mirror to their own view and reflect on the contradiction			0
how they can believe that the will of the people is always distorted at home but flawlessly translated into policy abroad is , well , exceptional			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			0

belief that @entity1 is an exceptional country is *widely* shared in the @entity1
@entity241 says it 's become a flashpoint , as conservatives dispute @entity15 's belief in it
he says liberals believe @entity1 is exceptional because of its constitutional *safeguards*
@entity253 : conservatives are more likely to believe @entity1 is culturally superior to rest of world
