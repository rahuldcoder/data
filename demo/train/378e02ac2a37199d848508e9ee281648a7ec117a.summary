-- @entity1 is doubling down on his apology for his recent @entity4 interview			1
the @entity6 actor appeared on " @entity7 " on wednesday to say in person what he 's already said to the @entity10 in a letter : he very much regrets the remarks he made to @entity4 about @entity14 people and @entity15			1
@entity1 apologizes for remarks " i said some things that were poorly considered , " a subdued @entity1 told @entity17			1
" once i saw it in print , i could see that it was offensive , insensitive , pernicious and ill - informed			2
" in the @entity4 interview , @entity1 gives his unfiltered opinion on political correctness and how it 's impacted controversial actors like @entity28 and @entity29 , the latter of whom has used anti-semitic language in the past			1
" @entity29 is in a town that 's run by @entity14 and he said the wrong thing because he 's actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him -- and does n't need to feed him anymore because he 's got enough dough , " @entity1 told the magazine			1
" but some @entity14 guy in his office somewhere has n't turned and said , ' that f * * king kraut ' or ' f * * k those @entity42 , ' whatever it is ? we all hide and try to be so politically correct			2
that 's what gets me			2
it 's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone			0
" @entity1 goes off on hypocrisy , political correctness within a day of @entity4 releasing its interview , @entity1 wrote the @entity10 to tell it he was " deeply remorseful " for what he said			1
and on " @entity7 , " @entity1 took the extra step to also apologize to his fans			1
" words have meaning , and they carry weight long after you 've said them , " he said			0
" i do n't condone or excuse the words that i used in any context			0
... i am profoundly , profoundly sorry and deeply apologetic			0
especially to the fans , they 've been so incredible to me , and i really feel that i let them down			0
... i 'm a public figure , i should be an example and an inspiration			0
and i 'm an a-hole			0
i 'm 56 , and i should know better			0
" @entity1 also thanked @entity17 for giving him the opportunity to appear on the show and speak his piece , to which @entity17 replied , " i 'm so happy that someone has to apologize on this show , and it 's not me for once			2
