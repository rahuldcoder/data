@entity1 , @entity0 -- as little @entity7 faded away , her tiny , frail body wracked with pain , her heartbroken mother was left to look on , feeling powerless			1
@entity8 says she could do nothing to help her terminally ill baby in the last hours of her life			1
" in that period , they tell you it 's best not to give any fluids , because babies survive on little drops of liquid , " she said			0
" so we stopped feeding her			0
in the end , it was bones and skin and no more baby left			1
" ten - month - old @entity7 died two years ago with @entity27 disease , a rare and terminal genetic mutation that damages the nervous system			1
in the final days of @entity7 's life , when she was being given palliative sedation , van @entity32 , of @entity34 , @entity0 , says she could still see the agony on her daughter 's face			1
" she died on tuesday ; on monday , we saw on her face that she was still in pain			1
and then you start to get angry , because you know that there is no medication left to give her to take away that pain			1
" she wishes she could have administered a fatal dose of medication to make the end of her daughter 's short life come more quickly			2
unbearable suffering @entity0 legalized euthanasia in 2002 for those in " constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that can not be alleviated			1
" minors were included in the original proposals but were left out of the final legislation for political reasons			2
now , the country 's lawmakers are debating a bill which would extend the " right to die " to those under the age of 18 who are terminally ill and in intolerable physical pain			1
the bill cleared a senate committee vote on wednesday ; it must clear several other hurdles before becoming law			2
since @entity7 was only a baby , her case would never have qualified for euthanasia			1
under the current rules , the patient must be able to make a repeated request for euthanasia themselves while experiencing unbearable suffering of which there is no prospect for improvement			2
but van @entity32 believes that children , and parents of sick babies , should have more options , including the right to choose when to die			2
" we want those children to be able to talk about euthanasia , and if they really want to say : ' stop , this is it			1
i do n't want it anymore , ' we want people to have a choice , " she said			0
polls show the majority of @entity0 agree with the principle of offering euthanasia to children			1
the current debate is less about whether or not to extend the legislation and more about what conditions to apply to the law : from what age euthanasia should be available and whether that should be with or without parental consent			1
parental consent this month , 16 pediatricians wrote an open letter in two national newspapers demanding an extension of the practice			0
@entity112 from the @entity1 was one of them			0
" doctors do terminate the lives of children as well as adults , but today it 's done in a gray zone or in the dark because it 's illegal , " he said			2
" this means that there 's a lot of room to do things the wrong way			0
" @entity128 stresses that only a tiny number of children would ever choose to end their lives this way : children with cancer , for example , who are still in charge of their cognitive faculties but in terrible pain			1
@entity138 is a researcher at the @entity1 focusing on end - of - life care and euthanasia			1
he has compared end of life practice in @entity143 before and after euthanasia was legalized in 2002 , to gauge whether there has been a slippery slope			2
he says his research shows that although the number of euthanasia requests has gone up , from 1.1 % before 2002 to 1.9 % by 2008 , the number of instances in which doctors have hastened the end of life without patient consent has gone down considerably			1
and he says minors are only a very small fraction of those deaths in any case			1
" people dying underage mostly die of accidents or trauma , so very sudden deaths where no end - of - life decision making is possible , " he said			0
" and a euthanasia request is very rare in those patients			2
" @entity138 argues that the debate in @entity0 is more one of principle than anything else ; only very few children would ever choose euthanasia but that the law now discriminates against them			1
palliative care experiences in the @entity177 , where patients older than 12 are allowed to request euthanasia with their parents ' consent , would seem to support this : only five children have chosen to die by euthanasia since the law was introduced in 2002			1
but critics say children can not reasonably decide whether to end their own lives			2
palliative nurse @entity189 , who specializes in end - of - life care for children , says that among the 200 children she 's nursed to their deaths , she 's never met a child who asked for death to come early			1
" the main concern for children is always for the family , " she said			2
" it 's difficult for a child , because he feels he 's slipping away , but he can not tell his parents as that 's not what they want to hear			0
" children say to me , ' it 's not difficult to die , but please look after my parents			2
' " @entity189 worries that giving children a choice would mean they made decisions based on what they thought their families wanted to hear , and that this would be a terrible strain for children who may already feel they are a burden to their caregivers			0
one of @entity189 's patients is @entity219 , who has @entity221 's disease , a neurological disease that drastically reduces life expectancy in children			0
eight years ago , she was a bubbling , active child -- top of her class , according to her mother , @entity229			0
now , having just turned 18 , she ca n't eat or walk without help			0
she finds it difficult to speak , but her mind is still her own			0
in a painful exchange , her mother explains to her what euthanasia is , using the simplest terms she can think of			0
" euthanasia means if you are unwell , you are so unhappy that you do n't want to stay here , you want to leave , to go high up to @entity240 , " she said			0
" but if you leave , you leave forever			0
" @entity219 listens , the strain showing on her face			0
" do you think it 's good or not good ? " her mother asks			0
" it 's not good			0
" the words are barely audible			0
