-- if someone today argued for laws to legally bar interracial marriage that person would universally be labeled a bigot			2
but in 1967 when the @entity6 @entity7 in loving v. @entity8 struck down state laws prohibiting interracial marriage , 73 % of @entity6 still supported them			2
did that mean that more than 70 % of @entity6 at that time were bigots ? no. but there certainly came a time that you were one if you continued advocating for such discriminatory laws			0
are we at that point yet with gay marriage ? is it fair to label a person a bigot simply for arguing that marriage should only be between a man and a woman ? that 's the first issue we discussed in episode 2 of the new weekly @entity0 podcast " the @entity29 , " co-hosted by @entity0 opinion contributors @entity31 , @entity32 and myself			1
each week we look at three big issues making news			0
( for those catching up , our first episode is here			0
) to listen to this episode of " the @entity29 , " click on the @entity40 audio player on this page			1
or you can find us on @entity43			0
in the new episode , here are the three topics we chose to discuss / fight / yell / joke about : 1			0
are you a bigot if you oppose gay marriage ? @entity31 raised the issue of whether we throw the word " bigot " around too quickly			1
she also posed the thought - provoking question : would we would have called president @entity56 a bigot a year ago before he embraced marriage equality ? my response is " yes " with an asterisk			1
the asterisk being that i wo n't yet call anyone who opposes marriage equality a bigot simply because they believe marriage should be between a man and woman			1
( if you demonize gays , than i will call you one now			0
) but in time , that label will be accurate for those who continue to advocate discrimination			0
@entity32 , being the centrist that he is , made a very fair point that this is a process and it will take time			1
representative @entity79 being investigated by the @entity80			1
our own @entity32 broke this story in the @entity83 on monday			1
while i disagree with @entity79 on almost every issue , as a comedian i would hate to see her go			1
she is a less intellectual @entity87 , which equals comedy gold			0
but @entity31 cites actual accomplishments by @entity79 in @entity91 as a member of the @entity93			1
( i know , @entity79 serving on the @entity93 is irony defined			2
) so will @entity79 be forced out of @entity91 , or will she remain in office much to the delight of a few people on the right -- and comedians everywhere ? 3			2
in the past , when politicians were caught in a scandal , they disappeared			2
today , our disgraced politicians are like " @entity106 " from the " friday the 13th " movies			0
they just keep coming back			0
former @entity109 gov. @entity108 -- who had been caught sneaking away from his state to meet his mistress in @entity112 -- is back and a favorite to win the @entity115 nomination for @entity91 in a special election next week			0
and last week it was disclosed that former congressman @entity118 -- of @entity120 underwear photo fame -- spent more than $ 100,000 on polls to explore running for mayor of @entity123			0
are we such a forgiving people that they will succeed , as @entity31 believes ? or is it all part of our reality show mentality that rewards fame , as @entity32 and i argued ? we hope you will check out this episode and let us know what you think			1
