@entity38 secured a fifth win in six outings by ending @entity42 's hopes of progressing with a one - sided victory in @entity70			1
@entity71 ( 69 ) , @entity72 ( 52 ) and opener @entity73 ( 51 ) all made half - centuries as the @entity40 compiled a daunting 284 - 8 , with captain @entity76 contributing 45 to a first - wicket stand of 97			0
