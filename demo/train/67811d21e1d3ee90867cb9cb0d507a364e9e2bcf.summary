no matter what the ballots say , friday will be historic for college sports			1
by noon , members of @entity5 's football team will have cast the ballots that will decide whether they will form a workers union and start demanding more rights			1
it 's a massive step toward changing the longstanding model of the @entity11 , and the pressure has been mounting			0
there is some doubt that a majority will vote for it -- even though there initially seemed to be a lot of support on the team			1
how they vote wo n't be immediately known , since on thursday the @entity21 granted @entity5 's request to review a regional @entity21 director 's decision that the players are employees of the university			1
it could be months before that review takes place and the votes wo n't be made public until that happens			0
since the initial signatures were acquired and the petition was filed in january , the two main forces behind the union push -- @entity36 president @entity35 and former @entity5 quarterback @entity37 -- went on a whirlwind tour meeting with lawmakers and lobbyists and speaking publicly about the push			1
they became especially vocal in february when @entity43 , @entity21 regional director in @entity44 , ruled in their favor			0
@entity47 agreed with their argument that the athletes are employees of the university who make money for their employer and are compensated with an education			2
the @entity44 director agreed with them on almost every point they made at the hearing -- the most important being a recognition that athletes spend 40 to 50 hours a week focused on football -- well more than the maximum 20 that is allowed by the @entity11			2
but with that win came an influx of dissent from all directions			0
former and current players , high - profile coaches , lawyers , lawmakers , college presidents , even some vocal @entity11 reform advocates publicly said they did n't think a union was a good idea			1
@entity5 head coach @entity76 , who initially tweeted in support of his former starting quarterback initiative , met with the current teammates and told them he did n't think a union was in their best interest			1
two of the team 's top leaders -- current quarterback @entity82 and running back @entity85 -- backed their coach and publicly said they would not be voting in favor of unionizing			0
" i just hope the @entity11 does understand some things do need to change , " @entity85 told reporters after a spring practice on april 19 , " but we do not need a third party to come in between us and the coaches			0
" a majority of the players who decide to cast a vote must vote in favor of the union for it to be successful			1
meanwhile , today , the @entity11 appears to be trying to answer some of the concerns of the reform advocates by proposing changes that would give the five power conferences -- @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 -- more options in how they treat athletes			0
among many proposed changes , the @entity11 may consider allowing schools to increase scholarships to cover the cost of living , and not just the cost of tuition , for athletes			2
this all comes weeks after a class - action lawsuit filed by current players who want the @entity11 compensation cap to be erased , and more than a month before trial is set to begin in the case of former @entity124 basketball player @entity123 lawsuit 's against the @entity11			0
@entity123 is suing on behalf of current football and men 's basketball players , and is seeking to get them a share of the millions that the @entity11 makes off of their likenesses .			2

@entity5 football players vote friday on whether to unionize
there is some doubt a majority will vote for it , though support was *strong* initially
many athletes , coaches , college presidents and others say a union is a *bad* idea
supporters say athletes , who generate huge money for schools , *deserve* *protections*
