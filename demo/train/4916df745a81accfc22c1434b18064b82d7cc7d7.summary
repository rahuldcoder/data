-- @entity1 had taken @entity2 out to lunch			0
this was in the summer of 1973 ; the wife of one president and the widow of another talked quietly in the dining room of the @entity10			0
i had traveled to @entity12 to cover the @entity14 hearings , which of course centered on the first lady 's husband , and i had unexpectedly been invited to lunch by the other person at my table , which was just a few feet from where mrs. @entity22 and mrs. @entity2 were eating			2
" what did you think ? " @entity25 asked me			1
he drank a cup of coffee and waited for his omelet to arrive			0
" when you were riding the planes and looking at the crowds every day , did you think we 'd lost it ? " @entity25 , an unabashed liberal voice , dies only one year before , he had been traveling the country campaigning nonstop , the @entity35 candidate for president			1
he had hoped to be living in the @entity38			0
now , in that summer of ' 73 , having suffered a landslide defeat at the hands of @entity41 , he was a @entity42 senator who had just come out of a routine and dreary agriculture subcommittee meeting which had lasted all morning and would resume after the lunch break			2
" did you think we never had a chance from the convention on ? " @entity25 asked			1
the @entity50 campaign had been my first			2
@entity25 had done his best to get to know the people assigned to cover him , even the neophytes , so i had been pleased that a year after his defeat he would take the time to get a bite to eat with me			1
he died on sunday at age 90 in @entity58 , @entity59 , the same town where he had made his concession speech to @entity1 on a cold november night 40 years ago			1
in the sometimes unforgiving world of political acrimony -- left vs. right , conservative vs.liberal -- it is easy to reduce national candidates to cartoon figures			0
but whatever anyone may have thought of @entity25 's ideology , he was an awfully good guy			1
and for those who casually categorized him as " soft , " as his political opponents sometimes did , i always offer the suggestion : unless you flew 35 @entity78 combat missions over @entity80 - occupied @entity79 as the pilot of a b - 24 bomber , as he did , and were awarded the @entity83 for your valor , as he was , maybe you ought to hold up a little bit before you offhandedly call a man like @entity25 soft			1
" because it was the crowds that convinced me that the polls were wrong , " @entity25 was saying at lunch			1
" i simply could n't conceive that the crowds could be so big and enthusiastic , and that the polls could be so drastically negative at the same time			0
that 's the one thing that still puzzles me a little			2
" opinion : @entity25 ahead of his time the setting for this conversation bordered on the surreal			1
@entity25 had spent that whole doomed campaign trying in vain to convince the country that he , not @entity1 , should be president			1
now , in the @entity104 , not only were mrs. @entity22 and mrs. eisenhower sitting across the way , but also at nearby tables having lunch were three men who were gaining enormous celebrity as members of the @entity14 committee , which was in the midst of holding its nationally televised hearings in the @entity115 : @entity116 of @entity117 , @entity118 of @entity119 and @entity120 of @entity121			0
the country 's eyes were riveted on them every day , on every broadcast network			2
" no , i really have n't watched the @entity14 hearings too much , " @entity25 said			1
" oh , once in a while when i go into the @entity10 cloakroom the tv set in there is turned on , and i watch it for a few minutes			0
but i do n't watch the reruns at night			0
it 's kind of hard for me to watch the hearings anyway ; i guess i feel a little more personally involved in what they 're about than most people do			2
" the night before , he told me , he had been invited to a party at which president @entity1 had also been a guest			0
it was the first time he had encountered @entity1 in person since the election			0
in the receiving line , when the two had come face to face , both men smiled broadly , if uneasily , and news photographers snapped pictures of the moment			0
" as soon as i was invited to that party , " @entity25 said , " i knew the situation was going to come up			1
... i did n't think that was the picture they 'd take			0
there was another time when @entity1 and ( then - @entity158 ) @entity157 and i were all going to be standing together , and i figured that was the picture they 'd take			0
... what did people expect me to do when i got to @entity1 ? do this ? " politicians pay tribute @entity25 scowled comically and began waving his finger in the air , as if scolding @entity1			1
" could n't very well do that , " he said , laughing			0
the news stories about @entity25 's passing said that death came to him at the @entity171 in @entity58			1
when i saw that , i had a feeling			0
a man named @entity177 was one of @entity25 's dear @entity59 friends			1
he had risen to the position of lieutenant governor of the state ; he was with @entity50 to offer consolation on that night in @entity58 when the election results came in			0
@entity177 died in 2010 ; the hospice facility was named in his honor			2
so @entity25 spent the last days of his life back in @entity59 , within the welcoming walls of a building bearing the name of his old friend			1
home , and friendship : sustaining and real in a way that vote totals and lofty titles can never compete with			2
if you 're lucky , that is			0
highlights of @entity25 's life the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			1

@entity202 lunched with @entity25 after the senator 's failed presidential bid
he says @entity25 *wondered* then whether his campaign had seemed doomed to *reporters*
he says some called @entity25 soft , but he was a valorous @entity78 combat pilot ; also a good guy
@entity202 : @entity25 was surrounded by home , friendship when he died sunday
