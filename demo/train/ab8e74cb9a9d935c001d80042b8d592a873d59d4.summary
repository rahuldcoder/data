@entity0 -- what appeared to be smoke was rising tuesday from two adjacent reactors in the damaged @entity7 nuclear power plant , a nuclear safety official said			1
@entity8 spewed monday from the same reactors , setbacks that came despite fervent efforts to prevent the further release of radioactive materials at the stricken facility			1
@entity15 , an official with @entity17 's @entity16 , said smoke was rising from the plant 's no. 2 and no. 3 reactors			1
it was not immediately clear why			2
on monday , after 6 p.m. , white smoke was seen emanating from the facility 's no. 2 reactor , according to @entity15			1
about two hours earlier , workers were evacuated from the area around the no. 3 reactor after gray smoke began to rise from the wreckage of its steel - and - concrete housing , which was blown apart by a hydrogen explosion last week			2
the no. 3 reactor has been the top priority for authorities trying to contain damage to the plant and stave off a possible meltdown			2
its fuel includes a small percentage of plutonium mixed with the uranium in its fuel rods , which experts say could cause more harm than regular uranium fuels in the event of a meltdown			2
@entity15 said there was no evident explosion , spike in radiation or injuries at the no. 3 reactor monday			2
the smoke was coming from the building 's southeastern side , where the reactor 's spent nuclear fuel pool is located , but the origin of the smoke at either reactor was unknown			1
the coolant pools contain spent fuel rods that still generate high amounts of heat			1
authorities have been working to keep them full to prevent the rods from being exposed			0
the nuclear agency estimated that , between roughly 9 p.m. sunday to 4 a.m. monday , 1,170 tons of water were sprayed on the reactor and its fuel pool			0
in @entity77 , @entity74 , the head of the @entity76 warned that while signs of improvement at the site are evident , the plant " has been seriously damaged by flood water and is littered with debris			0
" " the crisis has still not been resolved , and the situation at the @entity7 nuclear power plant remains very serious , " @entity84 , the director - general of the @entity86 nuclear watchdog agency , told its board of governors monday after a visit to the site			0
" buildings have been damaged by explosions , " he said			0
" there has , for the most part , been no electric power			0
it is no exaggeration to describe the work of the emergency teams as heroic			0
" on the other hand , @entity84 told reporters , rising pressure inside the containment unit at reactor no. 3 , a concern from the weekend , was down and power had been restored to some of the reactors			0
the plant 's owner , the @entity115 , has been working to restore electricity to the damaged plant after it was hit by the massive earthquake and tsunami the struck northern @entity17 on march 11			1
the electric company told @entity1 on monday that electrical cables had been laid to connect the no. 3 reactor and the neighboring no. 4 reactor with an outside power source			0
that meant that power could now be funneled to all six of the plant 's reactors for its cooling systems			1
but electricity was still not moving to units no. 1 through no. 4 because the quake and tsunami had damaged numerous pumps and other gear			0
a @entity115 official said spare parts were being brought in so that everything could work again			1
the disaster has killed more than 8,900 people and left close to 13,000 missing , many of them killed as a wall of water rushed in following the quake			0
ever since , authorities have been working to avert further crisis -- and prevent more deaths -- at the @entity7 plant , some 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0			0
those efforts include the possibility of encasing one or more of the reactors in concrete , a last - ditch effort similar to what was done after the 1986 meltdown at the @entity158 nuclear plant in the @entity159 -- considered the worst nuclear disaster at a plant			0
@entity17 's nuclear agency said monday that it expected to conduct tests on what it called a " concrete pump engine , " which the agency initially said would pump a mix of mortar and water into the no. 4 reactor 's spent nuclear fuel pool and containment vessel , the agency said			1
but @entity115 said later that the device would be used only to pour water , not the mortar mixture			0
in just over two hours on monday morning alone , 13 fire engines sprayed about 90 tons of water toward that reactor in an attempt to cool it down			0
a @entity115 official told @entity1 that six workers trying to restore electricity to that reactor have been exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation			2
for reference , an individual in a developed country naturally is exposed to 3 millisieverts of radiation a year -- though @entity17 's @entity188 has reset the exposure level upward to 250 millisieverts for those trying to combat the crisis at the @entity7 plant			2
that is 2.5 times the previous limit , according to the ministry			0
these efforts came as concerns remained high about the impact that already emitted radiation has had on food , water and people within range of the @entity7 facility			1
very small amounts -- far below the level of concern -- of radioactive iodine have been detected in tap water in @entity0 and most prefectures near the plant			1
the health ministry said levels of radioactive iodine three times greater than the regulated standard were found in drinking water in a village near the plant and asked residents not to drink from the tap , @entity212 reported sunday			1
high levels of radioactive substances have also been found in seawater near the plant , @entity115 said tuesday , adding that the results do not represent a threat to human health			1
the @entity17 government has banned the sale of raw milk from @entity234 , where the plant is located , and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring @entity238 after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards , the country 's health ministry reported			1
and officials in @entity7 halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture			0
chief cabinet secretary @entity246 said the contaminated milk detected in @entity234 had not been distributed or sold			1
on saturday , officials said tainted milk was found 30 kilometers ( about 18 miles ) from the plant , and spinach was collected as far as 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) to the south , almost halfway to @entity0			1
that prompted a statement of concern from the @entity256 , which said early monday that the spread of contamination was " more serious " than initially expected			0
" it 's new and something we 're watching , " @entity256 spokesman @entity259 told @entity1			2
but he said the reported levels of radioactivity posed no short - term health risk , and @entity17 officials were taking a " very precautionary " stance			1
" nobody is seeing that there 's an immediate health problem , " @entity259 said			1
the latest results accumulated and posted online by @entity17 's @entity272 showed slight but notable upticks in airborne radiation readings around @entity17 in recent days			2
but even the highest readings -- .11 millisieverts some 30 kilometers northwest of the plant -- were still considered significantly below what 's considered dangerous to humans			2
nevertheless , the @entity280 @entity279 pulled out of its port in @entity282 , about 45 kilometers ( 28 miles ) south of @entity0 , " as a precaution , " according to a posting on the ship 's facebook page			1
the ship will remain off the coast of @entity17 , the posting said			0
the @entity290 previously repositioned the @entity291 after radiation detectors found minute traces of contamination on sailors and equipment			2
the @entity299 military is also considering the mandatory evacuation of thousands of @entity299 troops and their families in @entity17 out of concern over rising radiation levels , a senior defense official tells @entity1			1
the official , who did not want to be on the record talking about ongoing deliberations , said the talks have focused exclusively on @entity299 troops in @entity282 , just south of @entity0			1
@entity282 is home to @entity299 's largest naval base in @entity17			1
the @entity299 will start tuesday to distribute potassium iodide pills to government , military and civilian personnel and their dependants , " out of an abundance of caution , " the @entity312 said monday			1
the pills are commonly prescribed to curb the ill effects of radiation exposure			0
nature has helped to minimize airborne exposure since the quake , as winds from the northwest have blown many emissions from the plant out to sea			0
but the wind direction is expected to change through wednesday , potentially pushing more of the material to the southwest and over land			0
" people are watching , " said @entity335 , who lives in @entity336			0
" and people have greater concern than ever about the nuclear power plant incident			0
" @entity1 's @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity343 contributed to this report			2

new : the @entity299 military is considering mandatory evacuations in @entity282 , an official says
high levels of radioactive iodine and cesium have been found in milk and spinach
