-- the family of @entity2 , who disappeared from @entity3 seven years ago , has long known he worked for the @entity4 -- a fact they once feared disclosing because the @entity8 government told them it could put @entity10 in even more jeopardy			1
now , they believe it could be the key to bringing him home			0
members of @entity10 's family offered the revelation in an interview with @entity0 on tuesday , in which they accused the @entity8 government of failing to do enough to find and free the missing @entity8 and prodded it to act before it 's too late			1
the family said it 's time for the government to lay out the facts about @entity10 's case			1
" i hope they are hearing our request that ( @entity8 government officials ) acknowledge what he was doing over there and they understand that the family does want this acknowledged now , " the missing man 's son , @entity24 , said			1
" and we think it would be more of a positive step to getting him home			1
" @entity8 officials have consistently denied publicly that @entity10 was working for the government			1
at the same time , they have repeatedly insisted finding him and bringing him home is a " top " priority			0
@entity42 : @entity10 not ' abandoned ' in @entity3 " we obviously stand with the family who are the ones who live with every single day that their husband or their father is n't home with them , " @entity44 spokeswoman @entity43 said			1
" so we are using every tool at our disposal to help bring him home to his family			0
we ca n't , obviously , talk about those			0
" @entity60 officials have said they believe any recognition @entity10 worked for the @entity8 government is counterproductive			1
while @entity3 has consistently denied knowing where @entity10 is , the family provided @entity0 with copies of documents they described as an arrest order and a memo saying @entity10 had been diagnosed with diabetes , was transferred to a hospital and had fallen into a coma			1
the family said they obtained the documents from a source in @entity3			2
they acknowledge they can not authenticate the documents , but the family said they were provided a translation by the @entity83 and have been told the names of the officials listed on the document are real			2
absent any other word about their missing loved one , it 's the closest they have to proof that he was arrested and could remain in @entity3 hands			2
but @entity3 minister of foreign affairs @entity95 wednesday said he had not seen the documents and repeated that the government has no knowledge of @entity10 's whereabouts			1
" i have not seen anything that could prove that he was ever in @entity3 , " he said wednesday in an exclusive interview with @entity0 's @entity101			2
" in fact , we have seen evidence ... he was last seen alive outside @entity3 , with pictures showing that he was outside @entity3 when he was last seen			0
it 's a very unfortunate case			0
we 've said clearly that we have no knowledge of his whereabouts ... we need the @entity8 to explain for @entity3 what a @entity4 operative was doing , if he was ever in @entity3 territory , what was he doing in @entity3 territory			1
" the @entity10 family said wednesday they " would be very happy to provide minister @entity95 with the documents as soon as possible , and any other information he may need so that @entity2 can safely return home to us			1
" @entity24 said the family believes getting his father 's work history out into the open gives them the best chance of reuniting with him once again			2
@entity2 , now 65 , had gone to @entity3 on a mission to investigate corruption involving @entity3 officials , according to an e-mail obtained by the family			1
@entity10 disappeared shortly after arriving and has not been heard from since a 2010 video			0
his situation gained renewed urgency in december , when @entity135 and the @entity136 reported that he was working as an independent @entity4 contractor when he disappeared			0
reports : missing @entity8 worked for @entity4 the @entity0 interview was the @entity10 family 's first since these news reports publicly revealed the retired @entity83 agent was working as a @entity4 contractor at the time of his disappearance			1
the family 's attorney , @entity146 , said documents show " without a shadow of a doubt " that @entity10 was a contract @entity4 operative who traveled extensively overseas recruiting and interviewing sources			1
one detail provided tuesday to @entity0 includes an e-mail the family said was sent by @entity10 to @entity4 officials discussing an investigation of @entity3 corruption and discussion over the cost of his work			1
" in connection with ongoing research i am conducting for an analytical report on the foreign investment of kickback and bribe monies of top @entity3 government officials , an individual with detailed knowledge of this subject , with whom i have been in contact by phone and e-mail over the past year , has agreed to meet with me , " the document reads			2
" this meeting will take place either in @entity181 or on an island nearby and should cost about two or three thousand dollars			0
" the family said the @entity4 at first lied to them about the trip			2
but after the family 's lawyer discovered documents , including e-mails between @entity10 and his handlers , the family said the @entity4 admitted @entity10 was working undercover in @entity3			1
eventually , three @entity4 employees -- including @entity10 's handler -- were fired and seven others disciplined in connection with the case			1
the @entity4 paid the family $ 2.5 million to avoid a lawsuit , @entity197 told @entity0			2
the @entity200 is still investigating the @entity4 with an eye toward possible obstruction charges involving allegations that officials lied to the @entity205 about @entity10 's status			1
the agency declined comment tuesday			0
@entity10 's wife , @entity10 , said the @entity83 is working the case hard , but the government overall should be doing more			1
" we thought that they would do the right thing and get him home as soon as possible , " she said			0
" unfortunately they have n't done anything , and this has been going on through two administrations , and nothing has gotten him home			0
and we do n't know why			0
" the missing man 's wife said the government should be using unspecified " intermediaries " to help negotiate a release			0
" we have asked them in the past , and unfortunately we have not been able to get any intermediaries over there to @entity3 to work on the case , " she said			0
" and now is the time for the @entity8 government to authorize someone to do this			2
" the government has been treating the disappearance as a criminal case more than one requiring negotiation to resolve , according to @entity197 , the @entity10 family 's lawyer			2
" this is something far beyond a criminal investigation , but there are people who have experience , who have the training , and who have the contacts and who have the history who can contact the @entity3 , who can deal with the @entity3 in good faith , who have the trust of the @entity3 who should be brought into this and they have not been brought in yet , " he said			0
" and that 's one of our frustrations			0
" who is @entity2 ? @entity10 's family hopes to return to @entity3 soon to press authorities to investigate the documents and provide more information			1
" the @entity3 have the documents , " @entity10 said			2
" they have done nothing with them			0
they have not told us anything since we gave them to them			0
we would like to do the investigation ourselves if they are not able to do it			0
" @entity95 told @entity0 , " if there is any hope or any use for this , @entity3 will consider it			0
" @entity10 's family said tuesday that they hope @entity3 's new president , @entity278 , will be more willing to help than his predecessor			1
" what better way could he show the world that he is all about human rights and wants to do humanitarian deeds by helping a normal @entity8 family who is not political , who is not who has no concern other than getting their father home , " @entity24 said			2
" he has the power to do that , he has the power to talk to these people , put us in touch with these people and find out what happened to my father and send him home			0
" @entity8 detained abroad @entity0 's @entity301 , @entity302 and @entity303 contributed to this report .			0
