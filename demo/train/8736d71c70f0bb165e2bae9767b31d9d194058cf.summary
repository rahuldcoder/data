-- how often do you see sports stars looking to the heavens in search of a little inspiration ? they might be on to something			0
that 's why the team hoping to build one of the fastest yachts on the planet is not looking to the water -- but to the sky			1
or to be more precise , the giant passenger plane flying overhead			0
@entity15 , the reigning @entity16 champions , have revealed their unlikely " secret weapon " in the hugely prestigious sailing race is @entity19			1
the aviation giant has partnered with billionaire businessman @entity22 's sailing team to create what it hopes will be an unbeatable high - tech yacht in the next edition of the race in 2017			1
but what does an airplane company know about boat design ? " if you look at it closer , sailing and flying share a common dna , " said @entity19 president and ceo , @entity32 © gie			1
" look at the importance of wind forces on airplane wings , and wind forces on the sails of a boat			2
and the speeds in aviation and boating share the same unit -- the knot			0
" planes on water indeed , gone are the days of heavy wooden yachts with single hulls and white billowing sails			2
today 's sleek carbon fiber multihulls are like airplanes on water , sitting high above the waves , with crew members wearing wetsuits , carrying oxygen tanks , and communicating via radio			1
and much like aircraft , these feats of design have rigid sails , rather than conventional material ones			2
with competing teams spending tens of millions of dollars on their @entity16 bids , @entity22 -- a software entrepreneur with an estimated fortune of $ 48 billion -- will also be digging into his deep pockets to create a state - of - the - art yacht			1
" the @entity16 is a boat race , but the design technology and engineering are very often the winning factor , " said team skipper @entity72 , who knows what he 's talking about -- he also has a pilot 's license			1
" they 're as much like airplanes as they are like traditional boats , so i know we 'll have a lot to learn from the engineers at @entity19			1
" @entity87 ? watching developments closely will be the @entity90 challengers -- led by four - time olympic gold medalist @entity91 -- who earlier this year launched their $ 134 million bid alongside their own secret weapon -- the @entity94 , @entity94			2
a keen sailor herself , the @entity95 went head - to - head against her husband @entity99 in a yacht race during their recent tour of @entity102 and @entity103 -- emerging victorious 2 - 0			2
it 's hoped she 'll not only pass on some of that winning spirit to @entity108 's team , but also add the type of international luster so attractive to the world 's richest investors			0
in the 163 year history of the race , @entity90 has never won the prestigious silver trophy			0
adding insult to injury , the first competition took place on its shores in 1851			0
where sky and sea meet back across the @entity124 , work has already begun collecting data on the @entity15 boat , with over 300 on - board sensors providing real time information to a main server			1
much like its planes , @entity19 will be analyzing the data closely			2
" when they get a brand new plane for the first time , they fly it and log hundreds and hundreds of variables , " explained @entity15 project manager , @entity131			0
" they are testing it and trying to improve the airplane			0
" and this is exactly the same when we launch our boat and go sailing for the first time			0
" perhaps @entity19 will also take away a thing or two from its new water - based collaboration			1
already , the company has introduced a ridged texture much like shark 's skin on its plane 's wings , to improve air flow			1
the worlds of flight and sail are not so dissimilar as they might seem			0
and somewhere between sky and sea , the next @entity16 will take place			0
insight : guts and glory -- 162 years of @entity16 design see : daredevil photographer captures ' perfect shot '			0

@entity19 partners with @entity15 to create high - tech yacht
part of @entity22 's *multimillion* dollar @entity16 bid
*modern* airplanes and yachts have similar rigid wings and sails
@entity19 also using shark - like skin on wings to improve air flow
