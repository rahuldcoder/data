-- scientists have unearthed a giant virus more than 30,000 years old from the frozen soil in a remote region of @entity5			1
while this ancient virus is harmless to people , the scientists behind the discovery warn that the discovery suggests that the thawing of permafrost in polar regions , as a result of either climate change or mining , could bring threats to human health			1
the ancient virus , named @entity19 , infects amoebas , not humans or animals			2
it survived in the @entity5 ice from a period when woolly mammoths and saber - tooth cats roamed the earth			1
the scientists found it in the @entity31 , the most northeasterly region of @entity32 , which lies across the @entity33 from @entity34			0
its discovery was reported by the researchers , from @entity39 and @entity32 institutions , in an article published this week by the @entity42 @entity41			1
@entity43 the discovery of @entity19 " shows how incomplete our understanding of microscopic biodiversity is when it comes to exploring new environments , " @entity39 's @entity44 ( @entity44 ) said			0
and the potentially bad news : the reemergence of other viruses " is no longer the domain of science fiction , " the center said			1
these include viruses that were long considered eradicated , such as smallpox , whose replication process is similar to that of @entity19 , according to the scientists			2
" this is an indication that viruses pathogenic for human or animals might also be preserved in old permafrost layers , including some that have caused planet - wide epidemics in the past , " said @entity63 , one of the study 's co-authors			0
far more genes scientists were previously aware of two distinct families of giant viruses , @entity79 and @entity80			2
this latest discovery establishes the existence of a third family			0
giant viruses contain far more genes than common viruses			0
@entity19 has about 500 genes , dwarfing viruses like those that cause @entity90 or influenza , which contain about 10 genes , according to @entity63			0
but @entity19 is in turn comfortably eclipsed by a previously discovered giant virus , @entity95 , which contains roughly 2,500 genes .			1

researchers find a giant virus that survived in the @entity5 permafrost
they name it *pithovirus* *sibericum* and says its harmless to people
but scientists warn the thawing of permafrost could bring threats to humans
the return of viruses like smallpox is no longer " science fiction , " a @entity39 institution says
