disgraced , imprisoned and facing money laundering charges in the @entity3 , former @entity1 president @entity0 is reigniting his defense			1
the leader of @entity1 from 2000 to 2004 , @entity0 has always denied the charges against him and now says the accusations are based on the lies of political enemies seeking revenge			1
" it is revenge that was organized and a result of a conspiracy among certain sectors , as much those in economic power in @entity1 as my enemies and ideological adversaries in the @entity3 , to get revenge against me and remove me from the political scene , " @entity0 said in an exclusive interview with @entity14 en @entity16 broadcast thursday morning			1
chain - link fences and barbed wire surrounded him as he spoke to the network from the courtyard of a @entity1 prison this week			2
in addition to airing his grievances with the media , @entity0 said earlier this month that he will file a complaint before the @entity35 , alleging that his rights have been violated by authorities			2
he alleges he was denied due process in his first extradition from @entity40 to @entity1 in 2008 and by a second extradition request by the @entity3			1
@entity0 said right - wing political adversaries in the @entity3 engineered the charges against him			1
" in the @entity3 it is a revenge of the richest group of the @entity3 right			0
they are charging me for being the only president who did not support with his signature nor with his permission the invasion in @entity51 , " @entity0 said			1
" so , i know that it is not only illegal			0
i know that it is eminently political , my detention in @entity1			0
" but @entity3 prosecutors have said it was @entity0 who abused the political system , accusing him of using his authority to launder and misappropriate millions of dollars intended for his country 's people			1
" @entity0 is charged with converting the office of the @entity1 presidency into his personal @entity67 , " @entity62 , @entity3 attorney for the @entity63 , said in a 2010 statement			1
" through various alleged embezzlement schemes , including one which involved $ 1.5 million intended for @entity1 school children , @entity0 abused the trust of his nation 's people			2
" an indictment unsealed in @entity77 federal court accuses @entity0 of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of public funds , " a substantial portion of which he laundered through @entity3 and @entity83 bank accounts			1
" after the @entity3 made an extradition request , @entity1 authorities arrested him on a farm on the country 's coast in 2010			1
@entity1 courts and the country 's president authorized his extradition to the @entity3 in 2011 , but the transfer has yet to take place			1
a @entity96 spokeswoman declined to comment on the status of the extradition case			1
@entity0 told @entity99 that he never laundered money in @entity3 banks			2
" if deposits were made , " he said , " they are deposits that first of all come from institutions that are not illicit			0
in order for there to be laundering , the first requirement is that the money is from an illegal origin or comes from an illegal activity			0
" @entity1 courts have previously acquitted @entity0 of embezzlement allegations -- something that @entity0 says shows that the @entity3 accusations against him are baseless			1
@entity0 responded directly to the charge concerning the $ 1.5 million that the @entity3 says was intended for school children			2
that money , @entity0 said , was something he had requested and received before he became president			2
from the beginning , that money was raised to create a trust fund to support his daughter 's studies , and that is what it was used for , @entity0 said			2
despite his claims that his rights have been violated during the extradition process , @entity0 said he believes he will get a fair trial in the @entity3			1
" i have confidence that at least i will have a transparent , impartial , objective trial that is based on reliable evidence and not just testimonies that are based on falsehoods , " he said			0
a fair trial would not be possible in @entity1 , he added			0
in the meantime , prison life has n't been too bad , the former president said			0
" i think pain and suffering make men better , make women better , make human beings better , " he said			0
in the three years he has spent in prison , he has read more than 100 books and seen more movies , he said			0
" i do n't regret anything			0
and i know this has some purpose			0
it will accomplish something in my life , " @entity0 said			0
" let @entity154 decide my destiny , and let history condemn or absolve me			0
