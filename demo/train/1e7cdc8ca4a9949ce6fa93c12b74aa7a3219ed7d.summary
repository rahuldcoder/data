@entity0 , @entity1 -- hardly a day has gone by this year without news coming from @entity1 of mass protests , labor strikes or violent attacks			1
in a country where strikes and protests are taboo , these are bold , desperate actions by @entity1 angry over low wages , land - grabs , abuse from officials , corruption , worsening pollution and other bread - and - butter issues			1
the @entity1 labor front has been particularly uneasy			2
on may 17 , more than 1,800 workers at a factory in southern @entity21 , which supplies parts for @entity23 , went on strike , demanding better pay			0
after a two - week standoff , they won			0
their victory has been contagious			0
walkouts have paralyzed several factories across @entity1 , including three other plants that supply auto parts to @entity23			2
@entity33 , a huge @entity34 - owned manufacturing group which produces parts for @entity36 , @entity37 and other companies , announced generous pay increases after a series of worker suicides this year put the spotlight on the plight of migrant @entity1 workers			1
@entity1 manufacturers face labor upheaval although @entity1 has emerged from the financial crisis stronger than most , it has not escaped economic and social disruptions			1
@entity1 is now grappling with a rise in social unrest , and the @entity1 leadership is taking it seriously			1
@entity53 , a top @entity54 official in charge of peace and order , acknowledges that " a wide range of social conflicts have occurred recently " and calls for " down - to - earth measures			2
" @entity33 firm seeks answers to rash of worker suicides speaking at a meeting in @entity0 , @entity53 said : " improving people 's livelihoods should be the starting and end point of all our work			0
people should be able to share the fruits of the reform and development			0
" but not everyone has			0
since @entity1 introduced market reforms in 1978 , economic growth has averaged more than 9 percent every year and per capita income has more than quadrupled			1
prospering the most are the booming coastal provinces , where shiny skyscrapers boast malls teeming with well - heeled shoppers			0
but in the rural interior , tens of millions of @entity1 still live in poverty			2
beneath the glowing statistics , @entity1 's leap to prosperity has left millions of its citizens behind			1
seeking a better life , millions of farmers have left the land to seek work in the cities			2
according to 2009 figures from the @entity97 there were almost 230 million migrant workers in @entity1			1
over the past three decades , they came in waves , working long hours in sweatshops , construction sites and assembly plants , enduring poor working conditions in order to save a little cash to remit home			1
they are the unsung heroes of the @entity1 economic miracle			2
but the second generation of @entity1 's migrant workers is a different breed			1
" their parents have lived through hardship and poverty , but the younger generation has seen nothing but economic growth and they feel they should benefit from the economic progress , " says @entity112 , political science professor at @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115			0
" they will not put up with poor working conditions , work - related stress and low wages			1
" officials are now trying to pacify them			0
without specifically commenting on the recent labor disputes , premier @entity129 urged better treatment for @entity1 's young migrant workers			1
speaking to a group of young workers at a subway construction site in @entity0 , he praised their work as " a glorious thing " and called on the government and society to " treat them as their own children			0
" @entity129 's soothing remarks may be taken as an indication of how seriously the leadership regards a restive population			2
" i think the government is very concerned about the unrest spreading and causing further disruptions , " says @entity147 , a @entity1 expert at the @entity148 in @entity149 " the workers ' uprising undermines the @entity54 's legitimacy to some degree and that is most worrisome to the leadership			1
the restrictions on reporting on strikes and workers ' dissatisfaction reflect that unease			0
" authorities have so far allowed workers at the @entity23 plants to organize and agitate for better pay , but workers say the police are keeping them under close watch			0
wary of the possible emergence of @entity174 - style independent trade unions in @entity1 , @entity1 's leaders are tightening controls in the political spheres as well			1
" the new regulations increasing oversight of foreign funding for @entity1 ngos is an example of how ubiquitous government oversight is , " says @entity177 of the @entity148			2
" one could argue that the government might be over-doing it to preempt turmoil , and in trying to exert complete control , it is eliminating checks and balances and other safety valves that allow the public to vent their frustration			0
" at the annual meeting of @entity1 's legislature in march , @entity129 had promised to address the issue of social justice and the yawning gap between the rich and the poor			1
shifting away from the growth - at - any - cost model that has prevailed over the past three decades , he promised more efforts on redressing the inequality and social tension that market reforms have engendered			1
one institution that is in place to help smooth labor disputes is the @entity208 ( @entity209 ) , an officially sanctioned labor union			0
@entity1 leaders have called on official labor unions to do a better job of representing workers			2
but striking workers at the @entity23 plant in southern @entity21 said they distrusted the official unions as pro-management , not pro-workers			0
instead of relying on the factory 's official union , each department elected two workers ' representatives who negotiated on their behalf the wage hike that they wished			0
analysts say the @entity209 now faces the choice of changing into a genuine workers ' union or remaining marginalized .			0

@entity1 's leadership are grappling with a rise in social unrest among the workforce
since market reforms introduced in 1978 , the leap to prosperity has left millions behind
migrant workers are *refusing* to put up with poor working conditions and low wages
@entity54 leadership worried *discontent* could spread , undermine its legitimacy
