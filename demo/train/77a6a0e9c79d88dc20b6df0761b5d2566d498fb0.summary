-- @entity1 , the seven - time @entity2 champion , suffered one of the most staggering defeats in the history of the tournament after being beaten by @entity8 's 116th ranked @entity9			1
the 27 - year - old fought back from losing the opening set 7 - 6 before winning 7 - 6 7 - 5 7 - 5 to mark the greatest triumph of his career and end @entity1 's record of making 36 consecutive grand slam quarterfinals			1
" right now i can definitely tell my grandkids , i kicked the butt of @entity1 , " @entity9 told reporters following his sensational victory			1
@entity9 , who reached a career high of 31 back in 2010 , held his nerve in the fourth set tiebreak to see off the defending champion and 17 - time grand slam winner			1
@entity1 was just one of seven former @entity27 players to lose their second round ties wednesday -- although his demise was by far the most dramatic			1
" i 'm very disappointed , " @entity1 told reporters			1
" losing at @entity2 always has been that way , will never change			2
so i 've just got to get over this one			0
some finals have n't hurt this much , that 's for sure			2
" it 's always a disappointment losing any match around the world , and particularly here			1
i 've had some great moments here , but also some tougher ones			0
" @entity1 's defeat leaves @entity43 as the only man in the draw to have won the tournament and also leaves the draw wide open for @entity49 's @entity48 , who progressed to the third round with ease			1
" i struggled maybe on the big points this time around again , like i have for some time this season , " @entity1 said of his clash with @entity9			1
but credit to him for closing it out under enormous pressure			0
he was better in the more important points today than i was			0
" i thought i had my opportunities , had the foot in the door			0
when i had the chance , i could n't do it			0
it 's very frustrating , very disappointing			2
" i 'm going to accept it and move forward from here			0
" @entity1 will now drop out of the top four for the first time since he won @entity2 in 2003 and could fall as low as @entity70 should @entity71 win this year 's title			1
but for @entity75 , the contrast in emotions could hardly be any greater			0
watched by his wife @entity76 , he produced the performance of his life on the court which @entity1 has virtually owned over the past decade			1
" i 'm still in disbelief that that happened , " @entity9 told the @entity80			2
" i was playing the best tennis i have ever played , i am incredibly happy			0
when you play @entity1 it 's like you 're playing two players			1
you play him the player and him the ego			0
i could n't play any better today			0
it was a fantastic day for me			0
" @entity1 's exit is his earliest at @entity2 since losing in the opening round to @entity94 in 2002 and his earliest at a grand slam since being beaten by @entity96 at the @entity97 in 2003			1
it is also the earliest defeat suffered by a defending champion since 2002 winner @entity101 was beaten by @entity102 in the first round the following year			1
@entity1 's loss means @entity48 will fancy his chances of making the final for the second year in succession			1
the @entity108 , who defeated @entity110 6 - 3 6 - 3 7 - 5 , will now play @entity112 's @entity111 in the third round			1
but despite @entity114 , @entity1 and @entity115 all falling by the wayside , @entity48 is refusing to look too far ahead			1
" there 's top players still left in the tournament , and there 's a lot of young guys as well coming through , guys like ( @entity126 ) @entity125 , ( @entity128 ) @entity127 , " he told reporters			2
" those sort of players are starting to break through and play more consistently			0
" i 'll just concentrate on my next match			0
i 'm playing a tough player , a very experienced guy			0
i 'll worry about that match			0
" @entity111 , who overcame @entity134 in four sets , says he will treat himself to cake and ice cream before turning his attention to the home favorite			2
" i have to congratulate myself because today i did a great job , " he told reporters			0
" so i 'm going to play @entity48 in two days			2
now i prefer to enjoy it , to relax , to go have a great dinner because i deserve it , with a chocolate cake with ice cream			0
then tomorrow is going to be a long day to think about @entity48			2
" elsewhere , former champion @entity101 was ousted in by @entity146 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 7 6 - 2 , while there were also wins for @entity112 's @entity148 , @entity150 's @entity149 and @entity152 's @entity151			1
@entity153 was forced to pull out of his tie with @entity155 's @entity125 after complaining of injury , while @entity157 and @entity158 were also big name casualties .			2
