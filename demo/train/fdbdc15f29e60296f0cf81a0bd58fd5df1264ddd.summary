-- a fully integrated @entity2 television , one of @entity5 ' final visions , might be on the way soon , according to multiple reports			1
in " @entity5 , " a biography of the late @entity2 co-founder released monday , author @entity8 writes that @entity5 told him he 'd finally figured out a way to make a tv practical			1
he said it would wirelessly synch with other @entity2 devices			0
" it will have the simplest user interface you could imagine , " he told @entity16			0
" i finally cracked it			0
" on the same day , analyst @entity21 of @entity22 issued a report titled " a full - blown @entity2 tv is on the way			1
" in it , he says the book confirms what his multiple trips to @entity28 have suggested			0
he said @entity30 has seen evidence that early stage prototypes of an " @entity33 " are already making their way through @entity28 factories			2
" we believe a product could hit the market in the coming quarters , opening up a new growth category for @entity2 and driving sales of existing products that play into the @entity2 digital ecosystem , " @entity21 wrote			0
on tuesday , @entity44 cited three unnamed sources saying that @entity46 , the software engineer who built @entity47 , is in charge of developing the television set			2
the news service quoted another analyst , @entity51 , of @entity52 , saying that the @entity55 's @entity54 voice - command app could be integrated into a tv system			0
since 2007 , the company has made a product called @entity59 , a set - top web - streaming box that competes with rival @entity61 and independent offerings like @entity64 and @entity65			1
but compared to hits like the @entity55 and @entity68 , it has largely underperformed , leading @entity5 last year to acknowledge that @entity59 has " never been a huge hit			1
" in september , @entity2 slashed its price from $ 299 to $ 99 , but even that has n't made the service a household name			2
in his report , @entity21 notes that a refresh of @entity59 set for later this year has been scrapped , potentially signaling the television system 's pending arrival .			1
