-- after dealing with porcupine creatures , shape - shifters and planes full of crystallized bodies over five seasons , star @entity6 is still having the time of his life on " fringe			1
" the cult favorite sci - fi series is in the midst of its final season on @entity14 , and classic episodes premiere tuesday night on the @entity16			1
@entity6 , who plays the brilliant ( and occasionally mad ) scientist @entity17 , recently spoke with @entity0 about his experience with the show and what fans can look forward to in the remaining episodes , leading up to a january 18 series finale			1
@entity0 : are you nearing the end of filming now ? @entity6 : my goodness , yes			1
we start filming our penultimate episode tuesday morning			1
we 're very close to the end , mate			1
@entity0 : and what 's that feeling like ? @entity6 : it just feels like an awful lot of work ( laughs )			1
we 've still got a bit to do			0
it 's an exciting thing feeling it all come together			1
there 's a sense of closeness among the crew			1
we 're here in @entity46 ; it 's our fourth year and , for the cast , our fifth year together			1
it 's a bit odd			1
we are friends , so it 's a bit sad			1
@entity0 : meanwhile , you 're getting a second life on the @entity16			0
@entity6 : the thing about @entity16 is that they know " @entity59 , " and they love it			1
the people i know there have watched from the beginning			0
it 's not just another product			1
they 've brought people in to talk about the science of it			0
we 're in a very good second home			0
@entity0 : this season , do you feel that @entity17 is bearing the weight of a tremendous amount of pressure to put together this plan to fight the @entity78 ? @entity6 : yes , but i think the pressure 's on everyone			1
all the key players have to come to some sort of conclusion , and that 's the gift of these last 13 episodes			2
every character is under pressure , if you can call it that			2
but it 's a good journey			2
every episode takes us further on the track to the finale			2
it 's like writing a novel and having the chance to write the final chapter			1
the stakes are lifted every week for us			0
it 's kind of exciting			2
@entity0 : we 've seen so many major twists just this season			0
what was your reaction to learning that @entity107 was going to utilize the tech of an @entity109 and sort of become one himself ? @entity6 : well , it 's pretty inspired , really			1
if you ca n't beat them , join them			0
@entity107 realized to combat these people , he would have to be on equal terms with them			0
it also gave @entity119 a marvelous journey , which i think he 's done splendidly			2
the fun thing is that both men are struggling with their arrogance and hubris in different ways			0
it 's a very interesting story arc to play as well			2
you have @entity17 not trying to be so smart and cruel , and @entity107 wanting to be more so			0
so that 's playing out really well			2
@entity0 : the show took a short break in shooting this season , as you had to take some time to take care of yourself			2
are you doing better now ? @entity6 : i 'm doing very well , mate			1
we decided we needed to address an ongoing issue , which been going on a long time for me , which is that i do n't sleep			2
ultimately , given the load of travel , i was starting to hit a wall			0
we did what we could to correct that			0
we probably really did n't need to take as much time as we did			0
the management was terrific and said , " get it sorted out			0
" we 're still going strong at this stage , so something worked			0
@entity0 : have you enjoyed discovering @entity149 ? @entity6 : i thought it was time i got with it			1
( @entity153 ) i resisted for so long			0
i have no idea , to be honest , what i 'm doing			0
i just go on every once in a while and say something , and it gets retweeted 6,000 times			0
it 's an astonishing way of communicating			2
thank @entity160 for that , because it takes away the tyranny of those who would withhold information			0
i remember i tweeted , " just saying g'bye to @entity166			0
lovely woman ! " i just had afternoon tea with @entity166 ( whose character died in a recent episode )			1
that was taken as , she 's gone forever			2
at that stage , she was still on the show , so i thought " what have i done ? " i knew she was gone ! you 've got ta be careful ! ( @entity153 ) @entity0 : @entity17 is famous for his love of junk food			1
do you have a favorite junk food on or off set ? @entity6 : to survive , i try not to eat junk food			1
i hate to destroy the myth ! on a film set , if you eat junk food , you 'd finish around 400 pounds at the end of the first season			1
that 's just the nature of the work			2
to destroy another myth , we do n't actually eat it , because we ca n't			0
in 40 takes , you 'd be absolutely bloated with @entity190 or whatever else you 're having			0
we go through the motions of it and then have to get rid of it to so we can do another take			0
there was a bacon sandwich i thought was rather nice ... @entity0 : and what can fans expect as it comes to a close ? @entity6 : i have n't read the final episode yet , but i know that ( executive producer ) @entity200 has put everything , and i mean everything , he 's got into this			1
he 's directing the last episode			1
i think it will be a masterpiece			0
i have n't read it , but i ca n't imagine anything less with the amount of heart he 's put into it			0
fingers crossed , but that 's my prediction			1
i think it will be a masterpiece .			0

@entity6 's cult show " @entity59 " is nearing the end of its run
@entity6 addressed his sleep *disorder* treatment , which *briefly* halted production
he 's not as much of a junk food fan as his character ; he recently discovered @entity149
@entity6 shared his prediction for the final episode : " a masterpiece "
