-- perfumes are typically named for flowers , jewels , seasons or feelings -- not long - range missiles			0
but residents of @entity8 can now buy a fragrance inspired by the rockets used in @entity12 ' recent conflict with @entity13			1
@entity8 company @entity14 is behind the perfume , called @entity16			1
" we have a marketing slogan which is ' whoever loves victory , happiness and dignity , loves the @entity16 perfume , ' " the company 's marketing director , who wished to be identified only as @entity29 , told @entity0 at the @entity17 in @entity20 's @entity19 neighborhood			1
" @entity16 in @entity8 means a period of happiness , or the feeling of victory , and the use of the perfume is an expression of happiness as well			1
" the @entity16 was one of the long - range missiles militants in @entity8 fired at @entity39 and @entity40 during the conflict last month , which ended after eight days with a cease - fire on november 21			2

@entity29 told @entity0 the " victory " provided an ideal marketing opportunity			0
he said the rocket was a local symbol of pride , used in much the same way a @entity62 company might use an image of the @entity64 to market their perfume			1
" in our case , it was the victory of the @entity46 that will make a profit for our company , " he said			2
@entity71 , an analyst at @entity72 , told @entity0 the @entity16 was named for one of @entity12 ' founders , @entity75 , and its designed range of 75 kilometers			1
although the rocket was essentially a reproduction of @entity80 technology , @entity12 had branded the rocket a @entity46 achievement to project an image of self - dependence and military strength			1
" by claiming to have produced the @entity16 itself , @entity12 is arguably trying to present itself as a force capable of producing its own weapons and not relying only on foreign powers as suppliers , " he said			2
the commander of @entity80 's elite @entity93 has publicly acknowledged supplying @entity12 with the knowledge to develop the @entity16 , a version of @entity80 's @entity97 missiles			1
