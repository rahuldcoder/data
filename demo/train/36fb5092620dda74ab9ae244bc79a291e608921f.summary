while i 'm sure even the @entity44 among you are aware of his biggest accomplishments ( defeating @entity47 comes to mind ) there are a lot of moments where @entity2 was pretty bloody awesome , and it 's totally been forgotten if you have n't recently done a re-read			1

) pretending to give @entity65 the @entity55 is one of the most amusing / clever / kind ( pick your adjectives ! ) friendship moments of the series			0
he let him think he gave him a magic liquid , and gave him confidence instead			0
) who among us did n't tear up when @entity87 and @entity2 make their tentative peace in " @entity89 " ? the fact that this scene did n't make the movie is a real shame			1

) he was the official secretary of @entity113 because , while he may have given her grief , he always supported @entity113 's initiatives			2

) @entity2 may have been moody during his fifth year , but it was also when he founded and ran @entity120			1
you know , just your everyday , run - of - the - mill , anti-ministry , pro-defense training ground			0
) he legitimately faced death pretty much every year ( including basically full - time when he was 17 ) , and he still regularly tried to save everyone			2
) he spared @entity131 's life because he did n't think his dad 's friends should be murderers , which is one of those incredible " this is who you really are , " character - defining moments that come around only a few times in your life			1
) after @entity65 left @entity113 and @entity2 in the forest during their outdoor trek when they 're 17 , @entity2 welcomed him back when he finally returns : no grudge - holding necessary			1

instead , while locked away in detention as @entity14 clenched the @entity202 , @entity2 realized he did n't care what @entity65 thought and kissed her during the victory party			2
) @entity210 : " remembered that i am not @entity206 , who forgave your insolence and insubordination ? you may wear that scar like a crown , @entity2 , but it is not up to a 17 - year - old boy to tell me how to do my job ! it 's time you learned some respect !
