i 'm an @entity1 and i despise @entity3 terrorists			1
in fact , despise is not even a strong enough word to convey my true feelings about those who kill innocent people in the name of @entity3			1
i hate them with every fiber of my being			0
i 'm not going to tell you , " @entity3 is a religion of peace			1
" nor will i tell you that @entity3 is a religion of violence			2
what i will say is that @entity3 is a religion that , like @entity21 and @entity22 , is intended to bring you closer to @entity24			2
and sadly we have seen people use the name of each of these @entity30 faiths to wage and justify violence			0
the unique problem for @entity33 is that our faith is being increasingly defined by the actions of a tiny group of morally bankrupt terrorists			1
just to be clear : the people who commit violence in the name of @entity3 are not @entity33 , they are murderers			1
their true religion is hatred and inhumanity			0
the only people terrorists speak for are themselves and the others involved in their despicable plot			0
they do not represent me , my family or any other muslim i know			0
and believe me , i know a lot of @entity33			2
we hate these terrorists more than non-muslims do			0
how can i say that ? because they harm innocent people in the name of our religion and consequently we suffer a backlash because of their acts			0
it can be anything from a spike in hate crimes to people viewing @entity33 as less than fully @entity68 because of our faith			1
we are the ones called to answer for the sins of people we detest			0
since the @entity73 bombing has renewed for some concerns about @entity33 , i wanted to candidly answer three questions i have been asked repeatedly over the years : 1			2
why do some @entity33 commit terrorism ? i 'm not a terrorism expert but i will share the view of those i have spoken to in the @entity1 community			1
there can be no doubt that some @entity33 wrongly believe that their terrorist act is sanctioned by @entity3			1
but to us their true motivation is not religious , but rather political			0
@entity3 is simply used by terrorists as a way to recruit @entity88 then engage in terrorism to bring attention to their grievances or to achieve their political agenda , just as other terror groups have done in the past			1
the recent statement of the @entity3 militant group in the @entity97 denying involvement in the @entity73 bombing makes this very point			1
they expressly tell us that they have a specific political agenda : " @entity104 are not fighting against the @entity68			2
we are at war with @entity106 , which is not only responsible for the occupation of the @entity97 , but also for heinous crimes against @entity33			2
why do n't @entity33 denounce terrorism ? just to be clear : @entity68 @entity33 and @entity68 @entity1 organizations have unequivocally denounced terror attacks			1
not just once , but over and over			0
but that does n't matter if you have n't heard it			1
and despite our best efforts to get this message out there , what attracts more media attention : a @entity1 denouncing terrorism or footage of an explosion ? does that mean that we will stop denouncing terrorism ? of course not			0
but we will have to be more creative in our efforts to attract media coverage to make this point to our fellow @entity68			2
why do n't @entity33 stop blowing stuff up ? i have never blown up anything , except maybe a model toy tank when i was a kid			1
nor has any other @entity33 i 've met in person or even on @entity135			2
but still we are charged by many with the task of policing a religion of more than a billion people			0
although this may not change some people 's perception , statistically @entity33 have not been the ones involved in most terror plots in the @entity68			1
in fact , since 1995 , 88 % of the domestic terrorist plots have been by right - wing groups , ecoterrorists and anarchists , according to an analysis by the @entity151			0
but still , 12 % were @entity33			2
believe me , we wish that number were zero			0
but here 's the brutal truth : neither law enforcement nor the @entity157 can stop every radical or criminal who happens to be @entity1			0
a " lone wolf " can devise his or her evil plan in secret , making detection almost impossible			0
as @entity170 sheriff @entity169 testified before @entity171 in 2011 , seven of the past 10 @entity168 plots in the @entity68 were foiled by tips from the @entity157			0
and just this past sunday , @entity174 commissioner @entity173 told @entity176 's @entity175 that his department has a strong working relationship with the @entity180 @entity1 community			0
and it 's not only @entity68 - @entity33 working with law enforcement to stop radicals , but @entity184 as well			1
just this week we saw an @entity3 terror plot prevented because of tips from the @entity184 - @entity1 community to law enforcement it is my hope that in time , @entity33 will not be defined to my fellow @entity68 by the handful of terrorists , but by the millions of others who are involved in all aspects of @entity68 life			1
well - known @entity68 @entity33 range from former @entity196 star @entity195 , tv personality @entity197 , @entity68 rep. @entity198 to police officers , teachers , judges , deli workers , cab drivers and the millions of @entity1 in between			1
these people , not the terrorists , are the true @entity33 .			1

@entity206 says " despise " is not strong enough to convey how much he hates terrorism
he says @entity3 is being wrongly defined by a tiny group of morally bankrupt terrorists
@entity68 @entity33 have denounced terror over and over , he says , but *public* has n't heard
terrorists are motivated by politics , he says . not one muslim he knows supports terror
