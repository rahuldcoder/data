@entity0 -- dr. @entity3 , found guilty monday of causing @entity5 's death , begins his new life as an inmate in a section of the @entity0 jail where high - profile prisoners are kept , a jail official said			1
while it is the " medical area " that houses inmates on suicide watch , @entity3 is only there because it has a higher ratio of guards , @entity12 's sgt. @entity11 said			2
@entity3 's defense team has vowed to appeal his involuntary manslaughter conviction , but first they must deal with his sentencing set for november 29			1
while @entity3 was " devastated " by the guilty verdict , he is " confident " he will win an appeal , defense lawyer @entity24 said			1
" what matters most right now is trying to keep dr. @entity3 from taking up a prison cell in this community , " lead defense lawyer @entity27 said			1
" that 's what we 're focusing on right now and we 'll deal with an appeal after that			2
" @entity3 served as @entity5 's personal physician as @entity5 prepared for his comeback concerts , with @entity3 giving him the surgical anesthetic propofol to help him sleep nearly every night for the last two months of his life , according to testimony			1
@entity5 's death on june 25 , 2009 , was caused by " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with two sedatives , the @entity0 coroner ruled			1
the verdict followed about nine hours of jury deliberations , which began friday morning in the downtown @entity0 courthouse			0
@entity3 could be sentenced to as much as four years in a state prison , but his lawyers will ask for probation and " maybe a little bit " of time in the county jail , @entity24 said			1
a new @entity57 law aimed at reducing state prison overcrowding and a federal court order addressing county jail overcrowding could combine to significantly reduce @entity3 's time behind bars			1
if @entity3 's conviction is treated as a non-violent felony he could be kept in the county jail , where he could be eligible to serve some of his time at home under monitored house arrest			1
@entity70 judge @entity69 , who will decide @entity3 's sentence , made it clear when he denied bail monday that he considered the doctor a threat to public safety			1
" this is not a crime involving a mistake of judgment , " @entity69 said			0
" this was a crime where the end result was the death of a human being			0
" both @entity85 and @entity24 said the defense was not surprised by the guilty verdict			0
" i think what went wrong was a lot of the pretrial rulings that were made by the court in reference to some of the evidence that we planned to offer for the jury to consider , " @entity24 told @entity1 's @entity88			2
" i think that 's essentially what denied dr. @entity3 a fair trial in this case			2
" the outcome may have been different had the defense been able to introduce additional evidence -- like on @entity5 's past drug use and " financial condition , " @entity24 said			1
@entity69 's rulings to limit the defense case could be the basis for an appeal , he said			1
@entity3 appeared to show no emotion as the verdict was read by court clerk @entity114 monday afternoon or even as deputies handcuffed him and led him away			2
a loud celebration erupted among @entity5 fans outside of the courthouse , where emotions ran so high at least one woman fainted			0
passing cars honked their horns , as people nearby hugged , cried and yelled out in joy			0
@entity5 's family , including by his parents and several of his brothers and sisters , smiled as they left the courthouse			1
an emotional @entity130 on monday thanked all those involved in the trial , calling the decision a " victory			0
" " everybody was wonderful , " @entity130 told @entity136 's @entity135 as she left the @entity0 courthouse			0
a statement released by @entity5 's estate monday said that " justice has been served			2
" deputy district attorney @entity142 personally expressed his sympathies to the @entity5 family who he said lost " not a pop icon , but a son and brother			0
" @entity0 district attorney @entity148 thanked jurors " for their hard work and thoughtful deliberation , " and expressed gratitude that they recognized the " overwhelming " evidence against @entity3 in finding him guilty			0
the seven men and five women on the jury heard 49 witnesses over 23 days , including @entity3 's girlfriends and patients , @entity5 's former employees , investigators and medical experts for each side			1
defense lawyers contended the matter was a negligence case that should instead be heard by the state medical board			0
" if it were anybody else but @entity5 , would this doctor be here today ? " @entity85 asked in his closing			0
jurors were left to decide if the propofol overdose was infused into @entity5 's blood by a steady intravenous drip , as the prosecution contended , or if @entity5 injected himself using a syringe left nearby by @entity3 , as the defense argued			1
" he was just a little fish in a big , dirty pond , " @entity85 said , pointing the finger at other doctors who treated @entity5 , and @entity5 himself			0
prosecutor @entity142 attacked the defense for trying to blame " everybody but @entity3 , poor @entity3			2
" @entity142 painted @entity3 as a selfish doctor who agreed to take $ 150,000 a month to give @entity5 nightly infusions of propofol in his home , something prosecutors argued an ethical doctor would never do because of the dangers			2
" it was a very strong and powerful message that this sort of conduct does rise to the level of criminal negligence , and to the extent someone dies as a result of them playing the role of dr. @entity203 , they will be held accountable , " @entity191 said after the verdict			0
@entity3 's license to practice medicine is now suspended , according to the @entity206 , which decides if a doctor can legally work in the state			2
in the light of the conviction , the board now will open an investigation to determine whether or not to fully revoke @entity3 's right to practice medicine in the state , spokeswoman @entity209 said			1
the main criteria in deciding whether to revoke , suspend or take other action against any doctor is assessing how substantial a crime is related to the practice of medicine			0
there is no timeline as to when the board might act regarding @entity3 , said @entity209			0
@entity1 's @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
