-- for several weeks , @entity1 had been telling her 2 - year - old son @entity2 the following : " @entity3 and @entity4 are going to go to work for a while ... but we always come back for you			1
" we always come back for you			2
" @entity2 is too young to understand that his mommy and daddy 's " work " involves deploying to @entity11 just around the new year , and that " a while " could be between six and 12 months			1
but there are signs he seems to grasp how his life is about to dramatically change , @entity1 said			1
when she said goodbye to him at the airport , which would be the last time she 'd see him in person for months , he wanted to come along and said , " @entity21 ? " @entity1 , who did n't want to cry in front of @entity2 for fear of making it even harder on him , could n't hold back the tears			1
" i started crying and told him that i wish he could come to work with me , but that i would come back to him like i always do as soon as i could			2
" " i said , ' i always come back for you			0
' " then , fearing she was really going to lose it , she gave him lots of kisses , hugged him for a " very long time " and walked away as fast as she could			1
" it 's really rough , i 'm not gon na lie , " she said in those first days after their goodbye			1
i ca n't even imagine how rough			0
the most i 've been away from my girls , ages 6 and 7 , was 2Â½ weeks			1
the only people who perhaps can truly understand how rough it will be are the small group of military couples who have been deployed at the same time			1
from 2011 to the present , 681 @entity44 couples had simultaneous deployments , according to the @entity47 for the @entity44			1
' man , this is going to be hard ' the @entity44 did not order the @entity50 to deploy together			1
@entity1 , a @entity44 combat correspondent , volunteered with her husband 's full support because she has not deployed to @entity53 or @entity11 during her six years in the military and always wanted to experience a deployment			1
her husband 's enlistment was about to end after 10 years , so he would remain home with @entity2 while she deployed			1
but then her husband , a @entity44 sergeant who is a program manager with infantry detection dogs and a clerk with the @entity63 unit , was offered a deployment that would give him a chance for a promotion to staff sergeant			1
@entity1 encouraged her husband , @entity68 , whom she calls @entity69 , to take it , even though it would mean both would be away from @entity2 at the same time			1
read @entity73 : husband wife deploying together " he 's always been there for me			2
he 's always encouraged me to do more and grow , " she said			0
" i said this is kind of a sign			0
' hey , it 's not time for you to go just yet			2
you still have a little more work in the @entity44			1
' " since making that decision , they have tried not to dwell on how tough it will be for @entity2 and for them , but of course , that is much easier said than done			0
" i said , ' at least we 'll be together , ' " said @entity1 , who will be deployed to the same base as her husband in southwestern @entity11			1
" other than that , it was just a whole lot of , ' man , this is going to be hard , ' especially when ( @entity2 would ) come into bed with us in the morning			0
he 's still sleepy but he climbs on in and he 's just all happy and cuddly and it 's just , ' man , i 'm really going to ... this is going to suck			2
' " ' i 've heard that i 'm a bad mom ... for leaving ' her mom and dad , who live outside @entity105 , agreed to watch @entity2 while she and her husband are overseas , so they moved him from @entity107 to @entity108 shortly before @entity109 to help him adjust to a new routine			1
she then had to return to work in @entity112 in early december , and her husband a few weeks later			2
they 'll be spending @entity114 away from @entity2 before departing to @entity11			1
@entity1 's family has been extremely supportive , but not everyone understands their decision , especially since it was their choice			1
" i 've heard that i 'm a bad mom and a bad wife for leaving , especially when we did n't know @entity69 was going to be going			1
i heard a lot of , ' how could you leave your son like that ? ' " she said			2
" sometimes , people who find out that both of us are deploying , they kind of say backhanded comments like , ' wow , you guys are so brave for leaving your son			0
i could never do that			0
' and , ' you know , i try to be so centered around my kids			0
' and it 's like , ' ok , well , me , too , but this is my job			0
' " it 's hard to know if those same people who seem to be passing judgment , even if they are doing it in a less than direct way , would have been more understanding a few years ago when there were two wars going on at the same time , the conflicts in @entity53 and @entity11 , and both were getting more attention here at home			1
but regardless of the answer to that question , the fact that some people do n't seem to appreciate @entity1 and @entity69 's service and the extraordinary sacrifice they will be making is n't lost on them , especially on @entity154			1
" it hurts , but my husband is very , very good about focusing on the positives , because i am very good at focusing on the negatives , " she said with a laugh , remembering a wacky time recently when @entity2 was cracking up during a family silly string fight			1
" after everything had kind of settled down , ( @entity69 ) was like , ' see he 's going to remember the good times and he thinks , this is good , and he 's not going to say , ' well , i ca n't believe you left me when i was 2			0
he 's going to remember the good			0
' " ' he can still have me close ' @entity1 plans to take " quite a few pictures " of @entity2 with her along with all the pictures she already has on her @entity169			1
plus , she 's bringing a special bear she and @entity69 got when she was 22 weeks pregnant with @entity2			0
" we had gone to a @entity174 ultrasound place , and they recorded his heartbeat and put it inside the bear so i 'll be taking that with me , " she said			0
she and @entity69 are also leaving plenty behind for @entity2 , including their bed and some of their clothes so that he can just " hang out with mom and dad 's scent			2
" they 've been taking pictures of just about everything they do so @entity2 will have them on the computer			2
her mom also plans to have some pictures printed on little pillowcases and to hang a canvas of pictures in his room			2
" i ( plan ) on writing him because he 's very , very smart , " she said			0
" he likes to be read to , so i wanted to write him letters so that my mom can read them to him and he understands that mom 's far away but ... he can still have me close			2
" leaving a son : ' ok , how do i prepare for that ? ' she feels mentally ready for her deployment , especially after a series of classes the military provides to give a better understanding of what she might encounter in @entity11			1
but it 's pretty much impossible to know how to prepare for being away from her son , she told me			0
" i 'm just like , ' ok , how do i prepare for that ? how do i ? ' " she said			2
" i do n't know how to handle that			0
" watch : saying goodbye to a college - bound daughter she has a friend who has two boys and recently returned from a deployment , and plans to reach out to get an understanding of how she coped with being apart			1
still , she continues to have moments where she wonders if she 'll really be able to do this			0
it was especially hard after some recent family outings to the park and @entity231			0
" then it 's like , ' man , how can i leave this ? ' " she said			0
a few minutes later , she said , the doubts go away			0
" we 're going to do this and we know it 's not going to be that bad and we 'll all be better for it , ' " she said			2
she and @entity69 , who has been to @entity53 twice , are aware of the dangers , but try not to dwell on them			0
instead , they focus on the future , especially their homecoming			0
" all i can think about is coming back and seeing him at the airport when i fly back , " she said			0
" i keep thinking about how i 'll try to be as polite as possible , but i 'll probably be running people over just to get to him			0
" and who could blame her ? follow @entity250 on @entity251 , and like @entity252 on @entity253 .			0

@entity1 and her husband will be deployed to @entity11 at the same time
the @entity257 join the roughly 681 @entity44 couples who have deployed at the same time since 2011
" i 've heard that i 'm a bad mom , " said @entity1 , *referring* to some *criticism* she has received
what will get her through her 6 - to 12 - month deployment ? thoughts of her *reunion* , she said
