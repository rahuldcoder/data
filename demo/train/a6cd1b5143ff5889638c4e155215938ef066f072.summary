@entity1 , @entity0 -- there are many superficial similarities between the worlds of the military and business , something captain @entity9 of the @entity10 knew only too well			1
@entity11 @entity10 on an operation in @entity13			1
@entity9 was one of the instigators of the so - called @entity15 , an innovative cooperation between the @entity10 ' @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , and the @entity21 's top - rated @entity20			1
the outdoor - based course , intended to show @entity20 students how @entity10 - style leadership principles and teamwork can help in business , has proved enormously popular			1
tragically , @entity9 can no longer appreciate the success of his initiative -- a year ago , while serving in @entity13 he was killed by a sniper 's bullet in @entity32 province , in the west of the country			1
@entity20 has decided to give something back in appreciation of @entity9 and has just announced a new scholarship in his honor			1
the captain @entity39 will allow one @entity10 officer per year take a @entity20 executive education course , something that would normally cost many thousands of dollars			1
@entity9 's parents attended the ceremony where officials announced the new scholarship			2
" we are proud that he did such a good job and that he will be remembered , " said his mother , @entity46			0
more than 1,000 @entity50 students have taken part in the @entity15 since it was set up eight years ago			0
such is the program 's popularity that each year more than 500 students apply for the 180 spaces available			0
" our partnership with the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) and @entity17 has greatly benefited our students and the @entity10 , with @entity10 officers participating every year in our leadership conference " said @entity56 , director of the @entity57			2
" to say that the investment both @entity63 and the @entity10 have made in our students is unparalleled would be an understatement			2
" the courts focuses on the @entity10 ' " values of honor , courage , and commitment , " said @entity56			0
" @entity71 , we say , is about making a difference , and we 're proud to honor @entity63 and the @entity10 for making a difference with our students and in the world			0
" while @entity9 's links with the business education world were closer than most , his contribution in combining the military and commercial worlds is not unique			2
for example , the @entity81 's @entity80 has recently begun running a specialist mba for senior military officers in association with the @entity81 military 's own leadership college			0
closer to @entity9 , fellow @entity88 captain @entity88 - who attended the announcement about the new scholarship - mused on the subject in @entity20 's @entity93 journal			1
until recently , he admitted , " i thought the @entity10 had cornered the market on leadership [ and ] any leadership civilians did was merely ' management '			0
" he added : " but as i began to encounter more academic and business professionals through my teaching work , i became more introspective , reevaluating my own leadership style			0
