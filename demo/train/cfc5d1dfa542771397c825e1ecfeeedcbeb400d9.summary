-- " i love @entity2 , and i do n't even know her last name , " legendary golfer @entity0 was once memorably quoted when asked about the venue for this week 's @entity6			1
" @entity0 " had good cause for his admiration of the famous inland links near @entity10 , having won the 1971 edition of the tournament after a playoff with @entity14 , no less			1
@entity14 , who went on to win a record 18 major titles , described @entity2 's championship @entity17 as " acre for acre , maybe the best test of golf in the world			1
" current no. 1 @entity23 is another big fan			2
" you have to be so disciplined to play that course , " he said after a recent practice round			2
so what is it about the @entity2 which evokes such praise -- and what will await @entity31 and his rivals when they bid for major glory this week ? thursday 's opening round was disrupted by the arrival of predicted bad weather , but there is much more at the @entity40 venue to challenge the world 's top golfers			1
@entity1 's @entity43 has gone behind the scenes at the iconic venue to provide the definitive guide to the magic of @entity2 and all its charms			1
wicker wonders foremost among them are the famous red wicker baskets which are positioned above the pin sticks in place of conventional flags -- a peculiarity these days , though more common earlier in the history of golf			1
they first appeared at @entity2 in 1915 , three years after the course opened in september 1912			2
the historical origins of the baskets and indeed the reason for them remain unclear , but by the time the 1916 @entity64 @entity63 was hosted -- the first major event on the course -- they were still in place and have remained ever since			2
the green staff even have a special machine into which each individual wicker basket flag can be gathered up each night in the " wicker cart			1
" when a move to replace " the wickers " with standardized flags was mooted , the outcry was loud and clear			1
but , according to @entity0 , they add to the challenge facing the golfers , particularly in breezy conditions			2
" generally when we stand out in the middle of the fairway we can see which way the flag is blowing so we have some idea of how to play the wind , " he told @entity1			0
" but with the wicker baskets , no ! " whoever emerges the winner this sunday evening will be presented with a wicker basket to commemorate their win along with the championship trophy			1
one - iron wonder in 1950 , the legendary @entity64 golfer @entity95 won the @entity6 at @entity2 -- just 16 months after suffering terrible injuries in an automobile crash which nearly claimed his life			1
by a curious twist , and for the only time , the wicker baskets were not used that year			1
perhaps they did not want to upset @entity95 -- who had the unfair reputation of being a ruthless and aloof winning machine -- on his courageous comeback trail			0
so when he came to play his second shot to the testing par - four 18th in the final round , he would have seen a flag blowing in the far distance over 200 yards away			0
struggling with pain from his still - healing injuries and knowing he needed to find the small green with his shot to have any real chance of joining two other golfers in a playoff , @entity95 selected a one - iron club -- which hits the ball far and low if hit correctly			0
ever the perfectionist , @entity95 's strike was pure perfection and brought gasps from the galleries as it arrowed its way to the heart of the green			0
two putts for a par were enough and he won the next day 's 18 - hole playoff against @entity129 and @entity130			1
the drama of the moment was captured for posterity by famous @entity134 and @entity136 photographer @entity135			1
it is rated one of the best sports photos of the 20th century			0
that club used by @entity95 now resides in the @entity140 as one of its prized exhibits			0
iconic winners @entity95 would be near the top of any list of all - time great golfers , but call it coincidence , the best of the best have filled the honors board at @entity2			0
the 1916 @entity151 was the first tournament for a 14 - year - old @entity152			0
he returned in 1924 to win the event , but his victory in 1930 is best remembered			0
in the days before the @entity64 masters and @entity157 , the majors were considered to be the @entity64 and @entity158 and the @entity159 and @entity160			0
@entity152 , the dominant golfer of his era , amateur or professional , arrived at @entity2 in september 1930 needing to win the @entity151 to complete the set in the same calendar year			0
in the 36 - hole final , played to a matchplay format , he thrashed his unfortunate opponent @entity167 , watched by a massive crowd			0
a reporter labeled the feat as the " @entity171 " -- a term which has stuck			0
it was to prove @entity152 ' final tournament as he retired from competition aged just 28 to practice law , although he was the driving force behind founding the masters at @entity179			0
@entity181 won the first @entity6 to be staged at @entity2 in 1934 , @entity95 's 1950 heroics have gone down in golfing folklore , while @entity14 famously led the @entity64 to victory there in the @entity185 ( the @entity186 ) in 1960			1
his four - round total of 269 is considered one of the greatest displays in the history of the game , but when @entity14 returned to @entity2 for the @entity6 at the peak of his powers in 1971 he found @entity0 barring his way to victory			1
they both tied in 280 level par after four rounds on a course @entity0 described as holding " a lot of trouble and with a lot of tall grass			0
" few gave him much chance in the playoff , but with a round of 68 to @entity14 ' 71 he claimed his second @entity6 and his words " had beaten the best " giving him the belief he " really belonged " in very elite of golf			1
@entity211 claimed the fourth staging of @entity6 at @entity2 in 1980 and was in awe of his place in golfing history , becoming the first @entity216 to win the tournament			1
" @entity152 won there , @entity0 , @entity95 won there and then this little kid from @entity216 comes along and wins , " he told @entity1			2
@entity95 phoned him after his victory and they had lunch			0
" he liked international players , he congratulated me on winning			2
it was cool , " @entity211 said			0
anyone for cricket coming from @entity216 , @entity211 would acknowledge that while golf is a popular sport , cricket is a national obsession as it is in @entity232 -- the two battling for supremacy for the famous @entity234			1
when the original @entity2 club was founded in 1865 -- a playground for the rich society elite of @entity10 -- the @entity159 influence was still strong , so cricket was the chosen sport for the country club setting , while tennis also became popular			1
in 1896 , a golf club was formed from the membership and a course built on existing grounds			2
the @entity17 came later -- completed in 1912 and built on land acquired near @entity248			1
it was designed by one of the club 's members , scotsman @entity250 -- who had never done such a job before			0
@entity256 roots he went back home to find inspiration from @entity256 's famous coastal links courses , and it was he who introduced the wicker baskets			1
@entity264 , near the border of @entity232 , has a strong resemblance to @entity2 , particularly the 15th and 17th holes			2
the style of the bunkers is also different from that commonly found in the @entity64 and according to @entity0 are devilishly difficult			0
they are nicknamed the " white faces of @entity2 " and with good reason			0
" the @entity256 - type bunkers are unbelievable because you think you might be in the bunker , then all of a sudden you 're in the lip of it and you ca n't find your ball , i mean it 's hiding in there ! " @entity0 told @entity1			1
@entity0 believes that despite its short length by modern standards , the combination of the bunkers , small greens and forbidding rough will leave @entity23 and co. with a very real test			0
" that 'll be the toughest little 7,000 - yard golf course you 'll ever see			2
" lunch tee one of other challenges facing the players will be the unusually close proximity of the dining patio to the first tee			2
nerves jangling at the start of an important round , the players can almost hear the tinkle of cutlery and glasses as the members tuck in to some fine cuisine			1
" it almost feels like you 're teeing off in a carport because the first tee is just outside the door there , " @entity0 said			0
" that 's the way all the courses used to be			2
if you go over to @entity256 and if you shank a ball out of a bunker , then you 'll break the biggest window in the world in a dining room			1
" that 's the way they built it -- they had a lot of property , they did n't waste it			0
now you 're building golf courses on 500 acres and nine holes covers five miles ! " @entity2 , hosting the @entity6 for the fifth time , takes up a mere 120 acres			1
all about tradition as @entity0 and others have suggested , it is a course absolutely dripping with traditional influence and none more so than the clubhouse , which was once a farmhouse			2
players will use a changing room full of big metal lockers and period features			2
photos and old scorecards adorn the walls and there is a massive trophy case -- appropriate for a club which has hosted more @entity347 events , 18 in all , than any other in the @entity64			0
the last was the @entity350 amateur competition , where the likes of @entity352 helped the @entity64 to victory over @entity354 and @entity355			0
once on the course , players and caddies will have to do without yardage markers , while golf carts are prohibited even for members			1
@entity211 has nothing but praise for the work of the club in preserving its culture and heritage			0
" they 've done such a superb job with their museum , they 're very cognizant of the club 's tradition and they do what @entity376 does			0
at all costs they protect the integrity of the club , " the 67 - year - old said			0
" certain ( @entity64 ) opens , like the one at @entity384 , is a little special and certainly the @entity6 at @entity2 was special , especially for me			1
" doubtless , whoever writes their name into the roll of honor under 2012 @entity6 champion @entity390 will take away similar thoughts and join a list of special greats .			1
