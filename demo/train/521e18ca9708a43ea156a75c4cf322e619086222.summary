@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's leader plans to speak saturday about the indictment of four party members in the assassination six years ago of @entity8 , @entity1 's former prime minister			1
the group 's press office said @entity11 plans to make remarks about the @entity14 - backed @entity13 , which issued indictments and arrest warrants this week in the february 14 , 2005 killing of @entity8 and 22 others			1
@entity4 is a @entity19 political faction in @entity1 that provides social services to its constituents , but it has long been regarded as a terrorist organization by the @entity23 and as an ally of @entity25			2
it has had longstanding animosity toward the tribunal , based on the expectation that some of its members would be indicted as conspirators in @entity8 's assassination , and @entity11 has accused the group 's arch - enemy @entity35 of the assassination			1
the tribunal submitted to @entity1 authorities a sealed indictment and arrest warrants for an unknown number of suspects			0
a highly - placed source in the @entity44 told @entity2 the four include @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 -- all @entity4 members			1
@entity46 -- who is the brother - in - law of @entity51 , a former @entity4 commander who was assassinated in @entity52 in 2008 -- is reported to be a member of @entity4 's advisory council			1
a @entity14 source familiar with the tribunal said the people indicted include alleged perpetrators on the ground			2
two additional lists of indictments are expected later this summer and are expected to include the organizers and planners of the attack , the @entity14 source said			0
an indictment had been submitted in january and was then amended three times			0
@entity71 , a pre-trial judge with the tribunal , " ruled that the indictment shall remain confidential to help @entity1 authorities in fulfilling their obligations to arrest the accused , " the tribunal said			0
it wo n't comment on the identity anyone named in the indictment			0
authorities in @entity1 will have to report to the tribunal within 30 days on the measures they have taken to try to arrest the accused			0
many @entity1 believe the killing revolved around the controversies over @entity52 's role in @entity1 , occupied at the time by @entity52 troops , and the @entity89 government 's strong political influence in @entity1			2
people believe @entity8 wanted the @entity52 to withdraw from @entity1 and lessen @entity52 's influence , and many suspect that @entity52 and its ally @entity4 went after @entity8 because of his stance on this issue			1
those suspected connections of @entity4 and the @entity52 government to the killing have raised tensions in the country , stoking fears of sectarian conflict erupting in the ethnically and religiously diverse nation , which endured a civil war from 1975 to 1990			1
@entity52 had thousands of troops in @entity1 and great influence in the country until mass protests after @entity8 's assassination known as the @entity110 forced their withdrawal			1
@entity52 has denied any involvement in the assassination			2
another was result of the anger toward the attack was the creation of the tribunal			0
the @entity14 and the @entity1 negotiated an agreement on the establishment of the body , based in the @entity122			0
@entity2 's @entity123 contributed to this report			0

@entity11 has *blamed* the killing on @entity35
@entity8 's killing *sparked* outrage toward @entity52
