@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity3 's one - time prime minister , may get a second chance at the job			1
after serving as the country 's leader from 2006 to 2007 , his @entity6 looks set to return to power this weekend in national elections			0
some investors believe the second coming of @entity2 will be good for @entity3 's equity markets			1
" investors are pricing in ... much greater monetary easing , " said @entity14 , head of @entity3 equities at @entity16 in @entity0			1
in mid-november , @entity2 called for unlimited monetary easing to jumpstart the economy			1
he also urged the @entity21 to raise its current 1 % inflation goal to as much as 3 %			0
since then , investors betting on an @entity2 administration have pushed the @entity25 up by more than 10 %			0
still , @entity14 doubts if @entity2 can deliver on his calls for more stimulus and thinks investors might not see action			1
" that 's just talk to get into office			0
he 's putting a line in the sand			0
i do n't know how he achieves it			0
" if anything , @entity14 believes @entity2 's timing is " quite fortuitous " and that @entity3 's economy has " hit bottom " and is ready to bounce back			1
and if @entity2 returns to office , he is expected to push back harder against a rising @entity41 than his predecessors , if his previous assertive leadership style is anything to go by			1
@entity46 's first and second largest economies have been embroiled in a months - long trade dispute because of rival territorial claims in the @entity49			0
both @entity41 and @entity3 lay claim to a small grouping of islands , known as the @entity53 in @entity41 and the @entity53 in @entity3			2
on september 11 , @entity3 nationalized the islands causing an uproar in @entity41			2
in retaliation , @entity41 consumers slowed their purchases of @entity3 products			2
in october , @entity3 revealed its september exports to @entity41 fell more than 14 %			2
a stronger stance against @entity41 may rattle trade ties even more , @entity14 said			2
and that may also weaken @entity3 's currency , the yen			0
" in fact , @entity2 's comments may be intentionally aimed at destabilizing sentiment on the yen , " @entity14 added , noting that " anything that removes popularity of the yen as a safe haven " will be good for exporters			1
@entity3 's economy relies heavily on exporters -- big - name brands that include well - known names @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
a weaker currency means @entity3 's exporters earn more yen when they repatriate overseas profits back to @entity3			1
since mid-november , the yen has weakened 5.2 % as @entity2 's chances of returning to power have risen			1
still , while many economists are becoming more bearish about @entity3 's economy , which has just slipped into recession , @entity14 remains bullish			1
" @entity3 has never looked better to me			0
i 'm very , very optimistic on it , " @entity14 said			0
" i 'm hopeful for the market and the economy and @entity2 's timing is solid			2
" " he 'll initiate a cycle of new industrial development -- a rebirth of heavy industry in @entity3 that includes energy , hi - tech , space exploration and defense industries			0

some investors believe second coming of @entity2 will be good for @entity3 equity markets

@entity2 expected to push back harder against @entity41 than his predecessors
