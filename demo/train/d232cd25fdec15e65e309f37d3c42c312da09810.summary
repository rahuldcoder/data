-- while @entity2 continues to pathetically assert that he is a modern day dr. @entity3 and his listeners and viewers are the rightful heirs to the @entity7 he spearheaded , it may catch some by surprise that @entity10 leaders claim their movement is also one that is about advancing the civil rights of @entity13			1
during a debate i participated in wednesday night on @entity0 's @entity19 360 , @entity15 spokesman @entity14 -- who moonlights as a radio talk show host -- blasted the @entity20 for the @entity21 for not doing anything to fight crime in the inner city , as well as for advancing issues that go against the @entity27 @entity26			1
i had to do everything i could to maintain my composure , considering that the @entity31 's long and storied history has been about forcing @entity13 to actually uphold the @entity26 and apply it evenly to all citizens , especially @entity13			1
yet as @entity14 continued his tirade , i really did want to hear exactly what civil rights issues he and other @entity10 members are fighting for			1
i 'm sure they would come as a surprise to civil rights organizations , the folks who are on the frontlines every day			1
i asked @entity14 if he would be willing to sit down and meet with the @entity31 , the @entity42 , the @entity43 and other civil rights organizations to find common ground on various civil rights issues			1
his response ? attend the more than 70 @entity10 rallies in the fall as a participant			2
so with my suggestion in mind , it would be great for @entity14 , @entity54 and other @entity10 leaders , advocates and supporters , especially those candidates receiving their backing in november , to clearly state their position on some of the civil rights issues of the day ( the following are not in a particular order of importance )			1
president @entity64 and the @entity66 establishment are against the notion of school vouchers			0
@entity69 have advanced the issue for years , yet in @entity72 it was @entity69 members who could have made the difference in vouchers being offered to students who attend schools that rank at the bottom in @entity79			0
state sen. @entity80 ( who also is founder / senior pastor of @entity81 of @entity79 , @entity72 , where i 'm a member ) , fought hard to pass the measure			0
he was rebuffed by a lot of folks in the @entity66 , but also a number of @entity69			0
while we all wait for the day when our public education is fixed for the have - nots , will the @entity10 make education a civil rights issue and demand that students in the worst schools be allowed to leave via vouchers ? and will it also fight to equalize funding across the board for those inner city schools that are unable to compete with suburban schools ? racial profiling			1
there is nothing more insidious and unconstitutional than police officers pulling folks over or frisking them based on nothing in particular , except the color of their skin			0
numerous cities and states have documented this horrible practice			0
the @entity31 is gearing up to advance a federal anti-racial profiling bill			2
will @entity14 and the @entity10 join them in an effort to say no more to this hideous practice ? voting rights			2
the right to vote is at the heart of our democracy , and it 's shameful to watch members of both political parties use archaic rules to prevent folks from voting			2
we have seen voters with no history of criminal activity purged from voting rolls			0
it 's time that we have consistent rules nationally and not be subject to various state , county and city rules			2
as @entity138 justice @entity137 wrote in the @entity140 decision , there is no affirmative right to vote in the @entity27			0
our @entity26 forbids minorities and women being disenfranchised ( it 's interesting to note that basically white men can be denied the right to vote , depending on how you look at this )			0
in @entity79 , if you move from one address to another , you are automatically removed from the voting rolls			0
why not have your voting rights follow you to a new address ? we have a driver 's license that is legal in all parts of a state , why not the voting card ? to fix the overlapping and confusing rules , it 's time we amend the @entity26 and establish a clear and affirmative right to vote			2
tea partiers , are you willing to support that ? congressman @entity163 has had such a bill ready to be voted on for nearly a decade			1
" tea partiers claim they are all about the @entity26 , that they are patriots			1
how crazy is it for someone who is gay to be kicked out of the @entity27 military solely because of his or her sexuality ? the right wing has made a major effort to keep gays and lesbians from serving openly , and the left has fought to have the measure repealed			0
if the blood of a homosexual flows the same on the battlefield as that of a heterosexual , then what 's the problem ? @entity14 , is this the kind of civil right you and the @entity10 support or oppose ? leading a 21st century @entity190			1
at the time of his assassination in 1968 , dr. @entity3 and the @entity192 were planning the @entity190 , set for @entity195 , to show the plight of poverty in @entity27			0
today , we have republicans in @entity200 who are against a jobs bill and extending unemployment benefits , but are ardent supporters of keeping the 2001 and 2003 @entity205 tax cuts for the wealthy			0
will the @entity10 put the concerns of @entity27 's poor at the forefront of its movement ? the @entity7 was n't just about those at the top , but the downtrodden , disenchanted and ignored			1
i have n't heard @entity213 talking about the least of those among us			0
so , @entity14 , will we see tea partiers descend on the nation 's capital to demand that lawmakers stop ignoring the nation 's poor ? it 's easy for @entity14 and other @entity213 to casually toss out assertions that they are fighting for the civil rights of @entity13			1
fine , but put your money where your mouth is			0
it 's time to call the @entity15 together at the table with the civil rights establishment to forge a comprehensive civil rights strategy headed into the midterm elections and 2011			1
saying it is one thing , @entity213 , but doing it is another			0
you 've talked the talk , now it 's time to walk the walk			1
so what say you ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243			2

@entity243 says @entity10 spokesman claimed civil rights high ground in recent debate
@entity10 's *criticism* of @entity31 would surprise civil rights groups , he says
he *challenges* @entity10 to address racial profiling , education , " do n't ask , do n't tell "
@entity243 : tea partiers have talked the talk on civil rights , now they should walk the walk
