@entity0 , @entity1 -- a spokesman for the @entity4 denied on wednesday a weekend report that @entity4 representatives may meet with officials representing the government of president @entity9 in @entity10 in the coming weeks			1
" there is no doubt that @entity10 is a respectful country for us as it is the place for the house of @entity18 and many more @entity19 sacred , but the rumor which has recently been spread by media that the @entity4 delegation would meet with @entity24 representatives in the @entity10 is completely incorrect , " said spokesman @entity11 in a statement			1
he added that the @entity4 are working to create an understanding with the international community , but negotiations have not begun			1
that 's because a trust - building stage , which must come before any negotiations , has not been completed , he said			1
he called the reports " baseless and unconfirmed			2
" the statement came several days after a senior @entity1 official said that the @entity1 government was hoping to hold talks with @entity4 representatives in @entity10 in the coming weeks			1
the senior official , speaking anonymously as he was discussing sensitive diplomatic issues , said the plans for a meeting between insurgents and @entity1 officials were at such an early stage that it was not clear who would attend or when any talks would be held			1
" the principle is that , although there is now an agreement -- almost -- to set up an office in @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , that does n't necessarily mean that all conversations will take place in @entity50 , " the official said			0
" we will talk to the same or different individuals ( from the insurgency ) in a different location			0
obviously , @entity10 has been supportive of the recent agenda and has hosted talks in the past			1
it is likely that we are heading there in the future for meetings			0
" he said the dates and participants were still being worked out and insisted that any @entity10 discussions would feed into the @entity51 process			2
this is " absolutely not in opposition to the @entity51 process , " he added , calling the talks in that @entity75 state " a very substantive step forward			2
" while the @entity1 official was unable to say whether the @entity79 would attend any talks held in @entity10 , he insisted , " the @entity79 is supportive of the idea			1
it is far too early to discuss any specifics about this			0
" the creation of a parallel process to the @entity51 talks risks frustrating @entity79 efforts to bring the @entity4 and @entity1 officials together			1
the current " talks about talks " in @entity50 are the product of months of @entity79 efforts to reach out to the insurgency , which came to sudden fruition last month when the @entity4 announced that they would support opening an office in their name in @entity51			1
officials in president @entity9 's government privately voiced frustration at being excluded from the early stages of this process , but agreed to support it last week			0
the official said the @entity51 process could move forward once the @entity51 send a delegation to @entity0 to discuss the next steps , adding that he hoped that would be soon			0
he said that , as of last weekend , there were no @entity1 government officials in @entity51 to support any discussions			2
" to fully assume ownership of the @entity51 process is important for us , " the official added			0
" we will work in the weeks ahead " to do that			0
he said the @entity79 needed a clear statement from the insurgents , distancing themselves from terrorism , for their role in the @entity51 process to move forward and for an office to be established			0
" we know and are aware the are @entity4 representatives in @entity50 , " he said			2
" there are channels in fact , and we are aware of the presence			0
what 's not yet established is the office			0
" @entity2 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			2

@entity4 spokesman says any negotiations must be *preceded* by a trust - building stage
he calls the report of talks with @entity1 representatives in @entity10 " baseless and unconfirmed "
