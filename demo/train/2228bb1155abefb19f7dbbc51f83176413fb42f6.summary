editor 's note : on @entity5 's " @entity4 , " host and chief national correspondent @entity2 goes outside the @entity6 to report on the issues affecting communities across the country			1
@entity10 , an unemployed single mother , says a big support group helps her stay positive			1
@entity12 , @entity13 ( @entity5 ) -- @entity10 knew it was coming			1
" there were five of us , including the owners			2
i did the books ... and i could see it was getting tight , money was			2
they just were n't making the money			2
" it was just before @entity25			2
" they let me go , and they knew i was going to sink , " the 42 - year - old single mother recalled			1
" two weeks later , i lost my apartment			2
no money coming in , no money to pay rent			2
" for a couple of weeks , she lived in her van -- until it broke down			2
now , she crashes on friends ' couches , and her three children sleep at her ex-husband 's apartment			1
" i 'm grateful because he was there to pick up the ball when i just could n't do it anymore , " @entity10 said			2
wherever she goes , @entity10 keeps a packed but organized file : her road map for surviving recession			2
" this is a sheet that tells me where free lunches are in the community so that my kids can eat for free , " she said , holding the stack of papers and brochures			2
" i try to stay up on that			0
" she keeps it handy , and not just to help with her needs			0
" i try to carry it so that if i hear of somebody that is struggling , it is like , ' wait , i know where you can find help			0
' i know i am not the only person that needs the help			0
she is the executive director of programs for the @entity73 in @entity12 , a family - support organization that is being replicated across the state			1
in the first three months of 2009 , it helped as many families as it did in all of 2008			1
" and we served over 1,000 children last year , " @entity77 said at the @entity12 facility			1
" so that 's telling you how drastic the increase is			1
there are newly needy families , and what i mean by that are families who have had jobs , who have had one - or two - parent incomes , who have had a home , might have even been small donors to the @entity73 or volunteered their time here			1
" and now they are calling us , saying , ' i just lost my job , or my wife and i both lost our jobs , we 're losing our home , and we do n't even know what the best [ support ] system is -- so forget how to navigate it			1
' what we 're finding in @entity13 is that early childhood and family hunger is drastically increased			1
" increased demand but diminished resources -- a cruel irony of the recession is that government and private funding sources are drying up			0
in the case of @entity73 , that means a waiting list of more than 200 families			1
" every single funding source that typically supports us is having a challenge right now , " @entity77 said			0
" when we have people calling saying , ' my family does n't have food ' or ' i 'm losing my house , and i do n't know where to turn , ' that is difficult if we ca n't help them			1
" not that there are not some encouraging signs			0
the @entity73 , whose primary mission is helping children and families with a history of abuse and neglect , was trying to combat the hunger problem , only to have its mobile food bank recently destroyed by vandals			1
when word of the crime spread , there was a dramatic spike in good donations , and a library area inside its building has been converted for food storage			0
" we 've also started doing what we call a family fun and food night , which is once a month families come and gather and have a fun meal together , " @entity77 said			1
" when we started this in january , the first time we held it , we had 30 families attend			1
and it 's been growing as word had gotten out to our families			1
and last week we had over 170 families come			1
" @entity10 's family is among them , often after she has spent another frustrating day hunting for work			1
" it 's really tough , " she said of the job market in a state where the unemployment rate has doubled in the past year to more than 12 percent			1
" i am finding that i am competing with -- that when you apply for a job , now you have 200 other people standing in the same line			0
" no room in the shelters , either			0
" which makes her all the more grateful for the @entity73 safety net			0
her son @entity177 , who will be 4 in october , comes for three hours a day , which means two meals and playing and activities time that are invaluable to a boy trying to overcome a speech impediment			0
twice a week , @entity177 also gets speech therapy at the center			0
" it is awesome , " @entity10 said during a walk in the play area outside			0
" i know they are safe			0
i know they are well taken care of			0
he 's got a physical disability , but they meet his needs continuously			1
i do n't have to worry about him being hurt			0
we have had some major challenges in our life , and i just call @entity73			0
" although the job search has been frustrating , @entity10 volunteers a few hours a week at her former employer , hoping that if business picks up some , she will be offered her old job back			0
and keeping busy , she says , helps her keep her spirits up			0
" i have a big support group that encourages me and keeps me positive			2
i ca n't lose hope , because my kids will lose hope			0
i ca n't let that happen			0
