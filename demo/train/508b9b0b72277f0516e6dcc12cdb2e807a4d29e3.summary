thousands of @entity1 volunteers across the country felt the effects of the government shutdown on friday as their modest living allowances were reduced by more than a third due to a lack of funding			1
" i did not know until this week what my stipend would look like and then i found out it was going to be 65 % of what i generally would expect , " said @entity8 , 30 , a volunteer in @entity9			1
the shortage affects more than 2,000 participants in the @entity16 program who make a year - long commitment to work at nonprofit organizations or public agencies on projects to fight poverty			1
the @entity16 living allowance is based on the federal poverty level , and helps volunteers pay for basic living expenses during their service , meaning even a minor reduction can force them to make some tough decisions			1
@entity30 proposals emerge that address debt ceiling but not shutdown " it means that some real decisions have to be made , " said @entity8 , whose $ 300 pay check was cut to approximately $ 200 on friday			1
" it literally means either a cell phone payment or a student loan payment			2
" @entity8 and his wife moved to @entity40 , @entity41 , in 2010 after receiving master 's degrees at the @entity43			0
combined the couple has more than $ 200,000 in student loans and count on @entity8 's paycheck to help keep up with their payments			0
founded by @entity50 in 1965 as @entity16 , today @entity16 participants receive a living allowance every two weeks , and at the end of their service they 're eligible for a scholarship , which in 2012 was worth $ 5,500			2
" they 've been asked to continue to serve , they 're getting a partial payment this month , they do n't know what 's going to happen next month , so their future 's really uncertain , " said @entity58 , executive director of @entity59			2
" we were talking to someone on @entity61 who said it was literally a choice of do i pay rent or do i buy groceries			0
" federal workers ' bad day -- 40 % less in paycheck the paycheck volunteers received on friday represents compensation for the last pay period in september , but nothing for the first days of october			2
under @entity1 rules , volunteers are prohibited from getting a second job to help bring in extra money			1
if they drop out of the program , they become ineligible for the year - end scholarship			1
in @entity8 's case , he and his wife are counting on that scholarship to help cover student loan costs while he looks for a job next fall			2
@entity83 , executive director of @entity84 , a group that advocates on behalf of organizations like @entity1 , said , " part of the culture of the organization is that to best understand people in poverty you have to live in poverty , " said			1
@entity1 and the @entity16 program are both part of the @entity95			1
in the agency 's contingency plan posted before the shutdown , it outlines that for " non-grant , non-cost share vistas , the living allowance will continue to accrue but not be paid until funding is restored			2
" there 's also a new class of volunteers waiting to begin their assignments whose start date may be pushed back if the government is n't reopened soon			1
" what makes this so troubling is you 've got a group of people working on behalf of community members in poverty , " said @entity83			0
" when these members are n't on the job or ca n't begin their term of service you have people they 're trying to help who are already on the brink of some dire circumstances			0
so when this level of support goes away it 's really disastrous			0
" in the event that the government shutdown continues , @entity58 and his fellow alumni are exploring ways to fill the funding gap			0
they posted a form online to solicit information from volunteers in need and received responses from 30 organizations and more than 300 individuals in the first 30 minutes			0
in total , they 've reached out to150 organizations and more than 640 @entity16 volunteers to find out where the need is the greatest			0
" those of us who served in @entity1 know what that experience means and what it means to serve your country in national service , " @entity58 said			1
" and when we see people serving their country faced with these dire circumstances we want to do something about it			0
" in some cases , local organizations are stepping in to provide assistance to their volunteers , and @entity59 is considering soliciting donations or even taking out a private loan to help make volunteers ' paychecks whole			0
" these are individuals who should be empowered and celebrated for the hard and critical work that they 're doing and not be faced with an unnecessary and really dire set of choices to make , " @entity58 said .			0

shutdown will reduce checks for @entity1 volunteers by more than a third
