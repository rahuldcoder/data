-- on wednesday , i wrote a not - at - all controversial column on this website titled , " the argument for eating dog			1
" the piece ran with a visual essay on @entity8 about the illegal dog meat trade in @entity10 , which is just awful to look at			1
i argued that the dog trade should be cleaned up and made more humane -- but that the same should happen to factory farms here in the @entity13			2
the crux of the argument was this : if we think dog should n't be eaten -- like , ever , regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill -- then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat , and if and why we do n't feel the same way about them			1
is it because we spend so much time with dogs -- looking into their eyes , talking to them , walking them , picking up their crap -- that we understand that they are living , breathing , feeling beings ? would we feel that way about other animals if we could hang out more ? the implication : eating pig , another highly intelligent animal , is just like eating dog			1
if we do n't want to eat dog -- which i said i did n't -- maybe we should rethink pig and the rest			1
the @entity45 had deeper suspicions			0
and they turned out to be pretty hilarious			0
someone claimed to leak an image from my new @entity0 " show , " which ostensibly features me cooking up chihuahua and plopping a pekingese into a pot for our viewers			0
it 's not real , of course			0
but some of you seemed to fear that it was			0
@entity60 compiled a list of " 23 people who really do n't want @entity0 to eat their dogs			1
" among them , @ gourmetspud : the @entity65 wrote that i made " social media explode			1
" others pointed to an irony in my @entity71 bio , which says i 'm " rooting for the world 's underdogs			2
" when i 'm not writing quick columns to go with @entity8 posts , i run a project at @entity0 called change the list , which tries to raise awareness about bottom - of - the - list places			2
but in the context of the dog piece , i get how weird that looks			2
some guy changed it to " sauteing the world 's underdogs			0
" one of my colleagues here in @entity87 printed out the image of me with the chef 's hat and a dalmatian in each hand and taped it to the wall in the newsroom			0
it got me thinking about how ridiculous -- and awesomely absurd -- it would be if that show actually came to fruition , especially since i 'm an advocate for treating animals humanely			2
maybe the premier could feature the ethics of pizza delivery dogs			2
we could call it " bring me your puppies ! " on @entity0 , 9 p.m. et. right after " @entity107 360			0
" guest host : @entity109			0
mostly , i feel # sorrynotsorry about the " controversy " that column created			0
i stand by the argument that eating dog is morally parallel to eating pig -- another intelligent , friendly creature			1
and , to be clear , i 'm not saying people should eat dog			1
i 'm saying we should rethink what we eat and why			1
but apparently @entity13 does n't want to look in that mirror			0
it 's way more fun to say you hope i 'll get eaten by a cannibal			0
a genuine thank you to @entity60 , @entity125 , @entity65 and others for helping me round up the most hilarious responses to the column .			1

" i 'm saying we should rethink what we eat and why "
