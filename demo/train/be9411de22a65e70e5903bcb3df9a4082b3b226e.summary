-- q : i 've heard so much about the dangers of drinking soda			0
is it really all that bad for you ? or is it just empty calories ? you may have heard about a new study published in the may issue of the @entity12 that found an increased risk of stroke in people who consumed more than one soda per day			2
these findings are not surprising in light of the growing body of evidence linking intake of sugar sweetened beverages -- of which soda makes up the largest percentage -- and diseases such as diabetes , heart disease , obesity and high cholesterol			1
sugar sweetened beverage consumption has increased significantly over the past several decades			1
recent @entity33 data found that half of the @entity36 population consumes at least one sugar sweetened beverage on any given day			1
men consume on average 178 calories per day from sugar sweetened beverages and women consume 103 calories per day			1
of particular concern in light of the current childhood obesity epidemic is the increased use in children , especially teens and young adults			0
@entity52 often displaces more healthful items in the diet and is a warning sign of a poor quality diet			1
the dangers of soda extend beyond the increase in calories , although this is likely an important contributor to weight gain and obesity			0
calories consumed in liquid form do not satisfy hunger as effectively as calories consumed in solid food form , so people often consume more total calories , which can lead to weight gain			2
in addition , consuming large amounts of rapidly digested sugar and high fructose corn syrup causes a spike in blood sugar and insulin , which can lead to inflammation and insulin resistance , both of which may increase your risk of stroke , heart disease , diabetes , obesity and cancer			0
the large doses of fructose from both sucrose ( table sugar ) and high fructose corn syrup may be particularly detrimental to your health as they can cause the accumulation of metabolically toxic belly fat , cholesterol abnormalities -- including high triglycerides and reduced levels of @entity100 ( good cholesterol ) -- and nonalcoholic associated fatty liver disease			0
@entity52 is also associated with symptoms of gastro - esophageal reflux disease , when the contents of the stomach leak back up and cause a burning sensation in the esophagus			0
while drinking soda is not known to cause ulcers , it can cause symptoms to flare up			0
the @entity114 recommends consuming no more than 450 calories from sugar sweetened beverages per week ( the amount in three cans of cola )			1
if you are overweight or obese , or at risk for heart disease or diabetes , you should limit your intake of sugar sweetened beverages as much as possible , including soda , energy drinks , sports drinks , juice drinks and sweetened water and / or tea .			2
