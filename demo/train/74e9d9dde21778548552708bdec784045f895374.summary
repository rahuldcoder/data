@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 did not participate in the recent online " blackouts , " in which @entity7 and others made their websites inaccessible to @entity11 visitors for a day , because it would have been counterproductive , the company 's ceo said monday night			1
" you do n't pull the batteries out of the microphone , " @entity12 told audience members during an onstage interview at @entity16 's d : @entity21 conference here			1
instead , @entity5 proved to be a key platform for people exchanging information about the controversial @entity25 ( @entity25 ) and similar proposed legislation , @entity12 said			1
about 3.9 million messages about @entity25 and its sister bill , @entity30 , were posted to @entity5 on january 18 , the day of the blackout , he said			1
after a huge outcry online , both bills have since been shelved			0
addressing the new censorship policy that @entity5 announced last week to much outrage and confusion , @entity12 maintained that his company has taken the right approach			1
he repeatedly said that scholars would one day determine that @entity5 had made the right move			1
" i think it 's a super-complex issue , " @entity12 said			1
" it takes a while for the scholars and the people who have studied these issues to chime in			0
" @entity5 's new rule , which many felt was poorly explained when it was introduced , would allow the company to remove a tweet according to the law in one country while having it remain visible for people in other countries			1
previously , the tweet would disappear for everyone			0
this is n't just for countries with strict censorship rules and human - rights issues			0
it applies to tweets in the @entity11 that are removed as a result of copyright takedown notices , @entity12 noted			1
" it is simply not the case that you can operate in these countries and choose which laws you want to abide by , " @entity12 said			1
" there 's been no change in our stance or attitude or policy with respect to content on @entity5			1
" the first topic of the interview involved @entity5 's battle with @entity80 regarding the latter seeming to favor its own social network in search results over its rivals '			2
@entity80 has been under some pressure in @entity86 recently over charges of anti-competitive practices			0
once a @entity80 engineer after the search giant acquired his company @entity91 , @entity12 suggested that @entity80 may have lost its moral compass			2
" they 've always been a mission - driven company , " he said			0
@entity12 offered no clear explanation about why @entity5 , which now has some 900 employees and more than 100 million active users , and @entity80 could not come to an agreement over including tweets in @entity80 search results			1
@entity80 indexes 1,300 of @entity5 's pages every second , he said			2
" i think they have the data they need , " he said			0
toward the end of the interview , @entity12 found time to discuss the 2012 presidential campaign , in which @entity5 has played an active role			1
candidates can mold their public perception through a successful @entity5 persona , he said			2
" gosh , i really think 2012 is going to be the @entity5 election , " he said			2
the corny " spilled milk " joke that fell flat in president @entity116 's @entity118 address was instantly panned on @entity5 , reactions people could analyze in real time , @entity12 noted			1
and @entity12 should know something about a well - timed joke : he was previously an improvisational comedian in @entity123			2
@entity12 won the audience over by sprinkling deadpan gags and self - deprecating humor into the pre-dinner interview			2
" look , i took an @entity130 backstage , so we 've got about seven minutes , " he said at the outset			0
@entity12 joked that his and the interviewer 's faces were " a little too close			0
" he later told the interviewer , " first of all , you have a very soothing voice			0
i 'm picking up on that			0
" he poked fun at the big red " dental chair " that the @entity142 organizers plop every interviewee into at each conference			0
after making an insightful observation , he told the interviewer , " you like that ? you swiveled in your chair a little bit			0
" if he had been a political candidate , @entity12 likely would have passed the " would i want to get a beer with this guy ? " test that has been informally applied as a measure of a candidate 's likeability .			0
