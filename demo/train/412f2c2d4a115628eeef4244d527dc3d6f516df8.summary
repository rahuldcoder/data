@entity0 -- if at first you succeed , then by all means , try , try again			0
president @entity4 returned to a successful strategy from last year 's election campaign by calling friday for college students and their families to mount pressure on congressional republicans to prevent a jump in some student loan rates set to occur on july 1			1
" higher education can not be a luxury for a privileged few , " he said at the @entity13 with college students standing behind him			2
" it is an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford , every young person with dreams and ambitions should be able to access and now 's not the time for us to turn back on young people			0
" the @entity27 appearance angered @entity29 leaders , who contend they have proposed a reasonable solution			2
" no one should be fooled by today 's campaign - style event at the @entity13 , " said a statement by @entity29 leader @entity32 of @entity33			2
he added that @entity4 " appears more interested in needlessly stoking partisan divisions in @entity0 than helping young @entity37 avoid a higher interest rate on their student loans			1
" the issue is both practical and political			0
student loan mess : what 's at stake ? if @entity49 does n't act in coming weeks , interest rates on government - subsidized @entity46 loans for college students will double from the current 3.4 % to 6.8 % starting in july			1
only students taking out new subsidized loans after july 1 would be affected , as those getting unsubsidized loans already pay the 6.8 % rate			2
about 7 million students , a third of the total taking out loans , would be affected			0
@entity4 said friday the impact would mean those students needing subsidized loans would have to pay about $ 1,000 more a year			1
when he asked how many in the crowd could afford that , several heads shook " no. " to qualify for subsidized @entity46 loans , students must meet an income threshold			0
the event allowed @entity4 to revert to a topic he benefited from in his successful re-election campaign last year , and to divert attention from controversies dogging his administration early in his second term such as @entity74 targeting of conservative groups and secret subpoenas of journalists ' phone records			2
@entity79 argue that @entity4 basically agrees with their approach , which would tie the student loan rate to economic factors instead of leaving it up to @entity49			1
however , the two sides remain at odds over specifics including how fast and high the interest rates could rise			0
a measure recently passed by @entity89 would mean that the rate for all new student loans would be about 5 % for the first year , but would likely rise in the future because it would be linked to the rate on 10 - year treasury bonds , which currently are low			0
@entity4 's budget proposal for next fiscal year would hold down rates for subsidized loans to about 3 % in the first year , with other students paying about 5 %			1
those rates also would be linked to the 10 - year treasury bond levels and therefore would likely increase in future years			0
the president criticized the @entity13 @entity29 proposal as " not smart " and " not fair , " saying it would increase the burden on middle - and lower - income families to pay for a college education			1
he reminded listeners that their pressure last year persuaded legislators to extend the current 3.4 % rate on subsidized loans through june instead of letting it double in 2012			1
" you 're going to have to call them up again or e-mail them again or tweet them again and ask them ' what happened , what changed ? ' " @entity4 said			0
differences between the two sides involve when the rate on a loan gets locked in , with @entity4 calling for it to happen right away while the @entity13 measure would allow it to rise until a student graduates			1
another difference concerns maximum rates			0
the @entity13 measure would cap interest rates at 8.5 % for student loans while the @entity4 proposal would contain no such cap but would include a program to limit a former student 's annual expenditures on the loan to no more than 10 % of discretionary income			2
a @entity13 @entity29 aide noted that the @entity138 - controlled @entity29 has yet to act on the issue , and echoed @entity141 's statement in saying that the @entity13 and @entity4 agree on the principle of tying the student loan rate to economic factors			1
later friday , senate majority leader @entity145 , @entity146 , announced he planned for the chamber to vote next week on a @entity138 measure to extend the current 3.4 % rate for subsidized loans for two years , which would put off the matter until after the 2014 congressional elections			1
the measure would eliminate some tax breaks , including one for oil companies , to pay the federal cost of extending the lower interest rate			0
such tax components appear certain to ensure @entity79 opposition			0
meanwhile , the @entity160 announced friday it was launching ads in six college newspapers that urge students to pressure @entity49 to keep loan rates low			1
@entity166 's @entity165 and @entity1 's @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
