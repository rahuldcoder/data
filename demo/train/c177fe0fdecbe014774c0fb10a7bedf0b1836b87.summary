@entity0 , @entity1 -- when we landed in @entity5 , @entity1 it did n't take me long to spot @entity7			1
he was the only six - foot tall bearded red - headed guy wearing an olive - green fatigue jacket and a wide - brimmed bush hat			0
when his hearty welcoming words : " hello , @entity11 , how are you ? " boomed out in @entity13 amongst the @entity15 - speaking crowd at the arrival gate , i was certain we had located our host			0
we loaded our gear into his 4x4 truck and began the two - hour journey towards his home at the southernmost tip of continental @entity23			1
the @entity7 family has always been a bit different than everyone else in this part of @entity28 -- and that is exactly why we came here			1
they are eco-pioneers in more ways than one			0
@entity7 's great - great grandfather , @entity33 , came to @entity1 from @entity34 , @entity35 in 1885 to become @entity37 's first medical doctor			1
@entity33 married a wealthy widow and began living on her homestead overlooking the rough seas at the mouth of the @entity42			0
the area had been christened @entity0 -- " @entity46 " -- by gold prospectors -- and sheep were soon introduced			2
five generations later , the @entity47 are still tending sheep here , producing high - quality wool and meat that is in demand around the globe			2
a few years ago though , 40 - year - old @entity7 began to have doubts about the farming methods that his forbearers had passed on to him			1
traditionally , he tells me , sheep mostly stay put , continually grazing on the same pastures			1
a century 's worth of this overgrazing had caused the desertification of much of the fragile grasslands at @entity0			1
so @entity7 began to devise a method to change his sheep herding practices , and after research in @entity1 , @entity68 and @entity13 , he introduced a new system that constantly rotates the sheep to different pastures , thus allowing the grass to regenerate			1
this holistic herding has had a tremendous effect on his land , and helped bring much of it back to life			1
" what we are really trying to do here is imitate what @entity80 used to do -- which is the natural herding of the wildlife , " says @entity7			1
essentially , @entity7 has switched from being a sheep farmer that uses grass , to a grass farmer that uses sheep			1
but getting his stubborn fellow farmers to make the switch too was a challenge			2
but slowly his efforts have paid off , and now 120 farms in @entity1 , @entity94 and @entity95 are a part of the @entity97 -- a network which fosters innovation in sheep breeding and land management across @entity23			1
" we use biological indicators to assess the health of ecosystem processes , " says @entity102 , an @entity97 director			0
" we disclose the land health status of every farmer to the customers			2
a farmer must have positive biological indicators			0
if he does n't , he has to change his management and fix the problem			0
" as @entity7 and i walk through thick grass in a steady rain on @entity0 , the evidence is clear			1
he shows me areas where new green grass is now growing despite having been dry and dead just a few years earlier			0
later , we drive past a neighboring farm that still does things the old - fashioned way and there was a distinct difference in the look and feel of the grasslands			2
the pioneering method employed by the @entity97 partners has now attracted the attention of conservation groups and clothing makers alike			2
the @entity134 is providing technology like satellite mapping and its scientists are working with the farmers to continue the effort to regenerate the grasslands			1
and @entity140 - based clothing company , @entity28 , plans to use the wool in their upcoming clothing lines			0
" @entity97 has an on - the - ground reach that is amazing , plus great respect from the ranchers they have been working with for a long time			0
this fact spoke volumes to our company ; it is n't often we get to see that far back in the supply chain , " says @entity147 , @entity28 's director of environmental strategy			0
this international recognition also bodes well for the @entity7 's other business : agro-tourism			1
they were amongst the first in @entity1 to open their estancia to curious travelers from around the globe to hear how an @entity13 - speaking @entity163 family has thrived in a remote part of @entity15 - speaking @entity1			1
" the people that make the effort to come here , they arrive and they say there 's something special about this place			0
what it is , i don Â´ t know			0
you have to see it with your own eyes , " says @entity7 's mother , @entity176 , as we sit in the cozy living room of their ranch house			1
that 's not to say that living at the end of the earth is easy , for the sheep or their herders			2
i spent three days at @entity0 and i can attest to the challenges there : it is windy , cold and wet , and the sun is temperamental , at best			0
it is also breathtakingly beautiful			0
" people often say to me : ' what a sacrificed life you live here with the climate and lack of social life			0
' but this is a type of life you either love or hate			0
and we love it , " says @entity7 's father , @entity203			2
perhaps most important to the @entity47 is that their new shepherding methods are not only helping them to better sustain and profit from their land , but are also helping reduce the build - up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere			2
" natural grasslands today in the world could capture as much or more carbon than forests and could be a very big help to the environment , " says @entity7			1
and that shows that making progress in @entity28 can have a positive impact on the entire planet			0
the earth could use more pioneers like the @entity47 .			0

@entity227 travels to the tip of @entity23 to meet a pioneering family of farmers
@entity7 employs " holistic herding " of sheep to improve yield for business and land
continuing grazing on same land causes desertification of fragile grasslands
@entity7 is part of a network which *promotes* sustainable methods to other farmers in @entity23
