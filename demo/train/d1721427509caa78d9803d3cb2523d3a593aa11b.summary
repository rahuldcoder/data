@entity0 -- for months now , the @entity2 has been complaining about @entity4 's class warfare : he 's pitting the wealthy against the middle class			1
he 's unfairly asking the rich to pay more taxes			2
he 's dividing the country along economic lines for his own political agenda			0
has anybody looked at what 's going on in the @entity2 lately ? can it be that class warfare is alive and thriving among @entity2 ? @entity14 looks that way			1
how else to explain @entity16 calling the president a " snob " for emphasizing the importance of a college education ? and when @entity16 says that @entity22 's speech about the absolute separation between church and state made him want to " throw up , " he 's not exactly aiming for the academic theologians			1
in the meantime , @entity27 -- that establishment fellow -- is out there on the trail talking about his wife driving " a couple " of @entity33			2
not to mention the fact that he knows the owners , not the drivers , of @entity38 teams			0
contrast that to @entity16 's venture into the @entity41 : his campaign is sponsoring a car , not hobnobbing with team owners			1
looks like the @entity2 is driving around some circular tracks of its own , would n't you say ? in many ways , this detour into class distinctions is n't surprising ; it 's actually been percolating for years			1
remember when @entity2 first spoke about the " @entity56 " members of their party -- that is , their working - class , socially conservative demographic ? they were onto something			1
in fact , the less - educated , white voters have been shifting toward the @entity2 for some time -- and have given the party much of its grass - roots energy			2
so in scurries @entity16 , trying to differentiate himself from @entity27 and fill the populist void			1
as it turns out , it 's pretty easy : he 's the guy from blue - collar @entity66 , the grandson of a coal miner			0
and @entity27 is a member of the business elite , a platinum card - carrying member of the @entity2 establishment , son of a scion of the party			1
better yet , @entity27 keeps reminding voters ( inadvertently ) that he 's not like them , each time he tries to connect with the @entity77			2
" it may be important for a voter to be able to relate to a president , " a senior @entity16 adviser told me			2
" but it 's more important for a president to be able to relate to that voter			0
" so @entity16 is trying to relate to every @entity86 voter			0
in @entity89 , for instance , evangelicals could account for as much as half of the @entity2 primary electorate			0
and @entity16 figures he 's getting them pretty well locked up with his church - and - state talk			2
as for those who self - identify as strongly conservative , he figures he 's handing them red meat with his chatter about @entity4 's snobbery -- and @entity27 's flip - flopping on conservative issues			1
" we have a long and storied track record of fighting for conservative causes compared to the other candidate who is running here in @entity89 at the top of the polls , " said @entity16			0
" we have a clear difference between someone who has fought in the trenches of the country for conservative causes			0
" @entity16 's attacks on @entity27 just expose the huge chasm within the @entity2 between the old elite and the new insurgents			1
and no matter who becomes the nominee , one faction will be disappointed , and disaffected			0
the question that remains : whether their dislike of @entity4 can bring the unity that has so far eluded them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .			0

@entity127 says now it 's the @entity2 who are playing class warfare
she notes that the @entity2 *criticized* president @entity4 for " class warfare " on taxes
@entity16 is trying to make the case that he represents middle class , she says
@entity127 : @entity16 trying to differentiate himself from @entity27 , who is much richer
