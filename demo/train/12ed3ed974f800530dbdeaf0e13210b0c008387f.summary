-- a @entity4 judge has refused for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8 - year - old girl and a 47 - year - old man , a relative of the girl told @entity0			1
the most recent ruling , in which the judge upheld his original verdict , was handed down saturday in the @entity4 city of @entity13 , where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl 's mother , who was seeking a divorce for her daughter			1
the relative said the judge , @entity26 , " stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty			1
" the family member , who requested anonymity , added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter			1
the case , which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups , came to light in december when @entity35 declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality			1
the judge ruled the girl 's mother -- who is separated from the girl 's father -- was not the girl 's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court , according to @entity45 , the mother 's lawyer			1
the girl 's father , according to the attorney , arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man , who is " a close friend " of his			1
at the time of the initial verdict , the judge required the girl 's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty , @entity45 told @entity0			1
the judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty , she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court , the lawyer said			1
last month , an appeals court in the @entity4 capital of @entity73 declined to certify the original ruling , in essence rejecting @entity35 's verdict , and sent the case back to @entity35 for reconsideration			1
under the complicated @entity4 legal process , the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect , but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing			1
the appeals court in @entity73 will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month , according to the relative			1
the issue of child marriage has been a hot - button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently			1
while rights groups have been petitioning the government to enact laws that would protect children from this type of marriage , the kingdom 's top cleric has said that it 's ok for girls as young as 10 to wed. " it is incorrect to say that it 's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger , " @entity103 , the kingdom 's grand mufti , said in remarks last january quoted in the regional @entity107 newspaper			2
" a girl aged 10 or 12 can be married			2
those who think she 's too young are wrong and they are being unfair to her			2
" @entity103 reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry			0
" we hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls , " he said , according to the newspaper			0
" we should know that @entity127 law has not brought injustice to women			0
" sharia law is @entity132 law			0
@entity4 follows a strict interpretation of @entity132 called @entity134			0
@entity0 was unable to reach government officials for comment			2
@entity137 , a @entity4 researcher for @entity138 , told @entity0 in december that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages			2
" we 've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the @entity4 public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men , " @entity137 said			0
@entity137 explained that while @entity4 ministries may make decisions designed to protect children , " it is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts , and in many realms beyond the court			0
" last december , @entity159 , a spokesman for the @entity4 government - run @entity160 , said his organization is fighting against child marriages			0
" the @entity160 opposes child marriages in @entity4 , " @entity159 said			0
" child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by @entity4 and should not be allowed			0
" he added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place			0
@entity167 , co-founder of the @entity168 , told @entity0 that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to " keep us backward and in the dark ages			2
" she said the marriages cause girls to " lose their sense of security and safety			0
also , it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured			0
it causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression			0
