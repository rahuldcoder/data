@entity0 , @entity1 -- as mental health advocates , policy makers , practitioners , educators and researchers gathered at the @entity10 to discuss the progress in addressing @entity14 children 's mental health needs , a drama of sorts was reaching its conclusion halfway across the country			1
the former first lady kicked off the 24th annual @entity18 on @entity19			0
the governor of @entity21 signed a bill friday to change a controversial safe - haven law by restricting the age at which a child could be dropped off at a hospital without parents being prosecuted			0
since the law took effect in september , 35 children -- all but six of them older than 10 -- have been dropped off at @entity21 hospitals			2
the revised law adds a 30 - day age limit ; it was approved by the legislature at a special session friday and goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. saturday			0
these two events appear to have little in common , but they are " intimately related , " according to @entity38 , one of the pivotal speakers at the 24th annual @entity40 on @entity19 in @entity0 , @entity1			0
" many of these families are families that have come to the attention of the service systems already , have been struggling since their children were young			2
they have n't gotten the help they need ; they are feeling totally desperate			0
we have a system that does n't respond early enough and with appropriate intensity			0
" @entity38 , director of the @entity52 and a clinical professor of population and family health at @entity57 's @entity56 , should know			2
twenty - five years ago , she wrote a report that summarized , state by state , the programs available to children with mental health needs and their families , and the policies that govern them			1
the portrait was a bleak one , with many states not even able to identify the dollar amount budgeted for children 's mental health			1
twenty - five years later , the situation is improved but is n't much better , according to the report 's sequel , " @entity75 : the status of children 's mental health policy in the @entity14 , " which was unveiled at the symposium			1
the landscape is still one of patchwork policy and hodgepodge programs both among states and within individual states , with very few states having a cohesive strategy for addressing the needs , much less the infrastructure and funding to carry that strategy out			0
" i am really distressed about how we treat children ; this is something i have worked on and been concerned about for years , " former first lady @entity92 told @entity2			2
" we know what to do for them , and we do n't do it			0
when we finally do something with them is when they get in trouble			0
" @entity104 has been a mental health advocate since 1970 , when her husband , former president carter , was running for governor of @entity1			1
" we have learned so much about children , about the developing brain and treatments that work , and we just do n't use them ; that is one reason this symposium is so important , " @entity104 said			2
" we have children 's advocates from across the nation , and if we can just band together and try to do something about it			2
this is a really , really great time , because we have a new administration in @entity121 , and hopefully we can form a strong enough advocacy group and get some things changed , if not everything we 'd like			2
" the endeavor is a giant undertaking , and the number of affected children and families is huge			1
research shows that approximately one in five children has a diagnosable mental disorder ranging from " mild , " such as attention - deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder , to the more severe			1
more than three - quarters of these children do n't get the services they need , and what they do get is based purely on chance : which state they happen to live in			1
" for the last 25 years , most of the leadership has come from states as opposed to having a federal system , " explains @entity144 , co-author of " @entity75			0
" " that is kind of our make - up in the @entity14 ; on the other hand , there are certain things that are very hard to move without having a federal vision			2
" @entity157 is the director of child health and mental health at the @entity52 and an assistant clinical professor of health policy and management at @entity56			1
" there are all kinds of consequences of untreated mental illness , " @entity157 said , from unneeded suffering to suicide to situations like the @entity167 shootings			2
" on the other end of the spectrum , untreated mental illness can cost us a lot of money in our system			0
if you want to talk in terms of cost effectiveness : we have a lot of kids in juvenile justice facilities , in child welfare facilities , because we are not intervening early enough with them			0
" that is not even counting the cost of lost productivity to society			0
" we know in the mental health community that if you give children good health care before and after birth , good nurturing , good mind stimulation , they have a much better chance to grow up to be contributors to the community , well - adjusted young people , " @entity104 said			1
" and we just do n't do it			0
it is very , very distressing			0
" there are many barriers to better mental health care for children : a lack of awareness of the issue , a lack of a unified vision from the federal government , no political will to change the situation , a lack of adequate funding and the de-stigmatization of mental illness			1
@entity104 , @entity157 and @entity38 all pointed to the recent passage of the " mental health parity " provision , tacked on to the $ 700 billion economic bailout bill , which would require health insurance companies to cover mental illness on an equal basis with physical illness			1
another hopeful sign , they say , is the incoming @entity230 administration and its possible appointment of former sen. @entity232 to be secretary of health and human services			1
" my hope for the new administration is that we will be able to enact , to build , a supportive health care framework and a mental health framework that makes sense given our knowledge and given it 's the 21st century , " @entity38 said			1
" and to really move forward			0
i am hoping that there will be support for this as we talk about health care reform			1
" the situation in @entity21 " is no surprise , " @entity38 said			0
" we need to see this as an opportunity to say ' this is why we need a stronger mental health system , ' not that we should only let people drop off the babies			1
this is a clarion call to say why it is so important that we build a mental health system that supports children and families			1
because these are families that are crying out for help , and we are saying there is nobody there			0

*experts* from across the country gather to discuss mental health needs of children

75 to *80* *percent* of affected children do not get the needed mental health services
