-- a truck stop is an assault on the senses , especially on a hot summer day			1
there 's the smell of diesel , the taste of exhaust fumes and the nerve - jangling , ever - present rumble of truck engines -- even when the drivers are asleep			1
@entity14 , right , explains the @entity16 system to a trucker at a @entity19 truck stop			1
typically , truckers idle their engines during warm weather while they 're resting , to keep the air conditioning on and the cabs cool			2
some truckers use devices that cool cabs without idling			1
most of these technologies either use batteries , which eventually wear out and have to be replaced , or fuel , which emits pollution			2
but @entity33 , a company that makes trucking equipment , has found an alternative			2
" it 's old technology turned new , " said @entity37 , director of commercial vehicles for @entity39 , @entity40			2
" actually , some people call it ' high - tech ice			2
' " @entity33 calls the system @entity16			1
the heart of the system is a 300 - pound black box that 's mounted on the truck 's frame rail			1
as the trucker drives , the system sends refrigerant through a matrix of graphite and a water / glycol mixture inside the box , creating blocks of ice			1
when the truck is stopped , the driver turns on an air handler that circulates coolant around the ice and blows cold air from the unit into the bunk area of the cab			2
the fan and circulation pump use only 3.5 to 10 amps from the truck 's battery -- which means there 's no danger of draining the battery , @entity33 says			2
" when it 's running it does n't have any emissions or use any fuel , " said @entity37			1
he said @entity16 can maintain a comfortable bunk temperature for up to ten hours			1
the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) estimates idling trucks consume nearly one gallon of fuel per hour , while emitting nitrogen oxides and particulates , which contribute to smog			1
a growing number of states and municipalities forbid trucks from idling for more than a few minutes			2
the pollution problem prompted @entity33 to launch a campaign to raise awareness of the idling issue			0
it 's called @entity94 ( @entity94 stands for @entity95 )			0
the campaign 's web site , http://www.makealeap.org / , is full of sobering state - by - state and national statistics			0
the site says 7.2 percent of the national daily oil consumption is attributed to heavy - duty truck idling			1
to decrease that percentage and increase awareness of @entity16 , @entity33 hired a trucker named @entity106 to take a bluecool - equipped truck on a summer publicity tour of truck stops across the country			1
the tour coincided with spiking fuel prices and appears to have succeeded -- @entity33 sold 500 @entity16 units in july , its best month ever			1
@entity106 said truckers have showed a lot of interest			0
" what really sells the item -- they come and the truck 's not idling			1
and all the trucks around me are idling , " he said			0
sometimes , he said , " they wake me up at 3:00 in the morning and ask me for brochures			0
they ca n't [ wait until daylight ] , they have to deliver a load			0
and then they keep apologizing to me for waking me up			0
" on a hot recent day at a @entity19 truck stop , truckers were especially attracted by the prospect of burning less diesel			0
@entity136 , who owns a small fleet of trucks , said , " most drivers			0
are on the road 100 days a year , so basically the more days you 're out there , the more money you spend trying to stay cool			0
" @entity136 said his truckers currently use @entity145 , an electrical system trucks can plug into for cooling , heating , and other services like the @entity150			0
but @entity145 is available only at a limited number of truck stops , and @entity136 said he 's considering @entity16			1
@entity33 's @entity37 said the installation price of a @entity16 system is approximately $ 5500			1
the system pays for itself in less than a year , he said			0
it sounds like sales hype , but @entity37 ' comment is backed up by @entity80 statistics			0
the @entity80 estimates the typical truck idles 2400 hours per year			0
at $ 4 a gallon , that 's $ 9600 in annual fuel costs .			0

a company has developed technology that cools truck cabs without engine idling
called @entity16 , the system combines refrigerant and a water / glycol mixture
@entity16 does n't have any emissions or use any fuel , *spokesman* says
some 7 percent of @entity178 daily oil consumption is attributed to heavy - duty truck idling
