-- a lie - detecting virtual border official nicknamed " @entity2 " is the latest high - tech approach to securing borders in the @entity5			1
developed by @entity8 researchers in collaboration with @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , the computer is known as the @entity11 in @entity12 -- or @entity13 -- kiosk			1
it uses sensors to screen passengers for unusual physiological responses to questioning -- which can indicate a subject is lying			2
" what we 're looking for is changes in human physiology , " said @entity21 , a member of the @entity8 team behind the project			2
" we 've had great success in reliably detecting these anomalies -- things that people ca n't really detect			0
" the kiosk is being trialled at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 -- a checkpoint on the @entity5 - @entity38 border -- as a way of processing passengers looking to sign up to @entity10 's " @entity42 " program			1
the program allows travelers pre-approved as " low - risk " to be fast - tracked through security processes			0
applicants for the program must undergo an interview and biometric fingerprinting to be eligible for the program -- both of which can be performed by the @entity52			2
@entity21 said the kiosk could process travelers in five minutes			2
travelers simply stand in front of the unit -- which " looks like an atm on steroids , " according to @entity21 -- and respond to yes / no questions asked in @entity58 or @entity59			1
" you speak to it like you speak to a person , " he said			0
their answers are monitored , with any unusual physiological responses passed on to " a human field agent " who then subjects them to " a more careful interview process , " said @entity10 spokesman @entity72			1
unusual responses were not a sure sign of a lie , said @entity21			0
" there might be valid reasons for it beyond deception			0
" read more : ' safe - list ' travelers get fast - track through airport security the computer uses three sensors to assess physiological responses : a microphone , which monitors vocal quality , pitch and frequency ; an infrared camera , which looks at pupil dilation and where the eyes focus ; and a high - definition camera recording facial expressions			1
some of the involuntary cues that betray whether a speaker is lying could be controlled , but not all of them at once			0
lab testing had indicated the machine was much more successful than humans at detecting these cues , according to @entity21			1
" people have a hard time detecting small changes in the frequency of the human voice , that a computer is much better at , " he said			1
" people are accurate about 54 % of the time at detecting deception ... we have got our machine as high as 90 % in the lab. " @entity72 said the project was still in the early phase of field testing , and participating in the @entity13 interview process was entirely voluntary at this stage			1
but if successful , the initiative could be rolled out in other parts of @entity10 's operations			0
@entity21 said it was hoped that , as well as providing better detection of suspicious behavior , the @entity52 would prove to be " a really important time and money saving tool			0
" initially , the kiosk did not have the avatar feature , but it was added after its developers found that without it , people would tend to speak to the machine in a robotic , unnatural manner			1
it even got a name among the team developing the project			0
" we call him @entity2 , or @entity142 , " said @entity21			0
" but when he 's in the field he 's just the @entity13 agent			2

the @entity13 kiosk scans interview subjects for signs of lying
it is being trialled in @entity35 and monitors voice , eyes and face movements
interview subjects speak to the machine , in @entity59 or @entity58 , as if it were human
if successful , the *technology* could be used elsewhere in @entity5
