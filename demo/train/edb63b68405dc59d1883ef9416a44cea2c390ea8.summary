-- you would think that in the shadow of a general election dubbed " @entity7 , " the last thing any @entity3 in @entity4 would want to do is tick off women			1
and while the @entity10 passed in the @entity11 by a healthy bipartisan majority a few hours before president @entity13 's @entity15 address , the fact that 22 senators -- all @entity3 , all men -- voted against it should be troubling to @entity3 leaders			1
and perhaps the most troubling aspect of that is @entity21 sen. @entity20 , the so - called savior of the @entity3 , was one of those @entity3 men			1
just think : a few hours before @entity20 was to deliver a message reflecting a new @entity3 , he casts a vote that screams more of the same			1
the jokes about him fidgeting like a 5 - year - old and chugging water during the rebuttal will eventually go away			2
but if he 's seriously thinking about running in 2016 , that one vote is going to come back to haunt him			2
especially if a revitalized @entity33 , and her 18 million cracks in the ceiling , is in the race			0
domestic violence vote key test of more inclusive @entity3 in a statement , he said he " could not support the final , entire legislation that contains new provisions that could have potentially adverse consequences			1
specifically , this bill would mandate the diversion of a portion of funding from domestic violence programs to sexual assault programs , although there 's no evidence to suggest this shift will result in a greater number of convictions			1
" the senate - version of reauthorization extends protections to @entity58 , gays and lesbians , and immigrants			0
it would allow the prosecution of @entity64 for abusing @entity66 women			0
regarding that , @entity20 said he voted against the bill because of " concerns regarding the conferring of criminal jurisdiction to some @entity73 tribal governments over all persons in @entity73 country , including non-indians			1
" translation : from a political standpoint , @entity20 blew it long before he lunged off - camera to grab a swig of water			2
and @entity83 wasted little time pointing this out			0
@entity3 's @entity20 rips @entity13 voting against a bill to help women because you 're not happy about the amount of money being spent on domestic violence vs. sexual assault is splitting some pretty fine hairs and just is n't choosing the right fight			1
especially when juxtaposed against the success of the programs			0
from the time the act passed through 2010 , intimate partner violence declined by 67 %			0
there has also been an increase in the arrests of suspects in domestic and violent sexual crimes			0
the new legislation has a provision that speeds up dna analysis in rape cases and a program to fight human trafficking			0
and if spending was a concern , the $ 659 million the @entity11 approved for @entity110 programs for the next five years is actually 17 % less than the amount approved in 2005			1
how could the face of a new , kinder , women - friendly @entity3 say no to that ? perhaps the reason why he needed water during the rebuttal is because he got cotton - mouthed listening to his party 's resounding approval when @entity13 mentioned the @entity11 passing the bill during the @entity15 address			1
or maybe he felt a tad faint when @entity127 speaker @entity126 was seen looking over and talking to vice president @entity128 -- who co-wrote the first incarnation of the bill nearly 20 years ago -- as he clapped in support			0
talk back : is giving the @entity15 response a political ' kiss of death ' ? and trust me , @entity126 did not spend a lot of time applauding @entity13 or talking to @entity128			0
this week , @entity127 majority leader @entity135 , who is spearheading the negotiations of a @entity127 bill , and @entity126 received a letter from 17 @entity139 urging them to take action , stating that the act 's " programs save lives , and we must allow states and communities to build upon the successes of current @entity10 programs so that we can help even more people			1
" the @entity3 knows that between the embarrassing remarks about rape made by several candidates during the last election cycle , the record 20 seats held by women in the @entity83 - held @entity11 and the 55 % of women who voted for @entity13 , regaining power requires a makeover			1
@entity20 appeared to be someone who could embody that change , but he did n't do himself any favors tuesday			2
not with his rebuttal and certainly not with this vote			0
opinion : a kinder , gentler , wiser @entity20 " mr. president , " @entity20 said in his speech , " i do n't oppose your plans because i want to protect the rich			2
i oppose your plans because i want to protect my neighbors			0
" i 'm going to assume none of his neighbors are women			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

@entity177 : @entity20 one of 22 male @entity3 senators to vote no on @entity10
@entity177 : just as @entity20 was to show new face of @entity3 , he cast a vote that 's the old face
@entity20 's reasons were *absurd* , he says , in light of a bill that really works to protect women
@entity10 's funding 17 % less than in 2005 , he says . how could a women - friendly @entity3 say no ?
