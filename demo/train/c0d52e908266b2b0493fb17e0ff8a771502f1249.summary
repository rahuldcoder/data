-- @entity1 is a man on a mission			1
the @entity4 president wants to transform his homeland into a developed nation by 2020			1
it 's a big challenge to undertake during a decade that 's already been marred by recession and global economic uncertainty			2
yet mr @entity1 seems confident			1
" we have invested so much that i hope that the next two years will be a time of harvest , " he told @entity0 's @entity11			0
" we will be able to show to the @entity4 people that @entity4 's a country which is absolutely able to defeat poverty , to overcome underdevelopment , and to join the @entity17			1
" so how does the president intend to turn his plans into a reality ? @entity4 already has a very pro-business environment , but @entity1 wants to open the doors of trade to his country even wider			1
as one of @entity4 's richest men , he is no stranger to business and according to @entity28 has amassed a fortune of $ 2.4 billion			1
he believes his entrepreneurial background leaves him ideally placed to send out a message to the world : @entity4 is open for business			1
" we have realised that we have to be integrated to the world , " he said			0
" we have to compete with the world			0
and that is why we have free - trade agreements , with the @entity39 , with @entity40 , with @entity41 , with @entity42 , with @entity43 , with @entity44 - you name it			1
" i think that 's the right path for @entity4 to become a developed country			1
" @entity1 : @entity39 ' printing money ' will not solve economic problems one of the key factors in @entity1 's plan to invigorate the @entity4 economy is a move towards digital and knowledge based industries			1
the country 's @entity59 initiative began in 2010 , and offers high potential global start - ups a $ 40,000 investment			1
no equity is ceded and the only requirement is that one member of the team live in @entity4 for six months			2
by the end of its first phase in 2014 it will have provided grants to 1,000 companies for a total of $ 40 million			0
its critics claim the project throws money away and does n't produce any long - term benefits			2
however , @entity1 claims most companies stay long after the initial six month period , creating jobs , mixing with local entrepreneurs and sharing ideas			2
" we 're importing and bringing to @entity4 people that have good ideas , entrepreneurship capacity and the ability to start a business here , " said @entity1			1
" what they will teach to our people is very , very valuable			0
to have a stable economy , to have a stable democracy , and to have a modern government is not enough			2
we have to build new pillars of development			0
education , science and technology , innovation and entrepreneurship , and more equality			0
" of course , @entity4 's future is n't simply reliant on establishing a sustainable domestic economic policy			2
it 's also dependent on exterior influences , and like all free - trade economies it has plenty to worry about			1
the problems in the eurozone , the fiscal cliff in the @entity39 , and the slowdown in @entity41 all loom in the air above the presidential headquarters of @entity114			0
he said : " i am very convinced that in these next two years , we will be able - even though the world will be in the middle of a crisis - to keep moving forward			0
at good pace , and with very good direction			0
" as a nation @entity4 is viewed as one of the most stable and secure countries in @entity123			2
it 's rich in mineral resources , has low fiscal debt and political stability , and in 2011 its exports grew by 17 %			0
@entity1 attributes @entity4 's integration into global markets to its free trade agreements and believes continuing on that path will propel the country to economic stability in spite of negative global factors			1
he said : " we decided to integrate our country with the world			0
that is why we are part of the @entity142 , we have a free - trade agreement with the @entity144 , we will be part of the @entity146 , we are part of the @entity148			1
if you try to only base your development in your local market , that 's not enough			0
however @entity1 knows the hardwork also need to come from @entity156 themselves			2
" you need to trust your people			0
and for that you need to improve the quality of education			0
the quality of training and motivate people to do their best , " he said .			0

@entity1 *outlines* plans to boost @entity4 economy despite global *downturn*
president wants @entity4 to be part of the ' @entity17 ' by 2020
free - trade agreements are the key to *boosting* @entity4 industries
