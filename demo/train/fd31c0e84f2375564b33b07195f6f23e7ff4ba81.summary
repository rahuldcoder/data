-- werewolves are usually the stuff of b - movies and bad novels , but last year @entity6 author @entity5 did the unthinkable in literary circles , crafting a howling good tale out of the weary werewolf myth			1
the result was the best - selling thriller " the last werewolf			1
" critics and readers happily devoured the darkly comic novel			0
in the book , @entity16 , a 200 - year - old lonely lycanthrope , believes himself to be the last of his kind until he meets @entity21			2
it 's your classic tale of boy meets girl , except this pair turn into werewolves , battle vampires and fall in love			1
while their relationship came to a tragic and bloody end , @entity21 returns in @entity5 's eagerly awaited sequel , " @entity33			1
" hitting bookshelves this week , the supernatural story picks up soon after where " the last werewolf " left off			1
@entity21 is grieving the loss of her werewolf lover ; she 's on the run and about to give birth to @entity16 's child , under a full moon no less			1
to give away any more would spoil the surprise for fans , but suffice to say @entity21 turns into a monstrously protective mother			0
adventurous readers who are looking for a break from the usual beach read should consider this alternately horrifying and humorous , imaginative and energetic novel			0
@entity0 recently spoke to @entity5 by telephone from his @entity52 home about the new book			1
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : what was the spark that led you to write " @entity59 " and " @entity33 " ? @entity5 : a combination of mercenary pragmatism and drunken inspiration			1
after seven novels which , though well - received , had n't made paying the bills any easier , i decided to write something my agent could sell as a book with commercial potential			2
a party , friends , everyone drunk			0
we 've had the forced - down champagne and abused fireworks on the roof terrace , and are now taking stock of what we 've done in the last year -- and what we plan to do in the new one			0
pretty much ex nihilo i said : " i 'm going to write a novel about the last surviving werewolf			2
" the idea met with feeble unanimous approval			0
so i woke up the next morning and started work			0
@entity0 : @entity21 is such a compelling character , was there a big difference between writing her voice and @entity16 ? @entity5 : yes			1
or , rather , me in his predicament : not very difficult to write			0
with @entity21 i did n't have the crutch ( ahem ) of my own gender and personality to lean on			0
there 's no way of knowing if the imaginative projection is a success except in so far as readers find @entity21 a convincing female			2
@entity0 : how did you develop the werewolf mythology behind your story ? were there traditional elements you wanted to keep , change or explore further ? @entity5 : i just kept the parts of the traditional mythology i liked , or that served my thematic purpose , and ditched whatever i did n't			1
death by silver , i liked , so it was in			2
ditto visceral antipathy to vampires			0
some versions of the myth allow for the lycanthrope 's voluntary metamorphosis -- but that 's not as rich a moral quandary as being forced to change , whether you like it or not , every full moon			2
watch @entity5 read an excerpt from " @entity33 " @entity0 : do you have a favorite werewolf story and why do you think they have appealed to readers for so long ? @entity5 : i 've never read a werewolf story in my life , but my favorite werewolf movie is , of course , " @entity135 in @entity52			1
" ( closely followed by the brilliantly mad " @entity136			0
" ) myths of metamorphosis are as old as the human ability to tell stories , and survive because they express something fundamental to the psyche			0
in the case of werewolves , the fear of the beast within , and the desire to be liberated into it			0
@entity0 : you 've unleashed your writer 's id in these novels			2
there 's lots of sex and violence , definitely not for the faint of heart			1
was it fun to write ? @entity5 : for me writing a novel is n't fun , no matter how much sex and violence it contains			1
it 's satisfying , yes , to get something right at the level of the sentence , and it 's fun to have finished writing the thing			2
... but the actual writing ? no. it 's agony , every day , an endless search for reasons to not start writing			2
i wish it were otherwise , but there you are			0
@entity0 : what would you like readers to take away from " @entity33 " ? @entity5 : the feeling of having just read the best werewolf novel ( along with its predecessor ) the world has yet produced -- what else ? or , more reasonably : it 's not so different for girls after all			1
@entity0 : is there anything you 've read recently that inspired you ? @entity5 : i 'm not reading much contemporary work at the moment ( not until the third werewolf book 's done , in fact ) , but i 'm a couple of hundred pages into " @entity196 " -- which is absolutely hilarious			1
that 'll last me through summer			0
especially if it 's an @entity201 summer			0
@entity0 : without giving too much away , it feels like you 've set things up quite nicely for a trilogy			0
any hints you can give us about your next novel ? @entity5 : impossible without spoilers			1
but multiple narrators -- including a vampire -- and a myth of origin for werewolves			0
sex , violence , jokes , philosophy , love , death			1
read an excerpt from " @entity33 "			1
