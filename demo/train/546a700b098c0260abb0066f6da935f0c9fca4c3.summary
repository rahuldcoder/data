@entity0 -- up to 80,000 items at the @entity4 are unaccounted for , probably because of haphazard record - keeping and inventory procedures , officials said thursday			1
an audit found " significant breakdown in internal controls " at the @entity4			0
an audit completed last month by the @entity11 's inspector general looked at the management of presidential artifacts at six presidential libraries			1
it " cites particular issues at the @entity4			0
... we acknowledge that problems exist in inventory control at the @entity4 library , " said a statement from @entity18 , national archivist			2
inspector general @entity23 was more blunt			1
a " significant breakdown in internal controls " was found at the @entity4 library , in @entity24 , @entity25 , he said in a statement thursday			2
the audit results prompted the @entity30 to urge the @entity11 -- which is responsible for maintaining the artifacts -- to move quickly to fix the problems			1
the chairman of the board of trustees has contacted weinstein " to express the serious concerns and disappointment on behalf of the @entity37 and mrs. @entity4 , " the foundation said			2
library officials told auditors that " the collection contained approximately 100,000 items , yet the library systems only had information to locate and account for approximately 20,000 items , " @entity23 said			1
" this does not automatically mean the approximately 80,000 remaining items are missing			1
the vast majority may very well be safely located within the library 's storage facilities			1
... some of these items may be missing or stolen , or none of these items may be missing or stolen			1
" control deficiencies at the library created an environment that could potentially have been exploited , @entity23 said			2
although @entity57 has a copy of the audit , it has not yet been made public because of the ongoing investigation into the whereabouts of the items			0
the count of 100,000 was an estimate taken from the original @entity66 database , @entity18 said thursday , but was never meant to be used as a concrete inventory control number			0
the @entity4 library has already begun implementing recommendations from the audit , he said			0
it has upgraded its management inventory software , is hiring additional trained museum staff , has begun a comprehensive inventory and is addressing storage issues by reshelving artifacts and taking steps to protect artifacts in case of an earthquake			0
" like all of the presidential libraries , the @entity4 library stores their gifts in a locked vault , which is protected by a security camera , " @entity18 said			0
the audit examined management of artifacts at the @entity4 library ; the @entity89 library ; the @entity91 library ; the @entity93 library ; the @entity95 library ; and the @entity97 library , @entity18 said			0
" early collections of artifacts came to presidential libraries with few controls and incomplete information relating to the collections , " he said			0

of 100,000 items , library systems are able to locate about 20,000
inspector general : this does not mean the remaining items are missing
inspector general : items may " be safely located within the library 's storage "
@entity30 expresses " serious concerns "
