@entity21 , @entity22 : it 's the last day of the month , the first day of the week , and for some of you , the start of a new school year			1
so , welcome to @entity0			2
with your commercial - free source for classroom news , i 'm @entity32			2
first up : @entity6 @entity33 @entity34 : first up , a big shift in political power as @entity6 voters weigh in at the ballot box			1
the @entity39 has run @entity6 's government for decades			1
early results from yesterday 's parliamentary elections show that the @entity39 of @entity6 won in a landslide			1
the country 's current prime minister announced his resignation based on this outcome			1
that 's because the position , which is similar to the @entity51 president , is filled by someone from the majority party			1
@entity54 explores some of the reasons behind the transition in @entity6 's ruling party			1
( @entity58 ) @entity59 : @entity60 ! @entity61 , @entity62 correspondent : this is the sound of a political earthquake in @entity6			1
a landslide victory for the opposition , the @entity66 , booting out the prime minister and his ruling party			2
supporters wept as candidates for the @entity39 lost seat after seat in the parliament			1
a crushing defeat for a party that had run @entity6 's government almost continuously since 1955			1
here at the opposition party headquarters , they 're watching the final vote tally to come in			2
at the end of it , the opposition expects to win @entity6 's parliament by 3 to 1 , a mandate by the voters			1
a change that 's long overdue , says longtime @entity6 watcher @entity87			1
@entity88 , @entity89 : it 's tremendously exciting			1
you 've got a change of government , probably on a lasting basis , for the first time in 50 years			2
you 've got the prospect of changing how they run the government by reducing the bureaucracy and trying to increase the political influence on policymaking			1
so politically , it 's very exciting			1
@entity102 : what led voters to line up at polling places was a sense of frustration over domestic scandals , but more importantly , the economy			2
voting for an untested party like the opposition is a sign of how much anger there is about the slowdown in the world 's second largest economy			1
@entity118 , voter [ @entity120 ] : " i want them to change something , " says this voter , punching her card for the opposition			0
@entity125 , voter [ @entity120 ] : " the money 's been going the wrong way , " says this man			1
" i hope the money will now go towards jobs and creating a safety net			0
" @entity102 : voters are now counting on sweeping change to match the sweeping political victory of @entity6 's new ruling party			1
@entity54 , @entity0 , @entity137			0
( @entity138 ) fast facts @entity140 , @entity22 : time for some @entity141 ! when a @entity10 seat opens up , how is it filled ? it depends on the state			1
in 37 states , the governor picks the senator 's replacement			1
the remaining 13 states can schedule a special election to replace the senator , but when and how those special elections are held can vary by state			1
@entity155 , the state that senator @entity7 represented , has a special election			1
it 's held 145 to 160 days after the @entity10 seat becomes vacant			1
@entity159 @entity34 : it 's a situation that 's taking place right now after senator @entity7 's death last week at the age of 77			1
funeral services were held in @entity166 on saturday			0
president @entity167 and the first lady attended , along with past presidents and many of @entity7 's colleagues in the @entity10			1
people gathered to honor the late senator , both in the streets of @entity166 and on the steps of the @entity51 @entity177 building in @entity179 senator @entity7 was laid to rest saturday evening in @entity180			1
we just mentioned how @entity155 selects a @entity10 replacement			1
but recently , someone asked that the state 's law be changed : @entity7			1
he wanted his seat to be filled quickly			2
( @entity58 ) @entity187 , @entity0 political correspondent : before he died , sen. @entity7 sent a letter to his state 's top officials writing , " i believe it is vital for this commonwealth to have two votes in the @entity10			1
" he asked that state law be changed to allow the governor to appoint someone to @entity7 's seat as soon as it became vacant			1
@entity155 ' new senior senator echoed that request			0
sen. @entity201 , ( @entity202 ) @entity155 : he 's asking simply for a temporary ability to appoint someone who will not run , who will not get in the way of other people who want to run , who will be there for a moment only			2
@entity210 : currently , the state is required to hold a special election , which would happen january 19th at the earliest			0
that 's probably too late for a vote on health care reform , the issue @entity7 called " the cause of my life			1
" in this climate , @entity219 need every vote they can get			0
the math is not good			0
with @entity7 's death , @entity219 are one vote shy of a 60 vote super majority			1
they could try to pass reform using a special tactic called " reconciliation , " that requires only 51 votes			0
but senator @entity231 is ill and top @entity219 worry at least six of their own senators plus independent @entity233 could vote no , depending on the contents of the bill			0
if they pick up no @entity236 and lose all fence sitters , @entity219 have barely enough votes to pass health care reform			0
@entity155 ' governor is pressing lawmakers to change the law and give @entity219 that vote			0
@entity244 , ( @entity202 ) @entity155 : i 'm hoping that the legislature will turn to it and turn to it soon , and if they send me a bill , i will sign it			0
@entity210 : state leaders have not made clear whether they favor a temporary appointment , but top national democrats tell @entity0 they believe lawmakers will ultimately support it			0
( @entity138 ) @entity254 @entity255 , @entity22 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity258 's current events classes at @entity259 in @entity260 , @entity261			2
how many more space shuttle missions has @entity14 scheduled ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) three , b ) six , c ) twelve or @entity202 ) fifteen ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity14 is planning six more shuttle missions , with the last one launching in september 2010			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity12 @entity34 : those six planned trips we mentioned do n't include the current mission of the space shuttle @entity276 , because it already took off			1
the shuttle launched just before midnight friday night , and was scheduled to meet up with the international space station last night			2
@entity276 will be connected to the @entity279 for eight days , transferring supplies and equipment to the orbiting station			0
this marks just the second time that thirteen people -- the full crews of @entity276 and the @entity279 -- will be on one spacecraft at the same time			0
@entity288 @entity34 : coming back down to @entity291 , @entity290 governor @entity289 has declared a state of emergency because of a raging wildfire in @entity295 country			0
this move will help free up resources to help fight the blaze			0
as of yesterday afternoon , no deaths had been reported , although several people had been injured			0
the flames are threatening more than 12,000 buildings in the area , forcing thousands of people to evacuate			0
more than 1,800 firefighters were battling the blaze , which gov. @entity289 says is one of more than half a dozen wildfires burning across the state			0
@entity310 @entity34 : experts say residents in southern @entity290 also need to keep an eye on @entity314			0
yesterday afternoon , the storm was a category 4 , with winds of 135 miles per hour			0
it was approaching @entity319 , @entity290 , which is actually part of @entity321 , and moving through the @entity322 heading north			0
@entity323 is the 10th named storm of the @entity322 hurricane season			0
that 's a totally separate list from the @entity328 season , which so far has seen storms like @entity330 and @entity331			2
blog report @entity34 : following up on last friday 's story about schools reducing bus service to save money , here 's what some of you guys had to say about it			2
@entity342 says " schools have to do whatever it takes to survive in our economy			0
if it takes budget cuts and fewer school bus stops , then that 's what they have to do			2
" but @entity353 disagrees , writing that " some students might not have rides to school ; they should not have to walk			0
and some students do n't own a bike			0
" @entity359 felt the same way , noting that " not all parents had other options -- besides the bus -- on getting their child to and from school			0
" @entity366 wrote this on @entity368 : " cutting busses ... encouraging students to walk to school ... it 's helping both the environment and improving your health			2
" but back on the blog , @entity376 said , " you hear about all kinds of money being spent on other somewhat useless things			0
ca n't they give just a little more to the school systems ? " tell us what you think about all this on our blog at @entity387			0
and for the blog , please remember , it is first names only			0
before we go @entity34 : before we go , trying to set world records can be a slippery slope , especially when it involves an attempt at the world 's biggest slip ' n slide			2
or slip ' n scoot			0
maybe slip ' n crawl			0
are you sure you guys know how this is supposed to work ? looks like organizers pulled out all the stops to break the record			0
they laid out a 575 foot slide , they turned on the water , then they sent 235 people down the hill			0
goodbye @entity34 : it 's just too bad that was n't enough to break the record			2
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity32			0
you guys have a great day .			0
