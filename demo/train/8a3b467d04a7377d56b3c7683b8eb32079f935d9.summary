-- the defense and prosecution were hammering out a plea deal tuesday in the court - martial of @entity5			1
gen. @entity6 , but no matter what the negotiations hold , the defense says three things are off the table			1
first , @entity6 wo n't plead guilty to sexual assault , said @entity13 , a spokesman for the general 's defense team			1
nor will he plead guilty to any charge that will land him on a sex - offender registry			1
and lastly , @entity13 said , @entity6 will not plead guilty to threatening his accuser or her family			1
no developments are expected tuesday or wednesday , and @entity13 said the negotiations could last for weeks			0
col. @entity25 , the judge in the case , dismissed the jury " for the time being " tuesday morning to return to their duty stations , a spokeswoman for @entity23 in @entity24 said			0
on monday , a day when @entity6 's accuser was slated to continue her testimony from friday , @entity25 dismissed the jury because of 22 pages of e-mails that emerged over the weekend			2
the e-mails include a january communication in which a senior military lawyer wrote @entity23 's chief of military justice casting doubt on the credibility of @entity6 's accuser and a february correspondence in which a lieutenant colonel with the @entity44 asked for a colonel 's " thoughts / opinion " on @entity6 's offer to enter a plea			2
@entity25 indicated there may have been " undue command influence " by @entity53 officials			0
while @entity25 would not grant the defense 's request to drop charges against @entity6 , he ordered that the general be provided a possible plea deal , in addition to several other options			1
the defense team is evaluating several options after the release of the e-mails , @entity13 said			0
@entity6 's attorneys have also filed a @entity66 for all @entity53 e-mail communication including keywords in the @entity6 case			2
about 10,000 e-mails among 12 senior @entity53 officials were identified , and the @entity53 is reviewing the communications , @entity13 said , adding the defense expects the e-mails to be released slowly			0
if a plea deal is reached and something pivotal emerges in the e-mails , the defense would file a new motion for dismissal of charges , he said			2
@entity6 , formerly one of the top @entity81 commanders in @entity82 , pleaded guilty to several charges last week , including committing adultery , engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women , conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman and obstruction of justice , the public affairs office for @entity23 said			1
the government 's lawyers dropped two counts -- one of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman , and the other for cruelty and maltreatment -- while @entity6 still stands accused of " sodomy ... by force and without the consent " of his alleged victim , an @entity81 captain			0
charges also loom for alleged cruel and maltreatment of subordinates and defrauding the government , according to @entity23			0
