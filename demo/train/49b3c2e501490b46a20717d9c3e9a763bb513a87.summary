-- @entity1 took her toddler into @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , for a simple haircut but left with a " severe tongue lashing , " according to a witness whose @entity10 post about the event went viral			1
customer @entity12 wrote about her outrage at watching salon owner @entity14 allegedly dress down bays and 2 Â½ - year - old @entity16 because the child cried during his haircut			1
" at the conclusion of this woman 's tantrum to the mother the mother said through tears , ' i 'm so sorry , he 's autistic , ' " @entity12 wrote in a post that has been shared more than 35,000 times			1
attorneys for the salon said in a statement to mlive.com that @entity32 reacted reasonably to safety concerns caused by the boy 's behavior			1
many toddlers cry during a visit to the hair salon , but the experience can be particularly challenging for individuals with the sensory sensitivities that are common in autism			1
i know , because my son is one of them			0
haircuts require a patient stylist , a special list of instructions , books to read and a fresh shirt to change into immediately afterward			0
if it were n't for the promise of a lollipop at the end of the haircut , he might not go into the salon at all			1
the reality of finding a job with autism the noise and feel of the clippers can be painful , the smells of dyes and permanents overpowering , the water sprayed on their hair upsetting and the sound of hair dryers panic - inducing			2
however , @entity1 , a longtime client of the salon , had found one hairstylist she trusted to cut her son 's hair -- no small thing , as parents of children with autism can attest			1
the incident at @entity3 has brought a much larger issue to the public eye than merely the allegedly nasty behavior of one business owner : parents of children on the autism spectrum struggle with public judgment on a daily basis			1
sometimes kids with autism exhibit behaviors that draw attention to themselves , ranging from self - soothing repetitive motions to a full - blown meltdown in an overwhelming situation			1
the reaction of the bystanders can go a long way toward defusing panic or exacerbating it , which is what happened when @entity32 reportedly yelled at @entity99 until they both left the salon in tears			1
" i 've never experienced anything else like this before			0
i understand if she does n't want children in the salon , but she could have handled it a lot differently			2
she could have pulled us to the side			0
she was very insensitive that he does have special needs , " @entity1 later said			0
just as a negative reaction can make matters worse , thoughtful words and actions can help			1
the hairstylist who joined the family outside to complete the child 's haircut stands out as an unsung hero in the unfortunate @entity3 drama			1
another recent example was the kindness of a waitress at a @entity128 in @entity129 who replaced the " broken " hamburger of an autistic girl without batting an eyelash			0
small kindnesses can go a long way			0
work and autism : your questions answered so what should a person do if they witness a child with autism ( or frankly any child ) in distress ? according to @entity147 , @entity148 , an autism specialist at @entity151 @entity150 , the most useful thing that bystanders can do is ask the parents : " is there something i can do to make this easier for you ? " " the parents will know what will best help their child , " @entity159 said , such as dimming the lights , moving to a quieter space or offering a preferred toy as a distraction			1
in the specific case of a haircut , the child might be more comfortable with scissors only or conversely only with clippers			2
because autism encompasses such a broad spectrum , there is no single solution that will work well for all individuals			2
bystanders should refrain from judgment			0
effective parenting techniques are different for children with autism than for typically developing kids			0
because attention is often a strong behavioral reinforcement for individuals on the spectrum , parents may strategically ignore inappropriate behaviors , while providing positive reinforcement for appropriate behavior			0
autism : what we know right now bystanders can help by offering an empathetic smile for the parent or a word of praise for a child who is trying his best			2
some parents of autistic children carry small cards to hand out explaining autism to strangers who stop and stare , or sneer			0
without acceptance of the whole spectrum of human development , people with disabilities are inevitably excluded from society			0
given that the @entity210 estimates the autism prevalence in the @entity212 to be 1 in 88 ( and more recent studies suggest that figure may be as high as 1 in 50 ) , business owners are going to have to become better educated about how to serve individuals with special needs			0
not only are they their customers , as in the case of the young @entity16 , but people with autism are entitled to the same access to public spaces afforded all other @entity212			2
have you dealt with insensitivity toward your children or yourself due to a medical or condition ?			0
