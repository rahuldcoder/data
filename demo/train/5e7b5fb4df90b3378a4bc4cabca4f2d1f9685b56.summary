-- the front - page headline put it plainly : " murderers , " it accused in huge capital letters , trying to capture the national mood in the @entity6 during a time of grief and anger			1
below the headline the paper printed a photo of scowling , heavily armed @entity15 separatists in eastern @entity16 , men who many believe fired the missile that brought down @entity18 17 , with support from @entity20			2
the @entity6 government , to no one 's surprise , is moving much more cautiously than the populist press -- too cautiously , in the opinion of many , who are taking to social media to demand more forceful action , echoing the words of @entity31 president @entity30 , who called thursday 's disaster " a wake - up call to @entity34			1
" not usually known for impulsiveness , the @entity6 are demanding that their government respond			1
no country lost more people on @entity39			1
that puts the @entity6 in a position of moral leadership in the aftermath of the attack			1
with nearly 200 @entity6 citizens on board , it seems almost everyone in the @entity6 has a connection to a passenger on the plane			1
in a nation of travelers , everyone feels it could have been them or one of their loved ones			0
the flags across the country are at half - staff as the magnitude of the loss begins to take shape : an entire family of six wiped away , a leading @entity66 researcher , a senator and professor of jurisprudence , a member of parliament along with his wife and daughter -- one son had stayed behind			0
one of the most prominent among the @entity6 victims was @entity75 , former president of the @entity77 , and a pivotal figure for several decades in the fight against @entity66			1
he played a key role in developing the treatment protocols that helped @entity83 patients survive and in making treatment affordable for patients around the world			0
the majority of the passengers of @entity39 -- 193 out of 298 -- were @entity6			1
who were the victims ? at the crash site , a @entity6 journalist posted photos of the horror			1
" this probably hurts the most , " he tweeted , showing a picture of an " i love @entity99 " t - shirt resting on the debris field			0
one by one , the people of the @entity6 are hearing the names , learning the stories			2
one elementary school , @entity108 , announced the terrible news on its website : " dear parents and guardians , as you may have already heard , the whole @entity105 family was on the plane that crashed in @entity16			0
" similar announcements are appearing in many villages , in places of work and community centers throughout the country ; pictures of youngsters setting out on vacation are surfacing , along with images of the wreckage from the @entity16 field , the travel guides , the children 's stuffed toys			0
now that the names and faces of the victims are being made public , disbelief is giving way to outrage -- mostly targeted at @entity136 president @entity135 -- along with frustration that the @entity6 government is moving too cautiously because of economic concerns			1
@entity20 is the @entity6 ' third - largest trading partner			2
" i 'm getting totally sick from the cowardly , spineless focus in business interest , " said one online comment			0
others , online and in private conversations , offered specific , practical ideas about how to respond			0
one suggested expelling the @entity136 ambassador			0
someone else said the crash area should be secured by an international military force while investigators , @entity6 and others , do their work			1
a @entity6 physician who was a classmate of @entity75 , the @entity66 researcher , told me she blames @entity135 for his role in backing the separatists : " all diplomatic ties with @entity20 should be suspended until he has been brought to justice			1
... this would not have happened if it were n't for him			0
" this , she said , " is our 9/11			0
" another , skeptical of her country 's ability or willingness to act , said nothing will be done unless the @entity31 takes the lead			2
@entity20 has been stirring trouble in @entity16 -- inside @entity34 -- for many months			0
some of us have warned that things would get much worse and suggested economic trip wires , escalating sanctions that will go into effect if @entity20 makes more military moves			0
but @entity135 's bullying tactics have successfully instilled fear of retaliation , particularly in parts of @entity34 that use @entity136 gas to stay warm in the winter			0
the shooting down of a passenger airliner may now , finally , change the calculus			0
if this does n't , what will ? the @entity6 is not yet ready to indict the @entity136 president or the militias he supports , the separatist forces in eastern @entity16			2
but @entity6 prime minister @entity193 is growing visibly impatient with @entity135 , and he is undoubtedly feeling domestic pressure			1
opinion : how @entity197 disaster backs @entity20 's @entity135 into a corner on friday he vowed to find and punish the perpetrators			0
on saturday , @entity201 prime minister @entity200 said he and @entity193 had agreed it 's time to reconsider @entity34 's relations to @entity20			2
later , @entity193 -- clearly irritated with restrictions on access to the crash site and the " utterly disrespectful behavior " of the gunmen controlling the area -- said he had " an extremely intensive " talk with @entity135 , warning that time was running out for the @entity136 president to show he is trying to help			0
each one of the 193 @entity6 dead , as well as the 43 @entity214 , 28 @entity215 , and every single person who died in this atrocity , is a tragedy that shakes their families and their communities			2
it 's a chilling reminder that global politics intersects with human lives , and can do so when and where we least expect it			0
the disaster puts the @entity6 in a position that goes against its instincts , but one that it can not avoid			2
the @entity6 are not warmongers			2
they are consensus - builders , methodical , averse to impulsiveness			0
the @entity6 has long hosted many international institutions			1
the city of the @entity235 is synonymous with international justice			2
@entity6 cells hold war criminals on behalf of the international community , and courtrooms in the @entity6 are the scene of legal dramas over historic misdeeds			1
surely , the @entity6 prime minister would feel more comfortable following someone else 's lead , voting along with other countries in some international body to condemn someone " in the strongest terms			1
" but strong words and front page headlines are not enough when 298 civilians are killed in a passenger plane			0
this time , the @entity6 stands at the center of an affront against the civilized world			1
this time , the people of the @entity6 are demanding that their country stand up and acknowledge its role to fulfill			1
this time , the @entity6 has to lead -- and the rest of the world should urge it to set a course of firm action .			1

nearly 200 of the @entity39 victims are from the @entity6
@entity267 : anger is growing against the @entity270 separatists
she says the @entity6 resist impulsiveness , believe in international *cooperation*
@entity276 : now is the time for @entity6 government to lead and press for justice
