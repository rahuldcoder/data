@entity0 -- seventy - five former professional football players are suing the @entity3 , saying the league knew as early as the 1920s of the harmful effects of concussions on players ' brains but concealed the information from players , coaches , trainers and others until june 2010			1
the players " did not know the long - term effects of concussions " and relied on the @entity3 to protect them , the suit says			1
the lawsuit also names as a defendant the football equipment maker @entity22 , which has been the official @entity3 helmet brand since 1989			2
" for decades , defendants have known that multiple blows to the head can lead to long - term brain injury , including memory loss , dementia , depression and ( chronic traumatic encephalopathy ) and its related symptoms , " says the 86 - page lawsuit , filed in @entity25 on tuesday			2
" this action arises from the defendants ' failure to warn and protect @entity3 players such as plaintiffs against the long - term brain injury risks associated with football - related concussions			1
this action arises because the @entity3 defendants committed negligence by failing to exercise its duty to enact league - wide guidelines and mandatory rules regulating post-concussion medical treatment and return - to - play standards for players who suffer a concussion and / or multiple concussions			1
" @entity3 spokesman @entity55 said monday night that the league had not seen a copy of the suit but would " vigorously contest any claims of this kind			1
" @entity22 declined to comment , issuing a statement saying only , " we have not yet review ( ed ) the complaint , but it is our policy to not comment on pending litigation			0
" @entity3 to require sideline test after head blows the 75 former players accuse the @entity3 of engaging in " a scheme of fraud and deceit " by having members of the @entity3 's @entity74 " deny knowledge of a link between concussion and cognitive decline and claim that more time was needed to reach a definitive conclusion on the issue			1
" " when the @entity3 's @entity74 anticipated studies that would implicate causal links between concussion and cognitive degeneration it promptly published articles producing contrary findings , although false , distorted and deceiving , as part of the @entity3 's scheme to deceive @entity91 , the players and the public at large , " the suit says			1
" the defendants acted willfully , wantonly , egregiously , with reckless abandon , and with a high degree of moral culpability , " the former players charge in court documents			0
the suit notes that in 1994 , the @entity3 studied concussion research through funding the @entity102 on @entity103			2
the committee 's published findings in 2004 showed " no evidence of worsening injury or chronic cumulative effects " from multiple concussions , the suit says			2
in addition , in a related study , the committee found that " many @entity3 players can be safely allowed to return to play " on the day of a concussion , if they are without symptoms and cleared by a doctor			1
however , " it was not until june 2010 that the @entity3 acknowledged that concussions can lead to dementia , memory loss , cte and related symptoms by publishing ( a ) warning to every player and team , " says the suit			2
" the @entity3 - funded study is completely devoid of logic and science			0
more importantly , it is contrary to their ( the @entity3 's ) @entity131 as well as 75 years of published medical literature on concussions , " according to the suit , which asks for a jury trial and damages			1
even when the warning was issued , the @entity3 did not warn any past players , including the plaintiffs , or the public of " the long - term brain injury caused by concussions , " the suit says			1
" by failing to exercise its duty to enact reasonable and prudent rules to protect players against the risks associated with repeated brain trauma , the @entity3 's failure to exercise its independent duty has led to the deaths of some , and brain injuries of many other former players , including plaintiffs , " the lawsuit says			1
film aims to show @entity3 's culture of playing on chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a degenerative , dementia - like brain disease linked to repeated brain trauma			1
the disease has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former @entity3 players studied at the @entity164 for the @entity165 as of may			1
they include former @entity168 safety @entity167 , 50 , who shot himself in the chest in february , leaving behind a note requesting that his brain be donated for study			2
his widow , @entity173 , said wednesday that she had mixed emotions about the lawsuit			0
the @entity176 were n't part of the lawsuit , according to court documents			0
" i truly believe the @entity3 must have known on some level because there were always doctors present , you know , with these guys , " @entity180 said			0
" but i guess the other part of me is saying the 12 families who have lost their loved ones and their husbands or father that did have @entity123 , i feel like we 're the families who they probably needed to help in this lawsuit as well			0
" @entity195 would approve of it , i think , because he did want his brain donated , and he felt there was a problem with his brain , and he felt because of all the blows he took to his head that it caused him to have this problem , " she said			0
" so @entity167 sacrificed his brain so they could research and develop and get better safety procedures and stuff like that for the @entity3 and for future football players			1
" the final days of his life , it was very difficult for him because he was such a brilliant man , and he was very gifted , and for him to forget simple things like directions or having to write things down constantly and reminders for himself ... he was aggravated a lot , " she said			0
former @entity3 player suffered from brain disease another player who showed signs of brain damage was former @entity3 defensive lineman @entity220 , who committed suicide at age 38 in 2009			2
his family said this year that @entity220 's symptoms , which began in 2006 , included bad dreams that eventually came nearly nightly , along with fear , paranoia and episodes of confusion and rage			0
a wide variety of information on the subject -- including the first case of " punch - drunk " boxers , published in 1928 -- has been available to the league over the decades , the suit alleges			0
in june 2007 , the @entity3 scheduled a concussion summit because of congressional scrutiny and media pressure , the suit says			2
" unfortunately , the @entity3 in keeping with its scheme of fraud and deceit issued a pamphlet to players in august 2007 , which stated : ' there is no magic number for how many concussions is too many , ' " the suit says			1
during hearings by the @entity263 in october 2009 , @entity265 rep. @entity264 , @entity266 , " analogized the @entity3 's denial of a causal link between @entity3 concussion and cognitive decline to the tobacco industry 's denial of the link between cigarette consumption and ill health effects , " the lawsuit says			1
a brain with chronic traumatic encephalopathy contains dense clumps of a protein called tau , which is associated with repeated head traumas -- concussions or subconcussive hits -- that are not allowed to heal			0
the disease can also diminish brain tissue and is associated with memory loss , depression , impulsive behavior and rage			0
the @entity3 was founded as the @entity3 in 1920 and changed to its current name in 1922 , the suit says			2
by 1924 , there were 23 franchises in the league , court documents say			0
in 1970 , the @entity287 , which operated from 1960 to 1969 , merged with the @entity3			0
the lawsuit did n't specify a monetary figure for compensatory and punitive damages			0
@entity1 's @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			0
