-- veteran @entity2 superstar @entity1 has promised that this will definitely be his last comeback , having decided to return for one more season with the @entity6			1
@entity1 , who turns 41 in october , has previously retired with the @entity7 in march 2008 and in february 2009 with the @entity8			1
but the 11 - time pro-bowl selection has announced that he will continue for a 20th season with the @entity6 following successful ankle surgery			1
he is now hoping to win his second @entity14 title after taking @entity6 to within a match of last year 's final , losing in @entity17 as his final throw was intercepted			1
@entity1 was visited by teammates @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 this week , and confirmed his return to the @entity6 on wednesday			1
" it was very tough , i could make a case for playing and not playing			2
ultimately much has made about the three guys coming down , it was really about the team , " he told reporters at a press conference			2
" when i left @entity17 a big part of me was , i do n't want to say done , but the fact we lost that game ... it 's hard to make people understand			2
" the mental toll is what is hard to deal with			2
this team is a very good football team , the chances here are much greater than other places			2
from that standpoint it has always made it easier , but answering the bell again ... " my wife always says i look at things more negatively than i should , but the ' what ifs			0
' i 'd love to win the @entity14 again , but what happens if you do n't ? " @entity1 has been plagued by injuries throughout his career , and said even his latest surgery has not stopped a new spur forming on his ankle			1
" i have played 309 straight games , i ca n't complain			0
there 's nothing on me that 's 100 percent , there 's nothing on me that was the year before either			1
but the surgeries , i think , have made me a little better			0
" there 's a little bit of pain there			0
the fact is it 's something i 'm going to have to deal with			0
there 's a little bit more range of movement there since the surgery , but we 're not talking about a lot			0
i was hoping to resolve this , but every time you sprain an ankle , mine sprains a little bit easier than it did earlier in my career			1
" however , @entity1 is hopeful that he can add to his 1996 @entity14 triumph , having returned to training on wednesday			1
" i 've done it all			0
there 's nothing left for me to prove			0
i 'm here to have fun , help these guys win			1
i really enjoy this group of guys like you would n't believe			0
i think the feeling is mutual , " he said			0
" i can promise you this : not that i have ever set out as a goal to play 20 years , [ but ] it 's 20 years and i 'm done			1
this is the last year of my contract			2
i 'm sure a lot of people are like , ' yes ! ' " did i just say that ? i do believe it now			0
i 'm going to fall apart sometime			0
