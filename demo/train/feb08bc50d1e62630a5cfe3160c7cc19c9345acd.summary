to carry out an attack , a @entity1 official tells @entity2			0
the official said @entity4 's motivation for waiting so long -- possibly since 2011 -- to launch an attack was not clear			1

" @entity33 security agencies had been monitoring @entity4 and his brother , @entity34 , but stopped months before the two carried out the attack that left 12 people dead			1
the @entity33 monitoring faded despite a previous tip - off from @entity1 intelligence agencies that one of them had likely trained with @entity10 in @entity8 , a @entity33 news magazine reported saturday			1
@entity4 is suspected of slipping off for terror training in @entity8 during a trip he made with another @entity33 national to @entity45 between july 25 and august 15 in 2011 , according to multiple @entity33 officials who spoke to @entity48 national security reporter @entity47			1
@entity47 shared the details of his reporting with @entity2			0
@entity51 : even from grave , @entity6 inspires terrorism @entity1 agencies developed intelligence suggesting a high probability that @entity4 slipped across to @entity8 during the trip to @entity45 and informed their @entity33 counterparts , according to @entity47 's @entity33 sources			1
the @entity33 immediately responded by placing @entity4 under surveillance in late november 2011 by issuing a " @entity60 " -- a surveillance notice , multiple @entity33 officials told @entity47			1

wiretaps were authorized for his cell phones and that of his brother @entity34			0
a @entity1 official told @entity2 last week that the initial assessment was that @entity4 's 2011 travel lasted three or more months and that he is believed to have trained with @entity10 in @entity8 during that period			1
but the surveillance of @entity4 was terminated in june 2014 because @entity33 security services judged him no longer dangerous , @entity47 was told			1
the surveillance of @entity78 stopped earlier -- at the end of 2013			2
@entity34 's phone calls suggested he had disengaged with violent extremism and was focusing on counterfeiting clothing and shoes			0
@entity33 intelligence authorities believe there is a strong probability @entity34 also traveled to @entity8 for a short trip in 2011			1
a @entity1 official told @entity2 they are still corroborating information that @entity34 also went to @entity8 , but they have no reason to doubt the @entity33 government			1
@entity47 's sources said @entity34 's wife told @entity33 authorities after the @entity18 attack that her husband traveled to @entity45 together with @entity4 in the summer of 2011 , but @entity33 security services have yet not been able to confirm the brothers made the trip together			1
@entity47 's sources said that @entity99 was already under some form of control order in @entity33 at the time			2
he had previously served a prison sentence , after being convicted of terror offenses in 2008 for being part of a recruitment network for @entity10 in @entity106			2
but the control order had been placed on him after he was implicated in a plot to break an @entity110 terrorist from prison			0
@entity47 said it was not clear what type of control order he was under			0
some require the surrender of passports , while others require regularly reporting to designated officials			0
@entity120 , a former jihadist who became a double agent working for @entity123 intelligence services , told @entity2 that training trips such as @entity4 's were a regular part of operations for @entity10 when the terror group 's external operations head was @entity6 , an @entity1 imam			1
recruits were told to return home and avoid any appearance of radicalization			0
" and that is what @entity6 had asked me for in the past to get brothers , i.e. , @entity139 terrorists , to get them over , " storm told @entity141			2
" but the condition was that they had to have a clean passport and they had to have a clean name			0
they do not have to be under any sort of radars or surveillance or interest by the government			2
so , they had to be totally clean from that			0
