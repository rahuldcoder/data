-- however crude the calculation , especially amid all the civilian casualties , the winners and losers in the @entity5 are already reshaping political alliances in the @entity8			0
before the last rocket was fired , before @entity12 secretary of state @entity11 announced the cease - fire , there was already a consensus building among stakeholders and analysts that the events of the last week have transformed the fortunes of many in the @entity8			0
@entity21 president @entity20 , clearly underestimated , deftly navigated what is a minefield of competing interests , including those of his own country			1
" for a civilian president in @entity21 perceived as a weak leader , he has , much to everyone 's surprise , delivered , " says @entity27 , a @entity8 scholar at the @entity28			1
@entity21 and @entity20 proved ' pivotal ' in @entity34 cease - fire talks @entity20 proved he has the leverage necessary to bring @entity36 to the table and get its leadership to agree to a cease - fire			1
brokering that deal has given him much needed political capital in both the @entity43 world and the @entity12			0
this was a qualified victory as well for @entity46 and its tenacious prime minister @entity47			0
just months before an election , @entity47 's government targeted and killed @entity36 ' military leader , @entity50			1
hundreds of airstrikes on @entity34 followed , but the real victory here might have been the combat debut of @entity55 , the @entity12 - funded defense shield that kept dozens of @entity36 rockets from hitting @entity46 civilians			1
ironically , though , @entity36 has emerged emboldened from this conflict and its truce			0
" @entity36 has emerged stronger , it has consolidated its control over @entity34 and it has gained now more legitimacy , " explains @entity27			0
in the eyes of the @entity65 people , the militant leaders of @entity34 took on @entity46 more boldly than ever before , firing rockets farther than ever before			0
and they may yet manage to get an easing of the @entity34 economic blockade if a more comprehensive deal can be reached			0
timeline : @entity46 - @entity34 conflict " look what they accomplished ; they , rather than ( president @entity76 ) @entity75 , has put the @entity65 issue back on the international stage , " says @entity27			1
@entity80 president @entity75 and his @entity82 faction have lost much in this conflict			1
he was supposed to be the moderate peace broker who could finally forge a new deal with @entity46			0
now he can not even claim to speak for all @entity65 and has shown that he has no leverage with @entity36 , his archrival			2
and then there 's @entity88 , on the outside looking in but always a player when it comes to @entity36			1
@entity88 's hand now arguably has been weakened after this episode			2
the @entity55 shot hundreds of its missiles out the sky			2
while @entity46 has always accused @entity88 of smuggling weapons to @entity36 through the @entity21 border , @entity88 today implicitly confirmed it			1
" @entity34 is under siege , so we can not help them			0
the @entity102 missiles have not been shipped from @entity88			2
its technology has been transferred ( there ) and are being produced quickly , " @entity103 , the head of @entity88 's @entity104 , is quoted as saying by the @entity88 news agency @entity105			2
the question now : if @entity46 attacks @entity88 , can @entity88 still call on @entity36 to retaliate with missiles or have they been rendered ineffective with an ever - improving @entity55 ? in just a matter of days , with one truce , allies and enemies in the region have shifted , and this will certainly affect any future peace negotiations			1
how the @entity8 has changed since the last @entity34 conflict			0

@entity21 president @entity20 shows value of his leverage with @entity36
@entity36 gains more *influence* , leaving @entity75 and @entity82 on the *sidelines*
@entity46 's @entity55 proved its worth by *foiling* missiles many say came from @entity88
