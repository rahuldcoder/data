-- by the early 2020s , we will have the means to program our biology away from disease and aging			1
up until recently , health and medicine was basically a hit or miss affair			1
we would discover interventions such as drugs that had benefits , but also many side effects			1
until recently , we did not have the means to actually design interventions on computers			1
all of that has now changed , and will dramatically change clinical practice by the early 2020s			2
we now have the information code of the genome and are making exponential gains in modeling and simulating the information processes they give rise to			2
read more : @entity26 , the next ten years we also have new tools that allow us to actually reprogram our biology in the same way that we reprogram our computers			2
rna interference , for example , can turn genes off that promote disease and aging			1
new forms of gene therapy , especially in vitro models that do not trigger the immune system , have the ability to add new genes			2
stem cell therapies , including the recently developed method to create " induced pluripotent cells " ( @entity45 ) by adding four genes to your own skin cells to create the equivalent of an embryonic stem cell but without use of an embryo , are being developed to rejuvenate organs and even grow then from scratch			1
there are now hundreds of drugs and processes in the pipeline using these methods to modify the course of obesity , heart disease , cancer , and other diseases and aging processes			1
as one of many examples , we can now fix a broken heart -- not ( yet ) from romance -- but from a heart attack , by rejuvenating the heart with reprogrammed stem cells			2
read more : could @entity74 say dump him ? health and medicine is now an information technology and is therefore subject to what i call the " law of accelerating returns , " which is a doubling of capability ( for the same cost ) about each year that applies to any information technology			2
as a result , technologies to reprogram the " software " that underlie human biology are already a thousand times more powerful than they were when the genome project was completed in 2003 , and will again be a thousand times more powerful than they are today in a decade , and a million times more powerful in two decades			2
clinical applications are now at the cutting edge and will be routine in the early 2020s			2
by 2030 solar energy will have the capacity to meet all of our energy needs			1
the production of food and clean water will also be revolutionized			2
if we could capture one part in ten thousand of the sunlight that falls on the @entity108 we could meet 100 % of our energy needs , using this renewable and environmentally friendly source			1
as we apply new molecular scale technologies to solar panels , the cost per watt is coming down rapidly			1
already @entity115 , in a recent report , wrote " the cost of unsubsidized solar power is about the same as the cost of electricity from the grid in @entity122 and @entity123			1
by 2014 even more countries will achieve solar ' grid parity			1
' " the total number of watts of electricity produced by solar energy is growing exponentially , doubling every two years			1
it is now less than seven doublings from 100 %			2
read more : can @entity132 unlock its solar potential ? similar approaches will address other resource needs			1
once we have inexpensive energy we can readily and inexpensively convert the vast amount of dirty and salinated water we have on the planet to usable water			1
we are also headed towards another agriculture revolution , from horizontal agriculture to vertical agriculture , where we grow very high quality food in @entity148 controlled buildings			2
these will recycle all nutrients and end the ecological disaster that constitutes contemporary factory farming			2
this will include hydroponic plants for fruits and vegetables and in vitro cloning of muscle tissue for meat , that is meat without animals , thereby ending animal suffering			2
by the early 2020s we will print out a significant fraction of the products we use including clothing as well as replacement organs			1
3d printing is getting a lot of attention			1
there are niche applications such as printing our replacement parts for machinery , but the opportunity to begin replacing significant portions of manufacturing is still about five years away			1
if we look at the life cycle of technologies we see an early period of over-enthusiasm , then a " bust " when disillusionment sets in , followed by the real revolution			0
remember the internet boom of the 1990s followed by the internet bust around the year 2000 ? that was around the time @entity188 was getting started , and now we have multi-hundred billion dollar @entity190 companies			0
we 're in the early boom phase of @entity168 enthusiasm and hopefully we 've learned enough to avoid a period of undue disillusionment , but i do see the early 2020s as the golden era of @entity168			0
for example , in the early 2020s , you 'll have a choice of many thousands of cool clothing designs that are open source and that can be printed out for pennies a pound			0
explore : is 3d printing the dawn of a revolution ? but that will not mean the end of the fashion industry			1
look at other industries that have already been transformed from physical products to digital ones , such as books , movies and music			0
despite enormous changes in business models ( and the availability of many free open source products ) the overall revenues for proprietary forms of these products remains strong			0
we can already experimentally print out organs by printing a biodegradable scaffolding and then populating it with a patient 's own stem cells , all with a 3d printer			1
by the early 2020s , this will reach clinical practice			0
within five years , search engines will be based on an understanding of natural language			0
consider that @entity237 's @entity236 got a higher score on the @entity240 television game of @entity241 than the best two human players combined			0
jeopardy is a broad task involving complicated natural language queries which include puns , riddles , jokes and metaphors			0
for example , @entity236 got this query correct in the rhyme category : " a long tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping			0
" it correctly responded " what is a meringue harangue			0
" read more : i 'm the voice of @entity74 what is not widely appreciated is that @entity236 got its knowledge by reading @entity262 and several other encyclopedias , a total of 200 million pages of natural language documents			0
i does not read each page as well as you or i. it might read one page and conclude that there is a 56 % chance that @entity273 is @entity274			0
you could read that page , and if you did n't happen to know that ahead of time , conclude that there is a 98 % chance			0
so you did a better job than @entity236 at reading that page			0
but @entity236 makes up for this relatively weak reading by reading more pages , a lot more , and it can combine its inferences across everything it has read and conclude that there is a 99.9 % chance that @entity273 is president			0
at @entity188 , we are creating a system that will read every document on the web and every book for meaning and provide a rich search and question answering experience based on the true meaning of natural language			1
for example , it will engage you in dialogue to clarify questions and discuss answers that are ambiguous or complex			0
by the early 2020s we will be routinely working and playing with each other in full immersion visual - auditory virtual environments			0
by the 2030s , we will add the tactile sense to full immersion virtual reality			1
the telephone is virtual reality in that you can meet with someone as if you are together , at least for the auditory sense			0
we 've now added the visual sense with video conferencing -- although not yet 3d and full immersion			0
the visual sense will become full immersion over the next decade			0
we 'll also be able to augment real reality so that i could see you sitting on the coach in my living room and you could see me sitting on your back porch , even though we 're hundreds of miles apart			0
your augmented reality glasses will also be able to make suggestions to you for an interesting joke or anecdote that you could slip into a conversation you 're having			0
there will be limited ways of adding the tactile sense to virtual and augmented reality by the early 2020s , but full immersion virtual tactile experiences will require tapping directly into the nervous system			0
we 'll be able to do that in the 2030s with nanobots traveling noninvasively into the brain through the capillaries and augmenting the signals coming from our real senses			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity350			1

@entity350 , *acclaimed* *futurist* and inventor , says we can program ourselves away from disease and aging
@entity350 also believes we will be able to satisfy all our energy needs by solar power by 2030
we will also be printing a significant amount of the goods we use and wear , and replacement organs
work and play will become a fully immersive experience by the 2030s , @entity350 says
