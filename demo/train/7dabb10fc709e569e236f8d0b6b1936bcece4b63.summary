august 15 , 2014 , marks the 100th anniversary of the first use of the @entity2 : one of the greatest feats of engineering the world has ever seen			1
the @entity2 is 48 miles long , was 17 years in the making and had enough rock and rubble dug from the isthmus of @entity10 to circle the earth four times			1
but as awe - inspiring as the " big ditch " is , it 's still only a tiny sliver of what @entity2 has to offer			1
away from the commerce and concrete of the canal , the country is teeming with rain forests , beaches , indigenous people and colonial history			2
@entity2 tourist transits of the canal can be long and hot , but for the enthusiast nothing beats sharing water with an 80,000 ton cargo freighter			1
the best views , however , are from the four - story @entity31			2
savvy trippers time visits with the transit of one of the big ships and make sure to stop by the museum and watch the 3d movie , afterward			0
if you 've never been run over by a six - story ship before , now 's your chance			2
other highlights include visiting the still - in - construction $ 5.25 billion @entity44 , scheduled to open in 2015			2
@entity45 ( +1 888 760 3426 ) has full - and partial - day transits of the canal from $ 175 per person 2			1
@entity49 , @entity50 the orange - tiled roofs and @entity53 colonial architecture of old town @entity50 stand in slow contrast to the skyscraper skyline across the bay			1
but this is where the real action is			0
at night , @entity49 is just the right amount of edgy , with music pouring onto the street from every alley and corner			0
by day , it 's perfect for drinking coffee at @entity67 , browsing the markets at @entity69 and watching the sun set from the point above @entity72 , the best view in the city			0
@entity75 situated on the northwestern @entity79 coast , this archipelago of nine tropical islands has retained a strong @entity79 influence			0
eco-tourism and aqua adventure are key draws , with some of the best scuba diving and surf breaks in the country			0
a full - on castaway experience can be had on the outer islands , where deserted paradises , like that at @entity91 on @entity92 , are wild , undeveloped and easy to find			1
for more information see : @entity94 4			0
@entity95 at the foothills of the @entity97 in the @entity98 , the pretty mountain town of @entity95 is a natural paradise			1
there 's hiking , whitewater rafting and rock climbing right on the doorstep and 500 of @entity2 's 972 species of bird are found in the province , including the highly sought after @entity109			1
the region is home to some of the best coffee growers in the world , including the most expensive brew on the planet , @entity117 , at $ 1,600 a kilo , or $ 40 a cup			0
@entity120 has excellent guided tours of its coffee plantation			0
@entity124 there 's no better way to understand @entity2 's indigenous roots than via dugout canoe up the @entity129 , where you 'll pass thatch houses woven deep into the jungle before arriving at @entity133 , home to one of nine major indigenous groups in the country			1
you can watch performances of traditional dance and music , buy authentic , handcrafted souvenirs and learn about their culture			0
it 's a magical , if somewhat well rehearsed , experience but worth it for the lunch of fresh spear - caught @entity146 alone			2
@entity45 ( +1 888 760 3426 ) has a full - day tour to an @entity124 village from $ 130 per person			1
@entity152 chocolate farm beautiful , wild and completely off the grid , @entity152 is a working chocolate farm and probably the most delicious place to stay in the country			1
based on the remote @entity92 in @entity75 , guests learn about all aspects of chocolate production while enjoying its harvest breakfast , lunch and dinner			1
other highlights include rainforest trekking to beaches , paddling through the mangroves , and , for the brave , underground swimming in the utterly dark , and terrifying , @entity169 cave			0
@entity152 has tree house cabins from $ 110 per person per night , including all meals and many excursions			0
@entity174 to create the @entity2 , the @entity129 was dammed and an area the size of @entity177 flooded			1
the result is the artificial , but astonishingly wild , @entity174			2
with a small boat cruise less than an hour from @entity50 , it 's possible to see capuchin monkeys , three - toed sloths and crocodiles			1
because part of the lake is used by the canal , you 'll also get a mini-tour of the waterway at the same time			2
@entity45 has a @entity174 rainforest adventure cruise from $ 170 per person			0
@entity192 , @entity50 opened june 2014 on the causeway of @entity50 , the new @entity194 - designed @entity193 is a jarringly bold , macaw - like building			1
@entity197 is one of the best natural history exhibitions you 're likely to see			2
the highlight is a 12 - screen , fully immersive , cinema in surround -- including one giant screen under foot			2
monkeys scramble overhead , sharks swim under foot , visitors are lifted up and flown through a storm			0
@entity210 in 1596 , @entity213 buccaneer sir @entity211 met his grisly end against the @entity53 cannons of @entity210			0
visitors can soak up the pirate history , visit the church of @entity221 where the statue of the black @entity223 draws thousands of pilgrims each october 21 and grab lunch at @entity226 , an idyllic spot by the water 's edge			2
for longer stays , there 's @entity232 on the other side of @entity234 ; it 's a hip boutique hotel with cool tunes , quirky art and an infinity pool			0
fish market , @entity50 @entity240 , one of @entity2 's best known chefs , described her country 's cuisine as " joyful , happy and hot -- just like @entity244			1
" her restaurant , at the @entity246 in @entity50 's financial district , serves traditional @entity244 recipes with a modern twist			1
but the best place to eat in @entity50 is still the fish market			1
there 's a good restaurant upstairs that draws the tourists , but far tastier , and infinitely more memorable , are the crowded stalls below for freshly caught ceviche scooped up with crackers , spicy aji chomdo sauce and stadium decibel reggaeton			0
@entity260 owned , operated and protected by the @entity261 , this archipelago of atolls off the northern coast of @entity2 , has a tropical island for every day of year , plus a few to spare ( 378 to be precise , 49 of which are inhabited )			2
the beaches are deserted enough to satisfy even the most extreme @entity269 fantasies			0
but the highlight is the @entity261 people themselves -- welcoming and proud of a culture that has changed little in centuries			0
be prepared to slow down , fast			0
