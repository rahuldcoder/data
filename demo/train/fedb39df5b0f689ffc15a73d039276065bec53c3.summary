when @entity2 's self - titled debut lp hit shelves on march 19 , 1962 , it did n't sound anything like the popular music of the time			1
it was the height of " the twist " dance craze , and 11 songs on the @entity11 chart had the word " twist " in the title , including " @entity12 " by @entity16 , " @entity17 " by @entity18 , " hey , @entity19 " by @entity20 , " " @entity21 " by the @entity22 and " @entity23 " by the @entity24			0
( a new @entity26 group called the @entity27 reached a new high of number 77 that week with their first single , " @entity29			0
' " ) to most of @entity31 , the @entity30 were the embodiment of folk music			0
the clean - cut , sweet - voiced @entity26 group hit number 25 that week with their cover of @entity38 's " @entity37 ? " @entity2 was also a fan of @entity38 's , but he sounded nothing like the @entity30			1
the 20 - year old singer - songwriter from @entity41 , @entity42 had been playing the coffee houses in @entity44 for a little over a year , mostly singing traditional folk songs in a nasal voice that was virtually impossible to imagine hearing on the radio			1
it was @entity50 record executive @entity49 who saw the huge potential in @entity2			1
the 51 - one year old , who famously discovered @entity53 and countless other jazz legends , became acquainted with @entity2 when he played harmonica at a recording session with folk singer @entity57			1
they met during a rehearsal in a @entity61 apartment			0
" we were all seated around a kitchen table , and @entity49 was seated next to @entity2 , " @entity57 recalled to @entity2 biographer @entity62 in his book " down the highway : the life of @entity2			1
" " @entity2 starts in on the harmonica and @entity49 turns and looks at him and could n't take his eyes off the great character			1
" his interest grew when he learned that @entity2 wrote his own songs			2
right around that time , @entity2 opened up for the @entity73 at @entity74 and earned a rave review in the @entity76 by pop writer @entity77			2
@entity49 did n't need any more convincing ; on october 25 , 1961 , he signed @entity2 to a five - year contract			1
a little more than a month later , they entered the studio together to record @entity2 's first album			1
they cut the whole thing in just six hours ( spread across two days ) for an estimated $ 402			0
" there was a violent , angry emotion running through me then , " @entity2 said			2
" i just played played guitar and harmonica and sang those songs , and that was it			0
mr. @entity49 asked me if i wanted to sing any of them over again and i said no. i ca n't see myself singing the same song twice in a row			2
" much like his live set at the time , the album consisted mainly of old folk songs , including " @entity98 " by @entity99 , " @entity100 " by @entity101 and " @entity102 ' to die " by @entity103			0
it was his rendition of " @entity105 " that caused him trouble in the tight - knit @entity61 folk music community			2
@entity108 -- one of @entity2 's earliest supporters and a huge presence in the @entity61 -- was famous for his arrangement of the traditional tune			1
" before going in the studio , he asked , ' @entity114 , mind if i record your version of " @entity118 ? ' " @entity119 recalled to @entity2 biographer @entity120			1
" i said , ' well , @entity122 , i 'm going into the studio soon and i 'd like to record it			2
' and later he asked me again and i told him i wanted to record it myself , and he said , ' oops , i already recorded it and i ca n't do anything about it because @entity50 wants it			1
' for a period of about two months we did n't speak to each other			0
he never apologizes , and i give him credit for it			0
" the album did contain two original songs : " @entity136 " and " @entity137			0
" the first song recounts @entity2 's earliest days in @entity44 when he " got a harmonica job , begun to play / @entity140 ' my lungs out for a dollar a day			1
" @entity2 claims he wrote " @entity137 , " a tribute to his musical hero @entity145 , just weeks after arriving in @entity44 , a trip partially inspired by the fact that @entity145 was living at @entity148 in @entity149 and @entity2 wanted to meet him			2
" ( ' @entity137 ' ) was written in @entity44 in the drugstore on @entity152 , " he said to sing out ! magazine in the summer of 1962			0
" it was one of them freezing days that i came back from @entity155 and @entity156 's in @entity157 , @entity149 ... @entity145 was there that day and it was a february sunday night ... and i just thought about @entity145 , i wondered about him , thought harder and wondered harder ... i wrote this song in five minutes ... it 's all i got to say			0
" the album failed to crack the billboard charts and sold about 5,000 copies that year			0
executives around @entity50 referred to @entity2 as " @entity165			1
" undeterred , @entity49 brought @entity2 back into the studio just one month after the album came out to begin work on his second lp			1
in the five months after the first album was recorded , @entity2 had turned his attention towards political causes			2
he recorded " the death of @entity178 " and " @entity179 " at the first session , and in july of 1962 , he returned to @entity174 with a new song called " @entity176			0
" it had been a part of his live show for months , and by the next summer , it would completely transform his life			0
