@entity0 -- phone records obtained by the government through a secret surveillance program disclosed last week helped to prevent " dozens " of terrorist acts , the director of the @entity3 told a @entity10 hearing on wednesday			1
army gen. @entity11 provided the most detailed account so far from a government official of the program in which the agency collects phone records that then can be accessed under federal court permission to investigate suspected terrorists			1
the scope of the secret program -- potentially involving phone records of every @entity23 -- set off a political firestorm when details emerged with publication of a leaked document			1
further leaks revealed other secret programs that collect computer activity and other information			2
critics on the right and left accused the government of going well beyond the intended reach of the @entity36 enacted after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity23			2
questioned by senators from both parties at a hearing on broader cybersecurity issues , @entity11 provided a spirited defense for the programs he described as critical to counter-terrorism efforts			1
" i think what we 're doing to protect @entity23 citizens here is the right thing , " he said			1
" our agency takes great pride in protecting this nation and our civil liberties and privacy , and doing it in partnership with this committee , with this @entity57 , and with the courts			0
" @entity11 added that he welcomed a public debate over protecting @entity23 while preserving civil liberties			1
" to date , we 've not been able to explain it because it 's classified , so that issue is something that we 're wrestling with , " he said			0
" ... this is n't something that 's just @entity3 or the administration doing that and so on			2
this is what ... our nation expects our government to do for us			0
so , we ought to have that debate			0
we ought to put it out there			0
" in the end , he said , some aspects of the giant surveillance apparatus created after 9/11 would have to remain classified			0
" and they should be , because if we tell the terrorists every way that we are going to track them , they will get through and @entity23 will die , " he said			2
@entity11 also rejected the claim that former @entity3 contractor @entity83 , who admitted leaking the top - secret documents on electronic surveillance programs and is now in hiding , could tap into any @entity23 's phone or e-mail			1
" i know of no way to do that , " he said , calling @entity83 's statement " false			0
" in an exchange with @entity94 sen. @entity93 of @entity95 , @entity11 said he believed the program under @entity97 of the @entity36 was " critical " in helping the intelligence community corroborate information on possible threats			2
" it is dozens of terrorist events that these have helped prevent , " @entity11 said of the section 215 program and another that collects information on foreign computer use			1
he would not discuss specific disrupted plots , saying they were classified , but he told @entity93 that the two programs together played a role in helping to stop a planned attack on the @entity113 subway system			0
information developed overseas was passed along to the @entity115 , which was able to identify suspect @entity116 in @entity117 and ultimately uncover a plot , he said			0
@entity116 pleaded guilty to terror - related charges in 2010			0
in response to questions from senators about why the section 215 program needed to collect billions of @entity23 phone records , @entity11 explained that the agency held the records for five years in the event that an investigation uncovered an overseas terrorist link to a specific area in the @entity23			1
with a database of phone records , the agency can go " back in time " to figure out the number and date that a suspect called , he said			1
" we wo n't search that unless we have some reasonable , articulable suspicion about a terrorist - related organization , " @entity11 said			0
once permission is granted , " we can now look and say , ' who was this guy talking to in the @entity23 and why ? ' " opinion : why @entity3 spying scares the world " the system just gives us back who he was talking to , " @entity11 explained			1
" but if you did n't collect it , how do you know who he was talking to ? " obtaining further information , such as the content of the call , would require a court order , he said			0
@entity156 sen. @entity155 of @entity157 pressed @entity11 on the issue , asking if the search could span " the breadth of telephone records			1
" " the @entity23 public is fearful that in this massive amount of data you get that there 's the ability of the federal government to synthesize that data and learn something more than maybe what was ever contemplated by the @entity36 , " @entity155 said			2
@entity3 hacks @entity171 , leaker claims @entity11 will return to the panel on thursday to give a classified briefing on the programs in order to provide more information , and he pledged to work with the committee to come up with more detailed explanations for the @entity23 public			1
he explained his caution on wednesday by saying revelations such as the classified documents about the secret programs were harmful to national security efforts			0
" i would rather take a public beating and people think i am hiding something than to jeopardize the security of this country , " @entity11 said			0
