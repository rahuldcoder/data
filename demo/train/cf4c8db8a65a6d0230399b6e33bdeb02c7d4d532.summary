@entity1 , @entity2 @entity2 crews pulled out more bodies following last year 's crash of an @entity8 jet , raising the total to 100 so far , authorities said sunday			1
of the 100 bodies recovered , 72 have been identified , police said			1
efforts are underway to identify the remaining victims			2
@entity14 plunged into the sea on december 28 as it flew from the @entity2 city of @entity17 toward @entity18			1
it had 162 people on board			2
divers resumed their attempt to lift up the fuselage of the @entity25 jet on sunday after earlier attempts failed			1
before the plane crashed , the co-pilot was flying the jet as the more experienced pilot monitored the flight			1
things may have gone wrong in a span of three minutes and 20 seconds , triggering a stall warning that sounded until it crashed into the @entity35 , according to @entity2 's transportation officials			1
though it 's common for the co-pilot to be in control of the aircraft , significant questions remain			2
why did the plane start a sudden , steep ascent ? was bad weather a factor ? the plane was in good condition and the entire crew was certified , said @entity49 , the chief investigator for the transportation committee			0
the flight took off and cruised at 32,000 feet amid stormy weather			0
the pilot then asked the control tower whether the plane could ascend to 38,000 feet , according to the committee			0
the plane was veering left and wobbling , said @entity58 , a senior pilot and investigator with the committee			0
it then ascended from its cruising altitude to 37,400 feet in about 30 seconds in a steep ascent , the chief investigator said			0
commercial planes are not designed to ascend so quickly , and may have been climbing at a rate twice as fast as it should , analysts said			0
officials have said that the aircraft climbed rapidly before it tumbled into the water			1
investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash , but officials said they would not release it just yet			1
it 's unclear whether or when the initial report will be released			0
while that report presents facts , officials indicated there is n't enough verification yet			2
