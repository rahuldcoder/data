upon the flight 's return " the flight was met by law enforcement including @entity13 agents and three individuals were removed from the plane to include a grandmother , mother and child , " @entity13 spokesman @entity29 confirmed , via email			1
" the mother was taken into custody on suspicion of committing an international parental kidnapping and the child was reunited with the father			1
the grandmother was not detained			2
" the criminal complaint charges that @entity36 , also known as @entity37 , unlawfully attempted " to remove a child from the @entity39 with intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of parental rights			2
" after separating and starting divorce proceedings in 2013 , @entity37 and @entity44 were awarded joint custody of their 4 - year - old son , who was born in @entity49 and is a dual @entity39 - @entity49 citizen , the complaint stated			1
the 2014 custody agreement does n't allow either party to travel outside of the @entity39 without " express written and notarized consent of the other party , provided in advance of the trip , " according to the complaint			0

the @entity39 and more than 70 other countries have signed the convention , but it only applies if both countries involved are signatories			0
" that leaves many countries where there is no partner " for the @entity39 to negotiate with , said heads			0
" it can be a real challenge at times for parents			0
" @entity49 is not a signatory to the convention , which heads said could have made it harder for the father in the @entity2 case to get his child back			2
