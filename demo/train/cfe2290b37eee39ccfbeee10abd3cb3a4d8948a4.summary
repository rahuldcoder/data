@entity0 -- while 39 @entity5 @entity4 voted with @entity6 on a proposed fix to canceled insurance policies under @entity9 on friday , sources on both sides said more would have defected without president @entity11 's mea culpa over the mess			1
as it is , the vote is an embarrassment for the president , but it could have been worse			2
another 18 defectors could have given @entity6 a veto - proof majority and ammunition to really pressure the @entity4 - controlled @entity19 to take up the measure			2
but senior @entity4 aides said that might have been possible before thursday			0
that 's when @entity11 took action on his own , met with reporters to talk about it , and dispatched his chief of staff , @entity26 , to @entity27 to meet with @entity4 lawmakers			1
one senior @entity4 @entity5 aide described the mood of the caucus between wednesday and thursday as " night and day			1
" other aides echoed that sentiment			0
in addition to announcing his plan to try to repair the damage done under @entity9 , the president 's q&a was as much about trying to provide political cover for @entity4 in tough reelection bids next year			1
some have been targeted by the @entity6 's campaign machine			0
almost all of the @entity4 defectors fall into that category			0
freshman @entity4 rep. @entity46 of @entity47 tried to play down his vote as a rebuke of the president			2
" for me personally , it was an issue of giving some people some time to transition to do things in an orderly way			0
there 's clearly some issues that we 'd like to fix and make better , " he said			0
rep. @entity58 , another @entity59 who faces a tough campaign next year in @entity61 , also rejected the notion that a vote for the @entity6 bill would help undermine the entire @entity9 law			1
" i think any fix that we can make , particularly when a problem arises , is good for the people back home			0
and look , the truth of the matter is : i 'm accountable to the people who sent me here , " @entity58 said			0
" i respect our leadership on both sides of the aisle , but the leadership did n't elect me ; my constituents did			0
and i 'm going to make sure i listen to them , and do what i can to support them when they have problems and concerns , and that 's what i 'm doing in this case , " he added			0
rep. @entity88 of @entity89 told @entity1 on thursday he was undecided on how he would vote but ultimately decided to vote against the @entity6 plan after he was briefed on the president 's fix			2
" the @entity94 bill did nothing to address the situation in which some individuals have had their coverage canceled by their insurance provider , " @entity88 said			1
" we can not allow @entity100 to be subjected to capricious cancellations , lifetime limits on their coverage , no coverage or unaffordable coverage because of pre-existing conditions and higher premiums based on gender for the same basic coverage			2
" the legislation proposed by rep. @entity94 would extend for a year those policies that were set to be canceled , and would allow anyone to purchase them			1
they are for the most part cheaper but they do n't meet coverage demands spelled out under the @entity9			1
the fix : @entity11 tries to dig out of his big @entity9 hole @entity11 after the president 's news conference on thursday during which he said he " fumbled " the @entity9 's launch , he immediately resumed his public relations tour touting the measure -- his signature domestic policy achievement			1
" we 're not going to gut the law			0
we 're going to fix what needs to be fixed , " @entity11 said in @entity128			1
after fix , @entity11 vows not to ' gut ' health care reform friday , he was back at the @entity5 working to keep his promise to address its shortcomings as the @entity6 - led @entity5 took its own action to reverse the insurance policy cancellations			1
@entity11 met with insurance company @entity137 whose help he needs to carry out freshly announced rules that would allow those receiving health policy cancellations due to @entity9 to keep their plans for another year			1
the discussion with the @entity137 , who represented the country 's major insurance carriers , revolved around the best paths for consumers to enroll in coverage			2
" the discussion was productive -- the insurance ceos and administration officials discussed the next steps in working with states and state insurance commissioners to use the new flexibility the administration announced to address cancellation notices going to consumers , " the @entity5 said in a statement			1
everyone attending the meeting " stressed the importance of working together to minimize disruption for consumers as well as the need to continue to reach consumers with clear information about their options and choices			0
" the @entity5 did not detail the meeting nor did it disclose what , if any , potential solutions were offered			1
@entity173 : for @entity11 , a bad turn or a tipping point ? @entity19 @entity59 alternative parked -- for the time being despite @entity11 's apology and efforts to make amends for saying previously that @entity100 would n't lose coverage under the law he championed , a couple of moderate @entity4 in the @entity19 said they would still push for a legislative fix that goes a little further than the administrative steps outlined by the president on thursday			1
" i feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them , " @entity11 said on thursday about @entity4 who supported his bill and now face tougher reelection bids because of the law 's difficult beginning			1
vice president @entity195 joined one of those @entity197 , @entity196 of @entity198 , at a campaign event on friday			1
but @entity4 who lead the @entity19 have indicated , however , that they will not bring up new @entity9 legislation for a vote for the moment , wanting to first see how the president 's approach works			1
republicans : we told you so @entity6 have spent much of the past three years attempting to defund and dismantle @entity9 as unworkable and an illegitimate law since it was rammed through by a @entity210 without their backing and then signed by a @entity4 president			2
they have held hearings and investigations and the @entity5 has had dozens of votes to weaken or repeal it			1
now , @entity6 lawmakers are seizing the moment with the law under fire to effectively say " we told you so			0
" house speaker @entity221 recently called @entity9 " a failure " and @entity4 risk supporting it further at their political peril			2
insurance companies the @entity5 did not mandate the changes on policy cancellations but asked insurance companies to take the lead and offer extensions			1
health insurers , as represented by the @entity231 trade group , warned that last - minute changes in the law could " destabilize the market and result in higher premiums			2
" the individual policy contracts that are most affected comprise about 5 % of the overall insurance market			2
@entity5 , insurers locked in unhappy marriage at least one major insurer , @entity241 , said it would allow for extensions , but put the burden on state insurance commissioners to approve the changes			1
these entities regulate industry and usually look out for consumer interests			0
they determine coverage standards and benefits			0
insurers met with @entity11 at the @entity5 on friday where he said they would " brainstorm " on the best approach for carrying out his rule changes			1
state insurance commissions although they are ultimately responsible for allowing the extensions , an insurance commission source said state commissioners were " not consulted " prior to the president 's announced administrative fix			0
3 hurdles @entity9 must overcome the reason for many cancellations was that affected plans did n't meet new federal standards for minimum coverage requirements under @entity9			1
this includes preventative care , maternity care and mental health care			0
@entity272 indicated that it would not allow a year extension , saying that it is too complicated and disruptive at this late date			0
more than canceled insurance plans canceled policies is not the only headache for @entity11			1
the federally run website where consumers can purchase insurance , @entity282 , barely functioned on its launch october 1			0
while improvements have been made , problems continue , making it difficult for people to enroll and browse plans offered by private companies			0
including similar online exchanges offered through 36 states , overall @entity9 enrollment numbers for the first month underperformed with only 106,000 signing up for coverage			2
that 's far from the seven million over time that experts anticipate will be needed to ensure that @entity9 works economically			2
it relies heavily on younger , healthier participants to help cover the cost of insuring older people who need more health care services			0
a bright spot , however , is the enrollment of @entity303 , which has been expanded in 25 states under the new law			0
nearly half a million people have signed up for benefits under the federal health insurance program for the poor			0
@entity1 's @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this story			0
