the head of the @entity41 , @entity40 , defended its performance			1
" we will not compromise border security but we always aim to keep disruption to a minimum by using our staff flexibly to meet demand , " he said in a statement			1
" the vast majority of passengers pass through immigration control quickly			0
queues are caused by a number of factors , including incorrect flight manifests or early or late planes which result in bunching			2

" @entity40 said the agency was working with @entity15 to monitor flight arrivals and passenger movements for the rest of the weekend			2

" passenger @entity108 also experienced long delays thursday when he arrived back at @entity6 's @entity79 from a business trip to @entity111			1
he told @entity1 was yelled at by @entity6 security staff to " get to the end the queue " and when he questioned what was going on was told " we do n't know			1
" when he made it to the passport control for the @entity11 , he found many of the desks unmanned , he said			0
there was " no explanation , no apology			0
i felt i was treated like commodity , not a valued customer of the airport			0
" his experience at @entity6 compared very badly to the efficiency he saw at @entity111 , @entity129 said , and " will kill business for @entity3 unless it is fixed			1
" @entity131 , the former @entity132 communications chief under @entity134 prime minister @entity133 , tweeted thursday : " if this is what @entity137 border queue is like on an average thursday @entity74 athletes should think about coming soon			1

only three or four staff were on duty to process @entity11 arrivals and three for @entity144 arrivals , he said			0
