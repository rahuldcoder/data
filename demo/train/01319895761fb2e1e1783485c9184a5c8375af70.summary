most of us can clearly recall where we were on december 26 , 2004 , when a massive earthquake off the northern coast of @entity6 , @entity3 triggered a deadly tsunami that swept across the @entity8 , killing more than 226,000 people and causing massive destruction along coastal areas of 14 countries			2
the tsunami caused one of the worst natural disasters in recent memory , as its full horror unfolded on tv screens around the world			2
ten years on , it is important to reflect on what the tsunami has taught us and whether these communities are any safer from such disasters			1
one clear lesson reinforced by the tsunami has been the importance of investing in disaster risk reduction ( @entity27 ) at both global and local levels			1
in january 2005 , @entity29 ( @entity30 ) -- a global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts with a ten - year plan -- was adopted by 168 governments			1
its goal was to substantially reduce disaster losses by 2015 by building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters			2
in june 2006 , the @entity41 became active , consisting of 25 seismographic stations -- used to detect earthquakes early -- relaying information to 26 national tsunami information centers			2
this has resulted in timely evacuations of mass populations when alerts are sounded			0
removing red tape the tsunami also highlighted how weak legislation led to blockages and major coordination challenges in the delivery of international assistance			1
the @entity29 calls for improved legislation to facilitate international disaster response , an area where the @entity60 and @entity60 ( @entity60 ) has been working closely with governments through its disaster laws program			1
twelve countries in @entity64 have made , or are progressing towards , legislative or regulatory changes			0
these include @entity3 , where the @entity67 has revised its regulations relating to the participation of the international community in national emergencies			2
another example is the @entity73 , where , following @entity76 in 2013 , the government relaxed immigration requirements and established one - stop - shops to streamline the clearance process for incoming goods and equipment			0
but global and national initiatives need to go hand - in - hand with investment in locally driven approaches towards reducing risk			2
working with communities to help them be better prepared to face future disasters was the thread that ran through the @entity60 's recovery efforts after the tsunami			0
supporting the rebuilding of physical infrastructure , including 57,000 new homes , was one step , but establishing community based disaster risk management programs was equally important			1
@entity100 teams were set up in @entity101 , training was given to thousands of first - responders in @entity103 , and early warning systems -- using @entity105 -- were established across @entity3 alongside mangrove planting projects to reduce the impact of coastal flooding			1
the legacy of those initiatives lives on today			0
improving communication community participation and engagement in risk reduction is vital and the tsunami cast a spotlight on the need to improve accountability and two - way communication with crisis affected communities			1
in @entity123 , @entity3 , traditional and hi - tech approaches were used to enable people to raise questions or air concerns about the aid effort via community meetings , live radio and @entity130			0
such approaches have since become integral aspects of major operations and have proved essential in health promotion and social mobilization campaigns			0
next year , the @entity136 on @entity137 takes place in @entity139 where @entity30 will take shape			0
this represents a unique opportunity to re-focus attention on the need for greater investment in community level disaster risk reduction			1
this means recognizing that local people and organizations are first responders in emergencies ; understanding that they must be the drivers of change in their communities as they have the best understanding of the risks they face			0
it also means investing in strengthening the risk reduction capacities of local , city and regional authorities			1
while we ca n't prevent another tsunami , we do know that many people in harms way today are now more aware and better prepared to face future disasters			0
the challenge ahead remains how we align global and local action to safeguard future generations .			0

lesson reinforced by tsunami is importance of investing in disaster risk reduction
@entity174 highlighted how weak laws led to blockages and challenges in delivering assistance
establishing community based disaster risk management programs like *search* teams in @entity101 , training in @entity103 also important
