-- " sitting in class , second grade , teachers would put me outside the hallway because i had been ticking so loud i was a ' distraction , ' " recalled 25 - year - old @entity0			1
" teachers would walk by me back and forth and say ' you 'd better stop that before you get into my class next year			2
' things that were just completely obscene , that you would never expect the world to be , and i had to deal with on a daily basis			0
" from the age of five , @entity14 has suffered from @entity17 's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes her to make involuntary movements and loud noises , known as tics			1
for almost 20 years , the condition has shaped every moment of her life			0
" i do n't remember any parts of ever being tic free , " she said			0
" there 's not a day that 's gone by that i do n't remember moving or making noise when i could n't help it			2
" but she has not let @entity17 's dictate how she lives			1
@entity0 graduated from high school with honors and was even accepted to college on full scholarship			1
but her uncontrollable outbursts have made it hard to continue her education or even hold down a steady job			0
there is one thing that comes easy though			0
she loves to sing , and when she does , her tics are curiously absent			0
" singing is what gets me through a lot of hard days			0
when i 'm on the computer , when i 'm driving , when i write poetry , basically anything with a sense of focus , " @entity0 explained			1
" when i have to worry about my tics i do just that -- i worry about my tics			0
" deep brain stimulation there is no cure for @entity17 's syndrome			1
but after years of suffering and unsuccessful therapies , @entity14 was selected for experimental surgery by specialists from the @entity63 's @entity62			1
the procedure is called deep brain stimulation ( @entity66 ) , where small electrodes are implanted into the brain to stimulate affected regions in patients with movement disorders such as parkinson 's disease or tremors			1
the delivery of electricity is at the root of what makes @entity66 work			0
the electrodes are attached to an impulse generator , or pacemaker , implanted under the patient 's skin , which provides electrical impulses to the affected region of the brain			1
by providing impulses to circuits in the brain associated with a specific motor skill , it 's possible to change the connections between neurons and stop the abnormal activity that causes the symptoms			1
@entity66 was first approved for tremors in 1997 and since then more than 100,000 patients have had the procedure			0
but @entity14 's surgery would be the first time the technique had been used for @entity17 's			1
@entity17 's syndrome is characterized by an impulsivity that combines both emotion and motor activity and makes the underlying neurology differ from that of @entity107 's and other conditions previously treated with @entity66			1
" the difference in @entity17 is the movement is n't there all the time , " explained neurologist dr. @entity109 , co-director of the @entity62 and author of " @entity111 : 10 secrets to a happier life with @entity107			1
" " the patients that have a tic , they get this build up ; they call it a premonitory urge			0
they feel like they need to move and until they move , they do n't feel better			0
" this urge to tic is a daily woe for people like @entity14			0
" it 's like having 15 mosquito bites that you ca n't itch , " she said			2
" there 's no way to ever tell they are coming			2
" until now , treatments available for @entity17 's have been behavioral therapy and drug medications			1
these treatments , however , only manage the severity of tics to make them less disruptive and do not prevent them			2
" without my medications , i am one of the worst cases the doctors have ever seen in the @entity144 , " said @entity0			2
experimental surgery in september 2014 , @entity14 had the @entity66 electrodes implanted in her brain -- a 12 - hour process that involved six operations			1
in addition to the standard electrode leads , she had a new grid - like device implanted on top of her brain -- an experimental procedure intended to gather information from her brain that could not only lessen her tics , but maybe someday stop them			2
not only did @entity14 have four holes drilled into her skull , but she was awake throughout the process			0
" the way sedatives work is by suppressing brain activity , so we get better recordings if we do n't use any sedatives , " explained dr. @entity164 , also co-director of the @entity62 , who performed the surgery			2
the team uses music to help relax the patient while the painless , but stressful , procedure is carried out			0
" we let them pick the music to take the focus off the fact that i am drilling a hole in their head , and cutting their scalp and that sort of thing , " said @entity164			0
@entity14 's surgery was a success , but implanting the stimulation and recording devices is just the start of the @entity66 process			1
@entity109 and @entity194 will now monitor @entity14 's brain activity over the next six to 12 months			2
the grid will provide insight into the underlying cause of her @entity17 's syndrome and allow the doctors to regulate the electrical impulses so that they can begin to manage and maybe someday , eliminate her tics			1
for @entity14 , this is her chance to finally live a normal life			0
" if it 's a chance to change my life for the better and to make sure i do n't have to deal with this anymore , i 'm up for it , " said @entity0			1
" i have had this 20 years , and i think i 've done my time			0
