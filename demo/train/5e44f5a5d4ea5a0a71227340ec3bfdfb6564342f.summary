-- the larger - than - life story of baseball great @entity3 will open on the big screen this month along with the beginning of the new baseball season			1
" 42 " is slated to open on april 12 , just three days before the 66th anniversary of @entity3 's debut game that broke baseball 's color barrier			1
the film follows @entity3 , the first @entity13 to play @entity14 , as he plays for the @entity15 , and highlights the bond that formed between @entity3 and @entity15 general manager and president , @entity19			1
@entity19 is played by @entity20 , who was not originally on the shortlist for the part			1
" the filmmakers did n't send ( the script ) to me , i just happened upon it , " @entity20 recently told @entity0			2
" i came through backdoor channels and i read it and i thought this is a great opportunity to play this character if anybody 's interested in seeing me about it			1
" except no one was			0
" they would not have known about my ambition to play this kind of character in a faithful way ... to approach it as a character actor and be willing and ready to let loose of my former career as a leading man			2
" after some persuasion , @entity40 landed the role of @entity19 -- although , true to his intent to get lost in the character , you might not even recognize him in the part			2
when it came to casting @entity3 , writer / director @entity47 , who has previously written screenplays for " @entity49 " and " a @entity50 , " knew upon meeting @entity52 that he wanted him to fill the uniform			1
the actor , who 's previously appeared on tv in shows like " @entity57 " and " @entity58 , " was directing an @entity59 play at the time of his audition , but just so happened to be in @entity62 when his agent called about " 42			1
" but though @entity47 knew right away , " i definitely did n't know right away , " @entity52 told @entity0			2
after reading for @entity47 the first time , " i came in the next week and read for him again , and realized that he already made his decision and he was trying to prove it to somebody else			0
i did a baseball tryout , and the rest is history			0
" @entity47 " said i was the person who showed the most courage , and that 's why i got it , " @entity52 said			1
@entity52 played some @entity77 as a kid and describes himself as an athlete			0
" so it was n't like i could n't walk and chew gum at the same time , " he joked			0
but he obviously needed practice in order to emulate one of the best in the history of baseball			0
" we did spring training from the middle of january to may , " he said			0
" we prepared as if we were going to play a game			0
" in order to see how he was shaping up in his attempt to accurately bring @entity3 's skills to life , @entity52 would watch a split - screen of his own practices next to some of @entity3 's @entity100 footage -- so he could see " how bad i was " compared to @entity3			1
like @entity52 , @entity40 logged hours extensively researching his character , working to understand the ins and outs of the sport , though he 's not a huge sports fan generally			2
" i researched the character and the history , and i know the history			0
i know the circumstances that took place and the character of our nation at the time , but i did n't know much about the man : @entity19 , " @entity20 said			1
" there was a lot of research material and i took advantage of all of it , and studied it			0
" as for the reason we have n't seen more @entity3 biopics flood cineplexes , @entity40 muses that it might be because @entity3 's wife , @entity125 , has been careful with her husband 's legacy			1
" until @entity47 produced the script , i do n't think she 'd been satisfied with the telling of the story , " @entity20 said			0
" and not so much because it glorifies her husband , but because it embraces the fulsome understanding of the circumstances , and so she 's responsible for allowing us to tell the story			0
