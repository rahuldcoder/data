-- the dirty and tattered piece of paper , with remnants of thick black industrial - strength tape still stuck to its edges , would not necessarily seem to be a harbinger of summer			1
but those capitalized words running down the page ... catch			2
get around ... i pulled the piece of paper from the surface of the stage right after the show had ended			2
there was a copy of it next to the base of each microphone stand , so the musicians could look down to see what they were supposed to play and sing next			2
the capitalized words were shorthand for each song : " catch a wave			2
" " i get around			2
" @entity32 's coming , all right			1
i had caught up with the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , on a friday night this spring			1
they were scheduled to play at the @entity38			2
it will soon be half a century that they have been singing and touring			1
fifty years since they really were little more than boys , writing and singing the songs of summer for the first time			1
too much has happened to them since they first took to the stage wearing those identical striped shirts , nervous young men careful to bow to the audience after each song			2
@entity53 and @entity54 are dead ; the much - publicized acrimony in the band has meant that @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 almost never share the same stage anymore			2
not that anyone asked for my opinion , but here it is anyway : we all are given a finite number of heartbeats in this life			0
if i were those three guys , i 'd find some way to put the old anger aside and play that wonderful music together again			0
before it 's too late			1
but this column is n't about the singers			0
it 's about the songs they gave to the world			1
the songs have brought so much happiness to so many generations , for all these years			1
" @entity93 " and " @entity94 " and " @entity95 " and " @entity96 " -- they are @entity99 's enduring soundtrack of summer , they somehow never grow old , and there is a chance that , because of those songs , the @entity34 may one day enter @entity88 territory in the national memory , becoming a sustaining part of @entity92 history			1
it 's too soon for that , though ; for now , there 's a new summer of one - nighters stretching out ahead			1
backstage in @entity35 we ate a cafeteria - style dinner ; i sat with @entity109 , a @entity34 guitarist with whom i spent 15 summers on the road while he and i were touring with @entity112			1
he told me that at a television studio in @entity114 recently he had shared a similar commissary meal with astronaut @entity116			0
" we talked about the moon , spirituality and surf music , " @entity109 said			0
that is one of the many unlikely places that singing the songs of summer can take a person : to the side of a man who walked upon the surface of the moon			1
@entity128 , the actor , has gone on the road to sing with the @entity34 whenever he can for the last 25 years ; he was in @entity35 on this night , and as we talked , @entity58 , the band 's lead singer , came over with his own plate of food			1
i asked him if he thought there might be a band called the @entity34 on the road even after all the original @entity34 are gone			1
" i do n't see why not , " he said			0
" the music 's not going to die , is it ? " that 's the secret			1
there is something about those songs that transcends nostalgia , that parts the clouds , that brings smiles of contentment year after year , town after town			1
no matter how cruddy the day may have been , no matter what worries may be gnawing at you			0
... well , as the song advises : " @entity151			0
" everything will turn out all right			0
the show started , the guitars sounded , the audience rose to cheer			1
the gloriously predictable set -- " @entity157 , " " @entity158 , " " @entity159 , " " @entity160 " -- unfurled			0
for 105 minutes , the world seemed peaceful			0
as " @entity162 " was ending , @entity128 looked to where i was standing in the wings and motioned with his head for me to join him			0
he handed me his candy - apple - red @entity167 , and we shared a microphone on " @entity171 , " and i wish you who are reading these words could look out into a @entity34 audience and see the upturned faces on the cusp of another summer , the people joyfully singing along with songs whose lyrics they know as well as they know the @entity180 or the names of the presidents			1
unhappiness , it seems , can against all odds be kept at bay			0
one - hundred - five minutes at a time			0
it was after the encore , after the audience had filed out , that i returned to the stage and tore that set list from the floor			0
i glanced at it : catch			0
... i stuck it into my pocket			0
a souvenir in advance of warm months that will soon be arriving			0
however many of those heartbeats we each are given , they seem to swell more gratefully when summer is on its way			2
catch a wave and you 're @entity205 .			0

@entity208 says it 's been nearly 50 years since @entity34 started singing and touring
he says their songs are @entity92 *classics* and still have *resonance*
