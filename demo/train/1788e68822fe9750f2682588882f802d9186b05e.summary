-- megaupload , the file - sharing website shut down thursday by the @entity3 federal government , is a web hosting tool that now finds itself accused of being an online haven for digital pirates			1
many people probably never have heard of the site			0
but to millions , the 6 - year - old site , based in @entity11 , was a fast , easy way to store massive files in a " locker " online and then share them with friends or colleagues			1
at various points in its history , @entity17 has been among the most popular websites in the world			2
and it once had the support of some celebrities			0
a ( really bizarre ) @entity25 video shows @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and several other celebrities vouching for the site in an apparent music video - style advertisement			2
but the site has long suffered accusations of allowing less - than - legal files to pass through its computer servers			2
" @entity17 was always going to get taken down -- far too flagrant publication of copyrighted material , " @entity39 , a website editor living in @entity40 , @entity41 , wrote on @entity42 , a blog devoted to file - sharing issues			1
" i think sharing on the @entity46 is great , and i do n't care if it 's copyrighted material -- but @entity17 and some similar sites are making loads of money out of making it possible for people to view pirated stuff			1
of course they will be targeted as they are blatantly breaking laws			0
" the @entity3 attorney for @entity17 denies the government 's allegations			1
' we believe that the allegations are without merit and @entity17 is going to vigorously defend against the case , " attorney @entity61 said			2
created in 2005 , @entity17 was the 72nd - most - visited site on the web during the past three months and has peaked as high as no. 13 , according to @entity70 traffic analytics firm @entity68			1
the site offered what 's called " one - click hosting , " letting users upload anything on their hard drive or in cloud storage to the @entity46			1
the service gives users a url that can then be shared with others -- often on discreet online message boards or social networks -- letting them access the file as well			2
@entity17 was the site 's video service , letting even nonmembers view more than an hour of video at a time on the site , and @entity17 was a photo storage and sharing site in the mold of @entity93 or @entity94			1
people who paid for a premium account on the site were able to upload and download larger files			2
it was , by all accounts , a successful business model			0
the @entity3 government said that it seized $ 50 million in assets and that much of the $ 175 million the site has earned since 2005 was due to copyright infringement			1
as @entity107 notes , even the site 's graphic designer reportedly earned $ 1 million last year , and between them , the seven indicted people ( including the creatively named @entity109 ) owned 15 @entity111 , a @entity112 , a @entity113 and a @entity114			1
the blog @entity115 has posted photos of seized assets , including the cars and a large house in @entity121 , in case you 're interested			0
publicly , at least , the site frowned on illegal uploads			0
it featured a tool to report " abuse , " gave copyright holders the ability to hunt for illegal content and registered with the @entity3 government under the @entity133 , a law aimed at fighting piracy			1
the site 's owners have denied any wrongdoing in regard to copyright violation , and their attorney has said the site was wrongly shut down before its owners were allowed to address the charges against them			1
but the @entity145 says the anti-theft efforts were a facade -- that @entity17 's employees knew they were enabling piracy and made the site difficult for outsiders to search for illegal material			1
in an unofficial sampling of @entity155 readers on @entity156 , many quickly acknowledged using the site to watch tv shows or movies			0
but others cited more legitimate uses , with some saying they 've lost legitimate content , not to mention money , after the government crackdown			0
@entity166 of @entity167 said he recently paid roughly $ 260 for a lifetime membership so he could store old files from childhood and college			0
he did n't lose them , but now he 's gotten nothing in return for his payment , he said			0
developers of open - source @entity177 and @entity180 software said they used it to upload projects they were working on together			0
musicians , as well , said they stored songs for collaborative projects there			0
one user said she used it for sharing large zip files of photographs that were too unwieldy to send via e-mail			0
" @entity17 was closed by the @entity192 ... was i the only ones who had it for work files ? " @entity156 user @entity196 wrote			2
" just get me my files back ! ! ! " the charges come at a time when online piracy is a hot topic			0
new legislation before the @entity203 -- which would have cracked down on piracy but , according to critics , would also have endangered free speech online -- has stalled at least temporarily after a massive online protest this week			0
( full disclosure : @entity0 's parent company , @entity207 , supports that anti-piracy legislation			0
) some people online say the @entity17 takedown , which came a day after @entity212 and other sites went black in protest of the pending legislation , was largely symbolic -- singling out one site while bigger ones still thrive			1
with a couple of quick clicks on a pair of well - known file - sharing sites on friday , @entity0 was able to see that @entity223 's entire discography , every " @entity230 " episode for the past six seasons and @entity227 's epic " @entity228 , " which is currently playing in theaters , were offered up for download by anyone seeking out those files .			1

the @entity3 government shut down file - sharing site @entity17 on thursday
megaupload let users upload files with a single click
the government says the site 's owners knowingly allowed copyright infringement
on friday , pirated material was still easy to find on other sites
