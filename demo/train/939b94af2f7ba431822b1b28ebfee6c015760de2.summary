@entity0 -- in an extended shutdown , most of the federal workforce would go without pay , but the checks will keep coming to the 533 current members of @entity8			1
who gets paid in a shutdown and who does n't ? " that is disgraceful in my view , " said freshman rep. @entity12 , @entity13 , told @entity1			1
" basically the only people who get paid in a shutdown are members of @entity8 , and that is irresponsible			1
" @entity12 plans to send any pay she receives during a shutdown back to the @entity21			1
the combat veteran said she was shocked to find out recently that members ' pay is protected			1
it is -- by the @entity26			0
opinion : taxpayers , you deserve your money back the 27th amendment to the @entity26 restricts any @entity8 from changing its own pay			1
the measure was proposed in the first days of the @entity34 but was not ratified until 1992 , after a grass - roots movement promoted the idea and the necessary number of state legislatures approved it			0
while many may have wanted to restrain @entity8 from increasing its pay , the amendment also blocks @entity8 from freezing or cutting its compensation			1
the result ? @entity8 gets paid no matter what			1
@entity12 is not the only member surprised			0
the list : what 's open , what 's closed " i do n't even know whether it stops or not , " rep. @entity49 , @entity50 , said when asked about his pay during a shutdown			2
when told that the @entity26 mandates congressional paychecks stay as - is , @entity49 responded that he had n't thought through what he would do yet but would likely donate his pay during a shutdown to charity			1
" obviously we need to share the pain of the @entity61 people , " he concluded			0
the offices for the top two members of @entity8 -- house speaker @entity64 and @entity66 majority leader @entity65 -- would n't respond to specifics about their pay			1
according to a report by the @entity73 newspaper , senate minority leader @entity69 , @entity70 , plans to donate his salary to charity during the shutdown			2
rep. @entity77 , @entity78 , told @entity1 he is urging his fellow members of @entity8 to donate their pay to charitable causes			1
" i do n't think we should get paid until ( the shutdown ) is resolved , " rep. @entity81 , @entity82 , told @entity1 's @entity83 on tuesday			2
" i 've asked the clerk to withhold any pay for me until we get this up and running			2
i just think that that 's fair for the folks involved who 've been negatively affected by this			0
" @entity93 minority whip @entity92 , d - @entity94 , disagreed with @entity81			0
" i think that 's another game ( @entity96 ) want to play , appealing to a demagogic approach to this , " @entity92 told @entity83 on tuesday			0
shutdown ' extremely damaging ' to @entity61 intelligence operations " members of @entity8 ought to be on the job working hard , " @entity92 added , " getting this job done to the @entity61 people , getting their government opened , getting federal employees back to work and serving the public , serving the growth of our economy , serving our national security ends			1
" while members will get paid , they must decide which of their own office staff have to go home			2
members of @entity8 run their own office payroll and will decide who is essential and non essential			1
but even congressional staff members who work during a shutdown would not get paid until later -- only their bosses will get paid on time			1
" my staffers are working with pay			2
right now , " sen. @entity125 , @entity126 , said tuesday on " @entity127			0
" " they 're doing oversight on the federal government			2
... they 're continuing to work on the waste			2
" @entity125 also said he 's keeping his salary earned during the shutdown			0
" i 'm going to keep my salary and going to make sure i spend it and tithe it and give to it charities and do the thing that i 've always done			0
... i 'm not going to stop working			0
" but @entity142 sen. @entity141 of @entity143 , who appeared alongside @entity125 on " crossfire " on tuesday , is taking a different approach			0
" eighty percent of my staff , unfortunately , is on furlough , " she said , " i 'm going to be contributing [ my salary ] on a daily basis			0
for every day we are not seeing an open -- a government that 's open , i 'm contributing			0
" @entity61 hurt as @entity0 ' squabbles like kids ' @entity1 's @entity155 , @entity156 , and @entity157 contributed to this report .			0
