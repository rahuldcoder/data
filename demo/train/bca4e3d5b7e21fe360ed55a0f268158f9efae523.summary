@entity0 , @entity1 -- the federal agency responsible for overseeing the oil industry has been renamed amid a massive reform effort following the @entity8 oil disaster in the @entity9 , the @entity3 announced monday			1
the @entity10 will be called the @entity10 , according to an order signed by interior secretary @entity12 requesting the name change			1
the announcement coincided with the swearing - in of the bureau 's new head , former justice department inspector - general @entity18 , who is tasked with overhauling the troubled government agency			1
critics , including president @entity22 , have said the @entity10 has too often catered to the interests of the industry it is responsible for policing			1
a 2008 report from the @entity3 's inspector - general found @entity10 employees received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them			1
the agency has been thrust into the spotlight since the april 20 explosion of the drill rig @entity39 that triggered the worst oil spill in @entity42 history			0
as much as 60,000 barrels ( 2.5 million gallons ) of oil may be gushing into the @entity9 every day , government estimates found last week			0
approximately 23,290 barrels of oil -- slightly more than 978,000 gallons -- were collected from the ruptured well in the 24 - hour period ending at midnight sunday , @entity48 adm. @entity47 said monday			1
" the @entity8 oil spill has underscored the need for stronger oversight of offshore oil and gas operations , more tools and resources for aggressive enforcement , and a more effective structure for the agency that holds companies accountable , " @entity18 said in a statement monday			1
" we will move quickly and responsibly on our reforms			0
" also monday , a federal judge in @entity0 said he is set to rule within the next two days on whether to lift the @entity3 - ordered moratorium on deepwater drilling			1
@entity42 district court judge @entity66 said he will issue his decision between early tuesday and wednesday afternoon on whether to issue a preliminary injunction against the temporary ban			1
the six - month moratorium , instituted by the government last month , halts all drilling in more than 500 feet of water and prevents new permits from being issued			1
backers say it is necessary while a safety review is conducted after the @entity39 explosion			0
opponents dispute its necessity and call it economically devastating in a region that is already reeling			0
@entity83 , a company that provides boats and equipment to the offshore drilling industry , says in the lawsuit that the government has no evidence that existing operations pose a threat to the @entity9			1
@entity92 and other oil service companies named as plaintiffs in the case say they want a court to declare the moratorium invalid and unenforceable			2
the office of @entity1 gov. @entity100 has filed a friend of the court brief in support of the plaintiffs			0
@entity105 , an attorney for the plaintiffs , said monday that the moratorium is " an unprecedented industry - wide shutdown with the stroke of a pen			1
" " this is about industry survival for deepwater drilling in the @entity9 , " he said			1
@entity105 said the airline industry was grounded for only three days after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001			0
@entity117 , an attorney for the state of @entity1 , complained that @entity1 officials had not been consulted before the moratorium was enacted			2
" this is environmental disaster			0
let 's not make an economic disaster , " he said			2
@entity125 , an attorney for the @entity126 , insisted the suspension was necessary because it " assures the public time to evaluate safety measures			0
" @entity8 has agreed to set aside $ 100 million to compensate oil workers idled by the moratorium , company chairman @entity130 said last week			1
a senior administration official told @entity2 on monday the @entity134 pushed for that compensation fund			2
" we believed we had legal means to push them on funds for workers affected by the moratorium , and they ultimately agreed to set $ 100 million aside , " the official said			1
@entity8 said in a statement monday that costs from the disaster now total about $ 2 billion , including the cost of the response , containment , relief well drilling , grants to @entity150 , claims paid and federal costs			1
to date , more than 65,000 claims have been submitted and more than 32,000 payments totaling more than $ 105 million have been made , the company said			0
however , the man overseeing a $ 20 billion claims fund told @entity2 on monday that he wants the claims payment process accelerated and its transparency increased			2
" we 've got to get the claims out quicker , we 've got to get them out with more transparency so claimants understand the status of their claim , and we 've got to ease the burden on these folks in the @entity9 , " @entity160 said during an interview with @entity162 on @entity2 's " @entity163			2
" emergency payments , he said , need to go out " with less corroboration than you would if you 're giving a lump - sum payment that is the total compensation			0
for the emergency payments , we 've got to err on the side of the plaintiff			0
" critics of the @entity22 administration have questioned @entity160 's independence , saying he is on the @entity134 payroll as executive compensation czar			2
that is wrong , @entity160 said : " i 'm not on the payroll			0
i 'm doing the @entity134 pay czar role pro bono , without compensation			0
... i do n't think anybody will ultimately question the independence of this program			0
" @entity8 , meanwhile , continues to struggle with its public relations efforts after the @entity9 spill			0
@entity195 ceo @entity194 , who was grilled during an appearance before @entity197 last week and then strongly criticized for attending a yacht race over the weekend , will not attend tuesday 's @entity197 in @entity199 , according to a @entity8 spokesman			2
the spokesman cited @entity194 's " commitment to the @entity9 relief effort " as the reason for his decision not to attend the meeting			2
@entity2 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report			0
