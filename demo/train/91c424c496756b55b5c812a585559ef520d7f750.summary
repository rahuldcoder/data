one might think democrats are in disarray , given the recent legislative battle that pitted the @entity5 administration and @entity7 majority leader @entity6 against top @entity9 democrat @entity8 and @entity11 sen. @entity10			1
not so , argue @entity13 sen. @entity12 and outgoing @entity11 gov. @entity14			1
" the differences among @entity1 are small compared to the huge chasm of @entity20 , " @entity12 said to @entity15 on @entity17 's " @entity16 " on sunday			1
" you look on issues like minimum wage and equal pay and infrastructure construction , helping people pay for college -- the @entity28 is unified			1
" @entity12 called economic issues " the soul of the @entity28 " and reiterated his belief that party members are on the same page -- name - checking @entity33 , a newly minted member of the @entity1 ' leadership team			1
" @entity10 is , even if people do n't agree with her , she 's constructive , " he said of the senator who advocated for @entity28 opposition to a spending measure because she felt it rolled by banking regulations			2
" she 's not like @entity42 saying , ' shut down the government or do n't fund things if i do n't get my way			0
' " @entity14 , in a separate interview with @entity15 , said @entity1 suffered heavy losses in the 2014 midterm elections because they lacked a resonating economic message , not because of an emerging rift			1
" it 's a broad - based party			2
we are very specific about the things that we need to do economically and socially to enable people to get a toehold in the middle class and to hang on once they get there , " he said			0
" and i think that that 's a very powerful story			0
and when we tell it , we win			0
" @entity14 , a self - described " pro-growth progressive " offered support for @entity33 generally , but advocated for a balance between government help and private market principles			0
" i just do n't believe that markets solve every problem in everybody 's life and i do n't think government solves every problem in everybody 's life , " @entity14 said			0
but with groups on the left envigorated by @entity33 's @entity80 rhetoric and @entity8 willing to buck @entity5 's @entity9 , there 's evidence @entity1 may splinter yet .			2

top @entity1 argue the party *remains* unified in wake of legislative *skirmish*
sen. @entity12 calls economic issues " the soul of the @entity28 "
