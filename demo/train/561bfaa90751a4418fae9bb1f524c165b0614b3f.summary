@entity0 , @entity1 -- tens of thousands of people chanted anti-government slogans monday before the funeral of a top @entity1 cleric who turned into one of the regime 's most vocal critics , a witness said			1
they shouted " death to the dictator ! " outside the home of senior @entity1 dissident grand ayatollah @entity14 , who died early sunday			1
@entity14 -- a key figure in @entity1 's @entity19 30 years ago -- was perhaps the most prominent cleric who publicly criticized the presidential elections last june that returned hard - liner @entity21 to the presidency			1
protesters and mourners began to gather near his home in this holy city around 7 a.m. , swelling to huge numbers by the time the funeral procession began , said the witness			0
both uniformed and plain clothes security forces turned out for the funeral , with the undercover officers arriving in several buses and mingling with the crowds			0
the witness did not see any clashes but said tensions were high as protesters stood and chanted just steps away from security forces			0
many of the protesters and mourners had driven to @entity0 , where @entity14 lived , from @entity43 and other cities hundreds of miles away , the witness said			1
mourners from @entity46 , @entity14 's hometown , passed out dates , an @entity1 tradition at funerals			1
the night before the funeral , chants of " @entity52 is great " -- which the opposition uses as a rallying cry -- could be heard in several @entity43 neighborhoods			2
the chants were louder than usual , witnesses said			0
around 300 to 400 people gathered at @entity43 's @entity61 and lit candles on sunday night in memory of @entity14 , several sources told @entity2			1
the witnesses did not see any clashes between security forces and the people at the gathering			0
@entity2 is not naming its sources to protect their security			0
writing on his web site after the disputed june presidential elections , @entity14 described the street protests that followed the polling as a challenge to the " very legitimacy of the @entity77			1
" his death is " a terrible blow for the ( reformist ) green movement and everybody who has been active these past few months , " said @entity83 , a senior research consultant at the @entity84 for @entity86 and @entity1 studies in @entity87			1
" he was a very senior grand ayatollah with very good revolutionary credentials , and a very vocal critic of the ruling establishment , " @entity83 said			1
" he was a major thorn in the back of ( @entity1 supreme leader @entity94			2
he was a bastion for all the people opposing the excesses of the system , " even within the ruling establishment , he said			0
in the last six months , @entity14 had become the voice of the green movement on key foreign policy issues , @entity83 said			2
the cleric was able to comment more freely than reformist presidential candidates			2
@entity14 , for example , took a public stand against nuclear weapons in october , issuing a fatwa , or religious edict , declaring them to be " un-islamic " and instructing @entity111 to take the lead in banning them , said @entity113 , diplomatic editor of the weekly newspaper @entity115 in @entity87			2
@entity1 's nuclear program has been the subject of intense international concern , with the @entity119 considering expanding sanctions against the @entity122 state despite its insistence it does not intend to build a bomb			1
" he has a very large public following especially since the june elections and all his statements in favor of human rights , " @entity113 said @entity14 's web site called for a funeral procession from his home to the @entity133 in @entity0 , the holy city where he lived , starting at 9 a.m. on monday ( 12:30 a.m. et )			1
demonstrations at the burial could spill over into the capital , @entity113 said			0
" @entity140 is very close to @entity43 and this is a major event , " she said , adding that it is difficult to predict what would happen			0
" it would be questionable how a lot of the foot soldiers of the revolution would react			0
" the timing of his death could also be significant , she said , since it comes in the month that first saw the demonstrations that spiraled into the revolution that toppled the monarchy and brought the @entity122 regime to power			1
@entity14 was once a confidant of @entity156 , who led @entity1 for a decade after the revolution			1
he studied under @entity156 and then acted as his representative in @entity1 after @entity156 was exiled by the shah for criticizing the monarchy , @entity113 said			1
@entity14 , too , was jailed and exiled			2
after the revolution , he was the heir apparent to @entity156 , and played a key role in writing @entity1 's constitution as the first chair of the powerful @entity165			1
he was also the leader of friday prayers in @entity43 , one of the most public and influential pulpits in the country			0
but he was supplanted by the current supreme leader , ayatollah @entity170 , and was placed under several years of house arrest in 1997			0
" his problems with @entity156 started in the summer of 1988 when they started executing ... thousands of leftist prisoners , " @entity113 said			1
" he never was in agreement with that , and then he started to fade " from power			0
" once @entity94 became leader , @entity14 objected , " she said			2
@entity14 said @entity94 " was elevated above his ( religious ) qualifications , " pointing out that he had not earned the title of ayatollah			1
" it was then he was arrested			0
" recently he has objected to the current regime 's characterization of his one - time mentor khomeini as a saint , she added			0
and following the disputed elections in june , " he issued a ground - breaking fatwa articulating the policies of the ( reformist ) green movement to the world			2
@entity14 had been equally critical of the parliamentary electoral process in 2004 , arguing in favor of reformist candidates			2
sitting behind his desk with a government minder in the room , he said then that @entity1 's @entity122 revolution had lost its way			1
" even i , who used to be a leading figure in the revolution , have not the right to speak out , " he said			0
" @entity206 will never last long			0
the gentlemen in power must submit to the wishes of the people , or they will be swept away			0
" @entity2 's @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report .			0
