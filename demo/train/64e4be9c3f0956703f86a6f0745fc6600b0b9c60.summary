the @entity2 's harsh interrogations of terrorist detainees during the @entity5 era did n't work , were more brutal than previously revealed and delivered no " ticking time bomb " information that prevented an attack , according to an explosive @entity10 report released tuesday			1
the majority report issued by the @entity12 is a damning condemnation of the tactics -- branded by critics as torture -- the @entity5 administration deployed in the fear - laden days after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks			1
the techniques , according to the report , were " deeply flawed , " poorly managed and often resulted in " fabricated " information			1
the report is reigniting the partisan divide over combating terrorism that dominated @entity25 a decade ago			2
@entity26 argue the tactics conflict with @entity29 values while leading members of the @entity5 administration insist they were vital to preventing another attack			1
the @entity2 immediately hit back at the report , saying in a statement that the program was " effective " and substantially helped its understanding of @entity38 's tactical operations and goals			1
but president @entity40 said the report reinforced his view that the harsh interrogation methods " were not only inconsistent with our values as a nation , they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests			1
" in its most graphic details , an executive summary of the report finds that conditions for detainees at top secret overseas interrogation sites were much harsher than the @entity2 has previously admitted			1
it finds that high value detainees were subjected to methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation " in near nonstop fashion for days or weeks at a time			0
" " in many cases , the most aggressive techniques were used immediately , in combination and nonstop , " the report says			1
" sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours , usually standing or in painful stress positions , at times with their hands shackled above their heads			0
" in one facility , a detainee was said to have died of hypothermia after being held " partially nude " and chained to a concrete floor , while at other times , naked prisoners were hooded and dragged up and down corridors while being slapped and punched			0
multiple @entity2 detainees subjected to the techniques suffered from hallucinations , paranoia , insomnia and tried to mutilate themselves , the report says			1
on one occasion , high - value @entity38 suspect @entity86 became completely unresponsive after a period of intense waterboarding			0
he had " bubbles rising through his open full mouth , " the report says			2
meanwhile , the confessed mastermind of the september 11 attacks , @entity96 , was subjected to a " series of near drownings			0
" the report finds that at least 119 detainees went through the @entity2 detention program and at least 26 were held " wrongfully , " partly because there was no information to justify their detention			1
previously , the @entity2 had said only 100 prisoners had been processed through the program , @entity26 @entity10 aides said			1
the report suggests that the controversial enhanced interrogation techniques did not produce information necessary to save lives that was not already available from other means			1
that is important because supporters of the program have always said that it was vital to obtaining actionable intelligence from detainees that could not be extracted through conventional interrogations			0
it also discounts @entity2 claims in 2011 that enhanced interrogation of @entity38 operative @entity123 produced information which led them to @entity127 's " courier " @entity128			1
the breakthrough , which eventually helped the agency track down the @entity38 leader 's hideout in @entity134 , @entity135 , was extracted before @entity123 was subjected to harsh treatment , the report said , in its scathing response to the report -- released even before @entity12 chairwoman @entity140 rose on the @entity10 floor to unveil it -- the @entity2 said it was " unknowable " whether it could have received the same information from terror suspects using alternative methods			1
it said the conclusions of the report contained " too many flaws " for it to " stand as official record of the program " and said many of the charges were " based on authors ' flawed analysis of the value of the intelligence obtained from the detainees			2
" @entity40 outlawed enhanced interrogation techniques soon after becoming president in 2009 and admitted in august " we tortured some folks			1
" as commander in chief , he faces many of the same dilemmas on how to fight terrorism as his predecessor			0
but the tone of his response to the report was nevertheless critical			2
he acknowledged in his statement that the @entity5 administration had faced " agonizing choices about how to pursue @entity38 and prevent additional terrorist attacks against our country			0
" " our nation did many things right in those difficult years			0
at the same time , some of the actions that were taken were contrary to our values			2
" @entity140 said that the @entity2 's actions in the aftermath of 9/11 were a " stain on our values and on our history			1
" " the release of this 500 - page summary can not remove that stain , but it can and does say to our people and the world that @entity29 is big enough to admit when it 's wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes , " she said			0
in april , three republicans on the @entity12 voted to declassify the report			1
but @entity197 sen. @entity196 , the committee 's top @entity198 member , also released a minority rebuttal to the document , taking issues with its methodology and findings			0
the rebuttal said the report created the " false impression that the @entity2 was actively misleading policy makers and impeding the counterterrorism efforts of other federal government agencies during the @entity212 's operation			1
" director of national intelligence @entity213 said he did not believe that " any other nation would go to the lengths the @entity29 does to bare its soul , admit mistakes when they are made and learn from those mistakes			0
" thousands of marines at @entity29 diplomatic posts and military bases around the world are on alert amid fears the graphic details of how detainees were treated could spark a violent backlash			0
but there was little initial interest on @entity232 forums about the report , said @entity234 , a senior analyst at @entity235 , a @entity29 organization that tracks @entity232 websites			0
intelligence sources told @entity0 's @entity239 correspondent @entity238 , however , that the threat of retaliatory attacks could come in days rather than hours , as information filters across the world			0
those sources added that currently , there is no specific threat			0
the full report is more than 6,000 pages long			0
but after a prolonged tussle between the @entity2 and the committee over how much of the material should be classified , the document being released tuesday is 480 pages long			2
senior members of the @entity5 administration have also voiced disquiet that the report is being released and defended their actions , those of administration lawyers and @entity2 agents charged with the interrogations			1
former president @entity5 told @entity0 's @entity262 last week that the @entity29 was " fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the @entity2 serving on our behalf			2
" " these are good people			0
" former vice president @entity269 told the @entity270 that claims that the @entity2 was out of bounds or that the interrogation program was a rogue operations were " a bunch of hooey			2
" " the program was authorized			0
the agency did not want to proceed without authorization , and it was also reviewed legally by the @entity279 before they undertook the program , " @entity269 said			0
countries that cooperated with the @entity2 , hosting black site prisons and assisting in transferring detainees , are identified only obliquely and not by name			2
@entity2 employees , referred to by pseudonyms in the report , are n't being identified			1
however , the agency pushed for the pseudonyms to be redacted because other information in the report could be used to determine who the employees are			0
for some republicans and @entity2 supporters , there 's still a dispute about whether techniques such as waterboarding constitute torture			1
the @entity279 twice has investigated the conduct of @entity2 employees involved in the program and decided not to bring charges			2
@entity0 's @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 contributed to this report .			0
