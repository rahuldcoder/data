-- former @entity3 prime minister @entity2 's attempt to spread the festive cheer turned into a turkey after social media users mocked his new @entity8 card			1
@entity2 issued his annual @entity8 card on monday			1
it features a photo of him , with a forced grimace on his face , standing next to his wife @entity14 alongside the caption " @entity16			0
" the unnatural - looking smile quickly became the source of online derision , with @entity21 users quick to compare the image to a range of gurning icons , from @entity25 from " @entity26 " and " friends ' " @entity28			1
@ carlmaxim noted that " the strange thing about @entity2 's @entity8 card is how the teeth seem to follow you round the room			1
" other users decided to do their own version of the card			0
some took the opportunity for some -- admittedly outdated -- political satire			0
user @ @entity44 superimposed @entity2 's successor @entity46 's face onto @entity2 's and tweeted " come on @entity47 , it 's my turn , " a reference to @entity46 waiting for @entity2 to step down as prime minister and repeatedly telling him , " it 's my turn now			2
" others took the culture route , with @ @entity53 superimposing the couple 's faces onto @entity56 and @entity57 , while @ garboy photoshopped their faces onto the notoriously unsmiling @entity61 painting " @entity62			0
" when asked about the card , a spokesperson for @entity2 's office told @entity0 : " we do not ' officially ' release the card , cards are sent to their friends and colleagues , which does n't seem to me to be that unusual a process let alone one which merits such interest			2

@entity2 's @entity8 card features the former @entity3 *pm* 's unnatural grin
@entity21 users were quick to mock the image
*copycat* cards on the theme were also quick to emerge
