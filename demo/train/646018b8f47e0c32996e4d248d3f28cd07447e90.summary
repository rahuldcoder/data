@entity0 , @entity1 -- tourism and wildlife officials want the slaughter to stop			2
private security armies and the @entity1 military have cracked down			1
still , rhinos are being killed in @entity1 alone at a rate exceeding one a day , a rate that has already made one species of rhino extinct and threatens the two others			1
tourism chiefs and wildlife protection groups say both black and white rhinos face extinction because of poaching to meet demand from @entity19 where powdered rhino horn is used as a medicine , and the @entity22 , where the horn is valued for decoration			1
exact prices are hard to gauge but some say a kilogram of rhino horn is more valuable than gold , though that is disputed by others looking into the murky black market			1
in 2011 , more than 340 rhinos have been killed so far in @entity1 -- more than for the whole of 2010 which was itself a record year , according to the @entity34			2
@entity1 's western black rhino is now officially extinct , according to a review of animals and plants published last week in the @entity40 's @entity39			1
now , some involved in the @entity1 wildlife tourism industry are talking about extreme measures to curb the poaching			0
one idea suggested by a park owner , but not acted on , is to insert a poisoned rhino horn into the illegal trade -- so that end consumers would fall ill. another suggestion is to make some trade in rhino horn legal because unlike elephant ivory it is possible to take a rhino 's horn without killing the animal -- although the poachers rarely leave their animal victims alive			1
@entity60 , head of the @entity0 , believes the illegal trade might have spiked as an unintended consequence of tough regulations on legal hunting			0
in @entity1 's @entity66 , the military is deployed along the @entity68 border to stop the poachers			1
while successful in terms of reducing the rhino kills in that area , it has also led to poachers targeting privately - owned game parks instead where security for the animal is a big expense that not all of them can afford			1
the bigger private parks have their own armed security and electrified fences ; @entity60 says the @entity0 is looking at using drones or radar , but for smaller parks the costs of protecting rhinos is becoming exorbitant			2
dr. @entity89 , a veterinarian at @entity90 , said : " we have to get rid of the trade in @entity19			0
we 're wasting time and funds doing it here			0
we 're possibly slowing down the extinction of the rhino			0
but you 're not going to stop it			0
" in @entity1 where we have good protection of our rhinos , good reporting of when they are shot , we are losing approximately one every 21 hours			1
" in @entity19 the trade in rhino horn is believed to be dominated by organized gangs from places like @entity108 , say @entity1 wildlife officials			1
@entity111 horn is culturally believed to have an array of medicinal qualities			0
some internet ads even claim it can be used as a cancer treatment			0
back in @entity1 , people like @entity60 and groups like @entity34 want stiff sentences for poachers and the people who employ them			2
almost everyone involved in the fight against poaching says they can understand why a poor , unemployed man desperate to feed his family would be tempted into the illegal business			0
reserves such as @entity129 are trying to educate their poorer neighbors that rhinos can attract tourism dollars over the long - term but horn poaching can only be lucrative until the last rhino is killed			2
these poor poachers often sneak onto the private game parks to secure the prized horns , but wildlife officials like @entity139 , head of poaching unit in @entity141 , are very worried about the emergence of other hunters , apparently with money behind them , who hire helicopters and gun down rhinos with high - powered rifles			0
@entity60 says these poachers need to face the full force of the law and long jail sentences before it is too late for the rhinos .			0

one rhino is killed in @entity1 every 21 hours threatening the the *future* of the species
the military and heavily - armed security *guards* are fighting the poachers
