@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's lower house passed a marijuana legalization bill wednesday , bringing the @entity6 nation one step closer to becoming the first to legally regulate production , distribution and sale of the drug			1
after more than 12 hours of debate , the bill garnered the 50 votes it needed to pass in the @entity15			0
forty - six lawmakers voted against the bill			0
the country 's senate is expected to take up the measure in october			1
president @entity21 has said he backs the bill , which would allow marijuana to be sold in pharmacies and create a registry of those who buy it			1
only those 18 and older would be allowed to purchase the drug			2
he told @entity2 en @entity29 last year that he supported legalizing marijuana			2
" if we legalize it , we think that we will spoil the market ( for drug traffickers ) because we are going to sell it for cheaper than it is sold on the black market , " he said			1
" and we are going to have people identified			0
" conservative critics of the measure have said it promotes drug addiction and have suggested that @entity43 's comments were uninformed			1
supporters of the measure , including the @entity47 coalition of left - wing political parties , have said it will fight criminal drug trafficking and marks a turning point and could influence other @entity53 nations to take a similar approach			1
" this implies the materialization of a new paradigm in terms of drug policies , " said @entity55 , director for @entity53 of @entity56			2

marijuana use is legal in @entity1 , but production and sale of the drug is not			1
supporters of the country 's legalization measure call that a paradox			1
" the consumption of marijuana has been allowed for 40 years , but it can only be accessed through the narcos , and requires the commission of a crime , in addition to the exposure to other drugs , " the @entity47 said in a statement on its website			2
" we have created a great business for drug trafficking , and that is what we want to start to fight			2
" in recent years , legalization measures have gained growing traction among some @entity53 leaders amid rising violence many tie to the drug war			0
