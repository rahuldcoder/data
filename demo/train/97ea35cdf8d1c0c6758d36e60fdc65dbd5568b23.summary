at first glance , @entity1 -- a 10 - year - old @entity0 crested dog -- is a rather unappealing and unfortunate - looking animal			1
with a few random hairs protruding from his snout , a pair of squinty , beady eyes and thin , patchy skin , his genetics did n't do much for his exterior			2
but beauty is n't skin deep			0
and that is exactly what photographer @entity17 wants to portray through her pictures of @entity1			1

@entity1 has also appeared on television too many times to count , and he 's even been to @entity65 to switch on the @entity67 lights			2
" @entity1 's life is far from being an ordinary dog 's life , " @entity20 said			1
" he is more like a movie star			1
" when @entity20 first decided to profile the dog , she thought he was ugly , too , she admits			0
