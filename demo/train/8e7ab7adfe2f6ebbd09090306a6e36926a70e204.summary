-- while the rest of the world last week was fixating on the chimney atop the @entity4 , waiting to see whether the smoke would be black or white , it was n't the smoke that intrigued me			2
it was the stuff that was making the smoke			0
the cardinals , after casting their ballots in each round of voting for the new pope , burned those ballots , as is tradition			0
the burning ballots created the smoke the world witnessed billowing from the chimney			0
the ballots , of course , were made of paper			2
which sometimes seems like an endangered species			0
had the cardinals voted on @entity29 , they could n't very well have tossed the sleek tablets into the chapel 's cast - iron stove			2
yet an all - but - paperless society is where some experts argue we are headed			0
the digital upheaval has gathered such force that every business that once depended on paper has felt the earth shift			1
newspapers , magazine publishers , book companies , bookstores , offices of every kind ... the transition to digital is beginning to feel as profound as the revolution once ushered in by the invention of moveable type			2
the @entity53 recently noted the precipitous decline of the @entity56 paper industry : " @entity58 towns in the forest from eastern @entity60 to the coast of @entity62 have lost more than 100 paper mills in a wave of consolidation in little more than a decade ... @entity56 demand for three types of [ coated ] paper [ has ] fallen 21 percent			1
" the @entity69 last year quoted equity analyst @entity70 : " there 's a secular shift to paperless			2
it 's an overarching mind - set			2
" all of this echoes a 2011 projection by the research firm @entity79 , which advises the global forest products industry : " by 2015 , most publishing paper end uses in @entity56 , such as magazine , newspaper and book publishing , will fall 12 - 21 percent , compared to their 2010 levels			1
" the firm went on to project " another 40 - 50 percent fall over the next 15 years			1
" thus , there is a special fascination to a promotional campaign developed in recent years by @entity90 , one of the world 's largest manufacturers of paper			1
the campaign is not just for @entity90 products -- it is for paper itself , no matter where it comes from or who sells it			1
the theme is : " paper because			0
" the campaign , hoping to persuade people , proclaims : " paper is good			1
" it offers heartfelt reasons : " paper means that you mean business			0
" " paper is personal			0
" " sometimes understanding the big picture means spreading it all out on the floor			0
" " opening a nice envelope is surprisingly exciting			0
" i hasten to say that i 'm not knocking those messages -- i agree with every word of them			0
i just find it illuminating , and more than a little melancholy , that we have reached the point at which those messages are deemed necessary -- the point at which the paper industry feels a need to convince people that paper is important			1
before the digital age , the presence of such a campaign would have been puzzling			1
tell people that paper is essential to their lives ? what else were they supposed to write on -- rocks , using carving tools ? it would have been like running promotional campaigns for air , or for water			1
such things did not need promotion -- they were indispensable			0
( and , of course , there is the fact that , as clever and well executed as the " paper because " campaign is , i found it and browsed through it completely online , on a screen			1
) a screen is where you are almost undoubtedly reading these words , too			0
but before i hit the button to send my editors every column , i print out a copy and do the editing and proofreading by hand , on sheets of paper , with a pen			0
i love the breadth and scope of @entity0 's digital reach -- the speed and efficiency with which the stories on this site are delivered around the globe makes me think of it as a planetary paperboy with the strongest arm in the world			1
but there 's something about paper			1
i 'm currently about halfway through a copy of @entity187 , cover date september 25 , 1950 ( yes , i 'm a little behind on my reading , but i 'm slowly catching up )			0
i 'll often buy old magazines not just because i find them to be a wonderful way to delve randomly into @entity56 's history at precise moments in time , but also because , at the end of a day spent staring at shifting , constantly updating images on multiple screens , there is something calming about holding carefully laid out and edited sheets of paper , and luxuriating in the steadiness of it all			1
maybe you 're the same way			0
perhaps the magic of paper , and all it has always represented , is something you could just as well do without -- a source of clutter and mustiness			1
but as magazines and newspapers and books and business offices and schools make their inexorable leap into the digital future , there 's nothing wrong with acknowledging just how nice the tactile , comforting , here - when - you - want - me world of words and pictures on paper has been , even while recognizing and appreciating the marvels of the new way			1
i 'm very glad that you 've found your way to these words on whatever screen you may be reading them , and i do n't think any of us are fooling ourselves into thinking the paper - to - digital course will suddenly be reversed			1
to use a phrase connected to another once - ubiquitous part of our daily lives : that train has left the station			0
but you have to hope that the departure has not been total , or at least that it wo n't become total for a good , long time			0
in that promotional campaign , there is one line that is meant to be perky and cheerful -- a line that somehow also sounds kind of bittersweet : " hi			2
remember me ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			2

@entity250 : with advent of digital age , paper use and demand has dropped like rock
in fact , by 2015 paper use could fall 21 **%** -- and then over 40 **%** more in the 15 years after
he says new ad campaign ( you 'll likely read online ) makes *plaintive* case for paper 's value
@entity250 : one can marvel at , use digital media , but save spot in your heart for *beauty* of paper
