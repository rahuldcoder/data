-- over the weekend the @entity1 launched drone strikes in two different locations in @entity4 , killing at least 15 militants as well as three civilians			1
at the same time , @entity4 ground forces began what have been termed " unprecedented " operations against @entity11 's affiliate in @entity4 , which may also involve additional @entity1 drone strikes , although that is n't clear right now			1
the @entity1 drone campaign in @entity4 is very much president @entity16 's war			1
unlike in @entity18 , where president @entity19 significantly ramped up the @entity21 drone campaign while he was in office , there was only one drone strike in @entity4 during @entity19 's two terms in office			2
during @entity16 's administration , there have been 92 drone attacks , as well as a further 15 @entity1 strikes using other forms of weaponry such as cruise missiles , according to a count by the @entity34			2
indeed , @entity16 vastly accelerated the drone campaign in @entity4 in 2011 and 2012 , just as @entity21 drone strikes in @entity18 began to slow			1
forty - seven strikes took place in @entity4 in 2012 , marking the first time the number of drone strikes in @entity4 and @entity18 reached comparable levels			1
one reason for this acceleration in drone strikes in @entity4 may have been @entity16 's authorization in april 2012 of the " signature " strikes that had been approved the previous year for use in @entity18 's tribal regions			1
such strikes do not target known militants but rather people who are displaying the behaviors of suspected militants			2
such signature strikes were reportedly governed by stricter rules in @entity4 than in @entity18 , though , and were given a different name : @entity59 , or terrorist attack disruption strikes			2
as of monday , @entity1 drone and air strikes have killed an estimated 753 to 965 people in @entity4 , of whom the large majority were militants , but at least 81 were civilians , according to the @entity34 study			1
all but six of the many hundreds of victims of the strikes were killed under the @entity16 administration			0
the drone program in @entity4 began in earnest after a series of attempted terrorist attacks against the @entity1 were traced back to @entity11 's @entity4 - based affiliate , @entity76			2
@entity76 claimed responsibility for the would - be " underwear bomb " attack on a @entity80 - bound flight by @entity81 on christmas day 2009			0
fortunately for the people on board @entity85 that day , @entity81 's bomb was a dud , and he succeeded only in burning himself rather than destroying a commercial airliner			0
had his bomb exploded as intended , it would have been the most devastating terrorist attack on the @entity1 since 9/11			0
less than a year later , @entity76 mailed two packages with bombs cleverly disguised inside @entity94 printer cartridges from a @entity96 office and @entity98 facility in @entity4 to the street addresses of two synagogues in @entity101			0
the toner in the printer cartridges had been replaced by the high explosive petn			0
the bombs were almost impossible to detect as the explosives were odorless and the circuitry for the detonator looked like ordinary wiring			0
both devices were discovered on october 29 , 2010 , before they could detonate , one in @entity111 and the other at a @entity114 airport			0
they were discovered because of very specific information about the tracking numbers of both packages that was provided by the @entity118 , who had managed to plant a spy in the ranks of @entity76			0
the bomb - maker believed responsible for these cleverly designed bombs is @entity124			1
according to a senior @entity1 official , @entity124 is proving hard to find , as he avoids any form of electronic communication and communicates only by courier			0
another senior @entity1 official says @entity124 has been experimenting with bombs that can be implanted in suicide bombers using surgical techniques			0
@entity133 is the most important target in @entity4 for @entity1 intelligence , although senior @entity1 officials say he has also trained others in @entity11 in advanced bomb - making , so his techniques may survive should he be killed in a drone strike			1
during the @entity16 administration , @entity1 drones have killed 35 key @entity11 militants in @entity4 , including the @entity4 - @entity1 cleric @entity144 , who directed @entity76 's operations against the @entity1 before he was killed in 2011 drone strike			1
unlike in @entity18 , where political leaders have condemned the strikes , @entity4 president @entity149 said during an interview with the @entity151 in 2012 that he personally signs off on all @entity1 drone strikes in @entity4 and that they hit their targets accurately , asserting , " the drone technologically is more advanced than the human brain			1
" yet some of the popular resentment toward the @entity1 drone campaign that has long festered in @entity18 is beginning to emerge in @entity4			1
on april 23 , 2013 , the @entity159 held the first public hearing dedicated to the legal issues surrounding the @entity1 drone campaign			2
one of the six who testified was @entity163 , a young @entity4 activist who spent his high school years in the @entity1			2
@entity165 told the committee that a drone strike had targeted his village of @entity169 just six days earlier			0
" what radicals had previously failed to achieve in my village , " @entity163 told the senators , " one drone strike accomplished in an instant : there is now an intense anger and growing hatred of @entity1			0

suspected @entity1 drone strikes hit two different locations in @entity4
@entity183 says strikes are part of an *aggressive* war by @entity1 against militants
estimates are that up to *950* people have been killed , including more than 80 civilians
@entity193 : war is *focusing* on bomb - maker believed to have designed devices aimed at @entity1
