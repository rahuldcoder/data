-- one man 's trash is another man 's mystery			2
@entity5 holds what he believes are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts from @entity10			1
five years ago , @entity5 's rubbish removal company was hired to clean out a @entity13 apartment following the death of the owner , abstract artist @entity15			1
the contents of a barrel that @entity18 salvaged from the trash then has today raised a series of questions			2
what @entity18 holds are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts that he thinks are from @entity10 , dating to between 300 b.c. and 500 a.d. the mystery , which the @entity26 in @entity27 is trying to solve , is twofold : how much are the artifacts worth ? and , if authentic , whom do they belong to ? @entity18 first saw the collection of pottery and figurines while cleaning @entity15 's apartment in 2004			1
he stored the barrel in his warehouse instead of disposing of it , then promptly forgot about it			2
last week , @entity18 rediscovered the pieces , only this time he told the @entity42 about what he had found , announcing that he would sell them			0
that caught the attention of the @entity10 government , which is studying the origins of the items and has claimed them			1
now , @entity18 wants to donate his find , but not necessarily to @entity10 , he told @entity0			1
the @entity53 native was excited about his discovery when he allowed representatives from the @entity56 to examine and photograph nearly all the pieces , @entity5 said			2
his curiosity about them was growing , and he was expecting an appraisal from the government officials			0
what he got instead was a heads - up about a possible petition to return the entire collection to @entity10			1
" my reaction is that that is not very diplomatic , " @entity5 said			2
" it 's a blow to the jaw			0
" @entity70 , @entity10 's consul general in @entity27 , was not available for comment tuesday			2
however in an interview with the @entity75 - based @entity74 - language tv network @entity73 , he said that if the pieces are part of @entity10 culture , the government will try to get them back			1
but as of now , no one is certain what the pieces are			0
@entity84 , an ancient art dealer who does appraisals , examined a handful of the pieces that @entity18 holds			0
@entity84 told @entity0 he saw a mix of authentic and non-authentic @entity90 pieces , which he valued at $ 3,000			0
the pieces were broken and were n't very artistic , he said , adding " from what i can see , it was mostly junk			0
" unfazed , @entity5 thinks all the pieces probably are worth more than $ 16,000 total , he said			1
" something like this , you ca n't put a price on , because i may have a figure that no one has seen before , " @entity5 said			2
" there 's a big value in these pieces			0
" the @entity10 government is n't taking any chances , and is conducting its own research into the authenticity and significance of the pieces			1
museums in @entity110 , @entity111 ; @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , have expressed interest in the pieces as well , @entity5 said			1
he said he 'd like to donate the artifacts to museums across the country , and some to the @entity56 at the @entity26 in @entity27 , but that could change if @entity10 uses international law to claim the items			1
the foundation that hired @entity18 to clean the house is unlikely to try to reclaim the pieces , said @entity125 , the attorney who handled @entity15 's estate			0
when @entity15 died , he left all his possessions to his lifelong partner , @entity128 , @entity125 told @entity0			0
in turn , @entity128 bequeathed all of @entity15 's possessions to a foundation " to carry out his artistic legacy , " he said			0
@entity15 had some pieces from @entity10 in his apartment that were cataloged , but the artist had no strong connection to the country , @entity125 said			1
for @entity18 , all the fuss stems from a simple truth			0
" sometimes you find things that are good and salvageable in the trash , " he said .			0

@entity5 finds @entity10 artifacts worth *thousands* in trash barrel
@entity149 belonged to deceased abstract artist @entity150
@entity10 government claims it owns artifacts , seeks their return
@entity5 says he wants to donate artifacts to museums across @entity75
