@entity0 , @entity1 -- something in the lakes around @entity0 , @entity1 , has claimed the lives of three boys this summer			1
@entity7 ' family says he died after being exposed to a deadly amoeba on a @entity1 lake			1
" this thing is just there			0
it 's lurking like some deadly thing in the water which can take our children 's lives and we all have to be aware , " said @entity13 health department director dr. @entity12			1
the " thing " is n't a fish or alligator			0
it is so small it can not be seen with the naked eye			0
the killer that lives in the hot , fresh water is a single cell amoeba that once exposed to the human brain through the nasal passages is almost always fatal			1
at first people exposed to the amoeba , naegleria fowleri , suffer from flu - like symptoms			1
very quickly , in from one to 14 days , the symptoms worsen , @entity12 said			2
" there 's a downhill course			0
folks lapse into a coma ; there are abnormal movements of the eyes and a terrible cascade of events leading to the actual death of parts of the brain			0
" @entity12 said exposure to the amoeba can be detected by an mri and it can be treated with antibiotics if caught early enough , but @entity12 said he believes medical personnel are not in the habit of looking for the disease			2
that is because the amoeba is very rare			2
the @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , has documented 24 cases in the @entity60 since 1989			0
health officials do not know what caused three cases in @entity0 in one summer			1
theories range from warmer temperatures to a drought that has lowered lake levels			1
@entity12 said officials considered closing access to the lakes , but concluded they did not have the authority			1
even if public lakes had been closed , private lakes would have remained open			2
so , at 15 parks and lakes around the city , warnings about the amoeba have been posted			1
the signs urge bathers to wear nose clips or stay out of water warmer than 80 degrees @entity83 , which can be a breeding ground for the amoeba			1
the warnings provide little solace for @entity87			0
health investigators said they believe @entity7 ' 11 - year old son , @entity89 , was exposed to the amoeba during an august weekend spent learning to wakeboard on @entity0 's @entity91			1
" you think it wo n't happen to me , it wo n't happen to my family			0
" you 're wrong " " [ @entity89 's ] symptoms were like a flu bug , " @entity7 said , " we rushed him to the hospital and two days later he 's passed away			1
it 's like a nightmare			0
" a month later , a 10 - year - old boy died from exposure to the amoeba			2
investigators have not determined where he was exposed			0
the death of a 14 year - old boy in june in the @entity0 area also is being blamed on the amoeba			1
as he investigates the deaths of the three boys from the amoeba , @entity12 is concerned these type of deaths may be underreported			2
health departments in @entity1 are not required to report amoeba infections to the state			2
the illness is so rare , he said , it may be commonly misdiagnosed in the @entity60 and internationally			0
he said anyone who exhibits flu - like symptoms who has been in a lake recently should see a doctor immediately			1
speaking in @entity89 's old bedroom , which @entity87 has decorated with photographs of his son , @entity7 said he hopes he can help get the word out			0
he does not want anyone to lose a family member as quickly and mysteriously as he did			0
" it 's the worst thing we ever had to go through and i hate to see any other parent go through this and another child lose his life , " @entity7 said			0
