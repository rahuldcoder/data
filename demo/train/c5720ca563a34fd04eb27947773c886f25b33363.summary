-- i moved to @entity3 earlier this year as @entity0 's correspondent for @entity5 and so far , it 's been everything i expected and more			1
i 've lived abroad a good part of my life and i 've visited some of the most dynamic cities in the world -- from @entity12 to @entity13 to @entity14 -- and i can honestly say that i 've never experienced anything as vibrant , exciting and yes , as challenging , as @entity3			1
recently , i had the pleasure of filling in for @entity17 on @entity0 's @entity18 and while batting around show ideas i mentioned that i had been so busy since arriving here that apart from a few dinners , i had n't really had any time for leisure			1
it was like a light bulb went off			0
why not do a show where i try to find things to do ? but not just anything			0
i would look for activities that i 'd really want to do in my spare time -- which granted , i do n't have a lot of			1
it 's not always easy to find , but if you know where to look , @entity3 offers up almost any activity that you can think of -- golf , sailing and even polo			1
read more : ' @entity39 ' brings @entity40 to world but i 'm not that much of a golfer and while i like watching polo , i wanted to find more accessible activities			0
not one which requires the purchase of a horse			0
for me , staying active is the key to getting rid of any stress that comes on from work , traffic and the incessant power outages			0
and as you can see from my @entity18 show , i am an avid student of the martial arts			0
i started out learning judo when i was six or seven years old and got hooked on taekwondo in my 20s			2
in @entity3 , when it comes to martial arts , taekwondo -- the way of the hand and foot -- rules			1
@entity66 really started to get hooked on the art when @entity68 won the bronze medal at the @entity70 in @entity71			1
watch : taekwondo - ' @entity66 's fastest - growing sport ' in @entity3 , you 'll find most martial artists practicing at @entity75 in @entity76			1
that 's where i met 7th @entity81 black belt @entity79			2
he 's also the president of the @entity83			2
( +234 - 803 - 409 - 3004 )			2
whether you just want to learn how to defend yourself or stay fit by focusing on the sporting / olympic aspect , you 'll find plenty of opportunities to do so in @entity3			1
everyone knows that @entity3 has a notorious traffic problem			1
whenever we are working on a story in and around @entity3 , we always have to factor in the traffic			1
it can take hours to travel even short distances			0
i 'm still getting used to it but i found a place where i can indulge in my " need for speed			0
" @entity97 is a go - kart race track and the only drivers you 'll see are your mates or other patrons that you want to race against			1
watch : go - kart racing in @entity66 after a workout and cruise around the track , i like to head out in the town with the friends i have met here			1
if you 've heard anything about @entity3 it 's probably around its killer nightlife			1
when i started going to some of the nightspots in town , i noticed that everybody -- and i mean everybody , loves to dance			0
unfortunately , i seemed to have been born with two left feet and even my @entity119 roots are not enough to get them moving to the rhythm			0
so i decided to try and learn how to salsa dance			2
enter @entity123 -- the dance instructor of the @entity125 ( 33 @entity127 1st floor , off @entity128 )			0
trained as a lawyer , she 's now following her bliss and teaching both movers and shakers -- and the inept like me			2
watch : changing the perception of dance once you 've got a few moves under your belt , it 's time to hit the scene			1
and you can make that scene at countless bars and nightclubs all over the city			2
there 's something for everyone , from the old expat standby @entity150 's ( @entity149 st. @entity148 ) to the ritzy @entity151 ( @entity152 & suites , @entity154 ) and the rowdy and pulsating @entity155 ( 1310 @entity156 , @entity148 )			2
i personally like to chill out with a nice bottle of wine and some good conversation over at @entity160 ( 19 @entity161			0
it 's a wine bar with great selection and great nibbles to accompany the wines from @entity166 and @entity167			2
one place i have been looking forward to visiting is the @entity170 guest house			0
i play the guitar and i am told that you can sit in with the house band from time to time			0
another journalist i know is prone to bringing his saxophone there and jamming with the band all night long			0
i have only scratched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to having a good time in @entity3			1
i have n't mentioned the beaches , the restaurants or the paintball tournaments			0
but for me , access to the martial arts , dance , nightlife and music feels just like home .			0
