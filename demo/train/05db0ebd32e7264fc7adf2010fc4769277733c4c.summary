-- if i were to admit what went on in my house this morning -- how i raised my voice more than once and slammed the kitchen cabinets after my 8 - year - old daughter kept talking back to me -- how many people would think i 'm a " bad mother " ? probably more than a few			1
i bring up the issue after something that took place very publicly involving the new first lady of @entity12 , @entity13 , wife of mayor @entity15			1
in an in - depth profile in @entity17 on her upbringing , professional experience and relationship with her husband , @entity13 talks oh - so - briefly ( one paragraph in a six - page piece ) about how she struggled with the weight of the responsibilities and the loss of some of her independence when her first child , @entity30 , was born in 1994			1
" i was 40 years old			2
especially with @entity30 -- will we feel guilty forever more ? of course , yes			2
but the truth is , i could not spend every day with her			0
i did n't want to do that			0
i looked for all kinds of reasons not to do it , " said @entity13			0
i have thousands of photos of her -- every 1 - month birthday , 2 - month birthday			0
but i 've been working since i was 14 , and that part of me is me			0
it took a long time for me to get into ' i 'm taking care of kids , ' and what that means			0
" she never said she was a bad mother , mind you , but that did n't stop one @entity12 tabloid from using the label			1
on the front page of the @entity56 , along with a picture of @entity13 , was this nearly full - page headline : " i was a @entity58 ! " the @entity59 had a slightly more restrained take with a smaller photograph on its front page , along with the headline , " did n't want to be a mom			1
" the coverage prompted an unusual move by the mayor , calling a press conference just to denounce the tabloids and demand an apology to his wife			0
a features editor at the @entity59 , who is a new mom herself and just back from maternity leave , defended the coverage in a post , saying the papers did n't make the story up			1
it is what @entity13 said			0
" @entity13 , you 're probably a good mother			1
maybe even a great one			0
but that does n't mean you get to fret about your performance â € ” then complain at how people discuss it , " said @entity81 , the @entity59 features editor			0
but is that what happened ? here was a woman speaking candidly and expressing something that a lot of women can probably relate to and then the media jumped in , using the words " bad mom " and suggesting she did n't want to be a mom , when that 's not the case			1
would the media or anyone else , for that matter , do the same if a man admitted he struggled with balancing parenthood and his professional life , or if he realized he did n't want to spend every waking moment with his kids ? you know the answer			1
" society has this just general obsession with the dichotomy of motherhood , good versus bad , and we have this failure to see women as whole beings with motherhood only making up one aspect , " said @entity108 , editor of " @entity109 : redefining @entity120 to fit reality			1
" " instead , motherhood always gets pushed front and center and then it becomes judged , whether you are excelling or not			2
" @entity125 , a mom of twins and co-founder of a video sharing site for tweens called @entity130 , said the whole brouhaha reminds her way too much of a former first lady			1
" this sounds so much like when @entity139 said i 'm sorry i did n't stay home and make chocolate chip cookies ... and then she had to go freakin ' make chocolate chip cookies and put out chocolate chip cookie recipes , " said @entity125 , who hosted a parent blogger roundtable earlier this year at @entity135 with the mayor and his wife			0
what these stories do , women say , is make other moms feel less confident to speak out about how motherhood , for them , might not be " this cookie cutter , sugar coated version , " said @entity153 , who also hosts a blog called the @entity155			1
" how many people complain about their jobs and nobody questions their ability to do @entity160 ? " she said			0
" but yet when it comes to motherhood , where we 've placed all this pressure on parents and specifically , obviously women to turn out amazing kids , any kind of negative comment and we 're blasted			2
" there has been a trend , @entity125 said , of female bloggers and authors writing sarcastically about what a bad mother they are , almost making it " cool " to be the " griping mom			1
" but get serious and the response is not quite the same , she said			0
" if you actually admit that maybe on a real level , you think , ' oh my @entity179 , maybe i really messed up ( as a mom ) , ' that 's not ok , " said @entity125			2
" so you can be snarky and sarcastic but you ca n't be honest			0
" @entity183 , mom to a 5 - month - old , said as a new mom she totally gets what @entity13 was saying			2
" you work like crazy to get to where you are and then the most wonderful event in your life , the birth of your child , completely rips you from the world you strived to rise in			0
" " frankly , i feel sorry for women who ca n't express what @entity13 did , " said @entity183 , who is co-founder and president of @entity196 to fly , a new company connecting women and moms with job opportunities			2
" to me , that says they do n't feel comfortable talking about the lives they built before motherhood and their goals post-baby			2
furthermore , when has it been good for children to have mothers who pretend they do n't have a life beyond them ? " @entity211 , a mom of two , ages @entity210 and 3 , went back to work when her firstborn was 7 weeks old			1
she questioned her desire to work , and her desire to be home , and ultimately decided to stay home full - time and become a freelance writer , creating a blog called defining my @entity220			0
" motherhood is not all sunshine and rainbows , " said @entity211 on @entity222			1
sometimes i need time away to re-group			0
does that make me a bad mother , too ? absolutely not			2
" what do you think it will take to stop labeling women as " bad mothers " ? chime in in the comments or tell @entity239 on @entity240 or @entity241 on @entity222 .			1
