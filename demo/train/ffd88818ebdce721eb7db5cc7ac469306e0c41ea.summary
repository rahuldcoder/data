-- what do @entity1 , @entity2 , the @entity3 , @entity4 and teen vampires have in common ? calendars like this one featuring the movie " twilight " are big sellers			1
they are all subjects of hot calendars			2
be it pinned to the wall , tucked in a pocket or lounging on a desk , calendars have maintained popularity even as they face stiff competition from technology			2
while just about every cell phone or pda allows users to keep track of those ever important events and appointments , calendars still seem to hold an allure for users day by day			2
" we do not see technology - based calendars as the competition , " said @entity30 , director of marketing for @entity31 , one of the largest e-commerce sites for calendars on the @entity35			1
" they do not evoke memories of past occurrences , experiences , and pleasures			0
" a cell phone calendar also ca n't give fans the opportunity to gaze upon 12 images of their favorite celebrity or object of desire in the comfort of their own home or office			1
some of @entity31 's most popular sellers include classic movie stars like @entity56 and @entity57 as well as today 's hottest fan favorites like the cast of the movie " @entity8			1
" calendars featuring beautiful women who also happen to be celebrities are also always in demand such as those featuring " @entity67 " actress @entity66 , @entity69 's former girlfriends , known as @entity70 , and a perennial favorite -- the @entity72			1

@entity91 , one of the founders of the @entity93 , said calendars used to be must have collectors items when they were produced using the works of famous photographers and artists such as @entity99			0
calendars still have their enthusiasts , @entity91 said , especially among those who are able to tie in calendars to an already existing passion , such as collecting @entity106 memorabilia			0
" people collect different kinds of calendars , " he said			0
" there are wall calendars , desk calendars , pocket calendars , towel calendars and calendar plates			1
it 's really a very broad and interesting area			0
" and while there are a multitude of calendars that can be found -- often in a kiosk at the mall where a savvy shopper knows the prices will drop after the first of the year -- there are some that start out as collectors ' items even before they are produced			0
the @entity138 calendar , with its limited availability and artistic nude photos of some of the world 's most beautiful models , has become a sought - after item known for its exclusivity			1
@entity141 , the makers of spirits , wines and soft drinks , also produces a limited - edition calendar every year which is not for sale and has featured various starlets including @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			1
since 2000 , the company has employed world - famous and emerging photographers to capture the images , which are designed to tell a story within the calendar			1
@entity157 , head of @entity141 's communication , said the calendars are marketing works of art. " the calendar is always trying to convey seduction and passion , " @entity157 said			1
" it 's a creative way of showing what @entity141 is			2
" she said the women chosen to appear in the calendars are selected because they convey the @entity141 values			1
the calendars have become very popular in @entity172 and the @entity90 , @entity157 said , despite the fact -- or maybe because -- they are not easy to obtain			0
" [ the popularity ] is growing every year , " said @entity157 , whose company has chosen @entity177 girl @entity176 to appear in the upcoming 2010 calendar			0
