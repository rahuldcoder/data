-- @entity1 was buzzing thursday morning with news that several airlines are flying doctors and nurses to @entity6 free of charge to help with relief efforts there in the wake of tuesday 's devastating earthquake			1
the only problem : the rumors are false , an @entity14 spokesman says			1
" last night 's hoax on @entity1 about @entity18 and @entity19 flying doctors and nurses to @entity6 for free was just that -- a hoax			1
we do n't know who is responsible , but it 's a very low thing to do , " airline spokesman @entity21 said in e-mails sent thursday			0
twitter users also circulated a rumor that @entity28 would ship for free any package under 50 lbs. to @entity6			2
in a blog post wednesday on @entity28 's web site , a spokeswoman debunked the rumor and said that destruction of @entity6 's roads and communications networks " means our own shipping services to @entity6 are on hold			2
" @entity28 is donating $ 1 million to help the people of @entity6 through relief agencies , she said			1
on wednesday , @entity18 and @entity42 sent three planes to @entity44 , @entity6 's capital , carrying 30,000 pounds of water , food and other nonperishable goods for its more than 100 employees who work at the airport there and for assistance at @entity44 hospitals , the airline said in a news release			0
three more relief flights are planned from @entity55 to @entity6 on thursday , and an additional three for friday , the airline said			2
" we 've incentivized our 62 million @entity58 members to give cash to @entity60 and receive bonus miles from us , " @entity21 added			0
" we can not fly any passengers to @entity6 at this time and our efforts on the humanitarian front are as described above			2
" a spokeswoman for @entity19 said the airline is flying relief workers from agencies such as the @entity70 free of charge to @entity72 in the neighboring @entity73 , but only after they have been vetted by the @entity6 consulate			1
the consulate then arranges transportation for passengers from @entity72 to @entity44 , she said			0
" there have been a lot of people mobilizing on @entity1 asking for our support			0
and i think that 's where these rumors are coming from , " @entity19 spokeswoman @entity83 said			0
" we 're not offering free transportation for just any doctors who walk up and want to fly there			1
" the @entity14 and @entity19 rumors erupted quickly on @entity1 and other social networks , with people retweeting the @entity6 @entity74 's @entity94 phone number , which medical professionals could supposedly call for free flights			1
calls overwhelmed the consulate , resulting in repeated busy signals for callers			0
but by late thursday morning , word appeared to be spreading that the rumors were not true			0
posted one user on @entity1 about 10:30 a.m. et : " @entity14 and @entity19 are not flying doctors and nurses into @entity6 for free			1
