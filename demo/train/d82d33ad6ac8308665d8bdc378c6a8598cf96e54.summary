so ill he could not move , @entity0 supposedly sang parts of his final masterpiece , " @entity4 , " from his deathbed			2
two centuries later , the exact cause of the @entity8 composer 's premature death , in december 1791 at age 35 , is still a mystery			1
this portrait by painter @entity12 , showed @entity0 not long before his mysterious death in 1791			2
it 's known that his entire body was so swollen he could n't turn over in bed ; some say jealous rivals poisoned him , while others suggest scarlet fever , tuberculosis , or lethal trichinosis from undercooked pork			0
now , new evidence points to an altogether different conclusion : @entity0 may have died from kidney damage caused by a strep infection , possibly strep throat			1
@entity31 : ca n't stop coughing ? 8 causes of chronic cough dr. @entity34 of the @entity35 and his colleagues analyzed data from @entity39 's death registry			2
researchers had not previously analyzed the daily death registry -- begun in handwritten script in 1607 and maintained until 1920 -- for clues to @entity0 's death			1
@entity34 and his team looked at information for 5,011 adults who died during three consecutive winters starting in 1790 , as well as eyewitness accounts of @entity0 's death , according to the study published this week in @entity51			1
" by looking at the patterns of death during @entity0 's time and combining them with the signs and symptoms of his final disease , we have not one but two pillars on which our theory is built , " said @entity34			1
" although we ca n't be 100 percent conclusive , i 'm convinced that we have come very near the exact reason he died			0
" the researchers found that there were more than 500 deaths related to edema , the swelling caused by fluid in the body 's tissues			2
@entity72 was the third most common cause of death at the time , after tuberculosis and malnutrition / cachexia , a physical wasting - away that was possibly caused by cancer or diabetes			0
@entity31 : your nutrition needs in your 30s , 40s , and 50s during the winter of 1791 , there was a spike in edema - related deaths among younger men , possibly because of an epidemic of strep throat , according to @entity34			1
he and his colleagues suspect that the epidemic 's origin was the local military hospital , since crowded quarters are more conducive to the rapid spread of airborne bacteria such as group a streptococcus , which can cause strep throat			1
strep throat can progress to rheumatic fever , which can lead to heart valve and joint damage ; scarlet fever , which is characterized by a skin rash ; and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis ( @entity107 ) , a condition that causes fluid buildup throughout the body because of kidney damage			2
@entity31 : how one doctor helps patients avoid kidney problems strep bacteria 's serious side effects are why today 's experts recommend testing and prompt antibiotic treatment of strep , which causes a fiery red throat , severe pain and a high fever			2
however , most present - day throat infections are caused by viruses ( in which case antibiotics are useless ) , and they often go away without treatment or serious complications			0
dr. @entity129 , the head of the nephrology and hypertension department at the @entity133 , in @entity134 , said that the researchers might be on the right track			0
" is this plausible ? yes , " said @entity129			0
" but is it definitive ? no. " contrary to previous theories suggesting that @entity0 died in extremely rare circumstances , the new study does have a more reasonable conclusion based on what was happening in the community , @entity129 said			0
" using the most credible sources available from that period , they 're relying upon deductive reasoning			0
i 'm not sure if there 's a more scientific approach to doing this , " he added			0
even though the death registry 's data helps shed light on @entity0 's cause of death , significant gaps still leave doubt			1
many people witnessed the composer 's final days , but most of those accounts were published decades after his death			2
historians have found no written accounts by @entity0 's physicians , and have relied largely on medical reports by a doctor who was familiar with the case -- but did n't treat the composer			1
other sources used in the study include a biography written by the composer 's wife 's second husband , @entity177 , and an eyewitness account given by @entity0 's sister - in - law , @entity179 , 33 years after his death			1
dr. @entity180 , a nephrologist at the @entity181 , finds some faults with the new theory : there are no accounts of @entity0 suffering from a sore throat in the last weeks of his life ; nor were there reports of high blood pressure or blood in his urine			1
all are telltale signs of @entity107			0
@entity180 adds that @entity107 now occurs mainly in children and is nonfatal in most cases			0
@entity0 's cause of death is listed on the city 's official registry as @entity201 , or miliary fever , a condition whose symptoms include a high temperature and rash			1
@entity34 suggested this guess was made by a layperson instead of a medical authority because it was a term widely used to describe symptoms instead of an actual medical diagnosis			0
although a rash is a symptom of scarlet fever , which is also caused by strep bacteria , it 's more likely that @entity0 's death was due to strep throat , @entity34 said			1
none of the people who were with him during the last weeks of life reported that he had a rash , suggesting that he had the rash only at the time of his death			0
scarlet fever 's rash shows up the first or second day after you get sick and then subsides within six to nine days , said @entity34 , so that condition is unlikely to have been the cause of death			0
@entity31 : four things you did n't know about natural medicine what 's more , @entity0 was reported to have had a fever in the fall of 1791 , which may have been caused by the initial strep infection , the researchers say			2
some strep complications can occur weeks after the initial infection , and it 's possible that @entity0 had a sore throat before or at the time of his death and it was n't recorded			1

exact cause of @entity0 's death , at age 35 in 1791 , is still a mystery
in 1791 , edema - related deaths among younger men *increased* due to strep throat
but there are no accounts of @entity0 having sore throat in his last weeks of life
