-- @entity1 once famously quipped " i do n't care to belong to a club that would have me as a member			1
" i sort of feel the same way about online dating sites			1
there has got to be a better way to meet people			1
sadly , mental telepathy does not work			2
unless you know what i was just thinking , in which case , e-mail me			2
we flock to digital artifices that both feed and coddle our egos , says writer of online dating sites			1
i 've recently begun ... researching popular dating sites			1
not because i need a date			1
no ! i do n't need a date			1
i 'm up to my ears in hot lady action			2
no , this research is for you , for all of you			2
it 's a testament to my generosity of spirit i waded through these interweb love sewers in order to impart some sort of wisdom			2
here 's the wisdom : dating sites are terrible			1
possibly , if i was in prison , an @entity37 crab fisherman or a morbidly obese shut - in so humongous i had to wash myself with a @entity39 stapled to a broom handle , i could see the value in such sites			1
but i 'm not isolated , nor confined to a forklift			2
i do n't need a middleman brokering a get together between the potential woman of my dreams and my own abilities to self - sabotage and humiliate myself			2
i can do this without an intermediary			2
the @entity0 : have to go online to get a date ? this might or might not be a totally uninformed opinion			1
the extent of my research began and ended with me signing up for ok @entity55 , and failing to finish my profile			1
i could n't even bring myself to pick a pseudonym , which just seemed like the first of many lies required to meet anyone			2
do i call myself @entity61 and admit from the get - go that i 'm an alpha nerd ? do i overshare a little too much and pick @entity63 ? or do i just admit to being a snarky , pretentious creep and go for @entity65 ? the @entity0 : online dating dos and don'ts i tried to fill out the profile , but instead , it just filled me with a quiet rage			1
the self - summary section was baffling			0
it pushed me into an existential identity crisis			0
who am i ? or more importantly , who am i when it comes to who i want someone else to think i am , so they will contact me , go out with me , and eventually kiss me ? am i a sensitive guy , or a romantic , or sarcastic ? maybe i 'm all three			0
i love long walks , going to see live indie bands , and whatever			0
i made sure to pepper everything with winking non-sequiturs and casual attempts at pop profundity			0
then there was the section where i define myself by the books , movies , and music i listen to			0
my music list was a near impenetrable list of overly eclectic bands that reflect my excellent taste , punctuated by " and @entity96			0
" my movies were all ' 80s flicks , foreign films , and @entity100			0
by the time i got to books , and wrote " @entity103 , " i was in a full - fledged state of self - loathing			0
the @entity0 : five online dating types to avoid let me get this straight : i 'm going to spend a ton of time crafting a persona that is a borderline dishonest amplification of the personality traits i think other people will find attractive so i can find someone who 's done the same thing , and we can both go out and discover that we 're equally compatible idiots fakers			1
it 's like a masquerade party in the @entity119 : i take off my @entity121 mask just so i can reveal @entity122 from " the @entity122			0
" the @entity0 : downside of online dating there are , no doubt , many of you who have met the love of your life via online dating sites			1
congratulations on basically winning the lottery			0
i firmly believe i have a better chance of getting a girlfriend dressed like @entity134 , stopping women on the street , and bellowing , " rut with me , mortal beauty , and feel thine mighty , fleshy thunder ! " not that i want a girlfriend			1
i just broke up with six the other day			0
i can deal with the risks of love			0
the threat of heartbreak is what makes finding that one person who sparks your fuse so precious			0
but i have to be honest , the online dating thing freaked me out			1
it touched a nerve , and i 'm flummoxed as to why			0
the only conclusion i could come up with was that , maybe , we deserved them			0
perhaps online dating sites accurately reflect a generation of singles so entitled to instant happiness and acceptance , we flock to digital artifices that both feed and coddle our egos			1
virtual environments where we can indiscriminately reject dishonest projections of identity , while simultaneously being insulated from the very rejection we dole out			1
a play land of false romantic promises and deferred risk			0
a huge solipsistic waste of time			0

writer has trouble filling out his profile for an online dating service
he figures if he is borderline dishonest about his traits , his date will be too
thinks he would be better off dressing like @entity134 , bellowing on the street at women
says online dating sites draw singles who feel entitled to instant happiness
