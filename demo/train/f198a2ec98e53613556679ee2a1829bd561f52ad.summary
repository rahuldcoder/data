-- @entity1 , a @entity3 - based @entity2 executive and postgraduate student , was on her way to join @entity7 protests on november 25 when an unwelcome thought stopped her in her tracks			1
mobs in the square had sexually assaulted women protesters there a week earlier , and reports of such incidents had become common enough for her to fear a repeat occurrence			2
" a panic attack gripped me and prevented me from going because i thought no woman should go through this , " said the 29 - year - old			2
" it was almost two years since the @entity26 incident , " she said , referring to the harrowing sexual attack on the @entity22 correspondent by a mob in @entity7			1
" i did n't understand what else we needed before collective action was taken to prevent these assaults			2
i felt that it was time to step up and do something about it			0
" instead of going to @entity7 -- where , according to local reports , three women were sexually assaulted among the crowds that day -- she took to @entity37 and started an account , @entity39 , encouraging a " collective effort to promote the safety of women protesters			1
" the response , she said , was " overwhelming			0
" today @entity39 has a database of 200 volunteers , who patrol the square during mass demonstrations , recognizable in high - visibility helmets and vests , intervening to halt the attacks on women that have blighted @entity54 's revolution and its aftermath			1
in a recent mass demonstration on january 25 , for example , 25 sexual assaults were reported on women in the square			1
@entity39 intervened to rescue the victims of 10 attacks			1

the group also organizes free self - defense classes for women			1
@entity1 described @entity39 as " a story of what an individual with a computer and a @entity37 account can start , " said @entity1			1
" it gives me faith when i see these young boys and knowing they 're going to be potentially hurt to protect a woman and save her from sexual assault			2
" one of the men involved in the group is 27 - year - old petroleum company employee @entity88 , who has patrolled @entity7 on seven occasions , intervening to stop 15 assaults and being injured in the process			1
he became involved in the group after being haunted by the memory of witnessing men in the crowd assaulting a woman in the square in november			2
" it was very noisy and about 50 or 60 people were surrounding something			0
at first i thought they were catching a thief or there was a fight , " he told @entity0			0
" then someone told me ' there 's a poor girl in there '			0
" the size of the crowd made it impossible to intervene alone , he said			0
" on my own i ca n't help at all			0
if i was in a team i would be able to help her			0
" read also : the @entity118 " dictionary men " recall the day @entity115 came to town when he heard of @entity39 , he did n't hesitate to become involved			1
the group has quickly learned what works in breaking up the assaults , he said			1
when trying to help a woman escape , he said , " the most important thing is you have to get her trust			0
" " she 's in a hysterical state , standing there in cut clothes , and being harmed			0
first you have to tell her several times your name and that you 're there to protect her			0
" recounting a recent intervention by his group , he said the woman was too traumatized and disoriented by what was occurring to register the group 's presence			2
" i looked her in the eyes and said ' i 'm your only chance to get out of this crowd			0
' then i turned around and gave her my back to climb on to			0
when i felt her hands were catching , i told the crew , ' let 's move			0
' " sexual harassment is a longstanding problem in @entity54 , said @entity1			1
according to a 2008 survey of 1,010 women conducted by the @entity152 for women 's rights , 83 % of @entity152 women and 98 % of foreign women there have been sexually harassed			2
activists have developed a system to track and map incidents of harassment through mobile phones , in an effort to challenge the social acceptability of harassment			0
but @entity1 said the mob assaults of women that had been occurring during protests since the revolution , some of which have reportedly included bladed weapons , were something " entirely new			1
" read also : tackling racism in @entity63 exactly why the assaults were happening was " the billion dollar question , " she said			2
many , like @entity88 , are of the opinion that the assaults are likely premeditated and politically motivated to discredit protesters and scare off women from joining the demonstrations			1
but @entity1 said her focus was not speculating on the causes of the attacks , but stopping them			0
" we focus on the fact we have a disease we need to cure			0
" she said the group 's efforts and media attention seemed to be raising awareness of the problem and helping to change attitudes towards women			1
" it takes a long time though , " she said			0
" obviously a person who thinks this is okay , this is n't something they just decided to do today			0
" " but they definitely realize now that there are people who will stand up against what they are doing , there are people who will do everything necessary to rescue women from this horror			2
" many @entity54 were worried the assaults were casting their country in a bad light , she said			1
" but the ones behind these attacks are not the true @entity54 , " she said			1
" the true @entity152 man is the man who took off his traditional jellabeya to give it to a girl who had just been assaulted and was stripped naked			0
the true @entity54 are the men who volunteer with us and get emotionally involved in getting women out of these situations			1

@entity39 is a group dedicated to preventing assaults on women in @entity54
women have been the *targets* of mob sexual assaults during demonstrations
the group rescues women from assaults when they occur and teaches self - defense classes
