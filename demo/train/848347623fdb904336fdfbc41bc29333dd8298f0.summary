[ breaking news update 11:35 p.m. ] @entity1 has broken swimmer @entity3 's 2012 distance record in the @entity4 to @entity6 swim , putting her closer to @entity7 than anyone has ever swum without a shark cage			1
[ @entity11 story last posted at 10:18 p.m. ] @entity1 better than halfway through @entity4 - to - @entity6 swim endurance swimmer @entity1 was better than halfway across the strait separating @entity4 from the @entity15 on sunday on her fifth attempt to make it across the channel , her support team reported			1
after more than 30 hours in the water , the 64 - year - old @entity1 was more than 63 miles north of the marina where she began saturday morning			1
" this is farther than she has gone in any previous attempt , " team navigator @entity22 wrote on @entity1 's website			1
" her path is only 5 miles to the east of a straight line from @entity30 to @entity7 , thanks to a favorable @entity32			0
" @entity1 was still " swimming strongly " at just over 1.5 mph -- but averaging about 2 mph thanks to that favorable current , @entity22 wrote			2
later , her handler said that @entity1 was feeling strong and coherent			1
" she is joking for the first time all day , " wrote @entity35 on the same website			1
" the only concern is that she is throwing up everything she eats			0
she 's quite nauseous from sea salt , but that 's to be expected , " said @entity35			0
" we 're giving her enough calories and nutrition			0
we 're just going to keep feeding her , and we hope that some of it is going down			0
her stroke count has n't changed			0
" @entity1 is attempting to become the first person to swim the 103 miles without the benefits of a shark cage , flippers or wet suit			1
she 's said it will be her last attempt at that mark , after previous attempts that were thwarted by dehydration , ocean currents and excruciating jellyfish stings to her tongue			2
this time , she 's wearing a specially designed prosthetic face mask to prevent the jellyfish stings			2
" it took us a year ; we made mold after mold , " @entity1 said of the mask , adding it was the kind used to protect people who had suffered injuries to their faces			2
" it 's a two - edged sword for me			0
it 's cumbersome , it 's difficult to swim with , but it does n't matter			2
there 's no other way			0
" she jumped into the water at 8:59 a.m. saturday			0
were @entity1 to swim the 103 miles , it would validate her attempts , which have spanned 35 years			1
in 1997 , @entity80 endurance swimmer @entity79 , then 22 , completed the swim from within a shark cage			1
along with the protection the cage offers against toothy predators , swimmers say the cage provides a barrier against waves and other weather hazards			0
since @entity79 's swim , some of the world 's best endurance swimmers have tried to cross the straits of @entity6 without using a cage			1
all have been turned back , though @entity80 's @entity3 made it 80 miles in 2012 before unfavorable currents forced her to quit			0
but few have done so as persistently or as colorfully as @entity1			0
the @entity101 resident says she feels a special bond with @entity4 and hopes her repeated efforts to swim between the two countries will help improve the still - tense relations between @entity106 and @entity107			1
@entity1 is being accompanied by a 35 - member crew aboard two sail boats			1
they monitor her health , update her progress on social media and try to ward off sharks that might view her as a potential snack			0
if all goes as planned , @entity1 said , the swim will take her three days to finish .			2

@entity1 is " feeling strong *...* joking for the first time all day , " says her handler
she hopes to swim the 103 miles from @entity106 to the @entity15
it 's her fifth attempt in 35 years and will be her last , she says
if she 's *successful* , she *'ll* be the first person to do so without a shark cage , flippers or wet suit
