-- traveling in @entity2 this week , i had a chance to see the world through the eyes of the @entity6 , the @entity7 and the @entity8			0
the view from @entity10 was startlingly different than the view from @entity12 , where president @entity13 is vacationing			1
there is a consensus in @entity10 that at least 500 young @entity16 have gone to the @entity17 as jihadists			1
there is a clear belief , stated by prime minister @entity21 , that the @entity23 fighter who executed journalist @entity24 on videotape is @entity10			1
this harkens back 12 years to the beheading of another @entity29 journalist , @entity30 , and the fact that a @entity10 - @entity32 has been sentenced to death as one of the perpetrators			0
the three @entity10 newspapers devoted page after page to exploring the scale of @entity10 terrorist recruitment , the danger that the terrorists will come home , and clear warnings from the security forces that they will be overwhelmed if they come home in an organized manner			2
something profound is happening when a vicious , radical movement can recruit that many young men from a society that was housing , feeding and educating them			1
this represents a repudiation of the idea of assimilation on a scale and intensity that will lead to profound public policy changes			0
@entity21 cut short his vacation and returned to @entity62 for emergency meetings			0
he indicated quite clearly that he was prepared to expand anti-terrorist policies and make them even more aggressive			0
it is already illegal in @entity10 even to look at video such as the beheading of @entity24			0
this would clearly be unconstitutional in the @entity29 , but it indicates the seriousness with which the @entity10 take the threat of radical @entity73			1
the @entity10 have already begun suspending passports of young men who wanted to go to @entity76 or @entity77			1
they have also made it illegal to belong to @entity23			1
president @entity13 has taken a lot of grief for reading his statement about the killing of @entity24 and then going to play golf			1
at least one newspaper put a picture on its front page of the president laughing in his golf cart next to a picture of @entity24 's grieving parents			1
having now read the president 's statement and compared it to the reality of 500 - plus young @entity10 joining @entity23 , i think he may have been lucky that people were too irritated by his schedule to pay attention to his statement			1
i urge you to read president @entity13 's full text			1
it is n't very long			0
the most delusional line is his assertion that " people like this ultimately fail			0
they fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy			2
" of course it is freedom and the rule of law that have been rare throughout history , and tyranny and lawlessness that have been common			0
@entity23 and the ideology it represents wo n't just wear themselves out			2
one has to wonder whether the president understands how serious a threat @entity23 presents			1
it is a religiously motivated movement that uses terror as one of its weapons			0
beheading people is nothing new in history			0
@entity23 is much more than a terrorist organization			2
it is making money out of trading in oil and grain			0
it is making money from robbing banks and selling stolen artifacts			0
it is running a significant part of @entity76 and @entity77			0
more important than @entity23 itself is the larger movement it represents			2
it is recruiting people from many countries			0
as i have written before , from @entity144 in @entity145 to @entity146 in @entity147 to @entity23 in @entity76 and @entity77 , we are seeing the same kind of transnational religious radicalism metastasize into a deep commitment to destroy our way of life			1
as @entity154 gen. @entity153 said , this is " an apocalyptic , end - of - days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated " -- and a vision that could " fundamentally alter the face of the @entity17 and create a security environment that would certainly threaten us in many ways			2
" the @entity10 reports on the number of terrorists they are producing and the potential threat they represent should sober all of us			2
unfortunately , the @entity13 administration has no strategy for dealing with a threat of that scale .			1

@entity171 : at least 500 young *brits* have gone to the @entity17 as jihadists
@entity175 : it 's troubling that a vicious , radical group can recruit so many young men
he asks whether president @entity13 understands how serious a threat @entity23 presents
@entity175 : @entity23 may produce even more terrorists who want to destroy the @entity185
