@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has denounced a policy that called for a peaceful engagement with @entity5 as a failure			1
an annual white paper published by @entity0 's @entity8 slammed the decade - long engagement policy , which cost @entity1 $ 4.5 billion			1
the policy did not change @entity5 's " perverse " policies , the report said wednesday			1
" despite outward development over the past decade , inter-korean relations have been under criticism from the public in terms of quality and process , " the @entity14 newspaper quoted the white paper as saying			1
" they have in fact become increasingly disillusioned with the @entity25 and more worried about security as the @entity25 continued its nuclear arms program			0
" the sinking of the @entity1 warship , the @entity30 , which killed 46 sailors earlier this year , showed that the @entity25 is " ... consistently maintaining a reunification doctrine based on a strategy to turn the entire @entity35 communist despite its outward policy in favor of cooperation and reconciliation			2
" the ministry confirmed the newspaper report			0
the @entity42 is based on the @entity44 fable of a warm sun forcing a man to divest his coat after a cold wind had failed to do so			2
it lasted between 1998 and 2008			1
it overturned decades of containment , but was reversed when the conservative @entity52 took power in @entity0 in 2008			0
" this government has more focus on principle - based exchange and cooperation , " said deputy spokeswoman @entity54 of the unification ministry			0
" we want to promote peace and security through inter-korean relations -- that is the all - time goal			0
" while current relations between the two @entity67 have been cold since the @entity69 government took office , and have been icy since the naval sinking this march , there were significant tensions even at the height of " sunshine " -- including @entity5 nuclear and missile tests , and two fatal naval clashes			2
the @entity42 resulted , however , in the establishment of an enclave for @entity82 tourists in @entity5 at @entity83 and two inter-korean summits			1
the tourist enclave has been closed since 2008 when a southern tourist was shot there by a @entity88 soldier			0
today , the last tangible relic of " sunshine " is the @entity91 , a factory park just inside @entity5 where 110 @entity82 firms employ more than 40,000 @entity5 workers			2
some pundits say @entity0 's 1998 - 2008 engagement policy was undermined by fractures in the @entity5 - @entity99 alliance			1
" you had the most liberal presidents ever in @entity5 at the time of a very vigorously conservative @entity99 president who thought that accommodating the @entity5 was not the way to go , " said @entity100 , a biographer of @entity5 's leader @entity101 today @entity0 's policy aims are clear , their outcome even less so			1
" i would say that the current @entity1 policy is based on the denuclearization and the openness of @entity5 , " said dr @entity109 , of the @entity110			1
" the major critique of this policy is that it is naive			0
" although the six - party talks on @entity5 denuclearization are in limbo , @entity0 maintains some channels of communications with the @entity122			2
the unification ministry announced on thursday that the @entity1 would attend @entity125 talks with the @entity25 on humanitarian issues and on the resumption of inter-korean tourism projects			0
and " sunshine " did have some lasting benefits			0
" it did not have any concrete results , but it helped @entity1 overcome the shortcomings of their anti-communist education , " @entity100 said .			0
