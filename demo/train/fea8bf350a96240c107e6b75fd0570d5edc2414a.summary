-- @entity1 , 42 , is an eight - time marathon runner			1
he 's completed at least 10 half - marathons and lost count of the number of @entity6 he has run			1
his track record is n't bad , considering he only started running in 2007			1
that was when he finally went to the doctor			1
he knew he was overweight at 250 pounds : 100 pounds overweight , to be exact			1
but what really got his attention was when the doctor told him he had type 2 diabetes			1
type 2 diabetes is usually a byproduct of obesity ; extra fat on the body makes it hard for your system to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels at a normal level			1
it is a reversible condition			2
" it was my come - to - @entity30 moment , " the rabbi said			2
at the time , he was a father of five and knew that he had to do something or his wife would end up a widow and a single parent			2
the fear first hit @entity36 when he marked the anniversary of his father 's death			1
that year of mourning was stressful , driving him to become an emotional eater who packed an additional 30 pounds onto his already heavy frame			1
his father had been a chronically stressed smoker with type 2 diabetes , and @entity36 knew he was following in his father 's footsteps			1
yet he was in denial about it until that doctor 's appointment			2
the doctor told him that he had to lose weight and that he would have to prick himself every day to check his blood sugar			1
squeamish about blood , he knew " that was not going to happen			2
" so in june 2007 , he bought a stationary bike and started pedaling while watching episodes of the tv show " 24			1
" he started riding it for an hour a day			1
if each episode 's cliffhanger was good enough to hook him to the next episode , he 'd keep going for as long as he was watching			2
he also changed what he was eating			0
" @entity68 , i started to cut out everything bad for me , " recalled @entity36 , of @entity66 , @entity67			1
he stopped eating desserts and started eating fruits and vegetables			2
then he cut out processed sugar			0
he had dieted before but never successfully			0
this time was different : he was seeing results , so he stuck to it			0
he was still eating three meals a day but choosing his love of life over his love of food			0
@entity36 spent the summer of 2007 working in a camp			1
he walked everywhere , which allowed him to shed a noticeable amount of weight			0
" as the pounds melted away and @entity1 added a new hole to his belt to make it tighter , it was a celebration , " his wife @entity86 says			1
one morning , he told @entity86 he wanted to run a marathon			1
the very next day , he was approached by someone offering a training program for a race that was four months away			0
certain it was meant to be , he registered to run the half - marathon			2
looking back , he concedes he might have been a little delusional to think he could run a half - marathon simply because he had been riding a stationary bike and had lost a little weight			1
" when i started to run , i just had to run for one minute , and i was out of breath			2
i wondered , what did i just get myself into ? " but he forged ahead and noticed the weight was coming off faster , at a rate of about 2Â½ pounds per week			2
he signed up for a @entity105 before the half - marathon and finished			2
what 's more , he realized he liked running , not only because it helped him lose weight but because it was a stress reliever			0
" i love the freedom to be out there and think about what 's going on , what 's important for me			0
" by the time he ran that half - marathon , @entity36 had lost about 75 pounds			1
he was sleeping better , had more energy to play with his children and was more productive at work			0
almost immediately , he signed up for another one			0
then he signed up for a full marathon			1
he ran the 26.2 - mile race in january 2008			1
by may 2008 , he had reached his goal weight of 150 pounds			1
now , marathons are his love			0
running has also become a family affair ; five of his eight children have run with him at various races			0
" the message of good eating and good healthy living makes an impact on the entire family , " @entity86 says			0
" when @entity1 qualified for @entity134 ... i booked a hotel for all of us six months in advance to make sure we would be there to cheer him on			1
" @entity36 says he used to joke that he traded an eating addiction for a running addiction , but there is some truth to it			1
running used to define him			0
nothing stopped him from pounding the pavement , be it a storm outside or a storm of a different sort brewing at home			0
now , when he 's training for a race , he runs 20 to 40 miles a week and says that 's the right balance for his health and his family			0
when he 's not training , he cuts back on his mileage			0
when it comes to food , his key is planning			0
he decides what he is going to eat before he comes to the table and walks away after he has it , whether he feels full or not			2
he asks himself why he is eating , to figure out whether he is really hungry or just eating for enjoyment			0
the strategy has worked : he 's lost 100 pounds since that doctor 's appointment in 2007 and kept it off			1
he 's wearing clothes he says he never could have imagined he 'd fit into ; his waist is the size it was when he was in seventh grade			0
although the physical results are nice , @entity36 says there is also a psychological and emotional lift , too			1
he feels much more in control of his life			0
people often ask him for a magic way to melt away the pounds			2
he advises them to exercise three to four times a week and change their eating habits			0
anyone can do it , he says			0
" you have to be honest with yourself			0
if you love eating and that 's more important than losing weight , then eat			0
