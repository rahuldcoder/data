the @entity1 , capping a dramatic month of diplomacy , voted unanimously late friday to require @entity2 to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons -- or face consequences			1
" today 's resolution will ensure that the elimination of the @entity2 chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability , " @entity6 ban ki - moon said			1
the @entity1 resolution was based on a deal struck this month between the @entity14 and @entity15 that averted an @entity14 military strike over allegations the @entity2 government used sarin nerve gas in an august 21 attack on a @entity22 suburb that @entity14 officials said left at least 1,400 people dead			1
the resolution did not authorize the automatic use of force if @entity2 is said to be in violation , as was previously sought by the @entity14			2
the 15 - member @entity1 met shortly after the @entity29 , or @entity29 , voted to fast - track @entity2 's addition to the @entity31 , which bans such weapons			1
for nearly two years , the @entity1 had been unable to reach a consensus over what to do to bring about an end to @entity2 's civil war			2
@entity15 and @entity37 repeatedly vetoed resolutions dating back to october 2011 that condemned president @entity41 's government and called for him to step down			0
the turnaround came this month , when @entity15 called for @entity2 to divest itself of its chemical weapons arsenal after @entity14 president @entity44 accused @entity2 of crossing a " red line " with the use of nerve gas and threatened a strike			1
@entity2 announced this month that it was willing to join the agreement			0
a binding obligation both the @entity14 and @entity15 warned that if @entity2 failed to adhere to the terms of the @entity1 resolution , it would face consequences			1
@entity14 secretary of state @entity55 said the world community was imposing a binding obligation on the government of @entity41 to get rid of its stockpile			1
" this resolution makes clear that those responsible for this heinous act must be held accountable , " said @entity55			2
if the resolution succeeds , the world " will have eliminated one of the largest chemical weapon arsenals on @entity65 , eliminating it from one of the most volatile places on @entity65 , " @entity55 said			2
@entity15 foreign minister @entity71 told the council that his country , long an ally of the @entity2 government , " will stand ready to take action " if the resolution needs enforcement			2
by agreeing to dismantle its chemical weapons program and provide documentation of its arsenal , " @entity22 has shown its readiness to cooperate , " said @entity71			2
@entity2 @entity1 ambassador @entity84 said the resolution holds all parties in @entity2 accountable for the use of chemical weapons			1
inspectors return to @entity2 @entity1 weapons inspectors returned to @entity2 this week to look into at least a half - dozen claims of chemical weapons use -- some allegedly by the government , others allegedly by rebels			1
@entity1 inspectors have already confirmed the use of chemical warfare in the rural @entity22 suburb of @entity100 in august , but have not explicitly said who was responsible			0
the @entity41 government has repeatedly accused rebels of using chemical weapons , an assertion that has been widely dismissed by most @entity107 leaders			2
the @entity108 estimates more than 100,000 people have died since march 2011 when a brutal government crackdown against protesters devolved into an all - out civil war			0
the @entity1 vote followed action by the executive council of the @entity29 , meeting in the @entity116			0
that group adopted its measure by consensus in about 10 minutes			0
" we now have a legal mandate to start a verification mission in @entity2 , " @entity29 spokesman @entity120			0
the @entity29 agreed to an " accelerated program for achieving the complete elimination of @entity2 's chemical weapons by mid- 2014 , " it said in a statement			1
inspections in @entity2 will begin tuesday			0
" the decision also calls for ambitious milestones for destruction , which will be set by the council by 15 november , " the organization said			0
@entity44 : ' very hopeful ' @entity44 , speaking before the votes , said he was " very hopeful " about the developments , but warned much work remains to be done			0
" i think , rightly , people have been concerned about whether @entity2 will follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth and i think there are legitimate concerns as to how technically we are going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there 's still fighting going on the ground , " @entity44 said			1
@entity44 said the threat of @entity14 military power pushed @entity2 leaders to agree to destroy their chemical weapons and said the resolution " not only deters and prevents additional chemical use but actually goes beyond what could have been accomplished through any military action			1
" the @entity29 plans to send an advance team of inspectors to @entity22 , an official with the organization , who declined to be identified while discussing delicate operations , told @entity159 on friday			0
the official said that in order to meet international deadlines for destruction of @entity2 's chemical weapons , the group may opt for a " quick and dirty " program that would render the weapons unusable but would n't destroy them , the official said			1
@entity14 official : @entity2 @entity172 list more complete than anticipated ' not a license to kill ' @entity15 defense minister @entity174 has said his country is willing to transport and destroy @entity2 chemical weapons , although only as part of an international coalition			1
@entity15 president @entity179 earlier in september took to the @entity180 to argue against military intervention in @entity2			2
striking @entity2 would have many negative ramifications , @entity179 argued in the piece , including the killing of innocent people , spreading violence around the @entity187 , clouding diplomatic efforts to address @entity190 's nuclear crisis and resolve the @entity193 - @entity192 conflict and " unleash ( ing ) a new wave of terrorism			2
" in his remarks friday night , @entity197 called on both the @entity2 government and rebels to stop the fighting			0
" as we mark this important step , we must never forget that the catalog of horrors in @entity2 continues with bombs and tanks , grenades and guns , " he said			0
" a red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others			0
this is not a license to kill with conventional weapons			0
" @entity2 submits ' initial disclosure ' of chemical weapons program ' no meaningful enforcement mechanisms ' two @entity222 @entity14 senators criticized the @entity1 vote , saying it will do little to end the civil war			1
" this resolution is another triumph of hope over reality , " @entity225 and @entity226 said in a statement			0
" it contains no meaningful or immediate enforcement mechanisms , let alone a threat of the use of force for the @entity41 regime 's noncompliance			0
" the pair said @entity41 's forces will continue to " use every weapon in their arsenal short of chemical weapons " on the @entity2 people while receiving outside assistance from @entity15 , @entity190 and @entity247 while doing so .			1
