-- second seed @entity1 won his first title of 2009 after stunning world number one and clay - court king @entity5 in straight sets in front of his own fans in the final of the @entity10 on sunday			1
@entity1 acknowledges the crowd after stunning @entity5 in straight sets in the @entity10 final			1
@entity14 ace @entity1 , who had won 57 career titles but was without a tournament victory since winning on home soil in @entity18 last october , took the honors 6 - 4 6 - 4 in one hour and 26 minutes			1
the win also ended a remarkable run of success on clay for world number one @entity5 , who was unable to repeat his heroics from saturday 's epic semifinal against @entity27 when he fought back from the brink to win a gruelling battle 3 - 6 7 - 6 7 - 6 in four hours and three minutes , saving three match points along the way			1
that victory over @entity27 was @entity5 's 33rd successive win on clay stretching back over a year , while in total the @entity35 superstar had won 150 of 154 matches on dirt since 2005			2
however , the emotion of that success was clear to see on sunday and the @entity40 - born 22 - year - old was no match for his old foe , as @entity1 took the game to his opponent to beat @entity5 for only the second time in 10 meetings on clay and end his long wait for another title			2
@entity5 , despite his epic match on saturday , was quickly into his stride as he sought a sixth title this year and he created two break points on separate @entity1 service games early on			0
the @entity35 ace failed to make the most of either of those chances though , and when @entity1 's first opportunity came along in the ninth game of the first set he was not so profligate			0
@entity5 had fallen 0 - 30 behind on his serve but looked to have dug himself out of the hole , but @entity1 hit back again to take the game and moments later he was celebrating the set after holding serve to love			0
@entity5 had lost just one of 41 sets on clay this year heading into his semifinal , but he suffered a second loss against @entity27 to go 1 - 0 down in saturday 's match and found himself in an identical situation on sunday			1
he looked in determined mood in the second set though , holding his first two service games to love , but it would prove to be @entity1 who was first to break in the fifth game			0
the @entity14 ace got the chance with a superb drop shot and when @entity5 then saw his forehand shot go long , @entity1 had the break to go 3 - 2 ahead			0
@entity1 kept that advantage until the 10th game , when @entity5 , with no room for error and staring defeat in the face , had his big chance to get back on terms when he created two break points			0
however , @entity1 saved both of those and although he missed his first championship point , he clinched the title with his sixth ace of the match			0
earlier in the women 's final , world number one @entity97 clinched her second title of the year after overcoming @entity102 teen sensation @entity101			2
top seed @entity97 , following on from her success in @entity104 last week , was simply too good for ninth seed @entity101 and powered her way to a 6 - 2 6 - 4 win .			1
