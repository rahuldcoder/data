@entity0 , @entity1 -- can you do business well by doing good ? " yes , " says @entity5 , owner of @entity1 based @entity6 -- a group of more than 100 companies spanning food , technology , shipping , sports fashion , real estate and financing -- and author of the @entity1 book " @entity16			1
" " i usually say @entity16 is @entity17 on steroids , " he says			1
" we have to think in a way that unites long - term business strategy with a concern for the world we are living in			1
every action we take has a consequence			0
" although businesses have talked of @entity29 ( @entity17 ) for years , some are taking it a new level , which they are calling @entity17 3.0			1
it goes beyond the often basic image - building of traditional @entity17 and aims to create real , sustainable value for everyone , while holding the business accountable			1
@entity5 is among a small group of corporate pioneers , molding his business to make a difference -- while still making a profit			1
and , according to a number of leaders and management experts , @entity16 -- or @entity29 3.0 -- is the way of the future			0
" companies are no longer making as much money as they possibly can at any means , " says @entity45 , founding director of the @entity46 at @entity47 , @entity48			2
" it is now squarely about how companies make their money and how is it contributing to sustainability			1
" @entity5 's companies are grounded in what he calls the " four - time win " -- a goal to create value not just for the company , employees , partners and customers -- but also for the world			1
the change involves everything from running " @entity68 " and charity projects around the world , to making offices more sustainable and energy efficient , and working with governments to create change			0
as an example , @entity5 and the city of @entity76 are completing @entity82 's largest " green wall " of climbing plants in a car park in @entity76 in an effort to improve the local environment			2
ultimately , he says the change must run all the way through the value chain ; from production to processing , from suppliers to employee fulfillment in the workplace , and so on			0
" it 's a difficult change but we are making our way , " he says			0
see also : how to inspire others an innovator and leading thinker in business management , @entity5 and his team are famous for turning faltering sports label @entity99 into a global brand worn by stars like @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1

" in @entity116 , girls could be killed for playing soccer , " @entity5 says , " imagine girls playing soccer in a stadium where the @entity121 used to execute people			2
" making a difference is more than worthwhile , he says , but it should also pay off			0
" i refuse to acknowledge making money as the only thing of value , but just like a body needs blood to function , a company needs money to function , " says @entity5			1
" the question is , what does it do with the money ? we expand , but we also give back			2
companies need to gain value from making a difference , whether that is economically , socially , innovatively or from positive marketing			2
" @entity45 , who is also author of the book " @entity144 , " agrees			0
" sustainability should be treated as a business strategy that can make a profit for the company , otherwise it will not last , " she says			1
" it 's not easy stuff , but it should be seen as a need to do , not a nice to do			0
" both agree that successful @entity17 should be rooted in the core competencies of the company			1
" do it smartly and strategically with good @entity17 strategy , " says @entity45			1
" @entity157 is @entity158 handing out pink buckets of chicken with the @entity162 breast cancer foundation			0
" another key is to make change sexy , says @entity5			2
" at some point people get fed up hearing about green , so we have to think about how we can make these things cool			0
if consumers do n't think it 's cool , it wo n't work			0
social engagement has to start from the bottom up			2
" " the drive will come from enlightened leaders , " says @entity45			0
" look to companies like @entity183 and @entity184 's who are really doing it , " she says , noting the world 's largest retailer , @entity177 , as another frontrunner credited with making significant changes to its supply chain			1
outdoor - clothing company @entity183 's new @entity187 works with customers to repair , re-use , re-sell and recycle used @entity183 products			1
over the past 20 years , the company says it has given more than $ 40 million to environmental causes and pioneered the use of organic cotton and fleece from recycled soda bottles			2
" we are only scratching at the heels of guys like @entity183 , " @entity5 says , " but this kind of change is an ongoing process			1
" to him , @entity16 is also an important consideration in attracting the talent of tomorrow			0
" the new y generation wants to be proud of the product and the company they work for , " he says			0
" they have turned @entity210 's pyramid of needs around and see self - realization as the most important thing			0
" in addition to that , @entity5 says the disappearance of traditional value and identity streams like family , rituals , tradition , and religion , is creating an opportunity for companies			1
" all those things are losing influence , and we can provide some of that value and identity to our employees			0
" so , what does the future of @entity16 or @entity17 look like ? young people are already there , says @entity5			1
" a few days ago , i was a judge at @entity238 's social entrepreneurship competition , ' @entity239 , ' and the innovative ideas young people have on social entrepreneurship and sustainability are amazing			2
