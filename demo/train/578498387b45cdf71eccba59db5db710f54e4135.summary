-- @entity1 was always a fighter			1
but in a message to a friend in the waning days of her life , she seemed exhausted			0
the note , written at a time of spiritual darkness , suggested defeat after a decades - long struggle for medical coverage			2
" i honestly do n't know how much more i can endure , " @entity12 wrote earlier this year in a @entity14 message to her friend @entity15			1
" i am fighting for ( @entity17 ) and disability			1
i ca n't work i sit in bed i cry a lot			2
i am still fighting for healthcare and still fighting foreclosure			2
" i am so upset but perhaps it was not meant to be			0
i do n't know anything anymore , " said @entity12 , who died in july at age 63 without insurance coverage			1
as she typed the note , @entity12 could scarcely breathe			2
her lungs had filled with fluid over several months ; her respiratory system was shutting down			0
after visits to the emergency room and several free clinics , @entity12 was finally diagnosed with @entity36 's lymphoma			1
but what makes her family bristle : @entity12 did not have to die			1
if she had had health care , " absolutely she 'd still be here , " said @entity41 , @entity1 's daughter , adding that @entity36 's lymphoma has a high survival rate			1
" that is something really hard to deal with			0
" " i know she felt scared because there were no options			0
why do something ( about illnesses ) when you know you ca n't get proper care to fix it ? " except there were options			2
the @entity57 , which takes full effect in 2014 , was supposed to save people like @entity12 ( with pre-existing conditions and no medical coverage ) in the interim by way of high - risk pools , also known as the @entity65 or @entity66			1
the pools are supposed to be a safety net , but many , like @entity12 , are falling through the cracks			2
@entity12 's family spent her final months fighting for @entity17 , with no clue that they qualified for @entity75 's high - risk pool			1
they are not alone : of the estimated 200,000 - 375,000 people expected to enroll in @entity66 in the first year , less than one - third have done it , according to the @entity79			0
@entity1 's husband , @entity12 , admitted that he did not know many details of the program , and much of the conversation about health care has been confusing			1
" i was under the impression that pre-existing ( @entity66 ) did n't start until 2014 , " said @entity12 in a recent interview with @entity0			1
since this act was passed , to us , people with pre-existing , we were hoping and searching for some sort of way to get health care			1
the way it has divided the country , some states suing to try and stop it , it 's just confused everybody			0
" @entity15 , a nurse who met @entity1 in her role as a health care advocate and spokeswoman for the group @entity104 , fears the @entity106 ' story will be echoed repeatedly , even with @entity57 's passage			1
" in a humane health care system , as much of the rest of the world has , no one would have to know the arcane minutiae of how to apply for a high risk pool , " said @entity15			1
" everyone would have ( coverage ) that qualifies you for health care when and where you need it			1
" that sort of access is promised to many through the @entity57 , but stories like the @entity106 ' suggest the act -- at least as it relates to high - risk pools -- still has some kinks			0
in the midst of the family 's confusion , @entity12 was unwittingly suffering from cancer again -- her fourth diagnosis			1
during a 2009 interview with @entity0 she quipped , " i do n't get a cold , i get cancer , and cancer , and cancer			0
" that terrifying litany of cancer diagnoses began in 1988 with a bulging tumor found in her right breast			0
thirteen years later , the same diagnosis , this time in her left breast			0
and in 2005 , it was kidney cancer			0
the doctor 's grim pronouncement , according to @entity12 : " ' your right kidney ... it 's breaking apart			1
you have a tumor ... and you also have a tumor in your left kidney			0
' " crush of cancer , medical bills snares family by then , the @entity106 had been on a roller coaster , going from what they describe as the best medical coverage to having none			2
in between came skyrocketing insurance premiums , high deductibles , and stacks of unpaid medical bills following each cancer diagnosis			0
at a certain point , feeling like her pre-existing conditions were to blame for her soaring and unaffordable insurance rates , @entity12 gave up on coverage			2
her insurance company @entity174 later said @entity12 's previous cancer diagnoses were not the culprit for the rate increases			1
although the company did not cite a specific reason for the increased rate , @entity179 , an @entity174 spokeswoman said : " there can be other contributing factors to rate increases for small business policies , including , for example , the aggregate cost of the entire pool of small business policies in the state			0
" during the interview with @entity0 three years ago , @entity12 admitted to volleying between fear of the unknown and acceptance of her fate , even though without insurance , she had no idea whether she had cancer again			2
but telling her story enlivened her , according to friends			0
" when she was interviewed for @entity0 originally , it was one of the most hopeful periods of her years - long struggle , " said @entity203 , @entity12 's friend , an advocate and community organizer with @entity104			1
" most recently , as her health grew even worse and she faced the loss of her home and the final parts of her savings , @entity1 just yearned for dignity and some sort of peace that never seemed to come			1
" and nearly three years later , as her death approached , the pendulum had swung decidedly toward fear			0
" and me , ms. healthcare @entity0 interview tough person now a scared little girl who after beating cancer 4x now sits in bed with oxygen and breathing treatments , " @entity12 wrote to @entity15			2
" i was always able to stand up to whatever hit me			0
i 'm not so sure about things anymore and maybe not so tough			0
" to see if you qualify for @entity66 , or to apply , visit @entity230 .			0
