-- when i think about the importance of voting , i think about kids and what kind of opportunities they are going to have in life			2
i 've been lucky enough to have incredible opportunities that allowed me to lead a wonderful , successful life even prior to my fortunate career in the entertainment business			0
the @entity12 allowed me to work by the age of 12 , helping me develop a strong work ethic			2
without government financial aid i would have never been able to attend college and along the way , bump into @entity18 , who offered me my very first role in " @entity20			0
" being an actress , i 've had the opportunity to work with poor students , helping to provide arts - intergrated education programs for the past 19 years , working with many young students in @entity27 , the @entity28 , @entity29 and the @entity30 of @entity31			1
i am inspired to support young people who want a future in the arts and in jobs that will make their communities better			1
i found that these students have incredible dreams for their future			1
but their dreams could be shattered if we elect the wrong candidates -- people who will pursue policies that do nothing for kids			1
the young people i work with come from underprivileged backgrounds			1
they want to achieve the @entity49			0
and the @entity49 is about providing opportunities for all -- rich and poor			0
many of them are the children of immigrants who brought them here when they were little , some documented and some not			2
until recently , these students had to live in constant fear of being deported to another country , even though @entity58 is where they grew up and is the only home they have ever known			2
some of that fear was lifted when president @entity62 announced earlier this year that the government will not deport young people who were brought here as children and are currently in school , have graduated from high school or obtained a ged , or have been honorably discharged from the armed forces			1
here 's why voting matters			2
after the new policy was announced , @entity71 's senior adviser , @entity70 , said to @entity0 that if the @entity75 nominee is elected , this new policy will be " subject to review and repeal			1
" that statement brought tears to my eyes			0
i thought about an applicant to our organization 's scholarship program -- a straight - a student whose sole dream is to become a lawyer			2
she was accepted to multiple @entity90 colleges but could not apply because she was not able to qualify for funding as an undocumented young person			2
she is thinking of going to @entity93 because it is the only place she can barely afford $ 6,000 a year			0
but this could still fall through without financial assistance			0
she would be forced to choose between housing and food , or a degree in law			0
even if she does attend college , she will be jeopardizing her stay in the @entity58 as an undocumented person once she enrolls because she has no idea if the policy will remain intact or be rescinded			2
she is as @entity58 as anyone else , but her parents immigrated here when she was very young			0
she is now terrified that the new policy will be repealed			0
she is afraid of being deported			0
but what terrified her even more , she said , was that she may never become a lawyer			0
it 's especially important for people who care about kids and education to vote , because too many of our political leaders are just out of touch with these everyday realities			1
@entity71 recently suggested -- at a private dinner for wealthy donors who each paid $ 50,000 to be there -- that it would be easier for him to be elected president if he were @entity124			1
as if his privileged background as the son of a millionaire corporate ceo who sent him to @entity128 and @entity129 was some kind of disadvantage in life			0
" my dad , as you probably know , was the governor of @entity135 and was the head of a car company , " @entity71 said			1
" but he was born in @entity138 , and had he been born of @entity138 parents , i 'd have a better shot at winning this ... but he was unfortunately born to @entity58 living in @entity138 ... i say that jokingly , but it would be helpful to be @entity124			0
" maybe @entity71 thinks it 's " easier " because he thinks we 're all living off of government handouts , or because @entity146 won the election on " @entity148 , " or because he 's a cynical leader who thinks that optics matter more than policies			1
but we 're not fooled that easily			0
watch : @entity152 's video response to @entity71 's comments @entity71 also said that he is not concerned about " 47 % " of @entity58			1
as we take in the devastation of @entity155 , we have to ask : what if it happens again and @entity71 is elected ? what will the " 47 % " do if they have to deal with a major disaster without @entity161 , without government help ? when i heard what @entity71 said , i realized that i needed to do more to encourage every citizen to vote in this election			1
i 'm going to vote because i want elected officials who understand and can relate to the obstacles that young people and their parents face every day			1
i 'm going to vote because it hurts all of us when at least 11 million hardworking people in this country are vulnerable to exploitation by their employers simply because our government denies them a path to citizenship			1
most of all , i 'm going to vote because i believe in an @entity58 that provides liberty and justice for all , and i want every child to have the opportunity to pursue the @entity49			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			1

@entity152 : young people 's dreams can be shattered if we elect the wrong politicians
@entity192 : @entity62 said that he wo *n't* deport young immigrants who may be *illegal*
she says @entity71 may repeal policy , which would affect students who work hard
@entity192 : it 's especially important for people who care about kids and education to vote
