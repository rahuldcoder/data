@entity1 even a zombie apocalypse has a silver lining			1
fans of the wildly popular @entity7 series " @entity8 " are making their way to @entity1 and surrounding small - town @entity4 to sniff out traces of @entity13 ' crew of survivors and the voracious zombies on their trail			1
on one recent sunday , two " @entity18 " bus tours drew mostly out - of - state visitors with fans from @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and places across the @entity26 , plus a fan from @entity28 on a monthlong @entity30 odyssey			1
many planned their trips especially to see " @entity8 " locations up close			1
@entity34 and her husband , @entity35 , flew into @entity1 from @entity36 for a zombie - centered getaway			1
the couple have been fans of the show , now in its fifth season , since @entity43 and have attended @entity44 in @entity45 more than once to meet the cast			2
" everybody 's always like , ' what if , what if something happens ? i do n't know what i would do			0
' well , the show kind of shows you what people would do , " said @entity34 , 48 , while waiting to start her second zombie tour of the weekend			0
" everybody can relate to somebody on this show			0
" identifying with the lurching , rasping " walkers " is a taller order , but guides on the " @entity18 " tours help			1
they 've worked as zombie extras on the show			0
tour guide @entity67 , 42 , has appeared as both zombie and human since he attended " @entity71 " ( auditions ) right before season two , but he 's still waiting for a shot at prosthetic facial gashes and deformities and the painful , vision - obscuring contact lenses worn by " featured hero zombies			2
" " ' featured zombie ' is the term they use for the zombies that have all the prosthetics and the camera is right up on them , and they usually have some interaction with the cast or they 're gnawing on somebody , " @entity67 said			0
big business flesh - eating walkers are far from the only @entity94 types roaming @entity4			1
a 2008 tax credit of up to 30 % for productions of $ 500,000 or more has spawned hordes of film crews			1
" @entity99 : catching @entity100 " and the franchise 's third installment , the two - part " @entity104 " sequel , were all filmed in and around @entity1			1
more than 150 film and tv productions were shot in @entity4 in fiscal year 2014 alone , according to the @entity4 film office			1
last year , the state launched @entity109 , aimed at entertainment fans			1
since 2010 , about a dozen film and television studios have announced plans to locate or expand in @entity4			1
@entity115 - based @entity114 recently opened a new facility , where @entity123 's " @entity122 " has started filming , and @entity1 mogul @entity117 is hoping to develop studio space at the shuttered @entity120 base @entity121			2
the rush of movie and tv projects builds on a longstanding state interest in the benefits of film production , a focus sparked by the 1972 film " deliverance			2
" but fans of present - day hits are more likely to recognize the wilds of post-apocalyptic @entity1 and " @entity8 's " fictional @entity136 than the whitewater rapids of northeast @entity4			1
the " @entity18 " tours ( $ 65 ) are operated by @entity139 , which launched in 2012 with a single " @entity8 " - themed tour			1
the company now hosts two zombie tours and two other film - related tours and recently welcomed guest no. 10,000			2
so far , almost all of the company 's business is zombie - related , according to co-owner @entity150			0
tv and movie clips are played on the tour bus for film - to - real - life comparisons			2
the company is headquartered in a historic and recently revitalized downtown warehouse district called @entity157			0
the neighborhood is an easy walk from @entity160 and within blocks of much of the @entity1 - based action in season one of " @entity8			1
" just down the street from the tour office is the @entity166 , where @entity13 ( @entity167 ) rode on horseback over a tangle of railroad tracks to seek refuge in @entity1 in the first season			2
directly across the bridge is the unoccupied @entity173 , which was the scene of much rooftop debate and some hand - wrenching decision - making after @entity13 arrived on the scene			2
the famous tank scene was filmed a few blocks north , near the corner of @entity180 and @entity182 streets			0
season one 's downtown scenery is easily walkable for visitors just looking for a taste , but a bus tour is a convenient option when fans start looking to sites south , west and north of downtown			2
by bus , visitors can see the recent @entity194 ( near the corner of @entity196 and @entity198 streets ) , the hospital where @entity13 wakes up to the apocalypse ( @entity202 offices on @entity203 ) and the @entity204 stand - in ( @entity206 )			0
for do - it - yourselfers , your own wheels , a gps and a good combing of the internet for location addresses are essential			0
points south and star sightings " @entity8 " action moved out of @entity1 to rural settings in season two			1
the second installment of the " @entity18 " tours starts about 35 miles south of @entity1 in @entity221 , the show 's fictional @entity136			1
the quaint little town is doing big zombie business			0
check - in for tours is centered at the @entity227 , a recently relocated and expanded " @entity8 " emporium packed with t - shirts , messenger bags , calendars , belts and more			1
flattened penny souvenirs saying " i ( heart ) @entity238 " sell for four quarters ( plus the penny )			0
location guides for seasons one through four are available for $ 25 , or visitors can book more pinpointed @entity242 at the shop for about $ 15			0
the @entity244 just opened on the lower level adjacent to a display of prison cells and other props from the show			0
the second " @entity18 " tour takes visitors to a handful of @entity254 locations , including the @entity255 ( @entity256 facility in @entity257 ) , the sleepy town of @entity258 , where season three 's " @entity260 " episode was shot , and to the barn and abandoned feed mill in @entity263 , where @entity13 meets the governor for the first time and later , where @entity266 and the governor face off			1
sadly for fans , the farmhouse that stars in season two is off - limits			0
its occupants apparently regret their house 's role in the show and do not welcome visitors			0
the prison is also missing from the tour , as it was built at @entity280 and has since been dismantled			0
still , lucky fans might see more than " @entity8 " sets			1
before the recent tour , some fans spotted @entity285 ( @entity286 ) at the new coffee shop in the @entity227			0
filming is scheduled to go on right outside @entity221 's town center until mid-november			0
and back in @entity1 , there 's at least one classic institution that boasts more than its fair share of celebrity sightings			2
@entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 have all been spotted at the gritty yet beloved @entity303			0
" @entity8 " character @entity304 , played by @entity305 , recommended the @entity303 to @entity306 during a 2013 appearance on his show , describing it as a " really fun , divey place " with " an open stripping area " with " mostly older , beautiful ladies			2
" while you 're in town , live a little .			0
