@entity0 -- the day after little @entity4 's mangled body was found in a suburban @entity0 trash compactor , @entity2 sat in a stark room for a police interview			1
he began with confidence , but ended with trouble			2
@entity10 , a special agent with the @entity11 , hooked up the jeans - clad @entity2 to a polygraph machine			1
then , he fired off a series of questions to the 20 - year - old maintenance man			2
a videotape of @entity2 's polygraph test was released thursday			1
" regarding that girl , do you intend to answer these questions truthfully ? " " yes			1
" " did you participate in any way in causing the death of that girl ? " " no. " " did you cause the death of that girl ? " " no. " " do you know for sure who caused the death of that girl ? " " no. " @entity10 asked the questions three times			1
each time , @entity2 said he had nothing to do with @entity32 ' killing			1
by the end of the interview , @entity10 knew better			2
@entity2 had turned into a prime suspect			1
in the videotape , he tells @entity37 that he did poorly on the questions regarding his alleged participation in @entity41 ' death and the disposal of her body			2
" i can see you 're not doing good on this test , " @entity10 says			2
" those two questions are really bothering me			2
" " i 'm not holding back , " @entity2 says			1
i 'll take the test again			0
" but that was not an option for @entity2			1
the next day , on december 7 , he was arrested			0
eventually , he pleaded guilty and , standing before a judge in a @entity53 courthouse , he described in detail how he enticed , molested and killed @entity41 , 7 , in @entity55 , 40 miles north of @entity0			1
after he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole , @entity2 hanged himself with his sweathshirt in a prison cell			1
it was that polygraph test that was started @entity2 's unraveling			1
" i 've been doing this for a long time , " @entity10 tells @entity2 at the start of the session			1
but @entity2 seems not at all concerned about the questions he is about to face			1
some people think they can beat a polygraph test , said dr. @entity70 , a forensic psychiatrist at @entity71 in @entity0			0
" the fact is that most of them ca n't do it , " he said			0
" you can control how you look			0
you ca n't control how you sweat			0
" besides , said @entity70 , criminals are not known for good judgment			0
his shirt sleeve rolled up to his shoulders , @entity2 begins by telling @entity10 that on a scale of one to 10 , he is a 7.5 on the truth meter			1
that he had lied the day before when police asked him whether he 'd run the trash compactor at the @entity84 in @entity55 , where @entity32 's body was found			0
" i should have just told the truth straight up , " @entity2 says			1
" but i did n't			0
" @entity2 tells @entity87 that his family was originally from @entity89 but he had been living in @entity90 , @entity91			1
he moved to the @entity55 complex in november , where he was living at a discount and working in maintenance			0
he 'd finished 10th grade but no more			0
@entity10 tells him it 's never too late to graduate			2
@entity2 went to @entity98 a few years back on a church mission to help rebuild houses for the needy			1
@entity102 asks him if he smoked marijuana			0
@entity2 admits to smoking the night before			1
he answers @entity10 's questions with apparent ease , not as a man who had committed a heinous crime			2
later in court , he would describe how he used a roller skate to lure @entity41 into a vacant apartment			2
he told the judge he made the girl undress and wanted to take her for " sexual purposes			2
" he said he got scared that she would go home and tell her parents what had happened			0
so he struck her with the skate , slit her throat and tossed her body into the compactor			0
he even taped a handwritten note telling investigators that @entity41 was in there , almost as though he wanted his crime to be discovered			0
by the end of the polygraph test , @entity2 's voice is slight			1
he appears more nervous and goes outside to smoke a cigarette			0
when he returns , @entity87 confronts him about his lies			2
" there 's something on this that you 're not telling us			0
something that you are keeping to yourself , " he says			0
" what is it you 're holding back ? because we 're trying to solve this thing			0
" @entity2 fiddles with his cell phone			1
@entity10 tells him not to worry about his calls , that he 's got more important things to worry about			2
" it 's just written all over you			0
" " i am not bothered at all			0
" " you have n't told the complete truth about everything			0
" it turns out @entity2 lied about smoking pot , as well			1
he had smoked that morning , not the night before , as he said previously			0
@entity10 tells him that he is concerned about @entity2 's marijuana habit			1
@entity2 says he gets high but " it does n't make me crazy			1
" before the video cuts off , @entity10 asks @entity2 about allegations he faced in @entity157 before his move to @entity91			1
he had been accused of sexually fondling another girl			2
" you know what i 'm talking about , " @entity10 says			0
" i do n't , " @entity2 replies			1
" remember i said you had to be 100 % truthful ? i asked you if anyone made accusations			0
so what you done is told me a lie			0
you also lied about the trash compactor			0
" " they put things in that child 's head , " @entity2 says			1
" i 'm a good person			0
i did n't do nothing to that little @entity174 girl and i did n't do nothing to ( the other ) girl			2
" there is little remorse in @entity2 's words			1
later in court , he would tell @entity41 ' family that he was sorry			2
" @entity182 , " he said in @entity174			0
but in front on @entity41 ' sobbing mother , @entity2 's apology fell far short			1
two days later , he , too , was dead .			0
