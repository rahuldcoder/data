-- " the @entity2 media created an icon , an almost perfect human being			1
" - soccer agent @entity5			2
above all else , @entity6 just needs to feel loved again			1
it has been in short supply during the final , painful throes of his tempestuous tenure as coach of @entity12			1
beaten to the @entity15 title by @entity16 , blasted out of the @entity17 by @entity18 and battered by the press in @entity12 , this is a season he 's decried as the worst of his career			1
the 50 - year - old leaves looking visibly drained , with dissent dripping from the dressing room and insults ringing in his ears , rivals lamenting him as a " scourge " on @entity26 football			1
little wonder then that @entity6 has opted for a return to @entity35 , the @entity2 side that helped the @entity36 etch his name into the fabric of modern football folklore as " @entity6			1
" for a man who seems determined to forge new frontiers and embrace different cultures around the continent his desire for a second stint at @entity43 has come as a surprise to many			0
but according to @entity36 journalist @entity50 , @entity6 's latest move is down to the concept of pater familias ; having reached a stage in his career where he wants to mold a club in his image for the long term			1
" i think he is ready to come back to @entity35 in a different way , to try and build something from zero , " @entity50 , a reporter at the @entity58 newspaper , told @entity0			1
" it will be a challenge to rebuild @entity35 's team			1
this might be the job that keeps him there for five or 10 years			2
he needs to be the number one guy in the club , not only winning but thinking about the club , changing it , preparing it			0
" when @entity6 was starting his career he wanted to win things -- leagues , cups and the @entity17 -- but now he has achieved this status in his career where he needs more			1
" i see this might be a great chance for him to finally have a real connection with ( @entity35 's billionaire @entity84 owner @entity83 ) in the way that they can build a @entity35 to look like @entity88 did under @entity89			1
" @entity50 agrees that @entity6 's time at @entity12 will have chastened the coach who famously anointed himself as " special			1
" three years in @entity26 have brought a hat - trick of domestic trophies , including a league title that broke @entity16 's dominance under @entity96 , but , crucially , not the 10th @entity17 crown their fervent fans crave			1
growls of disquiet had been audible for a while but as soon as @entity12 's quest for " @entity103 " ended , it became a crescendo			1
@entity6 spoke of the people in @entity26 who " hated " him and confirmation of his departure led @entity16 vice-president @entity108 to declare him a " scourge on @entity26 football " in a radio interview			1
@entity108 also predicted he 'll be a " disaster " at @entity35			2
dressing room dissent unusually for a coach who has prided himself on forging unbreakable spirit amongst his squad , criticism has also seeped from his players			2
the coach 's decision to drop goalkeeper @entity121 , @entity26 's @entity122 - winning captain and a @entity12 poster boy with 23 years ' service to the club , in favor of new signing @entity127 caused much of the consternation			1
his own players , including fellow @entity36 @entity131 , criticized his treatment of @entity121 but @entity6 would not yield , dismissing the defender 's remarks as jealousy			1
despite this fractious finale to his real career , one of @entity6 's former players has a different take on the culture of conflict that has dominated the final chapter of his @entity145 reign			1
" at @entity12 some players were against him but you have to look at that in a different way : why , in a 12 - year career , is it that only two or three people are complaining ? " asks @entity146 , known as @entity147 , who played under @entity6 for @entity36 side @entity148			1
" for me this is success , this is huge			0
everywhere he goes people like him ; he passed through so many clubs , so many players , so many figures and only now some people complain			2
" even as a young coach @entity6 was laying the founding principles upon which his success would be based			1
his first step is demonstrating , and demanding , ultimate loyalty from his charges			0
so what was it like to play for him ? " he protected us from everyone , from the president , from fans , from journalists			0
to protect his own people he does n't care about the consequences outside , " @entity147 explained			0
" even when he left @entity179 , one player that hardly played ( @entity182 defender @entity181 ) hugged him and cried with him , so this revealed what he does inside a team			0
" he makes you believe you are the best player			0
in my case , a player who was 20 years old , he told me i would be the best player in the league			2
even though i was n't , i believed him			0
this is like a father to a son , your son is always the best			0
this is his major weapon			0
" he 's also good with personal relationships -- he is like a psychologist			2
he has a lot of qualities that are not normal in coaches			0
" i believe he is the same person but when you are coach of @entity35 or @entity12 you have more enemies , let 's say			1
it is a more difficult fight when you are in a big team , but he will protect everyone until the end			0
" press relations @entity6 's entrance at @entity35 back in 2004 was unforgettable			1
@entity212 and sophisticated , he strolled into his new post as a @entity17 winner with @entity215 and instantly declared to the gathered media : " i think i am a special one			0
" this one line came to symbolize his close relationship with the @entity2 press			2
they loved his perceived arrogance , the way he prowled the touchline , and he admired their principles of fair play			0
though that relationship had soured by the time he left @entity35 in 2007 , having secured five major trophies -- including the club 's first league title in 55 year -- it still represented the high point in his dealings with the media			1
his time as coach of @entity179 in @entity182 , which yielded two @entity238 titles , two domestic cup wins and another @entity17 triumph , was punctuated by rows with journalists -- one even accused him of physical violence			2
relations with the notorious @entity12 press veered between difficult and impossible ; @entity6 's desire to shape the club the way he wanted combined with his confrontational style jarred with many			1
" he always understood something that is awfully important in modern football , to play a role , as if in the theater , " @entity50 explains			2
" if you go to the theater you see an actor performing a role and he does that			0
i think he does that sometimes in a positive way , sometimes in a way people do n't understand			0
the press in @entity12 never understood this			2
" the press are all supporters of the club			0
it 's a personal thing in @entity26 , when they see someone who is trying to change the situation at the club			0
" he tried to change the organization ; he had problems with ( former @entity12 director ) @entity277 , trying to have full control of the professional team			2
this was not regarded as a positive thing by the press or the players			0
" there was no way out for him , even if he had won the @entity17			0
if he had won ' @entity103 ' then he could have gone out using the main door leaving like a @entity288 , but he did n't			0
" @entity147 's playing career is nearing an end but he already has his " @entity292 coaching license as he looks to follow in @entity6 's footsteps			1
he says his old coach 's methods will form the basis upon which he approaches his role			1
" as @entity6 said , we always can improve the individual , " he explained			2
" we do n't have to take the best players to have the best team , we can put a couple of guys together and make them the best together			0
i saw this with my eyes so i want to do it for the kids back in my home country @entity309			0
" i learnt from @entity6 that everyone should be treated differently			2
you would n't treat @entity312 the same like @entity313			0
a guy that is more explosive i try to extract his quality , a guy that is more technical too , we do n't need to criticize			0
" we were in one team that was simple and we were fighting to be champions with a low budget , inferior players , but as a unit it worked , i saw it with my eyes			0
we can inject psychology and knowledge into any individual			0
" @entity6 is almost complete as a coach			1
in @entity2 he is known as ' @entity6 ' but when you know him , you see that it 's not a joke			1

@entity6 is returning to coach @entity35 six years after leaving @entity335
the @entity36 coach 's three - year tenure at @entity12 ended in *failure*
@entity6 ready to build a *dynasty* at @entity35 , according to a @entity36 journalist
