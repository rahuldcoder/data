@entity0 -- standing before throngs of cheering supporters sunday , @entity3 president @entity2 called for an end to the division among @entity8 in the wake of the @entity10 upgrading the authority 's status -- as @entity13 refused to acknowledge that newfound recognition			1
" the people who have achieved the accomplishment of the 29th of november , when the world wrote the birth certificate of the state of @entity22 , are capable of imposing the will of the people in making the reconciliation happen , " he said at a packed rally in @entity16			2
the @entity26 on thursday elevated the authority 's status from " non-member observer entity " to " non-member observer state " -- the same category as the @entity31			0
@entity3 leaders had previously launched a failed bid for full @entity10 membership			1
@entity2 is a part of the @entity3 faction @entity36 , which controls the @entity37			1
@entity38 is controlled by @entity39 , which has battled @entity36 for power and -- until last week -- long opposed its efforts to achieve the status upgrade			0
@entity2 , speaking sunday , said there are " a lot of missions " ahead , and the " most important is to restore our national unity and achieve reconciliation			1
" @entity13 and the @entity49 have slammed the authority 's move at the @entity10 , with @entity49 secretary of state @entity52 said friday it was " a step that will not bring us closer to peace			1
" and , in response to the @entity10 move , @entity13 prime minister @entity56 refused sunday to reconsider a plan to build thousands of new homes in occupied territory			1
the @entity49 and a number of @entity64 nations called on @entity13 to roll back the settlement plan in the @entity37 and @entity0 , which was announced friday			2
@entity66 : new @entity13 settlements a ' set back ' for peace with @entity8 @entity13 settlements are widely considered illegal under international law , though @entity13 insists they are not			1
" the answer to the attack on the @entity79 character of the state of @entity13 obliges us to increase the tempo of settlement building plans in all the areas that the government has decided to settle in , " @entity56 said in remarks before the start of his weekly @entity75 meeting in @entity0			2
he said he was citing " the language of the government decision in 1975 after the @entity10 decision that equated @entity89 with racism			1
" @entity56 has called the @entity3 's @entity10 bid " a gross violation " of an agreement signed with the @entity13 government			1
@entity13 says it violates a @entity3 agreement to work out central issues through negotiation			1
@entity56 has not publicly acknowledged the approval of new construction			0
but a senior government official said saturday that the prime minister signed off on building " 3,000 housing units " in the @entity0 as well as authorizing planning and zoning for future construction in the @entity37 town of @entity106			2
the @entity109 administration has repeatedly warned @entity13 against settling @entity0 and the @entity37 , particularly the @entity106 area , because it would make it nearly impossible to create a contiguous @entity3 state			1
the @entity13 cabinet , in a unanimous vote sunday , rejected the @entity26 's decision , saying it changes nothing and will not be a basis for negotiations			2
the creation of a @entity3 state will require " arrangements that ensure the security of the citizens of @entity13 , recognition of @entity13 as a jewish state , and a declaration by @entity8 that the conflict is over , " the @entity75 statement			2
@entity13 seized the @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity128 and @entity129 during the 1967 war			0

@entity13 withdrew settlers from @entity38 in 2005			0
@entity39 has since regularly launched rocket attacks into southern @entity13			0
the @entity3 bid to the @entity10 and news of @entity13 settlement construction came just days after a cease - fire took hold between @entity13 and @entity39 that brought about an end to a series of @entity13 military airstrikes against @entity38 launched in an effort to stop the @entity39 rocket attacks			1
@entity147 , a militant group and political party in @entity149 , has launched attacks on @entity13 from the north			0
both @entity147 and @entity39 receive support from @entity153			0

the @entity158 , the @entity49 , and @entity13 consider @entity39 a terrorist organization			0
the @entity49 and @entity13 also consider @entity147 a terrorist group			0
the @entity3 's new @entity10 status allows it to have cases heard before the @entity163 -- a concern for @entity13 as @entity8 have repeatedly tried to have their claims heard before the judicial body at the @entity167			1
international efforts for a " two - state solution " focus on a plan to unite @entity38 and @entity37 under the authority of a single @entity3 government			2
