-- @entity2 is blocking access to @entity4 in response to an online group calling on people to draw the @entity8 , officials said wednesday			1
the @entity9 issued the order a day before " @entity11 , " scheduled by a @entity4 group with the same name			1
" obviously ( the blocking of @entity4 ) is related to the objectionable material that was placed on @entity4			2
that is why it is blocked , " said @entity16 of the telecommunication authority			2
" we have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time			0
we are just following the government 's instructions and the ruling of the @entity27			0
if the government decides to unblock it , then that 's what we will do , " he said			0
the organization has not received any complaints from internet users about the blocking of @entity4 , he said			2
@entity37 @entity36 consider it offensive to depict @entity8			1
there were riots around the world in response to a series of cartoons of @entity8 in a @entity46 newspaper in 2005 , and at least two @entity48 cartoonists live under police protection after publication of their drawings of the @entity53 prophet			1
@entity54 , who started the @entity4 group , said she read about the idea on a blog after @entity58 bleeped out part of an episode of " @entity61 " that mentioned the prophet			1
" this is meant to be in protest , " she said			0
" this is something i have felt strongly about for a long time : bullying by certain @entity53 groups will not be tolerated in a free country , " said @entity54 , who is @entity67			1
but @entity70 , a spokesman for the @entity71 , said the idea behind the group was offensive			1
" @entity53 discourages any visual representations of the prophets of @entity76 -- @entity79 , @entity78 , @entity8 , anybody -- because we believe it can lead to a form of idol worship , " he said			1
" the majority of @entity36 worldwide object to any representation of a prophet of @entity76 , " he said			0
the idea of " @entity11 " originated with a cartoonist who has since distanced herself from the idea , @entity54 and @entity70 said			1
" the whole campaign has been taken up by muslim - bashers and @entity92 , " @entity70 said			0
but @entity54 denied being anti-muslim			0
" this extends beyond being able to draw @entity8 , " she said			1
" if it 's offensive to you , that 's fine , but i do n't feel it 's right to impose your belief on others through intimidation			2
" this is nothing to do with hate or bigotry , " she said			0
" nobody is inciting violence or preaching open hatred towards individuals			0
" @entity54 said she is not a muslim but added that she had received " hundreds of e-mails from people trying to explain this to me			0
" one group member said she saw anger and fear on both sides of the controversy but felt that free speech could not be compromised			1
" this is a hot - topic debate , but so is abortion , illegal immigrants , gay marriage and politics			0
if we allow even a small compromise for one group , then the free speech on topics like abortion , illegal immigrants and politics can also be censored based on accusations that they cause violence or hate , " @entity124 said on @entity0 's @entity125			1
" hate speech is wanting a group eradicated , physically harmed or dead			2
i dont think drawing @entity8 falls under that category , " she said			1
" @entity53 is not above criticism or cartoons			0
i believe in equality , and censoring @entity8 while we can draw every other figure in the world does not equal equality , " she concluded			1
@entity54 said @entity2 's decision to block @entity4 was " ridiculous			0
" @entity4 is investigating the block , said @entity150 , the company 's director of global communications			0
@entity54 's group and a similar one had attracted about 7,000 fans between them wednesday			2
groups opposing the idea had about 68,000			2
@entity0 's @entity158 contributed to this report .			0

@entity163 : " bullying *...* will not be tolerated in a free country , " group *founder* says
new : council on @entity166 calls idea offensive
@entity169 *prompted* by calls for users to draw pictures of the @entity8
