@entity0 , @entity2 province , @entity3 -- the day begins with a count of the necessities for a joint operation with @entity3 troops -- among them 85 halal @entity9 ( meals ready to eat )			1
around the tactical headquarters , soldiers of the @entity13 get a taste of home before setting off into the wilder fringes of lawless @entity2 province			2
there 's baseball televised from @entity21 , replete with a rendition of the " @entity23 " by @entity24 , aged 11			2
one lieutenant has his mortgage approved by email ; another exclaims how he just ca n't wait to go home			0
" and tonight these soldiers plan an air assault into an area called @entity0 , where the @entity35 is basically the law			1
neither this unit , nor other @entity39 forces , will get to do many more of these as the drawdown of @entity42 forces gathers pace			1
adding an air of anticipation to the mission , the men at 4 corners believe two of the men they most want to take off the battlefield are in the area			1
they have a photo of one of them , with and without a heavy mop of hair			0
the helicopters arrive and , with the assistance of night vision for the @entity39 and some careful footwork by their @entity3 colleagues , they climb aboard			1
the helicopters touch down in a huge expanse of desert			0
the troops huddle in the coldest moment before the dawn , and then begin their approach			0
the mantra now is " @entity3 - led , " part of @entity73 's bid to make this an @entity3 - only war			1
the @entity3 soldiers are mostly from the north or northeast of @entity3 and to many locals they are strangers almost as foreign as the @entity39			1
they lead the way , set the tempo			0
and , for a mission that many of the @entity39 thought might have been one for special forces , that tempo is pretty relaxed			1
in large numbers , in daylight , they amble into town			0
they 're allowed into most homes ; would you say " no " when four dozen armed men arrive at your door ? when they meet a locked door , the @entity3 seem to turn away , particularly when a pocket knife ca n't prise the lock			1
it is remarkable to watch , and their casual attitude is contagious to the @entity39 , who are soon also ambling , in between the occasional grimace at how this operation is being led			2
soon it becomes clear that their prey has probably fled unless they 're remarkably lazy			0
sergeant @entity106 admits that " once they hear the birds they probably leave immediately			0
" but still they carry on , house to house , the first contact this village has had with the @entity3 government in over six months			1
at times , it has an almost random feeling			0
two boys are caught riding banned motorbikes			0
one @entity3 soldier considers shooting the bike 's fuel tank as a punishment , but decides that 's probably too dangerous even for him			1
so the soldiers let the tires down , and then the more sheepish biker is given a couple of heavy slaps around the head			0
instant justice , @entity3 - army style			2
far from western jurisprudence , but in rural @entity3 , this is often what passes as the law			1
as they pass through the village , locals seem bemused , friendly			0
as though visited by aliens , rather than caught in a war			0
this is not a place where @entity73 has power , or @entity3 's government even exists			1
captain @entity146 says he 's been told by locals that when the @entity35 lay booby traps for @entity73 , they issue a warning to villagers over the mosque loudspeakers			1
this is their form of law			0
@entity146 , with eight weeks left in his tour , accepts it 's likely @entity39 forces wo n't return to @entity158 soon			1
eventually , the insurgency makes an appearance			0
the @entity39 are searching a house where weapons had been found previously when shots are fired			2
there is confusion and the @entity3 army seem to relish the fight ahead			2
@entity39 airpower arrives quickly , with one of the heavily armed a10 warplanes buzzing the likely insurgent position			2
but after 20 minutes , it 's clear children and women are near the insurgent firing position			0
the @entity39 dispense with any idea of an assault			1
they head back into the village , and at dark move again -- across wide open fields to the landing zone			0
a whirr of @entity184 blades and a cloud of dust later , the @entity39 are gone , perhaps for the last time .			2

@entity39 soldiers plan air assault into @entity3 area where the @entity35 is basically law
@entity39 forces will likely not do many more of these as drawdown of allied forces gathers pace
mission fails to find two men targeted ; mood seems relaxed , says @entity4 's @entity201
village is not a place where @entity73 has power , or @entity3 's government even exists
