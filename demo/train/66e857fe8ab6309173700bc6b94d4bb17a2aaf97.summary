there 's a new scavenger hunt on the weekends in @entity4			1
cars snake around the blocks as drivers slow down to peer through what could be the windows of an abandoned warehouse covered in graffiti			0
or it could be the doorway to one of the city 's gourmet food markets , havens of organic produce , @entity19 cupcakes and fresh roasted coffees			1
three major markets have turned into anchors of redevelopment in the city , driving @entity4 's renaissance as the surrounding blocks become magnets for restaurateurs , artists , students and increasing numbers of tourists			1
the @entity33 ( 73 juta st. , @entity34 , @entity4 ; +27 11 403 0413 ) is a place people hear before they see it			1
on saturday mornings , artisanal food and hipster fashion fill the second and third floors of a parking garage			1
the entrance is down an alley off @entity44 and then up a ramp , but the way is marked and decorated with lights			0
it should n't be a struggle to find the entrance , just follow the crowds of @entity52 who come every week for lunch			0
for shoppers , there are cured meats , rustic breads , endless cheeses , cut flowers and raw chocolates			0
for diners , it 's a straight shot toward the back for a tray of raw oysters with champagne			1
those who prefer their food cooked can head across the way for the best fried chicken in the city ( served over watermelon and fries )			2
on chilly days there 's a potjie , a cast iron cauldron brimming with stew			2
up the stairs is an open - air level with seating that overlooks the neighborhood 's pricey new condos and the tangle of train tracks leading to @entity86 's main rail hub			2
a bit higher up is the fashion level , where racks of leather jackets hang alongside children 's dresses printed with @entity95 's beaming smile			2
the @entity34 neighborhood pulls a curious mix of people			2
one of the country 's most prestigious universities is nearby , along with the @entity101 ( 158 civic boulevard st. , @entity4 ; +27 11 877 6800 ) and the headquarters of some of the country 's biggest corporations			1
a decade ago , @entity34 felt like it had slipped irretrievably into urban decay			0
now it 's one of the most dynamic neighborhoods in the city			1
the people who pack into the market are the lifeblood of the small shops and galleries on the surrounding streets , which now do most of their business on saturdays selling photos taken by street kids , vintage clothing and high - design furniture			2
on the east end of downtown , the weekly market at @entity124 ( 268 fox st. , @entity4 ; +27 11 334 5947 ) opened five years ago in a century - old building that was originally a liquor warehouse			1
inside there now , there are craft beers and cocktails to sip every sunday while shoppers wander aisles of food as cosmopolitan as the city itself			2
there 's the option of sitting on a stool in a sunny courtyard and enjoying @entity143 coffee , then moving on to an @entity145 barbeque and @entity147 gelato			2
if that does n't suit , keep walking to find paella , burritos , dim sum and crepes			0
this is also one of the city 's best places to sample food from around @entity86			1
the traditional bread known as roosterkoek cooks on the braai barbecue , waiting to be stuffed with vegetables and meat			0
nearby is a table of curries from @entity164 , which can be served as " bunny chow " inside the hollowed end of a loaf of bread			0
there 's freshly sliced biltong , the dried meat that could be beef or game			2
out on the sidewalk , there 's a braai shack where fresh meats are grilled on the street and served with chips or pap , finely ground corn meal served thick like mash potatoes			0
when the eating 's done , the rest of the building and neighborhood make for a great walk			0
artists have set up studios and galleries around the warehouse where visitors can buy super-enlarged copies of iconic " @entity194 " magazine covers from the 1950s , see how prints are made or pick up a gorgeously illustrated art book			0
the surrounding streets host independent shops and cafes , as well as the city 's only art house cinema , the @entity202 ( 286 fox st. , @entity4 ; +27 11 039 7306 )			1
staying the night is an option			0
there 's @entity205 ( 302 fox st. , @entity4 ; +27 728 80 9583 ) , run by the charismatic @entity206 , who also organizes walking tours and volunteer experiences			1
a step above the backpacking circuit is the nearby 12 decades hotel ( 286 fox st. , @entity4 ; +1 866 332 3590 ) , offering boutique - style lodging in 12 rooms decorated by artists to reflect each decade of @entity4 's history			1
at the opposite end of @entity218 , @entity215 ( 1 fox st. , @entity216 , @entity4 ; + 27 84 057 0015 ) is the newest of the markets , housed in a complex of former mining warehouses			1
from the doorstep visitors can see the offices of the mining companies and banks built on @entity4 's gold wealth			1
inside , well - tended urban farm beds lead to a dizzying expanse of shopping and dining			0
indigenous plants like @entity234 melons are transformed into body creams , while old packets of laundry detergent and potato chips become purses and makeup bags			0
it 's the food , and drink , that draw in the crowds			1
bartenders pull pints of craft beers , next to an @entity248 - style barbecue stand and a taco stall			0
there 's a curious @entity252 infusion in many of the food stalls , with an emphasis on spicy salsas and novel chocolate sauces			1
and there 's the full range of traditional @entity86 market fare , including biltong and fantastic cheeses , but also a surprising selection of bubble teas -- the milky drinks often filled with tapioca pearls or fruit jellies that originated in @entity268			0
the driving force behind @entity215 is @entity270 , whose passion for @entity4 history has turned into a beloved series of walking tours , books and now this market that aims to turn into more than a weekend event			1
they 're currently open thursday through sunday , with a busy calendar of live music and performances			0
@entity283 is a writer and traveler based in @entity86			0
his latest project is a travel app for @entity86 cities for @entity288 and @entity289 .			0

gourmet food markets are *revitalizing* @entity4 's most depressed neighborhoods
