@entity1 ' ability to surf the @entity2 -- for the few in the isolated nation who could ever really go online anyway -- is rockier than ever			1
@entity6 reported on monday that the country 's @entity2 was down , after 24 hours of " increasing instability			1
" it stayed dead for more than nine hours , then came back to life -- but not for long			2
half a day later @entity11 said it was down again			0
then it was back up , at about 1 a.m. wednesday @entity15 time ( 11 a.m. tuesday et ) , the company said			2
but the assessment of @entity11 , a company that monitors internet performance worldwide , made earlier tuesday , did not change : " @entity1 continues its struggles to stay online			1
" the timing of @entity1 's latest internet issues makes them significant			1
they come days after the @entity24 government blamed @entity15 for being behind the hacking of @entity26 over that company 's production of " @entity29 " -- a comedy depicting the assassination of @entity1 leader @entity32 -- as well as threats against anyone who dared watch the movie			1
@entity1 denied any responsibility , even as it blamed the @entity24 government for being behind the making of the @entity40 - @entity39 film			1
its totalitarian government went on to officially make its own threat , warning the @entity24 that its " citadels " will be attacked , dwarfing the hacking attack on @entity26			2
@entity15 has n't leveled any blame or threats about its latest internet outage			0
but experts are skeptical that the @entity24 government had any involvement			2
that 's almost irrelevant , said @entity52 , a frequent traveler to @entity1 and former @entity54 correspondent			1
" the issue ... is not whether it was or it was n't ( the @entity24 that knocked out @entity1 's @entity2 )			1
the issue is what the @entity1 think it was , " said @entity52 , a @entity24 - @entity56 senior fellow			1
" and i think it 's safe to assume -- unless they themselves took their system offline for their own security , which is not impossible -- they 'll be looking to respond			2
" cyber conflict with @entity1 is ' dangerous uncharted territory ' expert : could be ' a 15 - year - old in a @entity70 mask ' so who is behind @entity1 's internet problems ? unlike the @entity26 cyberattack and threats , which were linked to a group called " @entity77 , " the latest issues have n't been tied to any group or government			1
it 's possible they have nothing to do with the @entity26 dust - up and are simply an internal matter			0
another possibility : @entity1 's internet traffic is routed through @entity87 , so issues or officials there may be to blame			1
another option : it could be a deliberate move by the country 's own government			0
" @entity1 may have disconnected themselves , either preemptively to prevent that movie from being distributed , but also , probably more likely , in a defensive posture , " said @entity94 , a cybersecurity expert and former executive assistant director of the @entity97			1
talking when @entity1 's @entity2 was totally down , @entity6 's @entity101 said " usually there are isolated blips " anyway in the country 's service			1
but he thinks what happened here was different			0
" i would n't be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack , " @entity101 said			0
@entity112 spokeswoman @entity111 deflected a question about the disruption			0
" we are n't going to discuss -- you know -- publicly , operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way , except to say that as we implement our responses , some will be seen , some may not be seen , " she said			0
no one is saying the @entity24 government could n't have carried out such an attack			2
but tech experts say it might not have needed to , given the ability of anyone , anywhere to do something like this			0
what happened with @entity26 , especially the studio 's decision to shelve -- at least temporarily -- the release of " @entity29 , " got a lot of people upset			0
@entity141 , president of the performance and security company @entity142 , told @entity54 he could n't say definitively that there was an attack at all			0
but if there was , he said it 's possible a lone individual , not an entire government , was behind it			0
" if it is an attack , it 's highly unlikely it 's the @entity24			1
more likely it 's a 15 - year - old in a @entity70 mask , " said @entity141 , tying the prospective attackers to those connected to or inspired by the hacktivist movement @entity155			0
limited technology , but not when it comes to hacking do these outages equal outrage , leaving @entity1 unable to view " @entity163 " for the 2 - billionth - plus time ? have they been frustrated when they tried to check on the latest @entity167 results for their fantasy teams or engage in heated debates about local , national and international politics ? no. there 's a reason the @entity173 ranks @entity1 second on its list of " @entity176			1
" only a smattering of " ruling elites " can go online freely , leaving the public limited to a " heavily monitored and censored ( intranet ) network with no connections to the outside world , " according to the advocacy group			0
widespread computer technology overall is n't a reality in one of the world 's poorest and , according to many outsiders , most antiquated countries			0
a 2012 report from @entity192 , @entity194 's internet development agency , noted @entity1 then had only 1,024 ip addresses -- unique numbers assigned to every device that logs on to the @entity2 -- in a country of about 25 million people			1
that figure may not exactly reflect the current usage since , for example , people can use one ip address for several items , but it 's still paltry by any modern measure			0
the @entity24 has more than 1.5 billion ip addresses			2
still , even if most @entity1 are n't web - savvy by design , a dangerous handful of them may be			1
@entity212 , who claims he worked as a computer expert for @entity1 's government before defecting seven years ago , told @entity54 he thinks that @entity15 has 1,800 cyberwarriors stationed around the world			1
he says even the agents themselves do n't know how many others work for the secretive group -- called @entity221 121 -- whose mission is to " conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states			0
" an @entity97 investigation linked the malware , infrastructure and techniques used by the @entity77 in the @entity26 attack to previous @entity1 cyberattacks			2
after that , @entity24 president @entity231 called the hack " an act of cybervandalism that was very costly , very expensive , " though he stopped sort of calling it an act of war			2
the next question is : will @entity32 , in @entity15 , say the same about his country 's internet issues ?			0

cybersecurity expert : @entity1 " may have disconnected themselves "
*research* company says @entity1 's @entity2 goes back down , only to return
monday 's web *blackout* lasted more than nine hours , according to @entity6
web disruption came amid *escalating* war of words between the @entity24 , @entity1
