-- when @entity4 appears on the news , sweat - soaked and breathless , railing against @entity7 and the government for failing to keep the oil in the @entity10 from reaching @entity12 's shores , the anguish on the politician 's face is real			1
" he takes this personally because he feels a great responsibility for the lives and livelihoods of the people of @entity20 , " said @entity13 , a parish employee who works for @entity4			1
" when he says things that some people take as controversial , he does n't mean to be controversial ; he 's just speaking from his heart			2
" among his more provocative statements : that the leadership of the @entity26 and @entity27 should be fired , that their plan of attack has been an " embarrassment			2
" " they had no plan to keep the oil out , even though they said it would n't come ashore			2
they had no plan to clean it up			0
they had no plan to make the fishermen whole			0
it 's like it 's being run with a bunch of seventh - graders , " the outspoken freshman parish president said last week			1
" this is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable			0
" @entity4 , president of @entity12 's southernmost parish , where the @entity48 meets the @entity10 , spoke with president @entity49 on friday about how to minimize the spill 's impact on a community whose livelihood depends on fishing and offshore oil industries			1
@entity4 has said he is confident in the president 's assurance that something would be done to protect the barrier islands , which come more than a month after the politician began sounding the alarm bell over the spill 's potential impact on @entity20 ' extensive network of marshes and waterways			1
@entity4 hopes berms can be built to protect the area from the oil , and the @entity26 was part of a discussion on the idea tuesday			1
" [ president @entity49 ] has the opportunity ... to do the right thing on these berms , " @entity4 said in a phone interview tuesday night			1
" if the truth gets back to him on these berms , i 'm confident he 'll do the right thing			0
" since the early days of the massive oil spill , the @entity12 native has been going non-stop , according to friends and family , waking up around 3 a.m. and returning home at 11 p.m. , after a full day of meetings , tours of the area and rounds on local and national news networks			1
" i worry about him			0
i 'm concerned about him dropping dead on me because he never stops , " said friend @entity91 , who has known @entity4 since his days as a local businessman			1
" i talk to his fianc√©e to find out about him , because i ca n't talk to him because he 's so busy			2
" @entity4 says his energy comes from wanting " to do the right thing			1
" " @entity96 always told me i had one speed : always wide open , " he said			0
" i ca n't rest as long as the job still needs to be done			0
" his outspokenness comes as no surprise to those who know him			0
before @entity4 became the weary face representing @entity12 's coastal communities , he was already known among friends and constituents as someone who 'd do anything to help others , who 'd open his home to strangers and stray animals alike			1
like most @entity115 natives , his backstory is tied to the industries that have sustained the region			0
he grew up in @entity118 , outside of @entity119 , working in his father 's cannery before starting his own business ventures			1
he was the second of four children and was known as the class clown who could never stay still and often brought home stray animals much to his parents ' chagrin , his sister , @entity123 , said			0
" @entity4 never sat down for a meal			1
he probably had [ attention deficit disorder ] , but they did n't diagnose it in those days			0
our father would tell him to sit in the corner , and he could not stand still , " she said			0
after high school , he attended @entity140 and @entity141 but did n't graduate , she said			0
inspired by his father , @entity142 , a local businessman and chairman of the state @entity144 , she said the younger @entity4 made an unsuccessful run for state representative and served on the state levee board in the 1980s			1
soon after he began working for his father 's business , which had evolved into a catering company for the offshore industry , providing cooks and food on oil rigs			1
during trips out to check on operations or fill in for someone who called in sick , @entity4 became aware of living conditions on the rig and came up with an idea for his own business : converting old shipping containers into living quarters			1
general @entity165 proved to be a great success , mostly due to @entity4 's finesse with clients , said @entity170 , a contractor who became a friend of @entity4 's after working with him			1
" he made it a priority to keep in touch with his clients and to listen to them			0
if they wanted modifications or a @entity182 , he 'd find a way to do it , " he said			0
he 's an idea man			2
he has a million ideas , and he is determined to make them all work			0
" by the time a @entity188 company offered to buy @entity189 from him for a reported $ 18 million , @entity4 had moved to @entity20 , bought property on a low level of land and turned his sights to raising elk			1
he acquired more than 100 head in @entity196 and corralled them in an area of his property , but could never bring himself to kill them , @entity170 said			0
" he treated them all like they were his kids , like puppy dogs , " he said			0
" i think he sent a few to the butcher , but you can also use their horns for vitamin supplements , so he ended up making a profit by grinding up their horns			2
" @entity4 lost most of his herd when @entity213 roared through @entity20 in 2005 , carrying some of the elk up to 30 miles from his property , @entity170 said			1
yet @entity4 eagerly participated in relief efforts , taking his airboat on rescue missions , opening his home to stranded people and abandoned animals , and helping to clear roads			1
on adjacent property , a riding facility that he built for handicapped children became a staging ground for relief efforts , where volunteers slept and supplies were stored , according to @entity13 , who worked on @entity4 's property coordinating relief efforts			1
" @entity4 is probably the most compassionate person that i 've dealt with on a regular basis and that compassion has never waned			2
it stays there all the time , " @entity13 said			0
" he was eager , at a moment 's notice , to help out			2
he stepped up , and he never refused anybody that he could assist			0
he 'd give you the shirt off his back and last dollar in pocket			0
" @entity4 says he ran for parish president in part because he did n't see the incumbent in the community during the @entity213 clean - up			1
" i saw absolutely no one standing up for the people of this parish , " he said			0
" people told me , ' you ought to run and quit complaining			0
' " since taking office in 2007 , those who know him say he has cemented his reputation as a dedicated champion of the beleaguered community through a long list of accomplishments in a short period of time related to recovery efforts			2
" i do n't think @entity4 ever really relaxes			2
i can get him out on the boat or hunting , and he 'll take it easy for a bit , but within 10 minutes , it 's back to the business of @entity20 , " said @entity170			1
" but he loves it			0
he takes great joy and pride in contributing to the improvement of the community			0
" @entity4 says he 'll keeping working hard as long as the oil threatens his parish			1
" things still need to be done to keep the oil out			2
... at the end of this thing , i have to know i did everything possible to save the parish and the coast land , " @entity4 said			2
