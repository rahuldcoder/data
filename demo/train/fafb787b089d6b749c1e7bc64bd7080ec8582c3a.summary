-- @entity2 's @entity1 admitted tuesday that pilot error was partly to blame for the crash of @entity5 in @entity6 last july , in which three people were killed			1
@entity8 , a spokeswoman for @entity1 , said the pilot was not solely responsible for the crash but " could have failed to respond quickly " to factors including problems with the aircraft 's auto throttle system			1
the auto throttle problem was compounded by inadequate warning systems to alert the flight crew when the plane 's airspeed fell too low , she said			1
the spokeswoman also cited the " flight crew 's failure to execute a timely go - around when the conditions required it by the company 's procedures			1
" another contributing factor was " air traffic control instructions and procedures that led to an excessive pilot workload during a high - energy final approach , " she said			0
as well as the three who died , scores of passengers were injured when the @entity35 struck the seawall at @entity37 and tumbled down the runway			2
in january , @entity1 filed a lawsuit against @entity35 alleging that some equipment on the plane was improperly installed or defective , resulting in inadequate warnings for the pilots about low airspeed			2
@entity46 investigators have also looked at what part an airport navigation system that was out of service while runway improvements were made may have played in the crash			0
@entity5 's pilot , capt. @entity52 , told the @entity53 last year that he found it " very stressful , very difficult " to land without the glideslope indicator that helps pilots determine whether the plane is too high or too low during approach			0
in february , the @entity46 @entity58 fined @entity1 $ 500,000 for failing properly to assist families affected by the crash			0
