-- after six days of protests that packed the state capitol , @entity3 's major teachers ' union called on members to start returning to work monday but keep fighting a proposed rollback of union protections for public employees			1
" to educators whose contracts do not recognize @entity19 , we call on them to return to duty by day -- and find ways to be vocal and visible after their workday is done , " @entity10 , president of the nearly 100,000 - member @entity11 , told members in a statement issued sunday afternoon			1
" to those whose contracts recognize @entity19 as a holiday , we call on them to return to @entity27			1
" but other unions said they plan to continue demonstrations into tuesday , and not all members of @entity10 's union had decided to follow her lead			1
members of @entity27 's @entity11 local , the @entity33 , have voted to remain at the capitol on monday at least , its president , @entity36 , told @entity0			1
" i think every teacher in here wants to be back with their students , but we also understand that there are important points to be made , " @entity27 high school teacher @entity37 told @entity0			1
" and so far , we 've done a good job of using our collective action to force the issue and to make sure people understand why we 're fighting			0
it 's an important fight to continue			1
" @entity3 's new @entity50 governor , @entity49 , is pushing a state budget bill that would severely curtail collective bargaining for public employees			2
@entity49 says the measures are needed to head off a $ 3.6 billion budget shortfall by 2013 that could result in thousands of layoffs			0
but the issue has triggered widespread resistance from unions , even those that wo n't be affected by the plan , and the 14 democrats in the state @entity64 have fled @entity3 to stall a vote on the plan			2
" it is not about specific negotiation points , " @entity67 , a member of the @entity68 and the @entity69 , told @entity0 on sunday			0
" it 's about the existence of unions , the fact that this bill would make it impossible for public unions to exist in @entity3			1
that 's what 's it 's designed to do , to destroy public unions			1
" the demonstrations caused schools districts to cancel classes in @entity86 and @entity27 for much of last week as large numbers of teachers took the day off work to protest			1
some teachers have been given doctors ' notes to excuse their absences from physicians sympathetic to their cause , protesters told @entity0			2
and an estimated 55,000 people turned out for saturday rallies at the capitol , mostly in opposition to @entity49 's plan			2
several thousand more packed the building on sunday , sending up a rousing cheer when a group of firefighters -- who , along with police , are exempt from @entity49 's proposed bill -- joined them in a show of support			2
speaking on " @entity111 , " @entity49 denied complaints that he was trying to break up public employee unions			0
but he said that collective bargaining has hindered local governments ' efforts to manage their finances " time and time again			0
" " the difference is , unlike those other states , i want to give those local governments the tools they need to balance the budget now and in the future , " he said			0
" they ca n't do that with the current collective bargaining laws in the state			0
" @entity49 called on the fugitive @entity62 to come back home , telling them , " if you want to participate in a democracy , you 've got to be in the arena			0
" but the senators said they 'll stay away unless @entity49 agrees to negotiations over his proposal , arguing that teachers have already agreed to pay more toward health care and pensions			0
" in return , they ask only that the provisions that deny their right to collectively bargain are removed , " state senator @entity140 , a @entity141 , said saturday			0
@entity0 's @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report			0
