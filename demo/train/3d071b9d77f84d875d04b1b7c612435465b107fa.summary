a finding that @entity0 is to blame for the bomb attack that killed five @entity3 tourists in @entity4 last july adds to pressure on the @entity5 to label the controversial group an outlaw terrorist organization			1

@entity3 killed in @entity4 bus terror attack , minister says @entity4 interior minister @entity17 told reporters in @entity19 that of the three people who carried out the attack , " we have established that two were members of the militant wing of @entity0			1
there is information that shows financing and the connection between @entity0 and the two suspects			0
" he also said the pair had traveled on genuine @entity31 and @entity32 passports , though it 's not clear whether the documents had been stolen			0
@entity4 explosion comes amid growing @entity37 - @entity3 tension @entity0 has said nothing about @entity3 's previous accusation that it was responsible for the attack , which occurred outside a bus waiting at the airport in the @entity4 resort of @entity44			1
the @entity45 and @entity3 seized on the conclusion of the @entity4 investigation to urge the @entity5 to move against @entity0			1
president @entity49 's counterterrorism adviser , @entity48 , said tuesday the investigation had exposed @entity0 as " a terrorist group that is willing to recklessly attack innocent men , women , and children , and that poses a real and growing threat not only to @entity55 , but to the rest of the world			1
" read more : the inner workings of @entity0 in a statement issued from the @entity60 , @entity48 said , " @entity4 's implication of ( @entity0 ) underscores the importance of international cooperation in disrupting terrorist threats			1
" we call on our @entity55 partners as well as other members of the international community to take proactive action to uncover ( @entity0 's ) infrastructure and disrupt the group 's financing schemes and operational networks			2
" @entity45 secretary of state @entity74 reiterated the call for @entity55 countries to " crack down on @entity0			2
" " we need to send an unequivocal message to this terrorist group that it can no longer engage in despicable actions with impunity , " he said in a statement			0
@entity3 prime minister @entity83 also commended the @entity4 investigation , saying : " the attack in @entity44 was an attack on @entity55 soil against a member country of the @entity5			1
we hope that the @entity55 draw the necessary conclusions as to the true character of @entity0			0
" @entity4 bus attack is work of suicide bomber , minister says @entity32 also joined the chorus , with foreign minister @entity95 issuing a statement saying : " we urge the @entity5 and all partners who have not already done so to list @entity0 as a terrorist entity and prosecute terrorist acts committed by this inhumane organization to the fullest possible extent			1
" a technical analysis of the explosion , carried out by a team of consultants and provided on background to @entity108 , said the @entity3 tourists had placed their luggage in a baggage compartment along the side of the bus and were boarding when the explosion occurred			1
the bomb -- concealed in a backpack -- went off in a confined space between two buses , instantly killing four of the tourists and the bus driver , as well as the bomber			0
the consultants ' analysis of closed - circuit video of the suspected bomber waiting in the terminal and of the remains of the device suggests that the bomb was detonated by remote radio control			0
residue from two radio transceivers was recovered from the scene , along with a dual - tone multiple - frequency circuit			0
the explosive charge was approximately 3 kilograms ( 6 pounds ) of @entity135 and ammonite , probably obtained from a @entity4 company , according to the consultants			0
police release composite image of @entity4 bus bomber whether the bomber intended to kill himself is unclear			0
it is possible that he planned to load the backpack on the bus and detonate it remotely as it pulled away			0
the premature detonation of the device before all members of the @entity3 group were on board the bus could have been caused by a malfunction or by violent movement , or it could have happened as the device was being armed			2
alternatively , an accomplice could have detonated the bomb from a nearby vantage point , in which case the bomber may have been deceived about his true role in the attack			0

analysts say the attack was not that of a " lone wolf " but rather required planning and reconnaissance , suggesting a well - orchestrated plan			0
last year , @entity174 , director of the @entity45 @entity175 , said in a congressional hearing that the @entity4 attack could have been part of a growing international campaign of terror attacks by @entity0			1
" since may 2008 , @entity0 plots against @entity3 targets in @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity3 have been disrupted , and additional operational activity in @entity187 has reportedly been uncovered , " @entity181 said			2
but while the @entity45 has stepped up efforts to interdict @entity0 's international financial operations , the group has enjoyed greater freedom in @entity55			1
@entity193 's annual threat report in 2012 concluded that nearly 1,000 @entity0 members and supporters lived there			0
@entity0 raises money quietly in several @entity55 cities , according to intelligence agencies , to support its extensive network of social programs in @entity13			0

@entity206 distinguishes between its military wing -- which is proscribed -- and its work as a political party in @entity13			0
@entity210 and other @entity5 states do not characterize any part of @entity0 as a terrorist organization			2
if the @entity5 moves toward unified sanctions against @entity0 , the current @entity13 coalition government led by prime minister @entity216 may be in jeopardy @entity218 , a @entity13 expert on @entity0 based at the @entity219 , told @entity108 , " since @entity216 formed his government two years ago , there has been steady @entity55 support			2
but since @entity0 is part of this government , more @entity5 member states are likely to dissociate themselves from @entity216 's government " if the link with the @entity4 bombing is confirmed			1
" since the 1980s , " he added , " the @entity45 listing of @entity0 on its list of terrorist organizations has been seen as a unilateral act , while the @entity13 party was improving its international relations , especially with @entity5 states			1
" @entity216 said tuesday his government is " ready to cooperate in clarifying the circumstances " of the attack " in fairness and safeguarding justice , " but he did not address the accusations against @entity0			0
@entity218 said that if @entity0 were designated a terrorist group by the @entity5 it would virtually eliminate the @entity55 role in mediating between @entity0 and @entity3 on such issues as negotiating prisoner exchanges			1
@entity193 has been especially active in mediating on humanitarian issues			0
but there have been signals in the past few months from senior figures in @entity252 's coalition that the mood is shifting			0
last august , the foreign policy spokesman for @entity252 's @entity255 , @entity256 , told the @entity257 it was " long overdue to place @entity0 on the @entity5 's list of terror organizations			1
