-- after nearly five years as @entity1 , former @entity3 gov. @entity2 surprised the nation and many of her friends with last week 's announcement that she was being nominated for appointment as the 20th president of the @entity11			1
but no one who knows her ( i have , personally and professionally for more than 30 years ) is at all surprised at why the @entity11 system wants her , or why she emerged as the nontraditional but consensus choice for the job among a pool of talented and qualified candidates			1
@entity21 will leave her @entity23 post as one of the most respected , trusted and personally admired figures of @entity27 's presidency			2
her new job will be another first in @entity21 's career : she was the first woman valedictorian at the @entity31 ; the first woman to be elected governor of @entity3 by popular vote ; first woman to head the mammoth , sprawling and unwieldy @entity37			1
and now the first woman president of the nation 's largest public university system			1
her positions have involved widely different subject portfolios , but there are common threads which reveal and reinforce her strengths			2
@entity21 knows how to herd cats			0
as governor and as @entity37 secretary , she presided over many disparate organizational fiefdoms			1
her great success in both jobs was to know how to play to their strengths to achieve common goals			2
in @entity3 a $ 1 billion deficit became surplus , without a tax increase			1
at @entity37 , she helped transform 22 agencies from across the federal government into what most now view as a single integrated @entity61			1
in the process , she has overseen the maturation of that department 's " one - size - fits - all " security approach to one that matches the strategy to the threat : intelligence - driven and risk - based			2
@entity70 -- the @entity70 -- was a @entity72 joke before she took office			1
remember @entity74 and " heckuva good job , @entity76 " ? @entity21 worked together with a top - notch professional , @entity70 director @entity77 , to lead the federal response to historic natural disasters ranging from @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 to record flooding in the @entity84 and major forest fires in the @entity86			1
in the process , @entity70 turned from a talk - show joke into a top - performing disaster response agency			1
@entity21 is not a limelight - seeker			0
she 's a results - obsessed lawyer and public servant who sets priorities			2
at the @entity3 border discussing immigration , on @entity98 beaches taking stock of daily progress in dealing with the @entity103 explosion and oil spill , visiting tornado - devastated communities in the @entity84 and hurricane - ravaged @entity107 beach towns , she walked beside those who were directly affected and ceded the key camera shots to them			1
she assumed responsibility and when she did take center stage it was as a public figure unafraid to deal with hostility and criticism -- as she did as the administration 's sole witness during the recent @entity120 hearings on the immigration reform bill			2
she brought years of front - line experience to the immigration debate and was a central figure in the ongoing discussions of reform			0
her approach was not to throw the baby out with the bathwater			0
it was to focus on getting rid of criminals and threats to national security , while understanding that immigrants -- like her own @entity136 family -- have contributed much to this nation 's prosperity and security			0
she has been was willing and ready to roll up her sleeves and work with all sides to construct an approach on immigration that works -- one that addresses both national security needs and immigrant potential			0
she applied her experience and expertise in many ways and behind the scenes , including in the final days of @entity120 debate on the " @entity155 " initiative , to remove roadblocks and move the process forward			0
@entity2 is also one of the warmest and most caring individuals i know			1
few are aware of the time she has devoted to help staff , family and friends in need			0
one example among many : a longtime mutual friend who served as director of constituent services in her @entity3 office was unexpectedly stricken with illness			1
the woman lingered in ill health for many weeks before her untimely passing			0
away from public and press attention , @entity21 went daily to her bedside , de facto family for an employee and friend who had lost most of hers long ago			0
in announcing the death , @entity21 paid tribute not only to the professional accomplishments but to the person with whom she had connected and befriended			0
" [ @entity184 ] played a critical role in the @entity186 , " @entity21 wrote			0
" what people may not know is that she was also an author , a hospice volunteer and a woman of deep faith			1
we 're only beginning to grasp how much we will miss her			0
" @entity21 has done exemplary work at the @entity37 , most of it away from the spotlight			2
she played a critical role in helping this administration succeed in areas where previous administrations had not			0
what people may not know is that she is a fan of football and opera and a friend who has your back			0
the students , faculty , administrators and regents who make up the @entity11 system are about to find all this out			1
i suspect that as the administration looks to replace her , it will begin to grasp how much it will miss her			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity225 : people who know @entity2 not surprised she 's to head @entity11 system
it 's another " first woman " *nod* for her . she was first @entity11 @entity31 valedictorian , first @entity3 governor
he says as governor , @entity37 chief brought organizational fiefdoms to common cause
@entity223 : she expertly handled emergency response , reviving @entity70 *reputation* ; is *humane*
