-- what turns a few cases of disease into thousands ? sometimes @entity4 , or cholera or other infectious diseases , emerge and are brought under control , but the current @entity4 crisis in @entity9 continues to grow			1
what makes the critical difference in quickly controlling an outbreak ? luck plays a part			2
where the first cases emerge , what the weather is like , the coincidence of holidays and migration can all make a difference in how quickly disease spreads			0
biology also matters , including the unexpected evolution of pathogens and the level of prior exposure and immunity in populations at risk			2
health infrastructure is important too			0
countries that invest little in health -- including training health personnel and public health surveillance and diagnostic capacity -- will struggle to mount a rapid and effective response			0
bad luck and lack of investment in health are hard to address once a disease starts to spread			1
however , a lot depends on how governments respond to the first cases that pop up -- and denying or minimizing the early cases is one of the worst things a government can do			2
indeed , restricting health information and imposing controls on the media breed mistrust and impede an effective response			0
another potential obstacle , which might seem counterintuitive , is quarantines			0
ebola cases first appeared in @entity9 five months ago , and so far , there have been more than 4,784 confirmed or suspected cases , and more than 2,400 deaths , according to the @entity61			1
as cases first emerged , the lack of information about the disease and suspicion of the government led to rumors that the reports of @entity4 were created by the government to secure -- and embezzle -- aid			1
although @entity4 is not transmitted by water , fears spread in @entity73 that the government was poisoning wells to increase the number of cases			1
in @entity79 , on august 29 , people rioted when a market was sprayed with disinfectant they believed was infected with the ebola virus , with more than 50 injured			0
people attacked health workers and the hospital in @entity79 's second largest city , @entity86 , shouting : " @entity4 is a lie ! " then quarantines were imposed			1
following an attack on an ebola treatment center in @entity91 , a populous neighborhood in @entity92 , @entity73 's capital , the government reportedly ordered a quarantine of the entire peninsula			2
the incidence of @entity4 was reportedly no higher in @entity91 than anywhere else in the city , but information minister @entity98 said the neighborhood was quarantined because of its density and the potential for political violence			1
the quarantine was abandoned after 10 days , but @entity98 declared it a success because it changed attitudes -- increasing awareness of the severity of the disease			0
isolating a community as punishment for not trusting the government neither fosters trust nor effectively limits transmission			2
during the quarantine period , the price of basic goods like food , water , coal , soap and phone cards doubled			0
the cost of rice tripled , to 90 cents a cup			0
early on , there were violent clashes between security forces and angry residents trying to leave			0
a 15 - year - old boy was fatally shot , and four other residents were wounded			0
in addition , residents who could afford it bribed security forces to get out , while others fled by swimming away or escaped when security was lax			0
access to routine health care inside the quarantine zone was limited and there were reports of pregnant women desperate for help			0
meanwhile , on september 6 in @entity145 , government officials announced a three - day quarantine to facilitate detecting cases through house - to - house searches			2
yet detecting @entity4 cases is not necessarily straightforward , and @entity145 does n't have sufficient capacity to hospitalize everyone it may identify			1
@entity153 issued a statement that " lockdowns and quarantines do not help control @entity4 as they end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers			1
this leads to the concealment of potential cases and ends up spreading the disease further			0
" so what can be done ? education and social mobilization campaigns that explain @entity4 and facilitate community participation in the response are key			1
social support and home - based care can increase trust and ensure that voluntary isolation measures are respected and people who are sick can be safely cared for at home			2
efforts to ensure that survivors are not shunned and stigmatized are also important , and survivors , who are immune from reinfection , can play an important role in the response			0
in other words : ensure that the @entity4 response respects human rights			1
access to health information and treatment , involving the community in the planning and response to the epidemic , making sure that restrictions on liberty and movement are imposed only when they are strictly necessary -- these are all human rights principles that are codified in international treaties			1
of course , respecting , protecting and fulfilling human rights is not a magic bullet to stop a disease in its tracks			1
but , as we 've seen in the current @entity4 outbreak , failing to implement a response in line with human rights principles can increase the risk that a small outbreak will become a much larger one .			1

outbreak of @entity4 has *claimed* more than 2,200 lives , according to @entity61
lack of info and suspicion of government made outbreak worse , says @entity219
education campaigns are key to limiting outbreak , he says
@entity219 : responses that violate human rights principles can increase risk of spread
