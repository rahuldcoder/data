earlier this year , a @entity1 court ruled that search engine operators such as @entity3 could be held responsible for personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties and found through their searches			1
as thousands of people ask for their information to be removed , is @entity3 is trying its best to provide a workable solution or trying to undermine a ruling that , from the very start , it really did not like ? in the commentary i wrote for @entity16 the day after the ruling in the @entity3 @entity19 case , i suggested the result created a headache -- and potentially huge costs -- for @entity3 , and that it could open the door to a flood of cases , each of which would need a resolution			1
i wrote that how @entity3 responded to the ruling would be critical -- and the initial signs are that the company 's response has already caused problems			1
as predicted , @entity3 received a huge volume of requests to have links removed -- more than 40,000 in the first four days after the ruling			1
the company has now begun the process of responding to them			0
if the request appears valid -- and how that is determined is one key issue -- there seem to be three parts to their response : first is the removal of the search result -- and it must be remembered that it is only search results when a particular name is searched for that are removed , not the source material nor search results for that material when searched for in any other way			2
@entity56 is that search results for individuals using @entity1 versions of @entity3 ( that is , google.co.uk rather than google.com ) will now often include a message at the bottom that reads : " some results may have been removed under data protection law in @entity1			1
" the curious are then offered the chance to " learn more " on the company 's privacy and terms page			0
this alert does not , however , mean that search results have been removed -- it appears if any search is made for an individual 's name where there are no " public figures " with that same name			0
thirdly comes the part of the response which has triggered the most dramatic results : if a link to an article is blocked as a result of a request , notification is sent to the publisher of that article			2
when journalists receive that notification they are , quite naturally , upset			0
two particular examples involving prominent journalists in the @entity91 have highlighted this -- and both have written about it			0
the first was @entity96 in the @entity97 , the second @entity98 for the @entity99			0
both wrote pieces about the experience ; @entity98 's had an understandably dramatic headline : " why has @entity3 cast me into oblivion ? " in both @entity96 's and @entity98 's cases , many of the stories that they had been notified about did not seem to fall into categories covered by the @entity3 @entity19 ruling : old , irrelevant stories about people who were not public figures			1
@entity96 's stories included pieces from 2010 and 2011 -- scarcely old -- while @entity116 's covered critical events in the banking world in 2007 -- the ousting of banker @entity119 from @entity120 -- something that can not be described as irrelevant or not in the public interest			2
it looked as though this was exactly what the opponents of the right to be forgotten were worried about : censorship and the rewriting of history			0
@entity98 , however , was not quite convinced , hence his headline that @entity3 was casting him into oblivion , not the @entity133			2
was it , in fact , that @entity3 were overreacting -- either that they were , as @entity98 put it , " clumsy " or that , perhaps , they were deliberately attempting to undermine the ruling by making it seem either unworkable or a dangerous form of censorship			1
that @entity3 might be deliberately undermining the ruling seems possible ; all three parts of their response could contribute to this view			1
firstly , they seem to be erring on the side of the people wishing for things to be blocked -- and hence they do create more censorship			2
secondly , by alerting about far more search results than are actually affected by the rulings , they create an atmosphere in which people feel more censored			0
thirdly , by the form which their notification to journalists takes , they make journalists feel censored -- and might make strong , important and expert journalists into allies in their attempts to undermine the ruling			1
the combination of these three is a potent one			0
on the other hand , it is possible that it is simply clumsy , and that these are teething troubles			0
@entity98 says : " @entity3 insists it is simply complying with the relevant articles in the @entity133 's ruling			1
" in a message to those seeking to have content removed , @entity3 itself acknowledges it is still " working to finalize our implementation of removal requests			1
" the individual cases that have made the headlines have begun to unravel a little : @entity3 has reversed its decisions on @entity96 's pieces , recognising there is a public interest			1
@entity98 's piece is more interesting			0
the assumption @entity98 made , reasonably enough , was that the link would be blocked when people search for @entity193 , since his was the only name that appeared in the article in question			2
but in fact , it turns out that the request to block the story related to a member of the public whose name appeared in the comments on the piece -- the link removed relates to searches for that person			1
searching for @entity193 still brings up the article			0
@entity3 's response is in line with the law -- but it looks far worse than it is			1
that , indeed , may be true of the whole story surrounding the right to be forgotten			0
it looks worse than it is			0
i hope that is the case , and that these events are just teething troubles , and that better , more workable solutions will appear , and a more appropriate balance between privacy and freedom of expression can be struck			0
how @entity3 's response develops in the weeks and months to come is the key -- and whether they really want to find a way to make it work will determine that			2
this whole affair demonstrates the huge power that @entity3 already wields			2
because , ultimately , it is @entity3 carrying out this " censorship , " not the court			1
@entity3 does similar things already , though without such a fanfare , in relation to copyright protection , links to things like obscene or illegal content and so forth			2
they are already acting as censors -- and as they tailor search results to the individual anyway , they are already choosing what people see and read -- and what they do n't see and read			0
the most important thing that @entity3 can do in response to the court ruling is to engage positively and actively with the ongoing reform process of the @entity249			1
a well - executed reform , with a better written , more limited and more appropriate version of the right to be forgotten could be the ultimate solution here			0
if that can be brought in soon -- rather than delayed or undermined -- then we can all move on from the @entity3 @entity19 ruling , both legally and practically			1
everyone might benefit from that .			0

thousands of people request removal of information about them from @entity3 searches
appeals follow court ruling that members of the public have a " right to be forgotten "
high *profile* journalists have questioned why their stories have been blocked
@entity275 says @entity3 may be sticking to *letter* of law to undermine ruling
