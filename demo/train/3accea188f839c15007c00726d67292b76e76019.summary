@entity0 -- high in a rugged , mountainous region in @entity6 's north , the country 's army remains locked in a conflict that seems to contradict the image of a nation committed to abandoning its brutal past			1
days after a government - ordered ceasefire on january 19 , clashes were reported between @entity6 soldiers and the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) around the town of @entity18 on the @entity20 border			1
the @entity6 government said its troops were ordered to fire only in self - defense , but the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , the @entity16 's political arm , claimed it was under attack @entity18 is the headquarters of the @entity16 and the @entity24			1
around 20,000 people live there , and thousands more are sheltering in temporary camps around the town after being driven from their homes , according to human rights groups and other reports			2
" people who live in @entity18 , they are standing by to flee			0
every day they hear bombing and the noise of guns			0
the government is saying that it 's stopped the offensive , but the reality in the @entity45 area it has not stopped , and the fighting and the offensive is ongoing , " @entity39 , coordinator for the @entity40 told @entity1 on tuesday			1
though based in @entity48 , @entity39 said she 'd been speaking with people in @entity18 who were " afraid for their future			0
" she said they were digging holes to shelter from the shelling , and were desperate for the fighting to stop			0
why has fighting intensified now ? in a statement dated january 18 , the @entity6 government said that it had requested back up from the @entity59 to ensure " accurate hitting of @entity24 / @entity16 targets " after repeated attacks on convoys seeking to resupply an outpost near @entity18			1
it accused the @entity16 of blasting roads and bridges , attacking troops and recruiting and abducting civilians to aid its fight			2
despite the government 's self - defense claims , @entity72 , a consultant to @entity73 ( @entity73 ) , told @entity1 the government appeared to have recently stepped up attacks on @entity79 fighters , possibly in an attempt to gain more ground and leverage in any future peace talks			1
" some of the strategic outposts that the @entity6 government has been attacking over the last several weeks are strategic to the protection of @entity18 so i think that appears to be the target , " said @entity72 , who wrote a damning report for @entity73 on the conflict between the two sides called " @entity87 in @entity6 's @entity45 , " which was released in march 2012			1
how long have they been fighting ? the @entity6 army and the @entity16 -- which formed more than 50 years ago -- have been trading shots since a series of incidents brought a sudden end to 17 - year ceasefire in june 2011			1
@entity72 said tensions rose after leaders of the @entity24 were unable to participate in the november 2010 election -- the first vote to be held in @entity6 in 20 years			2
according to @entity72 's report , the @entity6 army launched a " major military offensive " on june 9 , 2011 , to which the @entity16 rapidly responded by blowing up bridges , planting land mines and ambushing military convoys			1
at the time , conservationists claimed the two sides were fighting for control of a multi-billion dollar hydropower dam project on the @entity114 , one of several being built in the region			0
however , dams are not the only source of tension in the area , @entity72 said			0
it is also rich in mineral deposits , including the jade mines of @entity124 , a source of some of the world 's most valuable stones			0
and pipelines snake through the state delivering lucrative oil and gas to @entity20			0
how has the world responded ? news of the escalation of attacks in @entity45 has raised concerns outside the country as the international community keenly watches @entity6 's transition to democracy from a military regime			1
" we 're obviously deeply troubled by the increased violence , " @entity144 spokeswoman @entity143 said in a news conference in early january			0
later , @entity20 urged both sides to " exercise maximum restraint " after a bomb landed about 500 meters over the @entity20 border on january 15			0
" we believe that talks are the only correct solution to the north @entity6 conflict and expect all related parties to seek a ceasefire and start negotiations , " said foreign ministry spokesman @entity152 on january 22			2
the @entity161 welcomed president @entity163 's calls for a january 19 ceasefire but the @entity166 's @entity165 on @entity6 , @entity167 , said it did not want renewed tensions to " undermine the overall direction of reform and transformation in the country or adversely affect the positive international atmosphere that had been generated so far			1
" since coming to power in march 2011 , @entity163 has won praise for steering the country on the path of reform , easing media restrictions , granting amnesty to political prisoners and opening up the political system to competing parties			0
how committed is the government to peace ? days after the apparent failure of the ceasefire , @entity163 reiterated that he wanted the fighting to stop			2
" i have ordered the @entity189 ( @entity6 's military ) and other relevant government agencies to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict , " he told @entity6 's first @entity188 on january 21			2
he also suggested that the @entity24 would need " to reciprocate in a similar way			0
" the @entity24 is the only one of 10 armed ethnic groups in @entity6 that has n't yet agreed a long - term ceasefire with the government			1
talks would start soon with the other ethnic groups , @entity163 said , as he again extended an invitation to the @entity16 to join the process			1
" my government will continue to do everything necessary to turn ceasefire agreements into lasting peace , " he said			2
" it is very important to create job opportunities in order to improve socio - economic conditions of internally displaced people and ceasefire groups , " he added			1
how have civilians been affected by fighting ? since june 2011 , tens of thousands of @entity215 have been terrorized by renewed fighting , according to @entity73			1
more than 90,000 people have been forced from their homes , according to the latest estimates			0
however , the exact number of internally displaced people -- or @entity222 as they 're known -- is hard to confirm because the government has limited access to the region			0
the lack of access has worried aid agencies who say tens of thousands of people are being denied vital care			0
" the government feels it 's unsafe so they 're not granting access , " said @entity232 , @entity234 's @entity233 for @entity235			0
" we 've tried to support some of the areas with drug supplies but the roads that we 've used in the past are generally inaccessible , because that 's where the fighting usually takes place , so it 's been difficult to resupply			0
" she called on the government to allow humanitarian agencies " independent and neutral access " to affected areas , while @entity72 warned of " a looming humanitarian emergency			0
" what are the chances of a long - term ceasefire ? there are no easy solutions to resolve the unrest in @entity45			1
it dates back to the early 1960s when the @entity24 and @entity16 were established to protect the interests of the @entity79 people against the influence of the central government			2
the @entity24 still has administrative control over most of @entity45 , providing schooling , teacher training colleges , a police service , a tv station , newspapers , libraries and hospitals , according to the @entity275 website			2
@entity73 says the latest offensive has deepened divisions between the @entity215 and the government , which threatens to spill over into other ethnic groups			1
" you have an entire population of ethnic @entity79 who for the most part right now are very bitter towards the @entity6 government and that 's going to be a serious problem , not only for @entity45 but the other ethnic nationalities throughout the country right now who are negotiating peace agreements			1
" they 're taking all this into consideration so this could pose a serious problem for long - term peace in the country , " he said .			0
