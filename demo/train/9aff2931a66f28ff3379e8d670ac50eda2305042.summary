-- for more than a decade of my life , i struggled with debilitating anxiety , panic attacks and depression			1
and , like millions of people around the world , i longed to discover a magic pill to cure my ills and promise me nirvana			1
but , despite taking many medications , ongoing psychotherapy , electroconvulsive therapy ( @entity15 ) , hospitalizations and failed suicide attempts , wellness remained a distant dream			1
the anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants worsened my symptoms , and made me more agitated , depressed and suicidal			1
and i was utterly confused why the medications that were supposed to alleviate my symptoms exacerbated them instead			1
staring out of the fifth - floor hospital window one day after yet another failed suicide attempt , i promised to take charge of my life and create a life of wellness			1
i was sick and tired of being a chronically mentally ill patient			1
i just wanted to be well			2
most of all , i wanted to be able to take my little girl to school , play with her in the park , and tuck her to bed at night with her favorite story			2
somewhere deep in my soul , i was convinced that the medications were making me sicker instead of helping me heal			1
so , despite my fears and those of my family , i decided to listen to my inner wisdom and wean myself off all medications under the supervision of my psychiatrist and explore holistic pathways to health and wellness			1
transcendental meditation when a medical resident at the hospital suggested i try transcendental meditation to manage my anxiety and depression , i did			1
ironically , it was an @entity53 teacher , @entity54 , who taught me this life - affirming practice that had originated in @entity57 , my country of birth			2
i still remember sitting cross-legged on a @entity60 carpet across from @entity54 , in the dining - room - turned - shrine in her home			2
while @entity54 sat still , @entity67 - like , eyes closed , breath steady , body relaxed , face serene , my breath was erratic , my eyelids fluttered like the wings of a hummingbird , and my " monkey mind " ran amok			2
but , one day , one breath at a time , i learned how to sit still			2
despite my mind 's tendency to wander , like a mother lovingly guiding her wayward child back to its task i learned to gently guide my mind back to its still center			2
there , i discovered an oasis of energy , creativity , and restful calm			0
in time , meditation offered me a sacred space to reflect on my life , and taught me to become an observer of my thoughts and emotions instead of getting entangled in them			0
eventually , the daily practice of meditation helped me regulate my emotions and live each moment with mindfulness			0
ultimately , meditation set me free from the limitations of my suffering , and awakened me to a life filled with eternal possibilities			0
exercise during a visit , my psychiatrist recommended i start exercising , and educated me about the benefits of exercise in managing my anxiety and depression and promoting overall well - being			1
i joined a health club and started working out three times a week , attended aerobics and yoga classes and trained with free weights			0
i fell in love with my yoga classes			0
they relaxed and rejuvenated my mind , body , and spirit			0
having never been athletic , i was surprised to find that exercise energized me and elevated my mood			0
it also provided a much - needed reprieve from my duties as a mother and homemaker , and helped me create a social network outside of my family			0
cognitive behavioral therapy although i was highly skeptical about how talking with a therapist could help me heal , it transformed my life			0
for the first time in my life , dr. @entity136 , my therapist , explained how our thoughts , feelings , moods and behavior were interwoven , and taught me how to identify negative , self - defeating thoughts and replace them with positive , life - affirming thoughts			0
she also taught me how to regulate my breathing to manage my anxiety , and self - talk to break through the vicious cycle of depressive ruminations and suicidal ideation			1
she recommended i read " @entity152 " by dr. @entity153 , which further reinforced the skills she taught , and served as a workbook for my life			0
difficult at first , with practice the cognitive behavioral skills gradually became autonomous as breathing			0
@entity160 once said , " the world we have created is a product of our thinking ; it can not be changed without changing our thinking			0
" the tools of cognitive behavioral therapy , in essence , helped change my thinking , and , therefore , my world			0
over the past 24 years , i have learned that wellness does not come encapsulated in a pill ; rather , it encompasses the way i live			0
the consistent practice of transcendental meditation , exercise , and cognitive behavioral therapy have helped me thrive in life despite recurrent bouts of anxiety and depression			1
depression is no longer a demon i fear , it is a teacher whose wisdom i seek			1
