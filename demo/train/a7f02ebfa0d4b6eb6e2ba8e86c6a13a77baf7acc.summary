-- president @entity2 's @entity1 finally wore off , and thus he began the second presidential debate with @entity4			1
@entity2 's performance tuesday night was stellar ( but not perfect ) because of two techniques that i push to my debate teams ad nauseam			1
the first is the primacy effect , and the second is using your opponent 's language against him			1
if you want to win a debate , you 've got to master these techniques			0
the primacy effect is the idea that the first things a speaker says are more persuasive than those that follow			1
it holds true in conversations , in 90 - minute debates , and even over a series of speeches or debates			0
he lacked passion in the previous debate , but when answering the first question from the audience tuesday night , @entity2 brought the heat			2
early on he said @entity4 did n't have a five - point economic plan , but " a one - point plan " -- that " folks at the top play by a different set of rules			2
" right away we knew this was a different @entity2			2
yeah , i know , everyone 's probably talking about that comment because it 's a good sound bite			0
but for me , it 's the primacy effect taking off			1
i teach my debaters that you 've got to make your best arguments early in the speech			0
otherwise you might not have the judge 's full attention when you get to your best arguments , thereby lessening the weight of your position			0
opinion roundup : @entity2 bounces back , dominates debate i guarantee you this one answer -- the " one - point plan " -- will be talked about more than any other ( aside from that silly " binders full of women " distraction ) , partially because the president was memorable here , but mostly because of the primacy effect			1
the second debating concept i preach is the importance of language choices			0
if a team i coached ever concluded a debate without using their opponents ' language against them , i 'd want to make them run laps			0
( ok , that 's a terrible idea -- picture in your mind a debate team running laps			2
) @entity2 used @entity4 's language against him time and time again , and it was effective			1
here are some examples of @entity2 quoting @entity4			2
" this plant kills " ( from a @entity4 quote illustrating his flip - flop on coal plants ) ; @entity4 's assertion that promoting a lower tax rate for the most wealthy @entity98 " grows the economy ; " " i 'll get back to you on that , " his spokesman 's initial response on @entity4 's stance on the @entity91 bill , which makes it easier for women who have been discriminated against over equal pay to sue employers			1
debaters ca n't easily get out of arguments when you quote their own words			0
it 's a timeless , winning strategy			1
opinion : how @entity2 aced comeback moving further forward in the debate , @entity4 used the same technique responding to the sixth question , when asked what the president had done or accomplished to earn our vote			1
unemployment , @entity115 , @entity117 and immigration were all subtopics that @entity4 used when answering this particular question			0
and he began each of these issues with the phrase " he said ... " when referring to @entity2			0
he followed this by reminding the audience of @entity2 's perceived shortcomings on these issues			2
it was @entity4 's best moment of the debate			1
unfortunately , it came almost an hour into it			0
in fact , it took @entity4 almost an hour until he had a clearly favorable exchange			0
because of the primacy effect , undecided voters wo n't likely remember the stuff in the middle of the debate as much as the points at the beginning			1
it 's good for @entity4 that this was n't the first debate , because @entity2 's performance was much stronger tuesday night			1
the primacy effect over these two debates might have just saved @entity4			1
i expect the president to get a bump in the polls from this debate , but it could have been worse for @entity4			2
think about it : if we simply reversed the order of the debates , the race for president would look very different right now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			0

@entity165 : @entity2 revived himself and gave a stellar ( but not perfect ) debate performance
he says @entity2 used " primacy effect " technique to be most persuasive first thing in debate
he says @entity2 also used @entity4 's own words against him , a timeless , winning strategy
@entity165 : @entity4 used that technique too , but late in debate ; lost *valuable* time in waiting
