-- the full @entity2 @entity1 granted a stay of execution for a @entity6 death row inmate whose rare birth defect , his lawyers argued , would have made his death an " excruciating " process			1
the stay will remain in place pending the 8th @entity15 's ruling on the matter , a court document said wednesday			1
@entity17 had been scheduled to die early wednesday at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity6			1
it would have been the first execution since @entity22 botched a procedure last month			0
@entity17 , who turned 46 last week , is already in pain , as his condition includes unstable tumors in his head and neck , causing him to bleed regularly from his mouth , nose , eyes and ears , said defense attorney @entity33			1
dr. @entity34 of @entity35 filed an affidavit in the case saying that @entity17 's airway is so " severely compromised and obstructed , " especially when he 's lying flat , that it could easily be ruptured , raising the risk that @entity17 could choke or suffocate			1
" if you touch it , it bleeds , " @entity34 wrote of @entity17 's airway			2
in 1997 , a jury convicted @entity17 of first - degree murder , kidnapping and first - degree burglary and recommended the death sentence , court documents show			2
he was accused of fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend 's presumed new boyfriend , @entity49 , and firing at @entity49 ' son , 6 , before kidnapping @entity52			0
after raping his ex-girlfriend , he became involved in a gunfight with authorities , during which @entity17 and a @entity6 state trooper were injured , according to court documents			2
controversy over lethal injections has been brewing in recent years after @entity61 manufacturers , including the @entity63 - based manufacturer of pentobarbital , banned @entity2 prisons from using their drugs in executions			1
in 2009 , the @entity2 - based manufacturer of sodium thiopental , a drug also commonly used in executions , stopped making the painkiller			1
many states have scrambled to find substitutes from overseas or have used @entity2 - based compounding pharmacies to create substitutes			2
attorneys for death row inmates in several states have flooded the court system , arguing that correctional facilities ' secrecy over where and how they obtain drugs is unconstitutional and violates the @entity86 's " cruel and unusual " punishment clause			0
last month , @entity22 used a new three - drug injection protocol to execute convicted murderer and rapist @entity89 , but his vein collapsed , and he died of an apparent heart attack			2
a full investigation and autopsy results are still pending , but witnesses said they saw @entity89 struggling to speak as he convulsed and writhed on the gurney			0
previously , @entity22 inmate @entity96 said during his january execution , " i feel my whole body burning			0
" @entity96 was executed using a cocktail that included pentobarbital , as was @entity102 ' @entity101 , who also complained of a burning sensation during his april execution			0
also in @entity102 , @entity106 's attorneys challenged the state 's plan to administer pentobarbital to their client			0
a federal court stayed his execution last week , not because of the drugs @entity102 planned to use but because his defense team deserved more time to make the case that @entity106 was intellectually disabled			0
on monday , the @entity116 @entity1 weighed in on the issue , reversing a stay of execution for inmate @entity120 after his attorneys argued last year that a statute keeping the compounders of lethal injection drugs " a confidential state secret " was unconstitutional			1
" we hold that it is not , " justice @entity126 wrote in the 33 - page majority opinion			0
he said the reason for keeping such information private is " obvious , including avoiding the risk of harassment or some other form of retaliation from persons related to the prisoners or from others in the community who might disapprove of the execution as well as simply offering those willing to participate whatever comfort or peace of mind that anonymity might offer			0
" appeals court stays @entity102 execution after intellectual disability claim opinion : it 's time to televise executions @entity152 suggests fixes for death penalty in @entity2 @entity0 's @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			1
