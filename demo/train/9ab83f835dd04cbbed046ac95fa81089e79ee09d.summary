@entity1 authorities gave their most dire judgment yet thursday as to what they believe happened to missing toddler @entity4 , with a police spokesman saying " there 's nothing we have found that leads us to believe she 's alive			1
" " based on everything we know -- the thousands of hours of investigation , the 1,127 leads that have come in , the searches , the dives and the evidence gathered -- we think it 's highly unlikely that @entity4 will be found alive , " said state police spokesman @entity11			1
" nothing points us in that direction			0
@entity4 was 20 months old when her father , @entity23 told police he had put her to bed around 8 p.m. on december 16 in a first - floor bedroom of her grandmother 's @entity28 , @entity1 , home			1
the toddler 's father , her aunt and the father 's girlfriend were in the home at that time			1
@entity23 called police the next morning , just before 9 a.m. , to report @entity4 missing			1
authorities believe , as they have said previously , that there was " foul play " involved in the girl 's disappearance and they opened a criminal probe , @entity37 told reporters thursday			2
but her body has not been found and no one has been named a suspect in the case			2
" she did not leave that home by herself , and she was not abducted , " the state police spokesman said			2
on thursday , as he has done previously , @entity37 suggested the adults in the house with @entity4 the night before she was reported missing -- including her father -- have not been totally forthcoming			1
the police spokesman said there has not been " a lot of communication with the three adults who were inside the home that night			2
" at the same time , he said " it 's way premature to start speculating on charging anyone			0
" " they were the adults and they were there , and they may have answers , " said @entity37			0
" @entity23 was the father , ( and ) we believe he knows more than he has told us			0
" authorities called @entity4 's parents shortly before thursday 's press conference to tell them they 'd be stating they presume their daughter is dead			1
the toddler 's mother , @entity71 , was " thankful for the call , " said @entity37 , as was @entity23			0
as for the father , " his reaction was no reaction , " the spokesman said			0
local attorney @entity77 announced at thursday 's press conference that the $ 30,000 reward offered for information leading to @entity4 or the arrest of the person or persons responsible for her disappearance would expire at the end of june			2
the hope is that someone will come forward in the next 30 days			0
even if they do not , authorities vow that the lapse in the reward offer has no bearing on the investigation			0
to that point , @entity37 promised there will be more searches and that -- even though police are now stating they believe @entity4 is dead -- " this is still a missing person 's case			1
" " we are committed to this investigation , no matter how long it takes , " said @entity28 police chief @entity98 , noting two members of his department will remain assigned to the case .			0
