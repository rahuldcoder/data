-- the two @entity2 journalists released from @entity3 last month after five months in captivity said " the psychological wounds of imprisonment are slow to heal			1
" freed @entity2 journalists @entity8 and @entity9 said they spent less than a minute on @entity3 soil			1
in a column posted on the @entity13 web site tuesday night , @entity8 and @entity9 also said they were seized by @entity3 soldiers on @entity16 soil			1
they raised suspicions about their guide and wondered if they had been " lured into a trap			0
" " we did n't spend more than a minute on @entity3 soil before turning back , but it is a minute we deeply regret , " they said			1
working for @entity25 - based @entity24 , a media venture of vice president @entity27 , the two journalists were arrested in march after stepping on @entity3 soil			1
they were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor and eventually pardoned by @entity3 leader @entity29 after he met with president @entity30 early in august			2
@entity8 and @entity31 did n't go into much more detail about their experience in captivity , saying there are " things that are still too painful to visit			2
" but they provided information about the day of their arrest and reporting on @entity3 defections to @entity16 and the human trafficking industry that supports them			1
accompanied by a guide , the pair said they had been at the " frozen " @entity49 on march 17 separating @entity16 and @entity3 " to document a well - used trafficking route			1
" " as the sun appeared over the horizon , our guide stepped onto the ice			0
we followed him , " they said , referring to a @entity3 - @entity16 man they said has worked for foreign journalists			1
a producer , @entity61 , was also with them			0
the border between @entity16 and @entity3 was not clearly marked , and it had no fences or barbed wire , they said			1
" but we knew our guide was taking us closer to the @entity3 side of the river			2
as he walked , he began making deep , low hooting sounds , which we assumed was his way of making contact with @entity3 border guards he knew , " they said			2
the journalists said that the guide told them he called people in @entity3 the night before to arrange an interview , but that effort failed			1
however , he said he would show the journalists " the no - man 's land along the river , where smugglers pay off guards to move human traffic from one country to another			2
" " when we set out , we had no intention of leaving @entity16 , but when our guide beckoned for us to follow him beyond the middle of the river , we did , eventually arriving at the riverbank on the @entity3 side			1
" he pointed out a small village in the distance where he told us that @entity3 waited in safe houses to be smuggled into @entity16 via a well - established network that has escorted tens of thousands across the porous border , " they wrote			1
the women said they became nervous and headed back to @entity16			2
" @entity108 across the ice , we heard yelling			0
we looked back and saw two @entity3 soldiers with rifles running toward us			0
we were firmly back inside @entity16 when the soldiers apprehended us			0
" they wrote that @entity61 and the guide outran the guards , but the two women got caught			0
" we tried with all our might to cling to bushes , ground , anything that would keep us on @entity16 soil , but we were no match for the determined soldiers			2
they violently dragged us back across the ice to @entity3 and marched us to a nearby army base , where we were detained			0
" the women have raised doubts about their guide			0
they said he " seemed cautious and responsible " in the days before the capture , and noted he was always concerned " about protecting our interview subjects and not taking unnecessary risks			0
" " in retrospect , the guide behaved oddly , changing our starting point on the river at the last moment and donning a @entity16 police overcoat for the crossing , measures we assumed were security precautions			1
but it was ultimately our decision to follow him , and we continue to pay for that decision today with dark memories of our captivity			0
" they said " to this day , we still do n't know if we were lured into a trap			0
" " with guards right outside the room , we furtively destroyed evidence in our possession by swallowing notes and damaging videotapes			0
during rigorous , daily interrogation sessions , we took care to protect our sources and interview subjects , " they wrote			0
the women said they were in that region of @entity3 " to raise awareness about the harsh reality facing these @entity3 defectors who , because of their illegal status in @entity16 , live in terror of being sent back to their homeland			1
