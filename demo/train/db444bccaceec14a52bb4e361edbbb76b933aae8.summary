@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 had everything going for her -- a blossoming career , a wonderful life and a beautiful face			1
but that all changed after a horrific acid attack in march 2008 destroyed everything as she knew it			1
the young model and television presenter , who was 24 years old at the time , was leaving her apartment in a @entity0 suburb when she was attacked by a stranger waiting for her with a cup of sulfuric acid			1

she was also left blinded in one eye			0
@entity17 was asked by @entity3 's former boyfriend , @entity26 , to throw the acid on her face because she ended their short relationship			1
to make matters worse , two days before the attack , @entity3 was raped by @entity26 in a @entity0 hotel room after ending the partnership			2
" it was n't a random attack and there was a motive if you like , " @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity35 on @entity36			2
meanwhile @entity3 's parents were called by the police to tell them what had happened			1
" i can remember going ' not her face , please not her face ' , " @entity3 's mother @entity45 wrote on the @entity47 web site			1
" i knew if anything happened to her face as far as she was concerned it would be the end of everything			0
" @entity3 spent nearly two months in hospital and was placed in an induced coma for 10 days			0
the attack also severely damaged @entity3 's throat and she was forced to be fed through a tube in her stomach			1
today , @entity3 now wears a special plastic pressure mask for 23 hours a day , in an effort to flatten her scars			0
" you can see looking at me that it physically changed my appearance , but it goes a lot deeper than that			0
" " it changed my life as i know it -- it changed my career , it changed my relationships with people			0
@entity26 was found guilty of inciting the acid attack in october 2008 and subsequently convicted on the rape charge in april 2009			1
he was given two life sentences , and will serve at least 16 years in jail			0
@entity17 received a 12 - year sentence for throwing the acid			0
with her attackers behind bars , @entity3 is determined to get her life back on track and rebuild what she can			1
" @entity85 was a great healer and i 've managed to not get my old life back , but i can rebuild			2
and i think i 've stayed focused and determined			0

i try to stay positive			0
" @entity3 has told her story around the world and has started the @entity47 to help raise money for burns victims across the @entity95			2
since the attack @entity3 has made remarkable progress			1
surgeons took the drastic measure to remove the skin from @entity3 's entire face and use a skin substitute called @entity103 to re-build the foundations before grafting skin from her back and buttock onto her face -- it 's the first operation of its kind to be done in one operation , according to @entity3 's web site			1
@entity3 plans to continue her work raising money for burn victims and to help spread the message that there is life after difficult challenges			2
