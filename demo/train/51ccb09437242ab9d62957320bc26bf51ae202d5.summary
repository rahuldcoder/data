$ 440 , available at @entity240 bike - powered @entity242 battery charger cycling and cell phones go together like @entity245 and denial , so its a pity that gps navigation and fitness apps aimed at riders suck down battery power so rapidly			1
the solution has finally arrived in the form of the bike - powered @entity242 battery charger			1
crowd - funded via @entity256 and due out just after @entity257 , the tiny device attaches to the rear wheel , where it converts revolutions into enough juice to amp up any usb - charged gizmo			1

it 's light , sturdy , looks decent and can fit enough extras to accommodate all other clothing needs for a short one - bag - only business trip			1
it can also get on the plane as carry - on			2
at $ 149 , there 's a chance it could be sneaked onto the company expense account			2
