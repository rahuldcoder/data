@entity0 -- a picture may be worth a thousand words , but for foster children in @entity0 and across the country , a picture is worth improved self - esteem , and potentially , a new home and family			1
as part of @entity11 , @entity12 along with more than 100 other @entity12 locations in the @entity14 and @entity15 have teamed up renowned celebrity portrait and fashion photographers			1
the photographers will take pictures of children in the foster care system in need of permanent adoptive families -- in hopes the kids will be seen in a different light			1
on wednesday evening at @entity0 's @entity28 , some foster kids found themselves staring back at their larger - than - life - sized pictures among the lights of @entity32 at a grand opening exhibit held in their honor			1
for celebrity photographers such as @entity36 , whose clients include @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 ; @entity41 , whose shutters have exposed the likes of @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 ; and @entity47 , whose works are in the permanent collections of the @entity50 as well as innumerable magazines , volunteering their time and studios made for a change and reward , but came with challenges			1
" i was hoping i could make them feel comfortable and make them feel special -- i wondered if i 'd be able to do that , " @entity47 said , voicing concern that she " ... wanted to get ' them ' on film , not make them into anything			2
" @entity65 , a celebrity photographer who counts @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 among his clients said , " my whole career was fashion and beauty			1
the nice thing about it is , instead of selling a product , we 're campaigning for a person 's future			2
it spoke to me to give these kids an opportunity to get a foot up on the ladder			1
" @entity65 said his biggest surprise was the " genuineness " in the children 's expression			1
" it 's like they 're saying , ' i 'm a good person inside			2
' they 're dying for an opportunity for someone to step forward and take a chance on them , " he said			0
@entity96 , 14 , who posed next to her portrait at the exhibit , said she loved it			0
" i was shocked at first to see it , but i like it			0
... i feel like a star			0
" @entity103 , founder of @entity12 , says one picture can make all the difference			1
" some of the pictures prospective families typically see of these children -- it 's like looking at a driver 's license photo compared to these photos			1
" an average shoot for the project takes several hours			0
for some of the kids , the shoot provides a mini-family reunion			2
@entity65 said he 's photographed siblings who are living in the system , but not necessarily together			0
" i 've had grandparents , aunts , uncles , show up at my studio so they can have an afternoon together , " he said			0
once the final photographs have been chosen for each kid , giant posters are created to be exhibited for four to six weeks at high - trafficked spots including @entity128 , @entity129 , malls and airports -- places where their curators hope to get many eyes on them			2
along with the exhibit , recruitment and information tables are set up for when people stop and ask , " what are these pictures about ? " @entity103 said			0
@entity142 , 18 , is close to being too old for the foster - care system , but says his poster inspires him			0
" spontaneous , handsome , intelligent , " were words he used to describe his chosen shot			0
" i 'd like to be a star for eternity			0
but for now , i hope to get a family and live my life , " @entity142 said .			2
