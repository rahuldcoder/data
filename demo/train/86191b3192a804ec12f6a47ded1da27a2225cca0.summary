-- while much attention focused on whether @entity3 could delay his retirement by beating fellow former @entity6 champion @entity5 , one of tennis ' quiet achievers slipped into the quarterfinals at @entity9 on tuesday			1
@entity10 has spent much of his career in the shadow of @entity13 , but the 30 - year - old joined his absent compatriot in becoming only the second @entity16 to reach the last eight of all four grand slams in a calendar year since the start of the professional era in 1968			1
" i 'm very happy for that , " the world @entity22 said after overcoming multiple rain delays to beat @entity26 13th seed @entity25 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) 6 - 4			1
" this season is the best of all my career			0
i 'm playing consistent all the year			2
" @entity10 reached the semifinals in @entity32 in 2007 , but had not gone past round four again until now			1
however , he made it to the semifinals at @entity35 in june and also the last eight at january 's @entity37 and @entity38 in july			0
he will next face either eighth seed @entity40 or @entity43 's no. 19 @entity42 , who trailed the @entity44 5 - 2 in the opening set before rain halted their fourth - round match			1
former world @entity49 , who will quit after the tournament , was locked at 6 - 6 with 2009 @entity6 winner @entity5 , having won the first point of the tiebreak when they went off the court			0
the winner of that fourth - round match will face either defending champion @entity58 or @entity61 18th seed @entity59			1
that clash was even less advanced when the weather intervened , with @entity44 second seed djokovic leading 2 - 0 in the opening set as he bids to match @entity10 , @entity66 and @entity67 in having reached at least the quarterfinals of all this season 's slams			1
@entity71 champion @entity66 will take to @entity72 against @entity75 12th seed @entity73 in their last - eight clash when the @entity3 - @entity5 match is over			2
@entity78 will play @entity80 sixth seed @entity81 in wednesday 's evening session , needing just three more wins to clinch a record sixth title in the open era			1
however , the @entity61 will potentially face a semifinal rematch with @entity66 , who he beat in the 2008 final			0
they shared the honors in the two tournaments at @entity38 this year			0
@entity10 , meanwhile , is hoping that his moments of fortune so far will translate into a first grand slam title			2
" i think i have luck in important moments because i was set - points down in the second set ( against @entity25 ) , " he said			0
" the first round with ( @entity100 ) @entity99 i was also three set - points down			2
with ( @entity103 ) @entity102 in the second round also the same			0
so i think in important moments i played good , but of course i had luck			0

@entity10 has now reached quarterfinals of all four tennis grand slams in 2012
he is the second @entity16 to do so in calendar year since start of professional era
@entity10 will next play either eighth seed @entity40 or @entity43 's @entity42
two other fourth - round matches were also halted by rain on tuesday
