-- is it the end of an era for a side recognized as one of the best in football history ? just four players made the squads for all three of @entity12 's @entity11 successes of 2006 , 2009 and 2011 -- and now the first is set to leave in the shape of club captain @entity14			1
on tuesday , the all - action defender -- who turns 36 next month -- announced that he will sever ties at the end of the current season			2
this leaves midfielders @entity21 , @entity22 and goalkeeper @entity23 -- the only one of the quartet to play every minute of all three finals -- as the last bastions of those era - defining teams			2
" after two very serious operations , i 'm finding it very hard to get back to the level i need to be at to stay here , " he told a news conference at @entity12 's training ground			1
" much more than i thought and much more than the surgeons told me			0
that 's why i have made this decision			0
" @entity14 's contract had been set to expire in 2016 but it will now terminate two years early because of the persistent knee trouble the veteran has experienced in recent years			1
having spent seven months out of the game before returning last october , the defender has managed just five league games this season			0
@entity14 , who captained @entity12 to victory in the 2006 and 2009 @entity11 finals , has made 593 appearances for @entity12 , more than any outfield player save for @entity21 's 709			1
@entity21 , who skippered the side in the 2011 after @entity14 was forced to start the game on the bench because of injury , celebrated his 34th birthday in january , although time would be appear to be on the sides of @entity23 , 32 , and @entity22 , 29			0
@entity22 , @entity21 , @entity55 and @entity56 may have lit up @entity12 's play with their sumptuous skills but it 's questionable whether they embodied the @entity12 side during their years of dominance quite like @entity14			1
defying his poodle - style haircut , the defender 's displays were typified by his ' thou - shalt - not - pass ' spirit as he made up for his relatively short stature for a center back ( standing 5ft 10 inches ) with unbridled commitment			2
having made his debut against @entity71 in october 1999 under coach @entity72 , @entity14 spent the first five seasons of his @entity12 career without winning any silverware			2
so what does it say about the versatile defender , who moved to the center after starting out on the right , that this all changed in the very season he was appointed club captain ? on may 14 2005 , @entity12 drew 1 - 1 at @entity84 to win @entity85 for the first time since 1999 -- sparking an avalanche of trophies			1
five more league titles would follow in addition to two @entity92 cups , two @entity91 , two @entity93 and the @entity11 titles			0
success also followed at international level where @entity14 became part of an historic @entity99 side that ended a 44 - year wait for a major trophy when clinching the 2008 @entity102 , before then lifting the @entity103 for the first time in 2010 -- with @entity14 's header having knocked out a dangerous @entity106 in the semifinals			1
as he addressed the media on tuesday , with another club legend -- @entity110 -- a notable attendee , @entity14 explained that he will attempt to finish his @entity12 career with the attitude that has been his hallmark			1
" there are three months of the season left and anyone that knows me will know that i wo n't give up and i 'll keep fighting to the end to try to improve and help the team to achieve its objectives this season , " he was quoted as saying by @entity12 's own website			1
" i do n't know what i 'll do after june 30 , but what i am sure of is that when the season ends i 'm going to need to get some rest			0
i have n't stopped for four years because of injuries			0
after that , we 'll see what happens			0
" @entity14 joined @entity12 's youth team in 1995 and has never played for any other club			1
his onfield successes aside , the @entity133 will also be remembered for his gracious gesture during the @entity137 final at @entity138			0
despite appearing as a late substitute in the 3 - 1 win over @entity142 , the club captain passed up the opportunity to lift the trophy and instead handed the honor to @entity146 , who had had surgery to remove a liver tumor just two months earlier			1
that may well be among the many questions thrown his way at the end of the season , when @entity14 says he will be delighted to reflect on his two decades at one of football 's most distinguished clubs			2
" i 'd like to give a press conference at the end of the season and say farewell to all the people that have accompanied me though these 19 years , " he said			0
" whoever wants to , whoever can -- presidents , directors , coaches , teammates , people from the club , reporters , friends , relatives -- that day i 'll answer whatever questions they want			0
" thank you very much and see you soon ! "			0
