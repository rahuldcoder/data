@entity0 -- getting a deal done on the government shutdown was ugly , divisive and controversial			0
and it has left a few people missing pork			2
days after @entity8 kept their @entity10 majority in the 2012 election , speaker @entity7 doubled down on a ban on earmarks -- those legislative nuggets that get embedded into bigger bills directing funds to specific pet projects			1
these legislative provisions were generally the grease that made @entity20 go -- leadership in the @entity10 and @entity22 would add earmarks to bills as a way to win votes on a larger controversial proposal			1
the " earmark ban shows the @entity30 people we are listening , " @entity7 said in 2012			0
" we are dead serious about ending business as usual in @entity0			0
" but with that announcement , @entity7 was tying one hand -- a hand that many of his predecessors had used before -- behind his back			0
he would have to pass legislation without the ability to woo members with money for their districts			0
" trying to be a leader where you have no sticks and very few carrots is dang near impossible , " @entity43 , former @entity45 senate majority leader and @entity46 told @entity1			1
" members do n't get anything from you and leaders do n't give anything			1
they do n't feel like you can reward them or punish them			2
" @entity43 , who is now a senior fellow at the @entity59 , said @entity7 's job during this recent shutdown and debt ceiling crisis would " absolutely " have been easier had he been able to use earmarks			1
" when i was the whip in the @entity10 in the 80s , i had a shop window hours when members could come in and say they had a problem and ask for help , " @entity43 said			1
" then when i came to do my whip job , the members " were more receptive to support him			0
@entity43 , however , operated in a different @entity8			2
" bringing home the bacon " back then was seen as a good thing , where today , many tea party and conservative @entity8 campaigned on the idea that earmarks represented the seedy , pay - to - play deals of @entity43 's @entity20			1
even in wednesday 's @entity22 deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling there was a little pork			2
the spending bill added more than $ 2 billion for a system of locks under construction at the confluence of the @entity89 and @entity90 rivers and between @entity91 and @entity92			2
senate minority leader @entity93 has received some blow back for the money , but @entity97 and @entity45 leaders say @entity98 did not ask for it			1
" i find it funny that people keep coming back to this , " said @entity100 , vice president of @entity101 , a group that has been vocally supportive of the earmarks ban			2
" i do n't think earmarks are this sort of panacea that would make the trains all run on time			1
" the group has put out different research on earmarks , backing up @entity7 's ban and pointing out some of the more earmark - laden bills of the past 20 years			1
@entity100 says it is " preposterous " to assume that conservative members of @entity20 who ran against @entity0 spending could be " bought off " with earmarks			1
" if you are willing to shutdown the government over the issue of @entity125 , " why would a road project in your district change your mind , he said			0
earmarks , while something long used in congressional spending bills , grew significantly between the presidencies of @entity130 and @entity131			1
in 1996 , the defense appropriation bill included 270 earmarks			2
in 2005 , there were 2,506 earmarks in the defense spending bill , costing taxpayers over $ 9 billion			2
for other bills , like the energy and water development appropriation , earmarks made up 24.8 % of the money spent in 1994 and 30.3 % in 2002			2
proponents of earmarking will argue that the small amount of money they cost is a price worth paying to make government run more smoothly			0
opponents , however , say earmarks are what lead to massively expensive appropriation bills , making them more difficult to pass			1
earmarks have also caused @entity20 -- and specific members -- a number of public relations headaches			1
some of the projects earmarks have funded are laughable and make for comedic fodder			1
* in 2010 , $ 1.8 million was approved for the @entity160 @entity159 , a museum to neon , as part of the @entity163			0
* in 2009 , @entity97 rep. @entity164 of @entity0 backed a $ 250,000 earmark for window repair and limestone sill replacement at " the @entity168 " -- a high society club in @entity170			0
* then there was the 2005 " @entity172 , " a project in @entity174 slated to cost nearly $ 400 million that was secured with an earmark by rep. @entity177 and the late sen. @entity178			0
it became a notorious illustration of pork - barrel spending and was never built			1
* another infamous pet project line item was some $ 450,000 in 2005 to the @entity183 , which was responsible for the @entity184 in @entity185			0
the money was eventually returned to the government			0
" they are a tool , " said former @entity97 rep. @entity188 of @entity189			0
" for years they were an overused tool and now they are an absolutely underused tool			0
there has got to be something in between			0
" @entity43 acknowledged that , at times , earmarks got out of hand and needed to be reformed			1
but that does n't mean , he said , they should have been outlawed all together			0
" there needs to be a defined process , " he said			0
as for whether his support of earmarks opens him to criticism from other @entity8 , @entity43 laughs			1
" some of them may say you sound like a rino , " @entity43 said , using the acronym for " @entity45			2
" look , i was conservative before many of these turkeys were born			0

former congressional leaders say earmarks could remedy @entity20 *dysfunction*
earmarks - or pork spending - are nuggets embedded into large bills for pet projects
former senate majority leader @entity43 says " no sticks and very few carrots " make it hard to lead
some tax groups say earmarks would n't have helped with tea party in the latest *showdown*
