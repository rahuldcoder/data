@entity0 , @entity1 -- the only thing that seemed to frighten @entity4 that dark morning was that a guilty conscience would haunt him if he did nothing			1
he 'd been a fisherman all his life and was familiar with the fury of the sea			2
still , he chose to sail into the oncoming tsunami , sacrificing his own life so others could live			2
@entity14 sits on a riverbank , perching on the side of a 15 - foot wooden boat like her husband 's			1
it 's a struggle to hear her small voice above the sound of waves rolling over the pebbles			1
" my husband always said to me that if @entity25 took him before his time , that he hoped it would be doing something for his town and his people , " @entity14 said			1
@entity14 had been camping with her 54 - year - old husband , her 20 - year - old son , @entity33 , and family friend @entity34 on an island in the @entity36			1
the island is a few hundred yards from the ocean and closer still to the town of @entity0			1
it was a tradition here to camp out on the island in the closing days of the @entity43 's summer			1
the family was asleep , and scores more were camping nearby when they were awakened by the massive quake about 3.30 a.m. local time february 27			1
@entity48 took one look as the river began to rapidly ebb and knew that a tsunami was on its way			1
" @entity53 and my son dragged the boat down to the water line and shouted ' women and children first ! ' i ran to get everybody together			1
but the boat was too small , and there was not enough space for everybody , " @entity14 explained			1
@entity14 refused a spot on the first boat			1
she , her son and @entity67 helped load four women and their six young children aboard			2
a first wave came rolling in , and @entity48 ferried the first group out of harm 's way			1
he shouted that he would be back			2
just before the second wave hit , @entity48 sailed the 400 - yard round trip and departed the island a second time , taking his wife and nine others			1
his stepson and friend stayed behind to organize the others still stranded			0
@entity82 was running out as the tsunami waters rose			0
" as i looked back , i heard screams and laments , " @entity14 said			0
" i shouted to my son @entity86 to run to the trees and climb up			0
he shouted back , ' i 'm ok , @entity88			0
never forget i love you			0
' " witnesses say @entity48 saved at least 20 people in two trips			1
his wife begged him not to go back and instead head for higher ground			0
but a neighbor appeared and begged @entity48 to make a third and final trip			1
" he said , do n't worry , he 'd be back			2
but he said , if he did n't make it , then that 's @entity98 , " @entity14 said			1
" he said if he did n't try to rescue more people , then he 'd always have it on his conscience			1
" those were @entity48 's last words to his wife			2
she waited for him by a bridge until the water levels forced her to flee to high ground			0
" i heard the third wave coming and destroying everything in its path			0
i heard ships ' moorings snap			0
i ran up the hill , and when i looked back , i realized @entity53 , @entity86 and @entity34 were gone			0
i knew i 'd never see them again			0
inhabitants of @entity0 found @entity48 's body six days later			2
he had been dragged 5 kilometers ( about 3 miles ) into the thick forests that line the banks of the @entity36			0
debris and bits of houses litter the forests			0
three fishing boats , each about 70 tons , lie battered and beached there , too			0
a short bit away , the digging arm of a bright yellow backhoe can be seen jutting out of the water			0
on the opposite side of the river , the back of a cement truck rises just above the water level			2
if the tsunami has destroyed those objects , each weighing many tons , one ca n't even begin to imagine how @entity4 must have battled to keep his 15 - foot skiff on course			1
there 's no record of the names of the 20 women and children whom witnesses say @entity48 saved that morning			1
events unfolded too fast , and the situation was too desperate to make a note			2
the tsunami has wiped out most of @entity14 's physical reminders of her marriage to @entity48 , too			2
she clutches just three damp photos she rescued from the sludge			0
but she will never forget			0
" i always knew @entity53 was a hero			0
now , the memories are in my heart , " she said .			0

@entity4 was camping on island in river when earthquake struck
