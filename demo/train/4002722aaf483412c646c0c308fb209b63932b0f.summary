-- @entity1 , the @entity3 - @entity2 architect responsible for the @entity5 's redevelopment , says his favorite building is the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9			1
originally an armory for @entity13 and subsequently under @entity14 and @entity16 control , the @entity11 's main military museum survived the 1945 bombing of @entity8 due to its location on the city 's outskirts			1
" it is an interesting project for me , " says @entity1 , " because now it is a museum of modern democratic @entity9			2
how to transform it ? how to create a new sense of what it means to have a military in a democracy which is controlled by the citizens ? " in @entity1 's $ 85 million redesign , completed in 2011 , a huge wedge of concrete and steel scythes through the stone , columned building , to create something he describes as " both disruptive of the old , but [ that ] also gives you a sense of how we have changed our thinking			1
" watch great buildings on @entity0 's @entity43 born in @entity3 , raised under communist regimes and the child of @entity47 survivors , @entity1 says the concept underpinning his design " was n't something that i had to research in libraries			1
" the dramatic shard , which was constructed as the building was also being restored , helps to reorient the museum 's purpose			2
@entity1 says the new space offers visitors a chance to question " why people participate in and organize violence , why they conform to totalitarian thoughts			1
" view a hi - res gallery of @entity65 's ' @entity64 ' " this space is not for weapons			1
it 's to navigate between the horizontal world of history and the vertical world of human aspiration and understanding			2
" " i wanted people to feel that sense of displacement , that space of catastrophe , " he says			0
" it 's not just about weapons and rockets and tanks , it 's about people 's decisions , and how people view the world			1
" the building @entity1 most wishes he 'd designed is one completely at odds with its surrounds -- the @entity94 , which looms over @entity95 ' uniformly mid-rise cityscape			1
" it 's a building with no function , that has no program , " @entity1 says			1
" it 's completely uncharacteristic of @entity95 , and yet it 's such a fantastic building			1
today it 's one of the world 's most recognizable and most - visited monuments but in its day , the tower , erected for the @entity106 , was a controversial emblem of industrialization			2
@entity1 admires the daring of its design , which was innovative for its time , and the risks its engineers took -- " the technology had never really been used			2
there is no guarantee how it would work , " he notes -- but he also admires its poetry			0
" it does n't mimic anything			0
it has a spirit to it , a spirit of the unknown			0
and when you go see it , you still wonder , what the hell is this thing ? how was it built ? " " that defines for me what good architecture is : it 's not a formula			0
it 's not the pretty facade of the building			2
it 's how the building transforms the city			0
it 's changed how people view @entity95			1
" " all the great artists , composers and politicians hated that building			0
they wanted to tear it down			0
they thought it was the ugliest , stupidest thing			0
but , in the long run , it became the most beloved and most symbolic building of @entity156 , of @entity95 , of @entity157			2
" @entity1 's @entity8 museum was also criticized but , he says , he never doubted it			1
" once you hit on the right idea , it 's not a matter of compromising			0
of course , you have to be flexible to work it out , but the big idea has to be so strong , it has to go through fire and still emerge exactly how you wanted it to be			0
" " if people enjoy it , the building becomes part of the city , and then people have a different idea of the city			0
it can have a big role in changing what the world looks like to us			0

@entity1 's redesign of the @entity7 in @entity8 is his favorite work to date
" it 's not just about weapons and rockets *...* it 's about people 's decisions and how people view the world , " @entity1 says
@entity3 - born architect wishes he had designed the @entity94 , in @entity95
" it 's completely uncharacteristic of @entity95 , and yet it 's such a fantastic building , " he says
