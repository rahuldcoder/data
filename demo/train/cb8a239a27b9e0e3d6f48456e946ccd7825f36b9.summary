-- a federal judge on monday blocked implementation of a law that would have mandated tobacco companies include on cigarette packages graphic pictures and messages showing the dangers of smoking			1
" this case poses a constitutional challenge to a bold new tact ( sic ) by the @entity19 , and the @entity20 , in their obvious and continuing efforts to minimize , if not eradicate , tobacco use in the @entity11 , " concluded @entity11 district judge @entity10 , who cited first amendment rights against unconstitutionally compelled speech as a factor in his 29 - page decision			1
" notwithstanding the potential legal and financial ramifications of this challenge , the government , for reasons known only to itself , is unwilling to voluntarily stay the effective date of this rule until the @entity31 can appropriately review the constitutionality of the government 's novel -- and costly -- approach to regulating tobacco packaging and advertising			2
thus , this court must -- and will -- act to preserve the status quo until it can evaluate , on the merits ( and without incurring irreparable harm to those companies genuinely affected ) , the constitutionality of the commercial speech that these graphic images compel , " @entity10 wrote in his decision			1
gallery : see the cigarette labels he said the tobacco companies had shown : a substantial likelihood of success ; that allowing the labeling requirements to proceed would cause them to " suffer irreparable harm " ; that " neither the government , nor the public , will suffer any comparable injury as a result of the relief sought " ; and that the public 's " interest in the protection of its first amendment rights against unconstitutionally compelled speech would be furthered			1
" the 36 proposed images include a man exhaling smoke through a hole in his throat ; diseased lungs next to healthy lungs ; a mouth bearing what appear to be cancerous lesions ; a bare - chested male cadaver with chest staples down his torso			2
opinion : can scary labels , taxes end smoking ? @entity10 noted that the some of the pictures appeared to have been digitally enhanced or manipulated to make them " evoke emotion " and are not therefore " purely factual , " as the government had asserted			0
though @entity19 mandated the images fill the top half of the front and back of cigarette packages , @entity10 said the dimensions suggest it was trying to turn cigarettes into mini-billboards intended not to impart information about smoking but " to advocate a change in consumer behavior			0
" in a statement , @entity96 , the president of @entity97 , called the decision " wrong on the science and wrong on the law " and called for the @entity102 to appeal			0
" if allowed to stand , this ruling would make it impossible to implement any effective warning labels , " he said , adding that @entity10 's ruling " ignores the overwhelming scientific evidence about the need for the new cigarette warnings and their effectiveness " and ignores @entity109 precedent that supports the right of the government to require warning labels to protect public health			0
@entity96 noted that studies have shown that such graphic warnings are effective at " informing consumers about the health risks of smoking , discouraging children and other nonsmokers from starting to smoke , and motivating smokers to quit			0
" @entity20 reveals bigger , graphic warning labels for cigarette packages at least 43 other countries require such cigarette box warnings , he said			0
the law on the labels was to have kicked in beginning next september			0
" they serve the compelling goal of reducing the death and disease caused by tobacco use , which kills more than 400,000 @entity11 and costs the nation $ 96 billion in health care expenditures each year , " @entity96 said			1
@entity139 , a professor at @entity140 and head of the @entity142 , said the case may not be resolved for years , and the matter is an urgent one			1
" even a relatively modest percentage improvement or a percentage reduction in initiation or continued use will potentially save tens of thousands of lives per year , " he said .			2
