-- at least 510 people were killed in @entity2 , @entity3 , in december , giving support to a recent report that called the city the murder capital of the world			1
a chalk message reads no more murders as a student protests killings in @entity2 in this file photo			1
it 's against that backdrop that the country 's minister for @entity17 announced efforts this week to combat crime in 2009			1
minister @entity20 said monday he will form 50 community police units in @entity2 and take other measures so that " we can have in a short time a culture of peace , tranquility and calm for all the @entity3 public			1
" by all accounts , it will be a tall order			0
@entity31 said in september that @entity2 tops the list of five murder capitals of the world , with an official tally of 130 homicides per 100,000 residents			1
the city , which is @entity3 's capital , has about 4 million inhabitants			1
@entity31 is owned by the @entity40 and published by the @entity41			1
the @entity42 made the magazine 's top five , too , with @entity45 , @entity46 coming in at no. 3			1
its murder rate is estimated as 67 per 100,000 by its police department and 95 per 100,000 by the @entity51			1
still , the rate in @entity2 comes in far ahead of the following four murderous capitals			2
" @entity2 has become far more dangerous in recent years than any @entity56 city , even beating out the once notorious @entity57 , [ @entity58 ] , " @entity54 said			2
" what 's worse , the city 's official homicide statistics likely fall short of the mark because they omit prison - related murders as well as deaths that the state never gets around to properly ' categorizing			1
' " the numbers also do n't count those who died while ' resisting arrest , ' suggesting that @entity2 ' cops -- already known for their brutality against student protesters -- might be cooking the books , " the magazine said			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity74 reported this week that officials reported 510 killings in @entity2 this month , capping a particularly brutal year			2
" it 's shocking , " said @entity77 , director of @entity78 at the @entity79 in @entity80			2
" it 's the biggest concern of the population -- crime and security			2
" @entity86 , a political science professor at @entity88 de @entity87 in @entity2 for 25 years , has seen that crime up close			1
" violence is the major problem for @entity3 , according to any source you use , " @entity86 told @entity0 on tuesday			1
" it 's doubly sad because , primarily , the deaths occur almost exclusively in the poor sectors , and , secondarily , it 's among youth under 30 years old			2
" @entity77 points out that the killings are " basically poor on poor			2
" from the 1970s to the 1990s , the poverty rate nearly tripled , from 25 percent to 65 percent , @entity77 said			0
even though the poverty rate declined during the oil boom that started in the 1990s , she said , the rate remains high			0
" it 's a combination of economic - driven crime ... with other types of gangs , to police abuse , " @entity77 said			1
" the police are not properly trained and not properly equipped			2
" anti-crime efforts in @entity2 also suffered , she said , when the national government took over the city 's police force in 2002			1
" there has been trouble getting the police force back to par , " she said			0
@entity86 said he doubts the anti-crime measures @entity118 announced monday will work			0
" you ca n't resolve this problem with police , " @entity86 said			0
" the government is co-responsible for there being so many firearms			0
there is no good gun control , there are no permits and there is no good control over the militias			0
" the problem , @entity86 and @entity77 said , transcends the drug trade and gang battles			0
" you do n't have the guerrilla problems , " @entity77 said			0
" you do n't have drug cartels			0
you do n't have a large mafia			0
" @entity86 lays much of the blame on the 10 - year - old government of socialist president @entity142			0
" the government discourse , " he said , " is that if you are lacking something it is because of injustice			0
then look for it , take it away from those who have it			0
you can obtain justice with your own hands			0
" the magazine lists , in descending order , @entity2 ; @entity155 , @entity156 ; @entity45 ; @entity157 , @entity158 ; and @entity159 , @entity160 , as the top five murder capitals in the world .			1

@entity31 names @entity2 , @entity3 , the murder capital of the world
@entity3 to step up efforts to fight crime in @entity2 in 2009
violence is gang - and police - related , and often poor on poor
@entity45 , @entity46 , comes in third on magazine 's list of top five
