-- a theater company from @entity2 is translating @entity3 into the local dialect for the first time , before performing the play at @entity8 's @entity7			1
six months after the birth of @entity2 as an independent nation , it is a country still trying to define its culture and national identity			0
the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) is helping to develop that culture by performing @entity3 's tragedy " @entity17 " in @entity18 -- a language spoken widely in @entity2			1
" @entity3 is a genius writer who wrote about humanity , about greed , jealousy , wars , power , love -- he really speaks to the whole world , " said @entity20 , the @entity14 's director and producer			1
" we want to do @entity17 in a way that speaks to the @entity2 -- in terms of the plot , the kind of conflict that exists here -- and make it our own thing , " he added			0
@entity18 is a pidgin form of @entity18 that takes its name from the @entity2 capital of @entity18			2
although @entity41 has been named @entity2 's official language since the country 's independence , @entity18 is still a lingua franca in much of @entity2 , says @entity20			1
the @entity14 's production is part of the " @entity48 taking place at @entity8 's @entity7 from april			1
the @entity14 will be one of 37 theater groups from around the world performing interpretations of @entity3 plays in their local language			1
the @entity14 has already begun adapting @entity17 and translating it			0
" we 're looking to cut out unnecessary bits so that 10 actors can do it , instead of perhaps 18 , " said @entity20			0
" we 're looking to have a simplified , shortened text that can be performed in one and a half hours instead of three			0
" actors will be drawn from two of @entity2 's established theater groups , the @entity64 and the @entity65 , and will include graduates of the @entity67 's @entity68			1
@entity20 says they plan to perform @entity17 in @entity18 before taking it to @entity8 in may			1
they are are also looking to make changes to the original to make it more relevant to local audiences , such as using local names and costumes			0
the original @entity17 is set against a backdrop of impending war between ancient @entity80 and ancient @entity81 , over the king of @entity80 's refusal to pay tribute to @entity81 ; the @entity14 is considering changing that to an impending conflict between south and north @entity2 , fighting over oil			1
@entity2 's real civil war between north and south raged for decades , claiming more than two million lives			1
but @entity20 says theater survived those dark years of conflict			2

" @entity96 never stopped people coming together through arts -- whether music or drama or dance , " he added			0
and he believes theater can help build @entity2 , celebrating the fledgling nation 's cultural diversity			2
" it is a very cheap art form compared to cinema and tv -- you can do it anywhere -- move it to the villages and contribute to their understanding of their environment , their struggles , you can do it in schools and teach young people how to do the right thing			0
" through theater we can send a lot of messages about unity , about respecting people , about coming together , about tolerance and civilization			0
he added : " there is an old saying -- ' give me a theater and i will give you a nation			0
' " as casting and rehearsals begin , @entity20 is excited at the prospect of performing in @entity8			0
" i have been to @entity8 several times			0
it is a land of theater , a land that produced a giant like @entity3 , " he said			2
" to be in @entity8 with a @entity144 play , when we 're a country that will be nine months old at the time , it 's a great thing			2
