president @entity0 may not be a welcome sight on the campaign trail for democrats in many key @entity5 races , but the first lady is a different story			1
@entity0 made her campaign trail debut monday in the hotly contested @entity10 race for the @entity5			1
she headlined a fundraiser and a voter registration rally for @entity14 candidate @entity13 , among other @entity14 candidates up for election in the @entity10			1
" the stakes this year could n't be higher			0
if we do n't show up in the polls this november , if we do n't elect leaders in @entity24 and here in @entity10 who put people first instead of fighting for special interests , we know exactly what will happen , " the first lady told an energized crowd , before going on to outline the familiar @entity14 attack lines heard in the past two election cycles			1
" we will see more folks interfering in women 's private decisions about our health care			0
we 'll see more folks denying that climate change even exists			0
we 'll see more votes against equal pay and immigration reform and raising " the minimum wage			0

the speech , which lasted less than a half an hour , was briefly interrupted when a female student fainted , but the interruption was a short one			0
@entity0 paused , called for a medic to attend to the student , and continued with her remarks			1
the @entity60 race , an open contest as a result of the retirement of sen. @entity64 , is a marquee contest of the 2014 cycle			2
the race is a sort of " who 's who " of @entity10 political families pitting @entity13 , a nonprofit ceo and daughter of former @entity10 sen. @entity72 , against @entity74 candidate @entity73 , a businessman and cousin of former @entity10 gov. @entity76			1
@entity13 campaign defends early campaign memo @entity14 see the contest as one of their best chances to pick up a @entity5 seat from @entity74 in a midterm cycle where the party is primarily playing defense across the country			1
winning that seat would greatly increase the @entity14 ' chance of keeping control of the upper chamber			2
high stakes in a tight political contest in @entity10 , @entity0 appeared to take a do - no - harm approach , staying away from controversial current events , focusing her remarks instead on the importance of registering to vote and turning out at the polls			1
" @entity98 won because record numbers of women and minorities and young people showed up to vote , " she said			0
" but then , when the midterms come along , too many people , of our folks , just tuned out			0
see , that 's what happens in the midterms , " the first lady continued			2
" when you stay home , they win			0
" @entity13 , who spoke ahead of the first lady at monday 's event , is the former ceo of the nonpartisan organization @entity116 , a charity whose title is derived from the " thousand points of light " theme that @entity121 spoke about frequently			1
president @entity121 fights for @entity60 seat she is considered to be one of the @entity14 ' two best possibilities for a pickup from the @entity74			2
the other candidate considered to have a solid chance for a seat pick - up is @entity129 , who is challenging @entity5 minority leader @entity130 in @entity131			1
@entity74 senatorial candidate @entity73 has tied @entity13 to the unpopular president @entity0 , arguing that once in @entity133 she would support the president 's agenda entirely			1
a @entity138 / @entity137 poll released on monday showed @entity140 percentage points behind @entity73 , 47 % to 41 %			1
currently , @entity14 hold a five - seat majority in the @entity5 , and @entity14 are up for re-election in seven states that went red in the 2012 presidential election , in addition to facing tough contests in places like @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			1
the math is on the @entity74 's side , making @entity10 's @entity5 contest that much more important for the @entity14			1
in her remarks , the first lady argued that if @entity74 were to regain control of the senate in november , gridlock in @entity133 would get even worse			0
" frankly , if we lose these midterm elections , it 's going to be a whole lot harder to finish what we started , " she said , referring to the @entity0 administration 's agenda			1
" because things will be even worse out of @entity133			0
" a popular first lady although her husband 's popularity is not great -- the most recent polling from @entity171 / @entity170 shows his approval rating at 43 % -- @entity0 still enjoys high approval ratings			1

game on in pivotal @entity60 race @entity0 has mostly stayed away from public events on the campaign trail this cycle , though she has done @entity14 fundraisers			1
it remains to be seen whether these types of appearances will become more frequent in the coming weeks and months ahead of the midterm elections in november			0
