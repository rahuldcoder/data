@entity0 -- president @entity2 turned in a less - than - stellar performance wednesday night in his first debate this election season			1
on thursday , his campaign aides said former @entity8 gov. @entity7 came armed with distortions			0
but if the president believed that , he barely brought them to the viewers ' attention during the debate			1
instead , he turned in a distracted , passionless performance			2
here are five reasons he fumbled : 1			0
his nice - guy image : the @entity2 team believes the president 's biggest asset is his likability			1
they want him to preserve that at all costs			0
they 're convinced undecided voters do n't want to see him engaged in verbal combat -- so he rose above it			2
that meant he passed on openings to attack @entity7			0
he also missed openings to defend his own record and did n't challenge what his campaign now labels @entity7 " distortions			2
" it let him stay the nice guy , but is n't there a saying about the nice guy and where he finishes ? 2			1
misjudging the room : they decided this was n't about the debate			1
instead , it was an opportunity , like the speech at the @entity51 , to speak directly " to voters at home , not the people in the room			0
" viewers saw that tactic a few times when the president looked directly into the camera to deliver his message			2
but a debate is about engaging with at least two people in the room -- the opponent ( @entity7 ) and the moderator ( @entity66 )			0
by reaching beyond them ( and at one point snapping at @entity70 ) , the president seemed disengaged and disinterested -- and no doubt that matters to the people watching at home			0
not enough prep : the president held more strategy sessions about the debate than actual mock debates			1
it 's no doubt harder to find the time to prep when you 're a sitting president and not a candidate , but to get rehired , he needs to find the time			1
known for his gift with words , the president is , according to sources , challenging to coach			0
he believes he 's his own best critic and that he knows what to say and how to say it			0
incumbency syndrome : did you get the sense the president did not want to be on that stage , that other things were on his mind ? he appeared impatient with the experience , not unlike other incumbent presidents , including @entity104 2004			0
it read almost as if the president is dealing with too many other domestic and global issues to stand there and volley about campaign promises when he has -- in the mind of the incumbent -- more pressing matters			0
he seemed to have a bad case of it wednesday night			0
does n't take criticism well : it 's no secret @entity2 is a confident man			1
he would n't have a lot of patience for advisers talking about how to score style points			2
but as @entity122 's sighing debate performance in 2000 proved how a candidate looks when he 's not speaking can be as important as what he says			1
sources tell @entity1 that during debate prep , only the president 's inner circle stayed for the critique of the president 's performance after the mock debates			1
even then , it did n't seem to make enough headway to calm the president 's impatience with this process			1
maybe next time , they 'll show the president tape of his downward gaze and grimacing during @entity7 's answers -- and let him provide his own self - criticism before he shows up in @entity144 , @entity145 , for the second debate at @entity147			1
three things we know about the president : he 's fiercely competitive , hates losing and he is disciplined			2
after last night 's experience , he will no doubt adjust and come in ready with a different performance for round two			2
but he has to avoid the problem @entity122 faced in 2000			0
@entity122 was too passive in one debate so he overcorrected and came off as too aggressive in another -- missing the mark both times			0
day after : @entity2 accuses @entity7 of dishonesty in debate can @entity2 recover , or will @entity7 step it up ? analysis : @entity7 seizes the story five things we learned from the first debate			1

@entity1 's @entity168 analyzes president @entity2 's debate performance
@entity2 's team had him cling too hard to his nice - guy image , @entity168 observes
@entity168 also points out the president did n't engage in enough debate prep
finally , the president does n't take criticism well , and that hurt him , @entity168 says
