-- two idyllic @entity2 islands are facing a water crisis ; they 're running out of it , and fast			1
the island nations @entity6 and @entity7 have declared states of emergency after six months of little or no rainfall			1
it 's estimated that at the current rate of consumption the @entity6 atoll of @entity13 , home to 5,000 people , will run out of drinking water in two weeks			1
@entity7 , a territory of @entity20 with a population of 1,500 , could run dry in just one			1
" we are all working in line with the fact that we recognize this national emergency situation , " @entity22 , the general manager of the @entity7 government told @entity24			1
the @entity20 @entity29 flew emergency supplies to @entity6 monday on a @entity20 defense force flight along with two aid workers and two foreign ministry staff			1
" we have mobilized 2,000 collapsible water containers , hand sanitizers , tarpaulins to be used to capture rain ( and ) two emergency desalination units , " @entity34 , @entity20 @entity35 and emergency manager said in a statement tuesday			2
the emergency desalinators are being sent south on a patrol boat at midnight tuesday to the small atoll of @entity46 , part of @entity6 , whose population of 330 is reported to be down to its last 60 liters of water			1
schools have closed as residents conserve what little water they have and pray for rain			2
" it 's a pretty dire situation there , " @entity57 , @entity20 high commissioner to @entity6 told @entity24			1
@entity57 is one of the two foreign ministry staff sent to @entity6 this week			1
in @entity46 , water is being rationed			2
families - some with as many as 10 people - are forced to live on just 40 liters a day , according to @entity63 , a water management adviser from the @entity66 and @entity65 of @entity67			2
" families are getting by washing in the sea and only having a short wash in fresh water if at all , " he said , adding that most of the fresh water is being reserved for drinking and cooking			1
the @entity6 government briefed a group known as the " @entity78 " tuesday in the @entity80 capital of @entity81 on the type of aid that might be needed			1
delegates included head of foreign missions , international agencies and regional organizations			0
parts for desalination units and fuel top the list , @entity63 said			0
@entity6 , the world 's fourth smallest country , is a nation of four reef islands and five atolls covering 26 square kilometers in the @entity2 halfway between @entity96 and @entity97			1
the island nation relies almost exclusively on rainwater collected from the roofs of homes and government buildings to supply a population of 10,000			2
however , three dry spells over the last three years has gradually drained the community 's water supplies			1
" communities in @entity6 are pretty used to doing it tough , " @entity63 said			2
" atoll environments are really hard environments to live in and when you 're just relying on rainfall for all of your water , you find yourself in situations where you do need to make the most of every small amount			0
" for these communities to be asking for external assistance , it shows that the situation is quite serious , " he said			0
@entity20 's foreign affairs minister @entity120 has warned the water crisis could lead to food shortages as crops fail			0
" we 're now doing an assessment , not just in @entity6 but also in other areas of the @entity2 that are affected by the shortage of rainfall , making sure we deal with the drinking water issue most urgently , " he told @entity24			1
@entity6 imports the bulk of its food but its people also grow their own crops , mostly taro			2
the root vegetable is grown in pits filled with organic matter due to the lack of soil available on the atoll			0
" we know that on some of the islands , particularly on @entity143 , many pits are suffering damage from either drying out or getting saline from the water table			0
so there 's certainly an impact on food security , " @entity63 said			0
" we 're even finding that some fruit trees are suffering , even coconuts , which is unusual			0
coconut palms on @entity143 are starting to lose their fronds , " he said			0
@entity6 has been very vocal in its calls for international help to mitigate the effects of climate change			2
it has warned that it is in danger of " sinking " as sea water levels rise			0
" the information we have about climate change and rainfall patterns is getting better and better every month , " @entity63 said			0
however he added that assessing long term trends on the islands was difficult to due the lack of rain gauges			0
" one thing 's for sure , water will be the main mechanism by which climate change impacts on these island communities , whether it be by droughts or by storms or floods , " he said			0
" so building their resistance to today 's climate variability that they 're experiencing will be a key defense they can employ against the future impacts of climate change , and i think people are recognizing that			0
