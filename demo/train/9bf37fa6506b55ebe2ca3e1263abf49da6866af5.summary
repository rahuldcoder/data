-- it took @entity2 two years , two group stages and a full 18 games to get to the brink of their first ever @entity7 finals			1
the country had reached fever pitch , salivating at the prospect of their small @entity12 kingdom securing a place in @entity15 alongside the world 's best soccer - playing nations			1
standing in their way were @entity21 , 1950 @entity7 winners and ranked as the sixth best team on the planet , brimming with world class talent like @entity27 's @entity26 and @entity29 's @entity28			1
but though the team known as ' @entity32 ' , which translates as ' @entity33 ' , battled gamely in the first leg of their playoff in front of their reigning monarch @entity37 , the dream is all but over			0
@entity21 ran out 5 - 0 winners in @entity40 , delighting their small pocket of fans who made the journey from @entity44 , meaning the mother of all footballing miracles will be needed if @entity2 are to qualify			1
still , a portion of their deflated supporters stayed behind after the final whistle to applaud the opposition , whose superior quality told in goals from @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity28			0
@entity2 started well , @entity59 nearly sneaking a shot inside the near post of @entity21 goalkeeper @entity62 , but the home side were soon on the back foot			0
the deadlock was broken on 22 minutes when @entity55 , who plays in @entity66 for @entity67 , tapped home from close range after @entity28 's header had been parried by @entity2 goalkeeper @entity71			1
the second was n't far behind as @entity56 steered a low shot into the net after poor defending allowed a cross to fall to the striker , who plys his club trade for @entity78 in @entity79			0
after the interval , @entity2 fashioned their best chance of the game but @entity84 missed the target from close range after @entity88 's inviting cross			0
@entity57 made it three on 69 minutes , sweeping home after good work from @entity28 and @entity58 grabbed a fourth moments later with a crisp volley from inside the area			0
@entity2 's misery was complete in time added on as @entity28 got the goal his performance warranted , arrowing a free kick from 25 yards into the top corner			1
the return leg is in @entity102 next wednesday but @entity2 will travel to @entity44 in the knowledge that their first @entity7 appearance is set to elude them again			2
@entity107 joy @entity107 are odds on to join @entity21 in @entity15 after they took a commanding 5 - 1 lead in their playoff with @entity111			1
there was a real fear among the country 's football mad fans that @entity107 might miss out on the @entity7 for the first time since 1990 , and they had to rely on other results going their way even to make the playoffs			2
coach @entity121 was their fourth in five qualification matches but his decision to overlook star names like @entity128 's @entity127 in favor of those who play in @entity107 's domestic league paid off			0
two goals from @entity133 and further strikes from @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 put @entity107 into a five - goal lead before @entity139 grabbed a consolation goal for the @entity111			2
the return leg takes place in @entity111 next tuesday .			0

@entity21 thrash @entity2 5 - 0 in their @entity7 qualification playoff first leg
class tells for world 's sixth best team against @entity151 *minnows*
