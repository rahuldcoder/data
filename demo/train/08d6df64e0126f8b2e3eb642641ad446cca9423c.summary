@entity0 -- this @entity2 , enjoy the turkey and roast beef			0
but do yourself a favor , and skip the duck			0
this whole controversy over @entity10 's hit show " @entity11 " is whacked			1
better make that " quacked			0
" first , the network puts @entity13 , the family patriarch , on indefinite suspension for making insensitive remarks in a magazine interview			1
then , the rest of the family rallies around their leader and suggests that the hit show will not go on without him			2
as you probably know unless you 've spent the last couple of weeks crouching in a duck blind , @entity13 -- in paraphrasing a @entity26 verse -- appeared to liken homosexuality to bestiality and used crude language to describe his own sexual preference			1
in speaking to @entity33 , he also seemed to minimize the discrimination that @entity36 - @entity35 suffered in the @entity37 before the civil rights movement			0
criticism of @entity13 poured in , but so did support for one 's right to express oneself			1
the patriarch responded : " i would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different than me			0
" in fact , @entity13 claims he and his family are the ones who have been treated disrespectfully -- by the producers of the show , and the entertainment industry in general			1
in an interview two months ago with the @entity56 , @entity13 said that television editors in @entity58 " with no moral compass " have routinely manipulated the show 's footage to intensify the language and make the family appear more profane and unruly than they really are			1
" they inserted fake beeps like somebody had used profanity , but no one had used profanity			0
if you want that , you can get all of that you want , " @entity13 continued			1
" just turn the station			0
there 's plenty of that ! and if we 're not using profanity , why make it look like we 're using profanity ? what is the point ? why do n't you just run it and say what we say ? " eventually , he said , producers gave in and " quit doing that			2
" according to @entity13 , the editors also took out the phrase " in @entity90 ' name " when the family prayed			1
it makes you wonder exactly how much reality is behind some of these reality shows			2
and now , it looks like the whole spectacle of @entity13 being taken to the woodshed by the network could be part of the show			1
according to @entity102 , @entity10 will -- starting january 15 -- air new episodes of the show that will include scenes featuring @entity13			1
these new episodes were already in the can			0
still , if @entity10 is sincere in its outrage over what @entity13 said , then it should stop trying to profit from the show he helped make successful			1
@entity113 , senior vice president of corporate communications for @entity10 , told me that since filming is n't set to resume until the spring , the network has not yet had to make a decision on @entity13 's role			1
he said he could n't comment on the @entity56 interview			0
despite the fact that an average of 14.6 million @entity35 tune in each week to track the adventures of the @entity13 family when you count @entity127 recordings , i 've never understood the appeal			1
for me , the question is n't why @entity13 was suspended			1
the real mystery is why he and his family -- who run a successful business making supplies for duck hunters -- have a television show in the first place			0
here is what you need to keep in mind as you waddle through this controversy : the reason that " @entity11 " is on television is to make liberal studio executives at @entity10 , and parent company @entity145 feel superior , while making big profits for the studio			2
the @entity148 are on television so that people in @entity151 and @entity58 -- the kind of folks who refer to anyplace in between as " flyover country " -- can feel progressive and enlightened by comparing themselves to simple country folks in @entity157 who , according to the elites , are neither			0
( and can make lots of money doing so			0
) " @entity11 ' is this era 's ode to " @entity163			1
" in that show -- which aired on radio and television from the 1920s through the 1960s and which was created , written and produced by white people -- @entity35 were given the opportunity to laugh at @entity35 , adding insult to the injury that this group of citizens was already sustaining before the civil rights movement			2
now , @entity35 have a new group to laugh at -- a self - described " bunch of rednecks from @entity157			0
" here 's the irony			0
this show is successful at least in part because the characters say things that many @entity35 consider colorful and crude			0
that 's the schtick of the @entity13 clan			1
now @entity13 is in hot water for staying in character and saying something colorful and crude			2
that is , @entity13 was suspended for doing in print what he has , for the last four years , been paid to do on television			2
that 's awfully hypocritical of @entity10			0
the network is embarrassed and would surely like to distance itself from the @entity13 family			1
however , it seems , it would like to stay acquainted with the millions of dollars the show generates each year			0
the network should be embarrassed			0
not by what @entity13 said ; it could n't control that			2
it should be embarrassed about what it could control : the way it responded and the mess it made of this situation			0
in discussing this story , commentators have been talking a lot about rights			0
@entity13 had the right to express his opinion			2
the network that has chosen to co-mingle its brand with the @entity13 brand had the right to suspend him			1
viewers who support the family have the right to boycott the network			0
but with rights come responsibilities , and -- as far as @entity10 executives are concerned -- they include the responsibility to avoid the hypocrisy of continuing to profit from a persona they created that they now claim to find offensive			1
now if you 'll excuse me , i think the " @entity11 " holiday marathon is well under way			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			2

@entity239 : @entity13 's role in *future* " @entity11 " shows *unclear*
he says the network that airs the show is continuing to profit from it
new episodes are to be aired in january , and there 's a holiday marathon
@entity239 : network gains from the @entity13 persona , which it helped create
