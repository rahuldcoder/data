@entity0 -- @entity2 cuts an incongruous figure at the @entity4			2
among the suited middle - aged men selling military hardware she looks more like a beach - loving backpacker , casually dressed in a black tank - top with a camera slung around her neck			2
but what really marks her out among all the arms salesmen touting the newest military technology -- " lethal but affordable " reads one sign above a missile manufacturer -- is that she one of the few people present with operational military experience			1
she 's a former drone pilot for the @entity24 military and represents the new face of air force pilots			2
@entity2 now works for @entity27 training future operators of unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity30 )			1
typically they would sit in front of a number of display monitors , often thousands of miles away from the drones themselves , using just a mouse , joystick and ergonomic pad to direct the deadly payload			2
training takes only a few months depending on the trainee 's knowledge , she says , and it helps to know something about aeronautics and physics			0
but so far removed are modern unmanned aerial vehicle pilots from their counterparts in cockpits , that basic computer knowledge is n't even essential before learning to fly a uav			2
" some ( we train ) do n't know how to use a mouse , " says @entity52 - @entity51 , a senior consultant the @entity27			0
" not all of our customers are in the modern world , " he adds			0
drones have become a huge part of military operations across the world			1
according to a @entity62 @entity64 research paper , the @entity62 has nearly 7,500 @entity30 of all sizes and capabilities , making up nearly a third of all its military aircraft , compared to 2005 when they were one in twenty			1
that ratio will probably rise in the next few years with some in the industry predicting that within five years half of @entity62 military aircraft will be unmanned			1
other countries , from the @entity75 to @entity76 , are developing their own uav systems , made possible by their relative cheapness compared to manned aircraft			0
from the smallest that can be launched by hand to the largest that can be the same size as a @entity84 , drones are used to do what most in the industry call the three @entity87 : dull , dirty and dangerous			0
the " dull " part covers missions like border surveillance and maritime patrols that need eyes in the sky for hours at a time			1
" @entity100 " is much more open to interpretation , but the " dangerous " part is clearly defined as when a pilot in a similar mission could become a casualty			0
@entity52 - @entity51 was a pilot in the @entity24 air force and can recall missions he might rather have not have flown when he was a pilot			0
while obviously an advocate for unmanned systems , he suggests their role can be divisive , even within his own family			1
" my son is a pilot in the air force and we have a lot of arguments			0
i believe that unmanned technology will take over and do some missions that i would prefer my son not to do ; he thinks otherwise , " he says			1
more uavs in missions also brings into question the role of humans in combat environments			1
as well as keeping pilots out of danger , could keeping a human out of an immediate mission area lead to better , calmer decisions being made during critical missions ? " it depends on the mission , but you 'll always need to have that critical thinking capability in a pilot , " says major @entity126 of the @entity129 's @entity30 division			1
" you need people to assess situations , especially landing in a hot zone of some sort , but i think it is the future for our defense ; more and more unmanned			0
" unmanned land vehicles that can offer support behind ground troops or drive themselves in convoys are still being trialed and developed by the likes of @entity148 , but aerial drones are now so prevalent that some in the industry think the market is saturated with manufacturers			2
yet as uav technology improves they are set to become an even more important part of security and military operations -- part of a system that gathers and relays information to other drones , ground control , manned aircraft and satellites			1
" they 've become a network of networks , like the internet , " says @entity52 - @entity51 , who says @entity27 alone has a $ 10.5 billion backorder for @entity30 and the communications systems they are part of			1
as well as a different face , @entity2 then represents just one small part of this new network changing the way militaries operate			0
on a human level they are quite straightforward , " uavs are easy to fly , " she says			0
" anyone can be trained			0

@entity30 -- drones -- now a huge part of military operations across globe
*congressional* paper : @entity62 has nearly 7,500 @entity30 of all sizes and capabilities
*analysts* predict half of @entity62 military aircraft will be unmanned within five years
uavs in missions raise questions over role of humans in combat environments
