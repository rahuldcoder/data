in @entity5 sharing beer from a communal cup and the conversation is getting heated			1
we 're discussing president @entity9 's house refurbishment using more than 200 million rand of state funds -- a move being investigated by the country 's anti-corruption watchdog			1
" @entity19 , he lives there in his own @entity21 , and we have nothing , " spits a drinker while whacking his fly swatter furiously against the bench we 're sitting on , lashing one unfortunate drinker			2
it 's just another afternoon in @entity25 's most famous township -- a hotbed for political dissent since its creation in 1903 as part of the forced resettlement of black workers from @entity32			1
@entity5 , now incorporated into wider @entity32 , is a generally safe and culturally rich place to visit that 's gone through substantial regeneration in the past few years			2
we 're seeing it by bicycle , a far more direct way to appreciate the street life than from behind the windows of a tour bus			2
our guide is local man @entity43 , from @entity45 's @entity44			2
the roads are good , although be warned : @entity5 has hills -- but they 're a great place to catch the views including of the new @entity51 stadium and @entity52 , which you can bungee jump from			1
shebeens shebeens were originally a type of illegal pub , normally run by women in shacks to service men living in workers ' hostels			2
now they 're legal and a place to while away the hours drinking umqombothi , a traditional beer made from maize , as we discover during a visit to a shebeen in the poor @entity5 quarter of @entity74			1
with communal toilets and taps , and raw sewage running in the streets , living conditions are tough and the shebeen a kind of refuge			1
@entity43 explains the strategies shebeens used to employ during police raids			2
" the shack had no windows , so you could n't see inside , " he says			2
" people were told not to make any noise but that 's hard after a few drinks , so if the police came they would start pretending to worship -- as if it was a church service			1
" another cunning plan was to dress in traditional @entity25 attire , as if the drinkers were in the midst of a @entity100 ceremony			2
@entity43 gives an example as he dons a beaded head - dress and jewelry , much to the mirth of the assembled clientele			2
other typical places to eat and drink in @entity5 include @entity107 , a tavern ( corner of @entity110 and @entity111 ) ; @entity112 ( @entity113 ; +27 11 936 9128 ) and @entity114 ( @entity113 ; +27 11 536 1379 ) serve upmarket township fare			1
@entity45 's @entity44 owner of the first and apparently only black - run backpackers hostel in @entity25 , @entity116 started offering overnight accommodation at his great - grandparents ' house in 1998 before officially opening the guesthouse and bike tour business in 2003			1
" i came into the industry because i wanted to see people getting off the [ tour ] bus , " @entity45 says			2
" @entity5 is a great place to learn about the history of @entity25			0
every person and every building has a story to tell			0
" set on a hill with views over the more affluent @entity5 suburb of @entity138 and near the much - visited @entity113 , @entity45 's backpackers feels a bit like a laid - back beach hotel			1
there 's even a sandy bar area out back where you can enjoy a beer and fried fish before setting out on a bike or walking tour			1
or you can just sit around and chat with the employees , including @entity45 's @entity152 wife @entity151 who came to work for him and never left			0
@entity153 street , @entity138 ; +27 11 936 3444 @entity113 this buzzy road was home to two @entity157 winners , @entity158 and @entity159 , who , like @entity5 , are icons of the struggle against apartheid			1
it 's also where successful locals come to rev up their mercs and blare out the latest kwaito ( a form of @entity25 house music ) from booming speakers -- it makes our bike tires judder			1
you can learn about @entity5 's past as a center of resistance at the @entity178 memorial and museum off @entity113 ( 8287 khumalo st. ; +27 11 536 2253 ) , named after a 13 - year - old boy shot dead by police during a peaceful student protest in 1976			1
@entity158 lived on @entity113 with his first and second wives			1
his house has since been turned into @entity185 ( 8115 @entity138 ; +27 11 936 7754 ) featuring exhibits and personal items such as the first shoes he wore as a free man			0
the road has some cool street art , the result of a competition among 130 local artists			0
the winning wall murals , sculptures and mosaics are inspired by daily township life and @entity5 's history			1
learn the lingo if you want to interact with @entity203 as you peddle through the streets , you should learn a few words of the local slang			0
@entity203 have a wicked sense of humor and the lingo is fast , furious and funny			0
on being greeted by us white folk on @entity113 , one guy solemnly told us : " do n't talk to me , talk to my lawyer			1
" take your choice of how to say hello			0
the common @entity25 handshake involves the normal gesture , followed by a clasping of the thumbs and then back to a normal handshake			0
variations on the ending include a slow sliding of the palms together or a snapping of your thumbs in tandem ( tricky at first )			0
in @entity5 it 's popular to use the @entity230 greeting " hola " to say hi ( the reasons why are obscure )			0
or the @entity232 " for " how are you ? " to which the streetwise reply is " yebo " -- " cool			1
" a popular expression is " @entity238 , " meaning anything from " agreed " to " hello , " " bye " or " great			0
" if you hear someone saying it , you can be sure they 're happy			0
in @entity5 , a " kota " is a kind of local version of a burger			0
a quarter loaf of bread is hollowed out and filled with various delights such as chips , egg , mince and achaar ( a kind of pickle salad )			0
and if kids run up to you on your bike and plead with you to " shoot " them , they do n't have a death wish but want you to take a photo of them			0
boutique hotel @entity260 is one of @entity5 's oldest neighborhoods and the venue for the signing of the @entity265 in 1955 , when thousands of activists agreed on a document that would form the basis of the country 's post-apartheid constitution			0
@entity271 is a vast and impressive area of modernist architecture with an unusual monument and art gallery , shops and a bustling marketplace			0
you can hop off your bike and walk into @entity277 on the square ( +27 11 527 7300 )			0
a funky boutique hotel featuring black and white photos by the late great black @entity25 photographer @entity282 , afro - retro decor and friendly staff , it 's a great place to recover while listening to live jazz and sipping a cocktail			1
the hotel 's founding partner @entity288 trained in @entity290 and worked for luxury chains abroad but returned to @entity25 to launch her vision for a high quality @entity5 hotel			0
" my vision was to start a company with a typical @entity25 flavor -- a place where we could begin to define @entity25 hospitality , " she says .			1
