-- scientists at the @entity2 managed to make two proton beams collide at high energy tuesday , marking a " new territory " in physics , according to @entity7 , the @entity7			1
the $ 10 billion research tool has been accelerating the beams since november in the @entity2 's 17 - mile tunnel on the border of @entity12 and @entity13			1
the beams have routinely been circulating at 3.5 tev , or teraelectron volts , the highest energy achieved at the @entity2 so far , according to @entity7 , the @entity7			1
watch live web cast from @entity7 the first two attempts tuesday failed , said @entity18 , @entity7 's director for accelerators			0
he said the beams were lost before they reached their full energy			2
experiments at the @entity2 may help answer fundamental questions such as why @entity25 's theory of relativity -- which describes the world on a large scale -- does n't jibe with quantum mechanics , which deals with matter far too small to see			1
the collider may help scientists discover new properties of nature			2
the as - yet theoretical @entity35 , also called " the @entity37 particle " in popular parlance , could emerge within two or three years , @entity18 said in november			1
evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a " super partner " with similar properties in a quantum dimension ( according to some physics theories , there are hidden dimensions in the universe ) -- could crop up as early as 2010			2
the collider has been dogged by problems			0
it made headlines late last year when a bird apparently dropped a " bit of baguette " into the accelerator , making the machine shut down			0
the incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut , said spokeswoman @entity62			0
had the machine been going , there would have been no damage , but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures , she said			1
the collider achieved its first full - circle beam in september 2008 amid much celebration			2
but just nine days later , the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the @entity2 came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine , @entity18 said			1
the faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two - thirds of an inch by two - thirds of an inch			2
should tuesday 's experiment go as planned and scientists are able to establish 7 tev collisions , the plan is to run them continuously for 18 to 24 months with a short technical stop at the end of 2010 , @entity7 said			1
" it will be the beginning of a long period of running the accelerator with beams at this energy , " @entity90 said			0
" it 's the period in which experiments will really start to collect data in this new energy region , where the potential for discoveries may be made			0
" @entity90 compared the experiments to @entity104 sailing for the @entity105 in 1492 , when he knew what he was looking for but did n't know what he might find			0
" it 's going into a new energy region , " she said			0
" it 's a new territory in particle physics , so we 're really just standing on the threshold of that , which is exciting for everybody here , of course			0

@entity2 to begin *smashing* proton beams at high speed
$ 10 billion research tool back *online* after tech *glitches* caused 18 - month delay
scientists hope project will prove existence of @entity35 boson " @entity37 particle "
