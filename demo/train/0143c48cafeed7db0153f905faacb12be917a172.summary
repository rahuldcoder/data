@entity0 , @entity1 -- several dozen protesters picketed a cultural center in @entity0 , @entity1 , on saturday as part of continued demonstrations against a controversial regional languages bill			1
at least 12 people have joined a hunger strike over the past two weeks in protest of the bill , introduced in may by the ruling @entity12			1
one student was hospitalized saturday in life - threatening condition after seven days on hunger strike , according to @entity16 , where the young woman studies			1
in total , four protesters have been admitted to clinics for treatment over the past three days , @entity1 's health ministry and the protest movement said			1
the protesters fear that the future of the @entity27 language will be severely undermined by the bill , which aims to provide regional status to the 18 languages spoken by ethnic minorities in @entity1 , including @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
under the bill , minorities would be able to have their mother tongue taught in schools and use those languages in official documents , among other benefits			2
the architect of the bill -- parliament deputy from the ruling party @entity45 -- says such legislation is necessary if @entity1 wants to become part of the @entity48			1
" we 've had many checks on the human rights issues in @entity1 by @entity53 organizations -- and they noticed many violations			2
minority languages has been one of them			0
our bill is written in full compliance with the @entity53 charter for minority languages , which is aimed at preserving minority languages and protecting them , " @entity45 said			2
the bill does n't stipulate that @entity1 may have several official state languages -- something which can be changed only through a nationwide referendum			1
however the opposition insists that providing even a regional status to the @entity32 language -- widely spoken in 13 regions of the country by roughly 20 million people -- would severely undermine the development of the @entity27 language			1
the protesters fear that should the use of @entity32 be legalized , nobody would want to learn @entity27			2
@entity79 sessions in recent months on the controversial bill have erupted in fistfights between @entity1 's legislators as deputies opposing the bill clashed with those from the ruling party			1
earlier this month , the bill passed the second hearing in the @entity89 with 248 deputies voting for it			0
the opposition claims the vote was rigged and called on president @entity94 not to ratify the bill and prevent it from becoming law			0
the president has n't yet responded to those demands			0
" we issued an ultimatum to the authorities to abolish this bill			0
there has been no intention or even a hint from president @entity94 that he could do so			0
that 's why our hunger strike would continue for weeks or months -- as long as we are alive , " said @entity107 , a member of the protest movement			1
@entity111 traveled to @entity0 on saturday all the way from a village in @entity1 to participate			0
" we have to defend our language and our culture -- the two things most dear to us , " he said			0
while protesters continue their standoff , the government is producing few comments on the matter			0
the final say is with @entity94 , who is still weighing whether to put his signature on the bill , but promises to respect all sides of the conflict			0
but @entity1 's leader already said that if the crisis is not resolved , a dissolution of parliament and an early ballot can not be ruled out .			2
