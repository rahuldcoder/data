do n't consider this a count - down to doomsday , but on february 15 an asteroid is going to come pretty close to @entity3			1
and this is only one of thousands of objects that are destined to one day enter our neighborhood in space			2
" there are lots of asteroids that we 're watching that we have n't yet ruled out an @entity3 impact , but all of them have an impact probability that is very , very low , " @entity10 , manager of the @entity11 at @entity13 's @entity12 , said at a press briefing			1
this particular asteroid is called 2012 @entity23			2
@entity13 scientists reiterated thursday that people have nothing to worry about			1
" no @entity3 impact is possible , " @entity10 said			1
the asteroid is thought to be 45 meters -- about half a football field -- long			2
it will come no closer than 17,100 miles from our planet 's surface			0
what would happen if the asteroid hit an object the size of 2012 @entity23 appears to hit @entity3 about once every 1,200 years , @entity10 said			1
" there really has n't been a close approach that we know about for an object of this size , " @entity10 said			0
on its close approach to @entity3 , the asteroid will be traveling at 7.8 kilometers per second , roughly eight times the speed of a bullet from a high - speed rifle , he said			1
if it were to hit our planet -- which is , again , impossible -- it would collide with the energy of 2.4 megatons of @entity50 , @entity10 said			0
this is comparable to the event in @entity53 , @entity54 , in 1908			0
that asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded , leveling trees over an area of 820 square miles -- about two - thirds the size of @entity61			2
like that rock , 2012 @entity23 would likely not leave a crater			0
here 's a comforting thought : meteorites enter the @entity3 's atmosphere all the time			1
about 100 tons of rocks come in from space every day , @entity10 said			0
they are mostly small , from the size of a grain of sand to the size of a human fist			0
if you have a telescope at least a few inches in diameter , you would see it as a small point of light moving across the sky , said @entity81 , director of the @entity82 at the @entity83			0
you 'll have to be located in @entity86 , @entity87 or @entity88 for the best telescope - aided view , scientists said			0
it wo n't be visible to the naked eye			0
more on the february 15 asteroid approach what else is out there ? so , we know that this particular asteroid is n't going to hit us , but how about all of those other giant rocks floating nearby beyond our atmosphere ? @entity13 says 9,672 objects have been classified as @entity102 , or @entity102 , as of february 5			1
near @entity102 are comets or asteroids in orbits that allow them to enter @entity3 's neighborhood			1
there 's an important distinction between these objects : comets are mostly water , ice and dust , while asteroids are mostly rock or metal			0
both comets and asteroids have hit @entity3 in the past			1
more than 1,300 @entity102 have been classified as potentially hazardous to @entity3 , meaning that someday , they may come close or hit @entity3			1
@entity13 is monitoring these objects and updating their locations as new information comes in			1
right now , scientists are n't warning of any imminent threats			0
@entity126 and colleagues are using telescopes on the ground and in space to nail down the precise orbit of objects that might threaten @entity3 and predict whether the planet could be hit			1
observatories around the world send their findings to the @entity13 - funded @entity82 , which keeps a database of all known asteroids and comets in our solar system			2
@entity13 also has a space probe tracking asteroids to learn more about them			2
the @entity146 probe was launched in 2007 and has already sent back dramatic pictures from the giant asteroid @entity149			2
the spacecraft is now heading to the dwarf planet @entity151			0
@entity149 and @entity151 are the two most massive objects in the main asteroid belt			2
a new asteroid adventure in 2016 a mission that 's scheduled to launch in 2016 will teach scientists even more about asteroids			2
@entity159 will visit an asteroid called 1999 @entity161 , take a sample of at least 2.1 ounces and bring it back to @entity3			1
" this is going to be the largest sample of an extraterrestrial object returned to @entity3 since end of the @entity172 missions over 40 years ago , " said @entity163 , deputy principal investigator for the mission , who is based at the @entity165 , @entity166			1
the probe will arrive at the asteroid in 2018 , study it , then bring back the sample in 2023			1
1999 @entity161 is made of materials " almost identical to those that were present when the solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago , " he said			0
that means studying this asteroid could yield greater understanding about the sources of organic molecules and water that gave rise to life			0
this asteroid , like the one that will fly by on february 15 , is considered a near - @entity3 object			1
the mission would further clarify the threat that this particular object poses , and better predict the orbits of other near - @entity3 asteroids , @entity163 said			1
scientists at the @entity165 are collaborating with @entity13 and @entity199 on this mission			1
to better predict the orbits of hazardous objects , this group is looking at the @entity205 effect , a force created when the asteroid absorbs sunlight and re-radiates it as heat			2
the effect is , at first glance , quite small -- @entity163 cited his colleague @entity212 's comparison of this effect to the force you feel when you hold grapes in your hand			0
but over time , it 's an important consideration when trying to understand where an asteroid is headed			0
" that force , applied over millions of years , can literally move mountains of rock around , " @entity163 said			0
we ca n't say this enough : do n't panic over it			0

asteroid will fly by @entity3 on february 15
@entity13 : 9,672 objects have been classified as @entity102
the @entity159 mission will take a sample from a different asteroid and bring it back
