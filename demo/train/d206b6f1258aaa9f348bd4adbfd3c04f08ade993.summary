@entity0 -- amid a din of whistles and klaxons , and bearing banners emblazoned with " no cuts " and " austerity is failing , " thousands of protesters marched past @entity0 's landmarks saturday in a show of popular anger over government cutbacks			1
" i do n't like the government 's policy , i do n't think it works and i think the most vulnerable people suffer -- that 's why i 'm here , " said one woman on the march			1
the planned cuts to services and payments that help the sick and disabled are " shameful , " she said			0
culminating in a mass rally in @entity25 , the protest , staged by unions representing public sector workers and others , reflects a rising tide of discontent among many over the austerity measures brought in or proposed by the coalition government			2
marches were also held in the @entity37 city of @entity38 and @entity39 in @entity40			1
addressing the crowds , opposition leader @entity42 , of the @entity43 , criticized the government 's policies as unfairly putting the burden of austerity on ordinary workers and cutting " too far , too fast			1
" " none of these people think that @entity51 owes them a living , none of these people are asking for the earth -- they just have a simple request : they want a @entity51 that works for them			1
they believe we do better as one nation , " he said			0
@entity42 was booed , however , when he said that he could not promise " easy times , " or rule out any cuts to services			1
if in power , a @entity43 government too would have to take steps to balance the books , he said -- although he insisted it would target the country 's millionaires with tax rises , rather than taking money from the poorest members of society , as he accuses the government of doing			1
a banner carried by one protester put the responsibility for the country 's woes squarely on the shoulders of the prime minister , proclaiming " @entity84 has butchered @entity51			1
" but speaking at his @entity86 's national conference earlier this month , @entity84 defended the government 's austerity program , saying " painful decisions " had to be made to bring down the deficit			1
he acknowledged , though , that the path ahead was not easy			0
" here 's the truth , " @entity84 said			1
" the damage was worse than we thought , and it 's taking longer than we hoped			2
" but public sector worker @entity95 , 42 , said life was getting too tough for many , as costs continue to rise			0
" i think the deficit is an excuse to cut our wages and cut public services , " he told @entity1			0
" my pay has been frozen for three years now and it 's really hard to make ends meet			2
" the @entity105 , a federation that includes most @entity51 unions , said ahead of the event , dubbed " a future that works , " that it expected tens of thousands of union members to turn out in @entity0			1
the @entity111 declined to provide an estimate of the number taking part in the march and rally			0
while the demonstration itself was peaceful , groups of masked youths were seen shouting at police and running through the streets in central @entity0 on saturday afternoon			1
a police spokesman said officers had responded to some incidents but that no damage to property had been reported			2
@entity105 secretary general @entity128 told protesters in @entity25 : " we have a stark and united message for the government			1
it is hitting our jobs , our services , our living standards			0
" " it is hammering the poorest and the most vulnerable			0
and austerity is failing even on its own terms , for this is a government of broken promises			2
" ministers told us that if we only accept the pain , recovery would come			0
instead we have been mired in a double dip recession			0
" the @entity105 wants the government to abandon its program of cuts to public services and austerity measures in favor of investment in infrastructure , new industries and training			0
without a focus on growth and job creation , especially for young people , the nation faces a " lost decade " of decline , it warns			0
chancellor @entity165 said last month though that the economy was " healing , " and that the government 's strategy was delivering results " despite strong headwinds			2
" " but the scale of the challenge is so great that there are no quick fixes or easy routes to recovery , " he told business leaders in @entity37			0
" the debts built up in our economy over the last decade will take time to unwind			0
" both @entity165 and @entity84 have pointed to the eurozone crisis as a factor in the current economic situation , saying it has cast a shadow over the @entity51 economy			1
@entity51 is one of a number of @entity192 nations , @entity193 and @entity194 among them , laboring under a large burden of public debt in the wake of the global economic downturn			1
violent clashes between police and protesters have broken out at anti-austerity protests in @entity203 and @entity193 in recent months			2
the @entity51 unemployment rate fell slightly to 7.9 % for the period from june to august this year , the @entity204 said this week			2
however , many young people are without work			0
@entity1 's @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
