in increasingly virtual @entity1 , the latest bizarre fad is watching someone eat online			1
called ' muk - bang ' in @entity1 , which translates to ' eating broadcasts , ' online channels live - stream people eating enormous servings of food while chatting away to those who are watching			1
the queen of this particular phenomenon is the diva , a waifish , pretty 33 - year - old woman apparently blessed with the stomach capacity of several elephants and the metabolism of a hummingbird			1
every evening around 8 p.m , several thousand viewers tune in to watch @entity12 -- real name @entity20 -- begin inhaling enough food for several college linebackers			1
she easily polishes off four large pizzas or three kilograms ( 6 lb ) of beef in one sitting , albeit over the span of several hours			0
after she eats , she spends another two or three hours just talking to her fans , who communicate with her via a chat room which accompanies her live - stream channel			1
for @entity20 , online eating is not just a niche hobby but a significant source of income — she makes up to ₩ 10 million ( $ 9,300 ) a month from her broadcasts alone			1
her costs are also high , however			0
she says she spends an average of $ 3,000 per month purchasing food for her show , which she broadcasts for about four to six hours per night			1
confessions of a diva thanks to the live chat room that accompanies her channel , feedback is instantaneous and the show interactive			1
comments flood in and she reads from them in real time			0
" my fans tell me that they really love watching me eat because i do so with so much gusto and make everything look so delicious , " says @entity52			0
" a lot of my viewers are on diets and they say they live vicariously through me , or they are hospital patients who only have access to hospital food so they also watch my broadcasts to see me eat			1
" while it would seem that her metabolism would make her public enemy number one , some of the @entity12 's biggest fans are women , and indeed her channel is more popular with women than with men , with a 60 - 40 ratio			2
" one of the best comments i ever received from a viewer who said that she had gotten over her anorexia by watching me eat , " says @entity52			0
" that really meant a lot to me			0
" she cooks about a third of the food that she eats , and the rest she has delivered			2
offers of sponsorship have come in thick and fast , but she says she tests out sponsored food first and only features what she truly likes and wants to share			2
her fans show their appreciation by sending her money , in the form of virtual tokens that can be cashed in			0
@entity91 , the publicly - listed social networking site that hosts her channel , allows users to buy and send virtual " star balloons " which can be monetized after the site takes a 30 - 40 % commission			2
any payment by viewers is purely voluntary , as all channels can be viewed for free			0
the service is currently limited to @entity1 , although the company has plans to expand it to other countries			1
cultural background the @entity12 's success and the @entity1 eating broadcasting trend can be attributed to a number of specific cultural factors			1
" we think it 's because of three big reasons — the rise of one - person households in @entity1 , their ensuing loneliness and finally the huge trend of ' well - being culture ' and excessive dieting in @entity1 society right now , " says @entity91 public relations coordinator @entity110			1
while watching food porn on a diet may sound like masochistic torture , apparently lonely , hungry @entity121 prefer to eat vicariously			1
another thing , @entity121 hate eating alone			1
" for @entity121 , eating is an extremely social , communal activity , which is why even the @entity1 word ' family ' means ' those who eat together , ' " says professor @entity52 of @entity127 's @entity126			1
she believes its the interactive aspect of eating broadcasts that 's so appealing to these lonely hearts			1
@entity138 was also the catalyst for the diva			2
" so many of my friends were getting married and i was living alone and lonely and bored , " she says			2
" when i first started my channel two years ago , i was showing a variety of content , from dance to outdoor activities , but it was my love of eating that really began drawing a response from fans , " says @entity52			2
the setting and then there 's the platform to make the phenomenon possible in the first place			0
it 's difficult to imagine the unique live - streaming online platform of @entity91 working as well on a daily basis anywhere other than @entity1 's extremely wired culture			1
with 78.5 % of the entire population on smartphones and 7 million people riding the @entity164 subway network every day , @entity91 is becoming particularly popular with @entity1 commuters , given that the @entity164 subway has cellphone reception and @entity168 , and @entity1 smartphones have tv streaming capabilities			2
" our mobile users surpassed our pc users a while ago , and most of our viewers watch our content while they are on the move , " says @entity110			0
the majority of @entity91 's content is actually online gaming , where individual broadcasters called ' @entity182 ' ( short for @entity183 ) , stream their gaming live for others to learn from or comment on			0
anyone can live - stream from any device as long as they log in			0
" eating broadcasts " began popping up around 2009 , says @entity110 , when users began to imitate celebrities ' food shows by commenting as they were eating while broadcasting			2
now , of the platform 's 5,000 channels that are streaming at any given point in time , 5 % of those are eating broadcasts			0
@entity91 has a daily average viewership of 3 million			0
spinning off the @entity199 says her success was a huge surprise , but there are still many who do n't understand the concept and are liberal with their criticism			0
" i get some really awful commenters who make me reexamine ' why am i doing this again ? ' but at the end of the day the positive feedback overwhelmingly outweighs the bad , so i am happy to continue			0
" while @entity20 maintained her real estate consulting day job over the past two years , she quit last week to focus more on her eating broadcasts and potential spinoff businesses , including a clothing company			1
when asked if she has any time for a private life , considering she broadcasts more than six hours a day every day including weekends , the answer is that she does n't need one			0
" this is a lot more fun , " she says .			0
