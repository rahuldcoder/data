@entity0 -- the arrival of prince @entity3 on a @entity5 military mission to the @entity6 puts him at the center of a diplomatic storm with @entity9 about who owns the archipelago the two nations went to war over in 1982			1
@entity3 's six - week posting with an air force search and rescue crew has further inflamed anger in @entity9 , where hostility towards @entity5 over the territory it calls @entity6 is already intense			1
@entity9 president @entity19 and @entity5 prime minister @entity20 have both been drawn into a bitter war of words in recent weeks , reviving memories of conflict			1
meanwhile @entity9 has recruited regional allies such as @entity26 to back its claim to the islands			2
why are the @entity6 in demand ? located in the @entity30 , about 480 kilometers east of the tip of @entity32 , the windswept @entity6 have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources			1
their remoteness , however , exposed them to neglect and complex wrangling over ownership among @entity5 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity9 interests			1
@entity9 's forerunners formally declared possession in 1820 , prompting @entity5 to reclaim a sovereignty it originally declared in 1765			1
falklands conflict in photos : high - res gallery despite regular challenges , notably in 1982 , @entity5 control has endured and the @entity6 ' current 2,500 inhabitants look to @entity0 to safeguard oil , fishing , farming and tourism incomes			1
what happened in 1982 ? the @entity6 became a battleground as @entity5 and @entity9 sent warships , submarines , aircraft and troops to the islands			1
diplomatic hostilities initially broke out over @entity9 activities on @entity68 -- an even remoter @entity5 territory in the @entity30			1
@entity71 forces were dispatched by @entity5 prime minister @entity72 as @entity9 president @entity74 's military dictatorship launched a @entity6 invasion on april 2			1
troops fought on the islands , aircraft were shot down and ships were attacked with significant losses of life -- most notably the @entity83 and @entity5 's @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity82			1
@entity5 declared an end to fighting after 74 days following the surrender of @entity9 troops			1
@entity9 put its death toll at 645			2
@entity5 's civil and military losses amounted to 255			0
how did the @entity91 and other world powers react ? president @entity94 's administration nailed its colors firmly to the @entity5 mast , declaring economic sanctions against @entity9			1
it also gave its @entity100 ally a strategic edge by supplying potent @entity103 missiles to counter @entity9 's @entity104			2
at the height of the conflict , a meeting in @entity108 , @entity43 of the world 's biggest economies -- including the @entity5 , @entity91 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity43 , @entity113 and @entity114 -- backed @entity5 's position			0
why wo n't the @entity5 give up the islands like it did @entity117 ? @entity5 acknowledges its claim to the @entity6 is disputed , but has no intention of discussing the sovereignty issue , according to professor @entity121 , an expert in maritime territorial disputes at @entity124 's @entity123			1
he says that there is no comparison to @entity117 , which @entity5 returned to @entity128 control after expiry of a set lease in 1997			0
" the @entity5 position on the @entity6 is that they are under @entity5 sovereignty -- they are not leased from anyone			1
" what has happened to the islands since the end of the war in 1982 ? spurred by the conflict and stung by accusations of neglect , @entity5 began taking renewed economic interest in the @entity6			1
it protected fishing rights and asserted control over oil exploration licences			0
it also stepped up its military interests , building a new airfield and bolstering naval , army and air force presences			0
see high - res images of life in the @entity6 cooperation between @entity5 and @entity9 -- by now an established democracy whose militarist past has left current leaders distrustful of its armed forces -- has improved , but @entity158 continued to reject any territorial claim to @entity6 other than its own			1
so why is the language between @entity0 and @entity158 more tense now ? pure politics say analysts			0
the deployment of @entity5 's prince @entity3 has added to the theater , as have claims and counter-claims of colonialism -- and @entity5 's decision this week to send its newest destroyer @entity170			1
but , they say , the real source is @entity9 politicians seeking to divert voters from the pain caused by inflation and reduced subsidies on oil , gas and electricity			0
" the government is being squeezed from lots of different areas , so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the @entity6 issue , " said professor @entity181 , an expert in @entity183 politics at @entity184 in @entity185			0
" it 's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on			0
" in the @entity5 , @entity20 -- an heir to @entity72 's @entity200 legacy -- must be seen to defend the principles his predecessor mobilized the troops for			0
" it 's not about asserting a claim , it 's about allowing people of the @entity6 to have the right to self - determination , " said @entity204 , a @entity5 falklands conflict veteran			1
what has @entity9 done to bolster its claims ? regional allies have been recruited to the cause , with members of the @entity32 @entity216 trading bloc uniting to ban @entity6 - flagged vessels from their ports			1
this is largely " diplomatic dressing " that will do little to isolate the islands , says professor @entity222 , who heads the @entity183 program at @entity224 in @entity225 @entity181 adds that more effective pressure could be applied if @entity9 's @entity227 persuades @entity229 president @entity228 to cancel a vital air link between the islands and @entity232			2
is this now all about oil ? partly			0
there is @entity9 resentment of a @entity5 oil exploration project launched off the @entity6 in 2010			1
this has been worsened by @entity9 's recent relegation from exporter to net importer of hydrocarbons			0
analysts , however , insist this remains a sideshow to the political traction offered by the @entity6 dispute			0
how much oil is there ? press reports say up to 8.3 billion barrels of undersea oil reserves could lie in the @entity6 economic zone -- a radius of 320 - kilometers around the islands , but despite successful drilling finds in recent months , this quantity is still speculative			2
the figures are backed by claims from small oil ventures , including @entity261 and @entity262 & @entity263 , which are hoping to raise capital for further exploration in fields licensed by the islands ' @entity5 - backed government			2
attempts to attract investment in the projects has been hampered by the @entity273 dispute			0
many major oil firms have interests in @entity9 and are wary of upsetting @entity158 by involving themselves in the @entity6			2
also a problem is the considerable cost of extracting deep water reserves from the remote @entity30 -- although this becomes less of an issue as oil prices continue to climb			0
professor @entity283 , a petroleum economics expert at the @entity284 , described the @entity6 oil reserve estimates as " optimistic , " adding that even if they are proven , the cost of exploiting them could still be prohibitive			0
" it 's one thing doing exploration , but when you come to development , we 're talking about bigger volumes of materials and to get that there is expensive because at the moment there 's nothing there -- just sheep farmers , " he said			0
" it will take a few 100 million barrels to make it worth it , and there 's a number of ifs and buts before we get there			0
" is conflict likely again ? no , say analysts			0
while there are parallels with the 1980s -- politicians using @entity318 - @entity9 tensions to court votes and divert from economic woes at home -- there is little appetite for conflict on either side			0
any action is likely to remain in the diplomatic sphere			0
a former senior @entity5 military officer last month said @entity5 cutbacks had left the @entity5 unprepared for another @entity6 conflict			2
@entity9 is apparently in a similar state , with a heavily depleted military that experts say would be no match even for @entity5 's depleted force			2
" even if @entity9 wanted to go to war , they have no military capacity , " says @entity181			0
he said @entity227 's own antipathy towards the military -- a legacy of her political opposition to @entity9 's former dictatorship -- meant she would be unlikely to support even a maritime blockade of @entity5 vessels .			2
