-- @entity1 is a poor fishing village on the outskirt of @entity4 's capital , @entity5 , known globally as a destination for child sex			1
it 's a place where mothers sell their own daughters to child traffickers , who supply them to brothels locally and across the country			0
but how has such a perverse trade been able to take root , let alone flourish here ? @entity17 , senior researcher for @entity18 , an organization committed to combating the sexual exploitation of children , says several factors have made @entity4 a prime destination for child sex offenders			1
" insufficiently enforced laws , corruption , and the failure to address more overarching problems such as poverty and the negative side effects of globalization have made it a challenge for the country to shed the unenviable reputation as a destination for child sex , " he says			2
the authors of a 2011 @entity18 report identified a number of cultural and sociological factors that made @entity4 children " particularly vulnerable to adult predators			0
" " it has been observed that @entity4 children are indeed expected to abide by rules set forth by adults , and saying ' no ' to an adult is not easily tolerated , " reads the report			2
but what of the acceptance and willing participation of so many locals , including parents themselves , in the trade ? for @entity53 -- head of @entity54 , which aids @entity4 child survivors of the sex trade -- part of the answer as to why so many adults in @entity1 are able to abnegate their parental duty to protect may lie in @entity4 's brutal recent past , which left behind a fractured society			1
" what this country went through was unique in history , " says @entity53 , of the @entity67 's systematic destruction of religious , educational and social structures -- not least of which the family unit -- during its genocidal 1975 - 79 reign			1
when @entity74 's maniacal experiment ended , 2 million people were dead , and society 's institutions almost erased			0
" you lost your educated people and the system of educating them ; you lost the moral compass that @entity81 provided , " he says .			0

corruption , poverty and a bloody past have made @entity4 a child sex trade *hotspot*
@entity67 's systematic destruction of society led to the death of 2 million in the 1970s
report : culture plays a part as " saying ' no ' to an adult is not easily tolerated "
