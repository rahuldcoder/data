@entity0 in a vacant lot in the center of @entity3 , @entity4 , near a sign that implores passersby not to urinate there			1
it was here 10 years ago that a bomb tore through the @entity9 , for a split second silencing the crowd of revelers as they chatted , drank and danced on a typical saturday night out			1
@entity13 was there with his team mates from the @entity16 , australian rules football players on an end of season trip from @entity20 , on the country 's west coast			2
in his book " undefeated , " @entity13 , who received burns to 60 % of his body , describes the stench and burning in his throat from the bomb , before his hearing kicked in and the screams rang out			0
" it started really softly , a moaning or whimpering , then grew louder and louder			0
it sounded unnatural , as if it was part of a horror movie , and it was terrifying , " he wrote			0
@entity13 is back in @entity4 this week for memorial events to mark the 10 - year anniversary of the bombing			1
he 's one of thousands of victims , family members , government officials and dignitaries in @entity3 to pay their respects to those killed in what has been described as @entity48 's worst ever act of terrorism			1
on the night of october 12 , 2002 , just past 11 p.m. local time , a bomb went off inside @entity52 , sending clubbers out into the street and into the path of a massive car bomb outside the @entity9			1
a third , smaller bomb was detonated seconds later outside the @entity59 consulate but it caused no injuries			0
back on the tourist strip , the air was thick was smoke , flames and chaos as survivors tried to drag themselves and others to safety			2
two hundred and two people were killed ; 88 @entity70 , 38 @entity48 , 24 @entity71 , seven @entity59 and 30 others from a number of @entity75 countries			1
@entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 also lost citizens , as did @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
the attack was blamed on @entity85 ( @entity85 ) , a @entity86 militant group with links to @entity88			0
since the attack , @entity48 has tried and executed three perpetrators and killed other key conspirators in police raids			2
the last man to stand trial over the blasts , @entity93 , was jailed for 20 years in june for helping to assemble the bombs			1
writing in the @entity98 on thursday , @entity48 president @entity97 said 10 years on " we can say with some relief that justice has been done			1
" the @entity4 bombings , he wrote , " set off a series of critical chain reactions			1
@entity48 developed a highly skilled and dedicated police anti-terror unit			0
and an international campaign was launched to restore the image of @entity48 as a peaceful tourist destination			0
today , tourism in @entity4 has exceeded pre-attack figures			1
" one man who wo n't be in @entity3 this week , if ever , is @entity112 , the secretary of the @entity114 club			1
he lost his best friend , @entity115 , in the blast			0
@entity115 , or " @entity117 " as he was known , was one of 25 @entity114 players who were there celebrating the end of the rugby season			0
@entity122 did n't make it home			0
" i can pay my respects to @entity117 here , i do n't need to go to @entity4 and see what has n't been done , " @entity112 said from his home in @entity114 , a town of just 8,500 people in rural @entity127			1
he was referring to the site where the @entity9 once stood , which is now being used as a car park			1
" it 's a sacred site , " he said			1
" it 's like walking over someone 's grave			2
two hundred and two people died there ... i do n't need to go to and see that to be close to @entity115			2
he 's here with us			2
" campaigners had hoped by now there would be a permanent memorial to those killed in the attack			1
a monument to the dead now stands where @entity52 used to be , but @entity13 and other survivors want to see the @entity151 , a place of reflection for those killed , built on the @entity156 site			1
" initially there were people who planted some banana palms , so there were some things being grown there , which was ok , " @entity13 said			2
" at least it was n't being driven over , walked on , urinated on			0
" development is said to have been held up in haggling over the price			0
" the landowner is asking a ridiculous amount of money -- it 's not worth paying that much -- it 's just unrealistic			2
so we 've just got to work out what 's fair for everybody and come to a win - win , " @entity13 said			0
until then , survivors , friends and family members of those killed have created their own makeshift shrine			1
in the past few days , wreaths , flowers and photos of the dead have been laid on the former @entity156 site			1
an @entity70 flag hangs along a fence where someone has pinned photos of all 88 @entity70 killed , images crudely cut from a newspaper special			1
@entity13 was just 22 years old when he was caught in the blast			0
it was his first time in @entity4			1
" i flew in , was here for six hours and i got blown up , " he said			0
ten years on , he says with more than a hint of relief , " i 'm in a place mentally and physically that i could n't have dreamed of			0
" this is his eighth trip to @entity4 since the bombings , and another step in his personal journey from terror to a place of strength and peace			1
" just walking down the street i 'm bumping into people i 've met , or even seen in a paper , and you can just tell , you look at each other in the eyes and you can tell go , ' yep , you 've been there , you 've done it , ' " he said			0
" you have a handshake and a cuddle and a cry and you move on			0
it 's quite surreal ; it 's like we 've known each other , all these people , for so long , but never met			2
" while some may see the 10 year mark as a time to let go , @entity13 says , for him , the significance of the date wo n't fade over time			2
" ten years does mark a significant stepping off point , but for me , 11 , 12 , 15 , 20 years is going to feel exactly the same			2
when i wake up in the morning and i get changed i do n't see anything different each day			0
i see the scars of the burns that i got			0
" for me each year is going to be exactly the same			0
