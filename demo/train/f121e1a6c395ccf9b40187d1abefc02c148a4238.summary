journalists covering last week 's economic summit overheard @entity3 president @entity2 blasting @entity5 prime minister @entity4 as a " liar " during a talk with @entity9 president @entity8 , according to published reports			1
the private conversation was inadvertently carried by open microphones before an @entity8 - @entity2 news conference on the sidelines of the group of 20 economic summit in the @entity3 resort of @entity18			1
its contents were first reported by the @entity3 website @entity22 , which said reporters heard @entity2 's comments in @entity3 and @entity8 's reply through a translator			1
" i ca n't stand him			0
he 's a liar , " @entity2 said of @entity4 , according to the website			1
@entity8 replied , " you 're tired of him ; what about me ? i have to deal with him every day , " the site reported			1
@entity22 ( " @entity34 " ) said journalists had listened in on the conversation but had agreed not to report it			0
the @entity39 and @entity40 news services confirmed that report tuesday			2
" we did n't record it , and to use it would force us to admit that we had cheated , " @entity22 quoted one of the reporters who heard the conversation , whom it did not name			0
" also , it would have caused great problems for the people responsible for the event 's organization			0
" @entity52 , the @entity22 writer who broke the story , told @entity54 that about three minutes of the leaders ' private conversation could be heard			0
" it was a mistake by the organization for the @entity59 , " @entity52 said			0
he said journalists agreed among themselves to consider the remarks off the record because they did n't want to get a summit staffer heard into a " rough patch " after he disclosed that the audio could be heard			0
but the word spread rapidly among journalists in @entity68 , prompting @entity22 to start chasing the report , he said			0
" some of them did give me the quotes , and others just confirmed the quotes , " @entity52 said			0
the report was met with silence from the @entity76 , the @entity3 president 's office , which did not respond to requests for comment			1
in @entity83 , @entity82 spokesman @entity81 said he had no comment on the conversation or @entity8 's response but said , " the president 's position has been quite clear on the issue of efforts by the @entity91 to achieve through the @entity92 what can only be achieved effectively through direct negotiations			1
" @entity4 's office also had no comment			1
but in the @entity9 , the @entity97 said it was " deeply disappointed and saddened " by the private conversation , warning that it could hurt ties between @entity5 and two key players in the @entity101 peace process			2
" president @entity8 's response to mr. @entity2 implies that he agrees with the @entity3 leader , " adl director @entity103 said in a written statement			1
" in light of the revelations here , we hope that the @entity8 administration will do everything it can to reassure @entity5 that the relationship remains on a sure footing and to reinvigorate the trust between president @entity8 and prime minister @entity4 , which clearly is not what it should be			1
" a member of @entity4 's coalition in the @entity123 , @entity5 's parliament , said " there is not much love lost " between the @entity5 leader and his counterparts			2
" it 's unpleasant , " said @entity128 , whose @entity129 is allied with @entity4 's ruling @entity130			2
" of course , we would all like to be loved and all love to have great relationships with each other , and i 'm sure it would be nicer to know that our prime minister is loved			0
but at the end of the day , what did @entity137 say ? it 's more important to be feared than loved			0
" @entity5 opposition leaders have questioned @entity4 's honesty before , but @entity144 lawmaker @entity143 said he was " ashamed " that the leaders of two of @entity5 's top allies " could characterize my prime minister as a liar			1
" " if the most friendly leaders say that about my prime minister , what do others say about him who are not as friendly ? " said @entity143 , the head of the @entity5 - @entity151			2
" if he lies to them , he must be lying to @entity5 as well			0

" he 's a liar , " @entity2 says of @entity5 *pm* , a @entity3 website reports
" you 're tired of him ; what about me ? " the site quotes @entity8 as responding
neither leader 's office would comment on the report
an @entity5 lawmaker says the report is " unpleasant " but not news
