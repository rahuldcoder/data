she said the alleged failure of two top @entity9 officials to report abuse claims likely perpetuated a nightmarish loop of abuse			1

the men , each charged with one count of perjury and one count of failure to report suspected abuse , were released monday on $ 75,000 bail each after an arraignment hearing in a small courtroom packed with reporters			1

@entity24 and @entity90 stepped down late sunday after an emergency meeting of the university 's board of trustees			2
they " allegedly failed to report the sexual assault of a young boy after the information was brought to their attention , and later made false statements to a grand jury that was investigating a series of assaults on young boys , " @entity2 attorney general @entity11 said over the weekend			1
read the indictment ( @entity106 ) ( warning : graphic content ) the news sent shock waves through the @entity9 community , a university known for the good reputation of its athletic programs			1

moneys raised would have gone toward scholarships for the school 's general population , a drive the president called " our highest fund - raising priority			1
" " president @entity120 and his wife asked that it be postponed until spring because their attention is so heavily focused right now on the troubling charges by the attorney general , " @entity120 said in a statement			0
@entity24 asked to be placed on administrative leave so he could devote time needed to defend himself , the university said monday			0
@entity90 will go into retirement , it said			0

" " if true , the nature and amount of charges made are very shocking to me and all @entity188			0
while i did what i was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention , like anyone else involved , i ca n't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred , " @entity151 said in a statement			0
overheard on @entity0 : @entity9 head coach should 've done more according to the grand jury , @entity18 in some cases promised the boys gifts or invited them to football games and sleepovers			1

@entity18 , who retired from coaching in 1999 , maintains his innocence			1
@entity18 founded @entity164 , a charity to help troubled youth , in 1977 and it provided him with " access to hundreds of boys , many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations , " the grand jury said			1

" @entity18 , who was arrested and released saturday on $ 100,000 unsecured bail , faces seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and numerous other charges , including aggravated indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child			1
a preliminary hearing is scheduled for wednesday , but defense attorney @entity52 told @entity55 he expects it be postponed in order for attorneys to have enough time to bring in witnesses			0
the grand jury investigation was initiated by the claims of one boy who alleged that @entity18 had " indecently assaulted " him and engaged in sex acts while the boy was a guest at his home , according to the attorney general			2
the victim met @entity18 through the former coach 's @entity164 charity , @entity11 said			2
@entity18 allegedly used expensive gifts such as trips to professional and college games , golf clubs , a computer and money , @entity11 said			0
the relationship , which began in 2005 and lasted into 2008 , included overnight stays at @entity18 's home , where touching led to sexual acts , according to @entity11 and grand jury testimony			2
timeline of abuse claims " one of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late - night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in march of 2002 , in the locker room of the @entity286 on the @entity287 , " @entity11 said			2
" hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty , a graduate assistant reportedly observed @entity18 sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old			0
" the assistant reported the incident to @entity151 , who in turn alerted athletic director @entity24 , @entity11 said			0
" it was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw , but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the grand jury report			0
regardless , it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving mr. @entity18			0
as coach @entity18 was retired from our coaching staff at that time , i referred the matter to university administrators , " @entity151 said			2
but instead of reporting the incident to authorities , @entity24 and @entity90 banned @entity18 from having children from @entity164 visit the football building , @entity11 said			0

" assertions by @entity90 that the allegations concerning @entity18 were ' not that serious ' and that he and @entity24 ' had no indication that a crime had occurred ' were in direct contradiction to other testimony and constituted perjury , " @entity11 wrote			2
in all , the grand jury identified eight boys , ranging in age from about 8 to 14 , who were the targets of similar sexual advances or assaults by @entity18 from 1994 to 2009			1
