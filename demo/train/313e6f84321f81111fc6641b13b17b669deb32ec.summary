the @entity0 is considering under what circumstances it will recommend president @entity2 authorize the use of a missile - equipped drone to kill the leader of @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 has learned			1
any such mission to kill @entity9 would have to be approved by @entity2 , according to several defense officials @entity10 has spoken to at length			1
all of the officials have direct knowledge of the intelligence gathering efforts in @entity7 , but declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information			0
" he is a person of great interest to us , " one defense official told @entity10			0
if the @entity25 military were to recommend a drone strike against @entity27 , there would have to be specific and detailed intelligence showing his location at the moment of a strike and intelligence to assure that civilians would not be at risk			1
in order to launch a kill mission , the @entity25 has to demonstrate the target poses a threat to the @entity25 @entity42 's @entity41 organization does threaten the @entity25 embassy and @entity25 citizens in @entity7 , according to @entity25 officials			1
it is also possible the @entity25 could turn the information over to the @entity7 government for it to conduct a capture or kill mission against the @entity41 leader on its own			1
another point of consideration would be the impact of a @entity25 strike on the situation in @entity7 and whether the @entity25 would be seen by @entity57 as siding with the @entity59 - led government			2
@entity42 already has a $ 10 million bounty on his head from the @entity25 government 's @entity65 program , which offers multi-million dollar rewards for information leading to the capture of certain high value terrorists around the world			1
last week , @entity27 made a very public appearance at a prominent mosque in northern @entity7			0
eyewitnesses said he drove up to the mosque in a large convoy and remained surrounded by civilians			0
but @entity25 officials said capturing @entity27 would be difficult because the @entity25 military does not have combat troops on the ground in either @entity7 or @entity8 , where @entity27 and @entity41 are known to operate			1
in addition , any covert capture mission by @entity25 special forces or law enforcement inside @entity7 could be seen as violating @entity7 's sovereignty , though such a mission remains possible			2
that means @entity27 is essentially on a @entity25 " kill list " even though such a list in @entity8 and @entity7 has never been openly acknowledged			2
under @entity25 policy , lethal drone attacks are generally authorized when there is no reasonable possibility of capturing a suspect			2
the possibility comes as part of the @entity25 military effort to gather intelligence on so - called " high value targets " in @entity7 and continues to collect intelligence for targeting airstrikes in @entity7			0
the targets fall into three categories , the officials said			0
they include information for striking " high value targets " like @entity27 ; protection of key infrastructure such as the @entity107 ; and blunting major @entity41 offensives against @entity109			2
airstrikes by either drones or manned aircraft would have to be approved by the president			0
there are also electronic intercepts being conducted , according to one @entity25 official			0
in recent days the @entity25 military has again increased its reconnaissance missions over @entity7 from the 30 missions a day it was conducting			0
" it 's up around 50 right now			0
and it 's stayed there for a good many days , " according to rear adm. @entity122 , @entity0 press secretary			1
who is the @entity41 ? @entity25 official : ' no reason to doubt ' video 's authenticity of @entity27			1

@entity0 considering when to recommend authorizing drone strike agains @entity41 leader
any mission to kill @entity41 leader @entity9 would need @entity2 's approval
@entity42 has $ 10 million bounty on his head through @entity139 program
