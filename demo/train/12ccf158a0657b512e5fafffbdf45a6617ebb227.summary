-- when the time came to grab that killer @entity5 fireworks photo , @entity2 was ready			1
" it 's taken me years to get a good shot , " the @entity7 native explained			1
" i very much planned for it			0
i studied up on how to shoot fireworks , read photographer blogs and got to know my equipment			1
" @entity2 's dedication paid off			1
in 2011 , she captured a frame - worthy shot of several colorful fireworks exploding above @entity7 's @entity18 , their glow reflecting off of the lake below			1
the result is stunning ; a fitting memory of a lovely day that perfectly encapsulates all that is great about the holiday celebration			1
the @entity5 honors @entity28 's @entity5 , when the nation declared independence from @entity31 in 1776			1
a national holiday , it 's often marked with glorious parades , barbecues , parties and , of course , fireworks			1
as part of @entity0 's series celebrating the biggest , boldest and most spectacular celebrations across the world , we asked people to send in their best @entity5 images , and to give tips on how to capture the perfect fireworks photo			1
here are some handy hints			0
use a tripod one thing is for sure with fireworks pictures -- you do n't want them blurry			1
so use a tripod to keep everything steady , photographers say			0
" i love taking [ pictures of ] fireworks [ but ] it 's quite tricky , " said @entity7 - based photographer @entity57 , who snapped a great shot at a @entity5 fireworks display in @entity60 , @entity7 , in 2011			1
" one absolutely needs a tripod , since you will have to use a slow shutter to get the trails			0
" his sentiment is echoed by professional photographer @entity69 , who has fond memories of spectacular fireworks competitions between families in his neighborhood in @entity74			1
he also has some great tips for those wanting that iconic @entity5 shot			1
" the main requirement is a tripod , i use a sandbag or some other heavy object to make sure there is no tripod shake , " he said			0
" [ also ] , long exposures -- up to 10 seconds -- are required			1
i generally use an f - stop of f / 11 to f / 16 and a shutter speed of two to 10 seconds			0
the longer exposures will also give you time for multiple reports to be visible			0
" capture that key moment @entity91 of @entity92 knew what he wanted for his @entity5 shot last year -- and he was n't going to let anything , not even pesky mosquitoes , get in the way			1
his great photo captures the moment his nephew launched a bottle rocket across one of @entity92 's many lakes , @entity103			2
" we did it in one take and then ran away because the mosquitoes were eating us alive , " he remembered with a laugh			0
in a similar vein , @entity108 from @entity109 , @entity110 , captured a memorable photo on july 4 , 2009 , of his sister , her now - husband and four of her college friends drawing " july 4 " using sparklers , with help from a tripod and remote trigger release			0
he says despite the challenges -- each sparkler - holder had to draw a character backwards -- they nailed the photo on the first try			2
the end result was worth the careful planning			0
" i think a lot of people thought it was photoshopped , " he said			0
then take some more it does n't always take a professional camera to get a great shot , but it does require patience			2
@entity137 photographed a spectacular fireworks display in 2010 in @entity139 , @entity7 , on the @entity141 studio lot			2
she used a @entity142 which , to her surprise , had a " fireworks " setting			2
her advice for those keen to capture great shots is simple : " with fireworks , you never know what to expect , so keep on clicking ! " she said			1
" everything i photograph is usually straight from the hip , not planned			0
and i end up usually surprised myself			0
" her advice was echoed by @entity154 from @entity155 , @entity156 , who captured her own stunning images from a celebration in nearby @entity160			2
" i usually shoot until a get one i like , " she shared			0
" experiment with different settings and see what you get			0
" enjoy yourself ! " a day off from work for many , picnics , maybe some time at the pool or lake , and of course , at the end of the day , sonic booms followed by shimmering , multi-colored fire bringing ' oohs ' and ' aahs ' from young and old			2
what 's not to like ? " @entity154 asked			2
the point is -- make it fun			2
too much time worrying about your shot means you wo n't get the chance to enjoy the celebration			1
so make sure you , well , celebrate			0
you could do worse than take a leaf from @entity186 's book			0
the @entity188 resident took some stunning shots over the city bay in 2011			0
he said the beautiful display reminded him of how glorious his city -- and country -- were			0
