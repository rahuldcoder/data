-- tech visionary @entity1 understood better than anyone the impulse to believe that technology can solve our most complex societal problems			1
" unfortunately it just ai n't so , " he said			1
" we need to attack these things at the root , which is people and how much freedom we give people			0
... i wish it was as simple as giving it over to the computer			0
" that 's certainly true when it comes to education , particularly in impoverished communities			1
as a founder of two organizations that recruit top college graduates to expand educational opportunity , i 've spent a lot of time examining what 's at work in successful classrooms and schools over the past two decades			0
in every classroom where students are excelling against the odds , there 's a teacher who 's empowered her students to work hard to realize their potential			1
whenever i ask the leaders of successful schools their secret , the answer is almost always the same : people , people , people			0
they are obsessed with recruiting and developing the best teams			0
research confirms that great teachers change lives			1
students with one highly effective elementary school teacher are more likely to go to college , less likely to become pregnant as teens and earn tens of thousands more over their lifetimes			1
faced with the choice between giving every child in a school his or her own laptop or putting 30 of them in a classroom with one exceptional teacher , there 's no question which is the better investment			1
so it 's disappointing to see more and more people herald technology as an educational panacea while dismissing the indispensable role of people			0
in a recent article on this site , @entity68 asked whether we 'd be better off ditching teachers , giving kids computers and leaving them to their own devices to teach themselves and each other			1
the idea is based on the work of @entity78 , an education professor who set up an experiment in @entity80 where he gave children in the slums access to a " computer in the wall " and found that without guidance , they were soon using it to learn on their own			1
@entity68 's piece could leave the impression that teachers are obsolete and that their main function is to enforce discipline and administer tests			1
( instead of spending money on teachers , @entity93 recruits cheerleading " grannies , " older women from the @entity97 who offer the kids words of praise and encouragement via @entity101			1
) the idea that computers can ever replace teachers and schools reveals a deep lack of understanding about the role leadership plays in student success			1
when @entity113 started teaching ninth and 10th grades at an all - girls school in @entity116 , her students were performing four years behind grade level and many considered themselves nalaiq ( incapable )			1
she set a mission that each of her girls would gain the skills and self - confidence to become contributing members of society			0
" my first task was to build a sense of responsibility in the girls towards their own learning and success , which would be achieved by collaborating with other members of the class and the community at large , " she says			0
today , here students are not only thriving academically , they are empowered and independent young women			0
now , i 'm no @entity138			0
technology has enormous potential to address educational needs more efficiently , help teachers improve their performance and enrich and individualize student learning			1
indeed , in places such as @entity80 that face massive underserved populations and a shortage of qualified teachers , it 's hard to imagine making a dent without leveraging technology in a big way			2
but we must be wary of concluding that we should focus our energy on technology rather than people			0
computers can not create a culture of excellence and push students to meet high expectations			2
computers can not visit students ' homes to get to know their families and engage them in their progress			2
computers can not raise money and organize college visits to show students who have never left their communities what they 're working toward			2
technology is a tool , not a silver bullet			0
and like all tools , it can be helpful or harmful depending on how we use them			0
@entity180 , a high - performing charter network that serves low - income students in @entity182 , uses technology to enhance -- not replace -- the work that teachers are doing			2
students spend up to two hours a day in a computer learning lab mastering basic math and reading skills through exercises and puzzles , freeing up teachers to spend their time on advanced skills and concepts			2
the schools invest the money they save through computer learning back into teacher salaries and coaching			2
at @entity180 , technology strengthens the personal ties between students , parents and teachers that are the key to its success			2
children growing up in poverty need all the support and nurturing from adults that they can get			0
if we want a real revolution in education , we should make an all - out effort to attract and keep our best people in our schools			1
technology can be a powerful force in that effort when guided by leaders who understand what students and teachers need to do their best			2
we ca n't outsource the human connections at the heart of the learning experience			0
transforming the lives and learning of our children will take more than machines			0
it will take the best of our human resources			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

@entity237 : even @entity1 realized computers could n't solves societal problems
she says in education , teachers make the *difference* when kids excel against the odds
a @entity0 article presented idea that kids could learn mainly with computers
she says research shows kids with one effective grade school teacher achieve on many levels
