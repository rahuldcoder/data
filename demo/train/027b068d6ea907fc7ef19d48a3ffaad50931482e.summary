@entity0 , @entity1 -- unlike many other boys his age , 17 - year - old @entity3 wakes up excited to go to class each day			2
" there is no other place like this , " he says , as he finishes up breakfast in his school 's basement cafeteria			2
@entity3 is talking about his @entity14 school outside @entity1 's @entity15 , known simply as @entity16			1
the boys ' school not only focuses on the study of @entity20			1
it 's one of a few @entity14 nationwide that combines religious teaching with a focus on students with special learning needs			1
the school aims to help kids who are " stuck in the middle " -- who ca n't keep up with the pace of regular schools , but have n't completely given up either			1
" [ it 's ] a place for kids that are struggling everywhere else , " the school 's director , rabbi @entity33 , said			1
" there was n't ever a place for those kids			1
" students come from all over the country to attend this boarding school , including many from low - income households			1
" we wanted to try and help those kids out there that need more attention , " @entity33 said , sitting in his office after just returning with the students from a twice weekly hockey trip to the local ice rink			1
since opening in 2006 , the school has seen its enrollment double from its inaugural class of 18 students			1
@entity3 , now in 11th grade , feels more at home here than he did at his previous @entity14 in his hometown of @entity59 , @entity60			1
" they told me i was a weak learner , " he said			0
but he says at @entity16 he excels because of the different pace of teaching			1
@entity65 , a ninth - grader from @entity66 , @entity67 , says he struggles with attention deficit disorder ( @entity69 ) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity71 )			0
" in another school , if you ca n't keep up with the learning , they 'll tell you ... ' we 're going to have to suspend you , ' " @entity65 said			1
he says the school 's dedicated time for physical education -- another unique quality of this @entity14 -- makes it easier for him to sit through classes			1
" it makes you feel like people care , " he said			0
" it 's just -- you 're wanted			0
you 're part of everybody			0
" @entity87 , whose son attends the school , says he would be in a much different situation if it were n't for the school			1
" they are just like a family , which , to me , is very important , " she said			0
" because even though he is a big boy , he still needs a lot of attention			0
" the school 's co-founder rabbi @entity100 calls @entity16 a place where " there 's a little bit less of the stress in learning , a little bit more relaxed in academics			1
" " we want to know how you are doing -- not just what your test scores look like , " @entity100 said			0
while the school may be unique in many ways , it 's still a functioning business			2
the rough economy has n't passed by unnoticed			2
@entity33 acknowledges they 've had difficulty making mortgage payments this past year			1
if they ca n't come up with the remainder of the building 's cost in cash or five - year pledges by may 15 -- about $ 500,000 -- they 'll be forced out			1
" we 're talking about these kids ' home and the future kids that are going to come here , " @entity33 said			2
" i believe that with @entity134 's help , the best case scenario is going to occur			0
" while this year the school has set tuition at more than $ 18,000 a year , it typically operates with a " pay what you can " mentality			1
but this is the first time since the school opened four years ago that not one of the 36 enrolled students has been able to come up with the full amount			2
@entity33 blames a combination of factors			0
" throughout last year , lots of our parents lost their jobs , " @entity33 said , adding that they also " lost donations due to the economy , some large			0
" regardless , students and faculty are optimistic			2
" what 'd they say about @entity158 ? too big too fold			0
we 're not as big as @entity158 -- yet			0
but we 're too important , " @entity100 said			0
" to see the kids we 're helping , there is no way in my mind that this wo n't continue , " rabbi @entity33 said			2
" @entity134 is not that cynical			0
" @entity3 says without this school , he 'll likely end up moving to @entity166 where his family lives now			2
that means he 'd have to join the @entity166 army after his 18th birthday			0
but @entity65 offers a reassuring assessment : " someone will pull us through , " he said			0
" we 're going to keep going on like this for many more years , and one day maybe i can send my children here			0
