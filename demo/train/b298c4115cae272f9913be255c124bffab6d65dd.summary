-- baseball writers balked at naming any new players to the sport 's @entity3 on wednesday , with none of the 37 eligible players drawing enough votes for a ticket to @entity3			1
the 2013 ballot marked the first year of eligibility for several players who have been named in the probes of performance - enhancing drug use in the major leagues , including all - time home run champ @entity15 and seven - time @entity17 winner @entity16			1
it 's only the eighth time that no player received the 75 % support needed to enter the @entity3 , and several of the voters said the results reflected the @entity24 's ambivalence about the sport 's " steroid era			1
" " this is really a statement on an era , and it 's really a sad day for baseball , " @entity24 voter @entity27 told the sport 's in - house @entity28			1
@entity27 said he expected the writers who choose hall members would " basically split " on @entity15 and @entity16 , " and we 're not split			1
it was two - thirds to one - third against			0
" the concerns about players who were linked to steroids " has hurt some of the clean guys " as well , @entity27 said			1
the head of the players ' union , @entity42 , said the decision was unfair			2
" to ignore the historic accomplishments of @entity15 and @entity16 , for example , is hard to justify , " he said			1
" moreover , to penalize players exonerated in legal proceedings , and others never even implicated , is simply unfair			2
the @entity3 is supposed to be for the best players to have ever played the game			1
" @entity54 baseball writer @entity53 said it would n't matter if a player was a @entity3 caliber player before baseball had its steroid use problems			1
" based on your career win totals or home run totals , that does n't give you the green light then to go ahead and cheat the game and those who played it , ( making it ) an unfair game			2
" the top vote - getter on the 2013 ballot was longtime @entity75 second baseman @entity74 , who racked up more than 3,000 hits in a two - decade career			1
@entity74 received 68 % of the vote , falling 39 votes short of election , @entity3 president @entity78 announced			1
@entity16 has denied using performance - enhancing drugs , and in 2012 , a federal jury acquitted him of lying to @entity84 during an investigation of steroid use			1
@entity15 , who topped @entity88 's home run mark in 2007 , was sentenced to two years of probation and 30 days of house arrest for obstruction of justice in another federal probe ; he also has denied using performance - enhancing drugs			2
other players on the ballot who were linked to the use of performance - enhancing drugs over the past two decades included @entity100 , the @entity102 slugger who broke the sport 's single - season home run record in 1998 ; the @entity106 ' @entity105 , @entity100 's major rival in that season - long chase ; and four - time all - star @entity108			2
in 2010 , @entity100 admitted to using steroids during his record - breaking season			2
@entity108 was once slapped with a suspension after a positive drug test but denied using any banned substances			0
@entity105 denied using steroids during a congressional hearing but did not respond to requests for an interview by staffers for former sen. @entity119 , who led a probe of steroid use in the major leagues in 2007			0
fans ' reactions were mixed			0
" i think it 's utter nonsense , " said @entity125 , an @entity126 it consultant			0
" i think if you 're going to be paid tens of millions of dollars a year , you 're going to do what you need to do to stay at the top of your game			0
and the average @entity133 gets that			0
and their owners demand that			0
" opinion : going after @entity16 was stupid but @entity139 , who commented on the @entity3 's @entity141 page , said the voters got it right			1
" i think people confuse the @entity145 with getting a plaque from the @entity24 ( @entity147 ) of @entity148 , " he wrote			0
" all the steroid cheaters ( specifically @entity150 , @entity16 , @entity100 , @entity105 and @entity108 , etc. ) have their accomplishments represented in the @entity3			1
so the history of baseball , and their history in baseball , is represented			0
however , we do not need to honor these cheaters and lawbreakers with a plaque			0
" @entity161 , a @entity102 fan who was hanging out at @entity162 in @entity163 , @entity164 , said he thought some of those on the ballot were punished for the supposed actions of another			0
" the fact that nobody got inducted is kind of like the sports writers were making a point out of @entity15 , " he said			2
like @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity105 was in his first year of eligibility for the @entity3			1
@entity100 was on the ballot for a seventh time and @entity108 , a third			0
opinion : allow doping in sport former pitcher @entity180 received 67.7 % of the vote			2
@entity180 , who won 254 games in his career , gets one more crack next year , as players are eligible for 15 ballots , beginning five years after they retire			0
one of the players who wo n't be on next year 's ballot is @entity189 , a two - time @entity190 who spent most of his career with the @entity191			1
the fact that no one was voted in this year could muddle the ballot for 2014 , when pitchers @entity196 and @entity197 will be added to the ballot , as will slugger @entity199			0
three people will be inducted into the @entity3 on july 28			2
in december a special panel that looks at people whose career ended before 1947 voted in @entity204 , the @entity206 owner who bought @entity208 's contract in 1919 ; former umpire @entity209 ; and @entity210 , a catcher in the 19th century			0
