@entity0 -- in the broader frame , @entity3 's decision to stand again as @entity5 president is no big surprise			1
@entity8 returns , though the idea of @entity10 ( @entity11 ) becoming prime minister may not work out for long			0
sure , the timing was unexpected			0
there were good reasons for making the decision later -- last time around @entity11 was revealed as @entity3 's choice for president only after the parliamentary ( duma ) elections in december 2007			1
@entity11 now becomes an early lame duck -- the @entity21 has not dealt with that problem simply by saying he will be prime minister under @entity3			2
by making the announcement before the @entity25 elections , @entity3 has guaranteed a majority for his new ' " @entity27 " -- but that will also create problems			2
@entity5 voters quickly cottoned on to the fact that the old @entity33 party was just a roadblock : it could stop opponents winning elections , but had no role in government or in the generation of policy or strategic thinking			1
the corporatist behemoth @entity27 will be even worse			0
@entity5 has a " managed democracy , " but the campaign for the presidential elections next march will now be even longer , and in a long campaign not everything can be easily managed			2
comment : @entity3 and @entity11 , trading places there are other obvious downsides , even once the timing issue is out of the way			2
@entity56 leaders who invested time and political capital in engaging @entity11 will be asking loudly what the interregnum was all about			0
the idea of a @entity21 - approved but reformist new liberal party has been squashed			0
so have the rumors that @entity5 's liberal conscience and enforcer of fiscal discipline , finance minister @entity64 , would be the next prime minister			2
but @entity64 would have been a much better choice than an ineffective @entity11 , and could have taken @entity5 back to the long - forgotten era of real reform when @entity3 first came to power in the early 2000s -- before the @entity75 affair in 2003 and the oil price explosion that sucked the life out of the reform impulse			1
what does @entity64 do now to stop the markets freaking out ? and how long will the mild - mannered @entity11 really last as @entity82 , given that he is unlikely to transform himself overnight into a fire - breathing ceo ? the @entity5 government ca n't be run on @entity84			1
then there are much bigger strategic questions			0
will @entity3 2.0 be any different from @entity87 ? can @entity3 dismantle @entity88 ? @entity3 always hoped the history books would treat him well , which is why he chooses court historians to write them ; but even many of the supposed achievements of his first two terms of office ( 2000 - 08 ) , such as @entity5 's much - vaunted " stability , " the restoration of state authority and victory in @entity94 , may now be under threat if @entity3 comes back in much more difficult economic circumstances and with real anarchy looming in @entity5 's @entity102 " internal abroad			1
" even stagnation is not an easy option			0
will @entity3 2.0 be able to stop the growing torrent of capital flight out of @entity5 , which reached $ 21 billion in the first quarter of 2011 ? @entity3 's ideologue @entity109 once coined the term " offshore aristocracy ' " to abuse the " cosmopolitan " oligarchs and @entity56 advisers of the @entity115 era ; but this is precisely what @entity3 's oligarchy has become			1
the ruling elite is not investing at home -- many of them do n't even live in @entity5			2
and capital flight is no longer just for oligarchs , as genuine entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises ( @entity127 ) despair of red tape and corruption			1
will @entity3 be able to curb the bloated state that has grown so unwieldy under oil money ? the budget only balances at an ever higher oil price -- currently reckoned to be about $ 125 a barrel			1
how high will the necessary price be in a few years ? @entity3 has so far failed to build a new narrative			2
the same old guys still sit beside him			0
even his old image as the " good tsar " reigning in the " bad boyars " is suspect			0
@entity3 has not cleansed the stables , and the oligarchs close to him may get bolder and more brazen once he comes back to power			0
@entity3 's favorite foreign policy initiatives will be pushed further forward , like the idea of a customs union with @entity147 and @entity148 , with @entity149 under pressure to join			1
if @entity152 's president @entity151 " does a @entity3 " and makes himself prime minister after his second term runs out in january 2013 , @entity151 and @entity3 could then be squaring off for years			1
the ugly youth group @entity156 and its skinhead hinterland will still be around			0
periodically , @entity3 's pr machine has pushed out the idea that he is tired of office and looking forward to retirement			1
we can now put that myth to rest			0
he has now guaranteed himself another six or even 12 years of hyperactivity , with an overflowing in - tray .			0

@entity3 's decision to stand again as @entity5 president is no big surprise , says commentator
@entity174 says markets and investors are unlikely to be *impressed* by move
he asks : can @entity3 stop capital flight out of @entity5 ; guarantee stability in @entity182
and will @entity3 be able to curb bloated state that has grown unwieldy under oil money ?
