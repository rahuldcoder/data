we 're used to seeing police dashboard videos of speeders , car accidents or worse			2
but the @entity6 in @entity7 is turning the camera on its force to show that police are human , too -- and sometimes they just want to shake , shake , shake , shake , shake			1
a dashcam video of @entity16 cpl. @entity15 cruising in his police vehicle and grooving to @entity19 's " @entity18 " was an instant hit on friday			1
the video was shared nearly 2,000 times in less than 24 hours from the department 's @entity24 page and drew positive feedback from around the world			2
the goal of the video is to show a different side of police to counter negative perceptions of law enforcement , @entity29 cpl. @entity28 said			1
" we 're trying to humanize police officers			2
people tend to look at us as robots with uniforms and gun belts so we wanted to a show a lighter side of our force , " he said			1
" i think it 's important for people to see police in that light			0
" the video was shot as part of the @entity6 's social media community outreach			1
to celebrate reaching 10,000 @entity24 followers , the department launched a series called " @entity56 , " debuting with @entity15 's rendition of " @entity18			1
" @entity28 suggested " @entity18 " and @entity15 was more than happy to oblige			2
he already knew the words , thanks to his 10 - year - old daughter , a @entity19 fan			0
" when you drive around in a car all the time listening to @entity19 you get to know all the words and like her songs , " the 19 - year veteran of the force told @entity1			0
in the video , @entity15 appears to pause periodically for passing vehicles			0
in reality , the video was shot in two takes in a secluded parking lot in @entity72			0
" it was fun thing , a nice thing to do with everything that 's going on with police			0
with all the negative publicity it 's nice to show a positive side of police , " he said			1
judging by the response so far , he thinks it 's working			0
" i think people are liking the fact of seeing police in a different view			0
