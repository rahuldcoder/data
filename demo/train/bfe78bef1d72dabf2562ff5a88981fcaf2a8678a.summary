house speaker @entity0 warned president @entity1 in person friday that signing an executive order overhauling immigration laws would spoil their chances of cooperating on other issues in the future			1
@entity0 , senate republican leader @entity9 and other congressional leaders met with @entity1 for a two - hour lunch at the @entity12 , where @entity0 repeated the warning he 'd issued after @entity14 seized control of both chambers in tuesday 's midterm elections			2
sources said immigration reform was the focus of a 30 - minute discussion during the lunch			0
" the speaker warned that unilateral action by the president on executive amnesty will erase any chances of doing immigration reform and will also make it harder for @entity28 and the @entity12 to work together successfully on other areas where there might otherwise be common ground , " @entity0 's office said of the lunch			1
he and other congressional leaders did n't talk to reporters as they left the @entity12			0
but the @entity12 said in a readout of the lunch that @entity1 " reiterated his commitment to taking action on immigration reform in light of the @entity12 's inability to pass a comprehensive bill			1
" @entity40 tweets @entity1 : get @entity12 to vote on immigration @entity1 had already repeated his pledge to sign an executive order on immigration in the coming months during a news conference this week -- and @entity0 and @entity46 separately said doing so would " @entity47 " and complicate the @entity12 's chances of getting @entity28 on board with any of its other goals			1
@entity0 's message came the same day that @entity53 chairman @entity52 said that @entity1 's " nuclear threat " of an executive order on immigration would cause the @entity14 to back away from supporting the type of comprehensive reform that he 'd said looked key to the party 's survival just two years ago			1
immigration activists hope they do n't get burned by @entity1 @entity52 blasted @entity1 for politicizing the issue , saying he 's caused @entity14 to lose interest in advancing a measure that would hand undocumented workers a pathway to citizenship before first improving security on the @entity70 border with @entity71			2
and he said @entity1 would be " throwing a barrel of kerosene " on already - inflamed tensions with congressional @entity14 if he goes ahead with " executive amnesty			0
" " what i think [ @entity1 has ] done is unify the country and the electorate around one big principle , and that 's that we need to secure the border , " @entity52 said at a breakfast hosted by the @entity77			0
" he has created a situation that i think may have not have existed before that episode that has galvanized the country [ to ] a place where i do n't believe most people are interested in comprehensive immigration reform unless they are convinced that the border is secure , " he said			0
" and i think it 's because of the president 's haphazard political game that 's created an environment that will not allow the legislation to move forward unless people can be convinced that that border is secure			0
and that 's where we 've come			0
" opinion : @entity1 , @entity14 , get going on immigration reform @entity52 's stance was a departure from an @entity53 - commissioned " autopsy report " that came in the wake of @entity1 's re-election in 2012			1
that report called on @entity14 to support comprehensive immigration reform legislation , warning that otherwise , the party could alienate the rapidly - growing @entity110 electorate			2
he said most republicans agree that immigration reform ultimately must happen			0
" however , what we 've seen happen over the last several months is that the president has been using people as political pawns and lying to people when it comes to immigration reform , " @entity52 said .			1
