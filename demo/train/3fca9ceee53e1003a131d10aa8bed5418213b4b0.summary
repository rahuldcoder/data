from the outside , @entity1 's @entity0 looks just like any other high security operation			1
and indeed , behind the barbed wire and electronic fence are piles of golden blocks			0
but they are not made of precious metal -- rather , they are ageing wheels of parmesan cheese			1
as i walk inside , i am hit by the pungent smell and then , by the size of the vaults			1
row after row , stacked up twenty shelves high , are 430,000 parmesan wheels			0
they 're worth up to 190 million euros			0
the wheels are stored here as part of a cash - for - cheese loan that started with @entity0 bank , but dates back to the @entity26 era			1

it charges between 3 % to 5 % interest , depending on the quality of the cheese , and a fee for making sure the cheese matures properly in their air - conditioned , humidified vault			1
this mechanism ensures that in the two years it takes the cheese to mature , credit keeps flowing			1
in these tough economic times , this allows producers to feed their cattle , pay their staff ...			2
if for whatever reason , the cheese producer defaults on the loan , the bank has the cheese to sell on			1

they clean it , turn it , hammer it , prick it and from time to time even taste certain batches			2
@entity70 , an expert taster with the @entity73 consortium , tells me each batch has to meet strict criteria			0
if it does n't , the cheese is downgraded , the @entity73 imprint scraped off and then it 's sold simply as @entity1 cheese			1

right now , they have their own vault on site , financed by the bank			2
from time to time , they still use the bigger @entity0 vault			0
it 's a strategy that has paid off			0
every day , they make thirty two wheels of @entity73 , adding up to almost twelve - thousand wheels a year			2

not even the early hours , the arduous work and the 40 kilo wheels can kill his dream			0
" it is not hard work			0
it 's a strong passion for me and for us , " he said			0
it 's a passion as strong as the cheese itself , backed by a bank that takes a mature attitude to lending .			1
