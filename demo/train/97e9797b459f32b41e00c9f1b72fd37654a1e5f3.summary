-- the @entity2 has been reinstated to the 2011 @entity4 calendar after unrest in the @entity7 kingdom forced its cancellation earlier in the year , officials announced friday			1
the race , which had been scheduled to be the opening race of the elite motorsport season on march 13 , was canceled in february			1
the @entity13 crown prince informed @entity4 chief @entity14 of the decision by telephone after days of violent clashes			1
@entity18 subsequently hosted the opening event two weeks later than scheduled			2
the race in @entity13 is now scheduled for october 28 - 30 , meaning that the inaugural @entity21 @entity2 will be shifted from that date to become the final race of the season after @entity25 ( november 25 - 27 )			1
the @entity21 event will now take place on december 9 - 11 , according to the official @entity4 web site			1
should @entity4 take the risk of racing in @entity13 ? " this is welcome news for all of @entity13 , " chairman of the host circuit @entity33 said in a statement friday			1
" as a country we have faced a difficult time , but stability has returned ; with businesses operating close to normal , the @entity40 lifted and countries removing travel restrictions			2
" collectively , we are in the process of addressing issues of national and international concern , and learning lessons from the recent past			0
by the time the @entity2 arrives we will be able to remind the world about @entity13 at its best			1
" @entity33 said the race " attracts 100,000 visitors , supports 3,000 jobs and generates around $ 500 million of economic benefit			2
its positive effect will be felt throughout the country			0
" @entity14 's @entity58 and motorsport 's world governing body , the @entity62 , confirmed the announcement on friday			1
@entity62 president @entity64 and vice-president @entity65 visited @entity13 on tuesday to assess the situation , meeting government and motor racing officials as well as as other national and international organizations including the @entity70			1
" it should be noted that the recent announcement by the @entity74 has established a political dialogue and reconciliation process , " the @entity62 said in a statement on its web site			0
" after considering all the factors and taking into consideration all stakeholders ' concerns , the @entity77 ( @entity78 ) unanimously agreed to reinstate the @entity2			0
" however , the news has been cautiously received by leading team @entity84 , which won both driver and manufacturer world titles last season and is again on top in 2011 with @entity89 a dominant force on the grid			2
" @entity84 has acknowledged the @entity77 's decision to go ahead with the @entity97 , " the @entity94 - based @entity93 team said in a statement			0
" we will go through the correct channels and discuss this decision within the appropriate forum with the other @entity4 teams and our fellow @entity104 members			2
" @entity84 has been targeted by activist group @entity105 , which launched an online petition asking the team and the 11 others in @entity4 to boycott @entity13			1
" @entity4 's decision is a kick in the teeth for the @entity13 people , " campaign director @entity108 said in quotes reported by the @entity94 @entity110 , which said former @entity4 world champion @entity111 was among the 340,000 - plus signatories			1
the @entity117 also expressed its anger at the @entity62 's decision , and warned that there would be further protests on the day of the race			2
" they have taken the decision on the day two people were buried today : one woman who died from shock from a sound bomb , and one man who died today after being attacked in march , " its president @entity123 told @entity0			0
" that @entity4 took this decision without thinking about the human rights in this country , this shows to many organizations that their interests have more value to them than humanity			2
" from our side we will see how on that day we will get the whole world to know what is happening here			0
already there are pages on @entity146 calling it ( the day of the grand prix ) a @entity149			1
" i will urge all the drivers , journalists , everyone , to stay in solidarity with us by not going to this event			0
this will be the sport of the oppressor 's regime			0
a huge number of the staff of @entity161 has been detained , jailed and tortured			0
none of this is reported			0
" on wednesday , @entity13 lifted the state of emergency laws that had facilitated the restriction of political leaders and journalists , but at the same time the government continued its crackdown on the country 's major @entity171 political opposition movement and stifled the latest street protests			1
it filed charges against four top opposition leaders in a move that could weaken the country 's @entity178 party , according to two opposition sources			0
this came as @entity182 appealed for dialogue , saying that talks with opposition groups are scheduled to begin in july			0
the lifting of the emergency laws , imposed in mid-march , is thought to be an effort to signal an end to months of civil unrest stemming from the @entity191 , a wave of anti-government demonstrations that started in @entity193 and have since roiled several countries in the @entity195 and @entity196 , including @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity13			1
but the announcement by the country 's @entity201 followed one from the justice ministry the day before warning against " any type of activities that could affect the security or harm the national peace and safety			0
" still , @entity33 on friday said : " the @entity2 has always been a source of national pride and it is an event than transcends politics			0
not only does it receive strong support from the government , but also from all major parties in @entity13 , including our largest opposition group , @entity178 , who yesterday endorsed both the @entity221 and motor - racing in @entity13			2
