@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is a game most @entity4 play in their basements			2
but competitive table tennis is a different story			1
in fact , it 's an @entity10 sport , and the @entity4 has a bright , new star representing @entity12 in @entity13 : 16 - year - old @entity11			1
@entity11 's parents , @entity15 and @entity16 , immigrants to the @entity4 , play table tennis			1
when her mother could n't find a baby sitter , she brought a then 7 - year - old @entity19 along with her when playing at table tennis clubs			1
it was there that @entity11 discovered her love for the sport and her talent			1
" i love table tennis , and i love playing			1
i love to practice so i just kept practicing and there were tournaments along the way , but it just kind of happened gradually , " said @entity11			1
@entity31 : get involved with the @entity10 " i never thought for one minute : ' ok , i am just going to dedicate my life to table tennis			1
' i really love it , and i 'm really passionate about it so i just keep wanting to do it			0
" while other elite athletes focus solely on their sport and winning @entity10 gold , @entity11 is a junior at @entity40 in @entity0 with college on the horizon			2
she aspires to attend @entity43			0
@entity11 understands that table tennis is not as popular other @entity10 sports and does n't bring in the same kind of endorsements and money			1
she must split her focus between athletics and academics			0
to achieve success on the table and in the classroom , @entity11 has a regimented schedule			1
" i wake up at around 7 a.m. i 'll go practice serves for half an hour , and then i 'll start getting ready for school			0
my dad will drive me to school			0
after my classes , he 'll pick me up with lunch and he 'll drive me to a nearby club			0
" and after i eat my lunch i 'll usually take a nap in the car			0
and once i get there , at the club , i 'll train for two to three hours and he 'll drive me to another club and there i 'll play another two hours , then i 'll come home , eat dinner , do homework , and i 'll finally get to sleep , " @entity11 said			2
@entity75 names two women to @entity10 team all of the practice is necessary as @entity11 notes her sport goes well beyond a friendly game of ping - pong			2
" i think ping - pong is the kind of game that everyone loves to play			0
a lot of people have their table in their basement at home , and they just play around for fun but competitive table tennis is really different			1
" it 's not just about your arm , but you have to move your legs so much , it can be really tiring and when you 're actually playing a match , it 's just like a chess game			0
you have to beat the opponent mentally while they 're trying to change their strategies , " she said			0
@entity11 's made several sacrifices to get her to her first @entity10 , such as adjusting her diet			2
" i 've had to give up a lot of food for table tennis			1
i really love to eat , and i love to eat anything unhealthy , anything that will give you a heart attack , those are my foods , so i 've had to give up a lot of those in order to maintain a good athletic shape			0
" with her intense schedule , @entity11 has also sacrificed time hanging out with friends , but she 's also gained a notable new friend : @entity122			1
she met @entity122 when she was 9 on @entity122 's 75th birthday			1
@entity122 received a table tennis lesson as a gift , and the local coach thought it be fun to bring a young phenom along to assist in the lesson			1
@entity11 made such an impression on @entity122 that he remains one of her biggest fans			1
@entity122 offers her advice , encouragement and is a constant cheerleader , even watching her matches online from his office			1
" @entity138 has just been so supportive of me			0
when i was playing the finals of the @entity10 trials , he was there in his office , cheering for me , and everyone in his office did n't know what was going on			0
so that was really funny , " @entity11 said			2
she is appreciative of this special bond with @entity122 , and it 's clear the influence he 's had on her			2
she hopes to major in business in college			0
but she says the best advice he 's given her was n't something he said but rather something she learned by example			2
" he 's just been so humble and just so down to earth , and i think that 's really admirable , and i really want to be like that			0
" as she excitedly heads off to @entity13 , @entity11 remains grounded in what her role is			2
she takes representing her country very seriously , but she also knows she bears a responsibility as a role model			2
" i would just tell people to always fight for their dreams and just try really , really hard to go for it			1
because when i was 8 years old , i had a dream of making the @entity10 one day			0
i wrote this down on a little piece of paper , and i rolled it up and i put it in this little box			0
... i convinced myself if i opened that piece of paper , my wish would not come true			0
so it 's just been sitting in my room , and it 's been a constant reminder of my dream and a constant reminder of what i was working for			0

@entity11 , 16 , is representing @entity12 in table tennis
@entity11 met @entity122 as a child ; he has played with her many times
her advice : " i would just tell people to always fight for their dreams "
