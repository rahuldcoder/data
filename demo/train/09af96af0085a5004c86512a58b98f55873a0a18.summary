@entity0 -- when @entity4 is agitated , his arms flail			1
president @entity5 has a tendency to drone on and on			1
debate experts say both should keep those quirks in check during the upcoming presidential debates			1
that 's because in the world of political theater , nobody likes a ham or a know - it - all , said @entity18 , a debate professor at @entity19			0
so @entity4 should keep that whiteboard full of facts and figures under wraps			1
and @entity5 should keep the lecturing to a minimum			1
" it 's the generation of @entity28 and @entity29 and efficient language choices are persuasive , " @entity26 said			2
both candidates are considered skilled debaters -- @entity4 's campaign called @entity5 a " universally acclaimed public speaker , " and @entity4 was lauded for his performance during the @entity36 presidential primary debates			1
however , there 's a lot more to effective debating than clever rhetoric			0
10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate delivery , tone and body language -- almost as much as substance -- convey a lot to would - be voters , political experts say			1
over the next three weeks , voters will have plenty of opportunities to watch the political posturing unfold			1
wednesday night 's debate in @entity55 is the first of three between the president and @entity4			1
the first debate focuses on domestic policy , so exchanges are bound to be lively , debate experts say			0
" @entity4 and @entity5 will disagree with the foundation of what caused our economy to go south , " said @entity62 , director of debate at @entity63			1
@entity68 : debate all about trust for @entity4 the two men will also mix it up over their different proposals for trimming the nation 's debt and entitlement spending , addressing tax rates , and reforming the nation 's health care system			1
for voters keeping score at home , pay attention to " things like argument depth , trying to get beneath the surface of the argument			1
they 've become quite skilled at not answering the question			0
they 'll repeat the question and then the next few things out of their mouths do n't answer the question , " @entity62 said			0
also , " look for inconsistencies ... things they have or have not said before , " he said			0
vice president @entity95 and @entity4 's running mate , rep. @entity96 of @entity97 , will face off once on foreign policy matters			1
and like their top - of - the - ticket counterparts , the veep candidates also have some habits to watch out for			1
" @entity96 has so much less experience that he 's going to be on talking points for the ticket , " @entity26 said , and that could make him seem a bit stiff			0
on the other hand , " @entity95 has to be careful to not be glib about it and assume his superior knowledge			0
" voters have already handicapped the presidential candidates ' performance			1
according to an @entity116 / @entity115 national poll released monday , 55 % of likely voters say they think the president will win the debate , with 31 % saying the former @entity120 governor will be victorious			2
the findings on this question from the new survey are in line with a @entity1 / @entity126 poll conducted right after the @entity127 last month , where likely voters predicted by 59 % to 34 % that @entity5 was more likely than @entity4 to prevail in the october showdowns			1
the campaigns spent the bulk of last week downplaying expectations			0
@entity4 debate challenge : high stakes , lowered expectations however , there 's still plenty of room for surprises			1
" the mistakes the presidential candidates have made over the years are numerous			1
poor body language has been a common blunder			1
as much as candidates focus on perfecting the substance of what they say before the cameras , a large number of @entity145 are really most interested to see how they say it , " @entity1 contributor and history professor @entity142 wrote for @entity1			2
despite weeks of preparation and practice with debate sparring partners , candidates often revert to nervous tics under the harsh glare of spotlights			1
during a 2008 debate , sen. @entity159 paced on stage ; in 1992 , president @entity162 glanced at his watch ; and in 1960 , vice president @entity164 was sweaty and cast furtive glances			2
both @entity5 and @entity4 have similar habits -- " tells " that signal that they 're nervous			1
the mistakes candidates make in debates " @entity4 is more aggressive , he talks with his hands more and is more animated			1
that 's not a good thing , " @entity26 said , adding that at times @entity4 seems irritated when pressed			2
" he 's a smart man ... but because he is not fully consistent in his message , it shows in his face			0
" such behavior could come across as impatient , @entity26 said			0
" the best thing he could do is shove those hands in his pocket , " she said			0
" even if he were to put one hand in the pocket it would calm ... his body and face down			2
" why debate is crucial for @entity5 , too @entity5 may have a reputation as " cool , calm , collected and very comfortable in his body , " @entity26 said , but he too has his own set of body language challenges			1
the town hall format -- such as the one scheduled for october 16 at @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity192 -- is @entity5 's nemesis			2
it offers a looser , more classroom - like setting , one in which the former law school lecturer tends to slip into the role of an academic			0
" it 's his worst format , " @entity26 said			0
" it was not as pronounced as @entity159 wandering around			0
@entity5 in a town hall is more long - winded			2
he just ca n't help himself			0
" getting ready for wednesday 's showdown both candidates tend to fare well in settings in which they are standing behind podiums			2
" the setup with lecterns and longer questions and answers allows for more direct exchange , " @entity26 said			0
" they 're looking at the moderator and the audience , but they 're also able to look at each other			0
" but there 's also a psychological disadvantage to this , said @entity221			0
" when seated , the candidates become less aggressive , " he said			2
for viewers , that 's a good thing , @entity62 added , saying that voters tend to see aggressive debating tactics as bullying			2
" for @entity229 sakes , do n't actually debate			0
if you actually debate you tend not to do well in the polling the next day , " he said			0
" the public tends to think they were too aggressive and mean and they do n't like them			0
" in @entity236 , @entity4 praises debate partner @entity237 even things like height differences alter perception and the types of gestures a candidate should use , @entity26 said			2
" most of the presidential primary debates were the standard format of the line of humans behind lecterns			2
it generates some power dynamics in size difference , " she added			0
" we associate height with power			0
it 's a subtle stereotype that goes on			0
" so someone smaller , like rep. @entity261 of @entity262 , " had to use larger hand gestures to compensate with size , " @entity26 said			0
at 6 - foot - 1 and 6 - foot - 2 respectively , @entity5 and @entity4 are on an even footing			1
@entity4 : debates are n't about a win @entity1 's @entity266 contributed to this report			1

voters pay close attention to what is said and how it is said during debates
body language tics have hurt presidential candidates in the past
both @entity5 and @entity4 have " tells " to watch out for in stressful situations
