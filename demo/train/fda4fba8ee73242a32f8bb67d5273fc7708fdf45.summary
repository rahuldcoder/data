-- when the dust settled on @entity4 's ipo on thursday afternoon , the company was valued at $ 8.9 billion , making it worth more than household names like @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
as the biggest internet ipo since @entity12 and the first pure social networking site to go public , its jaw - dropping opening - day surge of 109 % will also go down as a watershed moment for the @entity16 , as historically significant as the debuts of @entity18 in 1995 , @entity19 in 1998 and @entity12 in 2004			1
whereas @entity18 's ipo symbolized the dawn of the dotcom boom , @entity19 's epitomized the height of irrational exuberance and @entity12 's ushered in a renaissance of tech innovation after the internet bubble burst , @entity4 's debut will be remembered as social media 's arrival on the capitalist stage known as @entity32			1
for starters , @entity4 's lofty valuation by most anyone 's standards ( at thursday 's closing price of $ 94 , it 's trading at 36 times its 2010 revenue ; @entity12 trades at five times ) will have venture capitalists scrambling to take their internet investments public			1
as venture capitalist @entity43 put it on @entity44 , " @entity4 is @entity18 of this decade			0
ipo window blown wide open			0
" further , the social dynamics that companies like @entity4 thrive on offer something completely different from the first - generation @entity51 companies : incredibly rapid and organic growth			2
whereas in the 1990s , web companies shelled out tens of millions of dollars on advertising to find users , today 's social media leaders like @entity4 acquire new users through network effects -- their services become more valuable to users when their friends sign up			1
this trend is n't going away , and there are undoubtedly dozens if not hundreds of little - known or yet - to - be - founded startups that will go from zero to publicly traded juggernaut in remarkably shorts periods of time			2
add to that the fact that @entity51 companies with a lot more sex appeal than @entity4 -- including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 ( makers of @entity79 ) -- are all likely to go public within the next year , and you have @entity4 taking the pole position in what will be a tidal wave of social media companies entering the public markets			1
aside from the almost inevitable historical significance , however , is the new dynamic that will be created for social media companies that ipo			1
as entities that depend on their users to grow through word of mouth , there will suddenly be a need for community - centric services to balance the needs of their members with the expectations of @entity32			0
there are only a few examples to draw on to predict how this may play out			0
in their " @entity106 " in 2004 , @entity12 's @entity104 and @entity105 wrote that their goal was , " to develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible			0
in pursuing this goal , we may do things that we believe have a positive impact on the world , even if the near term financial returns are not obvious			0
" indeed , the company 's stock has been punished at times when investments in businesses that have become enormously important to @entity12 -- like @entity122 -- were n't showing results on the bottom line			2
in the long run , of course , this philosophy has helped @entity12 's stock price increase by more than five times since going public			2
while some of today 's soon - to - be - public social media companies might not be quite so aspirational , they certainly will face similar challenges			1
will @entity75 play more ads on its internet radio service to beef up its numbers ? will the quality of @entity74 's daily deals diminish as it looks to keep its tremendous growth rate intact ? will @entity73 finally push the privacy envelope too far in the name of meeting earnings estimates ? these are the types of decisions that the current generation of @entity51 companies will have to make when they enter the public markets			0
we 've already seen one prominent example of a company not finding the right balance and the dire consequences that can result			0
while @entity155 's fall from grace can be attributed to a variety of factors , there is no disputing that innovation and user experience languished after its 2005 acquisition by @entity162 , paving the way for @entity73 to swoop in and take the social networking crown			0
returning to @entity4 , while today 's story about its ipo may be about whether it represents a new financial bubble in the internet sector , the story in years to come will be its symbolism in changing the world in which social media companies operate			1
let 's hope , as @entity104 and @entity105 put it so well in 2004 , that the change leaves a positive impact on the world .			0

@entity4 's stock market debut is the biggest internet ipo since @entity12
@entity167 may inspire little - known startups to become publicly traded juggernauts
@entity4 's example will create a new dynamic for social media companies that ipo
