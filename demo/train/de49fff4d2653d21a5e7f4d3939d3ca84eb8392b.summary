@entity0 -- in a pair of votes aimed more at making political points than law , the @entity2 rejected competing @entity8 and @entity9 proposals to boost construction of roadways and other infrastructure projects			1
republicans blocked the @entity8 bill , which would have approved about $ 50 billion for projects and another $ 10 billion to start an " infrastructure bank , " because it relied on a surtax on people earning more than $ 1 million a year			1
@entity8 have tried to pass the surtax multiple times in an effort to convince voters that @entity13 care more about their wealthy constituents than about putting the unemployed back to work			2
@entity13 dispute that and argue that the special tax would hit small businesses the hardest , which would curtail hiring			0
the @entity29 issued a press release thursday evening saying the @entity9 is " out of touch with @entity32 from all ends of the political spectrum			1
" " it makes no sense when you consider that this bill was made up of the same kinds of common - sense proposals that many of these senators have fought for in the past , " the statement said			0
" it was fully paid for			0
and even though it was supported by more than 70 % of the @entity32 people -- republicans , @entity8 , and independents -- 100 % of @entity13 said no. " @entity8 rejected a @entity9 proposal that was aimed , in part , at speeding infrastructure spending by easing regulations that can slow construction , because they oppose @entity9 plans to offset its cost by rescinding $ 40 billion in spending approved for this year			1
@entity8 said that violated an agreement about spending levels reached during the debt - ceiling negotiations this year			0
neither measure could reach the 60 - vote threshold for approval			2
the @entity8 measure failed 51 - 49			0
two members of the @entity8 caucus , @entity66 of @entity67 and @entity68 of @entity69 , joined all @entity9 senators in voting against it			2
@entity68 is facing a potentially difficult re-election fight			0
the @entity9 measure failed on a vote of 47 - 53			1
democrat @entity75 of @entity76 voted for the @entity9 bill , and @entity9 @entity78 of @entity79 voted against it			0
both are up for re-election			0
also on thursday , house speaker @entity83 unveiled plans to move a separate infrastructure bill through that chamber			2
the @entity9 - backed measure would provide " a new , devoted revenue stream " by tying infrastructure spending to expanded domestic energy production , using revenue generated from new production to help pay for infrastructure initiatives across the country			1
" this is , i think , the opposite of stimulus , by linking infrastructure to energy reform and permanently removing barriers to job growth , instead of just spending money on short - term fixes , " @entity83 said			2
details of the measure are not yet available , but @entity83 said he hoped to introduce the bill in the next couple of weeks and then pass the bill through the @entity29 before the end of the year			1
" the president says he wants more money for infrastructure and he 's said he supports more @entity32 - made energy , so i hope he 'll work with us on this , " @entity83 said			1
@entity1 congressional correspondent @entity116 contributed to this report .			0
