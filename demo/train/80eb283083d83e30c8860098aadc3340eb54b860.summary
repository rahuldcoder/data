@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has made his name playing famous historical figures			1
he won an @entity6 for his portrayal of @entity8 in a 1974 tv miniseries , accolades as " @entity11 " in 1976 's " @entity12 , " and a @entity13 as @entity14 -- a performance he 's been giving now for a half - century -- in " @entity14 tonight ! " @entity3 , 83 , is nominated for his role as @entity17 in " @entity18			1
" but playing @entity17 , the thoughtful , down - to - earth 81 - year - old who bonds with a youthful adventurer in " @entity18 , " was an opportunity he dared not miss , he says in a phone interview			1
" this was an opportunity , and a rare one for me , to just play myself , to not do @entity8 or another character , " @entity3 says in his familiar rich baritone			1
" i did n't want to research anything			0
i had a very personal reaction to the role			0
" @entity3 's gut feeling has led to some of the best reviews of his career and a first for the actor : a nomination for an @entity37			1
at 83 -- his birthday was last sunday -- he 's the oldest man ever to be nominated for best supporting actor			1
the @entity37 are scheduled for sunday night			1
" @entity18 " is due out on video march 4			1
@entity3 says he 's familiar with the kind of adventurousness exhibited by @entity43 , played by @entity44 in @entity46 's film			1
@entity3 has gone into the wilderness himself			1
he 's also sailed the open sea in a small boat , accompanied by little more than a sextant and a map			0
" no electronics , " he says			0
he 's even traveled in @entity43 ' tracks , taking a trip to @entity55 the year after the self - named " @entity43 " died			0
" they were still talking about him , whether he was crazy , " @entity3 recalls			1
@entity3 , who 'd also read @entity59 's book about @entity43 ' journey , says he was sent the script " @entity62 " and told that @entity46 wanted to meet with him the next day			1
the director , upon discussing the part with him , offered @entity3 the role			1
@entity3 has nothing but praise for @entity46 's work on the film			1
" to work with @entity46 might be the best experience i 've ever had with a director , " he says			2
" he 's so trusting			0
there was none of this ' let 's discuss the back story ' -- he trusts you			0
he 'll take whatever you give him , and begins to open up your sense of freedom			0
he gives you space to explore whatever the scenes bring out of you			0
" @entity3 also has high praise for @entity44 , who lost 40 pounds for the role			2
" [ his performance ] was a brilliant piece of work			0
... an actor takes his performance from other actors , and in this case it was easy , " he says , adding that " i 'm astounded he was n't nominated -- he deserved it more than anybody			2
" read @entity44 's view of " @entity18			2
" but @entity3 also paid tribute to a person seldom considered by the audience : the film editor , in this case @entity100			1
by changing the sequence of two scenes , @entity100 gave the film an added power -- which made all the difference to how his performance was perceived , @entity3 says			1
" i have never been more aware of an editor 's genius as i have in this particular film , " he says			2
referring to the film 's back - and - forth chronology , which he calls " a very daring piece of work , " he marvels at how @entity100 and @entity46 fit the pieces together			0
" it 's quite an achievement , " @entity3 says			2
" the effect it can have on a performance is profound			0
" @entity100 's work earned " @entity18 " its only other @entity37 nomination			1
@entity3 has had a busy couple months , with his performance nominated for critics ' awards as well as a @entity123			2
the activity has taken the steadily working actor away from a personal project : his memoirs			0
" trying to fit all these things in -- it ai n't easy , " he chuckles			0
" i had to stop [ writing ] for the last month or so			0
" he does n't give himself much of a possibility to win : slim and none are my chances , " he says			0
still , he treasures the experience			0
the @entity37 nomination " is like a miracle , " he says			2
" after 65 years or so [ of acting ] , to be nominated for an @entity37 is a great gift			2
