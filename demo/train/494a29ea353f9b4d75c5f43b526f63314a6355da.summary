-- a passenger jet shot out of the sky two weeks ago brought the world 's attention to eastern @entity5 , where government forces are battling @entity8 separatists			1
but with so much fast - breaking global news , it 's easy to lose track of the latest developments			0
here 's a guide to get you up to speed on the @entity16 flight 17 crash investigation and the conflict in eastern @entity5 , based on the latest @entity0 reporting			1
there still may be dozens of bodies at the crash site			1
so far , at least 227 coffins from the crash site have been transported to @entity23			1
but as many as 80 bodies could still be lying in the fields of eastern @entity5 where the passenger jet crashed , @entity25 's foreign minister told @entity0 on thursday			1
" but we wo n't know until our investigative teams are on the site and combing the crash site for remains , " foreign minister @entity29 said			1
" and that 's the grisly and sobering task that they must undertake from now on			0
" all 298 people aboard the @entity37 were killed when it plunged to the ground near the @entity41 border in rural eastern @entity5			1
@entity43 and @entity5 officials have alleged that a @entity41 - made missile system downed the plane from rebel - held territory ; @entity41 and the rebel fighters deny involvement			1
investigators are having a hard time getting there			0
for four days this week , dangerous clashes in the area stopped investigators from getting to the site			0
the @entity5 government claimed that rebels had placed landmines nearby			2
on thursday , teams of experts and investigators got through -- but only after six hours of travel -- a journey three times longer than usual			0
the trip was possible only after high - level political agreements were negotiated with both sides , said @entity69 , spokesman for the @entity70			0
even once investigators are able to get regular access to the site , there are a lot of questions about what useful evidence will be left			0
" it is one of the biggest open crime scenes in the world as we speak , " @entity69 said , " and it is not secured			1
" fighting is raging near the crash site			1
the @entity87 crash has n't put a stop to fighting between government forces and separatists in the area			0
@entity5 's military announced a one - day cease - fire thursday to allow international experts full access to the crash site			1
but that came after days of clashes in the area			0
heavy shelling and anti-aircraft fire in @entity101 sent many people fleeing over the weekend			0
@entity104 launched by both sides have killed at least 16 civilians and wounded many more in separatist - controlled areas of @entity101 and its suburbs since july 12 , @entity103 said			0
the turmoil started months ago			0
after popular protests toppled @entity5 's @entity115 president @entity114 from power in february , @entity112 rebels first appeared in @entity5 's @entity117 , where they seized key infrastructure			2
the region was subsequently annexed by @entity41			2
unrest then broke out in eastern @entity5 , a heartland of support for @entity114 , where many people speak @entity41 and feel closer ties to @entity124 than to @entity125			1
rebel leaders in @entity127 and @entity101 seized key government buildings and declared themselves the heads of the @entity131 's republics of @entity101 and @entity127			0
in may , a referendum was held in each region on secession from @entity5			2
@entity41 has showed no sign of backing down			1
in fact , quite the opposite , according to @entity43 and @entity5 officials -- who say that @entity41 is arming the rebels and pushing to take over @entity5 territory			1
last week , the @entity43 said it had proof that @entity41 was firing into @entity5			1
" we have new evidence that the @entity41 intend to deliver heavier and more powerful multiple rocket launchers to the separatist forces in @entity5 and have evidence that @entity41 is firing artillery from within @entity41 to attack @entity5 military positions , " @entity144 spokeswoman @entity143 said last week			2
@entity41 denies accusations that it 's arming the rebels or aiming to annex more territory			2
to turn the tide , @entity155 and the @entity43 are trying to hit @entity41 where it hurts : its pocketbook			1
this week the @entity159 and the @entity43 slapped @entity41 companies and cronies of president @entity162 with sanctions			1
@entity162 's longtime acquaintance and judo sparring partner , @entity167 , and the @entity168 are among those targeted			0
foreign minister @entity170 has shrugged off the sanctions , saying his country is n't happy about them but will overcome any economic difficulties and become more independent as a result			0
this could be the start of another @entity178 ... or not			2
whether this is a battle in a new @entity178 depends on whom you ask			2
@entity41 lawmaker @entity182 , the head of the @entity184 's foreign affairs committee , said via @entity185 that @entity43 president @entity191 " will make history not as a peacekeeper , everyone forgot about his @entity189 , but as the statesman who started a new @entity178			1
" @entity191 brushed aside such a comparison when asked about it by reporters this week			0
" it 's not a new @entity178 , " he said			0
" what it is is a very specific issue related to @entity41 's unwillingness to recognize that @entity5 can chart its own path			2
" @entity0 's @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .			0
