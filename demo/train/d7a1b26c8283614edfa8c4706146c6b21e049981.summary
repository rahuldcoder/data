@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday voted in favor of a bill that would extend term limits , allowing mayor @entity6 to run for a third term			1
@entity0 mayor @entity6 wants to seek a third term in office			1
the vote was 29 in favor and 22 against			1
@entity6 , who introduced the measure , welcomed the council 's approval as the " right choice			1
" " those of us who work on both sides of @entity22 must now move forward with the important decisions that face us , particularly finding ways to soften the fallout from the economic downturn and balancing our budget as revenues decline , " he said in a statement			0
" we have a lot of work to do together to get @entity0 through these tough times			0
" the bill allows most elected officials , including the mayor , to serve a third four - year term			1
previously , @entity0 mayors had been allowed to serve only two four - year terms , meaning @entity38 would have been required to leave office at the end of next year			2
the vote followed two hours of lively debate in a packed room in @entity22 , where public advocate @entity44 frequently admonished council members for going over their allotted time to speak			2
the chatter in the room prompted her to bang her gavel several times to call for order			0
the vote also came after the council nixed efforts to put the measure to a public referendum			1
earlier , the council voted 22 in favor and 28 , with one abstention , against an amendment to the bill that would have called for a voter referendum on the issue of term limits			1
" @entity0 went to the polls twice and said , ' we want term limits , ' " @entity64 said , referring to a public vote in 1993 that imposed the two - term limit and another vote in 1996 that maintained it			1
" for us to overturn that legislatively is a disgrace , " he said			0
" you should be all voted out of office for this			0
" councilman @entity76 agreed , reminding his colleagues of a proposal put forth to voters in in 2007 in @entity80 that would have allowed president @entity81 to seek re-election indefinitely			0
the @entity80 voters narrowly shot it down			0
" mayor @entity6 , be like @entity81 and let the people decide , " he said			1
" if we 're talking about direct democracy , where the people rule , and a representative democracy , where those who represent the people come to vote -- if you do this , you 're undermining the very people that vote you in to represent them , " he said earlier thursday , arguing in favor of the amendment to put the issue to a public referendum			1
council speaker @entity99 noted in her opening remarks that the vote was " a very difficult vote in very difficult times			2
" " our city , already in recession , is headed for a long and deep downturn , " she said			0
" we will need to do more with less to keep our city moving in the right direction			0
" earlier in the day , @entity108 , an elected official , voiced her support for the bill			2
" at a time like this , we need consistent leadership , " she said			0
" voters should have the choice to continue their current leadership			0
they should have the right to vote for the current mayor or a new one			2
" @entity6 , who was elected as a @entity120 months after the september 11 attacks , is credited with helping @entity0 recover economically afterward			2
he was re-elected in 2005 and became an independent in 2007			0
the billionaire businessman announced in early october his intention to ask the @entity2 to amend the term limits so he could run for re-election			1
" if the @entity2 should vote to amend term limits , i plan to ask @entity0 to look at my record of independent leadership and then decide if i 've earned another term , " @entity6 said at @entity22			1
" i care deeply about sustaining the progress we made and finishing the job the voters elected me to do			0
" on wednesday , council members @entity136 and @entity137 filed suit in a state court seeking to block the council 's vote , arguing that it would be a conflict of interest for council members to vote on the bill			2
the city 's @entity147 determined last week that the council members ' vote would not violate conflict of interest rules			2
@entity153 and @entity154 condemned the board 's decision , saying it was " so rushed , so results - oriented , so poorly reasoned and so damaging to the high ethical standards the charter 's framers intended			0
" however , judge @entity162 denied @entity136 and @entity154 ' petition , and their lawyer , @entity164 , has said he will not appeal			0
according to a @entity168 poll released tuesday , 89 percent of @entity0 voters said the issue of term limits should be decided by voters in a referendum , not by the @entity2			1
the poll also found that 51 percent of voters opposed extending the term limits so @entity38 could run again			1
forty - five percent of voters were in favor of extending the term limits for their mayor			1
@entity1 's @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
