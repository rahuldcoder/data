@entity0 -- nearly 13 years after terrorists hijacked four airliners , crashed them and killed almost 3,000 people , a museum dedicated to the day that changed @entity6 will open in @entity0			1
the national september 11 @entity9 will open to the general public on may 21 , the museum and memorial group announced monday			1
the museum , located at the site of the original @entity13 , will feature a core memorial exhibition that pays tribute to the 2,983 people killed in the september 11 , 2001 attacks and in the february 26 , 1993 bombing of the @entity13			0
a second historical exhibition , told through personal artifacts , photographs , audio and video footage and first - person testimonials , will explore what led up to the terror strikes , examine the aftermath and illustrate how 9/11 continues to shape our world , according to a statement from the museum			2
" when the museum opens to the public on may 21 , millions will come to further understand the experiences , courageous actions , and terrible losses that we saw on 9/11 and in the aftermath			1
the museum will forever remind us of the capacity we have to come together when the times require , " 9/11 memorial president @entity39 said			0
the official opening will be preceded by a five day , 24 - hour dedication period during which members of the 9/11 community will have exclusive access to the museum and memorial			1
during that time , family members of those lost on 9/11 , rescue and recovery workers , active duty first responders from agencies that lost members in the attacks and survivors of the attacks -- as well as lower @entity64 residents and business owners -- will be able to visit the memorial and museum when it is best for them , the release said			2
" we are honored that the first people to experience this museum will be the men and women who came to our aid and protected us on 9/11 , the families of the innocent victims killed that day , and the survivors who lived to tell the tale of an unimaginable horror so that we may learn from the past			1
the museum is built upon their incredible stories , " @entity80 chair and former @entity0 mayor @entity81 said			1
family members of those killed on that day will not have to pay admission to the museum , nor will rescue and recovery workers who are registered with the @entity80			1
tickets for the general public will be available beginning march 26 on the museum 's website			2
the museum will also house a repository of the 8,000 sets of remains that have yet to be identified from the 9/11 attacks			2
the remains , which are in the custody of the @entity99 , will be kept behind a wall in an area off - limits to the public , said 9/11 museum spokesman @entity103			1
the museum 's website says the wall , which visitors will be able to view , will be inscribed with the words of @entity108 poet @entity107 : " no day shall erase you from the memory of time			2
" only medical examiners and victims ' families will be given access to the repository , where dna identifications of the unidentified remains will continue , according to representatives from the museum and the medical examiner 's office			1
the decision to house the remains in the museum repository has been controversial			0
in 2011 , 17 families of 9/11 victims filed a petition in court to force the museum to consult with victims ' families before deciding what to do with the remains			1
they eventually asked for a congressional hearing			0
on its website , the museum said the decision to move the remains to the repository at the museum was due to the overwhelming feedback received from families after the attacks			1
" you will never be able to please everyone			0
when it comes to human remains , we have to treat them with as much dignity and respect ( as ) they deserve , " said @entity146 , president and co-founder of @entity148			0
@entity156 lost his son , a 29 - year - old firefighter , on 9/11			0
" now is the time to bring those remains back to where they have been murdered			0
" when hijacked @entity162 and @entity163 were intentionally crashed into the north and south towers of the @entity13 on 9/11 , 2,753 people were killed			0
on the same day , another 224 people died when hijacked planes crashed into the @entity168 and in a field outside @entity170 , @entity171			0
a february 26 , 1993 terror attack -- also at the @entity13 -- left six people dead			0
