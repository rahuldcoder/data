fiery asteroids smash into @entity3 's atmosphere at such a stunning rate , it 's a wonder we do n't see fireballs raining down from the skies more frequently			2
a new @entity9 map from the space agency 's @entity10 , reveals that more than 556 space rocks smashed into the atmosphere over a 20 - year period between 1994 and 2013			1
@entity9 's @entity10 the good news is most are small and harmless fireballs that disintegrate when they hit the atmosphere , the space agency said in a press release			2
an obvious exception occurred on february 15 , 2013 , when an asteroid as large as 55 feet in diameter with a mass of up to 10,000 tons crashed to earth in the @entity25 region in @entity26 , streaking through the morning sky in @entity28 before landing in a fiery explosion that injured more than a thousand people and caused an estimated $ 33 million in damage			1
@entity26 starts cleanup after meteor strike @entity9 said the @entity28 asteroid was the largest to hit the @entity3 during the agency 's mapping period			1
meteor streaks across @entity26 skies meteor blast at local school asteroids are defined by @entity9 as rocky bodies in space that orbit the @entity45 of them are large enough to be considered minor planets			1
when pieces of an asteroid or comet break off from the main body , they 're referred to as meteroids			0
a meteor is actually the light that is seen in the sky when a meteoroid enters @entity3 's atmosphere			0
a meteor shower is seen when lots of these smaller particles fall to @entity3			0
according to @entity9 , meteroids are usually small , but can range " from dust particle to boulder size			0
" meteor showers put on quite a show the @entity67 helps detect and track space rocks that could cause a potential danger to @entity3			1
" the new data could help scientists better refine estimates of the distribution of the sizes of @entity10 , " @entity9 explained			0
" finding and characterizing hazardous asteroids to protect our home planet is a high priority			0
" the space agency has increased its efforts at finding and tracking potentially dangerous space objects with the idea of developing ways to protect the @entity3 from one , should it ever become necessary			1
@entity9 is also developing an @entity85 called @entity85			0
in a plan that sounds a lot like science fiction , @entity9 wants to redirect a space rock into orbit around the moon by the 2020s so astronauts can study it more closely			2
the mission could also help develop ways to deflect an asteroid should one be found on a collision course for @entity3			2
