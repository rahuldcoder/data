-- international scientists have announced the discovery of a tiny moon orbiting @entity4			1
the speck of light , captured by cameras on board the @entity10 spacecraft , was first observed on august 15			1
the speck of light , captured by cameras on board the @entity10 spacecraft , was first observed on august 15			1
a review found the moonlet on two earlier images and it has since been seen on multiple occasions			0
the finding appeared in tuesday 's edition of the @entity20 circular			0
the moon is about one - third of a mile ( a half - kilometer ) across and circles @entity4 as a part of the planet 's sixth , or @entity27 , ring			1
" before @entity10 , the g ring was the only dusty ring that was not clearly associated with a known moon , which made it odd , " said @entity28 , a @entity10 imaging team associate at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32			2
" the discovery of this moonlet , together with other @entity10 data , should help us make sense of this previously mysterious ring			2
" early next year , @entity10 's camera will take a closer look at the moonlet			0
the @entity47 mission , an extension of the original four - year mission , is expected to continue until fall 2010			0
if the craft continues to function properly , the mission could be extended up to two more years			0
@entity10 , which was funded by @entity52 and the @entity54 and @entity55 space agencies , launched in 1997 and took seven years to make the 934 million - mile ( 1.5 billion - kilometer ) trip to @entity4			1
since its arrival , @entity10 has been making a looping voyage through the @entity4 system and is returning loads of data on the ringed planet and its moons			2
three years ago , a space probe launched from @entity10 found evidence of geysers erupting from underground pools of liquid water on @entity4 's moon @entity70			1
high - definition pictures beamed back from the probe showed huge plumes of ice coming from the moon 's south pole .			0
