-- @entity4 pirates hijacked a yacht with four @entity2 onboard in the @entity6 , @entity2 military officials said saturday			1
the identities of the @entity2 were not immediately known , but the yacht , the @entity9 , is owned by @entity10 and @entity11 , according to @entity12			1
it is not clear whether the @entity14 -- who were on a worldwide cruise -- are onboard			2
the @entity2 military is prepared to intervene in the situation if necessary , said rear adm. @entity18 , deputy commander of the @entity20 's @entity19 , based in @entity21			1
" they were part of a sailing group that set sail from the southern tip of @entity29 into the western @entity6 , " he said , adding that the situation is being monitored with @entity23			1
@entity18 said there is no reason to believe the hijacked yacht has been taken to the coastline of @entity4 yet , though pirates in the region have been known to do so			2
another @entity2 official , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation , said the @entity2 is determining what military assets are in the region and the capabilities of the personnel onboard			1
the official said that the pirates are believed to be onboard the yacht with the @entity2 , and the next step would be to determine whether the military could keep the yacht from reaching the shore -- either by blocking or harassing it			1
authorities said the yacht was en route from @entity29 to @entity55 when it was captured friday			1
the @entity14 ' website documents their worldwide voyage , which started in late 2004			0

@entity76 said @entity11 had told him several weeks ago that he was concerned about pirate activity in the area , which he had never visited before , but was determined to traverse the world himself as opposed to shipping the boat -- as some other yacht owners have done			2
" they weighed their options and decided they would join the rally for safety , " @entity76 said			0
on their website , the @entity14 say their mission " is to allow the power of the @entity93 to transform lives ... ( and ) seek fertile ground for the word and homes for our bibles			0
