-- the @entity1 has launched , freshly stocked with over 1,000 @entity3 applications			1
the store comes as part of an @entity3 update , version 10.6.6 , and is a standalone application rather than being yet another add - on to the already creaking and bloated @entity10			1
the store works a lot like the @entity12 we know already : you sign in with your @entity15 and then you can shop			2
buy a @entity17 app and the payment is charged to your registered credit card account , and the app downloads automatically and is placed in the applications folder , with a convenient shortcut placed in the dock ( the icon actually leaps from the @entity26 window and lands in the dock -- neat )			0
this is clearly aimed at novice users who may never have actually downloaded and installed third - party software before , and the interface will be instantly familiar to anyone who has used the @entity1 in @entity10 or on an @entity34			1
that said , there is plenty for power - users , too			1
@entity40 's flagship photo - editing software , @entity41 , is in the store for just $ 80			1
you can still buy it from the conventional @entity45 , but it 'll cost the usual $ 200			0
that 's quite a saving			1
the @entity49 office suite is in there , too , although it remains the ' 09 version , not a new ' 11 update many were hoping for			2
the three @entity49 apps , pages , @entity55 , cost $ 20 apiece , a saving on the usual $ 80 bundle price			0
if you already have these installed on your @entity17 , the @entity1 detects this and shows them as " installed " , just like on the @entity34			1
there are also free apps -- the slick new @entity62 , for example , which is the long awaited v2.0 of @entity64 for @entity17 -- as well as some old favorites ( " @entity66 " is quite something on a 27 - inch @entity69 screen )			2
there are no trials in the @entity1 , and submissions are subject to strict rules , just like the @entity75 store			1
it appears that some of these can be waived , though			0
@entity62 is clearly using custom , non standard user interface elements and it is featured on the front page			0
@entity40 is clearly playing somewhat by its own rules here , too			2
no trial versions are are allowed in the store , so developers have to host them on their own sites			0
@entity40 has abided , and the trial for the @entity49 suite is on the main @entity40 site i predict that the store is going to be huge			0
it has the same kid - in - a - candy - store addictive qualities of the @entity98 and @entity34 stores , along with a few features missing from the mobile versions			2
on the @entity17 , for example , all your purchases are listed under a tab in the top toolbar			0
finally , here 's a tip : up in the @entity40 menu , on the top left of your screen , you 'll see a new entry called " @entity1			1
" this replaces the old " @entity113 " which has quietly been retired			0
