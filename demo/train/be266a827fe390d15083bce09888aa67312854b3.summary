@entity0 -- @entity3 lawmakers want to rename one of @entity0 's most famous landmarks -- known to tourists around the world as " @entity8 " -- after @entity9 , for her @entity10			1
the @entity9 marks 60 years on the throne in 2012 , and politicians believe that naming @entity13 , the clock tower at the @entity15 , in her honor would be a fitting tribute to her years of service			1
" not many kings and queens have served for such a long time , " conservative mp @entity19 , who is leading the renaming campaign , told @entity1			0
" only two have celebrated their @entity10 -- @entity9 , and @entity24			1
" the other tower at the @entity15 is named in honour of @entity9 @entity24 ; the clock tower has lots of nicknames -- @entity8 , @entity30 , or just the @entity31 -- but no official name			1
" it seems a superb way to honor a very distinguished life , and the many years of service she has given to the country			0
" @entity19 said his plan had the support of mps from across the political spectrum , and that he hoped they would back his bill to officially name the tower after the @entity9 in the coming weeks -- in time for the @entity10 celebrations in june			1
" of course , if it does go ahead it will mean that the next time a monarch reaches their 60th anniversary we 'll have to build another tower -- but i do n't suppose we 'll have to worry about that for a while , " he joked			2
" @entity8 " is officially the name of the 13.5 ton bell inside @entity30 , and not the name of the tower itself			2
the bell rang out for the first time in july 1859 -- but cracked two months later			0
its chimes were silenced for the next four years , until a way was found to make it peal again in 1863 ( by turning it slightly ) , however , the crack is still visible			0
today it rings -- in the key of @entity68 -- each hour , while a series of quarter bells chime every 15 minutes			0
it remains unclear whether the new name -- @entity8 -- will capture the public imagination , or if they will continue to refer to it as " @entity8 "			2
however , jokers have already suggested a new nickname : " @entity78			0
