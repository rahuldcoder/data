-- in 1965 , a 40 - year - old @entity1 ran for mayor of @entity3 -- a race he arguably never intended to win			0
in fact , when asked what he 'd do if he won he replied , " demand a recount			0
" but 10 years after founding the @entity9 and one year after establishing @entity10 as the conservative nominee for president , @entity8 saw that the often - times colorful mayoral election was a useful vehicle for him to elevate his brand and promote conservatism on a national platform			0
though he won only 13.4 % of the vote , he still managed to accomplish his objective			0
and , many credit him with helping rep. @entity21 become the first @entity23 mayor of @entity3 since @entity24			0
some suggested early on that @entity27 's bid for mayor was similarly designed -- not to actually win , but toward other ends			1
@entity30 in the @entity31 earlier this year suggested this was all an inoculation attempt			0
not for @entity27 , but for his wife @entity34 , who either had designs on her own political career or at least on helping to implement her boss @entity38 's 2016 run			1
" if @entity34 , and not @entity27 , were the first one to hit the campaign trail after his resignation , " she wrote , " she would have been the one who was tarnished by his sexts			1
or , imagine @entity44 trying to focus on eating fried things at the @entity47 state fair in 2015 , while reporters ask her about new photos on @entity51 of her aide 's infamous husband			2
" it 's an intriguing idea , but very few could argue that @entity34 emerged out of her husband 's campaign untarnished			1
it was n't just hosting awkward " women for @entity27 " events that call into question everything we think we know about feminism			1
or advancing arguably false narratives in glossy magazines that her husband 's exploits were dealt with and over , when it was clear @entity27 continued his online activities well after resigning from @entity71			1
putting his indiscretions aside , it 's hard to reconcile such a smart and successful woman finding admiration in a man who ran such a terrible , pugnacious , ineffective and utterly ridiculous campaign			1
the man who yelled at his own constituents , called his 69 - year - old opponent " grandpa " at an @entity82 event , and poetically flipped off reporters on his final ride out of town is her political and personal inspiration ? if helping @entity34 was the plan all along , i think it 's safe to say it has not worked			2
others have suggested he might just want his own television show			0
plenty of disgraced former politicians have found a forgiving sanctuary on cable television			0
and he certainly would make for a fascinating , er , something ... on tv			0
but he did n't need to mount an embarrassing and ultimately ruinous mayoral campaign to get there			1
one turn of the dial and it 's clear that there are countless sociopaths , buffoons , hucksters and charlatans with real political platforms who were never on a ballot			2
other than " @entity119 " or " @entity120 , " i doubt @entity27 solidified his chances of a major television gig with this last performance			1
others still believe @entity27 was merely out for revenge			1
revenge against the @entity123 and @entity124 and even establishment @entity125 who ruined his life , a final " take that " to punctuate the scandal			0
and he did n't need to win to do it			2
a respectable finish in the primary would have telegraphed that he was run out by gotcha journalists , partisan extremists and spineless bureaucrats , and his real friends -- the voters -- still believed in him			0
i 'm not sure he can make that case , though , after finishing virtually dead last and capturing a paltry 5 % of the ultra-liberal @entity125 who actually turned out for this thing			0
ultimately , unlike @entity8 and conservatism , @entity27 did nothing good for liberalism			1
he wanted a campaign of ideas , but instead waged a campaign of idiotic outbursts			1
he brought nothing but more embarrassment and shame for his wife and her famous boss			1
and he did nothing to make " @entity27 the brand " any more credible			2
in fact the only constituency he managed to please were @entity159 headline writers			0
maybe he really did want to win			0
and maybe he really thought he could			0
where there 's power to be had , pathological miscalculations of this sort are n't uncommon			2
but if he cares about his party , his wife , her career , his brand , and his own future , he will make the courageous decision to go away from politics for a very long time			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : some speculated that winning was n't @entity27 's goal
he could have wanted to help his wife 's career or raise his visibility for future roles , she says
@entity185 : whatever the goal , @entity27 's campaign was an embarrassment
he said he wanted a campaign of ideas ; we got a campaign of idiotic outbursts
