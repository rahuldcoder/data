-- the tween who took the internet by storm last year starring in the hilarious and empowering " @entity6 " ad , about a girl who is the first at her summer camp to get her period , is back			1
nearly 10 million video views later , @entity11 , now a sixth - grader , returns , but this time her focus is on middle school and the consequences of some very bad decisions her character makes along the way			1
in a unique twist , 11 - year - old @entity11 plays the character from tweenhood into adulthood			2
in the opening scene , we hear a few gunshots ring out and then see @entity11 's character racing out of a motor home wearing heels and a leather jacket			1
she hops into a car with a guy who looks like bad news , telling herself , " look at me , 38 years old and i 'm running out of this place in this dress to this moron			0
" at moments like this , you ca n't help but do a little soul - searching and ask yourself , ' how did i end up here ? ' " she says , at which point we go back in time			0
we see her when she was six months pregnant at 24 and took back her partner , a serial cheater , before taking a drag on a cigarette			0
at 15 , when her friend told her getting high was " awesome			0
" when she faced a choice , that very first day of middle school , between joining the group of kids sporting angry looks , dressed in black and smoking versus another group smiling and waving , carrying books titled " @entity59			1
" " i guess there 's no way to pinpoint that one moment where it all started to fall apart , but if i had to do it all over again , you bet your sweet ass i 'd make some different choices			0
" period power : talking to girls about ' @entity69 ' sure , it 's a tad over the top , but do n't you remember kids who went with the wrong crowd in middle school and never quite recovered ? the video , which i 'd love to show my girls when they get closer to middle school , is a unique trailer for @entity11 's father 's new book " @entity81 : an interactive story for girls			1
" @entity84 said the book was in the works long before his daughter 's viral fame , but the trailer was , in fact , inspired by that success			1
the idea came from @entity93 , a relative who is an executive creative director for the ad agency @entity94 , during a holiday party about a year ago			0
" he offered on the spot to assemble a team , the best in the business , to try to create something that would star @entity11 , so how could i say no ? " said @entity11 , whose day job is running a two - person law firm from his home			2
replace the ' sex talk ' with the ' tech talk ' ? " it fit in really nicely with the book because it could convey the same point : that choices matter going all the way back to middle school			1
" the book , modeled around the " @entity117 " books @entity11 enjoyed as a child , lets the reader decide what to do and tackles some pressing issues affecting today 's tweens and teens , who are growing up in a digital age			1
for instance , do you stick up for a female classmate from @entity127 who is being bulled in person and online by a mean girl who makes fun of her name and her @entity127 jewelry collection , or do you decide to stay out of it , knowing that if you speak up you might invite the attention of the bully ? " the idea was give them a decision that , at least , i think there 's a right or wrong answer ... and then couch it in a way so it looks really tantalizing to them to do the wrong thing and then see what they do , " said @entity11			2
another choice readers of the book face centers on getting an @entity151 account and becoming friends with a sixth grader in @entity154 , who turns out not to be a sixth grader but a grown man			0
do you continue the friendship or do you cut things off once you learn the truth and start feeling a bit uncomfortable ? " you can make the wrong choice and you can be down this road and you 're stuck , and it 's not a great outcome , " said @entity11			2
what parents can learn about the internet from @entity167 " i think that something parents have to acknowledge these days is that with technology and earlier puberty and a whole host of other factors , girls are forced to make really tough choices that have serious consequences at a much earlier age than when we were kids and i 'm seeing that on a day to day basis with my daughter			0
" the father of two ( @entity11 has a younger sister ) says he hopes his book and trailer will both entertain and spark conversation about issues affecting middle schoolers just as the " @entity189 " ad got people talking about menstruation and girl empowerment			1
" in my ideal world , kids are standing around the playground discussing how they chose or bringing it up with their parents or disagreeing with one of the outcomes in the book , " he said			0
" the discourse that was created and generated by ' @entity189 ' is the same sort of thing that i would love to happen and be generated from the book			2
" " i mean , these are heavy issues , and i think that the best way to get kids talking about them is to present them with something they enjoy			0
" chances are , your teen has sexted as for @entity216 , life is pretty much back to normal after her " @entity6 " fame			2
her classmates have for the most part been supportive , with the exception of some snickering by the boys from time to time , and she 's now focused on middle school and continuing her acting career , said @entity11 " she 's clearly got a nickname for life			1
it 'll probably be the beginning of her college essay as well , " said her proud dad			0
" she 's embraced it , but she 's moved on			0
" do you think the video about the consequences of bad decisions in middle school helps get the point across to tweens and teens ? tell @entity240 on @entity241 or @entity242 on @entity243 .			1

" @entity6 " ad starring @entity11 has been seen nearly 10 million times
in new video , @entity11 's character makes some bad decisions during middle school
the video is a trailer for @entity11 's father 's new book " @entity81 "
@entity84 hopes his video and book spark a conversation just as " @entity189 " did
