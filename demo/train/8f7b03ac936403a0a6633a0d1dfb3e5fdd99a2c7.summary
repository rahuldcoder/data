what @entity1 city has fallen under the rule of the @entity3 , the @entity4 , the @entity5 and the @entity6 ? here 's a clue : it 's lined with cobbled roads and features some of the world 's most eclectic examples of historic architecture -- from renaissance to baroque to art deco			1
answer : @entity16 , @entity18 's official capital of culture			1
never heard of it ? you 're not alone			0
with its independent coffee houses and traditional chocolatiers , @entity16 looks , smells , and tastes like the best of @entity1			2
indeed , its @entity27 flavor has earned it the moniker " @entity29 of @entity18			2
" and yet , compared to other prized @entity1 cities , relatively few people travel here			0
for centuries @entity16 -- located 50 kilometers from the @entity33 - @entity18 border -- was a significant stopping point on the main trade routes between the east and west -- and this prime location helped pay for its striking beauty			1
" you had to be rich and famous to be here , " explained local historian @entity39			0
during the renaissance , the city could afford @entity45 's finest architects because every merchant passing through was forced to stay and sell their goods for at least two weeks			2
" it was a very smart move to collect money from them , " said @entity39			0
" it kept the wealth in the city , and that wealth has been transformed into ( architectural ) richness			2
" read related : gas pipes and price hikes : @entity18 , @entity59 's uneasy alliance the buildings endure but @entity16 's prosperity did n't survive its bloody history			1
the city has , over the centuries , shifted in ethnic , cultural and political make - up - mixing @entity3 , @entity18 , @entity67 and other identities during a series of gruesome upheavals			1
" here regimes changed quite a lot , " said @entity39			0
" we had the @entity3 rule , then the @entity4 rule , then for a short period the @entity59 , then the @entity76 , then @entity59 , then @entity77			2
" then for almost 50 years @entity16 was swallowed by the @entity5			1
with that , concludes @entity39 , the city was condemned to relative obscurity			1
but very recently things have started to change -- and fast			0
according to research from the @entity83 of hotel business , @entity16 experienced a sudden 40 % increase in tourism in early 2010 , compared to the previous three - year average			1
this , it said , was the highest rate in @entity1			0
just last month , the floodgates opened even wider , when @entity16 became a host city for the @entity94 football championships			1
so how has this happened ? with the @entity5 's collapse , some saw new opportunities for reviving @entity16 's former wealth and fame			1
in the mid 90s , @entity101 began producing women 's clothes , paying his workers $ 4 a month			0
today they get a vastly improved , but still modest , $ 250			0
with nine factories across western @entity18 , his company , @entity107 , is now a major producer and exporter for @entity1 fashion labels			2
" i 'm proud because @entity113 , after the @entity112 , started from blouses as well			0
and where is @entity113 now ? " he said			0
the unlikely parallels do n't end there			0
strolling through @entity16 's old streets , you 'd never guess the city is now a booming international hub for the @entity123 industry			1
limelight networks is a @entity127 - founded , @entity126 - listed company specializing in online content delivery			0
it 's one of many up - and - coming digital tech firms to have opened offices in @entity16 over the past few years			1
" it had good growth and experience in the @entity127 , however the company needs more talent to do the new cool projects and products for our customers			0
this is why we 're here in @entity18			2
" @entity16 's unexpected abundance of @entity123 talent is in fact a legacy of the @entity5 to help the military , many @entity5 universities focused on turning out world - class engineers and @entity16 's university is still producing them			1
the city boasts a disproportionately large educational center with 23 higher education institutions			1
most tellingly of all , seven of these are dedicated to training support staff for work in the tourism industry			0
it 's clear the city of @entity16 does not intend to remain a hidden gem for very much longer .			2

since @entity94 , little - known @entity18 " capital of culture " @entity16 put back on *map*
city boasts architecture from renaissance and baroque eras , built during wealthy past
after 50 years of @entity5 rule , @entity16 fell into relative obscurity , but strong education *system* reviving fortunes
