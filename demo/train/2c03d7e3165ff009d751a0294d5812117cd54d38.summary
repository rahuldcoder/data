-- tonight , as my husband stands in our bedroom , fingers whirling across his smartphone and eyes glued to its tiny screen , i have no idea " where " he is			2
is he checking the score of his beloved home team , or dealing with a rant from an indefatigable boss overseas ? is he working or home - ing , or both ? this melding of work and home , of course , is an old story			1
in 1999 , i wrote an article about three generations of a @entity25 family and their work - life balance			1
shattering my romantic views on what it was like to live a few easy steps from work -- literally over the store -- the family 's elderly patriarch told me that his parents could n't wait to move to the suburbs and put some distance between family and work			2
their hardware business had shadowed their evenings and weekends , stealing peace			0
decades later , the patriarch 's restless , cell phone - toting , entrepreneurial son blamed the portability of work for his recent divorce			1
how smartphones make us superhuman in the digital age , we blend home and work , not because we are tied to a store or farm or job , but because the fetters of time and space seem shattered			1
we can physically circuit the globe in hours , and our thoughts can move across the planet in seconds			0
@entity65 seems putty in our hands			0
our lives are increasingly shorn of context			0
my early days in the mobile revolution does it matter much whether it 's night or day , spring or fall , home or the office ? we are empowered , yet disturbed by this free - for - all			1
two recent reports underscore the tensions within these shifts			0
while more companies are allowing employees to work when and where they want to , they increasingly are limiting people 's ability to take a leave or work part - time , the @entity79 and @entity80 found in its 2012 @entity87			1
flex - time is up , but career breaks have fallen steeply			2
more than half of executives get business information at all hours , according to a survey released earlier this year by @entity94 and an advertising firm			0
as many executives reported feeling enabled as irritated by an " @entity97			0
" nearly a third of those executives who feel " in control " of their always - on lives also describe themselves as resigned to the situation			2
is overwork the trouble ? yes and no. in a blended world , work does tend to win out over other parts of life			1
studies over the past decade show that people who work at home or outside the office tend to work longer hours , contrary to employers ' initial fears			1
according to a recent survey , 54 % of @entity114 smartphone owners check their phones in bed -- sometimes in the middle of the night			0
and at a @entity123 marketers ' networking luncheon where i recently spoke on a panel , a majority of the crowd of 150 reported , in a show of hands , that they sleep with a smartphone within reach			0
even if work is our passion , as it is mine , we 're pitching ourselves headlong and unthinkingly into a world without boundaries -- a world without rest			1
but overwork is perhaps the least of the challenges when we blend work and home			1
the blending itself changes how we work , as well as how long we work			2
in frantically integrating work and home , we stray perilously close to diluting both			1
this is a matter of attention , intention , and depth			0
in courting the always - on livelihood , we 're turning our backs on rich moments of full focus and absorption , in favor of darting restlessly back and forth between two or more complex streams of life			1
the integrity of a moment is lost when we unthinkingly blend different parts of our life			1
i 'm writing this on a sunday			0
my teen is sleeping in and my husband is away			0
the silence of the morning provides a perfect context for writing			0
but when my groggy teen wakes up , i 'll put aside my work , and we 'll share toast and tea and a plan of the day			2
because if i tried to skate through breakfast with one eye on my daughter and one eye on the clock or smartphone , a fleeting moment of togetherness would be diluted			0
the silken threads of mutual presence would be thinned to the point of fraying			0
as much as we try to believe otherwise , it matters where we are			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			1

@entity189 : we blend home and work because we all use smartphones
@entity194 : we are empowered , yet disturbed by this free - for - all
she says that in a mobile world , work tends to win out over other parts of life
@entity194 : as much as we try to believe otherwise , it matters what we do , where we are
