-- @entity2 president @entity1 continues to shuffle his top military commanders as he tries to make good on his recent promise to cleanse the government of corruption			1
@entity2 president @entity1 has faced political pressure to act on government corruption			1
after firing 700 police officers and forcing the retirement of 31 military and police generals sunday , @entity1 on monday removed more generals and reassigned others			1
the government also has announced that more than 535 members of the nation 's 24,000 - strong military have been forced out in the past six months due to their suspected involvement in the drug trade			1
among the generals forced to retire was the former head of the nation 's top anti-drug agency , the @entity26 , known by its @entity29 acronym @entity27			2
in his state - of - the - nation speech friday , @entity1 said , " in the @entity2 -- listen well -- narcotrafficking will not pass			1
" despite the president 's strong words , many @entity2 citizens and outside analysts said narcotrafficking already has taken hold			1
" the situation in the @entity2 is that organizations that are supposedly involved in fighting corruption and narcotrafficking are involved in it , " said @entity37 , an anti-corruption attorney for 25 years in @entity38 , the capital			1
@entity42 , a regional manager for @entity43 at @entity45 - based @entity44 , which helps companies assess and deal with dangers abroad , said , " the security forces -- the army and the police -- have been corrupted			1
" the @entity2 government generally carries out military promotions and retirements on february 27 , the day in which the nation celebrates its 1844 declaration of independence from @entity58			1
but this year 's numbers are unprecedented , @entity59 said			0
in 1978 , he said , 48 generals were let go -- some for perceived corruption , others for political reasons			1
but @entity59 said he never has seen 700 police officers fired or more than 500 military personnel relieved of their duties			1
" in the majority of cases , " he said , " there has to be something linking that person to narcotrafficking or corruption in general			2
" national police chief @entity77 addressed his force monday , admonishing them not to cave in to the many temptations they face			0
" today , more than ever , harassed by increasingly demanding challenges that jump out from all sides , just when drug trafficking persists in crippling society , it 's time for all police agents and officers , the men and women of our dear institution ... to raise our chest , since this is the moment to define ourselves			2
we 're with the nation or we 're against it , " he was quoted as saying in the @entity95 and @entity97 newspaper web sites			0
@entity59 and others said police and the military have been involved in organized crime " for a long time			2
" the evidence lies in the lavish lifestyles many of these officials are able to sustain on a public salary , they said			0
" they live in contradiction with their salaries , " @entity59 said			0
" they live in houses that cost millions of pesos and drive big vehicles			0
" corrupt officials prefer to work in customs , at the airport and the border and in anti-drug units , the lawyer said			0
they receive bribes from traffickers , @entity59 said , and also profit by arresting people involved in the drug trade and taking their possessions			0
@entity59 , a well - known attorney in a nation of less than 10 million , has represented drug suspects and has argued cases before the @entity2 @entity131			1
in 2000 , a published report said , he filed a suit against @entity1 alleging padded road - construction contracts			1
@entity42 , the risk analyst , notes that @entity137 routes for drug shipments have diminished due to strong interdiction efforts by the @entity140			0
the majority of shipments now travel through @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , he said			0
however , @entity42 and others said , the drug trade still flourishes in the @entity2			2
" the @entity2 is not a major drug - producing country , but it acts as a transit point for cocaine , heroin , marijuana and ecstasy bound for the @entity158 and @entity159 , " said @entity148 , a publication that offers country - by - country risk analysis			1
" the main trafficking routes are by sea from @entity162 , and the drugs are then transferred by go - fast boats to islands such as @entity166 and @entity167 , on the way to the @entity158 " the indexmundi web site , which offers analyses on nations worldwide , said the @entity2 has become " a trans - shipment point for ecstasy from the @entity174 and @entity175 destined for the @entity158 and @entity176			1
" @entity177 's and indexmundi point out that substantial money - laundering also takes place in the @entity2			1
deteriorating conditions in @entity58 , with which the @entity2 shares a 193 - mile border , have led traffickers to go next door			1
" @entity58 was the place where drugs used to come through , " @entity42 said			0
" some of this now has shifted to the @entity2			2
" drug use in the @entity2 also has shifted			0
@entity191 , a reporter for the @entity97 newspaper who has been covering corruption cases , relates what many @entity2 say : " before , it used to come in and it would go			2
now , it 's not like that			0
it comes in and it stays			0
" @entity42 points out that tourism creates a demand for drugs			0
" tourism is a huge thing in the @entity2			0
local consumption has definitely gone up			0
" and large @entity2 communities in the @entity158 and @entity166 " create a natural connection " for drug smuggling into those countries , @entity42 said			0
federal officials in @entity212 have been battling -- and indicting -- @entity2 natives on drug charges for years			2
some observers see @entity1 's crackdown as a sign that he is getting serious			0
" @entity1 is trying to weed out corruption , " said @entity218 , a @entity43 analyst also with @entity44			2
others , such as the lawyer @entity59 , said @entity1 was forced to act after public outcry concerning the shootings deaths in august of seven @entity224 in a drug - related case			2
a high - level commission appointed by @entity1 concluded that low - and midlevel officials from the national police were involved			1
but many @entity2 said they believe higher - ranking officers were responsible and the political pressure has been mounting on @entity1 to act			1
and many observers do n't expect this will be the last of it .			0
