-- big day reveal or @entity3 preview ? that 's the question marketers face as they decide when to release their much - anticipated @entity7 commercials			1
@entity8 recently reported ads that ran online before the @entity7 received 9 million views , compared to 1.3 million views for ads that debuted during the big game			1
generating buzz and going viral are two measures of success			2
in 2012 , more than 13.7 million @entity7 - related tweets were posted during the big game and this year that figure is expected to be higher			1
last year , the top ad hashtags were # solongvampires , # makeitplatinum and # beckhamforhm			1
does anyone remember what those were for ? no matter			2
it 's a new year ! here are some of the @entity7 ads currently creating big buzz ... @entity34 ad - the @entity36 man with the @entity38 accent spreading happiness by channeling @entity40 is the theme of this @entity34 commercial , which has generated some controversy			1
while some online discussions question whether the use of a @entity38 accent by a white guy from the " @entity36 " is offensive , commenters on the @entity34 @entity3 page say @entity38 come in all colors			1
" i think it 's great , funny and a compliment to the @entity55 no worries feel happy way of life ! " wrote user rebelphoto			1
" i myself am not @entity38 but work with a good friend who is and i just love the sound of his dialect and the way he spreads his happiness when we are demoralized , just like the guy in the ad			2
i love @entity68 , anyone offended by this ad should watch it and listen closer			2
" the @entity71 , a newspaper in @entity72 , @entity38 , posed the question to their @entity75 fans , who mostly agreed the ad was not racist			0
" there is nothing wrong with this ad it 's not racist , " said @entity77			2
" how many @entity38 speak like @entity82 ? " watch the @entity34 ad @entity85 ad - race across the desert a @entity85 commercial featuring a race among outlaw cowboys , aggressive showgirls with glitter bombs and scavenging badlanders to reach a giant bottle of soda seems harmless enough			0
but it 's the lone @entity96 character leading his camels through the desert who is overtaken by the race participants that has at least one @entity96 - @entity82 group asking for the character to be edited out			2
@entity105 , president of the @entity106 told @entity107 on wednesday the commercial is racist			0
a @entity85 spokeswoman said the characters are a nod to movies of the past			0
there has n't been much reaction on @entity116			0
on @entity119 's @entity3 page , @entity117 said , " i 'm @entity96 and i do n't find this racist only because i do n't allow myself or anyone to lower my people 's standards			2
i 'm smart enough to know that not every @entity96 is a @entity124 with a camel and not every @entity82 is a cowboy or show dancer ...			0
now can we worry about more important things in life already ? ! ! ! " watch the @entity85 ad @entity133 ad - blond bombshell washes car ... in slow motion the sexy , sudsy @entity137 video for @entity133 that released last week gave audiences a peek at the direction the luxury carmaker was heading for the @entity7			1
on wednesday , @entity133 released the full spot , which features @entity143 and @entity144 in addition to @entity146			0
sadly for some , it contains fewer suds , but more fantasy			0
watch the @entity133 ad @entity151 ad - it 's for underwear , right ? and while we 're talking about sexy , @entity151 's preview featuring male model @entity154 prompted this response from @entity3 viewer omgboyplex , " best			1
" watch the @entity151 preview @entity160 ad - kiss the prom queen would a teen really go to the prom -- in a tuxedo -- by himself ? probably not			0
but @entity7 ads are definitely not about reality			1
this @entity160 commercial challenges viewers to " @entity167			0
it 's what defines us			2
" oh , and by the way , you could end up with a black eye			0
but it 's totally worth it			1
watch the @entity160 ad @entity179 - your wish is my command @entity182 struts around everyday @entity82 as a purple genie granting your spoken and unspoken wishes in this @entity186 commercial that pairs talking squirrels with space travel			0
@entity182 has been tweeting about the commercial , and although the hashtag # wishgranted has n't gotten much buzz ahead of sunday 's game , at least one person wished for a hobbit plane			1
watch the @entity179 ad @entity197 - what 's in a name ? beer + baby animals ? @entity197 launched a @entity116 contest to name the @entity204 foal that will be featured in its @entity7 ad			1
the foal will be seven days old on the day of the big game			1
not old enough to drink or vote , but we 're hoping old enough to refuse some of these suggested names : harmonica , @entity210 and @entity211			0
submit your vote @entity214 - @entity215 ... and a planet speaking of baby animals and humans , this panicked dad tries to explain to his young son where babies come from by inventing an elaborate story about the planet @entity225			0
in the end , he is saved by a feature in his @entity228 that plays music on demand			0
watch the @entity228 ad @entity232 might not want to watch with grandma twitter user @ renillawafer14 says her least favorite part of the @entity7 is the " slutty @entity238 commercials where you just look around at your family like ... ... " well @entity242 , it 's not likely to be any less uncomfortable this year if these are really the commercials they are planning to air			1
