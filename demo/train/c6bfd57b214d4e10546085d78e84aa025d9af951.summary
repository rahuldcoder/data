-- it 's been three years since @entity2 was hit with its worst - ever earthquake , causing serious damage to @entity6 nuclear power plant			1
the 9 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami sent three of @entity6 's reactors into melt - down , shocking the world			2
@entity2 , a fully industrialized country with high safety requirements , was facing a nuclear disaster of a similar scale to the deadly 1986 @entity16 accident , in @entity17			1
as a result , many countries decided to review their energy policies			0
before the accident , 442 nuclear power reactors in 30 countries produced 14 % of all world 's electricity			1
this number dropped to just 11 % in 2012 , as 15 reactors exited service -- mainly in @entity29 and @entity2			1
today , 435 reactors operate in 31 countries , and a further 68 are under construction			0
after the @entity6 disaster , @entity2 pulled back its nuclear ambitions , ordered large - scale inspections and introduced new safety regulations			2
all of its 48 remaining reactors have been kept offline and a proposal to restart the program awaits parliament 's approval			0
@entity29 shut down eight of its oldest reactors almost immediately after @entity6 , focusing instead on renewable energy , and phase - out all of its nuclear power by 2022			1
@entity47 adopted a similar approach when the government decided not to build any new reactors and phase out its nuclear production by 2034			2
this was despite a national referendum in which a majority of people voted in favor of more reactors			0
but not all countries got scared			0
both @entity59 , which has the world 's highest share of nuclear power for its electricity production , and the @entity64 , the world 's largest producer , reaffirmed their positions on the power source			1
both countries continue to invest heavily into safety improvements			0
all four " @entity73 " countries are boosting their nuclear power production , with @entity75 aiming to supply 25 % and @entity76 45 % of their electricity from nuclear power by 2050 , and @entity80 planning to build five new reactors by 2030			1
@entity82 is facing pressure to cut its pollution levels and reliance on coal			0
@entity82 already operates 20 reactors and aims to more than triple its nuclear capacity by 2020			2

for the purpose of this report , @entity0 used @entity104 data and considered only the reactors connected to the grid and supplying electricity to consumers as active .			0

the *fukushima* nuclear disaster *changed* attitudes towards nuclear power
@entity29 shut down its oldest reactors and plans to phase - out nuclear by 2022
*emerging* *markets* are investing heavily into nuclear power
