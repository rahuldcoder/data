-- @entity1 have qualified for the @entity3 finals , but they had troubled striker @entity4 sent off , and squandered a two - goal lead , to draw 2 - 2 in @entity6 on friday			1
@entity8 's side only needed a point to seal their place from @entity11 and looked in complete control when @entity13 headed home @entity15 's cross , before @entity13 turned provider to set up @entity18 with an easy finish			2
however , @entity6 pulled a goal back on the stroke of half - time with a deflected @entity24 effort , before @entity4 was shown a straight red card in the second half for kicking out at defender @entity27			1
and the home side took advantage of their man advantage to snatch a last - gasp draw when @entity32 headed home @entity34 's far post cross			2
the result secured @entity1 's qualification with 18 points from their completed eight matches , but it has come at a cost with @entity4 -- who had to contend with his father and uncle being arrested earlier in the week over a betting fraud allegation -- now being suspended for at least the first match of the finals tournament			1
it proved to be an important equalizer for @entity6 , who have secured second spot and a place in the play - offs on 12 points			2
@entity54 lost 2 - 0 in @entity55 in the other group match to end their hopes of reaching the finals via the play - offs			1
@entity61 moved a step closer to sealing qualification with a vital 1 - 0 @entity65 success in @entity66			1
@entity68 midfielder @entity67 scored the only goal with 20 minutes remaining , as @entity61 moved top of the group with 20 points			2
they will ensure qualification if they draw with group minnows @entity75 in their final match , while @entity78 's defeat means they can not now qualify via the play - offs			1
@entity80 won 2 - 0 in @entity75 , thanks to goals from @entity83 and @entity84 , and lie second on 18 points , one ahead of @entity86 who thrashed @entity88 4 - 1 in @entity89			1
@entity90 and @entity86 will meet in the final group game in @entity92 , with @entity90 just needing a draw to secure a play - off place			2
in @entity96 , @entity95 secured their place in the play - offs with a 2 - 1 victory at rivals @entity101 in @entity102			1
two players who ply their trade in @entity1 , @entity104 's @entity103 and @entity105 of @entity106 put the visitors in the ascendancy and their held on for victory despite @entity112 pulling a goal back for the home side			0
in the other group match , a goal five minutes before half - time from @entity116 gave the already - qualified @entity119 a 1 - 0 home win over @entity121 in @entity122			1
that means the @entity124 maintain their 100 % record in the group with nine wins out of nine			0
they lie on 27 points , six ahead of @entity95 who must travel to the @entity119 in their final group game			0
@entity132 are a further three points behind in third and can draw level on points with @entity95 , but the @entity137 are certain of a play - off place courtesy of a greater head - to - head record			0
@entity140 also maintained their perfect nine from nine record with a superb 3 - 1 @entity144 victory over @entity145 in @entity146			2
in - form @entity148 striker @entity147 opened the scoring with his 13th goal of the season and club team - mate @entity153 added a second after being set - up by @entity156			0
@entity157 pulled a goal back for @entity145 with 10 minutes remaining but @entity159 converted a late penalty , after @entity161 had fouled @entity153 , to seal the win			0
the win puts @entity140 on 27 points , a massive 12 points ahead of @entity166 , who have leapfrogged @entity145 into second place after defeating @entity169 4 - 1 in @entity170			1
however , @entity145 are just a point behind @entity166 and are still favorites to claim the play - off place as they entertain @entity175 in their final match , while @entity166 have to win in @entity140 to clinch second spot			1
@entity178 will finish fourth in the group after they won 4 - 1 in @entity175 on friday			0
holders @entity181 are the other team to remain 100 % after beating the @entity183 2 - 0 in @entity184 for a seventh consecutive @entity186 success			1
first - half goals from @entity188 and @entity189 proved enough for the @entity191 and world champions , who now have 21 points with one match remaining			0
