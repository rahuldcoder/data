@entity0 , @entity1 -- for years , an ancient tribe of semi-nomadic herders known as the @entity5 has drawn photographers to @entity1 's barren northwest			1
as a result , the striking image of the @entity5 -- if not their name -- has become known far beyond the remote , unforgiving @entity0 region where they eke out a living tending livestock			1
the reason for this is otjize , a paste of butter , fat and red ochre -- sometimes scented with aromatic resin -- that @entity5 women apply each morning to their skin and hair , giving them a distinctive red hue			1
the sight of traditional @entity5 women has become an iconic image of @entity31			1
there has been much speculation about the origins of this practice , with some claiming it is to protect their skin from the sun , or repel insects			2
but the @entity5 say it is an aesthetic consideration , a sort of traditional make - up they apply every morning when they wake			1
men do not apply otjize			0
although it is constantly jeopardized by development , including proposed hydroelectric projects , many @entity5 lead a traditional lifestyle that has remained unchanged for generations , surviving war and droughts			2
these customs can be glimpsed today in the village of @entity57 , where around 20 people live under the leadership of chief @entity60			0
the @entity5 are open to outsiders coming to witness their way of life , but ask for a contribution from visitors in return -- in this case , maize , coffee , tea , cooking oil and $ 25 donation			2
as pastoralists , cattle are central to the lives of the @entity5 -- just like their relatives , the @entity77 , who are renowned for the headwear of their women , which resemble cattle horns			1

every morning , after the women have applied their otjize , they milk the cattle , before the young men of the village lead them out to graze			1
if there is nowhere to graze , the village may relocate , or the young men set up a temporary village with their stock			0
the past year has been dry , says @entity104 , one of the chief 's wives , and the village is concerned about the welfare of their livestock			0
" last year , it rain ( ed ) a lot and i was very comfortable			0
this year , i do n't know what to say ... i pray to @entity115 as the animals are dying			0
" the homes of the @entity5 , who number between 30,000 and 50,000 , are round structures constructed of sapling posts , bound together to form a domed roof which is plastered in mud and dung			2
the most important part of the @entity5 village is the " okuruwo , " or holy fire			1
kept continuously alight , the holy fire represents the ancestors of the villagers , who acts as intermediaries to the @entity5 's god , @entity133			1
the chief 's is the only house whose the entrance faces the fire -- all the others face away -- and it is important for outsiders not to walk in the sacred area between his house and the fire			0
read also : ' @entity146 skulls return to @entity1 at night , an ember from the fire is brought into the chief 's hut , then used to kindle the flames again in the morning			1
chief @entity60 said he would regularly sit by the fire to interact with his ancestors			2
" we pray for rain to come and our cattle to multiply , " he said			0
" he must bless me with more followers as a chief			0
" said his wife , @entity104			0
" this is the place we pray to our @entity115 in heaven			0
in this place , you can get healed			0
