@entity0 , @entity1 -- a severe rabies epidemic has claimed the lives of at least 83 children within three months in @entity7 's capital , @entity8 , the @entity2 has said			1
@entity8 , which has a large population of stray dogs , also has some of the world 's worst slums			0
describing the situation as " very worrying , " @entity2 rabies expert @entity13 told @entity15 : " this is a huge number and could be the tip of the iceberg			1
" a doctor working at the country 's biggest referral hospital @entity19 said staff were unable to save any of the children as rabies vaccines had run out			1
some of the children were also brought into the hospital too late to be saved , @entity26 , head of the hospital told @entity31 humanitarian organization @entity30			2
he warned that the number of deaths could be much higher			0
" the children were brought to our hospital and are the only ones we know of , so the number could be higher , " @entity26 told @entity30			0
" it is a sad moment for us , " he added			0
" i think it was probably that no one was prepared for such a high case load			0
" the number of cases has now started declining , however , said @entity26			0
according to @entity13 , this could be because the current infected pack of dogs has died			2
@entity13 told @entity15 that the @entity7 government needed to embark on a dog rabies control program urgently to prevent further outbreaks			1
@entity7 's capital , where most of the population live in slums , has a large number of stray dogs who are said to have caused the epidemic			1
" we have had some sporadic cases in other provincial capitals in the country ; we think the virus was brought into @entity8 and then spread through the dogs -- @entity7 love dogs , " @entity26 said			2
" when the first 10 deaths were reported in december 2008 we alerted the authorities , but we do not have veterinary services in the city , no kennels [ to keep and observe the animals ] and vaccinate them , " he added			0
another problem contributing to the crisis is that vaccines are too expensive for the average family			0
" one dose of vaccine costs about $ 10 and five of those have to be administered , which makes the total cost of treatment $ 50 which is more than a month 's salary for families in most developing countries , " @entity13 added			2
in 2008 the @entity2 wrote that rabies , a disease transmitted from animals with infected saliva to humans , is present on nearly every continent of the world but more that 95 per cent of human deaths occur in @entity87 and @entity88			1
it can be prevented by vaccination , either prior to exposure or as part of post-exposure treatment			0
but once symptoms of the disease develop , rabies is fatal			1
according to the @entity2 , rabies can affect the lungs , stomach and central nervous systems			1
in the critical stage , a victim slips into a coma and death , usually due to breathing failure			0
more than 55,000 people die of rabies each year , the @entity2 wrote , with 30 to 60 per cent of the victims of dog bites being children under the age of 15 .			1

a severe rabies epidemic has killed at least 83 children in 3 months in @entity7
@entity13 , rabies expert at the @entity2 says this is cause for serious concern
once symptoms develop , rabies is always fatal , according to the @entity2
