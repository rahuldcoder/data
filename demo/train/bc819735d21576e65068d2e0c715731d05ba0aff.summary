-- " one of the things that made @entity9 and @entity5 fall in love with each other was that he has a brilliant mind and so does she , " says @entity0 of the character she plays on " @entity2 " -- leaving no doubt that she , for one , sees unlikely drug lord @entity4 and his increasingly horrified wife @entity5 as equals			1
it 's not just talk : @entity0 's the finest female foil for a male antihero on television right now , turning in a quietly crushing performance as an intelligent , independent woman slowly getting sucked into the gravitational maw of her husband 's monstrousness			1
that conflict has led to her stunning breakdown on this week 's episode -- and to @entity5 joining the growing number of women characters on major tv dramas singled out by furious fans			1
was @entity5 's car - wash meltdown her crawlspace moment ? yeah , i think that 's a pretty fair way to look at it			1
it 's obviously the first time that anybody has seen her break like this			1
@entity9 's complete obliviousness to her emotional state in recent episodes had to have played a part in why she finally broke down			1
he used to be more attuned to her , if only to be a more effective liar , but now it 's like he 's on another planet and she 's completely alone			1
and she 's more terrified than she 's ever been in this whole thing , because she does n't know what he 's capable of			1
in playing these early episodes , whenever he comes into a room that i 'm in , there was a feeling of me wanting to move as little as possible , wanting to breathe as little as possible , almost like you 're prey and you know somebody 's looking at you through the crosshairs			1
that was the feeling of it : " maybe if i do n't make any sudden moves , maybe if i do n't speak too loudly , he wo n't do anything			2
" why do you think it was @entity71 who provoked her breakdown ? i thought that was really clever			2
despite the humorous side of their relationship -- well , humorous to the audience -- where @entity71 nitpicks and pokes at her sister all the time , i do n't think @entity71 means to do that			2
they both really love each other			2
@entity86 [ @entity87 ] and @entity88 [ @entity89 ] and i have discussed this : " where 's their family ? " you never hear about the rest of the family , the mom and dad , at all			1
we made the assumption that we did not have a particularly happy or easy childhood , and that led to the two of us sticking together , because they 're very close			2
for actors , you 've got ta sometimes fill in your backstory			2
at least that 's what i did , very specifically -- that i needed @entity71 , and i love her , and i know she does n't mean ill. but @entity5 has not been able to let this stuff out to anyone -- only her divorce lawyer			1
it 's been building up in her so much that at this point she 's like a pot about to boil over			1
@entity71 just happened to push her buttons that day			0
and both because of the closeness of their relationship , and because of who @entity71 is and how she expresses herself by rattling on			0
on that particular day , there 's not one more thing @entity5 can handle , not one more thing she can take , so she just blows her top			1
by the end of the episode , i started wondering for the very first time if @entity5 would resort to violence to escape her situation			0
what is her escape route at this point ? this is what is stressing her right now			0
during the last couple of seasons it 's like , " do i want to run away with the kids ? do i turn him into the police ? what do i do ? " it 's a constant wheel that turns in her head			1
when she realizes that he was responsible for @entity148 's death , that 's the bottom falling out of her life			1
when she walks out and she sees @entity153 watching @entity154 and they 're quoting the movie together , in light of everything else that 's happened , it 's so quietly horrifying to her that all she can do is turn around and walk back to her room			1
she knows that there 's no saying , " @entity9 , please do n't do that			1
" they 're past that			0
she 's also in a state of depression at this point , a sinking - into - yourself where the feeling is , " i do n't really want to try			1
why bother ? why bother doing anything ? " but , within that , there 's still really desperate wheels turning			1
i do n't think she cares about herself anymore -- she 's just thinking , " how can i keep my kids safe ? " she does not have the answer , but she 's definitely looking for it			1
and you know what ? she 'd do anything to ensure that			0
she is desperate enough to do anything			0
there 's been a backlash against @entity5 , something she has in common with women characters on a variety of big dramas about men who tend behave much worse than they do			1
do you have a sense of why this happens ? does it faze you at all ? some of it is still the double standard in our society -- that it 's more acceptable for a man to be this antihero badass doing all these things that break the law or are really awful			1
people watching want to be @entity9 , or they identify with him			0
he does n't have to answer to anybody			0
he does what he wants			0
there 's a fantasy element to that , i think			2
i also think that in some ways , there 's kind of a sexism to it , honestly			2
[ pauses ] i 've been told particularly , how do you say			0
non-flattering or just really vicious -- you could use the word vitriolic -- angry stuff about @entity5 , or about other female characters on other shows			0
the hatred and the vitriol and the venom and the nastiness and the attacks are so personal sometimes that it feels like , " oh gosh , ok , i get that you do n't like @entity5 , you like @entity9 , you 're on his side , but it just feels different			0
" i do n't feel like that stuff would be written about a male character			2
honestly , @entity5 is sometimes the biggest impediment to @entity9 doing whatever he wants			0
for the people who love @entity235 , who love the badass @entity9 , when @entity5 says , " no , you should n't do that , " they 're like , " what is her deal ! ? what 's wrong with her ? " [ @entity242 ] i can understand that			2
but having looked at articles that cite other female characters being attacked like this , i find it disturbing just in terms of a cultural phenomenon			0
i 'm not saying everyone who 's into the show and has an opinion is like that , but i feel there 's an element of that in there , and it 's an interesting gender issue			2
i 'm glad that people are talking about it			0
i caught up with " @entity2 " in a huge @entity262 binge , and spending that much time in that world messed me up , emotionally			1
how do you feel at the end of shooting a season ? pretty much the same way			0
[ @entity242 ] after we shoot certain scenes , i feel like i need to take a shower			2
a long , hot one			0
i 've got about a thirty - minute ride home from the studio to where i live in @entity275 , so that ride is important			0
music is selected carefully to help me shed it			0
sometimes in watching the episode , i will start to feel , in my body , the way i felt when i was filming the scene			0
like at the end of @entity283 , where @entity9 climbs in the bed next to @entity5 -- i felt this feeling of [ makes gagging sound ] in my body , the same feeling that was going on during the filming it			0
i ca n't watch it too close to bedtime			0
