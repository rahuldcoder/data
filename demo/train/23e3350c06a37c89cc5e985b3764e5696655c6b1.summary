-- @entity1 was a man of immense literary talent , some of which he used well , some of which he wasted			1
his essays are widely thought to be his best work			2
two of his historical novels , " @entity10 " and " @entity12 " are gems			2
the more widely read and prize - winning " @entity15 " ruffled @entity15 scholars and many @entity16 , who objected to @entity1 's depiction of our 16th president as a ruthless proto - fascist intent on crushing the @entity21 and transforming the small government @entity16 republic into a version of @entity26 's @entity25			1
but @entity1 loved to be a polemicist and he valued imagination and vision , especially his own , more than he valued fact			1
indeed his great talent for satiric wit , which perhaps brought him more fame than either his writing or his brief political career , exhibited how much more he valued wit than truth			1
his death removes a man who loved his country so much that sometimes he hated it , and who loved no one , even himself			1
@entity45 was not a feature of human life that he had much interest in or sympathy for			2
he was mainly preoccupied with power and justice in the individual life , in the community and in the historical perspective			2
he was not shy about saying that behind his icy exterior was an icy interior			2
shy is the wrong word			2
he was not shy about anything			0
i got to know @entity1 quite well , up front and personal , his magnificent strengths and his appalling , almost other - worldly weaknesses			1
one day in the mid- 1990s i got a call from @entity1 's literary executor , asking if i would be interested in writing his biography			1
all my biographical subjects had been long dead literary greats			1
@entity1 had looked at my bios of @entity71 and @entity72			1
he liked the idea of being in such company			0
news : @entity1 , chronicler of @entity16 life and politics , dies still , i hesitated			1
@entity1 had the reputation of being a man used to getting his way			1
what if he attempted to exercise control over the manuscript and to pressure me to write it to suit him ? at my request and on the basis of a draft i provided , he wrote a letter stating that he would give me complete cooperation and not attempt at any stage to vet the manuscript			1
he would not see the book until it was published			0
as soon as we could clear our schedules , we began six months of intensive interviews at his home in @entity98 and on the phone			0
he enjoyed fine dining and drinking , and he was disappointed that at the time i was a nondrinker			0
he made up for my abstinence , and the @entity1 who verged on alcoholism and who went to fat farms to work off dozens of pounds before doing a book tour called me at any hour , his speech slightly slurred , to make another point or simply to talk			1
opinion : my friend , il maestro @entity1 he was not a conversationalist			1
he was a magnificent monologist			0
with a deep , mellifluous voice , a sharp witty tongue and a wide range of anecdotes about himself and famous people he had known and knew , he commanded the stage			0
at his best he was riveting , though often with a touch of the pompous			0
for @entity1 , charm and charisma , like his voice , were tools in an arsenal			1
he had a deep , unquestioned faith in his ability to get his own way			0
where he succeeded most was in his writing and his spontaneous interviews			0
in his attempt at a political career , pursuing the nomination of the @entity140 party for the governorship of @entity142 in 1982 , his tools failed him			0
charm and charisma did n't work			1
he was too much the cultured patrician to be a viable candidate			0
there was no way he could be elected to high office			0
news : a dozen thoughts from @entity1 he made another misjudgment when he moved to @entity151 in the late 1960s			1
he could never understand why @entity152 and @entity153 had more presence on the @entity16 literary scene than he did			2
it was , i suggested , because he lived in @entity151			0
in the @entity159 days , that was like living on another planet			0
@entity16 want their writers to be in @entity16			0
he preferred the attractions of @entity151			0
@entity1 also preferred to pay for sex			1
he met his long - time companion , @entity165 , in a @entity167 bath house			0
he later stated a number of times that they never had sex , which is why they could have such a long relationship			0
@entity1 was vain and delighted in his physical good looks until he lost them			1
he loved to be photographed			2
whatever room he walked into , he thought himself the most important man in the room			0
he sometimes was not , but he was usually the most interesting			0
@entity178 , narcissism , pomposity , the preference for wit and personal vision above truth , his love of celebrity and celebrities -- all that fades away , as do the failings of the two writers he felt most competitive with and trashed often , @entity152 and @entity153			1
what remains is a large body of literary work : the insignificant but respectable work for stage , movies and television ; the paranoid political fulminations of his later years ; the wonderful variety of historical novels ; the satiric novels about sex and religion , like " @entity203 " and " live from @entity204 ; " the imaginative and wicked fantasy novels like " @entity206 ; " and the wonderful collected essays that reveal a mastery of the essay tone that places him almost in the company of @entity211 and @entity212			2
in my own view , he should have stuck to literature , he should not have alienated so many people , he should have given higher value to truth than wit , and he should have found ways to value if not to love those who were ready to love him			1
in my case , the tiny affair was over when he called me , just before the biography was to go to press , and demanded to vet the manuscript as if the agreement we had put in writing did not exist			2
i was disappointed but not surprised			0
most of his people relationships ended that way			0
but he did have and still has an ongoing significant relationship with literary history , and he deserves more than a footnote , or at least a very long footnote , in discussions of the @entity16 scene and @entity16 culture between 1960 and 1990			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			1

@entity243 : @entity1 had huge literary talent , some well used , some wasted
his satire showed how he prized wit , vision over truth , he says . he loved celebrity
he says he wrote biography of @entity1 , saw his charm , pomposity , inability to love
@entity261 : @entity1 a brilliant essayist , should have stuck to literature , his enduring *legacy*
