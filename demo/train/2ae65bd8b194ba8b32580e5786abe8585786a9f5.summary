@entity0 never thought he 'd be tending goal at this point in his life			1
not just because he 's 50 , but because 16 years ago he was having so much pain in his hands and feet he could n't walk across a parking lot , let alone put his feet in a pair of skates or drop to his knees to stop a puck			1
like many @entity13 , @entity0 started playing hockey as a kid			1
when he grew up he wanted to be @entity16			2
he played through high school and college , but knew he was n't good enough to realize his @entity20 dreams			1
so he moved on in life			2
he started a graphics business , got married and settling down in @entity23			2
his hockey gear , it collected dust in the closet			2
in 1998 he started having unexplained pain			1
it was so severe that nothing could touch his joints			2
" once the symptoms started they were pretty debilitating , " he remembers			2
after a series of doctor 's visits and tests , he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis			1
doctors were able to find a medication that worked for him			0
by 2002 , he felt so great that while watching his home @entity20 team , the @entity43 , he made a decision			1
the team was horrible that year and in watching them struggle motivated him			1
he would get back on the ice			0
" one night it just flipped a switch and it just went , i wan na go do this again , " he says			0
the next day @entity0 says he unearthed his old goalie gear from the 1980s			1
he dusted it off and headed to the rink			0
he decided he wanted to be a goalie			0
there was a learning curve though			0
the modern techniques goalies used were different from when he was a kid			0
he must have been a quick study , because his style of playing caught the attention of some coaches along the way			0
they invited him to play in an elite group of hockey players in the @entity23 area			0
that led to an invitation to training camp for the minor league team called the @entity72			1
@entity0 made the cut and was tapped as the @entity76 hokey league team 's backup goalie			1
quickly he was blocking shots from players half his age			0
he 's always ready to step in whenever one of the teams ' goalies is injured or when the team 's goalie would called up to the majors			1
today he 's retired from minor league play			0
but he still feels good enough to play			0
he fills in on goalie when they need one for team practice			1
he mentors many of his much younger teammates and works as a player liaison			0
that time playing with the @entity72 has left its mark			0
@entity0 remembers taking it all in as he dressed for his first professional game in november 2011			1
" it was a profound experience , " @entity0 says			1
his mission now is to remind the young guys how lucky they are to have landed a coveted spot on a team			2
" when i first started doing this i was 47 and i never would have believed that i would have had an opportunity like this , " he says			0
to him , his ability to play , even for a short amount of time , it is a true gift .			0

@entity0 suffered terrible arthritis pain and could n't walk
his @entity20 team the @entity43 were having a terrible *season*
