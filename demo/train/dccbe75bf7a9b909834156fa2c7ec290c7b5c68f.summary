among other things , @entity2 said the @entity3 is raising the threshold for what constitutes an appropriate level of information necessary to launch a " credible inquiry " into allegations of homosexual behavior			1
the change , which will take effect in 30 days and apply to all current cases , is a reflection of " common sense " and " common decency , " @entity2 said			1
" these changes reflect some of the insights we have gained over 17 years of implementing the current law , including the need for consistency , oversight and clear standards			0
" president @entity30 and adm. @entity31 , chairman of the @entity32 , support a legislative repeal of " @entity34 , " which was first enacted in 1993			1
some senior members of the military , however , have expressed concern over the impact of the ban 's repeal on unit cohesion and morale , among other things			1
is this the right move ? share your thoughts last month , @entity2 announced the @entity3 had taken the first steps to prepare for a repeal of the policy			1
laying the groundwork for such a change will take more than a year , he said			2
in the interim , he said , the @entity3 will start enforcing the policy " in a fairer manner			2
" @entity2 said thursday that , moving ahead : the @entity3 will raise the level of the officer authorized to start a fact - finding inquiry or separation proceeding as a result of alleged homosexual conduct to a general or flag officer in the accused service member 's chain of command			1

only a general or flag officer in an accused service member 's chain of command will be authorized to initiate expulsion proceedings			0

for example , @entity2 , said , the @entity3 will specify that information given by third parties should be given under oath			1
the use of " overheard statements " and " hearsay " will be discouraged			0
the @entity3 will revise what constitutes a " reliable person " upon which an inquiry can be initiated			0
according to @entity2 , " special scrutiny " will be given to " third parties who may be motivated to harm a service member			2
" certain categories of confidential information will no longer be used in discharge proceedings , including information provided to lawyers , clergy and psychotherapists			0
information provided to a doctor as part of a service member 's medical treatment or to a medical official in the course of a public health inquiry also will not be used in discharge proceedings			0
information given for either a security clearance investigation or in the course of seeking professional assistance for domestic or physical abuse also will be excluded			0
last month , @entity2 told members of the @entity114 that " a guiding principle of our efforts [ to change the policy on gays in the military ] will be to minimize disruption and polarization within the ranks , with special attention paid to those serving on the front lines			1
" @entity2 also said the @entity3 will ask the @entity127 to update a study it conducted in 1993 on the impact of allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military			1
since the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy was implemented , more than 13,500 service members have been discharged , according to @entity135 rep. @entity134 , @entity136			2
in 2009 , there were 428 discharges under the policy , the lowest rate of discharge since implementation , he said			2

sixty - nine percent of @entity135 believe openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military , according to a february 12 - 15 @entity147 poll			2
twenty - seven percent are opposed to such a change , the survey found			0
in 1994 , shortly after the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy was implemented , 53 percent of @entity135 believed openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military , while 41 percent were opposed			1
