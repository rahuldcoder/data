later in the day , @entity20 will conduct a public giveaway for 250 winners for a post-parade ceremony on tuesday at @entity24 where the team will be given keys to the city			2

the go - ahead touchdown was scored by running back @entity44 from 6 yards out with 52 seconds remaining			1
but the @entity7 and @entity45 , who was vying for his fourth championship ring , were n't quite done			0
they moved the ball , but had only enough time for a " @entity52 " pass that bounced away from receivers in the end zone			0

exact figures were not available early monday morning			0
as in years past , many watched as much for the ads and the halftime show as for the game itself			1
halftime entertainer @entity70 provided an eclectic set , morphing from a @entity73 theme to a high school cheerleader , complete with pom poms and a marching band			0
she led a collection of performers through a medley that included " @entity80 , " " music , " " @entity82 " and " @entity83			0
' " but it was a guest performance by artist @entity85 that generated most of the show 's buzz			1
she gave network cameras a middle finger salute , while rapping " i do n't give a sh * t. " the apologies from the @entity33 and the broadcaster , @entity94 , came quickly -- they blamed each other			1
" there was a failure in @entity94 's delay system , " said @entity96 , the league 's vice president of communications			0
" the obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate , very disappointing , and we apologize to our fans			0
" " the @entity33 hired the talent and produced the halftime show , " @entity94 said			2
" our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers			0
" the episode was reminiscent of the @entity111 when singer @entity113 's nipple was briefly exposed during a performance with singer @entity115			0
the @entity62 president who saved football a bevy of celebrities , including @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 , showed up in commercials during this year 's broadcast			0
@entity125 provided eye candy in an @entity128 underwear ad , which tended to spend more time on his chiseled and tattooed looks than the briefs he was wearing			0
another commercial featured a slimmed - down dog chasing after a @entity132			2
the ads went for a record $ 3.5 million per 30 - second spot			2
pop singer @entity135 started off the festivities with a rendition of " @entity138 , " managing to get through the lyrics without a hitch , unlike @entity141 , who caught flak after botching the words at last year 's game			2
what does @entity145 have to offer ? the city itself strove to prove it could be a major player			0
it kept one key goal in mind			0
" i honestly think the best report would be people saying , ' the game was great and -- oh yeah , by the way , @entity145 was really nice			2
i had a really good time , ' " said @entity158 , longtime co-host of the @entity160 - based syndicated radio program " the @entity161			2
