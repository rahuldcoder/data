-- we watch more than 2 billion @entity3 videos every day , but let 's admit it -- we 're usually viewing a top 25 clip , a video forwarded by a friend or an old standby like @entity9 ( some of those 66 million views must be repeats )			1
but what happens to the gazillion other videos that are uploaded to @entity3 only to languish in obscurity ? the sheer volume of stuff on @entity3 -- 24 hours of video are uploaded to the site every minute -- means that for every breakaway , million - view hit , there are thousands of clips that almost nobody ever sees			1
luckily , we now have @entity27 , a new blog that scrapes the bottom of the @entity3 barrel for the most entertainingly awful clips			1
at the time they were discovered on @entity3 and re-posted , each of these videos had attracted literally zero views			1
watch the clip " aw yo , listen , " of a bandana - covered teen doing a macarena / hip - hop solo boogie in his bedroom to @entity39 dance music			0
admire the 23 seconds of " do n't give her no meat , " featuring pet hamsters sharing a meal with a family at the dinner table			0
with new videos posted daily , @entity48 videos remind us how boring , mundane and disgusting some people can be -- something that 's easily forgotten if all you watch is popular videos			1
@entity48 democratizes the online platform			0
at worst , it 's a place to get a laugh , or maybe feel better about your own awkward attempts at @entity3 fame			2
at best , it gives equal footing to all of us -- even people who , measured solely by online viewership , nobody cares about			0
if you need to cleanse your video - watching palate afterwards , watch the " 100 greatest hits of youtube in 4 minutes " a clever compilation of skateboard wipeouts , cute babies and keyboard - playing cats			0
it 's gotten more than 7 million views			0
but after spending some time with @entity48 , the popular videos may seem a little less real .			2

the site 's videos remind us how disgusting or boring some people can be
