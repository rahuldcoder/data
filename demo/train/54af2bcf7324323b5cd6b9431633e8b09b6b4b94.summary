@entity0 -- as the @entity3 and its allies wrestle with how to respond to the possibility that the @entity7 regime used chemical weapons against its own people , a new poll for @entity1 finds @entity12 's @entity11 allies distinctly lukewarm on military intervention			1
the @entity14 are more willing than the @entity15 or the @entity16 to launch missile strikes on @entity7 , but even there , only one in three people backs bombing			1
one out of five @entity16 is in favor of missile strikes , while the number is even lower in the @entity15 , at 16 %			2
@entity14 's parliament is due to debate possible action on @entity7 on wednesday			0
last week , @entity15 's @entity26 rejected even the possibility of a military strike on @entity7 , in a vote that shocked prime minister @entity30 and raised questions about the so - called " special relationship " between @entity12 and @entity0			0
president @entity33 is lobbying members of @entity35 to back military action against @entity7 , where president @entity37 is accused of using chemical weapons on august 21			2
president @entity33 had said in the past that the use of chemical weapons would be a " red line			0
" the survey , conducted by the polling agency @entity45 for @entity1 on august 30 -- after the @entity15 vote -- found economic sanctions to be the most popular course of action in all three countries polled			1
more than half of @entity16 -- 55 % -- backed tightening economic sanctions , while 46 % of @entity15 people and 39 % of @entity14 people did			1
poll respondents were allowed to choose more than one option from a list of " most appropriate responses , " which included tightening sanctions , establishing a no - fly zone over @entity7 , striking @entity7 with missiles , invading with a ground force and doing nothing			0
more than one in five @entity16 favored doing nothing ( 22 % ) , as did more than one in four @entity14 people ( 27 % ) and nearly one in three @entity15 people ( 30 % )			1
but about half of @entity15 people said it would be appropriate for their country to engage in military intervention if the @entity71 found evidence @entity37 had used chemical weapons or if the @entity71 explicitly sanctioned the use of force			1
just under half of @entity16 people agreed , as did 35 % of @entity14 respondents			2
the poll did throw up some surprising paradoxes			0
