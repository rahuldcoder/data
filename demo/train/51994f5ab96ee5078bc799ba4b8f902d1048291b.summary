-- for a while , it seemed that the threat from @entity4 was limited to sparsely populated desert regions in the @entity6			1
through brutal tactics and persecution of minorities , the @entity8 extremist group brought slaughter and chaos to large areas of @entity15 and @entity16			0
but its merciless efforts to establish its version of an @entity20 caliphate unsettled the wider region , prompting @entity23 airstrikes aimed at stemming its advance			2
the @entity20 militant group has responded by beheading three of its @entity29 hostages in recent weeks , ratcheting up the crisis			0
it has also amped up the rhetoric , threatening attacks on the @entity23 and its allies			2
on monday , several countries quickly rejected the threats , which were made in an audio recording from an @entity4 leader who urged attacks on civilians in the @entity23 and other @entity29 nations			1
the situation underscores the question of what @entity4 hopes to gain through the intensifying conflict with the @entity23 and its allies			1
what has @entity4 been saying about the @entity23 ? @entity4 , which calls itself the " @entity47 , " has been ramping up its threats against the @entity23 and the @entity49 for months			1
the extremist group publicly warned of " direct confrontation " with the @entity23 as far back as january , according to the @entity52			2
@entity4 has also " repeatedly taunted @entity23 , " the center said , notably during the recent videotaped executions of journalists @entity55 and @entity57			1
the killings of @entity55 and @entity57 took place after the @entity23 military began airstrikes against @entity4 positions in @entity16 to help @entity64 and @entity16 forces beat back the militants ' rapid advance			1
president @entity67 has since announced his anti-isis strategy , which is expected to involve expanding the airstrikes into the chaotic @entity15 battle zone			0
the @entity23 has also been working to build up a coalition of countries to help counter the threat from @entity4 , which is also known as @entity4			1
why is @entity4 so eager to pick a fight with @entity23 ? this summer , @entity4 declared the establishment of a " caliphate , " an @entity20 state stretching across the territory it has conquered			1
a former @entity4 fighter told @entity0 this month that the group 's main aim is " to establish an @entity20 state that will encompass the @entity85 world			1
" " and after that , we go to other countries , " the man said in an interview in @entity88			0
with that goal in mind , taunting and antagonizing the world 's foremost military power may not seem like the wisest way for @entity4 leader @entity97 to expand and consolidate his territory in the @entity6			1
but analysts say that for the group to be seen around the world as locked in battle with the @entity23 is an effective means of rallying more fighters to @entity4 ' banner			1
" for @entity108 , fighting @entity23 and its coalition of 40 countries is a badge of honor , a powerful recruiting tool			1
it is proof that he and his organization have become the leaders of global jihad , toppling @entity119 , their rival in that contest , " world affairs columnist @entity112 wrote in a commentary for @entity0			0
will it work ? with the @entity23 military carrying out strikes against @entity4 forces , the extremist group is able to exploit the situation for propaganda purposes			1
the group said the executions of @entity55 and @entity57 were in response to the @entity23 airstrikes in @entity16			2
" i 'm back , @entity67 , and i 'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the @entity47 , " the executioner says in the video of @entity57 's beheading			0
" just as your missiles continue to strike our people , our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people			0
" the beheadings further intensified attention on @entity4 and its efforts to impose its heavy - handed rule on parts of @entity16 and @entity15			2
@entity23 intelligence officials estimate that more than 2,000 @entity149 and more than 100 @entity23 have flocked @entity15 to fight with extremist groups there			1
they say it 's unclear precisely how many of them have joined @entity4			1
but the strategy could backfire			0
" @entity4 is gambling that drawing @entity23 and the @entity49 into the fight will make it stronger , but if the @entity49 is strategic and smart , this move will prove to be @entity4 ' worst mistake , " said @entity112			1
what kind of threat does @entity4 pose to the @entity23 ? @entity23 officials say that @entity4 fighters are n't a direct threat to the @entity23 homeland at the moment			1
" at this point , we have no information that @entity4 is plotting an attack inside the @entity23 , " @entity165 , the director of the @entity52 , said last week in testimony to @entity167			1
the dangers , officials say , are to @entity23 personnel and infrastructure in @entity16 -- and from militants with @entity23 or other @entity29 passports potentially returning home and staging attacks			1
" what really worries @entity23 counterterrorism officials is that @entity4 will prioritize launching attacks against the @entity23 , will train @entity29 recruits in bomb - making and send them back , " said @entity0 terrorism analyst @entity179			1
the suspect in the deadly shooting at @entity188 's @entity187 in may recently spent a year in @entity15 and is a radicalized @entity189 , according to @entity191 officials			2
prosecutors say that when police arrested the @entity191 citizen , they also seized a @entity196 rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the @entity4 insignia			2
what about the risk of homegrown attacks ? that 's what security analysts say is cause for concern -- and what @entity4 appears to be urging in its new audio message			1
attacks by homegrown terrorists are n't new			0
in recent years , the @entity23 has experienced the horror of the @entity212 bombings and the @entity214 shooting			2
@entity119 has long urged individuals in the @entity49 to mount their own attacks , providing instructions on matters like bomb - making in its magazine , @entity220			0
the @entity222 marathon bombers used pressure cooker devices they apparently learned to make online			0
the @entity52 says homegrown violent extremists are " the most likely immediate threat to the homeland			0
" it estimates that the level of activity of such extremists has remained consistent over the past few years , but that @entity4 ' influence could start to play a role			2
" we remain mindful of the possibility that an @entity4 - sympathizer could conduct a limited , self - directed attack here at home with no warning , " the center says			2
officials say they are particularly concerned about @entity4 ' skillful use of propaganda , particularly on social media , to reach an audience in the @entity49			2
have there already been any cases of @entity4 - inspired attackers in the @entity49 ? @entity23 authorities have alleged that a man who owns an @entity252 food store funded @entity4 , tried to send jihadists to @entity15 and plotted to kill @entity23 troops who had served in @entity16			1
@entity255 , 30 , was arrested on may 31 , though federal officials did n't outline the case against him until last week			0
@entity255 , a naturalized @entity23 citizen from @entity258 , has pleaded not guilty to the charges , which include trying " to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization " and attempting to kill officers and employees of the @entity23			0
in @entity265 , whose government has pledged combat aircraft and military advisers to the fight against @entity4 , authorities carried out a large - scale anti-terrorism operation last week			2
@entity265 prime minister @entity272 said that an @entity265 high up in @entity4 had been calling on his networks in @entity265 to carry out " demonstration killings			0
" @entity265 media reported that the alleged assailants planned to kidnap a member of the public , behead the victim and then drape him or her in an @entity4 flag			0
authorities declined to give details about the threat , citing an ongoing operation			0
was the @entity23 slow to grasp the scale of the @entity4 menace ? while @entity4 has been taunting the @entity23 for months -- including publishing images of @entity23 soldiers engulfed in flames in its online magazine -- some critics have suggested @entity67 initially underestimated the extremist group			1
in particular , the president 's comments to @entity296 in january have been singled out			0
" the analogy we use around here sometimes , and i think is accurate , is if a @entity303 team puts on @entity305 uniforms , that does n't make them @entity306 , " @entity67 told the magazine			0
months later , @entity67 ordered airstrikes against the group , which he has described as a " cancer			0
" his defense secretary , @entity311 , said last month the threat from @entity4 was " beyond anything we have seen			0
" but senior administration officials have defended @entity67 's earlier characterization of the extremists			0
" the president was right , " deputy national security adviser @entity318 told @entity0 last month			0
" they did not pose a threat like @entity119 central to us in the homeland			0

fighting the @entity23 is " a badge of honor " that helps @entity4 recruitment , commentator says
but taking on the world 's top military power also comes with risks
@entity23 intelligence officials have said they *'re* not aware of an @entity4 plot inside the @entity23
