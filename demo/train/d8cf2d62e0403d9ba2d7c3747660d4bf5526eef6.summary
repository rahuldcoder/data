-- the online whistle - blower site @entity2 began publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from @entity5 embassies around the world sunday , spawning sharp condemnation from the @entity8 and congressional leaders			1
@entity2 , which said its servers were under electronic attacks sunday afternoon , said the documents represent the largest - ever disclosure of confidential information and give the world " an unprecedented insight into the @entity5 government 's foreign activities			1
" " the cables show the @entity5 spying on its allies and the @entity25 ; turning a blind eye to corruption and human rights abuse in ' client states ' ; backroom deals with supposedly neutral countries ; and lobbying for @entity5 corporations , " the site 's editor - in - chief and spokesman , @entity19 , said in a statement released sunday evening			1
" this document release reveals the contradictions between the @entity5 's public persona and what it says behind closed doors -- and shows that if citizens in a democracy want their governments to reflect their wishes , they should ask to see what 's going on behind the scenes			1
" but @entity8 spokesman @entity45 condemned the release , warning that publishing the documents would jeopardize " our diplomats , intelligence professionals and people around the world who come to the @entity5 for assistance in promoting democracy and open government			1
" " by releasing stolen and classified documents , @entity2 has put at risk not only the cause of human rights but also the lives and work of these individuals , " @entity45 said			1
" we condemn in the strongest terms the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents and sensitive national security information			2
" @entity5 secretary of state @entity68 reached out to leaders of eight countries over the weekend about the leaks , @entity67 spokesman @entity66 said sunday			1
those countries included @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and the @entity78 , @entity66 said			0
the @entity79 and four @entity81 newspapers that had received the documents in advance began publishing excerpts earlier sunday			2
many of them detail conversations on sensitive issues between @entity5 officials and leaders in the @entity91 , @entity77 and elsewhere			1
the major topics in the documents include : -- pressure from @entity5 allies in the @entity91 for decisive action to neutralize @entity97 's nuclear program			1
according to one cable , @entity98 of @entity99 told gen. @entity101 , then the top @entity5 commander in the region , that the @entity5 must curb @entity97 's nuclear program by whatever means necessary			1
" the danger of letting it go on is greater than the danger of stopping it , " the king is quoted as saying			0
similarly , @entity107 implored @entity108 to " cut off the head of the snake " while there was still time , according to a cable cited by the @entity75 newspaper @entity110			0
-- conversations between @entity116 president @entity115 and @entity101 about military action against @entity119 militants in @entity116			0
a cable about their january meeting reports @entity115 as saying : " we 'll continue saying the bombs are ours , not yours			0
" at that point , according to a cable sent by the then - @entity5 ambassador in @entity116 , the deputy prime minister joked " that he had just ' lied ' by telling @entity130 " that @entity116 forces had carried out the strikes			1
-- @entity108 's efforts to have highly enriched uranium removed from a @entity136 research reactor			0
in a cable sent in may 2009 , the @entity5 ambassador in @entity138 said @entity136 was refusing to schedule a visit by @entity5 technical experts			1
the ambassador said that a @entity136 official had told her : " if the local media got word of the fuel removal , ' they certainly would portray it as the @entity5 taking @entity136 's nuclear weapons			1
' " -- negotiations with governments over the transfer of prisoners held at @entity153			0
according to the @entity79 , " @entity154 was told to take a prisoner if it wanted to meet with president ( @entity158 ) @entity157 , while the island nation of @entity160 was offered incentives worth millions of dollars to take in a group of detainees			0
" -- concern that the @entity166 government was involved in global computer hacking			0
one cable cited by @entity79 said a @entity166 contact had told the @entity170 in @entity171 that the @entity172 had directed " the intrusion into @entity175 's computer system " earlier this year			0
@entity2 said the full set included 251,288 cables sent by @entity5 diplomats between the end of 1966 and february 2010			1
of those , 8,017 originated from the office of the secretary of state , and more than 15,600 are classified as secret , it said in a statement announcing the release			2
@entity2 said the documents will be released in stages " over the next few months " to allow readers to digest them			1
" the subject matter of these cables is of such importance , and the geographical spread so broad , that to do otherwise would not do this material justice , " it said			2
" we owe it to the people who entrusted us with the documents to ensure that there is time for them to be written about , commented on and discussed widely in public , something that is impossible if hundreds of thousands of documents are released at once			2
" sen. @entity200 , the chairman of the @entity201 , called the disclosure " reckless			0
" " this is not an academic exercise about freedom of information and it is not akin to the release of the @entity210 , which involved an analysis aimed at saving @entity5 lives and exposing government deception , " @entity200 , @entity203 , said in a written statement			1
" instead , these sensitive cables contain candid assessments and analysis of ongoing matters and they should remain confidential to protect the ability of the government to conduct lawful business with the private candor that 's vital to effective diplomacy , " the statement said			2
the documents posted include often - unfavorable commentaries on a variety of international leaders , as well as coverage of almost every major issue of recent years			1
the @entity5 had warned assangethat publishing the papers would be illegal and could endanger peoples ' lives			2
rep. @entity233 , the ranking @entity234 on the @entity235 , on sunday called on the @entity157 administration to prosecute @entity19			0
in a letter to attorney general @entity238 , @entity233 said @entity239 provided " material support to terrorist organizations " by releasing the documents			2
" there should be no misconception that mr. @entity19 passively operates a forum for others to exploit their misappropriation of classified information , " @entity233 wrote			0
" he actively encourages and solicits the leaking of national defense information			0
he pursues a malicious agenda , for which he remains totally immune to the consequences of his actions			0
" the site said it was already under fire sunday afternoon			0
in a statement posted on @entity258 , wikileakssaid it was experiencing a distributed denial of service ( @entity262 ) attack			2
that 's an effort to make a website unavailable to users , normally by flooding it with requests for data			0
but @entity2 posted information on the new documents sunday afternoon on a site with a different web address			1
the cables being detailed sunday follow two similar releases by @entity2 earlier this year			1
in july , the site released more than 70,000 @entity5 military reports from the war in @entity77 , and nearly 400,000 more reports about operations in @entity280 in october			2
the site indicated last week that a new batch was coming , telling followers on @entity258 that the new release would be seven times the size of the @entity280 documents			2
" intense pressure over it for months , " the group stated			0
" in addition to the @entity79 , four @entity81 newspapers -- @entity75 's @entity110 , @entity292 in @entity76 , @entity293 in @entity73 and @entity294 in @entity295 -- had prior access to @entity2 documents			1
@entity0 has not had advance access to the documents because it declined to sign a confidentiality agreement with the site			2
gen. @entity303 , the former @entity5 military spokesman in @entity280 , said the documents reveal sensitive @entity5 government positions and put diplomats at risk " for their candidness and their reporting			1
" " i think it 's important for @entity2 and its ilk to recognize the damage that they 're doing by releasing this information and be held responsible for the damage that occurs from releasing this information , " said @entity303 , who served in the @entity67 and as the @entity5 military spokesman in @entity280 during the @entity313 administration			1
but @entity321 , one of the authors of the @entity79 report , said the disclosures are most notable for their " behind - the - scenes stories -- how we speak to other countries and how they speak to us			0
" @entity321 told @entity0 the newspaper does not believe its reporting will result in drastic consequences , and that the @entity79 redacted some names and information in the cables after discussions with @entity67			0
" our judgment was that while there certainly would be repercussions , there would be strained relations perhaps with certain countries or certain leaders , we did not think that there would be lives at stake , " he said			0
" we did not think that there would be important intelligence operations that would be compromised by the material we 're actually publishes			0
the @entity67 's legal adviser , @entity348 , said saturday that his agency had had spoken with representatives from the @entity79 , the @entity110 and @entity293 about 250,000 documents that @entity2 had provided to them			1
