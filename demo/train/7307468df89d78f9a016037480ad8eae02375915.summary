-- @entity2 @entity1 are going forward with plans to sue president @entity4 and will base their legal case on the sweeping health care law he championed and they despise			1
speaker @entity8 said the suit , which also highlights an ironic @entity11 twist , will follow the argument @entity4 violated the @entity13 by circumventing @entity14 and alone delaying the law 's requirement for businesses to provide coverage			1
" in 2013 , the president changed the health care law without a vote of @entity14 , effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it , " @entity8 said in a statement			1
" that 's not the way our system of government was designed to work			0
no president should have the power to make laws on his or her own , " he added			0
the @entity1 - led @entity2 is expected to vote on a resolution authorizing legal action against the president over @entity11 at the end of the month , just before lawmakers head home for august to campaign for midterm votes			1
@entity8 then is expected to hire attorneys to actually file the suit in federal court			2
but the timing of that is unclear			0
the @entity47 plans to hold a hearing on the matter with outside legal experts			0
@entity2 calls it a ' stunt ' the @entity2 expressed disappointment in a statement , saying @entity8 and @entity1 are wasting time and taxpayer resources on a " political stunt			1
" " as the president said today , he is doing his job -- lawsuit or not -- and it 's time @entity1 in @entity14 did theirs , " the statement said			2
@entity4 defiantly challenged @entity1 last week , saying he would continue to take steps he felt were necessary with or without the support of congressional @entity1			1
" so sue me , " he dared them			0
@entity67 @entity66 also dismissed the suit as a political " stunt			2
" the case magnifies a toxic partisan climate that has engulfed @entity14 and come to define @entity4 's relations with @entity1 in general			1
some arch - conservatives in the party want him impeached			0
pushing forward @entity8 does n't agree with such a step , but he 's plowing ahead with an unusual legal challenge built around @entity1 claims @entity4 has abused his authority at the expense of the legislative process			1
@entity8 's staff has consulted experts and considered several options for the legal basis needed to make the case			2
another key area of contention was @entity4 's move in 2012 to defer deportations of children who enter the country illegally -- a hot button issue today with thousands of minors crossing the southern border unaccompanied			2
also , environmental regulations and the @entity98 prisoner exchange that freed @entity100 sgt. @entity99 were criticized			0
but a senior @entity2 @entity1 leadership aide said the health care case gives the @entity2 " the best chance of success in the courts			1
" so far , the @entity2 has passed two bills aimed at curbing executive orders			2
neither has gone anywhere in the @entity110 - controlled @entity109			0
must prove harm many legal experts have already said any lawsuit of this kind would face challenges			0
in order for it to be formally considered by the courts , @entity116 must prove that the chamber was somehow injured as an institution			0
@entity11 has been a partisan flashpoint since it 's passage in 2010 with no @entity1 support			1
the @entity2 has approved dozens of bills aiming to weaken or repeal it			2
the @entity4 administration a year ago postponed a requirement that businesses with more than 50 workers provide their employees with health insurance			2
the so - called employer mandate now wo n't take effect until 2015			1
ironically , the same lawmakers pressing the lawsuit on thursday actually voted on @entity2 legislation a year ago that would have delayed the mandate			1
but pushing that measure through the @entity110 - controlled @entity109 would have required debate , possibly other changes , and a likely delay just as the administration was gearing up to put the measure into practice			0
justifying the apparent contradiction of suing the president over taking action they actually supported initially , @entity1 aides said it is up to @entity14 to make those changes in law , not the president			1
not personal another centerpiece of the initiative required individual @entity155 to obtain health insurance from @entity11 or on the private market , or face a possible fine			0
so far 9 million people have signed up for plans under the health law , the administration has said			0
it 's the signature domestic policy achievement of @entity4 's presidency so far and a rallying cry for @entity1 , especially on the midterm campaign trail			1
earlier in the day , @entity8 argued a suit was n't simply a personal issue , but a move to defend @entity14 as an equal branch of government			2
" it 's not about republicans versus @entity110			0
this is about the legislative branch that 's being disadvantaged by the executive branch			0
and it 's not about executive actions			0
every president does executive orders , " @entity8 said			0
saying most presidents act lawfully , @entity8 said @entity4 " is basically rewriting law to make it fit his own needs			1
" read the resolution ( @entity187 ) @entity8 op - ed : why we must now sue the president opinion : dear speaker @entity8 : do your job instead @entity0 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			1

@entity1 say @entity4 changed the employer mandate on his own , violated @entity13

the @entity2 called the suit over @entity11 a " political stunt "
