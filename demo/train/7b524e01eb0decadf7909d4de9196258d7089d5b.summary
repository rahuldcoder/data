@entity0 -- @entity3 's popular @entity2 has inspired countless ingenious " hacks " since its launch at the end of 2010			1
the motion - sensing device has been modified to produce everything from real - time light sabers to nifty trash bins which catch your garbage ( however bad your aim ) , proving a catalyst for creativity and invention			0
today , @entity2 's reach extends far beyond its gaming origins , spurring advances in medical treatment			1
researchers at the @entity24 's @entity23 , for example , are using the technology to help patients recovering from a stroke			1
a specially devised algorithm enables therapists to remotely track patients ' hand and finger movements and guide them through exercises which compliment a wider program of physiotherapy			2
" it widens our opportunities to make rehabilitation more accessible to people in their homes , " says @entity36 , lecturer in @entity37 at @entity23			2
" ( @entity43 ) can just plug it into their tv and be monitored over the internet , " she said			0
" the whole tele - medicine idea opens up so many different avenues to be able to look and measure progress objectively			0
" aided by electrical engineering company @entity50 , @entity36 and colleagues have created a prototype which is currently being assessed against the traditional laboratory - based system			0
it 's an accessible technology which people are more willing to accept , says @entity36 , and @entity3 have been very supportive			1
" we 're very grateful to them for releasing the ( @entity2 for @entity60 ) @entity59 ( software development kit ) and making it more accessible to people , " she said			1
see also : @entity63 the kit has been a hit with developers with downloads in the " hundreds of thousands " since its release 18 months ago , according to @entity3			1
the company itself has been busy looking at ways to exploit the technology through its network of research laboratories around the world			0
at @entity80 's @entity24 base in @entity81 , scientists are currently trialing a new imaging tool for surgeons			1
" @entity90 in @entity91 " gives surgeons the power to manipulate scans and medical images on a computer screen using hand gestures			1
doctors at @entity93 in @entity81 and @entity0 's @entity94 have been impressed with the equipment , says @entity96 , one of the @entity80 team working on the project			0
" they 've all been extremely excited to be able to have hands - on manipulation of imaging data that they are so reliant on , particularly with the push towards minimally invasive surgery , " @entity96 said			0
watch video : hands - free browsing using @entity2 dr @entity107 , vascular surgeon at @entity108 , says @entity2 has the potential to radically change surgery			1
" with @entity2 , we could revolutionize the way we do complex operations			1
patients will spend less time in theater , and surgeons will be more in control of the information they need , " @entity114 said in a statement			0
@entity2 's influence could extend further says @entity96 , manipulating @entity123 models of the brain for neurosurgery and expanding touchless interaction into a whole suite of surgical tools			2
back in @entity23 , the same optimism persists about the progress that can be made using @entity2 for @entity60			2
@entity36 predicts that a commercially viable tool for stroke patients will be achieved within five years and that this flurry of activity is only the beginning			2
" the other work that 's going on around the world in different domains means we can all learn from each other as well , " she said			0
" it just pushes the whole field forward			0
