-- when @entity4 's relatively new ceo @entity3 decreed that workers would be required to show up at the office rather than work remotely , the immediate backlash from outsiders was mostly on the side of the angry @entity4 employees who were losing the comfort and convenience of telecommuting			1
inside the company , reactions were mixed			0
it struck a deep chord , contrary as it was to the techno - utopian impulse that has helped define @entity18 : the idea that someday soon we 'll all be working in coffee shops or at kitchen tables , with broadband connections replacing in - person interactions			1
@entity25 may have been extreme in her demands for face time at the office , but it 's the right call for a leader who is working to turn around one of the @entity34 's laggards			1
first , let 's consider what 's at stake for the company and what @entity25 is hoping to accomplish			0
@entity4 is famous for having bungled its position as a one - time internet leader			1
@entity25 was brought on specifically to revitalize the benighted company after the departure of @entity44 ; the firing of @entity46 , and the departures of another ceo who inflated his resume and an interim director			0
all the while , @entity4 has been a company in search of a direction			2
what does the end of telecommuting have to do with giving the company a sound footing ? the reasons go well beyond the obvious issue of reining in slackers who have taken advantage of @entity4 's reportedly lax monitoring of work done from home			1
talk back : is @entity4 wrong to end telecommuting ? @entity66 , @entity4 's head of human relations , has it exactly right in the memo she wrote to employees about the policy : personal interaction is still the most effective way of conveying a company 's direction , and keeping tabs on what different parts of the organization are up to			2
and that 's what @entity25 has to do with all of @entity4 's 11,500 employees to succeed			2
what do in - person meetings accomplish that e-mail ca n't ? part of the answer lies in time use surveys of ceos that go back nearly 40 years			1
management scholar @entity90 was among the first to track how top managers spend their time in the early 1970s			0
much to his surprise , he found that around 80 % of their time was spent in face - to - face meetings ; the subjects of his study had few stretches of more than 10 minutes at a time to themselves			1
more recent time use studies by researchers at @entity101 , the @entity102 and @entity103 have found that little has changed			0
despite the it revolution , business leaders still spend 80 % of their time in face - to - face meetings			1
the reason is that there 's only so much that one can glean from a written report or a spreadsheet			0
to cut through the hidden agendas , and office politics , most of the time you need to look someone in the eye and ask them , " really ? how exactly would that work ? " it is this probing and questioning that allows effective managers to gather the scraps of information needed to understand what 's really going on			1
similarly , all the way down the organizational chart , person - to - person interactions are crucial to ensure that an organization 's change of direction is n't misrepresented or garbled in its retelling			1
the bland proclamations made in reports and e-mails are given clearer meaning through the way they 're communicated in the " high fidelity " that only personal interaction will allow			0
in - person meetings can also help teams avoid misunderstandings : as one of our friends who runs a virtual workplace puts it , with e-mail exchanges alone , everyone starts to get a bit paranoid			1
finally , the @entity4 memo notes that it 's hard to innovate via e-mail exchanges or the occasional agenda - filled meeting			1
new ideas spring up through chance encounters in the cafeteria line and impromptu office meetings			0
it 's an assertion that 's backed up by academic research highlighting the importance of physical proximity in driving scientific progress			0
work at home ? share productivity tips yet there are rarely benefits without cost			0
lots of tasks are easily managed from a distance			0
a large number of the affected @entity4 employees are customer - service representatives who are n't going to be driving innovation at the company anyway			2
in one study of telecommuting at a @entity181 online travel agency , customer - service reps were both happier and more productive when working from home -- probably @entity4 service reps are n't any different from their @entity181 counterparts in this regard			1
and every @entity4 employee surely has some aspects of their jobs that could be done just as well at the kitchen table as in an office cubicle			1
but it 's hard to create a norm of " physically together " if the office is always half - empty			1
and once it becomes that way , the half that have been showing up will be less and less inclined to bother			0
finally , such a shocking and provocative directive will most certainly have the effect of imbuing the organization with the sense of urgency it needs to get the job done			0
will @entity4 employees come around to appreciating the change ? not necessarily the ones that liked to sleep in or work on a startup on @entity4 's dime , but it may be welcomed by the ones already showing up			2
will it be damaging to morale ? possibly , though it may help @entity4 employees to remember that , if they 're successful , the change is likely to be temporary			2
but the job of the ceo is n't to maximize worker happiness			0
it 's to make sure they get their jobs done			0
and in driving change at @entity4 , @entity25 thinks they need to show up at the office			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			0

@entity224 : @entity3 needs to revive @entity4 , and face time at the office is *key*
@entity229 : granted , this goes against @entity232 *vision* of everyone working from cafes
@entity229 : in - person work means innovations , avoids misunderstood directives
he says more jobs will get done and it 'll encourage those who work in a half - empty office
