-- @entity2 van der @entity1 was born to be on the water -- and after witnessing decades of incredible sailing innovations , the renowned photographer now feels like he 's an " astronaut of the sea			1
" " it 's more like space travel and i love it , " the @entity7 says of yachting 's extraordinary technological progress over the past 30 years			1
while he has n't quite had to reach for a helmet and suit , the boats which van der @entity13 now sails on are light years away from those which he used to frequent as a youngster			1
the @entity21 competition , in particular , has taken advantage of innovative materials such as carbon fiber and @entity25 , which were used on the @entity26 and the @entity27 , to create futuristic racing machines			2
" when i started racing large sailboats offshore , the sails were made of @entity31 , one click up from canvas , " van der @entity1 told @entity0			1
" the masts were built of aluminum or wood , and the hulls were built of aluminum or fiberglass			0
" today it 's all about carbon - fiber boats -- lighter , stiffer , faster -- and the spars ( used in rigging ) are taller , skinnier , stiffer and smaller sections			1
" the sails are laminated , made of carbon or @entity25 , have perfect shape , keep their shape for longer periods of time , have a wider wind range and most importantly are much lighter and easier to handle			0
" @entity50 der @entity1 made his first real foray into the world of sailing photography after taking part in the 1981 @entity55 -- an event now known as the @entity57			1
a keen sailor as a child and teenager , the sea was a second home to the @entity7 , who was brought up in @entity63 , @entity64			1
while working on commercial fishing vessels and maintaining race boats , van der @entity1 spent much of his spare time sailing -- crossing the @entity69 more than 10 times as well as racing in several other events			1
but it is that race some 33 years ago which is etched into his memory -- a relic from sailing 's past which gave little clue as what was to follow			1
" when i did the @entity55 race it was an adventure ; the same race is now a business run by professionals and sailed by well - paid professionals , " he recalls			1
" if you want to see a change in sailing , look at the @entity21			2
the boats they now sail are so extreme , very cool , but talk about light years from just 10 years ago			0
" then the top speed of the boat was about 15 miles per hour and nowadays they 're hitting 50 mph			0
" foiling 72 - foot catamarans with wing masts , space - age stuff built of all carbon , now that 's a change in what was yachting			2
it still is but it sure does n't look and feel like it			0
" after being approached to take photographs by @entity107 during the 1981 race , van der @entity1 soon discovered he possessed a talent few others could equal			1
the thrill of combining his love of sailing with his penchant for photography has taken him as far north as @entity116 in the @entity118 @entity117 and as far south as @entity119			1
now living in @entity120 , @entity121 with his wife and three children , van der @entity13 has continued to produce some of the most beautiful images that the sailing world has seen			1
his new book " sailing , " which includes nearly 200 color photographs and five gatefolds of panoramic images , showcases work from across the globe			2
" i 'm so lucky to do a job i love , " he says			0
" i 've had some wonderful experiences			0
" there are times where you are barely afloat and have the gales blowing			0
there have been some scary moments , but to get the pictures you have to go through all of that			2
" if you stay at home you wo n't get those photos			0
" the advances in technology have not only helped the experienced professionals -- the amateur photographer is now better equipped than ever			0
smartphone cameras and dslrs make taking photos easier than ever , and van der @entity1 believes these developments can only be good for photography in the long run			1
" we 've come a hell of a long way since film , " he adds			0
" the change has been radical and has not only dramatically changed photography for the professionals but brought it to the masses as well			0
" everybody now shoots be it with smartphone or a dslr			0
the pictures are better , sharper , better color , no grain , super sensitive in low light -- you can shoot by candle light if needed			2
" you can blow up the images to the size of a billboard and to top it all off it 's so much easier to do			2
" the tools we have today make for much better photography for everyone , and i love it			0
