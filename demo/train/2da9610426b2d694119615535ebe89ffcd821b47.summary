-- after facing a long list of charges including sexual assault , @entity4			1
gen. @entity5 agreed to plead guilty this week to much lesser charges in a case involving sexual misconduct in the military -- one in which politics may have gotten in the way of justice			1
on display was a military legal system , apparently eager to show it was getting tough on sexual misconduct cases , that instead bungled the case			1
on thursday , @entity5 was sentenced			2
he received a reprimand and has to forfeit some pay			0
but he got no jail time			0
his sentence is a mockery of military justice , a slap on the wrist nowhere close to being proportional to his offenses			1
but the @entity5 case is not typical of most military sexual assault cases			1
@entity5 had a three - year relationship and allegedly forced sex with a female captain under his command			2
the prosecution was problematic partly because the accuser may have told lies and partly because senior military officers may have brought harsher than usual charges			0
we do n't want commanders feeling that they need to appear tough on sexual assault by bringing charges that are n't warranted -- just as we do n't want them sweeping them under the rug			1
this is another example of what happens when a system is reliant on people who are not legal experts , rather than on trained independent prosecutors			1
despite the problems with this particular case , we need to confront the bigger issue with the military prosecution system in cases of sexual assault and misconduct			1
there are an estimated 26,000 sexual assaults a year in the military -- but reporting is low , courts - martial are rare and the conviction rate is less than 1 %			2
the vast majority of sexual assault and rape cases in the military show a pattern of suppression , where if a report is made the victim fears retaliation and the loss of his or her job			1
for example , the scandal at @entity79 has seen 33 basic training instructors investigated for misconduct allegations involving 63 recruits and trainees , none of whom reported they were sexually assaulted			0
survivors do n't report because they fear they wo n't get justice and that their attackers will go unpunished			0
federal law for the military -- the @entity92 -- was created with the intent of preventing arbitrary punishments by generals and colonels			0
but leaving sexual assault and rape cases in the hands of commanders to prosecute creates a fundamental conflict of interest that undermines service members ' due process rights			1
until the decision to prosecute is taken away from commanding officers , the military justice system is simply not credible			1
for more than three years now i have taken to the @entity110 floor and told the stories of the men and women in our armed forces who have been sexually assaulted			0
many of these stories involved commanders who undermined investigations , refused to bring a case to court - martial , or overturned a case after a jury had found the perpetrator guilty and a jail sentence was issued			2
some opponents of reform continue to claim that commanders must be the sole decision - makers on whether a case moves forward to trial			2
keep in mind the countless stories in the press of legitimate cases not making it to trial or sentences being lessened or thrown out completely -- all at the whim of the commander			0
of course there is also the fact that the entire military structure rests on the shoulders of individuals with no legal training			1
commanders are the linchpin of the military justice system			1
just last month , a deluge of sex crime reports in @entity153 involving @entity155 military personnel were revealed thanks to multiple @entity158 requests made by @entity159			0
the data reveal how broken the military scales of justice truly are , and offer a rare glimpse into how reports of sexual assaults are handled			2
of the 1,000 reports , punishments were wildly inconsistent , and of the suspects determined to be guilty , nearly two - thirds spent no time in jail at all			0
in more than 30 cases , a letter of reprimand was the only punishment			0
what is clear from these cases is that commanders were part of the problem , not the solution			2
commanders often decided to not move forward with courts - martial , but when they did -- even with dna evidence and tape - recorded confessions of rape -- the predators were typically given mild punishments after pleading to lesser charges			2
commanders also lessened numerous punishments unilaterally and in two cases threw out guilty verdicts and punishments completely			0
my bipartisan legislation , the @entity196 , will take sexual assault and rape cases out of the chain of command and put them into the hands of civilian and military legal experts			1
this is a system that some are hellbent on protecting			0
but i intend to fight this year with every fiber of my being to get the @entity110 to act on fixing this broken system			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			0

@entity210 : the military legal system bungled the case of gen. @entity5
@entity210 : legal experts , not commanders , should decide on sexual assault cases
she says most military sexual assault and rape cases show pattern of suppression
@entity210 : military justice rests on the shoulders of individuals with no legal training
