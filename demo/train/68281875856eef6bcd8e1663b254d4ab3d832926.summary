@entity0 , @entity1 -- my latest film , " @entity5 " is about to hit the screens			1
in it , i play quite literally one of @entity1 's strongest women -- the only woman boxer to have won a medal in each one of the six world championships			1
her 's is an inspiring story of a young woman who fought odds that were heavily stacked against her to achieve her dreams			1
she came from a small town but never let the lack of opportunities or any form of discrimination stop her			2
with her story still ringing in my head , i set off to a small village near @entity0 in @entity1 's @entity24 on @entity25 at the behest of @entity27 to visit a new generation of strong young @entity1 women with some very inspiring stories			1
the girls i met are part of the @entity34 program , or @entity35 as it is locally known , run in partnership with @entity27 , @entity37 and the @entity38			1
the program is determined to challenge the difficulties many girls face across @entity1 , providing them with the knowledge and skills required to become strong financially independent women and also very importantly , to become the agents for change and development in their communities			1
bursting with potential in my eight years as a @entity27 ambassador championing the cause of adolescent girls , i am so proud of the work we 've been able to do together			1
i passionately believe that young people are bursting with potential , that they can transform society			1
we need to urgently invest in their future and help them realize their potential and i am determined to help make that happen			0
consider the numbers and you will see why this is such a critical requirement : there are approximately 1.2 billion adolescents in the world today , according to the @entity70 , of which 243 million of them are in @entity1			1
i remember the dreams i had when i was a teenager			0
with support , opportunities and a lot of hard work i 've been able to make them happen			0
but i know that many youngsters are n't so lucky			0
in @entity24 , like many other states in @entity1 , girls are held back by not completing education , early marriage , ignorance around health issues , and lacking financial understanding and a voice for decision making			1
we owe them a better life , which in itself will have a positive impact on our nation and society as a whole			0
if we can educate more girls , provide them with employment opportunities and give them the right life skills , their world will open up ! girls transformed as i sat in a circle with a group of girls playing a team game about working together and sharing responsibilities , delegating and planning , i could see the true impact of this program			1
games like these , alongside @entity37 volunteers sharing their financial knowledge , are what help the girls plan , set up and develop their own enterprises			1
at the end of the session , the girls came together to sing an anthem created especially for them about how " they are taking charge			1
" i had goose pimples just listening to the power and determination in their voices			0
they had overcome so many hardships and yet they were ready to take on new challenges and improve the quality of life for themselves and everyone around them			0
i was invited to their marketplace to see the businesses some of the girls have set up with their new found business and saving skills -- making bags , saris and sanitary napkins -- each a story of a girl transformed , taking charge of her life and starting something of larger social relevance			2
it was a shopping trip with a difference			0
so what are the ingredients for a strong girl ? how can we make sure that " all girls and boys can make their own name and fate and be independent , " as one girl told me			2
here 's my list : teach a young adult not what to think but how to think encourage young people to dare to believe , to realize dreams @entity165 a young girls confidence to voice her own opinions and solve her own problems instill an understanding of saving , money and business to become financially independent nurture an interest in their community so their impacts can be shared alongside all this , add a bit of magic , encouraging the girls to share their new power and use it to do good for the community			1
these girls go out and teach other girls and the ripple of empowerment spreads			2
it 's a real , tangible , positive effect where is there for all to see			0
walking along a path in this quiet village in the middle of nowhere , it is easy to see how a girl can get lost -- lost for life			0
i was there to meet @entity198 , 23 , who had invited me into her home			0
she was far from lost			0
one of five sisters , her parents had initially been indifferent and felt burdened by them			0
the girls were not expected to have a future			2
her father was paralyzed and was not able to take care of the family and that 's where his young daughter stepped in			2
today @entity209 provides for her parents and her family by saving and building a tailoring business herself , as well as doing much good in her village			0
as i was leaving , her father told me she had become the son he never had			0
i replied that he did n't need a son , he already had his daughters ! @entity198 told me she learned that she " can not do anything sitting at home , " that she must " come out and take charge of my own destiny			0
" i thought that was a great message for young people everywhere on @entity25			1
with programs like @entity34 , these positive stories and messages will only grow in number .			2
