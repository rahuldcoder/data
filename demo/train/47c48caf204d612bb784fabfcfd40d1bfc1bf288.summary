the famous individual mandate is just one piece of the new health care law enacted in 2010			1
take away the mandate , and here are two principal elements left behind : -- a huge expansion of the @entity16 program			1
the majority of those who 'd gain health coverage under the new health care law , an estimated 18 million people , would gain it from being enrolled in @entity16 , the health care program for the poor			1
even before the new health care law , @entity16 was a huge program , covering one in six @entity27			1
it 's on its way to becoming bigger still , whatever happens to the individual mandate			2
-- tough new rules on insurance companies			0
the new health care law forbids insurers to refuse coverage on the basis of " pre-existing conditions			1
" all applicants must be accepted , and they must be covered at the same price as the other members of the insured group			0
now let 's war - game what happens post-mandate			2
the private insurance market will crash in a spectacular train wreck			1
faced with big new costs and deprived of their expected new revenues from the mandate , insurance companies will have to raise prices			0
faced with rising prices , employers will cut back coverage			0
the 2010 law imposes new obligations on employers to provide health insurance but also presents employers with an option to escape those obligations by paying a ( comparatively ) small fine			1
as insurance costs surge in a post-mandate world , more employers will take advantage of that option			0
their employees will join the new market for individual care , the famous health care " exchanges			1
" minus the mandate , the policies on offer in the exchanges will be unexpectedly expensive			0
minus the mandate , many individuals will choose not to buy			0
the law offers subsidies to buyers who can not afford the full cost of the new policies			0
minus the mandate , those subsidies will cost much more than expected			0
the @entity16 program will grow			0
the new health care law dramatically expands eligibility for @entity16			1
in a post-mandate world , with employers dropping coverage and the individual market careening into dysfunction , @entity16 will likely grow faster than ever			2
costs of the @entity16 program are divided between the federal and state governments			0
as @entity16 surges , those governments will face an agonizing dilemma : raise taxes to pay for all those new applicants or reduce coverage , leaving millions of people to clinics and charity			2
meanwhile , the @entity102 time bomb will continue to tick			0
the @entity27 already has a single - payer health care system			1
it 's called @entity102 , and even today , it is one of the largest single - payer systems on @entity108 , enrolling more than 47 million people			2
as more and more of the baby boomers turn 65 , the program is scheduled to expand rapidly -- to more than 63 million people by 2020 and more than 80 million by 2030			0
we are headed , it would seem , to a post-mandate future that looks something like this : @entity102 will provide fairly generous government health coverage to about one - quarter of the population			2
@entity16 will provide much less generous government coverage to one - quarter of the population			1
the population outside @entity16 and @entity102 will subdivide into two main groups : the affluent and those whose labor is greatly valuable to their employers will be covered by an ever - more - expensive and ever - shrinking private - insurance market			1
the people who ca n't pay themselves and whose employers wo n't pay for them will drop out of the private market , and either look for ways to qualify for @entity16 or wait and pray until they qualify for @entity102			1
political pressures will induce politicians to open @entity16 to more and more uninsured people			2
fiscal pressures will force politicians to make @entity102 less generous and more @entity16 - like			2
if the @entity1 rules unconstitutional the plan for universal coverage through private insurance , the @entity27 will continue to evolve toward a government - led system -- albeit one much more expensive , and much less satisfactory , than the government systems of other advanced democracies			1
perhaps after a decade or two of discontent , somebody else will try another reform			0
but this time , the reform will proceed as an outright government program			0
there wo n't be any choice , if the @entity1 of 2012 precludes as unconstitutional the private - sector alternative -- meaning that today 's would - be champions of the free market will have unwittingly brought about the grandest expansion of government control since the 1930s			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			0

the @entity27 @entity1 may strike down the mandate to buy health insurance
@entity161 says *elimination* of mandate would spur more government - funded health care
without private insurance , more people will look to get @entity16 coverage , he says
@entity176 : the court 's free - market boosters could spark huge government expansion
