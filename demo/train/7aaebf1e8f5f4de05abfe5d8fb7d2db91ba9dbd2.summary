that was the humble fundraising goal @entity1 set on july 8 , lowering his expectations for the second @entity4 campaign for his @entity6 creation , a high - tech cooler jam - packed with all sorts of fun gizmos -- from a built - in ice crushing blender to @entity10 speakers and a usb charger			1
see , the first time @entity1 took to the crowdfunding site -- back in november 2013 -- his goal was far more ambitious : $ 125,000			1
yet , after an encouraging strong start , interest in the campaign began wavering			1
by closing , the project managed to raise a little over $ 100,000 in pledges and eventually failed to hit its mark			1
the failure dealt a blow to @entity1 's confidence -- but the entrepreneur , who describes himself as " part visionary , part mad scientist " refused to give up			1
taking the lessons he 'd learned from the failed campaign , @entity1 re-grouped and last month re-introduced an advanced version of his creation			1
the result ? just over a month later : more than $ 8.2 million in pledges and some 41,000 backers			1
with 21 days still to go , @entity1 's project has become the third most - funded campaign on @entity4 ever -- and could very well hit the top spot if pledges continue to pile in			1
so , what was the secret behind @entity1 's astonishing comeback ? and what are the best tips that could help turn your business idea into a crowdfunding mega-success ? to find out , @entity50 's @entity49 spoke to grepper himself and @entity52 from @entity4 , as well as crowdfunding experts @entity53 and @entity55 about their top tips for being a @entity4 success			1
@entity1 , @entity6 creator make sure the design is visually compelling			1
my first @entity4 campaign failed and i believe one of the biggest reasons was that i had not advanced the design far enough to capture the @entity4 audience			1
@entity4 is a very visual platform			1
when i took my design further along in the process i was better able to share my love of the @entity6 and more people naturally connected			1
consider the time of year when customers will be most receptive			2
i originally launched the @entity6 in november			1
at the time i was thinking we might hit the @entity74 shopping and tailgating audience , but what quickly became apparent was that folks were not focused on coolers in november			1
relaunching in july was perfect because people are thinking about coolers during the summer and it was much easier to get exposure			0
this sounds obvious now , but i believe in learning from my mistakes			0
develop a following before the campaign			1
although my first campaign failed , i saw that some people were very interested in the @entity6			1
we nurtured that interest in between our first and second campaign and worked hard to grow that excitement			2
by the time we launched our second campaign we had a terrific core of interested backers			2
now i ca n't believe how our group of backers has grown			0
@entity52 , @entity4 spokesperson make a video ! projects with videos have a higher success rate than those without			1
your video does n't have to be super pro looking			0
some of our favorite project videos have a very @entity108 feel			0
offer great rewards ! some rewards are straightforward , like a copy of the album you made			0
other rewards are more creative and unique			0
the best projects tend to have a mix of both -- it 's important to have great rewards at at all pledge levels			2
the most popular pledge amount on @entity4 is $ 25 , and the site - wide average for all pledges is about $ 70			1
updates are a great way to build a relationship with your backer community			0
while your project is live , keep your backers informed about new developments and funding milestones			0
it 'll inspire them to help you spread the word			0
treat your project like a story that 's unfolding before their eyes			2
detailed updates like " pics from last night 's show ! " or " we found a printer for our book ! " are fun for everybody to follow along with			2
@entity53 , founder of @entity143 start building an email and social media audience immediately , with the promise of content that interests them for following you			1
growing an audience takes time , but you can do it while you plan everything else			2
even your journey to prepare can be interesting to the right people			0
the first 48 hours of your campaign is the most critical			2
if you can get your followers to visit and pledge at any time , make it right at the start			0

each group provides social proof to the next group , by showing other people have already backed you when they arrive			2
@entity55 , founder of @entity172 do n't re-invent the wheel			0
study the creators that have come before you			0
how did they structure their @entity4 page ? what rewards did they offer ? how many updates did they do throughout the campaign ? in addition , by backing several popular projects in your category , you can see how other creators do backer communication and how long it takes them to fulfil their promises			1
also , by browsing their list of backers , you can get an idea of whether the supporters are part of the @entity196 ( backed multiple projects ) or are first - time supporters , meaning the project drove a lot of its own traffic			0
focus on emotion , but back it up with technical ability			0
it 's no secret that part of what makes crowdfunding campaigns spread quickly and gather a supporter base is social media			1
whether it 's networks like @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , and @entity216 , or social bookmarking websites like @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , and @entity222 , information can disseminate in a matter of hours and light up the web 2.0 news networks			1
what many people overlook is the reason why information spreads : it spreads when it makes a reader feel a certain way , which then makes them want to share that link			0
the feeling that prompts a backer to share that link could be " this is so cool ! " or " this is an important cause			0
" it 's easiest to invoke a feeling when you have a prior relationship with your backers , as is the case with the multi-million dollar " @entity248 " campaign			1
although ultimately , you want your backers to come away from your video and campaign feeling something , you must also back up your pitch with technical ability			2
what prototype have you created ? why can your team deliver on their promises ? you must engage both the left and right hemisphere of the brain when crowdfunding			0
typically , when we think of a salesman , we think of a slimy quick - talking city slicker with too - white teeth and a $ 2,000 suit			2
these types of individuals are an instant turnoff			0
the best types of salesmen do n't make you feel like you are being " sold to			0
" they have the ability to create the urge to buy			0
usually this is the result of giving people what they want , or connecting problems people experience with an appropriate solution			0
since you are going to be doing a lot of self - promoting , it 's important that you adopt the mental mindset of your potential backers			2
what types of rewards would get them excited ? how would they want to be pitched ? what would turn them off ? read this : how to start your own currency read this : would you bank with @entity292 ?			0
