-- i do n't know if it 's sexism or wisdom or just plain fear , but men have been socialized to avoid saying two words in the presence of women			1
the first is " fat			0
" i know i do n't go there			1
and i do n't see a good reason why any man should			1
when women use the word around me i pretend not to hear it , and if asked a question with the word " fat " in it , i sneeze in my hand and then ask for a tissue			1
@entity20 , yes , but it allows me to change the subject without having to answer the question			0
and i do n't ever want to answer that question			1
speaking of questions , the second word we should all stay away from is " weave			1
" i do n't care if a man sees a woman bald at the office on wednesday , with blond finger waves at the club on friday , and with jet black hair down to her butt at church on sunday -- if anyone asks if she wears a weave , the answer is " i do n't know			1
" she could be holding a receipt from @entity42 in one hand , and five pounds of hair in the other , and he should say " i 'm not sure			0
" at the salon where i get my dreadlocks retwisted , every third woman walks in with a bag of hair			0
i keep my head down , eyes closed and try not to breathe			0
i want to be as invisible as possible , because the last thing i want is for a woman in there to think i 'm aware of her lace - front , glued - in , braided back or whatever it is she 's got going on up there			1
and every man i know harbors that same level of sexism / wisdom / fear			0
which is why i had to talk to @entity66 , who was not only brave and / or stupid enough to bring up his co-worker 's weave -- he did it right in front of her face			1
@entity66 and @entity74 host the morning show for @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78			1
during the @entity80 broadcast , @entity66 blew out the candle inside the jack - o ' - lantern sitting on the desk			0
@entity84 joked that if the smoke from the candle set off the studio sprinkler system , " i 'm done for the day			0
" " sitting up here looking like a mop , " she said			0
that 's when my main man @entity66 chimed in , " you do not want a sprinkler system and a beautiful weave , because they do not go together			1
" right now you 're probably thinking : oh no he did n't			1
and i 'm here to tell you : oh yes he did			0
and even as @entity84 stared at him with her mouth hanging open and a high - pitched wail filling the room , poor @entity66 went on to say " you said it was a weave -- right ? " i had n't laughed that hard at a @entity106 clip since @entity107 told us to hide our kids			1
and sites such as @entity111 and @entity112 had a field day			0
" i knew the first rule about not talking about fat , but i did n't know the second , " he said			1
" no one told me about the second			0
" which is why i had to write this column , in an effort to save lives this holiday season			0
men , i do n't care if half of her track is dangling in a pot of black - eyed peas , you do not acknowledge that weave			1
you sneeze in your hand and go to the bathroom and pray that an aunt , a cousin , someone has told her by the time you get out			0
now , @entity84 and @entity66 are great friends , and their rapport plays well on camera -- even while " weave-gate " was unfolding			1
the two even put out a follow - up to try to add more context to the story			0
@entity66 , who is bald , said the two actually talk about weaves on the show quite a bit , something he attributes to his latent hair envy			0
@entity84 said the fact that she wears a weave is not a secret at the studio			1
she actually has long hair that is n't permed , but she chooses to wear a weave because daily exposure to the heat from the studio lights can damage hair			1
but @entity84 said while she was comfortable with @entity66 and others knowing , she was shocked " he put all of my business out there like that			0
" " i was n't mad at him -- but he clearly did n't know the rule , " she said , laughing			1
" no , i did n't run to @entity168 , i did n't beat him up off set			2
no , i did n't have to explain my blackness to him afterwards			2
it was clear he was trying to make a compliment			0
... he did n't mean to call me out			2
" but that did n't stop some people from drawing a different , less forgiving conclusion			2
" i was a little surprised by some of the pretty harsh things people said about me , " @entity66 said			0
" i do n't believe i 'm a racist or a white devil or a bitchy queen as some people have posted about me			2
i just was n't thinking			2
" but it 's funny , we can talk about fake eyelashes , lip gloss , makeup and all of the other enhancements that we do , but when it comes to hair , we keep quiet			2
it 's the last taboo			2
" that 's when i stepped in and reminded @entity66 that while " weave-gate " was bad , hair is not the last taboo			2
and if he did n't believe me , he should try bringing up the word " fat " and see what happens			2
of course , i wo n't do it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 says there are a couple of words men should avoid when talking with women
the words : " @entity214 " and " weave . " but a tv host mentioned his *female* **co-host** 's weave on air
@entity206 says the male **co-host** said he did n't know the rule
@entity206 : men , you can mention almost anything else -- but not the weave
