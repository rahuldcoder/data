@entity0 -- by refusing @entity4 's offer of a " @entity5 " shifted to a post-midnight , @entity7 time slot , host @entity2 has protected the 56 - year - old tradition of that program			1
and he 's also protected the 46 - year - old @entity2			2
rejecting @entity4 's recent offer was the best move @entity2 could have made -- even if he was forced into it			1
had he stayed where he was , he would most likely would have continued to lose in the ratings			0
had he accepted a move to an even later time slot , his losses would likely increase			0
@entity2 laid down his hand tuesday afternoon and showed his hole cards , in an aggressively pointed way			0
he delivered a self - penned missive and handed it to @entity24 of the @entity25 , a long - time respected chronicler of the late - night wars			2
in it , he talked of protecting the legacy of " @entity5 , " a concern that his @entity4 bosses clearly do not share			2
@entity2 's respect for late - night television and its traditions may be more elusive and less common in the future			1
like the evening news , late - night tv still attracts millions of viewers , but its stature is far from what it was			0
when late - night tv reaches water - cooler - conversation status these days , it 's via the @entity44 , not same - night viewing			0
what do you think about @entity4 's late - night conundrum ? @entity4 , which announced years ago it would hand the reins of " @entity5 " from @entity7 to @entity2 , was hoping for an orderly transition			1
it wanted to avoid , at all costs , the public and uncomfortable turf war that had @entity54 and @entity7 vying for @entity56 's throne as it was being vacated in 1992			0
yet by trying to have its cake and eat it too -- giving @entity7 a prime - time platform each weeknight in " the @entity62 , " which premiered in september -- @entity4 had months ago set in motion a series of disastrous decisions that makes the @entity67 skirmish seem like a bear hug			1
even before @entity7 's new series premiered , @entity2 had failed , in one measure , as host of " @entity5			1
" the long - established ratings lead , which @entity7 had enjoyed since shortly after @entity54 jumped ship to @entity74 , vanished			0
and once @entity7 hit prime time and began hemorrhaging viewers , things only got worse -- for prime time , for the @entity4 affiliates and their weakened late - news operations and for @entity2 himself			1
the only good decision @entity4 has made in this entire process has been to reverse its own decision to put @entity7 on weeknights in prime time in the first place			2
there , @entity7 delivered a program that seemed as cheap as the price tag , and viewers , after sampling a few editions , abandoned it by the millions			0
but even then , the network most likely would not have pulled him from that spot unless the affiliates had threatened an outright mutiny			0
( to @entity4 , the program was much less expensive to produce than a clump of one - hour dramas			0
) yet @entity4 , rather than admit to a bad idea or two , made a third , by promising @entity7 a return to late - night at 11:35 p.m. in exchange for canceling the prime - time " @entity62			1
" this meant either " @entity5 , " under @entity2 , would be relegated to a 12:05 a.m. start or @entity2 would quit , opening the way for @entity7 to regain not just his old time slot , but his old job			1
@entity2 has pushed it back in @entity4 's face , saying he wo n't accept the move to post-midnight			1
freed from @entity4 , @entity2 would be able to reinvent himself , take his time , call his next shot			2
so unless @entity4 repeals its offer to @entity7 , that 's it			2
" @entity5 with @entity110 " will rise again			0
but will the ratings ? with @entity7 a prime - time loser , and a " @entity5 " usurper , that 's the latest , biggest question			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity118 .			0

@entity118 says @entity2 protected himself by shunning @entity4 time shift
he says bad @entity4 decisions , @entity2 's own poor ratings led him to fail at hosting *gig*
dropping @entity110 's prime - time show was network 's one smart call , he says
@entity118 : @entity2 has forced @entity4 's hand : repeal offer or return @entity7 to " @entity5 "
