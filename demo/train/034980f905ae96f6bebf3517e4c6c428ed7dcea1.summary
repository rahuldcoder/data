@entity0 -- three @entity2 were wounded monday in two separate incidents , including one that @entity6 officials described as a " price tag " attack against @entity2			1
" price tag " attacks are actions taken by @entity6 settlers against @entity2 and @entity2 properties as retaliatory measures			1
in the first incident , according to @entity17 , head of the @entity18 of @entity19 who said he was an eyewitness , a settler opened fire on a @entity2 funeral procession that was taking place in the village , wounding two palestinians			1
the two were identified as a man , 32 , who was shot in the right leg , and a 59 - year - old man shot in the chest			0
according to @entity17 , " an @entity6 settler got out of his car , approached the cemetery gates , pulled his pistol and fired towards the funeral procession , injuring two @entity2 people			1
" @entity17 said the settler then ran for cover to a nearby @entity6 military watch tower but was not arrested by the military			1
" the @entity6 soldiers did not arrest the @entity6 settler and gave him a safe haven			1
later the soldiers started firing tens of tear gas canisters towards the people who were taking part in the funeral procession without any reason , just to protect the settler , " he said			1
the @entity6 military denied that its soldiers were standing idly by and said they only began employing tear gas after @entity2 started throwing rocks at their positions			2
dr. @entity53 of @entity54 in @entity55 said the staff there treated the two @entity2 with gunshot wounds			0
@entity6 @entity60 spokesman @entity59 told @entity1 that police received reports of the shootings and were investigating the incident , adding that they had also received complaints about @entity2 throwing rocks in the area			1
in the second incident , a 32 - year - old @entity2 farmer was stabbed in the upper body by masked @entity6 settlers in the southern @entity55 hills , according to @entity2 medical officials			1
they said the man , @entity75 from the village of @entity77 near the settlement @entity79 , was stabbed in the shoulder and chest and remains in moderate condition			0

@entity59 said " the police believe this is a ' price tag ' incident " and that officers were on the scene searching for the suspect			1
in a statement , the @entity98 held the @entity6 government responsible for both attacks for what it described as " tolerating settlers ' violence against @entity2			2
" " the @entity2 government media center holds the @entity6 government responsible for tolerating settler violence against @entity2 , " the statement read			1
" only last week , six @entity2 workers were attacked brutally by settlers near @entity112 settlement			0
this action was part of the ' price tag ' policy of settlers that has been escalating , while the @entity6 government remains tolerant and provides immunity for settlers committing crimes against @entity2			1
@entity2 ' safety and security is an immediate demand and need			0
" @entity55 governor @entity127 told @entity1 the incidents were not isolated , represent escalating attacks by @entity6 settlers and said the @entity6 government is not doing enough to put an end to them			2
" it is clear that there is a continuous escalation in the daily attacks by the settlers on the @entity2 and is supported by the @entity6 army because they do not interfere to stop these attacks and does not arrest any of the attackers and do not bring them to justice , " @entity127 said			0
" the @entity6 government looks like it is interested in escalating the situation and not interested in calming the situation			0
it is not interested in putting an end to these settlers ' violations and acts of terror			0
" monday 's attacks come a week after five members of an @entity6 family living in the northern @entity154 settlement of @entity155 were killed by an unknown assailant in what the @entity6 military called a terror attack			2
commenting on that attack , @entity6 prime minister @entity160 demanded that the @entity98 assist in finding those responsible but he did not explicitly blame @entity2 for the deaths			2
an investigation is still ongoing			0
@entity98 president @entity165 condemned the attack			0
in an address to the @entity168 of the @entity169 last week , @entity165 said , " we have condemned this crime ... it is not humanitarian and ( an ) unethical act ... but there was an insistence in directing the blame to the @entity2 people , before the investigation details and final report of who committed the crime were released			0
" @entity1 's @entity182 contributed to this report			0
