" the @entity5 conflict continues to have a devastating impact on the lives of those who are forced to flee , " said @entity8 , a spokesman for the office of the @entity2 high commissioner for refugees , in @entity11 , @entity12			1
" refugees tell us the increased fighting and changing of control of towns and villages , in particular in conflict areas , results in more and more civilians deciding to leave			0
over the past four months , we have seen a rapid deterioration when compared to the previous 20 months of this conflict , " he said			0

along with the refugees , more than 4 million people have been internally displaced , according to @entity39 president @entity38			1

the aim would be to implement last summer 's @entity11 communique brokered by @entity61 and the @entity59 outlining how a transitional government could be formed			1
@entity62 and @entity121 said this month that they had agreed to try to organize a meeting " as soon as is practicable , possibly and hopefully , by the end of this month			0
" @entity134 : @entity135 should n't be part of @entity5 conference even though it 's viewed as a civil war , the conflict in @entity5 has had a significant impact on its region			2
violence has spilled over into @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
and the conflict has become entangled in issues involving another hot - button nation in the @entity149 : @entity135			0
on friday , @entity134 's foreign ministry issued a statement opposing @entity135 's participation in an international peace conference on @entity5			0
@entity135 has been a strong ally of @entity87 and his government , as well as a focus of international condemnation over its nuclear program			0
" the stability of the whole region is in question , " the @entity134 ministry said			0
" we ca n't see a country , representing a threat to stability , taking part in this conference			0

a new video purported to be of the @entity5 rebel who carried out the atrocity , @entity206 , known as @entity207 , was also posted online friday			2
he is asked , " @entity207 , do you regret what you have done ? after the killing of the @entity87 militiaman and the mutilation of his body ? " he replies : " i am ready to face justice and be brought to trial for my actions on the condition that they need to bring @entity87 and his thugs to stand trial as well , for the atrocities that they have committed against our women and children			0
" he warns that " if the bloodshed does n't stop in @entity5 , all of the @entity5 people will be @entity207			0
" although @entity0 can not independently verify the authenticity of the videos , it interviewed a local rebel spokesman this week who confirmed the heart - eating incident and said he had spoken to the man involved			0

" those in control of @entity262 need to safeguard the materials in these facilities so the truth can be told and those responsible held accountable			0
