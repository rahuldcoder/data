-- in choosing a new @entity3 director to replace @entity4 , president @entity1 has a range of well - qualified candidates to choose from , although some of the most qualified were in management roles at the @entity3 when controversial interrogation techniques were used by agency interrogators questioning @entity12 prisoners and the @entity3 was maintaining secret prisons overseas to detain members of @entity12			1
@entity15 , a three - decade veteran of the @entity3 , is now the acting director of the agency and a leading contender to become the next director of central intelligence			1
as a candidate for the permanent job , @entity15 has all the advantages and disadvantages of someone who has been instrumental in recent successes at the @entity3 such as tracking down @entity25			1
but he was also was in a managerial position at the @entity3 in the @entity27 years when the agency waterboarded three detainees and also imprisoned a larger number in the secret prisons overseas where they were subjected to other coercive interrogation techniques			1
any confirmation hearing for @entity15 would run the risk of a public discussion of the efficacy and ethics of such controversial practices			2
and there would also be the risk that such a hearing might open up the @entity41 of the @entity3 's many failures that led to the fiasco of the deeply flawed assessment that @entity45 was building up his weapons of mass destruction program in the run - up to the @entity49 in 2003			2
@entity4 probe includes top general in @entity52 there is also the current controversy about why the intelligence committees in @entity56 were informed only on friday about the @entity58 investigation into @entity4			2
@entity15 and the @entity58 's deputy director , @entity59 , are scheduled to meet with members of the intelligence committees wednesday to discuss the matter			1
in contrast to @entity15 , other potential candidates for the director 's job at @entity3 , such as former @entity67 rep. @entity66 or @entity68 , the top intelligence official at the @entity70 , were not working at the @entity3 when coercive measures were used on @entity12 detainees			1
on the other hand , few have played such a key role in some of the most dramatic moments in the war against @entity12 as @entity15 has			1
from the day that @entity27 took office on january 20 , 2001 , every morning , six days a week , @entity79 was the @entity3 official who briefed the president about what the intelligence community believed to be the most pressing national security issues			2
on august 6 , 2001 , eight months after @entity27 was inaugurated , @entity15 met with the president at his vacation home in @entity87 to deliver the president 's daily brief			2
the top - secret briefing that @entity15 delivered was titled " @entity25 determined to strike in @entity67 " a month later , on the morning of september 11 , 2001 , in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity15 gave the daily briefing as usual to the president			1
there was nothing memorable in it			0
who 's who in the @entity4 scandal then @entity15 got into the president 's motorcade to head to the local elementary school where @entity27 planned to meet with some students			1
at the school , where @entity27 was reading a story to a group of second - graders , the news came on tv that a second jet had hit the @entity111			0
@entity27 and a small group of other officials including @entity15 were hustled out of the school to head to @entity115 , which took off for @entity116 near @entity117 , @entity118			2
in @entity120 , news soon circulated that a @entity123 terrorist organization , the @entity121 , had claimed responsibility for the attacks			0
@entity27 summoned @entity15 , asking , " what do you make of this ? " @entity79 replied , " the @entity121 has a history of terrorism against @entity131 , but its capabilities are limited			2
it does not have the resources and reach to do this			0
" in the early afternoon , @entity115 headed from @entity118 to @entity136 near @entity137 , @entity138			0
@entity27 asked to see @entity15 again , and pushed him for his opinion about who was behind the attacks			2
" i do n't have any intelligence as yet , so what i am going to say is my personal view , " @entity15 said , " there are two terrorist states capable of conducting such a complex operation -- @entity148 and @entity149 -- but neither have much to gain and everything to lose from attacking the @entity67 " the @entity4 affair : a lot more than sex @entity15 added , " the responsible party is almost certainly a nonstate actor and i have no doubt that the trail will lead to @entity25 and @entity12 , " according to a @entity67 intelligence official with knowledge of the conversation			1
five months later on january 4 , 2002 , again at @entity27 's vacation ranch in @entity87 , @entity15 had the delicate task of informing the president that it was the @entity3 's assessment @entity25 had fought at the @entity166 in eastern @entity52 during mid-december 2001 , but he had survived and escaped			1
@entity27 was incensed at this and became hostile , as if @entity15 himself were the culprit			2
flash forward to the summer of 2011 : @entity15 , an unassuming , scholarly analyst in his mid- 50s who speaks in terse , cogent paragraphs , was now the deputy director of the @entity3			1
he was one of a small group of officials at the agency who knew there was a quite promising lead on the possible whereabouts of @entity25 that led to a large compound in the northern @entity179 city of @entity180			0
then - cia director @entity181 , together with @entity15 and some of the analysts working on the hunt for @entity25 , went to @entity1 and told him , " we think there is a strong possibility that @entity25 is in the @entity180 compound			1
" the analysts believed this with varying degrees of certainty , with most estimating the probability at 80 %			0
the lead analyst was at around 90 % , while @entity15 was at 60 %			0
" why do people have different probabilities ? " @entity1 asked			0
" intelligence is not an exact science , " @entity15 explained			0
" even if we had a source inside the compound saying @entity25 was there , i 'd only be at 80 % because sources are of varying reliability			0
those analysts who are at 80 % to 90 % have been tracking @entity12 in recent years and have had great success stopping plots and undermining the organization			0
the folks at the lower end of the range are those who lived through intelligence failures , particularly the @entity210 ( weapons of mass destruction ) issue			0
" of course , we now know that @entity25 was indeed hiding in the compound in @entity180 , and the fact that @entity15 was the overall manager of the investigation that led to @entity12 's leader will surely weigh in his favor to be the nominee for the top job at @entity3			1
given the personal problems that have faced @entity4 and now perhaps gen. @entity223 , the outgoing commander in @entity52 , character issues will surely weigh heavily in @entity1 's considerations			1
@entity4 biographer made trips to @entity52 there are others whom @entity1 might pick to run the @entity3 , such as @entity229 , his top counterterrorism adviser , who had a distinguished career at the agency , including a tour as station chief in @entity234 and who also led both the @entity236 and its successor , the @entity238 , following the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity229 , a no - nonsense graduate of @entity240 who speaks @entity241 , was @entity1 's first pick for @entity3 director in 2008 but withdrew his name from consideration after it became clear that his nomination hearings would be complicated by some in @entity56 who would grill him about the waterboarding of detainees in @entity3 custody and the agency 's prisons overseas			1
it 's also not clear why @entity229 would want the @entity3 job given the fact that in his present position he gets to see the president far more often than any @entity3 director , and from his windowless office in the basement of the @entity260 of the @entity261 , he has dominated @entity67 counterterrorism policy on issues such as drones , @entity179 , @entity265 and the hunt for @entity12 's leaders , including @entity25			1
another plausible candidate is @entity68			0
he had a storied career at the @entity3 , where as a young man he was the agency 's principal military strategist on the @entity52 " account " during the 1980s war against the @entity274			0
@entity68 helped to funnel vast numbers of weapons through the @entity179 to the various @entity52 mujahedeen groups that defeated the @entity274			0
timeline of the @entity4 affair @entity281 ' doctorate in military history from @entity283 and owlish exterior mask the fact that he is a risk taker , albeit in a calibrated , cerebral way			0
he left the @entity3 when he was only 32 , having already played a key role in the most successful covert operation in the agency 's history -- expelling the @entity274 from @entity52 -- to get an mba at @entity293			2
and he was a @entity294 officer in @entity295			0
like both @entity15 and @entity229 , @entity68 also played a key role in the operation to find @entity25			1
in his previous job at the @entity70 , he was the civilian overseer of @entity294 and was intimately involved in the planning of the @entity302 raid in @entity180			0
but unlike @entity15 and @entity229 , @entity68 was n't at the @entity3 when waterboarding and other coercive interrogation techniques were being employed by the agency			1
given all the consternation on @entity307 about the circumstances surrounding the attack on the @entity67 @entity310 in @entity311 , @entity312 , in september in which the @entity67 ambassador was killed along with two @entity3 employees , the @entity1 administration could decide to tap someone who has deep experience on the @entity317			1
an obvious candidate would be @entity319 , who as a member of the @entity321 from @entity322 between 1993 and 2011 served on all the major committees focused on national security : @entity325			0
now running the @entity326 in @entity120 , @entity319 is regarded as one of the @entity329 's leading experts on national security			0
if appointed and confirmed , @entity319 would be the first woman director of the @entity3			2
a further consideration : another former nine - term @entity121 congressman from @entity322 , @entity181 , now the defense secretary , led the @entity3 for more than two years and is regarded as one of the most effective directors of the agency in recent decades			0
( note : an earlier version of this article incorrectly said @entity15 was executive assistant to @entity3 director @entity339 during the presidency of @entity27			1
) @entity341 to investigate why @entity58 did n't notify @entity56			0

@entity343 : president @entity1 has several qualified choices for replacing @entity4
he says some could face questions on @entity3 interrogation techniques , secret prisons
acting director @entity15 had key part in response to 9/11 , search for @entity25
other candidates include @entity229 , @entity68 and @entity66
