-- for a player to succeed in the high pressured , multi-million dollar world of professional golf they must marry their special talent to an unshakable sense of determination			1
that should n't be a problem for @entity12 @entity11 rookie @entity10			1
after two heart transplants , the 32 - year - old @entity12 has finally earned the chance to compete on the @entity11 , fulfilling a destiny that had seemed a distant dream			1
" what i did was pretty special , considering where i 'd been and what i 'd had to deal with , " @entity10 told @entity0 ahead of his debut as a full - time card - holder in @entity19 this week			1
" it was very overwhelming			0
" i could n't believe it when i made the @entity11 -- i 've had to fight for everything my entire life , so you think , ' did that really happen ? ' " @entity10 had been toiling on the second - tier @entity28 , but victory at the @entity30 helped him finish 13th on the money list and secured his place for 2012 alongside stars such as @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			1
" i got sick right after that tournament , i ended up in hospital , and the doctors put me on a lot of medication -- that 's when it sunk in and i realized what i 'd accomplished			0
" @entity45 : rise of the golfing machines ? @entity10 was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy at the age of nine , a condition that limits the heart 's capacity to pump blood , and had his first transplant three years later			1
heavy medication restricted a sport - obsessed kid who was once bigger and faster than most of his peers , stunting his growth			1
but as he got stronger in his teens , his love for golf flourished			2
by 1998 @entity10 was ranked as the top junior in the @entity12 , competing against -- and beating -- the likes of 2008 @entity64 champion @entity64 and current world number six @entity65			1
but bad health still dogged his progress , and even caused him to pass out during an early attempt at the @entity11 's qualifying school			1
after appearing in the @entity71 , a team event between the best amateurs from the @entity12 and @entity74 , he turned pro. despite taking the order of merit on the @entity77 in 2004 , and winning an event in @entity79 in 2005 , @entity10 was far from fulfilling his potential when his health began to deteriorate again in 2007			1
fit - again @entity83 scores win in @entity19 he was on course to make the cut at an event in @entity87 , until a hook out of bounds on a closing hole resulted in him taking a nine shots and a making early exit from the tournament			2
as fate would have it , it was one of his worst shots that saved his life			0
" i would n't be alive if i had made that cut , " he said			2
" the only reason i survived was because i was close enough to drive to the hospital when i felt a heart attack coming on and they put in a stent immediately			2
" @entity10 's heart attack -- known as a " widowmaker " because few survive its intensity -- forced another anxious period spent waiting for a donor			1
" obviously , it put things in perspective , all i wanted to do was stay alive , " he explained			2
" i was sitting in a chair , coughing up blood -- i could n't breathe at night			0
i thought maybe i 'll just have a house and live a quiet life			0
" i never really enjoyed life until after a few weeks , the heart was shutting down , i could n't sleep			2
just doing simple things , lying down on couch watching tv , i would instantly start coughing up blood			0
" surviving one heart transplant , let alone two , is a feat to be proud of , but @entity10 says it took less than a week after surgery for his mind to turn to swinging a club again			1
incredibly , just five months later he made a return to competitive action , tying for 60th at the @entity132 on the @entity11 -- a high - pressure elite circuit where millions of dollars are at stake every weekend			1
his courage , and talent , propelled him into the limelight			0
" the surgeons thought i was crazy , " he laughed			0
" i slowly picked up my swing ; i was n't as strong as i am now but i figured out a way to get it done			0
i have a gift to be able to play sport and have the co-ordination to do it , so i 've been blessed that way -- not so blessed in other things			2
" @entity10 's desire to fulfill his dream of qualifying for a @entity11 card helped to energize his recovery , as did the birth of his first child -- another miracle given that doctors had been unsure if he 'd be able to have kids due to the medication he has taken all his life			1
he gradually regained full power but did have to seek special dispensation from the authorities to use a golf cart to get round the course , and to be absolved from their drug testing process , due to the medication that was vital for his survival			2
" i got some letters from @entity166 saying i was compromising the integrity of the game by using a cart and that @entity170 never would have done that ! my goal was not to use it but , hey , there may be one day i have to use it again			0
" in 2009 @entity10 received the @entity175 , for courage , presented to him by golfing legend @entity178 , and after two steady seasons he clinched his @entity11 place with that momentous win in @entity182			1
" the whole of last season was tough , i was playing but i was n't 100 % , " he said ahead of thursday 's opening round at the @entity184			1
" this year coming up i 'm really excited playing on the @entity11 -- i 've played a lot of events in the past but now i 'm healthy and i can handle a lot of it			1
" the only issue i have is trying to capitalize -- 100 % for me , is maybe 65 - 70 % for someone else , so when i have a cold or i 'm not feeling the best it 's hard to compete at a high level			2
" my body has taken a hit over the years , i do n't know the difference because i feel pretty strong , but that 's the stuff i deal with on a day to day basis			0
my immune system is lower so i catch more colds and it takes me longer to fight them off but i 'm used to that			0
" @entity10 's inspirational journey is sure to make even more headlines now that he will be playing side by side with the best golfers on the planet every week			1
" i just try to live my own life and make the best out of what i can -- if that inspires others then that 's great			0
but i 'm just trying to live my life the best i can , " he said			0
" i think the message is more powerful than the game itself because it can touch everybody			0
i enjoy speaking my message to those who understand and get life , i do n't enjoy telling it to people who do n't understand			0
" @entity228 has given me a reason to get out of my bed , so it 's been very important			0
i 'm very blessed to have a passion and ability			0
@entity228 has kept me alive , there 's no doubt about it			0

he won the @entity30 in 2011 to seal his *lifelong* dream of playing on the @entity11
