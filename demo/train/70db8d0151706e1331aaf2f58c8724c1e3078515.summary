@entity0 -- @entity2 can be expected to be personally furious and potentially devastated by the partisan - but - damning judgment of a committee of @entity6 lawmakers that he is not a " fit " person to run an international business			1
this choice of wording is powerful for two reasons : one immediately damaging to @entity12 and its ambitions to take full control of the prize asset of @entity16 , and the second personally damaging for the 81 - year - old @entity2			1
to hold a broadcasting license in @entity6 the corporation controlling the television station must itself pass a test that its executives are " fit and proper			0
" within minutes of the parliamentary @entity24 and @entity25 publishing its judgment about @entity2 's behavior and deeper condemnation of the culture at @entity12 the @entity6 regulator of television and broadcasting , @entity33 , reiterated in response to a query that it is investigating his status as a leading shareholder in @entity16			1
the committee 's words -- made publicly and with the protection of parliamentary privilege from legal action by @entity43 -- also take @entity2 back decades to one of the greatest rivalries of his career with the late @entity48 - born publishing magnate @entity47			1
critics often compared @entity47 and @entity2 in the same sentence , something @entity2 is known to hate since he saw @entity47 while alive as a charlatan			2
@entity47 's death led to even greater revelations that he was also at the head of a conspiracy to defraud staff pension - funds controlled by his companies			0
no one has suggested @entity2 is guilty of financial misconduct in the current controversy which has spanned illegal telephone hacking , alleged corruption of police and civil servants and undue influence over politicians			2
@entity2 , who values his personal reputation for probity as much as he honors the memory of his father @entity72 as a campaigning journalist and newspaper proprietor , will not miss the similarity of the language used by the select committee in tuesday 's judgment and that used by then @entity80 's damning judgment in 1971 that @entity47 was " unfit " to run a public company			1
that judgment hung heavily on @entity47 's reputation for the rest of his life			0
of course , @entity47 did go on to run a major public company , which after his mysterious death at sea off his luxury yacht in november 1991 was found to have taken more than Â £ 400 million ( $ 648 million ) from staff pension funds in attempts to prop up its failing businesses			0
those who forced the tough language through into the committee report will have been in no doubt that the comparison with @entity47 would be made by those with long memories -- no more so the trade unionists @entity2 stomped on and the right - wing establishment he disdained -- and how much it would sting @entity2			1
@entity104 and @entity105 members of the select committee forced the " not fit " judgment through the minority of their conservative committee colleagues though the other stinging criticisms of @entity12 were unanimous including that it had been misled by @entity12 executives			0
the report has no legal force but comes with the stamp of parliamentary authority and follows many months of investigation and open hearings , including with @entity2 and his son @entity119			0
based on two major biographies , it is clear that @entity2 is known to loathe any parallel between himself and @entity47			2
the words of the select committee will bring that into sharp relief , providing ammunition to a section of the @entity6 establishment which has never liked the @entity131 publisher and seen him as polluting their vision of @entity6 life			0
for his part , @entity2 has historically relished taking on the effete of @entity6 , variously accusing them of wanting to turn the country into a museum and recently portraying the crisis swirling around him as the work of " enemies many different agendas , but worst old toffs and right - wingers who still want last century 's status quo with their monopolies			1
" despite now perhaps actually being the establishment , @entity2 still sees himself as the " @entity131 battler " against entrenched interest groups , particularly in the highly class - based @entity6 establishment			2
he is likely to see the damning select committee report -- with its strong language forced through by trade - union - backed @entity104 politicians with a visceral dislike of his power and wealth -- in the same terms but the comparison with a crook like @entity47 will infuriate and hurt him			1
and this report is only the latest wave in an ongoing tsunami of bad news			0
@entity12 and @entity2 still have to face months of further revelations about telephone hacking at the @entity175 , over-close relationships with police and civil servants and his empire and the embarrassing exposure of just how close relationships were between @entity12 and politicians of all major parties in @entity6 .			0

@entity6 media regulator @entity33 says it is investigating @entity2 's status as a leading shareholder in @entity16
lawmakers ' report used language that may evoke comparisons between @entity2 and rival @entity2
@entity188 : @entity2 is not guilty of financial crimes -- but comparison with @entity47 will infuriate and hurt him
