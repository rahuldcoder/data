-- as so often happens in big international confrontations , @entity1 is devolving into a complicated mess from which no one has yet outlined a reasonable retreat acceptable to all sides			1
@entity7 did not push into @entity8 just to put its tanks in reverse and go home			1
the @entity1 government ca n't very well tolerate a land grab within 400 miles of @entity14			1
and the big @entity17 powers , including the @entity18 , have raised so many threats and objections , they will look weak , dishonest , or both if nothing is done now			0
so let 's sort through some options as laid out by many of our expert analysts on @entity0			0
1 ) going to the guns : this is a good one to dispense with first , because no one wants it			0
@entity1 , absent massive and sustained outside help , would be decimated by the @entity7 bear			1
the @entity7 are better trained , better equipped and better funded			1
by virtue of geography and their superior navy , they would start the fight with @entity1 60 % encircled by hostile forces			1
but @entity7 has reason to keep the pistols holstered , too			2
turning eastern @entity1 into a battlefield would disrupt critical industry , agriculture , and oil and gas sales in the region for years			2
also , a pitched battle could draw in other players , and then the whole @entity51 discussion lights up			0
2 ) @entity7 retreats : unlikely			2
they did n't steam into @entity8 just for a getaway weekend			0
the @entity7 have important assets to protect there , and that does not necessarily mean the 60 % of the @entity8 population that grew up speaking @entity7			2
the vaunted @entity58 counts on its @entity60 port for year - round access ( via @entity62 ) to the warm waters of the @entity64			0
arguably , the fear of losing that route to an unfriendly @entity1 government is what drove @entity7 to take @entity8 in the first place			1
leaked call raises questions about who was behind sniper attacks in @entity1 3 ) @entity7 retreats with some conditions : more likely			1
what conditions ? @entity8 leaders have already voted to leave @entity1 and rejoin @entity7 which was home until 1954 , when @entity7 gave @entity8 to @entity1			1
@entity8 voters will have a chance to ratify or reject this decision in the next couple of weeks , even as @entity14 says they have no right to redraw the national borders			0
in any event , this is one possibility : @entity8 becomes a part of @entity7 , or a semi-independent nation with great affection for @entity7 ( read : a puppet state ready to do whatever @entity89 wants )			2
or @entity7 gets a permanent agreement to turn @entity60 into @entity7 territory , like the arrangement the @entity18 has with @entity93 in @entity94			2
no matter how that plays out , @entity7 denies ever having designs on all of this -- even as the mysterious troops in the peninsula melt away , the rest of the world grumbles , and @entity1 goes back to trying to pay its debts			1
4 ) @entity7 advances : not content with @entity8 and eager to show @entity14 just who they are messing with , the @entity7 storm across the border and take much of eastern @entity1			1
no one knows if this is in @entity7 president @entity111 's plans , but if it happens ... see option @entity113			2
5 ) the western world turns on the squeeze play : the @entity117 appears to want a unified effort in which nations all over the globe use their political and economic might to punish @entity7 and leave the new @entity1 government triumphant			1
problem is , several big countries seem reluctant to take that course , and unless everyone is on the same page , any sanctions would be weakened			0
and even though it was hit hard in 2008 by the recession , @entity7 is not @entity130 , @entity131 , or @entity132			0
this is a big nation that is unlikely to buckle quickly to any amount of pressure			0
@entity18 intelligence under fire over @entity1 the takeaway : there are plenty of other possibilities , but conventional wisdom says these are the most likely options at the moment			0
the biggest danger ? everyone is wrong ... and some unforeseen , uncontrolled options arise , making the situation not better , but even worse			0
@entity150 : how @entity1 is divided			0

possible end games include everything from war to @entity7 retreat
the most likely outcome involves @entity7 retreating with conditions
