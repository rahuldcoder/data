@entity0 -- @entity3 's prime minister vowed to wind down the month - long crisis at the @entity6 power plant " at all costs " tuesday after his government officially designated the situation there a @entity12 - level nuclear accident			1
prime minister @entity13 said he wants the plant 's owner , the @entity16 , to produce a timetable for bringing the disaster to an end , " and they will be doing that soon			1
" and a day after his government warned that thousands more people would need to be evacuated from the surrounding region , he pledged to provide jobs , housing and education for those uprooted by the accident			0
@entity3 leader invokes @entity29 to urge quake recovery " the government will not forsake the people who are suffering because of the nuclear accident , " @entity13 told reporters in a tuesday evening news conference			2
@entity3 declared the @entity6 crisis a level 7 event on the international system for rating nuclear accidents tuesday , putting it on par with the @entity12 in the @entity41			1
the top - scale designation was based on the massive release of radioactivity since the accident began , particularly in its early days , and classifies @entity6 a " major accident " requiring long - term countermeasures			2
" at all costs , all the reactors and the spent nuclear fuel pools must be brought under control so that we can prevent a further expansion of the damage , " @entity13 said			0
@entity55 , a former nuclear engineer - turned - industry critic , told @entity1 the declaration has no immediate practical impact on the crisis			0
but it 's a sign that @entity3 regulators have rethought their earlier assessments of the disaster , said @entity55 , who now runs an alternative energy think - tank in @entity0			1
analysis : @entity6 and the ' nuclear renaissance ' that was n't @entity16 's president , @entity67 , issued a new apology for the disaster and the " enormous anxiety " it has caused after the @entity72 designation tuesday			1
" we would like to stabilize the situation as soon as possible , and we are working on the measures and steps to cool the reactors and prevent the spread of nuclear substances , " he said			0
" while continuing to ask for the support and cooperation of the government , the ministries , and the municipalities , we would like to maintain close communication with them , and we will make the utmost effort to bring the situation to an end			2
" scientists believe the amount of radiation released is only a tenth of what was released at @entity12 , said @entity95 , the chief spokesman for @entity3 's @entity96			1
but the levels for radioactive iodine and cesium that have been spewed into the air , water and soil around the plant are in the thousands of trillions of bequerels -- 15 times higher than the threshold for a top - scale event , according to figures released by the safety agency tuesday morning			0
the crisis began with the march 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern @entity3			2
the tsunami knocked out the plant 's cooling systems , leaving operators with no way to keep the three operational reactors from overheating after they shut down			0
interactive explainer : @entity3 's nuclear concerns engineers are now pumping hundreds of tons of water a day into the damaged reactors to keep them cool , but @entity16 said long - term solutions must wait until it can get the highly contaminated water out of the basements of the units ' turbine plants			1
in addition , more water is being poured into pools housing spent but still - potent fuel rods in units 1 - 3 as well as unit 4 , which had no fuel in the reactor at the time of the quake			0
the work has been complicated over the past five days by a series of powerful aftershocks that have forced workers to clear out of the units and seek shelter			0
monday , @entity3 ordered new evacuations for towns around the plant , including some outside the 20 - and 30 - km danger zones drawn in the early days of the accident , and warned others to stand by			2
but after tuesday 's declaration , both @entity95 and chief cabinet secretary @entity152 tried to draw distinctions between their crisis and @entity12			1
" what 's different here from the @entity12 accident is that we have not yet seen a direct impact on the health of the people as a result of the nuclear accident , " said @entity152 , the @entity3 government 's leading spokesman on the crisis			1
" the accident itself is big , but we will make , as our first priority , our utmost effort to avoid any health impact on the people			0
" and @entity95 said that unlike the @entity12 , the reactors inside the badly damaged buildings at @entity6 remain largely intact , " although there are some leaks being seen			1
" " in the case of @entity12 , the radioactive material release made it very difficult to enter the facility itself , " he said			2
" it had to be left alone for a very long time by itself			0
but it in the @entity6 case , day and night , workers are there trying to salvage the situation			2
" @entity189 , a researcher for the anti-nuclear group @entity190 , told @entity1 that @entity3 authorities were " too slow " to respond to the crisis at first -- but they have stepped up their efforts in recent days due to pressure from local officials , outside critics and their own people			1
now , he said , they have to step up their plans to evacuate towns that have been dusted with large quantities of longer - lived radioactive particles			0
@entity3 marks 1 month since deadly quake , tsunami " there are still a lot of measures to be done , but they have to do it now , " said @entity189 , who has studied the aftereffects of @entity12			1
@entity189 said @entity190 , which called for evacuations in towns outside the 30 - km radius in late march , believes the accident will end up being " worse than @entity12 " because it has occurred in a more densely populated area			1
evacuation orders have so far covered about 85,000 people inside the 20 - kilometer ( 12.4 - mile ) zone , while another 62,000 within 30 kilometers have been told to stay inside , @entity6 prefecture officials told @entity1			2
@entity3 's government said it had no estimate of the number of people who would be covered by the new directives			1
@entity95 said tuesday 's designation was made " provisionally , " and that a final level wo n't be set until the disaster is over and a more detailed investigation has been conducted			1
the previous event level of 5 , equal to the 1979 accident at @entity231 in @entity232 , was also a provisional designation			0
@entity231 involved a partial meltdown of the radioactive core of one reactor , with only a limited release of radioactivity , according to the @entity239			0
at @entity12 , an explosion and fire at a nuclear power plant resulted in the permanent evacuation of a 30 - km radius around the plant			0
there were 32 deaths among plant workers and firefighters , mostly due to radiation exposure , and the @entity251 estimates another 4,000 will or have died of related cancers			0
@entity1 's @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity3 's prime minister vows to end the crisis " at all costs "
new : @entity16 's president issues a new apology for the disaster
the government needs to start evacuations now , a @entity190 researcher says
the level 7 designation puts @entity6 on par with @entity12
