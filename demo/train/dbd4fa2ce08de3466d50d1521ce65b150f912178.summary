the doctor personally visited a @entity112 , @entity1 , pharmacy in september 2006 to get chloral hydrate , a sleep aid , for @entity4 to use in the @entity57			2

" of the 12 medications found in @entity4 's hotel room at the time of her death , seven medications were prescribed in the name of @entity183 ( believed to be @entity12 ) by dr. @entity18 , " @entity155 said			1
the drugs were apparently personally delivered to @entity4 in the @entity57 and @entity22 by her doctor , @entity155 said			2
" it is reasonable to believe that dr. @entity18 provided @entity4 prescription medications and controlled substances by transporting them from @entity1 to @entity118 , @entity57 with her on her travels to visit @entity4 , " @entity155 said			0
