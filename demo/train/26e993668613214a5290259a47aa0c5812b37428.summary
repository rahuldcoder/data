" birdman " won the big prize -- outstanding motion picture cast -- at the @entity2 , but it was talk about heritage and diversity that captured the evening			1
on the tv side , the winners included " @entity11 " -- a series about a women 's prison , created by a woman , featuring a cast that includes a transgender performer -- and black actresses @entity17 and @entity19			1
and the movie winners included @entity21 , who won for a performance in " boyhood " that she filmed over 12 years -- and was n't afraid to show it			2
@entity21 comes from a long line of performers			2
her siblings , including @entity28 and @entity29 , are actors			2
@entity30 was her father and grandfather			2
she paid tribute to all of them in her speech			1
" i 'm a fourth - generation actor , " she said , visibly overwrought , adding that her family has been performing for more than a century			0
but it was the wins by @entity38 , @entity19 and " @entity39 " that caught the attention of social media , which erupted 10 days ago when the @entity43 nominations put forth a very un-diverse crowd			1
complete list of winners @entity38 ' speech , in particular , was particularly moving			1
after beginning with an observation about how she tells her daughter stories , she paid tribute to the producers who thought of her for their " how to @entity56 " story			0
" i 'd like to thank @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 for thinking that a sexualized , messy , mysterious woman could be a 49 - year - old dark - skinned @entity63 - @entity62 woman who looks like me , " she said			0
several tweeters highlighted her words and their significance			0
in general , however , the @entity67 were a relatively quiet and brisk affair			1
( yes , it can happen , even for @entity72 awards shows			0
) the film awards generally went as expected , with @entity21 , @entity74 ( " @entity78 " ) , @entity75 ( " @entity79 " ) , @entity76 ( " @entity77 " ) and " birdman " taking home the trophies			1
only @entity76 was a mild surprise , given that " birdman 's " @entity85 has been considered the leader in the best actor race by a number of handicappers			1
the actors ' branch is the largest bloc of @entity43 voters , so the @entity67 are closely watched for indicators about which way the @entity43 wind is blowing			1
still , the @entity67 had their moments			1
there were @entity38 ' and @entity19 's emotional speeches , of course			0
and there were also a few laughs			0
@entity102 got some chuckles for turning her speech into a cheeky bit of promotion for her film , " @entity108 " ( " you can stream it -- i do n't know how			2
you can watch it on an intercontinental flight , i 've been told			0
you can get the dvds on february 9 , give it to someone as a @entity115 present ! " she said ) and the witty @entity117 got off a couple jokes while introducing her mother , @entity119 , who won a lifetime achievement award			0
" birdman " took home only one prize in the end , but it was the biggest one of the night			1
it also won at the @entity127 saturday			0
how that will fly at the @entity43 , however , is anyone 's guess			0
how the winners reacted backstage			0

@entity17 ' speech , " @entity39 " *showcase* tv diversity at @entity67
" birdman " wins big prize for films
