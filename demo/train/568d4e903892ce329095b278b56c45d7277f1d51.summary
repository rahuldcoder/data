in the @entity2 , a ban on abortion is preventing a teenage girl from receiving treatment for a life - threatening disease			1
at the @entity7 in the captial city of @entity9 , a 16 - year - old girl is dying of acute leukemia			1
doctors say the girl , whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy , needs an aggressive chemotherapy treatment			1
but there 's one problem : the teenager is nine weeks pregnant and treatment would very likely terminate the pregnancy , a violation of @entity2 anti-abortion laws			1
@entity23 , the girl 's mother , is trying to convince doctors and the @entity2 government to make an exception so that her daughter 's life can be saved			1
" my daughter 's life is first			0
i know that [ abortion ] is a sin and that it goes against the law ... but my daughter 's health is first , " @entity31 said			2
according to @entity42 of the @entity2 constitution , " the right to life is inviolable from the moment of conception and until death			1
" @entity2 courts have interpreted this as a strict mandate against abortion			2
@entity42 37 , passed in 2009 , also abolished the death penalty			1
@entity50 women rally against plans to restrict access to abortion @entity54 , the director of the bioethics council that rules on the application of the law , says the council is leaning toward allowing the treatment			2
" at the end of the day the patient may decide for himself or herself			0
in this case , the family may decide what 's more convenient for the patient , " @entity54 said			0
women 's and human rights groups are outraged , saying the girl should have received chemotherapy immediately			1
@entity71 , a women 's rights activist , complains that conservative politics is preventing necessary treatment to save the teenager 's life			2
" how can it be possible that so much time is being wasted ? that the treatment has n't begun yet because they 're still meeting , trying to decide if she has the right to receive the treatment to save her life -- that 's unacceptable , " @entity71 said			2
some @entity2 opposition lawmakers say there should be a new debate over the abortion ban in the @entity87 country and the problems created by the constitutional ban go beyond this case			1
opinion leaders like former representative @entity92 say clandestine abortions are also putting the lives of many women at risk			0
" the constitution is going to have to be modified sooner rather than later , " @entity92 said			0
" we can not allow under any circumstances that pregnancies that present complications for women be permitted to continue as normal			0
" @entity102 , the @entity2 minister of health , has publicly indicated he favors chemotherapy over protecting the pregnancy , but doctors are still reluctant to act for fear of prosecution			1
@entity108 , one of the architects of @entity42 , says the constitutional ban does not prevent doctors from administering the treatment			2
it does , however , prevent them from practicing an abortion in order to treat the patient with chemotherapy			0
" it 's an artificial debate , " @entity108 said			0
" what we have clearly said is that in this case doctors are authorized by the constitution to treat the patient			0
they do n't have to worry about anything			0
they have the mandate of protecting both lives			0
" and while the debate rages on around the country , back at the hospital the clock keeps ticking for the 16 - year - old pregnant girl			1
activists allege forced abortions , sterilizations in @entity136			0

a 16 - year - old girl with leukemia has n't received treatment because she 's pregnant
@entity42 37 of the @entity2 's constitution forbids abortion
chemotherapy for the girl 's illness will likely terminate her pregnancy
*incident* has *sparked* a *renewed* debate on abortion laws in the country
