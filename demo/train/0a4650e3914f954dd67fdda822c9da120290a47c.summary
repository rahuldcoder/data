-- @entity1 is dead and probably does n't care , but a pardon for the cold - blooded killer may be in the offing			1
gov. @entity6 , called a " @entity1 buff , " is looking at an old promise by another governor , and not the @entity11 's reputation , in deciding whether to issue a posthumous pardon , a spokeswoman said thursday			1
no matter that @entity1 has been in the ground since 1881			2
that has n't dimmed interest in the cattle - rustling outlaw			0
tourists , especially from @entity19 , are fascinated with @entity1 , born @entity1 , but also known as @entity1 and @entity1			2
he died at the hands of sheriff @entity21 when he was only 21			1
@entity23 's tourism website even has a travel guide to @entity1 territory			1
" his nickname carries a lyrical quality that still gallops across the high plains of our imagination , " according to the text next to the only known photograph of @entity1			2
" if he does anything , [ @entity6 ] will review the promise made by @entity39 to @entity1 , " @entity33 , @entity6 's communications director , said thursday , a day after the governor met with descendants of @entity21			1
the @entity21 family and others oppose the pardon			1
besides arguing that @entity1 was an incorrigible killer , they want to make sure @entity21 is absolved of wrongdoing related to the killing and a @entity1 jail escape			1
@entity47 , 51 , two other grandchildren and two great - grandchildren of @entity21 met for an hour with @entity6			2
" people had forgotten that @entity21 was one of the first individuals to bring law and order to @entity55 , " @entity50 said			0
this latest chapter in the story of @entity21 and @entity1 has more twists than a lariat			1
popular history has @entity1 gunning down 21 men , but many historians say the number was closer to nine			0
according to other legends , @entity1 did not die at @entity21 's hands and is not buried in @entity66 , @entity23			1
he went to @entity68 and became known as " @entity69 , they say			0
poppycock , the @entity70 argue			0
they asked @entity6 to sign a petition signed by 100 people that reads , " whereas we the undersigned accept and agree the traditional history of sheriff @entity21 and @entity1 ( @entity1 ) , and believe that @entity1 died at @entity21 's hand			1
therefore we oppose a postphumous ( sic ) pardon for @entity1 as @entity76			1
" @entity21 killed @entity1 on july 14 , 1881 , in @entity66 weeks after @entity1 escaped from a jail			1
the sheriff , legend has it , was hiding in the dark and shot @entity1 when he entered a room			1
@entity21 himself was gunned down in 1908 at age 57			0
@entity6 " agrees with the heart of the petition , " but is asking his legal department to look at it , @entity85 said			0
but the petition does n't affect the @entity39 matter			0
@entity91 , author of " @entity92 on a @entity93 : @entity1 , @entity21 , and the @entity97 to @entity98 in the @entity99 , " called for a pardon in an op - ed piece last month for the @entity96			1
according to @entity91 and other historians , @entity1 wrote to @entity39 , then the @entity23 territory 's governor , asking him to honor a deal			1
@entity39 had promised to grant @entity1 amnesty for his role in shooting @entity55 sheriff @entity106 and other " misdeeds " if he agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating another murder			2
the pardon did n't happen			0
the @entity70 argue @entity1 decided to flee house arrest , making the pardon moot			2
" still , regardless of @entity1 's crimes , the motives of @entity6 or the hollowness of posthumous justice , it all comes back to @entity39 's promise			2
a deal is a deal , and 129 years does n't change that			0
@entity1 is owed a pardon , " @entity91 wrote			2
@entity122 , 72 , of @entity123 , @entity23 , said he opposes the pardon			2
his grandfather was @entity21 's brother			1
" i am very passionate about this , " @entity21 said			0
" he [ @entity1 ] was a killer			0
" @entity21 , who was not at wednesday 's meeting but has written to @entity6 , said @entity39 did not exonerate @entity1			1
" i think he might be better off doing something else , " @entity122 , a retired bailiff , said of @entity6			0
@entity6 has been interested in @entity1 officially since 2003			0
" he thought it would be interesting to review this promise by @entity39 , " said @entity85			0
a sheriff , a deputy and others got involved and moved to have the bodies of @entity1 and his mother exhumed for dna testing to prove they are buried at the @entity138			2
but a judge ruled against the efforts			0
@entity6 was n't interested in that aspect and the group 's interest in whether @entity1 became " @entity144 , @entity85 said			2
@entity85 disputed contentions that the sheriff was following orders from @entity6			0
according to a letter the @entity70 wrote to the governor , @entity6 declared support in 2003 for reopening the investigation of @entity1 's death			1
the investigation cited probable cause for allegations that @entity21 killed an innocent victim instead of @entity1 and that person is buried in the outlaw 's grave , the @entity70 said			1
there also were allegations the sheriff was an accomplice of @entity1 in the murder of two deputies in april 1881 and the rustler 's subsequent escape			1
" this is an abomination as well as an inexcusable defamation of a great man , " the letter said of the claims			0
@entity85 said @entity6 , who leaves office in five months , had nothing to do with the probable cause claims			0
" the governor told them [ the @entity70 ] that sheriff @entity21 was an honorable man			1
" she also denied state money went toward the investigation			0
former @entity55 sheriff @entity179 was among those involved in the investigation			0
he opposes the pardon , saying @entity1 " was nothing but a glorified cop killer , " but said there are many questions about the circumstances of his death and @entity21 's conduct			1
he said he raised the probable cause questions so that an investigation would glean what really happened with @entity21 and @entity1			1
" nobody wants to know the truth , " @entity179 said thursday			0
@entity50 and others in the family said they will continue their campaign to clear @entity21 , who they said enjoyed a little gambling			2
they are hoping @entity6 wo n't issue a pardon			0
" if @entity1 was living amongst us now , would you issue a pardon for someone who made his living as a thief and , more egregiously , who killed four law enforcement officers and numerous others ? " the @entity21 family wrote @entity6			1
author @entity91 said there is a reason for an abiding interest in @entity1 and curiosity about whether he actually died in the dark and did not escape			0
" if you have a folk hero die , you want him to go out with a blaze of glory			0

@entity23 governor considers pardoning @entity1
descendants of the sheriff who killed @entity1 ask him not to do so
@entity21 's family says @entity1 was a murderer not *worthy* of pardon
