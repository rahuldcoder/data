-- as human rights advocates around the world celebrate the 64th anniversary of the @entity7 this week , their counterparts in the @entity3 are mourning the @entity9 's rejection last week of the international convention for disability rights			1
appalling in its own right , the @entity13 ' defeat of the 21st century 's first human rights treaty is a sad but sharp reminder that misinformation and fear can still override fundamental principles of human decency and common sense			1
more importantly , it is yet another blow to the @entity3 ' ability to play a leading role in promoting freedoms and human dignity in the world			2
the international bill of rights adopted by the @entity31 on december 10 , 1948 , still stands as the gold standard in the daily fight for basic human rights today			1
as our societies democratize , mature and progress , human rights defenders are winning longstanding battles to expand the frontiers of rights to include women , children , indigenous peoples , @entity46 communities and migrants			2
economic and social rights are ascendant as well , as people make claims for the essentials of human life : water , food , health , jobs and education			2
the @entity3 has a long and generally bipartisan tradition of concern for human rights , a pillar of its founding principles			1
@entity3 also have been at the forefront of the global human rights movement for generations and consider ourselves a leading example for others of a rights - respecting society , even if we still have much work to do to improve our record			1
indeed , it was @entity74 ' passage of the @entity75 in 1990 that paved the way for the international campaign for disability rights and which served as the standard for the treaty the @entity9 rejected			1
when it comes to international law , however , some @entity3 get confused			2
the image of the @entity31 as a supranational body with powers to insert itself into our living rooms persists even though there is no evidence to support it			2
this myth - making , and its inherent contradictions , are in full display in @entity96 's bizarre opinion essay published last week in @entity97			0
in it , the leader of the conservative movement , to defeat the treaty , claims that unelected @entity31 bureaucrats could take away a parent 's power to demand special education services for a disabled child			0
he then asserts that there is no point in ratifying the treaty because it " would do nothing to force any foreign government to change their laws or to spend resources on the disabled			0
that is for those governments to decide			0
the hallmark of the @entity31 human rights system is its success in elaborating international standards for protecting a comprehensive set of human rights , monitoring states ' respect for those rights and making recommendations for improving their records			1
in exceptional cases involving gross violations , such as war crimes and mass atrocities , governments ( though not the @entity3 ) have agreed to a more robust set of mechanisms , like the @entity135 , to hold individuals accountable			0
the emerging doctrine of responsibility to protect civilians has even been applied to prevent the slaughter of civilians in @entity142			0
but these measures are a far cry from any alleged interference of @entity31 lawyers in our schools and homes			0
at the end of the day , however , national sovereignty trumps these efforts , leaving any state free to follow its own path for governing its people			0
for better or worse , that 's the way it works			0
there is a broader and more disheartening message that the world hears from @entity162 on this year 's @entity163 : the @entity3 is losing its moral voice on human rights because it is not leading by example			1
as one human rights defender remarked to me recently , his government routinely cites @entity3 treatment of detainees at @entity173 as justification for its own violations of human rights			1
when the exceptional case , like the " necessary " measures adopted to wage battle against terrorists , becomes the norm , we have lost a major source of credibility to promote basic principles of due process and " innocent until proven guilty			0
" unfortunately , the conservative movement 's victory in defeating the disability rights treaty is just the latest example of our political leaders ' failure to convert high - sounding rhetoric into meaningful action when it comes to human rights			1
if a war hero @entity195 like @entity196 , who uses a wheelchair , can not persuade his colleagues to do the right thing , then we are all the losers in the battle for human rights			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0

last week , @entity9 @entity195 defeated the international convention for disability rights
misinformation and fear overrode decency and common sense , says @entity204
*opponents* *argued* that the @entity31 could deny parents their rights to raise children as they see fit
@entity3 is losing its moral voice on human rights because it is not leading by example , he says
