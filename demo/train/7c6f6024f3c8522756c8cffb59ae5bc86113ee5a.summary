-- @entity1 began releasing more than two dozen @entity3 prisoners late tuesday , a goodwill gesture on the eve of new peace talks that have been complicated by @entity1 plans for new housing in @entity9			1
the vans began pulling away from the @entity1 prison in @entity12 shortly before 10 p.m. ( 3 p.m. et ) , carrying the 26 freed inmates to flag - waving receptions in the @entity15 and @entity16			1
one group was handed over the @entity3 officials at the @entity1 prison at @entity20 and they were driven to meet with @entity22 president @entity21 in nearby @entity23			1
as they were driven away , @entity3 youths outside started throwing stones at the prison , where guards responded by firing stun grenades and tear gas			1
some of the @entity3 had been held for more than 20 years			2
but as the vans rolled away , a group of demonstrators waved signs condemning the release , complaining that the prisoners had @entity1 blood on their hands			1
in approving the release , a committee of @entity1 cabinet ministers stressed " that if any of the released prisoners return to hostile activity against the state of @entity1 , they will be returned to continue serving their sentences			1
" @entity21 announced the release of the prisoners was just the beginning			1
" we say to them and the rest who will follow , this is the beginning and there are other brothers who will be returning and be amongst you soon , " he said			0
the prisoner release came after @entity1 said it would forge ahead with a plan to build 900 housing units in @entity9 , which the @entity3 hope will be the capital of their future state			1
the issue of @entity1 settlements derailed the last round of direct talks , in 2010 , and critics of @entity1 prime minister @entity67 say building on disputed territory could derail the new talks , slated to start wednesday in @entity9			1
" @entity67 has to decide which government he is heading : a government that is trying to reach a peace agreement , or a government that is trying to undermine all possibilities of this agreement , " said @entity70 , head of the @entity71 and the @entity1 opposition			2
in january , the @entity79 said @entity1 settlements amount to " creeping annexation " of @entity3 territories by @entity1 and have taken a " heavy toll " on the rights and sovereignty of @entity3			1
and in @entity87 , where @entity89 leaders have pushed both sides to return to the table , the @entity86 said it had " serious concerns " with the new announcement			0
" we 've encouraged both sides broadly speaking to refrain from taking steps that could undermine trust			0
we said that from the beginning , " @entity86 spokeswoman @entity98 said			0
but , she added , " we 've also been clear that these are complicated issues , and there will be bumps in the road			0
" @entity104 , a columnist for the online @entity106 news site @entity107 , said the released prisoners are a bargaining chip to make sure the @entity3 do n't back out of the talks despite their anger over new settlements			1
" they 're trapped , and @entity21 has egg on his face today because he ca n't get out of the talks , " @entity104 told @entity0			2
but @entity117 , a veteran @entity106 analyst at the @entity118 , said both sides agreed to resume talks for nine months under @entity89 mediation			2
" this is a significant gesture , so therefore you 're going to hear a lot of noise from both sides -- complaints , grievances , " @entity117 said			0
" but you can pretty much discount most of what you hear in public , because they 're both clearly committed to doing this for nine months			0
and we really need to give it time to see what 's going to happen			0
" both @entity21 and @entity67 are " hemmed in by domestic constraints , " leaving neither side likely to make significant changes on its own , @entity117 said			2
@entity89 secretary of state @entity141 said last week that " many difficult choices " lie ahead for both sides , but held out hope that " reasonable compromises " could be reached			2
@entity117 called that a " weak statement " that downplayed expectations for the talks			0
as a result , most observers have little hope that the talks will produce a breakthrough in the decades - old @entity1 - @entity3 conflict			1
but he said the @entity89 role in the talks is a " wild card " that could defy those expectations			0
" what is the @entity89 going to do ? " he asked			0
" will it push both sides ? will it pressure them ? will it cajole them ? will it entice them , and will it make serious bridging and endgame proposals ? we have no idea about any of that			0
" @entity0 's @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
