if the management and the captain of the sunken tall ship @entity9 had " exercised the proper responsibility , judgment and prudence , " the deaths of two people would have been prevented , according to a @entity12 @entity11 investigation report released thursday			1
nineteen months after the @entity9 sank in @entity13 off @entity14 , and more than a year after investigative hearings , the @entity11 issued a wide range of recommendations in the disaster that killed rookie deckhand @entity19 and left capt. @entity20 missing and presumed dead			1
before it sank roughly 100 miles off @entity22 , the @entity9 was arguably the most famous three - masted wooden square rigger in the world			1
the @entity11 investigation asked life - and - death questions about proper ship maintenance , the crew 's experience and the captain 's decision to sail from @entity32 to @entity33 as @entity13 pointed toward the @entity34			1
the report could determine who , if anyone , might lose maritime licenses as a result of the disaster			2
during the investigation , officials said the report 's findings could be forwarded to prosecutors who would determine whether to file criminal charges			1
a year after @entity9 tragedy , survivors honor victims the " most critical " cause of the sinking , the report said , was the " failure of the @entity9 's management and [ captain ] to exercise effective oversight and risk management in the overall operation of the @entity9 and specifically with undertaking its final voyage in the face of an impending hurricane			1
" the " leading cause that contributed to the loss " of @entity20 and to @entity19 's death was the captain 's " decision to order the crew to abandon the ship much too late , " the report said			1
" it was just so hard , " said @entity9 survivor @entity69 , describing her feelings as the report was made public			1
" it was hard thinking about @entity20 and @entity19			0
" @entity69 , a deckhand on the @entity9 , nearly drowned after @entity13 's winds and waves tossed her and fellow sailors into the @entity76			1
the decision to abandon ship so late after hurricane conditions worsened and the " fact that the crew had not drilled in months , " led the report to determine that the captain 's " actions / and or inactions in this regard constitutes negligence			1
" @entity69 said she agrees with the report 's conclusion that @entity20 waited too long to give the order to abandon ship			1
" but at the same time i ca n't even put myself in his shoes when it comes to making that call in a hurricane , " she said			0
since the disaster @entity69 has been struggling to overcome repeated nightmares and deep - seated fears linked to the @entity9 , while working on an oil rig supply ship in the @entity102			1
the ships ' owner -- @entity109 , according to the report , " committed acts of negligence that contributed to " @entity19 's death and the presumed death of @entity20			1
@entity112 played a contributing factor in the disaster , the report said			2
the " crew was suffering from fatigue which was born out of lack of sleep , being sea sick , and from the physical exertion of fighting to save the vessel while in extreme weather conditions for over 24 hours			2
" the bounty operated as a recreational vessel under " less stringent safety standards , " the report said			2
it recommended that the @entity11 " examine if legislative , regulatory or policy changes are needed			0
" " inspections should be thorough and should take a long time , " @entity69 said			0
" i would be in favor of a higher level of training when you 're making passages			0
" but @entity69 remains protective of ships like the @entity9 that serve as training vessels for inexperienced sailors such as @entity140			2
" you 've got to keep that going , " @entity69 said			0
the @entity11 handled its investigation in a way that was both thorough and respectful of the crew , she said			2
read the full report the bounty was a movie star , a re-creation of the infamous 18th - century @entity149 navy vessel of the same name , constructed by a @entity152 shipbuilder for the 1962 @entity154 film " @entity157 , " starring @entity155 and @entity156			1
@entity19 , who was 42 , had said she was a descendant of the original @entity9 's lead mutineer , @entity160			2
more recently , the @entity9 had appeared in @entity163 's " @entity162 " movie franchise			2
but the @entity9 was never designed to sail the sea for 50 years			0
and the aging vessel had maintenance issues that would be expected of a half - century old , 180 - foot - long ship made of oak and @entity170 fir			1
did the crew have enough experience ? questioning during the @entity11 hearing frequently centered around the crew 's experience			1
the bounty was @entity19 's first job on a sailing vessel			1
in fact , 10 of @entity9 's 15 crew members had been aboard for less than a year , including two who 'd joined less than a month before its last voyage			1
@entity19 had been hired just five months before			0
life and death on the @entity9 her family remains in settlement talks in the wake of a $ 90 million civil lawsuit the @entity140 filed against the ship 's owner , the @entity192 - based @entity109 , headed by @entity193			1
@entity193 declined to testify at the @entity11 hearings , evoking his @entity196 constitutional rights against incriminating himself			0
@entity193 has repeatedly declined @entity2 requests for interviews , although he has said more than once he intended to tell his side of the story , eventually			0
on thursday , in an e-mail to @entity2 , @entity193 wrote , " i can not comment while there is pending litigation			0
" an attorney for @entity19 's family , @entity205 , said the report will help push his case toward a final resolution			1
the investigation also focused on @entity20 's decision to sail despite knowing that @entity13 was threatening to move up the @entity34			1
@entity20 set sail for @entity212 , @entity33 , from @entity213 , @entity32			0
crew members testified that @entity20 's plan was to stay east of the storm as it moved up the coast			1
but two days into the voyage , the captain diverted from his plan and ordered a course change			2
crew members testified that @entity20 wanted to pilot the ship northwest of @entity13 to harness its winds			1
turning more westerly , the boat crossed the path of the oncoming hurricane			0
the @entity9 found itself in big trouble			2
seawater leaking into the ship knocked out power to water pumps and engines , leaving the @entity9 adrift while being battered by the raging storm			2
wind gusts above 100 mph and waves as high as 30 feet flipped @entity9 on its side , tossing everyone into the predawn @entity76			0
while the crew tried to keep their heads above the towering waves , the wind slammed the ship 's mast and rigging on top of them			1
getting tangled in underwater rigging nearly drowned some crew members , who were barely able to free themselves and swim to the ship 's lifeboats			1
hours later , @entity11 rescuers were able to save 14 crew members			1
@entity19 was pulled from the water			0
she was unresponsive and could n't be revived			0
as for the captain , @entity20 's body was never found			1
shortly after @entity69 got word that the investigation report was available , she took a moment to try to read it			2
" i started to cry , " she said			0
" and i said , ' i ca n't do this			0
' " @entity69 said the release of the report has brought her emotional state back to 2012 , during the painful hours immediately following the crew 's rescue			1
officials were asking her questions			0
" i was sitting in a room and looking out the window and i remember the weather was really crappy outside and i 'm thinking , ' oh that 's right , this nightmare is still going on			2
i 'm being asked to tell this story			0
' " for some reason , @entity69 still remembers that her hair was still wet that day , as she sat in that room			0
" now , with the report coming out , i kind of feel like my hair is still wet , " she said			2
" you know what i mean ? " ' we chase hurricanes ' during the 2013 investigative hearings , @entity11 and @entity287 officials asked surviving crew members whether @entity20 believed it was acceptable to intentionally sail near hurricanes			0
as evidence , the @entity11 introduced a @entity294 video of @entity295 where he says , " we chase hurricanes			0
" in the video , @entity20 explained how to " get a good ride " out of a hurricane by sailing " as close to the eye of it as you can " and staying behind the storm in its southeast quadrant			0
without a doubt , the captain 's harshest critic at the hearing was @entity310 , one of the world 's most respected tall - ship pilots and a self - described friend of @entity20			1
captain of the @entity315 , @entity310 summed up @entity20 's actions in four words : " reckless in the extreme			1
" the @entity11 's report follows final conclutions released in february by the @entity287			2
the @entity287 determined the @entity9 tragedy was largely caused by @entity20 's " reckless decision to sail ... into the well - forecast path of @entity13			1
" @entity287 says captain shares blame for @entity327 disaster questions at the hearing pointed to the ship 's maintenance record			1
extensive repairs had been made to the @entity9 twice in the past decade , and some work had been done weeks before it sailed , according to crew testimony			0
rot infested 18 - foot wooden planks on @entity338 's forward right and left sides			1
workers replaced them and caulked cracks and gaps in the ship 's hull below the waterline			2
@entity20 was warned by the shipyard that some of the boat 's frames -- its ribs -- also contained rot , multiple witnesses testified			0
the shipyard manager testified that the captain said he 'd do the repairs later			0
but not before he chose to sail toward @entity13			2
the way @entity9 was licensed , it was n't subject to the toughest @entity11 inspections or mandatory repairs			0
the owners chose to license the ship as an uninspected passenger vessel , a classification described by experts at the hearing as a " @entity366			0
" the status allowed the @entity9 to avoid requirements reserved for higher classified ships -- including a sometimes expensive , time - consuming @entity11 hull inspection every two years			0
the ship 's classification also allowed it to hire less experienced crew to serve in officer positions			1
the ship made its money by charging admission for shipboard tours at dockside			0
under the regulations , the @entity9 required only a simple , brief @entity11 inspection that checked for obvious safety issues such as major leaks or malfunctioning emergency equipment			0
the @entity9 passed one of these about two months before the disaster			0
no safety inspections were required for the ship to go to sea because the @entity9 carried no passengers .			0
