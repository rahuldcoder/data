@entity0 -- merging magazine cutouts , painted objects and even motorbike parts , @entity6 artist @entity5 creates layered images of fantastical figures , transforming the female form into something both powerful and primal			1
famous for her collages , @entity5 has had her work shown all over the world , including her most recent exhibition at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
@entity5 's renderings challenge widespread depictions of the typical female form , creating a new kind of woman			1
her creations have sometimes been described as grotesque , but she says it does n't bother her at all			1
speaking to @entity1 's @entity25 , @entity5 said : " it means that people are looking			1
it means their senses are on when they are in front of the work , which is important			0
because for me , it 's important to think about and understand what 's in the work			1
" an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity1 : i want to start by talking about your work and its content			0
@entity5 : there are a lot of bodies in the work , there are a lot of animal bodies and organisms and women and men 's bodies and they all come together			1
they mesh up into shapes that are often female - like , and in the end i do obsess over the female form because that is the place where i want to express some of these issues i have with the way women 's bodies are written upon and women 's bodies are talked about and women 's bodies are depicted			1
so that becomes my experiment			0
my lab is this female body that becomes this vessel where i place all of this stuff in			0
@entity1 : when we look at the female form in your work what are we seeing ? @entity78 : often there 's an emphasis in my work and it 's sort of the celebrating of the body			1
i 'm very much a person that believes that there 's something that was introduced into @entity6 and @entity86 as we know it that has made us despise our bodies			1
so that 's the first thing -- i try to introduce something celebratory and interesting about the body , that the body is important			1
@entity1 : despise is a strong word -- what do you mean with that ? @entity78 : being taught to despise your body is being taught to perhaps admire someone else 's body more than yours -- being taught that your body is good for certain things and not for others			1
it 's good for labor , but it 's not ideal if someone were to sit in a political post or something			1
it belongs in a certain frame and not in others and i think that was something taught to us , given to us or forced upon us			0
@entity1 : what 's with the motorcycle parts ? because there seem to be motorcycle parts embedded in your work			2
what does that mean to you ? @entity78 : a lot of motorbikes have been built to look like women , and to feel as if you were on a woman			0
so i think that 's also what i 've been trying to sort of do is take apart this machine and implant it into these bodies and sort of give the women a kind of strength that the machine supposedly represents for the man			2
it 's like they 're taking it back and they become these cyborgs , these fierce female cyborgs			2
who knows what they 're going to do with that strength ! but for me it 's my little way of giving back the women that power that 's taken away , especially in the representations of women in these kinds of magazines because they really are the focal point and in a way that sexualizes the machines so men will buy more of them			2
@entity1 : your work has been described by some as both beautiful and grotesque , repulsive			0
does it bother you ? @entity78 : no it does n't bother me			0
it means that people are looking			0
it means their senses are on when they are in front of the work , which is important			0
for me , it 's important to think about and understand what 's in the work but i think visuals need to enter , they need to dissolve themselves into your psyche and if people start to get grossed out by something that 's not overtly gross -- i mean it 's a static image , it 's not sort of throwing itself at you -- there must be some sort of wonderful process going on in their brain , which is good			2
@entity1 : the collages , let 's talk about the form			1
i 'm fascinated by them because someone who does collages strikes me as someone who has to be slightly @entity192			2
are you obsessive ? @entity78 : very , yeah ! i am very obsessive with this actual practice and technique because it calms me down			0
it 's a meditative , calming obsession , believe it or not			2
it 's like the monotony of when you knit , there 's something about that rhythm that allows your mind to wander or at least allows for free association to happen			0
for me collages manage to , it satisfies all of my madness , like i 'm able to make these obsessive things but then i 'm also able to make these very strong statements			0
i do n't know what they mean to other people , but in my mind they have a very strong particular resonance ; there 's sort of a power			0
i 'm sort of fusing languages , which is actually a good way of talking about what @entity6 is , in fact what @entity86 is , this fusion of people and this attempt to try and create commonality amongst people who do n't come from the same place			1
so i feel that 's very alive in the work , this sort of intense desire to bring it all together .			0
