-- the first refuge of tyrants and buffoons is to blame someone else for the messes they make			1
on the world stage , that usually means blaming @entity9 when things do not go their way			1
it 's an old trick			0
it 's easy to spot			0
but it does n't work as well as it used to			0
@entity16 's @entity15 is using it to bolster his standing ahead of sunday 's presidential election			1
the @entity20 regime just dusted off the old trick in advance of friday 's election , the first national vote since the disputed , probably stolen , 2009 election			1
so have @entity25 and @entity26 , blaming " foreign conspirators " for their people 's demands for democratic change			1
even @entity32 president @entity31 , with elections approaching , has blamed his cancer on the @entity35			1
that is , indeed , a flattering collection of critics			0
the blame - @entity9 ploy is nothing new			1
the first chapter of the @entity42 instructs practitioners to find an external enemy to help them preserve their rule			0
ok , there is no such book , but the strategy is as familiar as paying " supporters " to attend a pro-government demonstration , or simply stealing an election			0
by blaming mysterious and powerful outsiders , rulers can shift their problems and distract the population from their legitimate grievances			2
and when it really works , the tactic can rally the people behind the leader as they passionately take up the cause against evil foreigners who would harm their country			2
what could be better ? the scam worked like a charm for decades in the @entity66 , where dictators blamed the @entity9 and @entity68 for their countries ' multiplying ills			1
but the search for excuses , like a knife that has been used too many times , is not cutting as sharply as it used to			2
in 2009 , when hundreds of thousands of @entity20 took to the streets accusing president @entity77 of stealing the election , the regime blamed " western powers " for the outcry			1
ahead of friday 's parliamentary elections in @entity20 , authorities first decimated the opposition and then accused @entity9 of a secret plot			1
authorities imprisoned those who dared to speak out , including reporters , and carried out scores of public executions as a way to intimidate dissenters			0
the regime still faces profound internal divisions -- between hard - liners and harder - liners			0
but it would still like a strong turnout to make its stifling grip on power look like a warm embrace			2
to pre-empt anyone from interpreting low voting numbers as rejection of the regime , the government warned that a malevolent @entity9 is afraid of a turnout and is working to keep @entity20 from voting			1
it further claimed that turnout was high when voting was just starting , despite observations to the contrary			0
in @entity25 , the @entity9 and @entity68 have been blamed for practically everything , from starting uprisings to fomenting sectarian clashes			1
the ruling military council is resisting pressure for change			0
when protesters demand democracy , the military council hints it 's @entity9 's doing , suggesting " hidden powers " are creating unrest , and then detaining @entity120 democracy workers			1
@entity25 authorities walk a fine line , seeking to benefit from anti-american sentiment without cutting off @entity126 's generous aid			1
@entity26 's @entity127 has blamed a variety of villains for his woes , as he continues to kill regime opponents by the thousands			0
he even tried to provoke fighting with @entity68 by rushing people across the border last summer , but the people saw through his scheme			0
still , the president claims , " the external conspiracy is clear to everybody			0
" in @entity16 , no one doubts that @entity15 will win sunday 's presidential election			1
he has run @entity16 for more than a dozen years , including an early stint as prime minister			1
he won the presidency twice , and when he hit the term - limit block , he anointed a successor as president while he became prime minister yet again			0
when he announced a few months ago that he would seek the presidency , @entity16 felt insulted			1
despite the merciless @entity155 cold , thousands have protested against @entity15 , because they believe his actions are an affront to democracy			0
but in utterly predictable fashion , @entity15 blames the the @entity160 took a jab at secretary of state @entity162 and dismissed his critics by accusing them of following @entity165 's " signal			0
" in a rant reminiscent of moldy @entity168 politics , he said the @entity9 wanted to weaken @entity16 , a rival nuclear power			1
@entity15 will win because he still enjoys a great deal of support , and because he has denied @entity16 a chance to fairly weigh the alternatives by undermining the opposition at every turn and monopolizing media coverage			2
his charges that the @entity9 orchestrated opposition to his rule only serve to show his nervousness and weakness			2
in @entity32 , @entity31 is facing stronger opposition than at any time in his dozen years in power			2
he too has made warnings about @entity9 misdeeds a hallmark of his rule			2
when he was diagnosed with cancer , as had been several @entity120 presidents , he suggested a mysterious @entity126 link to the illnesses			0
the search for a distraction , for someone to blame for all that ails a president or a country does not mean that outsiders are completely free of blame			2
but it does point to regimes that want to change the subject , that want the people to think about something else , anything , other than whether or not they should stay in power			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0

@entity210 : tyrants like to blame someone else for the messes they make
@entity215 : rulers in @entity16 , @entity20 , @entity25 and @entity32 have pointed *fingers* at the @entity9
she says this tactic has worked for decades in the @entity66
@entity215 : but the search for distractions is not working as well as it used to
