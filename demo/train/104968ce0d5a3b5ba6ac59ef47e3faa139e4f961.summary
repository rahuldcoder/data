the artificial breathing support for a clinically dead woman who is 18 weeks pregnant has been switched off by the @entity7 hospital treating her , an official with detail knowledge of the case said saturday			1

@entity7 's @entity44 also called the case tragic , but said the court proceedings were necessary			2
