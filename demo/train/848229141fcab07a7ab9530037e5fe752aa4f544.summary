-- @entity2 @entity1 ? by most estimations , the @entity4 show was somewhat staid this year			1
some of @entity7 ' jokes fell flat , no one got bleeped , and at one point whatever was happening on @entity11 ' phone was way more interesting than the actual show			1
but there were a few things that happened that the @entity15 has fallen in love with -- other than @entity7 's selfie , we mean			1
things like : 1 ) @entity1 , learn to pronounce @entity20 , please perhaps he is not a @entity22 fan or missed all of the hubbub about " @entity25			1
" whatever the reason , @entity1 butchered singer @entity20 's name while introducing her performance of the @entity4 - winning song " @entity30 " from " @entity25			1
" suddenly " uh - deen - a men - zelle " became " the wickedly talented " " @entity20			1
" @entity33 , what ? dude , that was n't even close			0
we expected better from someone who started his intro with " there will always be a special place in my heart for the movie musical			0
" 2 ) that pizza guy yep , that was an honest - to - goodness pizza delivery that happened during the show			2
@entity7 joked about sending out for some pies , and sure enough , a deliveryman from @entity47 's & @entity49 's @entity48 appeared			1
he did n't give his name , but word is his co-workers were cheering for him			0
" who 's your favorite movie star ? they 're here , " @entity7 quipped to him			1
of course she passed the hat ( @entity61 's , naturally ) to take up a collection for his tip , though it looks like he left without collecting it			1
the chain , which has stores throughout @entity68 , wasted no time in tweeting about the delivery , as did pregnant actress @entity70 , who @entity7 wanted to make sure got a slice			1
" @entity73 - there is gluten - free pizza ! ! ! ! " @entity75 tweeted			2
3 ) ' 12 years a slave ' beef ? kudos to @entity79 for winning the @entity4 for best adapted screenplay for " 12 years a slave			0
" but he noticeably did not thank the film 's director , @entity83			2
and @entity83 's reaction in the audience to @entity79 's win did n't look very joyous			2
actually , it appeared that at some points @entity83 's hands did n't even touch and instead there was a faux - clap			2
@entity94 journalist @entity93 tweeted that her sources were " attributing @entity79 - @entity83 cold shoulder at @entity4 tonight to dispute over screenplay credit			0
" 4 ) no love for @entity99 once again @entity100 was passed over for an @entity4 , and once again fans roared			0
@entity100 lost the best actor award to @entity103 , and many were not pleased			0
it marks the fourth snub by the @entity4 for @entity99 , who was nominated this year for " @entity108 " but has previously lost with nominations for " what 's @entity111 , " " @entity112 " and " @entity113			2
" " @entity99 you could see he is trying to hold back the tears , " tweeted one fan with a pic of what looked to be a dejected @entity99 responding to his name not being called			0
and then there was the " and this is where i 'd put my @entity4 ... if i had one " illustration of the actor			0
better luck next year ? 5 ) @entity61 comes up short ( s ) yes , it is @entity68 , where it 's sunny and warm , and maybe @entity61 was just overjoyed that the @entity4 red carpet was spared the predicted rainstorm			1
otherwise , we have no way of understanding why @entity132 showed up in shorts			0
the singer - songwriter - producer and his wife appeared on the red carpet with her in a feminized version of a tux , and him in formal wear only from the waist up			0
he may have been " happy " with his fashion choice , but many were n't			0
# @entity4 , " said one tweet			0
" @entity61 is slowly turning into a park ranger , " tweeted one viewer , who clearly was paying homage to our favorite @entity61 fashion item , his @entity150 - like hat			1
we would like to think @entity61 made up for it with his rousing performance of his song " @entity155 " from " @entity156 , " which got the crowd moving			1
after all , anyone who can get @entity160 to shimmy ca n't be all bad , right ?			0

@entity1 totally messed up the *pronunciation* of " @entity20 "
@entity7 committed to her pizza joke
@entity61 's shorts did not go over well
