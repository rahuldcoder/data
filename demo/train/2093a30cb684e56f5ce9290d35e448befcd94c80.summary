-- i 'm proud to be the honorary chair of the @entity3 happening this saturday , inspired by @entity5 's life and legacy			1
it 's the perfect way to kick off the inauguration weekend because anyone can participate , and we know that when we work together , we will achieve more than one person could on his or her own			1
president @entity15 , vice president @entity16 , members of @entity13 and their families will be rolling up their sleeves at service projects in our nation 's capital			1
but you do n't have to be in @entity22 to get involved			0
from repairing fire - damaged homes in @entity25 and cleaning sidewalks in @entity27 to spending time with children with disabilities in @entity30 , every state will offer opportunities to volunteer			1
all these projects have one big thing in common : they 're making a community , our country and our world better			0
that 's part of what makes service special			1
whether it 's volunteering time , skills , ideas or resources , we all can make a difference			1
@entity48 : a life celebrated through service when i was growing up , my parents and grandparents taught me that engaging in service , helping our neighbors and building strong communities are all part of being a good citizen and a good person			2
my grandmothers , @entity61 and @entity62 , embodied that conviction			2
they both had hard lives growing up during the @entity65 and @entity66 , but despite the obstacles they faced , they found time to volunteer at their churches and community centers and later , their kids ' schools			2
they created families full of love , support and service			2
my parents instilled their mothers ' values in me from early on			2
in @entity84 , @entity83 , we went to church on sundays , and afterward , conversation often turned to what volunteer project we could do together			2
favorites were deciding which books to donate to the church or library and cleaning up parks together , something my father always managed to turn into a game			0
when we moved to @entity22 , service remained an important part of my life			0
in high school , i helped head the service club , and in college , i volunteered as an @entity103 tutor and in the art therapy room at the @entity105 in @entity106			0
i loved talking to my grandmothers about my volunteer work , and i agreed with them : i received more than i could ever possibly give			1
some volunteer work , such as removing debris after hurricanes , is undeniably hard , physically and emotionally			1
but a lot of activities , such as chaperoning school field trips , helping a sick child make a collage , reading to older people who have lost their eyesight or participating in an @entity120 walk with friends , can be lots of fun			0
the work is also elevating and powerful			0
this saturday , as i join thousands of @entity125 coming together to do their part , i 'll be thinking about my grandmothers , just like i do every day			1
i know they 'd be proud of our country , that in cities and towns across @entity125 , people are lending their neighbors a hand , just as they taught their children and grandchildren to do			0
but as exciting as the @entity3 will be , it will be even more powerful if it is just the beginning			0
already , people are going online to pledge to make giving back a part of their lives , not just for a day or for a week , but all year round			1
if everyone who pitches in this weekend keeps up that commitment throughout the year , think about how much good we can all do			1
lots of small acts add up to big change			0
nineteen years ago , my father proudly signed the bill making @entity149 a time dedicated to serving others			0
at the speech he gave to mark the event , he reminded us of what @entity5 once called , " life 's most persistent and urgent question : what are you doing for others ? " there are countless right answers to that question -- the only wrong one is to do nothing			0
as we think about the future of our communities and our country , we each have the ability and the responsibility to participate			0
i hope you can join me , the first family and our entire @entity125 family this saturday as we make this country that we love even better			1
you can learn more , find an event near you , and pledge to serve here , at the @entity176			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			1
