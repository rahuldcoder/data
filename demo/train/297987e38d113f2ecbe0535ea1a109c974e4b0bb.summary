@entity0 -- a lawyer for @entity5 's estate gave an entertainment industry consultant permission to help @entity7 in its defense of the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the pop singer 's mother , the expert testified			1
the revelation was a surprise to @entity14 , who was sitting in court tuesday listening to the expert testify that he believed her son would not have earned any money even if he had not died of a propofol overdose			0
if jurors decide @entity7 is liable in @entity5 's death , testimony by @entity23 -- whose company billed the concert promoter $ 700,000 to prepare his opinion -- could be used to determine how much in damages the company would have to pay to @entity5 's mother and three children			1
@entity23 , however , previously consulted for the @entity5 estate in determining a value of it 's biggest asset -- the @entity37 - @entity36 music catalog that includes the @entity39 songs			1
he testified that before he signed a contract to serve as an expert in @entity7 's defense he sought and gained permission from the @entity5 estate lawyer @entity44 to waive any potential conflict of interest			1
" she ( @entity44 ) was well aware of everything that was going on , " @entity23 testified			0
a spokesman for the @entity5 estate was unaware of the circumstances or reasons why the estate would approve the waiver that could be counter to the interests of its beneficiaries -- @entity5 's mother and three children			1
bad news hurt @entity5 's earning potential , witness says an entertainment industry analyst hired by @entity5 lawyers testified he was " reasonably certain " @entity5 would have earned $ 1.5 billion from touring before retiring if he had not died while preparing for his comeback concerts in 2009			2
@entity23 testified that it was " speculative " that @entity5 would have even completed the 50 " @entity68 " concerts that @entity7 had already sold out in @entity67			2
@entity23 said that based on what he 'd learned from testimony in the case , he believed that @entity5 would have died before the first show -- even if he had not suffered the fatal overdose of a surgical anesthetic on june 25 , 2009			2
he cited the testimony of a doctor who said that @entity5 would have been dead within a week if he remained under the care of dr. @entity78			0
the @entity5 lawsuit contends @entity7 is liable in @entity5 's death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised @entity78 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the pop icon 's death			1
the @entity85 opinion included $ 300 million that he estimated @entity5 would have earned from endorsements and sponsorships			0
but @entity23 testified that " significantly negative headlines , drug abuse and other issues " had ruined @entity5 's ability to earn endorsement and sponsorship money			1
" q score " data for @entity5 , which measures his " likability , " became dramatically negative by 2006 -- a year after he was acquitted in a child molestation trial , he testified			0
more than seven people said they disliked @entity5 for every one who said they liked him , he said			0
companies would be " very anxious " about putting someone with such a negative " likability " next to their products , he said			0
@entity5 's drug use explored in trial one issue hurting @entity5 's endorsement deal potential was his financial debt , estimated to be $ 400 million at the time of his death , @entity23 said			1
but @entity5 lawyer @entity113 asked @entity23 if he considered that @entity5 's assets -- most notably the @entity37 - @entity36 catalogue -- were greater than his debts			1
@entity23 stuttered on the witness stand , saying he was reluctant to discuss @entity5 's assets because of a client confidentiality issue			2
he eventually acknowledged that he had worked for the @entity5 estate as a consultant analyzing the value of the music catalog			2
he signed a confidentiality agreement with the estate , which he said prevented him from discussing it			0
his company did , however , clear his participation in the wrongful death case with a @entity5 estate lawyer before he agreed to be an expert for @entity7 , he said			1
@entity23 also said @entity7 lawyers were aware of the potential conflict before hiring him and had no problem with it			2
wednesday is the 60th day of testimony in the trial , which began 14 weeks ago in a @entity139 court			0
the judge told jurors she expects testimony to conclude in mid-september			0
@entity143 ' bigger than @entity5 ' ?			0
