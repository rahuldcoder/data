" we really regret people trying to use this to divide blacks and @entity13 , " said @entity8 , a spokeswoman for @entity1			1
" it 's disturbing to us that @entity4 has this theory			1
the only time he apparently cares about what happens to a @entity18 is when they may have happened to kill a young @entity22 - @entity21 man			1
" in response to a caller on his radio program on tuesday , @entity4 suggested @entity1 , the largest national @entity18 civil rights and advocacy organization in the @entity21 , has not stood behind @entity27 after it was publicized that he identified himself as @entity18			1

i have n't heard a word from @entity1 about this			2
" outcry mounts ; answers sparse @entity4 went on to criticize the group 's president , @entity34 , for not referencing @entity27 as @entity18 in her sole commentary on the @entity7 incident , which was released on march 22			1
" the fact that @entity27 is @entity18 is irrelevant to his actions , " @entity38 , who is an adviser to @entity34 , said in response to the criticism			1
" personally that 's the media 's fault			0
everything has to fit into a narrative and a paradigm			0
initially it was a white guy who shot a black kid			0
now they 've split the difference , " she said			0
what the witnesses are saying " unfortunately , being @entity18 does not mean that you are n't capable of bigotry or discrimination , " @entity38 said			1
" it does not condone or preclude him ( @entity27 ) from having acted in a discriminatory manner			2
" as for why @entity1 has not been more vocal about the incident , @entity38 said behind the scenes the group has been showing its support since the beginning , despite the perceived tensions between blacks and @entity13			1
evolution of the hoodie although @entity1 has been largely out of the spotlight during the controversy , other @entity18 groups have stepped up to show their support			2
on march 20 , the @entity75 released a statement asking for the @entity77 to pursue the matter as a federal hate crime			0

" @entity1 said it supports the @entity77 decision to " rectify this situation " and said the group is waiting for " all the facts to come out " before it makes further comments			2
" we 're very supportive of accountability , " @entity38 added			0
