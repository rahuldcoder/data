-- just how awful has @entity2 dysfunction become ? @entity4 's military members and veterans -- once immune to political sniping -- are caught in the crossfire			1
last week , members of the @entity9 again engaged in their usual political games , and this time , veterans lost out on critical support			1
almost all @entity13 strongly supported the veterans @entity14 , including @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19			0
it is a transformative bill that includes critical , longstanding priorities for veterans			1
the bill would provide additional advance funding for the @entity24 , help the @entity24 end the disability claims backlog , improve health care services , strengthen the new @entity27 , support veterans hiring programs and expand survivor benefits			1
each of these provisions has garnered bipartisan support			0
but when the legislation , introduced by @entity37 chairman @entity36 , reached the @entity9 floor , @entity34 objected to the scope of the bill			1
democrats would n't allow amendments			0
republicans would n't provide the votes to move forward			0
nobody would compromise and veterans were left getting the shaft			0
the @entity9 shenanigans capped a winter of discontent for our community in which @entity2 continually attacked military members , veterans and their families			1
it used to be that vets could count on bipartisan support in @entity57			1
but clearly , no more			0
in december , @entity57 cut military retirement benefits as part of a bipartisan , backroom budget deal			1
reducing the annual cost - of - living adjustment for most military retirees and survivors would have led to a 20 % cut to retirement benefits over the course of their lives			0
for a retired @entity70 sergeant first class ( @entity71 7 ) that would have meant the loss of $ 83,000 in retirement savings			0
after massive protests and pressure from veterans and supporters , @entity57 finally reversed course and restored the benefits for veterans who served or enlisted before january 1 , 2014			1
last week , @entity57 forced the @entity81 to make budget cuts that increased living costs for our service members			1
our service members are faced with a budget that would raise their grocery prices at commissaries by at least 20 % and force military families to pay an additional 5 % out - of - pocket for housing			1
@entity0 reported that members of the military redeemed nearly $ 104 million in food stamps at commissaries in the fiscal year that ended september 30			0
the defense department budget would cut subsidies that service members use to pay for diapers for their kids and to put bread on the table			0
and then thursday the @entity9 leadership put partisanship ahead of helping veterans			2
veterans and those active in the armed forces do n't have time for this nonsense			2
@entity112 and @entity113 will be going to @entity114 next month to demand @entity57 stop the attacks and put veterans ahead of petty politics			2
@entity2 needs to do much more to support those who sacrificed for their country			0
there are many deep problems : about 22 veterans die by suicide every day			1
and according to a new study , the suicide rate for young male vets has skyrocketed , up 44 % from 2009 to 2011			2
the @entity24 disability claims backlog has hovered near 400,000 for months			2
these are veterans whose lives are on hold , waiting for the benefits they have earned			0
the unemployment rate for post- 9/11 veterans remains higher than the national average			0
@entity57 and the administration still have not truly reformed the broken military justice system , which has failed tens of thousands of survivors of military sexual assault			1
i had the honor of attending the @entity142 a month ago , when every member of @entity57 stood up to applaud sgt. 1st class @entity144 , an @entity70 ranger who was wounded in a roadside bombing in @entity148 during his 10th deployment overseas			1
the sustained , thundering applause was an incredibly moving gesture			0
but ultimately , it was just that : a gesture			0
what has @entity57 done since the @entity142 to help veterans like @entity157 who put on a uniform to defend our country ? aside from fixing its own mess on military retirement benefits , @entity57 has done nothing			1
and we 're not going to sit by idly as @entity57 fails to act on our priorities and , worse , attacks the benefits we 've earned			2
we await a spring of hope for veterans and their families			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity176 : @entity9 could n't pass bill addressing veterans ' priorities
@entity176 : @entity57 is failing military families and proposing more cuts
@entity176 : 22 vets die by suicide a day , @entity24 backlog huge , military justice is broken
he says @entity57 stood for wounded ranger , but it was only a gesture
