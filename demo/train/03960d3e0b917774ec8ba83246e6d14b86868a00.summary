-- almost exactly a year ago , @entity1 took a bold step			1
it opened up an online version of three of its most popular computer science classes to everyone around the world , for free			1
within weeks , close to 100,000 students or more were enrolled in each of these courses			2
cumulatively , tens of thousands of students completed these courses and received a statement of accomplishment from the instructor			1
this was a real course experience			0
it started on a given day , and the students would watch videos weekly and do homework assignments			0
these were real homework assignments for a real grade , with a real deadline			0
one of those classes was taught by my co-founder , @entity27			0
in his on - campus @entity1 class , he reaches 400 students a year			1
it would have taken him 250 years to reach the number of students he reached through that one online course			1
the @entity1 endeavor showed what is possible			1
it showed that it is possible to produce a high quality learning experience from some of the top instructors in the world at a very low cost			1
at the same time as this project was being run , it had become clear that changes in higher education were desperately necessary			2
a high - quality education is now a critical need for most people who aspire to a better life , while it continues to be out of reach for many			1
@entity53 : the 100,000 student classroom in many parts of the world , including large parts of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , good education is often not available because of lack of capacity			1
even in the @entity65 , where education is arguably there to be had , it may not be within reach			1
since 1985 , tuition costs have gone up 559 % , almost double the rate of the escalating costs of health care			0
this @entity1 project led to the founding in early 2012 of @entity75 , a social entrepreneurship company that hosts around 200 free courses from 33 of the world 's best universities , including @entity79 , @entity1 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and others			1
the courses span a spectrum of topics : physics , biology , computer science , engineering , medicine , literature , sociology , poetry , business and many more			1
the courses are full courses complete with short video lectures , quizzes and assignments			2
for some courses , papers or projects are assessed through a peer grading system			2
they serve a rich community of learners from all over the world , crossing geographic , ethnic and language boundaries			2
more than 1.4 million students have enrolled to take these great courses , opening new intellectual horizons as well as opportunities			0
@entity53 : let 's use video to reinvent education one of the greatest opportunities of this technology , one that is yet untapped , is the window that it opens into understanding human learning			1
the data that one can measure is unprecedented in both the level of detail and in its scale			0
thus , we can apply data analytics in entirely new ways to understand what works and what does n't , ranging from general educational strategies to specific design choices for a given course			0
this transformation from a hypothesis - driven to a data - driven mode has revolutionized other disciplines , such as biology , and may now allow us to systematically improve the quality of education			0
this paradigm , which combines meaningful work that can be graded at scale with peer - teaching among students , allows us to offer some of our best educational content to students around the world , at a negligible marginal cost of pennies per student			0
it therefore makes feasible the notion of universal education , with the potential of some remarkable consequence			0
@entity53 : teach statistics before calculus first , it allows us to establish education as a basic human right , so that anyone with the motivation and the ability would have the opportunity to get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves , their families and their communities			1
second , it enables lifelong learning			1
for many of us , learning stops when we finish our formal education			2
with the availability of these amazing courses , we would always have the opportunity to explore new directions , whether to expand our minds or to make a change in our lives			0
finally , it opens the door to a wave of innovation			0
because talent can be found everywhere			0
maybe the next @entity191 or the next @entity192 is living in some remote village in @entity59			0
with access to education , he or she can come up with the next big idea and help make the world a better place for all of us			2
as @entity205 wrote in may , " @entity202 breakthroughs happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity208 : three @entity1 computer science courses were opened to all online
she says thousands took part , showing the *hunger* for education around world
online education could *upgrade* skills , reach people who could n't afford *college* , she says
@entity208 : online education enables lifelong learning and *promotes* innovation
