@entity0 -- @entity2 covered all her bases in @entity0 on thursday : she padded her wallet with a paid speech , pitched her memoir with a book signing and fundraised for a @entity8 in a critical presidential state			1
this is becoming a familiar formula for @entity12			2
in october alone @entity12 has four trips planned -- to @entity0 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 -- where she will combine a paid speech with either a book event or a fundraiser for a @entity22 candidate or group			1
the strategy is part logistical , part practical for @entity12			2
but as she considers a presidential run in 2016 , it is also calculated			0
campaigning for @entity22 in 2014 allows her to curry favor with her party ahead of 2016 , while selling her book and speaking to paid gigs lets her raise her profile ( not that it is needed ) and toy with talking points in front of supportive audiences			0
@entity12 ended her day thursday in @entity40 at the sprawling @entity41 in @entity42 at a fundraiser for @entity44 , @entity40 's @entity45 - turned - independent - turned - @entity22 candidate for governor			1
the event was closed to the press , but according to multiple sources in the room , @entity12 both touted @entity44 as the right choice for governor and spoke about bigger picture issues like the a woman 's right to choose , growing the middle class and the importance of the space program to @entity40			1
the audience responded well to @entity12 's fundraising calls , according to those in the room , and a @entity44 campaign spokesman told @entity1 that the event raised roughly $ 1 million for the @entity8 's effort			1
the most expensive table at the event cost $ 50,000			0
@entity12 also said , according to one source , that she believed in " redemption and second chances , " a remark that was seen as an acknowledgment of @entity44 's past as a @entity45 who called on @entity12 to resign the presidency during the @entity72			1
the former secretary of state started her day , however , at the @entity75 , a white washed , swanky establishment were the @entity12 was paid to appear before 1,200 people at the @entity78			2
the event was announced in may , long before her appearance with @entity44 was announced last month			1
her speech to the women 's group focused almost exclusively on attaining an equal playing field for women in business , sports and politics			2
@entity12 called for paid leave , affordable childcare and equal pay for equal work during her speech -- all issues that would likely make up corner stones of a hypothetical presidential run			1
" i believe if we do n't dare to compete , " @entity12 told the women , " we will never know what we are capable of doing			2
" she later implored the women in the audience to take risks : " i can not tell you how important it is for women like us , all of you and me and other like us , to model that risk taking			0
to get out of our own comfort zones , to be willing to fail			0
i have done that , too , on a very large stage			0
" the crowd was receptive , with one woman holding up a sign from @entity12 's failed 2008 presidential campaign			1
" you look beautiful , " one woman screamed at the start of the speech			0
" i think it is a grandmother glow , " a loose and comfortable @entity12 retorted			2
shortly after the event , @entity12 and her relatively small traveling entourage whisked across town to @entity126 in @entity42 to sign copies of her memoir " @entity130			1
" while @entity12 's book events have become more sporadic than they were over the summer , the @entity0 event was added long after @entity12 's attendance at @entity134 was confirmed			1
over a thousand well - wishers braved the suffocating humidity and soaking rain to shake hands with @entity12 and exchange pleasantries			2
outside the event , @entity140 -- the super pac trailing @entity12 to book events -- signed supporters up			1
" looks like there are some teeth coming in , " proclaimed @entity12 when she was presented a toddler			0
" goodness you are well dressed today , " she joked to a man dressed in a blue stars and stripes sport coat			0
as for 2016 -- a question that came up a handful of times -- @entity12 dodged and laughed			0
" i 'm waiting for you to announce , i hope it will be soon , " said one woman			0
" thank you , " @entity12 responded			0
and just like that , after less than 12 hours in @entity0 , @entity12 and her entourage were back to @entity160			1
all in a days work for a women who has books to sell , money to make and @entity22 to support			0
oh yeah , and a 2016 presidential campaign to consider .			0
