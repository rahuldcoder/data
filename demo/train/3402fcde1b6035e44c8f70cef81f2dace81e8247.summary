the @entity5 kicked off @entity6 in the @entity7 with their first appearance on " the @entity9			1
" the @entity5 's subsequent globetrotting blazed a trail that , half a century later , remains worth following			1
particularly if you can avoid an overload of gratuitous @entity5 song titles along the way			2
here are some of the world 's best places to relive the original magical mystery tour			0
@entity19 , @entity20 the city where it all started has traded heavily on the @entity5 as part of efforts to transform itself from a declining industrial seaport into a tourism and cultural destination			2
obvious attractions include the well - executed @entity31 ( @entity32 , @entity33 , +44 151 709 1963 ) ; the reconstructed @entity34 ( 10 mathew st. , +44 151 236 9091 ) ; and tours that hit childhood homes and lyricized locations such as @entity38			0
these are balanced by @entity41 attractions			0
the city has impressive @entity44 and @entity45 cathedrals , the iconic ferry across the @entity47 , the @entity49 and @entity50 art galleries and the wonderful ( and free ) waterfront @entity52			0
the latter of these pays homage to the city 's maritime heritage and a musical legacy that goes far beyond @entity5			1
@entity58 , @entity59 lured by the prospect of regular paychecks , the embryonic @entity5 packed their guitar cases for @entity58 in 1960			2
here they refined their act and lineup during several seasons of relentless gigging in front of indifferent crowds in grimy nightclubs			0
fans can take tours or simply explore @entity72 , a seedy - in - places district of brothels and nightspots where the band played several venues during their time here			2
the @entity79 ( 36 @entity80 , +49 40 317 778 ) is among the most famous			0
@entity58 is a vibrant source of new , mainly electronic , music and nightlife			0
like @entity19 , it has a distinctive church , the @entity86 ( @entity87 1 , +49 40 376 780 ) and a museum exploring the city 's maritime past ( @entity92 sen. @entity91 1 , +49 40 30 092 300 )			0
@entity93 , @entity94 by 1966 the @entity5 were experimenting -- musically and pharmaceutically			1
their altered outlook took them to @entity93 , in northeast @entity94 's @entity97 foothills , to attend the ashram of @entity99 , an @entity94 guru who developed and taught transcendental meditation			1
these days the ashram , which once overlooked the @entity102 , is closed and is slowly being reclaimed by vegetation			0
but @entity93 , an important @entity105 center , remains open for business -- billing itself as @entity94 's leading destination for yoga and adventure sports , although probably not at the same time			1
proximity to @entity112 makes it a good escape from the @entity94 capital for some whitewater rafting or a stay at one of its many yoga ashrams ( among them @entity120 , +91 135 243 4301 )			1
not a precisely @entity5 experience , but in the world of transcendental meditation , close is sometimes all you get			2
@entity125 the @entity5 lived and worked at various venues in the @entity20 capital ( yes , there are tours ) , but few locations have as much of a connection with the band as @entity133 ( 3 @entity134 , near @entity136 tube station )			2
the @entity5 recorded several albums here , including 1969 's " @entity134 , " which features a hirsute @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 striding over the nearby pedestrian crossing			1
there 's no public access to the studios , which still host top music acts			0
but that has n't stopped thousands of visitors scrawling their names on the building 's boundary wall or halting traffic to recreate the famous crossing image			0
as a bonus , @entity139 still lives nearby , and sightings are n't unknown			0
@entity156 newlyweds @entity138 and @entity158 began their 1969 honeymoon with a highly publicized " bed - in " at the @entity161 ( @entity162 138 , +31 710 6000 ) , where they invited the press into their room to promote " bed peace " and " hair peace			1
" the room is now known as the " @entity170 and @entity158 suite " and can be reserved by guests			1
the couple wound up in the @entity174 capital after their own mini-tour of @entity177			0
they 'd tried to marry on a ferry across the @entity180 ( @entity181 run a regular service , but still no weddings ) before succeeding in @entity184 -- a fact the @entity187 territory continues to celebrate thanks to the number of international weddings it now hosts			0
@entity192 , @entity193 after @entity156 , @entity170 and @entity158 zipped down to @entity194 for another peace - based press conference , this time in the city 's luxury @entity197 ( @entity200 4 , +43 1 514 560 ) -- until then famous only for giving the world a preposterously rich chocolate cake			1
this was n't @entity193 's first brush with the @entity5			1
in 1965 , the band decamped to the charming central @entity193 ski resort of @entity207 to film snow scenes for their movie " help ! " the band stayed at the @entity210 , the modern incarnation ( @entity212 merstrasse 75 , +43 6456 7245 ) of which avoids any mention of the @entity5 on its website , although it does depict them in what appears to be the men 's toilets			1
@entity218 @entity138 had wanted to take his bed - in to @entity218 , but was prevented from setting foot in the @entity7 at the time due to a previous conviction for cannabis possession			1
he and the @entity5 , however , paid several other significant visits to the city			2
first there was the historic february 9 , 1964 , television appearance at the now - named @entity227 ( 1697 @entity228 , +1 212 975 4755 )			0
more history was made several days later when @entity5 became the first rock band ever to play @entity231 ( 881 7th ave. , +1 212 247 7800 )			2
the band returned to play @entity218 the following august , but that trip was eclipsed a year later when they performed at @entity234 in @entity235			2
this is believed to be rock and pop music 's first - ever stadium gig			2
@entity234 was torn down in 2008 to provide parking space for the @entity242 ' new @entity241 ( 123 - 01 @entity243 , +1 718 507 6387 ) , but there are plenty other @entity246 attractions nearby , particularly the space age relics of two @entity248 ( @entity249 , +1 718 760 6565 )			0
@entity138 , of course , later lived and was killed in @entity218 outside his residence at the @entity252 ( corner of @entity254 and @entity255 in @entity256 )			1
along with the @entity252 , the adjacent @entity257 ( near @entity255 between 71st and 74th @entity258 ) is a 2.5 - acre area of @entity255 that pays homage to @entity138			1
the @entity261 another double - hit destination for @entity138 , who flew here with @entity158 on the next stage of his bed tour , but swiftly left after checking into the @entity266 in @entity267 ( now unlisted ) , reportedly declaring : " we ca n't do a bloody bed - in here			1
let 's go to @entity271			0
" more successful was @entity138 's 1965 visit to the islands with the other @entity5 , again to film scenes for " help ! " the band stayed at the @entity277 , a hotel on @entity280 's @entity279 now renamed the @entity281 ( @entity282 , @entity280 , +1 242 327 6400 )			1
they filmed scenes on @entity285 , now home to the @entity288 resort ( +1 888 - 877 7525 ) , and @entity289 , an uninhabited private island popular for day trips and wedding parties			2
@entity292 and so , at last , to @entity170 and @entity158 's final bed - in venue : the queen elizabeth hotel in @entity292 ( 900 @entity295 , +1 866 540 4483 )			1
here the couple commandeered four rooms and invited friends including lsd fan @entity299 and beat poet @entity300 to join them recording " @entity301			0
" according to the hotel 's website , @entity138 has since been followed to the @entity304 by other sometime peaceniks , including @entity306 , @entity7 president @entity307 , @entity309 leader @entity308 and the @entity310			1
@entity311 , @entity312 ok , the @entity5 never actually visited this tank - producing @entity312 city east of the @entity315 , but that did n't stop the citizens of @entity311 taking the @entity5 to their hearts			1
even though few in the @entity309 were able to buy or listen to @entity5 songs at the height of the @entity323 , many drew inspiration from a band that was later credited with hastening the demise of communist rule -- even if their classic " @entity331 " was more about girls than politics			0
post-soviet @entity311 has repaid the favor by changing the name of a street from @entity336 to @entity138			1
lately , however , @entity311 is obsessed with a new star -- or falling star , in the shape of the huge meteorite which smashed into the region last year			0
reports say the city hopes thousands of tourists will be attracted by this asteroid from -- sorry , it ca n't be helped -- " @entity347			0
" @entity348 is a freelance journalist based in @entity125 .			0

from @entity94 to the @entity261 , @entity5 *pilgrimages* remain popular
at the @entity161 you can stay in @entity170 and @entity158 's " bed - in " room
@entity311 , @entity312 , changed the name of a street from @entity336 to @entity138
@entity257 in @entity218 's @entity255 is a *poignant* spot for @entity5 fans
