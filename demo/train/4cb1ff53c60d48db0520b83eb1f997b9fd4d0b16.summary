-- the best way to get tongues wagging is to say nothing at all , and it 's a skill @entity4 has down to a science			1
@entity4 apparently revealed the release date for her new album over @entity8			1
the @entity10 songstress arrived a bit late to the @entity8 party when she -- or her people -- created a " rihanna " tag yesterday and sent out a single , sparse tweet : " @entity17			2
" whether that 's the name of a new single , the beginning of a viral marketing campaign -- or both -- is unknown , but a representative for @entity4 told @entity24 that though the date " looks accurate " for her album release , " @entity17 " is not the album title			1
the only other object fans can mine for clues about the singer 's upcoming release is the logo , a metallic nail fashioned into a crudely shaped " r " that has swarmed the @entity36			2
the new record would be her fourth since her debut at 17			0
in the four years since , she 's evolved from an unknown , breezy pop singer to a sonically and fashionably more distinct persona			0
one can only expect that her latest effort would continue to show that growth			2
yet there are extra layers of anticipation surrounding the unnamed work : not only is this @entity4 's follow - up to " @entity51 , " the album that made her an international superstar , it 's also the first time she is piping up as a solo artist since the infamous fight with her ex-boyfriend , @entity56 , in february			1
those who 've worked with the star on the record have said to expect something with more ferocity			2
" expect an edgier , almost angrier @entity4 on this one , " @entity62 told @entity63 online			1
" @entity4 says some things on this album that you 've never heard her say before			1
" but , said @entity68 , associate editor for @entity69 , that statement should n't be taken too literally			0
" she has changed a bit , but i think she 's simply grown			0
fans are expecting her to reveal some details , but i think she 's going to subliminally let it be known that ' yes , [ @entity56 ] hurt me , but i 'm moving forward with life			1
' this issue was such a serious issue , it calls for more than putting out an angry song about it			0
" @entity78 , who said she 's been a fan of the singer since the beginning , has high expectations for the upcoming release , but not because she expects to hear about @entity4 's personal life			1
" [ some fans ] feel like it would be good for her to represent abused women in some sort of way and say something , but in my perspective , she does n't owe us anything , " @entity78 said			1
" she 's always been pretty private about the relationship , and she 's never opened a lot in her music anyway			0
" if @entity4 maintains her silence , @entity78 said , it will be " kind of a hit back at the critics who said she disappeared after not becoming the spokesperson for domestic abuse			2
she 's saying this is what you should be paying attention to : i 'm a fashion icon , and i make great music			0
" @entity78 , co-founder and editor of celebrity web site @entity112 , has paid close attention to @entity4 's reported studio time over the past few months , but said he did n't expect to see the album appear so soon -- and with a tweet , no less			1
" i 'm definitely expecting more for this album , " she said			0
" @entity4 has a platform now that she did n't have before ' @entity51			1
' she 's gone a step forward with each album , and i think it 's going to be a little more of what we heard on ' @entity51 , ' but to the next level			0
" that 's a prediction that @entity68 agrees with , considering that the people who have been pulled in on this album resemble the team who worked on " good girl " : @entity132 , @entity62 and @entity133 , who was behind the single " @entity134 " that launched @entity4 to a new level of pop stardom			1
@entity137 , editor of @entity138 , said @entity133 is n't trying to top the success of " @entity134 , " but rather create a sound that would live up to its success			0
" just from hearing ' @entity143 ' we can see the direction she 's heading in , " @entity137 said			0
" it 's going to be darker and more edgy			0
she was actually going to put that song on this album , and then @entity150 heard it and they traded songs			0
" still , @entity137 said , " dark " and " edgy " do n't always equal " personal			2
" " she 's all about the music and the sound -- i think we 're going to get something that embodies her fashion sense , " he said			0
" i do n't think there 's going to be much about the @entity56 situation ; i do n't even think her fans expect that			1
they just want something that pushes the boundaries			0
" @entity4 's former other half , @entity56 , has been busying in the studio as well			1
the singer , who was sentenced to five years ' probation and more than 1,400 hours of community service in august , released the single " @entity174 " with @entity175 and @entity176 a few weeks ago , but it 's not the only one circulating the @entity36			0
" @entity178 , " a ballad with lyrics that sound suspiciously autobiographical , was leaked onto the @entity36 yesterday , as @entity56 's @entity8 page confirms			2
nonetheless , the artist does plan to keep it on the upcoming album " graffiti , " which has an undetermined release date .			1

@entity188 tweet from @entity4 appears to reveal new album release date
@entity192 would be the first since fight with @entity56 in february
