-- @entity1 is on a one - woman whirlwind campaign to change the way kids eat in schools			1
" we 're killing our kids with food , " she says			1
@entity1 sees her work transforming school lunch programs as a way to leave a lasting impact			1
half of all the @entity16 and @entity18 - @entity17 kids born in 2000 and one - third of @entity20 kids will have diabetes in their lifetime , many before they graduate college , @entity13 says , citing @entity17 @entity24 statistics			1
" it 's all because of what we are feeding them , " she says			1
" it 's all preventable			1
" @entity13 , self - proclaimed renegade lunch lady and chef , is actively working against what she describes as entrenched interests -- fast - food companies and junk - food producers -- that she says profit from selling unhealthy foods to schools			1
they 're " basically making money off our children 's health and their future , " she says			1
" i 'm just so pissed off			2
" she was n't always this way			2
@entity13 used to be a big - shot celebrity chef who worked at tony resorts , on cruise ships , for hotel chains and prestigious film festivals			1
she 's won numerous awards and is on boards for executive chefs , women chefs and the @entity56 of the @entity57			2
despite the accolades , @entity13 felt something was missing			0
she recognized that as a celebrity chef , she was reaching only the top 10 percent of the wealthiest people in the country			2
so she sought ways to make a difference			0
she and her fellow culinary icons " would spend a lot of time trying to give back , " she says			0
" we cooked for @entity70 , we cooked for donations , we cooked whatever			0
" but there was also impermanence to food			0
whether people ate her food or threw it away , @entity13 lamented that it all ended up as sewage or waste			0
after writing her first book , " a woman 's @entity87 , " on the role of women in food , she started to feel like there was a way to leave something behind			2
writing the book led to associations with high - profile women who were trying to make a difference -- @entity97 from @entity98 , @entity99 , and @entity100 of @entity101 , who were into organics and sustainability			1
those relationships changed the way she thought about food -- so much so that a few years later came her second book , " @entity108 , " about where our food supply comes from and how political concerns often trump healthy diets			0
now @entity13 knew she was getting somewhere			0
when the @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 , called offering her a position as executive chef of wellness and nutrition , she did n't exactly jump at the chance			1
but after giving it some thought , she realized it was a way to reach future generations and really leave a lasting impact			0
" all of a sudden , it felt like , wow , this is something i could really do , and i could really make a difference			0
" today , @entity13 is director of nutrition services in @entity98 , where she has transformed the school lunch program from 90 percent frozen reheated foods to 90 percent fresh			1
@entity98 schools used to serve fruit once a week ; now it 's on the menu every day , and so is the salad bar			1
more than that , the healthy food curriculum is carried into the classroom			0
with a staff of 90 to help , @entity13 runs cooking classes , gardening classes and serves food in 17 locations			0
she has created a " meal wheel " to help kids all over the country understand what should be on their plates daily			1
with her web page , @entity153 , @entity13 is hoping to make her program a model			0
" there 's only one of me			2
i ca n't cover the whole country , " she says			0
if she had one wish , @entity13 says , it would be that " @entity162 would take on this issue as a social justice issue and that we would get our presidential candidates to really start to talk about this issue , because i just ca n't imagine what 's more important ... than the next generation			2
we 're just really not taking care of them			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity174 is a senior producer in @entity0 's @entity175 , @entity176 , bureau .			2
