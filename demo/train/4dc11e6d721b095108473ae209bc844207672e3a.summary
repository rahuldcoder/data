@entity0 -- @entity2 -- the law that refuses to die -- is suddenly under attack again			1
republicans will take full control of @entity6 in january and repealing @entity2 will almost certainly be one of their first priorities			1
the @entity9 is seizing on leaked tapes in which @entity12 professor @entity11 , an architect of the law , said the " stupidity of the @entity18 voter " and a " lack of transparency " were vital to its passage in 2010			1
and , perhaps most importantly , the @entity21 is poised to rule on subsidies that are central to the law			1
" we have to take it very seriously			2
it is hard to predict how the @entity21 will ultimately decide , " said @entity26 , executive director of @entity27 , an advocacy group that campaigns to sustain @entity2			1
it 's a surprising turn of events for an issue that had seemed to move to the back burner in recent months			1
the law has already survived one key @entity21 challenge and millions are now insured because of the legislation			1
and the issue , which was expected to dominate this year 's elections , took a back seat to fears about @entity41 and @entity42			1
the next round of open enrollment for @entity2 begins saturday			0
the @entity21 poses the gravest threat after agreeing to hear a challenge to the crucial tax credits that subsidize health coverage purchased on federal exchanges			1
in what amounts to a tussle over language , the suit contends that the law permits subsidies to be dispersed only through state exchanges			1
but 35 states rely on federal exchanges to market health insurance — in many cases because @entity9 governors who oppose @entity2 refused to set up marketplaces			0
to reach consumers in those states , the federal government offers a market place and subsidies			0
but if the @entity21 rules next year that those federal subsidies are illegal , it could throw the entire health care system into chaos , threaten millions of health plans and send the entire law into a " death spiral			1
" chief justice @entity76 , who outraged conservatives by saving @entity2 from a previous @entity21 challenge in 2012 , may again be the crucial swing vote			1
but there is a chance that even an adverse ruling would not end @entity2 's life			1
@entity85 professor @entity84 says some states , to protect themselves against possible health care chaos , might finally decide to set up their own arrangements or partner with the federal exchange			0
" the prospect of that disruption is sufficiently problematic that i would not be surprised to see a lot of states adopt exchanges , " said @entity84 , who authored a book on the original @entity93 case			0
@entity2 also faces a political assault from resurgent @entity9 devoted to the mantra : " repeal and replace			1
" because so many party candidates vowed to eliminate the law during their election campaigns , @entity9 leaders in the @entity103 and the @entity104 are under pressure to schedule votes to do just that			1
but the votes will be largely symbolic			0
though they captured the @entity104 , @entity9 are still short of the 60 votes needed to overcome @entity114 filibusters			0
and even if they did put a repeal bill on the president 's desk , there is zero chance he would sign it and destroy his own proudest political achievement			1
so , as a fallback plan , opponents of @entity2 will likely try to tear it down bit by bit , possibly by attaching bills amending it to must - pass legislation			0
@entity133 and @entity135 sen. @entity134 are teaming up to produce a plan to " deliver quality affordable health care coverage to @entity18 families , " a spokesman for the @entity132 lawmaker told @entity1			0
@entity141 @entity140 sen. @entity140 has a market based health care plan he wrote with @entity145 @entity144 and @entity146			0
" conservatives should ... take advantage of opportunities to repeal any part of the law and replace it with better policies that empower @entity18 , not @entity0 , " @entity140 wrote in @entity147 on wednesday			1
@entity155 @entity9 sen. @entity154 , an orthopedic surgeon and health policy expert , warns @entity9 hopes of repealing @entity2 are not realistic until there is a @entity9 in the @entity103 but told @entity159 last month conservatives should " systematically strip away the worst parts of @entity2			0
" but some conservatives want a more radical approach , and recommend repealing @entity2 by using the budget tool reconciliation , which requires only 51 votes — and , ironically , was used to pass the law in 2010			2
but again , @entity167 would be ready with this veto pen			1
some adjustments to the law could draw some @entity114 support			2
they could include a repeal of the delayed employer mandate requiring large firms to provide health care and changes to rules requiring companies to provide insurance to employees that work more than 30 hours a week			2
some @entity114 senators from red states are eying a repeal of the tax on medical devices , which raises $ 29 billion over the next decade to finance the cost of insuring more @entity18			2
but conservatives might be end up frustrated because none of the fixes that have a chance of becoming law will seriously undermine @entity2 as a whole			2
" the parts you could chip away out probably are not going to destabilize the legislation			0
it gets through with a few bits knocked off — but it is still there , " said @entity198 , a health care expert and senior @entity201 fellow			0
@entity9 lawmakers determined to kill @entity2 may also find themselves under pressure from the corporate health firms which have spent millions of dollars adapting to the new law are are worried about more disruption			2
but @entity2 's capacity to ignite controversy is undimmed			2
@entity211 senate minority leader @entity211 could n't keep a smile off his face on thursday when discussing the leaked @entity11 tape			0
" what this insider is saying confirms that they were spinning tales from the beginning — that they did not tell the truth about @entity2 , " @entity215 said			0
house speaker @entity224 's office said @entity11 's comments proved @entity2 was rammed through @entity6 with " arrogance , duplicity and contempt for the will of the @entity18 people			2
" a test also awaits on saturday with the debut of the second open enrollment period for @entity234 , with advocates desperate to avoid website and other teething problems of last year			0
the @entity103 is backing efforts , which include mobile apps and targeted social media advertising , to recruit more " young and invincibles " — people who are least likely to sign up for coverage but who are needed to offset older , sicker patients to make the system work			0
the number of sign - ups in the three month enrollment period are likely to play an important role in the political debate going forward			0
federal officials last week projected that between nine and 9.9 million people would be signed up to @entity2 in 2015 , lower than the 13 million number previously projected by the @entity256 .			0
