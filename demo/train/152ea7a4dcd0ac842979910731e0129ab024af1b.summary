@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 has started talks with representatives of the @entity6 , a move that analyst @entity8 says could bring an end to the nine - year - long war			1
@entity2 convened a meeting thursday with the @entity12 , which was formed to help negotiate with the @entity6			1
referring to the militants , @entity2 said , " i call on them once again to use this opportunity and say ' yes ' to this endeavor			1
i want them to come and bring peace to this land			0
" the author and host of @entity1 's " @entity22 " spoke to @entity1 on thursday			0
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : @entity2 has launched a council to help negotiate with the @entity6 ? what 's the significance of that step ? @entity8 : i think it 's about time			1
if you look at any good study of civil wars , what you find is that most of them end in a negotiated settlement			1
maybe because @entity38 have the memory of our civil war in which the @entity41 crushes the @entity42 , we somehow think that that 's how civil wars end			1
but that 's actually is very unusual			0
watch an excerpt from @entity48 's interview with @entity2 what normally happens is some kind of settlement that is negotiated in which the losers are reintegrated into the political order			1
civil wars are unlike normal wars , because the winners and losers are going to have to live with one another			0
@entity1 : how does that apply to @entity3 ? @entity8 : the @entity6 , which is mounting this insurgency , is not a foreign element within the body politic			1
the @entity6 is basically the political representative of the conservative elements of the @entity66 community			1
the @entity66 are 50 percent of @entity3			1
... it is a political force in @entity3			1
coming to terms with it politically and seeing if there 's some way it can be reintegrated into the political order makes sense			0
you 're not going to kill every member of the @entity6			1
they 're not going to be exiled to a foreign land			0
they 're going to be there at the end of the day so it 's better to to have them in the tent			2
@entity1 : the @entity38 military view seems to be that the talks have n't yielded progress so far , and a senior defense official told @entity1 , " we do n't think the @entity6 believe that they 're losing to the degree that they 'd come to terms in large numbers			1
" are the talks premature because the effects of the @entity38 military buildup have n't been felt yet ? @entity8 : first the very fact that the @entity6 are coming to the table in a way they had not been willing to before suggests that they are feeling some pressure			1
but i also think you ca n't get too hung up with this idea that you have to negotiate from a position of strength			0
ideally we would have them totally prostrate on the floor and that would be the time to negotiate			0
but the reality is that this is a very mixed military campaign			0
i do n't know if it 's going to be dramatically better one year from now or three years from now			2
see more opinion articles this is a little like somebody who owns a stock , who says , it 's at six now , i need to sell it , but i 'm going to wait till it goes to eight			0
well maybe it will go to eight , maybe it will go to four			0
you might as well start talking at this point			2
first of all you learn a lot in the process of negotiations			0
and secondly , the military campaign could move in many different directions			0
if the surge starts succeeding even more , that will be reflected in our negotiating posture			0
@entity1 : is there an idea yet of what a negotiated settlement might involve ? @entity8 : it seems as though the @entity6 demands are that they want all foreign troops out			1
they do n't want to accept the @entity3 constitution and they do n't want to lay down their arms			2
now those are obviously their opening demands			0
foreign troops are n't going to be out , but one could point out that president @entity145 has said there is going to be a reduction of foreign forces next year			2
on the @entity3 constitution , there is a compromise there where there could be a few amendments to the constitution			1
but on laying down their arms , that it seems to me you ca n't really compromise , they would have to lay down their arms			0
could some elements be integrated into the militia , or the @entity3 national army ? perhaps -- that 's what happened in @entity164			2
@entity1 : is n't there also a clashing conception of society , with the @entity6 being a closed society that does n't recognize an elevated role for women as opposed to a potentially democratic kind of society that 's envisioned by the @entity3 constitution ? @entity8 : yes , it is the kind of society envisioned by the @entity3 constitution			1
but @entity3 is a fairly conservative society			2
while the extreme elements of the @entity6 have draconian visions which are obviously not supported by the @entity3 -- the polls bear this out -- it 's also true that on issues of women 's rights and some of the more progressive elements of the @entity3 constitution , the @entity2 government is in a minority and those rights are not popularly supported			1
there are clashing visions , but there is probably a reality of @entity3 which is a lot more progressive and open than the @entity6 believe but is still a society that is somewhat conservative , and often tribal , and with very traditional views on something like women 's rights			1
the key is creating a situation where these rights are guaranteed but not fetishizing it			0
for example , one of the things the @entity3 constitution has is a requirement for 25 percent representation of women in parliament			2
we do n't have such a requirement either in the @entity207 or in the amendments			0
many @entity210 countries do n't			0
is it conceivable that something like that could be compromised ? perhaps , and that 's the kind of thing where we 'd have to be creative in coming up with a solution that moderates and some elements of the @entity6 could live with			2
@entity1 : is this an honorable exit for the @entity38 ? @entity8 : i think so , and it 's not really an exit , it 's a reduction in our forces and in our role			1
and i think it would be appropriate			0
we 've been there for nine years			0
it 's not the only battleground , the only place where @entity233 operates			0
there are many more members of @entity233 in @entity236 than in @entity3			2
you 're trying to create a political settlement , and a self - sustaining political framework in @entity3 that can survive the departure of @entity38 troops			1
and finally you 're leaving enough troops in there where you could still prosecute a fairly vigorous counterterrorism operation against those elements of the @entity6 or @entity233 that continue to plot and plan to do violence to civilians , foreigners , westerners			2
and i do think , if we could get this kind of a settlement , it would be an honorable way for the @entity38 to begin reducing its exposure in @entity3 .			1
