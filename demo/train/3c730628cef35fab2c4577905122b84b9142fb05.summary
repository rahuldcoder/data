-- on most mornings , my better half wakes up around 5:30 , throws on some sweats and heads to the gym before work			0
about a half hour later , i wake up my 13 - year - old son , go downstairs to the kitchen to make his breakfast and pack his lunch			1
once he 's out the door , i brew some coffee and get to work			1
ladies and gentlemen , may i present to you the " gay lifestyle " -- run for your heterosexual lives			1
i understand opponents of gay rights must highlight differences in order to maintain the " us against them " tension that 's paramount to their arguments			1
but this notion that sexual orientation comes with a different and pre-ordained way of life -- as if we 're all ordering the no. 3 at a drive thru -- only highlights how irrational groups such as @entity35 , the @entity36 , the @entity37 and others like them are in this whole debate			0
pro-marriage organizations try to stop two consenting adults from marrying			0
pro-family groups try to stop stable couples wanting children from adopting unloved orphans			0
and somehow , me doing something like going to the grocery store threatens the very fabric of society , as @entity52 rep. @entity51 spewed			1
she says " the homosexual agenda is destroying this nation " and " homosexuality is more of a threat than terrorism			0
" i 'm not sure what her idea of a gay lifestyle might be , but with a growing teenager , buying and cooking food dominates my day - to - day			1
i do n't worship @entity63 , i do n't watch any tv show with the word " @entity67 " in its title and i love fishing , beer and @entity70			0
but more important , i 'm just a father trying to keep my son away from drugs , get him into college and have a little money left over for retirement			1
i 'm no sociologist but i 'm pretty sure those concerns are not exclusive to gay people			2
in one of the most pivotal scenes in the biopic " milk , " @entity78 , played by @entity79 , gathers a group of community organizers and activists to come up with strategies to combat a 1978 ballot initiative that sought to ban @entity89 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) teachers and their supporters from working in public schools in @entity96			2
as the small crowd settles down , @entity78 quickly glances around the room and says			0
. " if we 're going to convince the 90 percent to give a --- - about us 10 percent , we have to let them know who we are ... " " what " we are -- be it gay , straight , black , white -- is simply window dressing			2
" who " we are is where the substance is , where the person is , where our humanity is			0
too often , discussions about gay people and gay rights focus on sex , as if a person 's entire being is defined by his or her @entity119 crush			1
this fixation has been the crux behind attempts to link gay men to pedophilia -- from @entity126 , a state legislator from @entity127 who introduced the proposed ban on gay teachers in @entity96 , to the @entity131 's @entity130 , whose recent attempts to excuse the church for its global scandal coverup by seemingly blaming homosexuality -- and it 's a tactic that is evil incarnate			1
" the vast majority of the victims are post-pubescent , " @entity130 recently said on " @entity140			0
" " that 's not pedophilia , buddy			1
" actually , @entity130 , sexual predators whose victims are 13 - to 17 - years - old are called hebephiles -- a la @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 -- not homosexuals			0
and that still does n't explain why the church opted to save face as opposed to , in the words of the infamous anti-gay figurehead @entity157 , " save our children			0
" being gay does n't dictate how people live their lives any more than being straight does			2
there are gay people who go to church every sunday and straight people who do not believe in @entity165			2
there are single gay men who believe in the sanctity of marriage and married straight men who apparently do not -- such as gov. @entity171 , ex- sen. @entity172 and sen. @entity173 , to name a few			1
the truth is the only thing all gay people have in common -- you know , besides being gay -- is that we face continuous rhetorical , social and legal attacks for simply existing , thus potentially making something as mundane as bringing a date to a work function a fight - or - flee situation			2
and yet , even in the face of that discrimination , @entity89 people all handle it differently			0
some of us live in the closet , some of us do drag every wednesday night , some of us are republicans hoping to be change agents within a conservative sect and some of us are apathetic @entity194 too dumb to carry on a conversation about anything other than @entity197			0
in other words , we 're just as diverse , intolerant , upstanding and tragic as our straight counterparts and unless there is an annual meeting i do n't know about , the only item on the much talked - about gay agenda is an abbreviated passage from the @entity206 -- " we hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal			1
" in 29 states , people can be fired simply for being gay regardless of their education , experience or job performance ; servicemen and women can be dismissed from the military regardless of their qualifications , dedication and courage ; and partners are unable to see their better halves in the hospital regardless of the love , commitment and life they share			2
wanting to be judged by the content of one 's character is n't a special right , it 's a constitutional one guaranteed by the 14th and 15th amendments			1
and yet , 145 years since the abolition of slavery , 90 years since women were allowed to vote and 20 years since the @entity237 , we 're still involved in @entity239 - like investigations , holding @entity126 - like elections and taking opinion polls based solely upon " what " someone is as opposed to " who " they are			0
we 're such a great nation , still full of great hope and promise and yet we keep being tripped up by ignorance , which leads to fear and then eventually hate			2
being gay is n't a choice , but being a bigot certainly is			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity256 .			1

@entity256 : is grocery shopping , getting my son off to school the " gay lifestyle " ?
@entity256 : *nonexistent* gay lifestyle keeps up an " us against them " tension
gay rights foes drum up the fear of a link between gay men and pedophilia , he says
he writes : being judged by the content of one 's character is a constitutional right
