, then suggested i do a story on this outrageous barroom development			0
for a person whose alcohol taste buds are n't refined enough to detect the difference between @entity19 and @entity20 , the term slung about by high - minded marketers seems like just another way to suggest 1 ) intimidating cocktail menus and 2 ) staggering prices			1
it might not even be a real word			0
type " mixologist " into your laptop and you 'll see that red squiggly snake beneath it , suggesting that the word does n't even officially exist			2
my initial attempt to get to the bottom of the mixologist / bartender question only confuses things further			1
at @entity42 , @entity39 's annual masters of @entity41 event , i speak with three talented international bartenders			0
despite the name of the event they 're a part of , each dismisses the term mixologist like it 's stale beer			1
" i feel very strongly to refer to myself as a bartender , " says @entity51 @entity50			1
from dive bars to nightclubs to high - end bars , @entity53 has been pouring drinks for 11 years			2
in addition to helming @entity60 in @entity51 , she runs a cocktail consulting business , crafting creative cocktail menus for bars			1
" i do n't think mixologist is a bad term and it does say something nice about creating recipes , but it 's more important , relatively , to be welcoming and fun with your guests than to be technically perfect , " she tells me			1
" bartender trumps mixologist " in @entity76 , experienced bartenders tend to consider " mixologist " a gimmicky title employed by green bartenders			1
" in @entity84 , bartenders are the ones who make tasty cocktails while mixologists make beautiful ones , " says @entity80 , owner of @entity81 in @entity82			0
@entity80 was the @entity90 of the year runner - up for 2010 for his work at the @entity93 at the @entity94 , @entity82 ; he 's known for infusing food ingredients into his cocktails			0
" bartender trumps mixologist , " he insists			2
" younger bartenders like to call themselves mixologists nowadays , trying to make their work sound magical , " adds @entity99 , a 20 - year veteran of the trade , award - winning bartender at the elegant @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 , and considered one of the top bartenders in the country			2
" in @entity104 , people are respected for being in one job for many years , so calling yourself a mixologist does n't make your customers believe in you			0
" @entity99 's remarks suggest a generational divide , but it turns out the term " bartender " does n't have to equate to old - fashioned tapster			2
@entity99 makes me an unforgettable @entity121 using ume - shu and shiso powder			0
it 's impossible not to trust someone who " sees making cocktails as a ceremony			0
" so far everything i 've found makes the case for mixologist being a dirty word			0
that might bring a smug smile to my editor 's face			0
but i know there are plenty of people out there who use the term in a serious and meaningful way			0
mixologist actually a classic term somebody has to have a kind word for mixologists			2
i keep digging , pestering every drink pourer i can find			0
@entity149 and @entity150 both refer to themselves as " bartender before a mixologist , " but neither considers mixologist a snobbish term			1
" the term dates as far back as the 1850s , so i think to dismiss it entirely would be forsaking the rich history of our craft , " says @entity156 , founding bartender at 28 hongkong street in @entity158 and former vice president of the @entity160 of the @entity162 @entity161 ( he relocated from @entity163 to @entity158 )			1
@entity156 's 28 @entity170 ranked 10th on the @entity173 's @entity172 list in 2013 and is nominated as a finalist this year			0
" @entity143 has sprung up again over the last decade more aggressively , " says @entity150 , a @entity175 and veteran bartender in @entity51			1
" many aspiring bartenders in this modern age have used the title to gain more press and assist in transforming the consumer idea of what a bartender was and perhaps now might be			0
" the media absolutely love the term and use it more than bartenders these days to educate their readership on the evolution of the cocktail industry , " says @entity150			2
" it 's become a hype generator , its greatest proponent being marketers			0
" in recent years , the term has been abused just as ' punk rock ' became a commodity in the ' 90s			0
a ' mixologist ' is just a person with a whole lot of passion for what they do , " says @entity156			0
well , that sounded like a familiar refrain -- blame the media ! maybe my professional brethren are sometimes suckers for the hype machine , but surely the entire media ca n't shoulder the blame for the proliferation of mixologists ? where did the term come from before media and marketers went nuts for it ? " @entity220 , " says @entity150			1
the man who started it all " i 'm afraid i have to take the rap for reviving the 19th - century term mixologist , " says @entity220 , after i reach out for a so - it 's - you conversation			1
founder of the @entity229 in @entity230 and creator of his own bitters , it was 1987 when @entity220 slipped the term into the cocktail menu at the @entity235 in @entity51			1
this was at a time when the bar was creating a storm by employing classic recipes and making drinks with real ingredients and fresh juice			2
" it was clear that we were doing something no one else was doing and something that had n't been done for many years , " says @entity220			2
" i wanted to shine a light on what we were doing at @entity235 ... so i decided to call myself a master mixologist to the press			0
" a dead word in modern dictionary , he came across the term in a 19th - century bar manual while doing cocktail research			2
" it 's understandable why ' mixologist ' has become a popular moniker ; it helps to differentiate the average beer / shot / @entity264 bartender from ones who spend their time furthering their knowledge of flavor compounds and the obscure history of the craft , " says @entity156			1
" for me , the term mixologist lends to the idea of crafting creative cocktails , with a heightened understanding of the ingredients within , as potentially opposed to otherwise , " says @entity150			1
ultimately , argue its proponents , the title does n't have to denote extravagance			0
" the idea of creating great drinks is not reserved for anyone in particular and can be presented by way of relatively modest pricing , " says @entity150 , citing the populist cocktail scene in @entity51 as an example			1
" one of the things i love most about @entity51 cocktail bars is that many are operated by amazingly talented people who are modest and happy to educate their customers			1
" final verdict although most bartenders i speak with do n't despise the term itself -- rather they wince at the abuse of it -- i think it 's best to leave the verdict to the man who resurrected the noble mixologist			1
after working as a driver for @entity308 and pursuing an acting career , @entity220 first landed a job as a waiter and a bartender in the early 1960s			1
now 65 , @entity220 recalls the moment he rediscovered the now - infamous term and says he saw the rise of its popularity coming			1
" @entity317 , my mentor and the man who many believe was one of the movers in the early days of the culinary , wine , and , through me , the cocktail revolution of the last 40 years , shared his vision with me , " says @entity220			1
" so yes , i did know we were onto something that would change the scene for decades to come			0
" those decades i spoke of above are just beginning			0
" now that beverage is on a more equal footing with the culinary side of the business , the two will become inseparable -- and i am not just speaking about wine			0
" @entity220 does n't mind the flood of self - proclaimed " mixologists " in the market , and reminds me of the positive influence the term and the movement have had on the business of bartending			1
" the question really is not too much or too little , but good or bad			0
" of course there are a few out there calling themselves ' master mixologists ' who do n't have the chops to perform at that level , but the market will sort that out quickly , " says @entity220			2
that 's a final word on mixologists even my grouchy editor might drink to			0

for some , the term " mixologist " suggests pretension and *expensive* drinks
dating to the 1850s , the term was resurrected by @entity51 bartender @entity220 in the 1980s
@entity220 and others say the term helps differentiate beer *slingers* from barkeeps who study the craft of cocktail making
