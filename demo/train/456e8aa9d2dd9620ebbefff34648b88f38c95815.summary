two girls in @entity1 , 14 and 12 , have been arrested and charged with aggravated stalking -- cyberbullying			1
they allegedly tormented a 12 - year - old girl named @entity4 so relentlessly that last month , @entity4 leapt to her death from a tower in an abandoned concrete plant			1
the arrest came after the following post was made on the 14 - year - old 's @entity11 account : " @entity13 i bullied @entity14 nd she killed herself but @entity16			1
" @entity18 sheriff @entity17 said he would charge the parents if he could , but there were no " obvious charges " against them			1
before filing charges against the girls , @entity17 asked the parents to bring the girls in for questioning			1
if a teenager makes @entity11 posts about the suicide of the girl she allegedly bullied , the parents might argue that they have no effective way to monitor or curtail her online behavior			1
they could say they do n't know what she 's doing , and they do n't care			0
mother of girl accused of bullying @entity1 teen arrested on unrelated charges the question is this : is ignorance and apathy about a child 's cyberbullying criminal ? under our current laws , it looks like the answer is no. but in a case such as this , should willful blindness or gross negligence be criminal ? i think they should , and here 's why : if a child kills someone while operating a parent 's car , the parents can be held responsible			1
if a child kills someone while using a parent 's gun , the parent can be held responsible			1
if a child breaks the law using a computer or cell phone provided by the parent , how is that different ? parents need to understand that the technology they give to their children can be used to break the law and inflict harm			1
parents need to understand that allowing their children the privilege of going online comes with responsibility and liability			1
the father of the 14 - year - old girl in this case spoke to @entity84 's @entity83 and said he regularly checks his daughter 's @entity11 account			1
he said his daughter was asleep when the @entity11 post was made , and he suspects the account was hacked			1
when asked about other online services used by the daughter , @entity92 and @entity93 , the parents indicated they had not heard of them			2
most of today 's parents would be astonished by their children 's online behavior			2
but they should n't be			0
just because today 's parents did n't grow up with social media does n't mean they can be forgiven for not knowing about it			2
the @entity101 is a portal to a boundless virtual world			0
it offers enormous opportunities for social interaction , and i 'd suspect most tweens and teenagers would argue it is crucial to their socialization experience			0
if they 're not online , they 're missing out			0
parents , beware of bullying on sites you 've never seen that means it is fertile grounds for those who wish to harass , antagonize or bully			1
and it 's a place where they can inflict emotional injury in a detached , almost anonymous way -- a coward 's way			0
if parents are not going to assume responsibility for their children 's online access on their own -- and it seems like the parents in this case are not -- then i would support legislation that places legal responsibility on parents , making them liable for what the children do with the online access parents provide			2
i am drafting a bill that would give @entity17 and other sheriffs the " obvious charges " needed to hold parents accountable			2
i do not think we should enact knee - jerk legislation because of a singular event , but this is not a singular event			2
i 'm thinking about the @entity150 rape case , where teenage boys felt it was ok to post photos showing abuse of a teenage girl online			2
i 'm thinking about the case of a former @entity157 player who discovered 300 teens were vandalizing his home because they were posting on social media while they did it			0
where are the parents ? i understand there are substantial obstacles in the way of passing such legislation			2
@entity168 , i worked for the @entity169 , and i learned how to draft a bill that can pass constitutional muster and which addresses urgent matters in a balanced way			0
while it is a straightforward process to hold a parent responsible when a child uses a dangerous object such as a gun , it 's more difficult in the case of a nondangerous device such as a cell phone or a computer			2
moreover , holding a parent liable requires proof that they had knowledge of the activity , or at least were grossly negligent in their parental responsibilities , and we have to recognize that teenagers can find ways to avoid detection			0
in this context , a parent could be grossly negligent by having absolutely no supervision of child 's internet presence ( just like leaving a kid in a hot car , or playing on a busy street ) , or if a parent was notified of potential problems with internet presence by a complaining parent or a school official or cop , and then failed to do anything to address it			0
. finally , there are constitutional due - process concerns with holding a third party liable for criminal acts , especially when a statute already exists to hold the child criminally liable			1
in the wake of this suicide , @entity17 has implored parents to take more responsibility for their children 's online behavior			1
if parents wo n't adopt that responsibility , we need to hold their feet to the fire and insist they share liability , especially when their children 's actions have life or death consequences			1
social media has entered the " @entity232 " phase			0
it 's been unregulated so far because it 's fallen outside the view of our lawmakers			0
nonetheless , we are seeing example after example of people using social media for nefarious purposes			0
cyberbullying is an undeniable problem , and we should not be satisfied with just asking kids to " toughen up and take it			0
" i believe that kids have a right to some sense of safety and security , and that is threatened by cyberbullying			0
it 's up to parents to protect their kids , and if they do n't know how to , maybe some legislation holding them liable if they do n't will provide the needed motivation for them to get involved in their kids ' online lives			0
this issue is urgent and critical , and we need to act before we lose another child .			0

@entity261 : two @entity1 girls charged with cyberbullying of 12 - year - old who committed suicide
