@entity0 , @entity1 -- after four days of testimony and 20 prosecution witnesses , @entity5			0
@entity7 's defense attorney spent only 35 minutes wednesday questioning just two witnesses before resting their case			1
@entity7 is accused of committing the biggest intelligence leak in @entity12 history			1
his @entity14 hearing is part of the military 's process of determining whether he should face court martial			1
the first defense witness called was sgt. @entity21 who served with @entity7 in @entity22 and witnessed one of several angry outbursts witnesses have described			1
@entity21 was the senior enlisted man on the night shift in the intelligence office where @entity7 worked			1
he testified that in december 2009 , @entity7 was late for duty and they sat down in a conference room so @entity21 could counsel him			1
@entity21 said when they began talking , @entity7 was calm , but that he began to change			1
at some point , said @entity21 , @entity7 grabbed the conference room table and turned the table over , knocking a computer and radio to the floor			2
because there was a rifle in the room , @entity21 testified that he did n't want @entity7 to get his hands on it , so " i coaxed him away from that , put my hands on his shoulder and coaxed him away			2
" at that point another soldier came in the room , subdued @entity7 , sat him down and @entity21 continued counseling him , @entity21 testified			2
when asked by @entity7 's attorney @entity49 if @entity21 remembered master sgt. @entity50 , the senior enlisted man in the unit , talking with him about the incident , @entity21 said " vaguely			1
" @entity21 testified said he did not discuss the outburst with the major who oversaw the intelligence analysis officers , the company 's first sergeant nor the company commander			2
@entity7 was not moved out of the intelligence office after the outburst and did not lose his security clearance as a result of the outburst			1
@entity49 has argued that the @entity63 should have known about @entity7 's emotional issues and kept him away from classified materials			1
@entity7 is accused of stealing and leaking nearly three - quarters of a million classified documents from the @entity67 and the @entity68 to the @entity70 website , which published many of them			2
the leaks occurred while @entity7 was serving as an intelligence analyst in @entity22 in 2009 and 2010			2
prosecution witnesses testified that @entity7 downloaded and leaked 400,000 @entity68 field reports from @entity22 and 90,0000 similar documents from @entity78			1
there was also evidence presented that he downloaded and leaked more than 250,000 @entity67 cables			0
@entity83 's second witness , capt. @entity82 , testified by phone about his time with @entity7 's unit			1
for a short time in december 2009 , he was an officer in the intelligence analysis office where @entity7 worked			2
@entity82 said he often saw soldiers listening to music in the office where classified materials were analyzed			0
at first he thought it was not proper , but he was told it was " an accepted practice " that was " tolerated because it helped soldiers be more productive			0
" in news reports before the hearing , @entity7 is said to have bragged in a chat room that he was able to download materials onto a cd while pretending to listen to @entity99			1
@entity82 told the hearing , " i do feel like he wanted to be a good soldier			0
he did good analytical work			0
" even though he called only two , @entity49 had requested 48 witnesses , ten of whom were already on the prosecution witness list			2
the investigating officer overseeing the case granted those ten and two other defense witnesses who were not on the prosecution list			2
he rejected other requested defense witnesses , including president @entity114 and secretary of state @entity115			0
@entity116 , a national security attorney , said the fact the defense called only two witnesses is not surprising			0
" for one thing , an @entity14 ( hearing ) serves as an opportunity for the defense to obtain pre-trial discovery , and particularly information they do not know			0
additionally , the likelihood of stopping charges from going forward is non-existent in this case so there is little value in telegraphing to the prosecution information the defense may possess but might not yet have revealed , " said @entity116			0
closing arguments from both sides are scheduled to start thursday morning			0
after that the @entity134 , lt. col. @entity135 , who oversaw the hearing , will consider the testimony and evidence and make a recommendation as to whether @entity7 should face court martial and if so , on which charges			1
the burden of proof at this level of the military justice system is " whether reasonable grounds exist to believe that the accused committed the offenses alleged			0
" the @entity149 , col. @entity150 , has given @entity135 until jan. 16 , 2012 to submit his recommendation			0
but , if needed , @entity135 can request more time			0
witnesses for the prosecution have characterized @entity7 as being troubled by @entity63 discipline and testified that he allegedly bragged on the internet about the leak of classified documents			1
army investigators also testified that they found evidence linking @entity7 to the leaked documents on computers he used			0
prosecutors have leveled 22 charges against the @entity63 private , including aiding the enemy			0
if convicted on all counts , he could face the death penalty			0
however , @entity63 prosecutors have signaled they will not recommend death in the event of a conviction , and it is unlikely they would be overruled by a senior officer			0
on tuesday , a convicted computer hacker from @entity175 who became a confidential informant for the @entity63 testified about six days of online chats that he had with someone he believes was @entity7			1
@entity180 said he traded instant messages in a chat format with someone self - identified as @entity184			0
@entity180 testified that based on an e-mail he received from @entity186 , as well as an examination of @entity7 's @entity189 page , that @entity184 was @entity7			1
@entity191 special agent @entity190 later testified that the chat logs that @entity180 provided to the @entity63 largely matched chat logs found on @entity7 's computer in @entity22 .			1
