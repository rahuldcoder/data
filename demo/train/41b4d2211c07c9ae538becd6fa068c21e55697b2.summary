@entity0 , @entity1 -- it is easy to dismiss @entity5 's threats against @entity1 as bluster , unless you 're on this island , within sight of @entity5 waters			1
the residents of @entity0 , like any other @entity1 , do their best to make ends meet , in their case mostly by fishing and trapping crabs			1
but they live in the shadow of a belligerent @entity5 , a mere four miles away			1
angered by tougher @entity19 sanctions and joint military exercises by the @entity21 and @entity1 , @entity17 has issued a range of bombastic threats in recent weeks			1
the slew of fiery rhetoric from @entity17 has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the @entity21 and @entity1 , as well as the declaration that the armistice that stopped the @entity30 in 1953 is no longer valid			2
those who live here worry about the poor weather that is dampening this year 's fishing season ; they also fear that their homes could be shelled			2
@entity5 shelled @entity0 in november 2010 , killing two @entity1 marines and two civilians			1
shells just rained down on the small island , causing widespread panic and destruction			0
the memories of the attack are still fresh			0
a few of the destroyed houses have been preserved as a reminder that visitors can see			0
there are scorched walls , some of them pockmarked with shrapnel and broken glass			0
family rooms that were burned out have been left empty			0
it 's a memorial to those who lost their lives , but also a reminder of the danger that @entity5 poses to the @entity1 , and this community in particular			1
" it 's been almost three years , and i remember how my heart sank when i witnessed the attacks			2
now we are hearing more threats , and i am having this feeling in my chest all over again , " said @entity69 , a @entity0 resident			2
the fear was made worse by recent images of @entity5 's leader , @entity76 , being feted by the same artillery units that carried out the strike			1
their attack is portrayed as a military victory that could be repeated , adding to pressure on @entity1 to respond with tough action next time			2
" if the @entity84 were to carry out another provocation like in 2010 , i personally hope that my government will respond very strongly			0
by doing this , the @entity84 will not see @entity1 as an easy target but as a strong country instead , " @entity69 said			0
@entity0 is a two - hour ferry trip from the @entity1 mainland , but the sentiment among residents is that they will not flee			1
this is the only home they know , another resident said			0
also , evacuating can be costly to the majority working - class residents			0
a mix of economics and loyalty keeps them here			0
in fact , many residents wo n't talk on the record to reporters , for fear of further upsetting the island 's popularity among tourists			1
most observers say @entity5 is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile , but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower , including medium - range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles			1
the heightened tensions on the @entity122 came after the @entity84 carried out a long - range rocket launch in december and an underground nuclear test last month , prompting the @entity125 to step up sanctions on the secretive government			0
nowhere are those tensions felt stronger than on this island			1
@entity2 's @entity131 contributed to this report .			0

tensions between @entity5 and the @entity1 have risen recently
it is particularly felt on @entity0 , @entity1
the island is a stone 's throw from @entity5 and was attacked three years *ago*
residents try to live their lives as best they can
