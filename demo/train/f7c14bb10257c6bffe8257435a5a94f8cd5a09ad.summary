-- @entity3 @entity2 and @entity4 remain far apart in their effort to avert a year - end combination of spending cuts and tax increases that could trigger a new recession , majority leader @entity1 said sunday			1
" there 's still significant distance between the two sides , but negotiations continue , " @entity1 said as @entity10 held a rare sunday session in a bid to avoid the so - called fiscal cliff			1
" there 's still time left to reach an agreement , and we intend to continue negotiations			2
" no votes will be held sunday , but @entity1 said there may be further announcements when the @entity3 reconvenes monday morning : " i certainly hope so			1
" with barely a day left to avert what economists predict will be a one - two punch to the @entity29 economy , talks hit what a @entity4 source called a " major setback " when @entity2 insisted that changes to how @entity34 benefits are adjusted for inflation be included			1
@entity2 have dropped that demand , but " they never should have been on the table to begin with , " said @entity1 , @entity40			1
using what 's known as " chained @entity42 " would change the way @entity34 benefits are adjusted for inflation , meaning that future @entity34 recipients would receive less money over time			2
democrats consider this prospect a " poison pill , " the source said , and @entity2 senators said later it would n't be included			1
" if that is a show - stopper for the majority leader , we will take that off the table , " @entity55 sen. @entity54 told reporters after coming out of a @entity2 caucus meeting sunday afternoon			1
with the clock running down , senate minority leader @entity59 appealed to vice president @entity61 to help " jump - start " negotiations after complaining that he had received no response to an offer he put on the table saturday night			1
" i want everyone to know i 'm willing to get this done , but i need a dance partner , " said @entity67 , @entity68			1
@entity67 and @entity61 , who served together in the @entity3 for more than two decades , were having a " pretty fruitful " conversation sunday afternoon , said sen. @entity73 , @entity74			1
@entity1 said earlier that @entity67 has shown " absolutely good faith " in the talks , but " it 's just that we are apart on some pretty big issues			1
" as he headed home sunday evening , @entity1 was asked about progress , and he responded : " talk to @entity61 and @entity67			1
" top - level sources on both sides of the negotiations said talks are primarily now in the hands of @entity67 and @entity61 , and they are keeping @entity1 and @entity88 speaker @entity87 , @entity89 , informed			1
if nothing gets done before monday night at midnight , the expiration of the @entity93 administration 's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will increase tax rates , while $ 110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending -- the result of the 2011 standoff over raising the federal debt ceiling -- will start to kick in			2
the nonpartisan @entity101 predicts the combined effect could dampen economic growth by 0.5 % , possibly tipping the @entity29 economy back into a recession and driving unemployment back over 9 %			0
in an interview aired sunday on @entity110 's " @entity109 , " president @entity107 blamed @entity2 for the stalemate that brought lawmakers back to @entity113 on a weekend			1
@entity107 urged the @entity2 to drop its opposition to tax increases on top earners and cut a last - minute deal			1
" they say that the biggest priority is making sure that we deal with the deficit in a serious way			2
but the way they 're behaving is that their only priority is making sure that tax breaks for the wealthiest @entity29 are protected , " he said			0
" that seems to be their only overriding , unifying theme			0
" @entity107 told @entity110 that could cost the average middle - class family about $ 2,000			1
he said the @entity3 should go ahead and vote on legislation to make sure middle - class taxes are not raised and that 2 million people do n't lose unemployment benefits			2
" if we can get that done , that takes a big bite out of the fiscal cliff , " he said			0
" it avoids the worst outcomes			0
" during the interview , @entity107 said he was willing to consider using chained @entity42 to adjust @entity34 -- even though it was " highly unpopular among @entity4 " and opposed by the @entity146 , the powerful lobby for seniors			1
" in pursuit of strengthening @entity34 for the long term , i 'm willing to make those decisions , " @entity107 said			1
" what i 'm not willing to do is to have the entire burden of deficit reduction rest on the shoulders of seniors , making students pay higher student loan rates , ruining our capacity to invest in things like basic research that help our economy grow			0
those are the things that i 'm not willing to do			0
" but the @entity4 source , who did not want to be identified because of the closed nature of the talks , said members understand @entity107 proposed using chained @entity42 as an element of a larger deal that also would change how the federal debt ceiling is adjusted -- an element no longer included in the plans			1
most democrats oppose chained @entity42 , but many were wiling to go along with it as part of a larger deal , the source said			2
on taxes , meanwhile , democrats are arguing that taxes should go up for those making $ 250,000 or more , though some discussions have involved the possibility of raising that figure to a $ 400,000 threshold			2
many republicans have opposed any increase in tax rates			0
@entity87 suffered a political setback by offering a compromise -- a $ 1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in -- that his @entity88 colleagues refused to support			0
after @entity107 's @entity110 interview , @entity87 said the president needs to stand up to his own party and insisted it was the president " who has never been able to get to ' yes			1
' " " i am pleased senators from both parties are currently working to find a bipartisan solution that can finally pass that chamber , " @entity87 said in a statement issued by his office			0
" that is the type of leadership @entity29 needs , not what they saw from the president this morning			0
" sunday night , @entity87 met with @entity88 @entity2 leaders and told them to sit tight and stick together as he awaits news on whether the @entity3 can strike a deal			1
after the meeting , @entity213 rep. @entity212 told reporters that @entity87 said : " i 've stayed out of those negotiations			0
" " every time we get involved in them , we sort of get burned , so we 're going to let the @entity3 work its will , see what they do and what they send us , and we 'll act accordingly , " he said			0
sen. @entity224 , @entity40 - @entity225 , told @entity230 's " @entity229 " he thought the chances of a short - term , last - minute deal brokered by @entity3 leaders were better than 50 - 50			1
" i 've been a legislator for 37 years , and i 've watched how these things work on these big , big agreements , " @entity224 said			0
" they almost always happen at the last minute			0
" and sen. @entity234 , @entity68 - @entity235 , said the chances are " exceedingly good " that some type of deal will be reached by monday night			2
" i think , whatever we accomplish , political victory to the president , hats off to the president			0
he 's going to get tax rate increases , maybe not $ 250,000 , but upper - income @entity29 , " @entity234 said on " @entity247			2
" " and the sad news for the country is that we have accomplished little in terms of not becoming @entity253 or getting out of debt			0
" other republicans argued sunday that @entity107 's plan has n't done enough to limit spending			1
" the president is doing nothing about the addiction that his administration has to spending			0
he 's the spender in chief , " sen. @entity263 of @entity264 said on @entity0 's " @entity265			2
" @entity107 told @entity110 that he has cut more than $ 1 trillion in spending and offered another $ 1 trillion - plus in additional cuts " so that we would have $ 2 of spending cuts for every $ 1 of increased revenue			1
" he said the majority of @entity29 have made clear they support his calls for " a balanced approach " that would increase taxes on the wealthy			1
sen. @entity277 , @entity278 , warned that now is " exactly the wrong time to go over this cliff			0
" " we are in the midst of an economic recovery			0
we are seeing new job creation , businesses are seeing new growth , we are seeing the kind of economic indicators we 've been waiting for for years			0
this going over the cliff is going to bring uncertainty to our markets , and with that uncertainty , a pullback in consumer confidence and a reduction , i 'm afraid , of business activity and the creation of new jobs , " he said			0
but former @entity4 chairman and 2004 presidential contender @entity300 told @entity230 that heading over the cliff would not be so bad , calling it a " fiscal curb " instead			0
" you go back to the @entity306 tax rates , and you make some significant cuts			2
and you cut the @entity310 , which has n't been cut in 30 years , " said @entity300 , a former @entity308 governor			2
meanwhile , going over the cliff gives @entity107 more leverage , " because then all of sudden , middle - class people 's taxes are going to rise , and that 's going to be bad for every politician in @entity319			1
" " maybe they 'll actually get something done , " he said			0
" but i think , at this point , at this late hour , i think almost any deal they come up with is worse than going over the cliff			2
" sen. @entity326 , @entity327 , told @entity0 's " @entity265 " that she expects @entity10 will vote to extend tax cuts for incomes below $ 250,000 -- perhaps below $ 400,000 -- before midnight monday			2
a @entity3 agreement " would build momentum " for the move in the @entity88 , she said			0
" i think it would be horrific for the country if at this time , the final days of this legislative session that already has reached historic proportions of failure , that we would now culminate in failure to extend these tax cuts , " said @entity326 , who is on her way out of office			0
@entity0 's @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 and @entity349 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity67 and @entity61 are main negotiators now , sources on both sides say
" there 's still significant distance between the two sides , " @entity1 says
@entity107 calls on @entity2 to cut a deal on taxes ; @entity2 argue @entity107 is *overspending*
