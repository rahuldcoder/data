-- by tradition , @entity1 is represented by two masks : the happy face of the comic muse @entity6 and her sad counterpart , the tragic muse @entity9			1
if @entity1 were @entity11 , you 'd need a million more			1
he was a mask of howling laughter , a mask of wide - eyed innocence			1
even , at times , a blank			2
if it seemed like we knew what went on behind the many masks , it was because @entity11 ' quicksilver mind and boundless talent possessed enough energy to blow them right off his face			1
he was @entity31 of " @entity32			2
" he was @entity33 , and " @entity36 's " genie , and mrs. @entity35			2
but he was also the restrained garp in " @entity37 , " and the creepy @entity38 in " @entity39 , " and the firm but compassionate @entity41 in " @entity42 , " the performance that won him an @entity44			2
it was that side of @entity11 -- something raw and vulnerable , not something manic and boisterous -- that made you wonder : who was he when he took off the mask ? on monday , @entity11 was found dead in his home in @entity51 , @entity52			1
coroner investigators suspect " the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia , " according to a statement from the @entity55 , @entity52 , @entity56			1
it 's a @entity61 © , of course , the clown who laughs on the outside while crying -- or dying -- on the inside			2
it 's @entity69 's @entity68 and @entity71 's @entity70 ; @entity72 and @entity74 's @entity73			2
show business history is filled with stories of comic kings who fought against depression and substance abuse , not always successfully			1
@entity80 , @entity11 ' hero , was institutionalized for a time			1
the effortless @entity81 once said he was " mostly drunk for 15 years			2
" @entity82 and @entity83 died of overdoses			0
@entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 -- all funny men , all gone before their time			1
there 's no question that comedy can be a form of escape -- and recognition			0
@entity96 , one of the most brilliant comedians who ever strode on stage , was raised in a brothel , married multiple times , struggled with demons both societal and personal			0
he was ruthless -- especially on himself			0
yet he was scathingly , mercilessly funny			0
it was comedy that drew blood , comedy as catharsis			0
@entity83 , on the other hand , grew up in a close - knit , comfortable clan -- but also sometimes seemed to be running from something			1
his immersion in @entity110 , the divorced motivational speaker who lived in a " van down by the river , " was both hilarious and a little scary			0
" we lose at least one great comic to suicide or @entity117 every year , " tweeted comedian @entity113 on monday			1
" our jobs are to communicate , but we seem to not know how to ask for help			0
" @entity11 , the son of an auto company executive and a model , was remarkably open about his own battles			1
he was a chubby , bullied child who found he could make others laugh			0
later , on talk shows , he could be outrageously stream - of - consciousness , a bicycle careening down a hill without any brakes -- and , just as quickly , brutally honest , admitting to sadnesses and abuses and mistakes			1
" his bearing is intensely @entity136 and almost mournful , and when he 's not putting on voices he speaks in a low , tremulous baritone -- as if on the verge of tears -- that would work very well if he were delivering a funeral eulogy , " wrote @entity132 , who interviewed him for the @entity133 in 2010			0
inevitably , he 'd make light of the problem -- the great line , " cocaine is @entity147 's way of telling you that you make too much money , " is his -- but underneath there was a sense of a man wrestling with demons , a man wishing to put on another mask in an attempt to scare them away			2
it is a mask that perhaps only the most blameless of us have never tried on			0
but if it 's another @entity160 © that comedians hide anger under all those laughs , @entity11 did n't fit the stereotype			1
with him , what was underneath was compassion			0
it showed in his performances , notably the therapist in " @entity42			0
" it showed in his participation in such causes as @entity173 , which raised money for the homeless , and in his @entity177 tours , entertaining troops in @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181			0
celebrities remember @entity11 he 'd had open - heart surgery several years ago , and it made him reflect on mortality			1
" it breaks through your barrier , you 've literally cracked the armor			0
and you 've got no choice , it literally breaks you open , " he told the @entity133			0
sure , there were performances in which he seemed less than kind -- whether on screen , as a villain in " @entity195 : @entity196 , " or in his real life , with messy divorces that he described , with perhaps a touch of bitterness , as " ripping your heart out through your wallet			0
" given all that , who would n't want to put on @entity6 's mask , with laughter riding across the audience in waves , approval on demand , smiles all around ? @entity11 wore it well			1
it 's sad that , in the end , he exited with @entity9			0

while widely - regarded as one of the funniest men alive , @entity11 was battling depression
many comics are *commonly* known to have a *darker* side
