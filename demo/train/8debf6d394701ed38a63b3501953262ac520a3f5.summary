@entity0 -- @entity0 ushered in the @entity2 with a bold move			1
starting this week , the city 's @entity4 has begun reporting air quality data that includes readings of @entity8 , or @entity8 smaller than 2.5 micrometers , and other pollutants			1
@entity10 , a blogger on @entity11 , a @entity12 - like microblog site , tweeted : " thank the government for making this effort to solve the problem			1
it is a @entity17 gift from them to the people			0
" @entity20 , @entity21 director of @entity22 , a @entity23 - based independent group , hailed it as " a major step forward " for @entity21 's air pollution control efforts			1
" this decision is a timely response of the government to a public outcry to tighten the standards and regulations on air pollutants , " she says			2
contrary to @entity17 officials ' claims that the city 's air quality has improved since it hosted the @entity39 , many residents in @entity0 have complained about worsening air pollution			1
" reached the standard ? " asked @entity17 blogger @entity41			0
" they did n't just pick the spot where the air quality is the best , did they ? " public cynicism and frustration peaked several days ago when for two days the city was covered with heavy haze and smog , forcing the cancellation of almost 700 flights at @entity0 airports			1
debate over the credibility of @entity0 's air quality reporting has been brewing for months			1
it all came to a boil in november when @entity0 's @entity4 reported the city 's air quality as " slightly polluted , " while the @entity62 in @entity0 , using its own monitoring instruments , tweeted its real - time reading as " hazardous			1
" why the discrepancy ? @entity0 , it turned out , merely reported the @entity8 readings , which measured only larger particles , while the @entity70 @entity62 readings measured ozone density and @entity8 , referring to particulates " small enough to get into the lungs and the blood stream , " according to the embassy website			1
should @entity21 adopt the stricter pm2.5 standards ? some prominent personalities , including @entity17 environmentalists , entrepreneurs and journalists , think so			0
last december , real estate mogul @entity81 conducted an online poll on @entity11			2
more than 90 % of the more than 40,000 respondents agreed that " the authorities should adopt pm2.5 standard this year ( 2011 )			0
" four percent believed " it can wait until next year , " while only one percent thought there was no need to adopt it			0
experts say @entity0 's adoption of @entity8 this week shows the growing influence of local public opinion			1
" it seems clear that public pressure has played a role and has speeded up @entity0 city 's implementation of the new measures , " says @entity93 , advisor of the @entity94 , which runs a climate energy and pollution program in @entity21			1
although @entity21 sometimes seems to drag its feet in solving its environmental problems , @entity93 says the @entity105 have taken some creditable steps			0
" @entity21 has implemented the largest build - out of @entity108 , or scrubbers , ever seen over the last five years , " she says			2
" these are to control sulfur dioxide on power plants			0
" @entity0 has also increased its enforcement of building standards			2
" @entity0 and other cities are quite good at installing insulation and other building efficiency measures that reduce energy use and this reduce pollution , " says the @entity0 - based expert			1
@entity93 also praises @entity0 's push to expand its network of subway lines			1
" people often forget that they 've continued to build major lines since the @entity126 , " she says			0
" it was n't just for show , it was to serve this city			0
" four new subway lines are expected to start operating later this year			0
fares on subways and public buses remain cheap to encourage more people to take public transport			0
the number of vehicles in @entity0 reached 4.98 million last year , worsening traffic congestion and air pollution			1
" we have a high population density , " says @entity140 , a professor at @entity141			0
" it 's not necessary for everyone to drive their own cars			0
if we have a more developed subway system and public buses , it 's not difficult to control the number of cars			2
" despite all these efforts , experts say , @entity0 is still a long way from cleaning up its reputation as a polluted city			1
@entity93 likens @entity0 with @entity158			2
" with their difficult meteorological conditions and a large number of pollution sources , addressing pollution is a long - term and difficult task , " she explains			2
" @entity158 began to combat air pollution in the mid- 1950s , well before @entity70 national regulation , and still in the 1970s , 20 years later , it was famous for its smog			1
in the 40 - plus years since the @entity169 was passed , @entity158 has never been fully in compliance with @entity172 standards , even though it has continued to improve			0
" @entity0 has likewise made a lot of progress since 2006 , @entity93 said			2
" but they have years of work ahead of them , and there is n't one single silver bullet or one fundamental problem			0
what is good is that they have begun , and they have an engaged public that supports tighter regulation			0
" @entity81 , the real estate billionaire who pushed for pm 2.5 readings , said adopting stricter standards is the right step			0
" only when people have the knowledge of the air quality around them will they change unhealthy behavior , " he said			0
with the adoption of @entity8 , @entity0 residents may now reasonably expect to get realistic readings -- " hazardous , " not " slightly polluted " -- when the city 's air quality is really bad .			1

many residents in @entity0 have complained about worsening air pollution
in november , @entity4 reported " slightly polluted "
@entity62 in @entity0 tweeted its real - time reading as " hazardous "
experts say @entity0 's adoption of @entity8 shows growing influence of public opinion
