when we last saw @entity3 congressman @entity2 on @entity5 's " @entity4 , " he was being offered an appointment to the vice presidency of the @entity8			1
how much trouble can that cause ? given what @entity2 did in the first season of the show , probably more than anybody anticipates			1
do n't expect him to be the glad - handing , funeral - attending type of @entity15 ; @entity2 is more likely to be holding a knife or two , the better to stab people in the back -- or , if it 's necessary , in the front			1
" @entity4 , " which helped establish @entity5 as an original programmer -- rather than those folks who send you dvds in red envelopes -- returns friday for its second season			1
like the first , it will be available for download all at once , which may mean that a lot of @entity31 dinners grow cold while fans binge on watching 13 straight episodes			2
as the second season begins , @entity34 's @entity2 reveals that the vice presidency wo n't change his cold , pragmatic cardiac muscle			1
" one heartbeat away from the presidency and not a single vote cast in my name , " he says at his swearing - in			2
" democracy is so overrated			0
" ' he believes ideology is a form of weakness ' it 's a long way from the beginning of the first season , when @entity2 was denied his desired job as secretary of state			1
but in a long - running game of " do n't get mad , get even , " @entity2 -- with help from @entity54 , his subtly brutal chief of staff ( @entity54 ) ; @entity55 , his devoted and equally conniving lobbyist wife ( @entity56 ) ; and @entity57 , a pliable , ambitious reporter ( @entity57 ) -- managed to knock down his obstacles and maneuver his way up the @entity61 food chain			1
if a few bodies were left in his wake -- figuratively and , in one case , literally -- well , the ends justify the means			1
as @entity2 noted in the very first episode as he put a wounded dog out of its misery , " i have no patience for useless things			0
" but that 's not to say that @entity2 does n't also want to make the system work			0
in an interview last fall with @entity80 , showrunner @entity77 explained that @entity2 , at heart , is " an optimist , " though he understands the darker view			0
' @entity4 ' creator @entity77 plays a solid hand " where i think people mistake his optimism for cynicism is that he 's unapologetically self - interested			1
he believes ideology is a form of weakness -- a form of cowardice , " @entity77 said			1
the writer and producer observes that one of the character 's models is @entity101 , known for his shrewd knowledge of the legislative process both as a senator and as president			0
@entity77 added that " @entity4 " is n't necessarily a show about politics , despite its @entity61 setting			1
it 's a show about power -- in all its manifestations			1
" that power is displayed in our love lives , or our work environments , the way we comport ourselves when randomness brushes up against us , " he says			2
and , he adds , power can be more useful than money : " power has no limits if you 're willing to go far enough in order to get as much of it as you can			2
" ' mr. @entity125 goes to @entity61 ' ? naturally , @entity77 and his stars have been tight - lipped about how far @entity2 will take things in a show the @entity129 nicknamed " mr. @entity125 goes to @entity61			1
" trailers and tidbits , however , offer some tantalizing hints			0
there 's a suggestion that @entity2 could be implicated in a murder investigation			0
perhaps @entity57 might be locating her ethics			0
a @entity138 profile of @entity77 mentioned a " super-duper - double - major spoiler			0
" and @entity2 appears headed for a showdown with wealthy industrialist -- and fellow power broker -- @entity143 ( @entity144 ) , a friend of the president			1
just as intriguing is the future of @entity2 's wife , @entity55			0
in the first season 's early episodes , she seemed more troubled by unethical behavior than her husband ; after all , she was a lobbyist for environmental issues			2
but that changed as she found her own livelihood threatened			0
in this , she is much like her husband , said @entity158			0
" she is a pragmatist in the art of war , " the actress told @entity160			0
however the second season concludes , " @entity4 " has already been a winner			1
@entity5 spent $ 100 million to produce the show 's first two seasons			2
in return , the show was nominated for eight emmy awards last fall , winning three , and @entity5 's subscriber base and stock price have both hit new highs			2
the service has quickly become a major player for original programming , with last summer 's " @entity179 " also earning raves			0
the company recently renewed " @entity4 " for a third season			1
in the meantime , one can only wonder whether a better @entity184 parallel for @entity2 is " @entity186 's " @entity185 , dropping poisoned hints in the president 's ear			0
all @entity77 will promise is the show will hold on to its darkness			2
" there are people who do n't like the level of darkness , who find the characters unsympathetic , " he told the @entity138			0
" and we need to own that			0

" @entity4 " returns for second season on friday
show stars @entity34 as conniving congressman -- now one step from @entity205
show is less about @entity61 politics than about power , says creator
