-- when i was launching @entity4 nine years ago , one of the key elements i was determined to introduce was a regular column dedicated to promoting and supporting @entity7 design talents			1
we were the first fashion magazine to do this on a regular basis , but it was not easy			2
there really were n't many people whose designs could hold up alongside all the international brands we featured			0
nowadays , we are overwhelmed with design talent , both from emerging independent designers and from domestic @entity7 fashion brands , and very often , we wish we had more space to feature more of them			1
we started off lending a platform in the magazine for young local designers			1
but gradually , we started developing various initiatives beyond the magazine in order to promote their designs and widen their scope of influence			2
for example , the @entity30 in collaboration with @entity32 in december 2011 and the @entity34 x @entity35 , launched in 2012 , which allows @entity7 designers to gain first - hand insight into the business and retail side of fashion in the @entity43 offices of leading companies like @entity45 and @entity46			1
whilst we were mostly focusing on independent designers , gradually , i began noticing that many @entity7 fashion brands were taking an increasingly international approach to the way they run their business			1
they had long been power players in the retail market here , but perhaps lacked the industry know - how of how to operate like an international fashion house , without samples , appropriate pr and a streamlined brand image			2
we started off by doing a feature on four major brands in our september 2011 issue and i was intrigued by the fascinating stories of their owners , who had all grown up in a society without fashion , but who were now relaying it to the masses with great commercial success			0
from then on , we have witnessed a growing maturity amongst these brands and their new season designs are often featured within the magazine			0
see who else has been on @entity79 more recently , we are so proud to see those such as @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 thriving on the international stage , as they show on schedule at @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity90 fashion week			0
in terms of design style and business acumen , this new generation is possessed of incredible confidence and industry awareness , and are a lot less na√Øve than the earlier designers			0
many of them were educated at design schools abroad , where they learnt to operate within the industry , both abroad and in @entity4			2
their success is also an example of the seismic shift which is happening in the @entity7 consumer market as people are moving beyond the logo - ed products , with a preference for more rarefied but discreet things			1
in this process , they are turning more and more towards @entity7 designers , who they feel offer products more tailored to @entity7 tastes and aesthetics than some of the international brands			1
compare the fashion choices of the first ladies of @entity122 and @entity4 the growth of this market is witnessed by the rising number of buyer 's boutiques who specialize in @entity7 designers in @entity130 and @entity131 , and increasingly spreading to other cities like @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			1
i do n't think the ' made in @entity4 ' label defines @entity7 designers today			1
many designers split their design and production between overseas and @entity4			1
this is a natural process borne out of financial , quality and logistical considerations			0
maybe a certain @entity145 fabric suits their design better , or maybe in some cases @entity7 craftsmanship is better			2
we live in a world which is getting smaller and smaller , and if for example , a @entity153 brand can produce in @entity145 without losing their identity , then i do n't see how it is any different for @entity7 designers			1
it is up to each designer to determine which production methods are best suited for them			0
sexy , skintight , sophisticated : how the cheongsma has survived a century of course , these young designers , like young talents everywhere else in the world , are also facing many challenges			2
a major one is how to create a brand that is really unique and stands out among the countless other designers and brands that are crowding the markets around the world already			0
they have to answer the question of " why does the world need another designer ? " not just for one season but consistently throughout years			0
the internet , whilst making some things easier , is also posing other challenges			0
a new idea does not remain new for long in this digital age			0
execution , delivery and efficiency are just as important as novel ideas			0
@entity7 designers need , like young designers all over the world , to learn to move beyond the derivative influence of previous designers and stand up for themselves			1
despite these challenges , i have confidence that in this , as in everything else in @entity4 , change will come much faster than most people expect			2
the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author , @entity202 .			0

@entity202 is editor - in - chief for @entity4
*journalist* has seen rise of @entity4 's *homegrown* fashion designers since magazine 's launch nine years ago
designers and consumers are maturing and going beyond the allure of well - known logos , she says
challenge is for young @entity7 designers to move beyond influence of others
