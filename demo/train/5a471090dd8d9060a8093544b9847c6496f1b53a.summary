@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 interrupted a campaign speech twice on thursday to seek help for people in the audience who collapsed			1
" i think we might have had somebody faint down here , so if we got the paramedics , " @entity3 said about halfway through his remarks under bright afternoon sunshine at @entity14			1
" they 'll be all right			0
just make sure you give them some space			0
and if somebody has a bottle of water , you might want to give it to them			0
" a few minutes later , near the end of his remarks , @entity3 again noted a member of the crowd in distress			1
" someone up here got a little hot			0
let ' em sit down			0
let ' em sit down , " he said to the audience , asking if there was a bottle of water on stage for the stricken person			2
" remember , next time you come out here , eat something and drink something " beforehand , @entity3 added			1
the president was stumping for @entity1 gov. @entity45 , who is seeking re-election			1
@entity48 medical personnel said they responded to a number of sick cases at the university on thursday			2
@entity53 spokesman @entity52 said that between 1:45 and 2 p.m. , about an hour before @entity3 's speech , ambulance crews stationed at the campus as part of the @entity58 event responded to reports of people " fainting , getting dizzy , and otherwise passing out			1
" @entity64 officials later told @entity2 they were treating at least two dozen people at the university for fainting and dehydration			0
@entity52 said that while the temperatures were mild , " in that rally area , the sun is extremely hot			0
" " in addition , that rally area was extremely crowded and compacted , " he said			0
" you had the rally people shoulder to shoulder , if not closer , and standing for an extended period of time and waiting for the rally to start			0
a lot of these people that we treated today were senior citizens , so they 're probably not accustomed to this type of environment , and those were the people that we found that experienced the fainting , the dizziness issues			1
" also , a heckler was heard shouting " you 're a liar ! " early in @entity3 's remarks			1
the man was shouted down by others in the crowd , and it was unclear whether the president heard him			2
