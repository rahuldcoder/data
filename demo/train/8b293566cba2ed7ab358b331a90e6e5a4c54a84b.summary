@entity0 -- the @entity2 on monday tossed out a provision in @entity5 's voter registration law that required proof of citizenship			1
the 7 - 2 majority said the state 's voter - approved @entity9 interfered with federal law designed to make voter registration easier			1
the state called the provision a " sensible precaution " to prevent voter fraud			1
civil rights group countered that it added an unconstitutional and burdensome layer of paperwork for tens of thousands of citizens			1
justice @entity21 said the @entity27 of 1993 " forbids states to demand an applicant submit additional information beyond that required by the federal form			1
" but in a nod to state authority , he said the federal law " does not prevent states from denying registration based on any information in their possession establishing the applicant 's eligibility			1
" the appeal was a classic federalism dispute , on the often delicate line between conflict and cooperation between state and federal governments over enforcing voting procedures			2
during last year 's election , there were numerous court challenges to state voter identification laws at the polls			1
the current fight has produced a range of states , lawmakers and advocacy groups on both sides on the gateway issue of registration			0
the @entity60 opposed the @entity5 law , which went beyond what other states have done to ensure integrity in the registration system			0
@entity67 governor rejects voter @entity69 measure retired justice @entity70 , an @entity5 native , was among those who attended the spirited april oral arguments			2
@entity27 justice @entity74 a year ago blocked the @entity5 law from being enforced , while the high court decided internally whether to accept pending appeals for review			2
the ballot measure was passed in 2004 and has been lingering in the federal courts ever since			0
the @entity81 's @entity80 says " the times , places , and manners of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature			2
" but @entity90 is also given the power " to make or alter such regulations			0
" federal lawmakers did just that , passing the @entity27 two decades ago , which has since been called the @entity27 , designed to streamline election participation			2
it requires states to have any application for a driver 's license treated also as a voter registration -- the " motor voter			2
" and it requires states to " accept and use " mail - in and in - person applications			0
a federal @entity106 was created to produce a nationally uniform voter application form , which states must use			2
any extra state instructions , or " add - ons , " must be approved by the commission			1
the question was whether certain extra instructions are permitted , and just how the federal from must be respected in the first place			0
the majority said the mail - in postcard was presumptive evidence of registration and of qualification			2
would - be voters would check off a box attesting they are a @entity124 citizen , then sign the form under penalty of perjury			0
the state said they had prosecuted cases of noncitizens registering to vote			0
dissenting justices in a dissent , justice @entity132 said the majority produced " truly strange results			1
" " what is a state to do if it has reason to doubt an applicant 's eligibility but can not be sure that the applicant is ineligible ? must the state either grant or deny registration without communicating with the applicant ? or does the court believe that a state may ask for additional information in individual cases but may not impose a categorical requirement for all applicants ? if that is the @entity2 's position , on which provision of the @entity27 does it rely ? the court 's reading of [ federal law ] is atextual and makes little sense			1
" justice @entity159 produced a separate dissent			1
but @entity21 and his six colleagues said that if the state were allowed to impose the additional requirements , " the federal form ceases to perform any meaningful function , and would feeble means of increasing the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for federal office			1
" registration problems among those bringing suit was @entity174 , a public school employee in @entity175 , @entity5 , who tried to register to vote the day he became a citizen			0
his application was twice rejected when his separate naturalization and driver 's license numbers were improperly " red - flagged " by state databases that initially indicated he was a noncitizen			1
the @entity183 , which helped bring the original lawsuit against the state regulations , said 31,000 potential voters had their applications rejected in the two years after the @entity5 law took effect			2
@entity183 said 90 % of those were born in the @entity124 the group 's @entity191 said voter registration drives at county fairs , church services and similar venues have dropped , since many potential voters do n't bring the necessary citizenship documents -- like a birth certificate -- to these community events			1
one estimate found a 45 % reduction in @entity203 , the state 's largest county and the seat of @entity206 , the capital			1
the @entity208 said about 13 million people nationwide lack documents proving their citizenship , and it praised monday 's ruling			0
" this decision reaffirms the principle that states may not undermine this critical law 's effectiveness by adding burdens not required under federal law , " said @entity214 , of the group 's @entity215			1
" in doing so , the court has taken a vital step in ensuring the ballot remains free , fair , and accessible for all citizens			0
" the @entity229 administration said that if the provision in @entity5 's law were allowed to continue , it would create a mishmash of regulations across the county			1
" each state could impose all manner of its own supplemental requirements beyond the federal form , " solicitor general @entity235 said			2
what supporters have to say but @entity9 200 supporters say the state needs the power to keep illegal immigrants and those ineligible to vote in the @entity124 from getting a ballot			1
" the integrity of our nation 's elections suffered a blow today from the @entity2 , " @entity246 , president of the conservative @entity247 , said monday			0
" this issue takes on increasing urgency with the prospect of 11 million illegal immigrants being given amnesty			0
it is essential that our elections be secured by ensuring that only citizens register to vote			0
" some @entity5 activists agreed			0
" i believe we must go out of our way to protect the integrity of @entity124 's elections , to avoid the fraud we see regularly in other nations , and which if not checked will rise up here in the @entity124 , " said @entity262 , a former state @entity263 president , who helped spearhead @entity9 200 's passage			1
" it ought to be common sense that proof of citizenship be required for voter registration , especially given the concrete evidence we 've seen that illegal aliens are indeed both registered and voting			0
but common sense and @entity124 's judicial system do n't always see eye to eye , and this is one area we 'll just have to keep working			0
" @entity70 has a professional stake in the current high court fight			0
as a retired justice , she can sit on lower appeals court cases , and she was part of a 9 - 2 majority to rule in 2010 that @entity5 's citizenship requirement conflicted with federal law			1
the @entity2 case is @entity5 v. @entity294 of @entity5 ( 12 - 71 )			0
