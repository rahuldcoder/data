we 'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly , along with the most flattering shades for day and night			1
for foolproof application , stick with sheer , subdued shades in the morning and save deep , bold colors ( which require more time and precision ) for night			1
condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen , like @entity27 with @entity28 20			2
" dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower , when your lips are still a little moist , " suggests @entity30 pro @entity29			1
the smoother your lips , the more perfect your lipstick will look			2
choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube			0
a hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color			0
blot , reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain , says @entity29			0
" the color looks more natural and lasts longer			0

exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy			1

one to try : @entity67 lip treatment ( $ 19 ; at drugstores )			0
define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding , says @entity74 , who gave @entity75 her deep fuchsia lip			0

brush on color for more control			0
try : @entity87 ( $ 35 ) with @entity89 lipstick in @entity90 ( $ 11 )			0
