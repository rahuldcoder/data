, the internet has provided us with a splendid way to reach out to others , connect with them across the channels of humanity and completely and utterly waste their time			1
picture this , if you will : whilst clicking dejectedly through your @entity15 , waiting for those @entity17 invites to come pouring in ( ca n't spend saturday night watching " @entity18 " and crying -- you did that last weekend ) , you decide to send a chat to your friend , interrupting her glassy - eyed computer monitor staring contest			1
and , unlike with e-mail , @entity17 messages , texts and even phone calls , comes an expectation that she shall answer now			1
and let me tell you something : more often than not , you 're likely annoying the hell out of her			1
why ? well , according to recent research from @entity38 , @entity36 spend a collective total of about 160 million hours per month instant messaging -- so the odds are pretty good			1
yes , chat is a wonderful way to pass the time during work ( " i will cleverly fool my boss into thinking i 'm hard at work by feverishly typing -- a detailed account of how i crowd - surfed into the arms of the riot police when they came to break up that illegal show last night " ) , to make plans on the fly or to communicate with that dude one cubicle over ( " my vocal chords are so weary ... let 's just have this meeting via @entity60 , mmk ? " )			1
but it 's also the bane of many a computer - bound drone 's existence			1
read on for five ways you 're potentially leading your co-workers , friends and casual acquaintances to hit " @entity71			1
" you 're a downer you : hi ... your friend : heyo			1
you : i 'm really depressed			1
your friend : um , why ? you : well , my boss yelled at me because i would n't take my headphones off , but i was listening to this really get - up - and - go jam by the vaselines and it was really impelling me to get up and go , but he did n't get that			1
you : also my cat died this morning , but he 's somewhere in the wall because he climbed in there last week so i can only tell by the smell			2
you : also , that girl i had been seeing is n't returning my calls because the same cat peed all over her new silk dress			2
you : actually , since he 's dead , do you think that would be reason enough to call her again ? your friend : brb you 're dull you : hey			1
your friend : hi ! you : what 's up ? your friend : ehh , not much			2
my boss just spilled coffee all over his shirt and yelled , " fudge ! " it was pretty funny			2
who says , " fudge ! ' after age 7 ? you : ha			2
your friend : what 's up with you ? you : nothing			2
so what 's up ... ? you over-share you : @entity111 your friend : oh , cool			2

you : i 'm hiding from some people			0
what 's up ? your friend : well , i 've been e-mailing you for like the last hour about that project			0
are you done yet ? seriously , man , we need to turn it in tomorrow and you have n't done anything yet			0
can you send me what you have ? ? ? [ sent at 11:14 am on thursday ] your friend : hello ? ? ? [ sent at 11:52 am on thursday ] your friend : hello ? ? ? dude , you 're not fooling anyone			0
answer me ! you put up annoying statuses you : hey ... your friend : hey , lady			1
you : what 's going on ? [ your new status message - i hate my job and my life and everyone i know 11:19 am ] your friend : uh ... gtg .			0

thanks to online chatting , the internet has provided us with a splendid way to communicate
being a downer , dull or putting up annoying statuses can put at risk of being blocked
