-- the @entity1 on wednesday banned the sale of alcoholic energy drinks after a group of college students got sick from consuming a drink nicknamed " blackout in a can			1
" the ban , which takes effect november 18 , follows the october hospitalization of nine underage @entity13 students who said they got sick after drinking " @entity14 , " a caffeinated malt liquor			1
some of the students also mixed the canned drinks with other alcohol , including vodka , police reported			2
@entity22 state attorney general @entity21 has called for federal food regulators to ban the beverages , which he said " have such high levels of stimulants that people have no idea how inebriated they really are			0
" but @entity14 's manufacturer , @entity14 of @entity29 , @entity30 , said the drink is " just as safe as any other alcoholic beverage " when used responsibly			1
the company said it was " extremely disappointed " by the ban , which it said was " based on misguided information and does not address the issue at hand			1
" " if the true concern was to preserve the public health , safety , and general welfare , this ban would also address caffeinated liquor products , which contain three to four times as much alcohol as our products , " @entity39 said in a written statement			0
" instead , under this ban , these products will remain legal and accessible to the same subset of the population that chose not to consume our products responsibly , sold in stores where existing alcohol laws can continue to be ignored , and abused alongside the same types of alcohols and other illicit substances that contributed to the incident at @entity13 earlier this year			0
" the company called the @entity13 incident " disturbing and unacceptable , " but said the liquor board 's move does nothing to address the " ongoing challenge " of underage drinking among college students			0
and it said the board ignored its normal procedures , depriving affected businesses " any opportunity to be heard			0
" in an earlier statement , @entity39 said @entity14 has about the same amount of alcohol as wine or some craft beers and roughly the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee from the @entity85 chain			2
the incident that led to the ban took place in @entity89 , @entity22 , in early october			0
police concluded that none of the students was drugged or given alcohol without their knowledge , according to a school statement , but the findings convinced university president @entity97 to ban " alcohol energy drinks " from his campus			1
" we need to make sure that we 're sending a strong message to students about the dangers of alcohol energy drinks and we need to know more about the way it affects health and behavior , " @entity97 said			1
the drinks are " a binge - drinkers dream because the caffeine and other stimulants allow a drinker to ingest larger volumes of alcohol without passing out , " the chairman of the school 's physical education department said			1
" being able to feel the effects of tiredness , loss of coordination and even passing out or vomiting are the body 's defenses against consuming doses of alcohol that will kill you , " professor @entity120 said last month			2
" regardless , once the blood alcohol level reaches a certain level you can drop like a box of rocks			0
" @entity0 's @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
