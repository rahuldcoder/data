-- here are some of the most quotable sound bites from the sunday morning shows : on @entity5 predictions : " if we get 39 seats and take the majority , that 's success			1
if we get 37 seats , that 's success			2
... we have battled our way back here , so to have the kind of night that we 're anticipating on tuesday is not just a blessing , but it comes from the hard work of our candidates out there engaging with the people			0
" -- @entity21 chairman @entity20 , @entity0 's " @entity22 " " people are n't going to be voting for generic candidates on tuesday			1
they 'll be voting for actual candidates			1
and what i found as i traveled around is that in many of the states that i visited , when people listen to the candidates and know them and directly ask them questions and trust them , you get a much different outcome			0
" -- majority whip @entity34 , " @entity22 " " i do n't know what the headlines are going to be the day after the election			1
i do n't think there 's much doubt because of public opinion polls that @entity41 are going to take over control of the @entity43			1
that 's almost a foregone conclusion			0
i hope they wo n't get @entity47 as well , and i do n't think they will			2
but this , i think , may have some benefits in the long term			0
" -- former president @entity52 , @entity0 's " @entity53 " @entity52 : @entity55 forebears elected me " i think it 's going to be a political earthquake and the message will have been sent to the left that they blew it , and @entity62 are waking up and they 're saying , ' no , smaller , smarter government is the only way that the country can get back on the right track			2
' " -- former @entity67 gov. @entity66 , " @entity68 " " i think all these @entity70 pundits are going to be surprised , just like many of them were surprised very recently in a special election that we had in @entity74 , where everybody predicted the @entity21 win			1
we 're seeing strong early votes for @entity79 , which means that this idea that the @entity79 are not energized is just not true			0
" -- @entity79 rep. @entity81 , " @entity68 " " i 'll be surprised if the @entity43 does n't have a @entity21 majority			1
i think it 's harder in the @entity47			0
i think we 'll probably make big gains in the @entity47			2
and of course for my particular line of work , i think we 'll have at least 30 @entity21 governors			1
" -- @entity90 gov. @entity90 of @entity91 , @entity93 's " @entity92 " " despite @entity41 ' assertions ' oh , there 's an enthusiasm gap ! ' we 're seeing strong @entity79 performance in early voting and we 're seeing significant turnout all over the country that the field efforts are kicking			1
and we 're seeing polls , the poll today that i saw shows that if you just ask registereds , @entity79 have an edge over @entity41 this time			1
likely , they still have an edge by about four points			0
that 's what we 've got to do between now and tuesday			0
if our voters turn out , we win			1
" -- @entity114 chairman @entity113 , " @entity92 " " we understand that people are hurting in this country			1
but our goal is to have them understand and channel their anger on @entity5 against the @entity41 that brought us to the verge of economic collapse in november of 2008 , when financial institutions in this country were ready to collapse			1
" -- @entity79 sen. @entity124 , @entity126 's " @entity125 " " i think we 'll make a lot of headway			1
i 'm not predicting that we will get the [ @entity47 ] majority this cycle			2
i think it probably is going to take two cycles , but there is certainly a potential there , depending on just how high and how broad this wave election is			2
" -- @entity21 sen. @entity137 , " @entity125 " " i think the seats that we 're going to win , if we do win them , it 's going to be because we 're pledged to cut back on spending			1
if we ever reneged on that pledge , then we just look like another group of politicians coming in			0
we have to make this year different from others			0
" -- @entity41 rep. @entity41 , @entity148 's " @entity147 " " i 've been out campaigning the last couple of weeks			1
i 've sensed that if this is a @entity21 tidal wave , i 've sensed a @entity79 undertow going against it			1
@entity79 are much more fired up in the last two weeks than people would think			0
" -- @entity79 gov. @entity153 of @entity74 , " @entity147 " " i feel good about the @entity47 right now in terms of what 's going to happen at the end of this election			1
i think people have just stepped back a little and said , we want to continue to govern and move forward			0
and we 're concerned about the extreme views of some of these candidates			0
" -- @entity79 sen. @entity163 , " @entity147 " on what the election says about president @entity165 : " there 's no question that this midterm election is a referendum on @entity165 's policies			1
the public talks about it			0
the dominant issues in @entity62 are all of this spending , outrageous spending , excessive debt , skyrocketing deficits , joblessness and what the @entity62 people are looking at , and they 're saying the @entity165 policies are n't working			2
" -- @entity90 , " @entity92 " " i think this is a choice , a clear choice			1
it 's not a referendum			0
it 's a choice between a @entity79 that is doing heavy lifting to turn a shrinking economy that the @entity41 left us into a growing economy , stopping combat operations in @entity194 and so many other key achievements			1
" -- @entity113 , " @entity92 " " i do n't think it 's about communication			1
i think it 's about the product			0
they 're trying to sell something that is n't any good			2
and what we have now is an economy that remains in the doldrums			0
... so people are angry			0
they 're also worried about the future			0
and they 're saying this is not what we thought we were getting when we elected president @entity165 and the @entity213			0
" -- @entity214 gov. @entity214 of @entity215 , " @entity147 " on @entity20 's @entity41 detractors : " look , not everybody plays well with others on the playground			1
i 'm a different kind of chairman			2
i said i would be			0
i 'm not a status quo guy			1
i believe in shaking the system up			0
i 'm a grass - roots , bottom - up kind of activist			0
and i think the party needs that kind of leadership right now			0
the status quo , the establishment in @entity70 -- they 'll get used to me			1
" -- @entity20 , " @entity22 " on 2012 : " if the country needed me -- and i 'm not saying that the country does and that the country would ever necessarily want to choose me over anyone else , but i would be willing to make the sacrifices if need be for @entity62			1
" -- @entity66 , " @entity68 " on potential terror threats : " some very good work was done both overseas as well as here in the @entity62 to find those two packages and to make sure that those devices were made inert			2
very close in strong partnership there			0
so we do n't know whether or not that 's the extent of it , so we 're going to continue to pursue all possible leads in the event that there are some other devices that are out there			2
" -- @entity256 , @entity165 's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism , " @entity22 " @entity256 says cargo plane explosives could detonate on their own " so the underwear bomber , as well as these packages , are showing sort of new techniques on their part			2
they are very innovative and creative			0
we need to stay one step ahead of them			0
" -- @entity256 , " @entity125 "			2

dems , @entity41 both *optimistic* in final days before the election
" i 'll be surprised if the @entity43 does n't have a @entity21 majority , " @entity90 says
" if our voters turn out , we win , " says @entity114 chairman @entity113
" the status quo , the establishment in @entity70 -- they 'll get used to me , " @entity20 says
