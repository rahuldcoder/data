there 's been a lot of news over the past few days about the hacker collective @entity4			1
last friday , the group claimed to have posted an internal @entity7 conference call discussing investigations into @entity4 and the @entity7 acknowledged the call was intended to be private			1
this week , @entity4 posted e-mails that it claims are from an adviser to the @entity13 president , suggesting how @entity14 could downplay violence in the country when he was interviewed by @entity17 last summer			1
so who is @entity4 ? consider its motto : " we are @entity21			1
" in strict @entity24 terms , legion means a group of fighters , a faceless army more powerful as a whole than each individual			0
still maddeningly vague enough for you ? that 's the point			0
@entity4 takes great pains to be undefinable and amorphous			1
because its members are impossible to isolate as a single thing , they 've been called pranksters and criminals			0
some have dismissed them as nerds with too much free time			0
there are others , though , who contend @entity4 is the future form of internet - based social activism			1
they laud the " hactivists " for their actions			0
@entity49 has called @entity4 a culture , complete with its own " aesthetics and values , art and literature , social norms and ways of production , and even its own dialectic language			1
" as for the literal operation of @entity4 , becoming part of it is as simple as going onto its @entity62 forums and typing away			1
there are numerous @entity65 accounts which claim to be affiliated with @entity4 , and more websites that post and repost ( known as mirroring ) @entity4 content than there is room to mention here			1
the real - life people involved in @entity4 could be behind their laptops anywhere , from an internet caf√© in @entity74 to a @entity76 suburb			2
@entity4 appears to have no spokesperson or leader			1
one could participate for a minute or a day in a chat room , and then never go back again			0
it is poor etiquette to ask in a chat forum for real names or identifying information behind someone 's @entity87 handle			0
you just trust that the others ' intentions , for the most part , are to serve the whole			0
online discussions can eventually wind toward a " vote " on whether to go after a target , which anyone in the chat can suggest , according to @entity99 , a @entity100 web developer who 's tried to explain @entity4 on many media outlets , including @entity102			2
he says he 's not a spokesperson for @entity4 and that he merely observes anonymous chats but does n't participate in its activities			1
" if the group at that given time decides to go after a website and take it down , then that happens , " he said			0
" if the majority of the people chatting disagree and make their case , then it wo n't happen			0
" it 's an uphill battle verifying information for stories about @entity4			2
law enforcement is in an equally tricky spot when pursuing @entity4 participants if authorities believe they have violated the law			2
there have been several arrests involving alleged @entity4 members , several of them teenagers			2
over the past two years , @entity4 has been known primarily for attacks called @entity127 , short for distributed denial of service , a kind of network stress test in which each attacker gives consent to have his or her computer linked to a bot net			2
the force of all those computers working together , focused on one site , overwhelms the targeted site 's server and consequently disrupts or takes the site down			0
@entity143 is the @entity62 equivalent of standing behind a much bigger guy in a fight that you 've started because you could never win the fight alone			0
@entity4 most recently claimed to take offline sites belonging to the @entity7 and the @entity152 @entity151 after an announcement that @entity155 fans were arrested			1
( what is @entity155 ? ) @entity127 attacks made @entity4 famous in 2010 when it targeted the sites of @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
@entity4 claimed online that it was lashing out at the corporations because they had stopped doing business with @entity164			2
in 2010 , @entity164 leaked hundreds of thousands of classified @entity152 intelligence documents on the wars in @entity168 and @entity169 , as well nearly a quarter million @entity171 cables			2
@entity164 editor and founder @entity172 said at the time that he had no affiliation with @entity4 and nothing to do with the attacks			0
since then @entity4 has branched out across the world , or at least caught the attention of hackers everywhere			1
in november , it claimed in an online video to have obtained information about people in @entity183 who were leading double lives as drug cartel helpers			0
@entity4 never released that information , yet by that time the sensational claim itself had drawn a huge amount of media attention to the group			1
@entity4 grabbed many other headlines in 2011 , notably claiming that it attacked government websites in @entity192 and @entity193 as a way to show support for protesters during @entity198 uprisings			1
a video -- laced with @entity4 ' typical computer - voiceover -- appeared online during the january 2011 revolution			0
it threatened @entity193 authorities if they attempted to censor internet access and other freedoms			0
you will not be denied your right to free speech , free press , free association and your universal right to freely access information both in real life and on the @entity62 , " the voice said			0
@entity4 had a hand in organizing and agitating in the @entity216 throughout 2011			0
protesters have been seen at occupy demonstrations across the globe wearing @entity4 ' distinctive @entity221 mask , the same icon that appeared this week on sites carrying the alleged e-mails related to @entity13 .			1

@entity4 is an amorphous collective of hackers that are hard to define
anyone can be a member and the group has no spokesperson
@entity4 has been making headlines since 2010 , most recently attacking the @entity7
the group claims to have leaked e-mails related to the @entity13 president
