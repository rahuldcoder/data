@entity0 , @entity1 -- i am and always will be completely against any food that has been altered genetically for human consumption			0
and never , in the 30 - plus years i have been a restaurant chef , has one customer requested a genetically modified organism for dinner			1
this is why i was alarmed to learn early this month that the @entity10 announced with " reasonable certainty " that a new genetically modified @entity13 salmon awaiting approval posed " no harm " to humans who might soon have the opportunity to buy it and eat it as though it were a fish from nature			1
the announcement brings this " frankenfish " one step closer to your table			0
the creation of this fish is just another tactic for big industry to make bigger , faster profits with no consideration for the impact it will have on our personal health and the health of our environment and ecosystem			2
the fish , an @entity13 salmon , contains growth hormone from a @entity43 species , the @entity45 salmon , as well as genetic material from another species , the ocean pout , that causes the " transgenic " salmon to grow at twice the normal speed			2
the claim made by its developer , @entity53 , is that this altered fish is as safe to consume as farmed @entity13 salmon			1
this argument does n't convince much , since farmed salmon are n't really that safe to eat			1
they have been found to have higher concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls than wild salmon , which gets into their bodies from the concentrated fish meal used to create their feed			2
@entity53 also plans to sell the eggs of its fish to fish farms			0
as we have learned over time , farmed @entity13 salmon is horrible for the environment			2
the fish are grown in overcrowded , open - net pens in the ocean , placing an unnatural stress on the surrounding ocean environment as well as on the fish themselves			2
in those conditions it becomes necessary to use antibiotics on an already unstable fish in order to control bacterial infections and other diseases -- and to protect the investment of carnivorous fish farming			2
the byproducts of all this -- a wonderful stew of feces , unconsumed fish food and dead fish called , sweetly , " effluent " -- create a suffocating blanket that spreads across the ocean floor , resulting in a massive dead zone surrounding the farming area			2
it kills clams , oysters , eel grasses -- where young fish feed and grow -- and more			0
if the point of genetically engineering fish is to produce more salmon faster , introducing these fish into the fish farm scenario will only magnify an already big problem			1
and it will create a larger demand for smaller species of wild fish to be used for fish feed necessary to support these constantly feeding frankenfish			0
wild species do n't stand a chance			0
it has also been proven that escapes from fish farms into the natural population are inevitable			0
these transgenic fish have a voracious appetite that has no regard for season or feeding cycle			0
what could happen ? well , estimates of farmed salmon escapes in @entity130 from 1991 to 2001 total at least 400,000 fish			1
the wild salmon population is already severely endangered			0
if escaped , the farmed -- and now free - swimming aggressive gluttons -- will compete for the food that is essential for wild stocks to survive , further threatening this already endangered species ( nearly all @entity13 salmon sold now comes from fish farms )			1
what process has the @entity10 used to determine whether the genetically modified fish is safe for human health and the environment ? we did not know during most of the agency 's evaluation process			1
@entity10 regulations allow genetically modified animals to be evaluated under the same rules as veterinary pharmaceuticals			1
so the information given to the agency by the applicant is confidential ; in the case of this fish , the information was not posted on the @entity10 website until the announcement on safety was made in early september			1
the @entity10 will hold a public meeting on february 21 to discuss how the fish should be labeled			1
i do n't trust this fish			0
it is an overweight fish being introduced to an already obese society			0
protecting a greedy company 's " confidential information " should not be acceptable when you are introducing the first genetically modified animal for human consumption into the marketplace			1
and i 'm terrified to consider that rules are being considered that would allow this fish to be created and then distributed without any kind of mandatory label stating that it is a genetically modified product			1
in restaurants , chefs are in a position to assure their guests that the food being served to them is not only delicious but also wholesome and safe to consume			0
how do we do this when there is no required labeling indicating that a fish has been manufactured by science and not a product of nature ? if these genetically engineered salmon are approved , it will set a worldwide precedent			1
it will open the door to other kinds of genetically modified animal foods that may pose health or environmental dangers , and the true extent of these might not reveal themselves for years to come			1
at the very least , given the amount of data that we have seen to date , the creation of these frankenfish for mass consumption should not be approved			0
it 's simply against nature and is a huge step back in the worldwide movement to eat local , organic and sustainably			0
bon app√©tit -- enjoy your dinner			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0

chef @entity217 opposes genetically modified organisms for public table
@entity10 set to ok modified salmon that its developer says is as safe as farmed salmon , he says
but farming already a health , *pollution* problem , he says ; fast - growing fish *compounds* it
@entity217 : approval with no required labels would set back *sustainability* movement
