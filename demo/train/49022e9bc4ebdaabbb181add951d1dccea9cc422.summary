-- a @entity2 judge on thursday dismissed one of three lawsuits challenging the state 's controversial collective bargaining law			1
circuit judge @entity10 dismissed the suit filed by @entity12 and two officials , county executive @entity7 and @entity9 chair @entity8 , saying the county lacks legal standing to assert constitutional claims against the state			1
" under longstanding @entity2 law , an agency or arm of government lacks authority to challenge the constitutionality of state statutes , " @entity10 wrote			1
however , she indicated that @entity25 and @entity8 may continue the suit as individuals and taxpayers			0
" the judge 's decision today states only the district attorney or the attorney general can sue the state to enforce the open meetings law , " @entity25 said in a prepared statement			1
" it 's for this reason that i was among the first of several officials to file formal complaints with the district attorney and attorney general the very day after legislative @entity43 broke open meetings laws			0
i applaud ( @entity12 ) district attorney ( ismael ) ozanne for taking up this issue			2
" sumi in late march stopped the law from taking effect so she could hear one of the other two suits -- filed by @entity53 who said they were not given enough time to vote on the law they were fighting			2
@entity58 would curb the collective bargaining rights of most state employees			1
the @entity53 ' suit , filed by @entity62 , alleges that @entity43 legislators violated the state 's open meetings law by calling a committee meeting to amend @entity43 gov. @entity68 's budget bill without providing the public with the necessary 24 - hour advance notice			1
state democrats said they were given only two hours notice for a vote			0
the amended bill , which had been stalled for weeks by 14 @entity53 state senators who left @entity2 to prevent a quorum -- and thus a vote on the measure -- then sailed through an easy full state @entity79 vote on march 9			0
the state @entity81 then passed the bill , and @entity68 signed it into law on march 11			0
the public brouhaha over @entity68 's $ 137 million budget repair bill all but shut down the @entity86 for weeks			0
it also drew protesters by the tens of thousands , among them union supporters and public employees , who called the proposed measure an attack on workers			0
" while the judge ruled the county is n't the proper jurisdiction to file this suit , her ruling does n't affect her outstanding restraining order in the district attorney 's case that blocks implementation of the legislation that eliminates the rights of public workers , " @entity25 's statement said			2
" her decision also does n't dismiss the questions of open meetings and quorum violations			0
... it just says @entity12 is n't the proper entity to sue the state over those violations , " @entity25 said .			1

judge @entity10 said @entity12 lacks standing to sue
she has put the law on hold and will hear another suit
the law curbs the collective bargaining rights of most state employees
