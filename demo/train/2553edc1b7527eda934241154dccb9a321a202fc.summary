flashback to february , president @entity14 's @entity16 address			0
@entity1 was abuzz about what appeared to be a salacious social media blunder : during the speech -- the bachelor congressman tweeted " @entity23 " for ' @entity21 ' to an attractive young blonde			2
@entity4 , 64 , announced that aspiring model @entity24 was actually his daughter , something he learned from her mother , an old girlfriend he had recently contacted			1
" i could n't sleep one night and i googled her and it came out that she had a bio written up on her webpage and it said she had a daughter @entity31			2
so i facebooked , searched her daughter and it turns out she had this daughter born on the 22nd of april in ' 88 and that was kind of when we were together , " said @entity4			1
@entity4 says his old flame told him that her daughter looked like him			1

" she said that she did n't know who her biological father was , and for her mental health she needed it			0
i had avoided it but i would do anything for her , " said @entity4			1

he still keeps pictures of her on his walls at the office , and at home			0
for him the short three - year period he thought @entity31 was his daughter was enough to cement his love for her			2
