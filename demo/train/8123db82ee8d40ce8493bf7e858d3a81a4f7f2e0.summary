@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 is the last of the @entity5 kingdoms			1
the small country is situated in the nooks and crannies of the highest mountain range on earth			2
it 's a special place that did n't have paved roads until the 1960s , was off - limits to foreign tourists until the 1970 's , and did n't have television until 1999 , the last country in the world to get service			1
the altitude and scenery are enough to take your breath away			0
in this country the environment is cherished			2
the kingdom lists environmental protection as one of the four pillars of happiness , a state of mind the country takes so seriously that " gross national happiness " is considered more important than gross domestic product			1
still , @entity1 is modernizing and looking at how to use its resources responsibly			1
water is one of its most abundant resources			0
" some people tell me that it 's the ' moving gold , ' " @entity39 , the executive engineer for @entity40 in @entity0 , said			2
" since the river patterns in @entity1 are naturally designed in such a way that it can produce huge amount of energy -- that is also clean energy			1
" @entity1 is tapping into that clean energy on a massive scale			1
hydropower is the sole source of electricity in the country and experts say the country is only using about 5 percent of its potential right now			1
" after 2020 we have a target of accomplishing 15 additional power plants and 3 are already under construction and they have achieved good progress , " @entity58 said			2
@entity1 's very first hydropower plant was set up in @entity0 , about a two - hour drive from the capital @entity68			1
the dam that harnesses the water is a spectacle in and of itself			0
it is beautifully painted with @entity74 deities , including the water goddess			0
even in the belly of the plant , the most utilitarian space has a wall covered with a colorfully painted mural depicting the life of @entity82			0
the mural adds beauty to what would normally be quite drab and dank			0
in @entity1 hydroelectricity has become big business ; actually , the biggest business			1
the clean energy created in this small country ( it 's about the size of @entity90 with a population less than that of @entity93 ) is being sold to one of @entity1 's power - starved and highly populated neighbors : @entity96			1
" more than 60 percent of our gdp comes from hydro - power , " @entity1 's prime minister @entity97 told @entity2			1
he says the clean energy business is a perfect fit for the country			2
" @entity1 is ecologically a very fragile region , being located in the vulnerable @entity5			1
and in fact , even with respect to hydropower , we are engaging in its realization only because it is ecologically friendly , these are all run - of - the river schemes with minimum or no damage to the ecology , " the prime minister said			1
government adviser @entity117 worries too many dams may harm the creatures that live in the water			0
" it 's a shame that so much of our rivers are being tapped			2
[ but ] it happens so quickly			0
i thought that , perhaps , we might be able to leave some of our rivers , still pristine with its natural beauty instead of damming them all , " @entity117 said			0
still , @entity117 is well aware of all the benefits from an energy source that does n't pollute the air			2
eighty percent of the country now has electricity and the goal is to have the entire nation electrified by 2013 , all of it provided by hydropower			1
the clean energy has changed many lives in @entity1			1
@entity142 , who uses only one name that is typical in the country , got electricity for the first time in 2000			1
" earlier , when electricity was n't there , we faced a lot of problems			2
we had to depend on firewood for everything			0
everything was dark , back then , " @entity142 said			0
electricity has helped increase the family income too			0
earlier , after backbreaking work harvesting rice in the fields , the family would have to spend their days beating the husks off the rice			0
now @entity142 flicks a switch and the electrical machine does the de-husking , making work more efficient and faster			0
she says she does n't know how the electricity is made but she is thankful for it			0
in fact , many of the people benefiting from hydropower have no idea that the pristine water in their rivers is generating the lights in their homes and businesses			0
when we told @entity142 that running water was helping create the electricity in her home her eye opened wide and she said : " we did n't know that water could produce electricity			0

hydropower is the sole source of electricity in @entity1
the kingdom lists environmental protection as one of the four pillars of happiness
" more than 60 percent of our gdp comes from hydro - power , " said @entity1 's *pm*
experts say the country is only using about 5 percent of its potential right now
