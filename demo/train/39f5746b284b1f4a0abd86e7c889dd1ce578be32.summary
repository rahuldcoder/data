@entity0 -- in 2011 @entity3 business secretary @entity2 lamented that a bunch of " right - wing nutters " was holding the @entity7 government and the world economy to ransom by refusing to agree the usually routine increase in @entity11 's legal debt limit			1
world leaders might avoid the blunt description used by @entity2 but their thoughts are probably very similar			0
the @entity7 is , once again , having another political gunfight over public funding and debt issues			1
internationally , @entity11 's fiscal shenanigans could be particularly harmful for eurozone countries trying to get their own public debt problems under control and strengthen their economic recovery			1
instability in the world money markets is the last thing that the likes of @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and even @entity30 need			1
and with the @entity3 economy excessively dependent on its financial sector , the storms in @entity32 could turn into a tempest for the @entity36			0
if the @entity7 imbroglio results in a debt default next month , it will serve as a very bad example to eurozone countries undergoing austerity to remedy their indebtedness			1

nothing new there is nothing new in the standoff between the @entity60 and the @entity62 @entity61 over agreeing a budget to fund government operations for the 2014 fiscal year , beginning october 1			0
whether single party controlled or not , @entity66 has failed to pass a budget by the start of the new fiscal year annually since 1994			0
however , it has always approved a @entity72 to fund government operations until a budget is agreed			0
if this is not settled by midnight today , the @entity7 government will experience a partial shutdown that will hit " non-essential services " ( including federal payment of government contracts , social security benefits and the like )			1
there have been ten such shutdowns since 1981			0
all but one of these only lasted a weekend when most government offices were closed anyway			0
the exception , in late 1995 - early 1996 , went on for 26 days			0

all this may look like a local infighting but the possible consequences could be global in scope if the stand - off continues until mid-october , when the @entity7 is scheduled to raise its debt limit			1
the ceiling for borrowing was actually reached last may			0
the @entity109 has been shuffling money from government accounts to pay @entity11 's creditors ever since , but the pot is now close to empty			2
the @entity7 is looking down the barrel at the first default in its history			2
if this happens , the very least of the consequences will be a reduction of its credit rating by @entity123 's ratings agency , along with others			0
the fact that @entity7 government creditors are mainly foreign governments and central banks may prevent panic on the money markets , but there will still be serious repercussions and dislocations stretching throughout @entity134 , @entity50 , and @entity11			1
global money flows even with a brief default , the @entity7 government will probably find it more difficult thereafter to sell short - term treasury notes at low interest to fund its operations			1
the likely consequence of this would be greater reliance on medium - term and long - term borrowing that could require higher interest rates to be attractive			0
read more : what happens at the @entity149 ? at a time when the @entity152 is still operating an easy money policy to boost recovery from the @entity155 , it may have to raise interest rates contrary to its expansionary preferences , with harmful consequences for the @entity7 and global economies			1
if @entity7 interests rate interest rates go up , @entity11 could become a magnet for global capital , leaving the @entity50 countries , in particular , short of credit needed to sustain their own economic recovery			1
the more likely scenario is that a default will be avoided , but the fear that one was imminent and the worry that it could easily happen again this time next year is bound to make the money markets nervous			1
foreign creditors willingly lend to the @entity7 because it is a safe bet in an uncertain world			2
but if its dysfunctional politics makes it look unsafe , they may look elsewhere			2
the @entity7 is fortunate that the euro is not a reserve currency in waiting , as it looked a decade ago , and the @entity185 renminbi is nowhere near ready to challenge the dollar			2
but what the world needs now is more certainty from its largest borrower and owner of its reserve currency			2
without this , there could be very damaging repercussions for global economic growth .			0

the @entity7 is facing up to yet another battle over its public funding and debt
@entity202 says this is nothing new -- but its impact on international markets is a worry
money markets will get nervous at the continued dysfunction in @entity7 politics
the eurozone is only just emerging from *recession* and certainty is needed
