-- a previously unheard recording of @entity2 discussing @entity3 will be played monday in the place where the civil rights leader was assassinated			1
@entity2 's comments are on a 53 - year - old reel - to - reel tape discovered in a @entity9 attic several years ago			1
but the last several minutes are only now being made public			0
the civil rights leader is heard discussing @entity3 's role in securing his release from a @entity14 prison after he was sentenced to four months of hard labor for a traffic violation two weeks before the election that sent @entity3 to the @entity18			1
then - sen. @entity3 placed a call to @entity20 against the advice of close advisers , expressing his concern to @entity2 's wife			1
his brother , @entity25 also called the @entity14 judge who had sentenced @entity2 to the chain gang and denied him bond			0
@entity2 was freed the next day			2
@entity2 interview found in @entity9 attic the interviewer asked dr. @entity2 if he thought @entity3 had any influence on his release			1
" well , i would say first that many forces worked together to bring about my release , " @entity2 said			0
" i do n't think any one force brought it about , but you had a plurality of forces working together			0
i 'm sure that the interest of the public , in general , all over @entity42 had something , a great deal to do with it			0
" in fact , @entity49 mayor @entity48 was working to negotiate @entity2 's release from incarceration , which began with his arrest during a protest eight days earlier , according to @entity56 's historical account in his book , " parting the @entity58			2
" " now , it is true that sen. @entity3 did take a specific step , " @entity2 said			1
" he was in contact with officials in @entity14 during my arrest and he called my wife , made a personal call and expressed his concern and said to her that he was working and trying to do something to make my release possible			0
" @entity3 made the call to @entity2 's wife at the urging of his brother - in - law @entity72 , but out of the presence of campaigns aides who were concerned it could cost him southern support in the election 13 days away , @entity56 wrote			1
a special class with @entity2 @entity25 , who was initially upset when he found out about the call , reversed himself later that day and placed his own call to the judge , @entity56 wrote			2
@entity2 told the interviewer he thought it had " some part " in his release			0
" his brother , who at that time was his campaign manager , also made direct contact with officials and even a judge in @entity14 , so the @entity3 family did have some part , at least they expressed a concern and they did have some part in the release , but i must make it clear that many other forces worked to bring it about also			2
" the @entity101 ' intervention is credited with shifting support of black voters in crucial northern states to the @entity3 side and away from @entity106 , whose campaign only offered a " no comment " when asked about the civil rights leader 's imprisonment			1
the recording is from an interview conducted on december 21 , 1960 , in @entity113 , @entity9 , by a man who intended to write a book about the civil rights movement			1
he never finished the book and the tape was lost until the man 's son rediscovered it five decades later while rummaging through dilapidated boxes left there by his father			1
the first five minutes , in which @entity2 discusses his definition of nonviolence and its importance in the civil rights movement , was made public in 2012			1
" i would ... say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end through moral means , " he said			0
" and it grows out of the whole concept of love , because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving spirit , he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves the opponent			0
" @entity2 continued , " i am convinced that when the history books are written in future years , historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our heritage , " he said			0
" it represents struggle on the highest level of dignity and discipline			0
" in another part of the recording , @entity2 describes his visit to @entity155 and the importance of the civil rights movement in the @entity42 and abroad			1
@entity3 @entity18 had jitters ahead of 1963 march on @entity159 " there is quite a bit of interest and concern in @entity164 for the situation in the @entity42			2
@entity164 leaders in general , and @entity164 people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and familiar with what has taken place , " he said , " we must solve this problem of racial injustice if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world , and if we expect to maintain a moral voice in a world that is two - thirds color			0
" @entity179 , a collector and expert on rare historical artifacts , brokered its sale to illusionist @entity184 , who then donated the tape to the @entity186 , which is housed in the @entity186 in @entity187			1
@entity2 was shot to death standing on a balcony of the @entity187 , motel on april 4 , 1968			0
the entire recording will be played monday in the last room where the civil rights leader slept			1
" when i heard it , i got goose bumps all over , " @entity179 said , " it feels like he 's sitting in your living room and talking to you			2
" " it gave me chills , " @entity184 told @entity0 in september 2012 , when he bought the tape for an undisclosed amount			1
it was striking because the recording revealed @entity2 in a relaxed mood , he said			2
" we 've heard dr. @entity2 talk about peaceful change in the public forum , but this is an audio tape of him talking conversationally , " he said			2
" i 'm certainly no expert , but it 's the first time i 've ever heard him in that context and i was very moved by it			0
" @entity184 said he gave the recording to the museum because it " is just the right thing to do			1
" " he 's certainly one of the great inspirational figures in history , " @entity184 said			1
" so much of what i do , in my own little way , is making people dream , transporting them , making them think differently			0
that 's what magic does			0
his dream was far greater than any entertainer can provide			0
" the greatest @entity2 speeches you never heard			0
