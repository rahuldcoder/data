well , make that two			0
if you remember , the outspoken comedian was selected as the school 's 2014 fall commencement speaker , until students incensed by his anti-religious comments -- particularly his views on @entity12 -- started a petition to have him removed			1
on tuesday night , the student group that 's tasked with selecting commencement speakers met and voted to withdraw @entity2 's invitation			1
that would have been the end of the matter except the very next day , the college said it wo n't honor the vote			1
" this university has not in the past and will not in the future shy away from hosting speakers who some deem provocative , " the school said			0
the disinvitation the student group is called the @entity30			1
it 's a committee of undergrads whose role is to come up with graduation speakers			0
in august , the @entity30 selected @entity2			1
on tuesday , it decided to unselect him			0
but the college says the tuesday night meeting was held without administration participation			1
" the @entity3 administration can not and will not accept this decision , which appears to have been based solely on mr. @entity2 's opinions and beliefs , which he conveyed through constitutionally protected speech , " the school said in a statement			1
it added that the school 's decision should n't be taken as an endorsement of @entity2 's views			1
" indeed , the administration 's position on mr. @entity2 's opinions and perspectives is irrelevant in this context			1
" as so , it said , the invitation stands ; @entity2 will speak at the december event			2
the reaction the @entity59 expressed disappointment at the college 's ruling , saying it disrespected students " by casting aside the long - standing process for selecting commencement speakers and instead imposing its own will			2
" while mr. @entity2 has the right to speak whenever and wherever he likes , he does not have the right to have his hate - filled views honored and tacitly endorsed by a prestigious university , " said @entity67 , of the group 's @entity69 chapter			1
for his part , @entity2 's keeping mum			1
" every news outlet asking me 4 comment on this @entity80 thing but then i remembered : i 've got a show ! and thats where i 'll address it , @entity84 , " he tweeted			0
the controversy meanwhile , the petition on @entity87 that started the back - and - forth continues to draws signatures			0
by early wednesday morning , 4,100 had signed on			0
" @entity2 is a blatant bigot and racist who has no respect for the values @entity3 students and administration stand for , " the petition says			2
" in a time where climate is a priority for all on campus , we can not invite an individual who himself perpetuates a dangerous learning environment			0
" the petition points to recent episodes of @entity2 's @entity109 show " @entity111 " as an example			2
( @entity109 , like @entity0 , is a division of @entity112			0
) " @entity12 is the only religion that acts like the mafia that will f * * * ing kill you if you say the wrong thing , " @entity2 said during one episode , which is cited on the students ' petition as an example of @entity2 's " hate speech			2
" this is n't the only petition on the site about @entity2			0
several have called for his firing from " @entity111 , " though they do n't seem to have garnered much traction			0
@entity2 has been on the show for 12 years and has become known for his controversial statements on a wide range of topics			0
