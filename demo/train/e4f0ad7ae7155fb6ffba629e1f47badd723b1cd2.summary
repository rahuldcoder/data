-- a patent application filed by @entity2 reveals an interesting possible development of @entity5 's @entity4 , which may get a display of its own down the road			1
@entity0 : the 9 most important tablet mysteries of 2012 the application , originally filed in august 2011 and made public thursday , describes " thin flexible display technology " which can be integrated into the cover			0
this secondary display , @entity2 believes , would " greatly enhance " the overall functionality of the tablet			2
@entity0 : @entity17 stock price drops below $ 20 the concept opens up a lot of possibilities			0
the secondary display , as described in @entity2 's patent application , could simply display notifications related to what 's happening on the @entity5 ( the name of the movie currently playing , for example )			1
it could also be a full - fledged companion to the main screen , sporting a virtual keyboard or another set of application icons			0
@entity0 : if the @entity33 were a galaxy it would look like this of course , the patent application does n't mean this concept will ever become a real product , but it 's interesting to see that @entity2 is entertaining the idea			1
what do you think : would a secondary display be a useful addition to the @entity4 ? share your thoughts in the comments			0

@entity2 files patent *hinting* at an @entity51 display , meaning two work surfaces
display creates *ability* to use cover for *messaging* , movies , icon space , drawing and more
display could also *include* a *digital* keyboard
filing a patent does not mean the cover will ever become a real product
