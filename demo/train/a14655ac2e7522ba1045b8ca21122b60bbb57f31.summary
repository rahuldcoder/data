the tangled @entity1 scandal highlights how easily the @entity3 government can access citizens ' private e-mails			1
the @entity7 's request to access @entity10 's personal @entity9 account was one of 7,969 similar requests @entity13 received from the @entity3 government in the first half of 2012 , according to @entity13 and news reports			1
the company said it complied with the requests , either fully or partially , 90 % of the time			0
according to the latest @entity20 report , @entity13 fielded 20,938 requests for private account data from governments around the world between january and june of this year			1
that 's up from 18,257 such requests during the last half of 2011 , the company said			2
" one trend has become clear : government surveillance is on the rise , " @entity30 , a @entity13 senior policy analyst , writes in the blog post announcing the latest report -- the sixth @entity13 has released in the last three years			2
@entity13 stores huge amounts of data and personal information about its users			1
in addition to the wealth of information in e-mail and @entity45 accounts , the company also has users ' ip addresses , which can be used to determine locations			0
beginning in may of this year , the @entity7 accessed @entity9 accounts used by @entity10 to communicate with @entity1 , the former @entity50 director , during their affair , according to a report in the @entity54			0
the bi-annual @entity56 report is @entity13 's attempt to " shine a light " on how often governments around the world ask to access user data as part of criminal investigations			1
the company also publishes data on how often government agencies request that public content be removed from @entity13 services , such as @entity70 videos or blog posts on @entity72			1
the most common reason cited for wanting content taken down is defamation			0
@entity3 law enforcement agencies seem to be the most curious			2
the country continues to top the list for the most requests for user data in the world , followed at a distance by @entity83			2
while @entity13 is admirably proactive about releasing data on government requests , in the majority of cases it does turn over the requested information			1
the company said it cooperates with @entity3 government requests more than any other country			1
outdated laws have created loopholes that allow government and law enforcement agencies to request information and conduct electronic surveillance without warrants			0
the piece of legislation at the heart of the issue is the @entity104 , passed in 1986			0
technology has changed radically in the past 25 years			0
e-mails , cellphones , location information and data stored on cloud services were n't considered when the original law was drafted			0
@entity13 is an active member of the @entity113 , which has been pushing for reform of the @entity104			1
the group 's members include @entity117 , @entity118 , the @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity13 and @entity121 along with a slew of other big - name tech companies and civil liberties groups			2
other technology companies , including @entity121 and @entity126 , are joining @entity13 and releasing their own transparency reports			0
the @entity128 is against any updates to the law that would require more warrants			0
revising the @entity104 would n't prohibit the government and law enforcement agencies from requesting the information , it would just require they go through an approval process to get the warrants			1
in a bit of circular logic , the @entity128 has argued that the electronic evidence gathered without warrants is necessary to build enough of a case to later get search warrants .			0

@entity13 's @entity144 shows increase in government requests for private data
@entity3 made 7,969 requests for users ' @entity13 data in the first six months of 2012
@entity13 pushing for an overhaul of the @entity104 law which allows *warrantless* data requests
