-- @entity3 authorities have called off a dive team 's search for the remains of @entity8 after two days of searching the waters off @entity3 proved fruitless , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 prosecutor said wednesday			1
the search was initiated after a @entity12 couple vacationing on the island told authorities that a picture they took last year while snorkeling looked like a skeleton			1
@entity3 police contacted the island 's tour companies and used a dive team to search the island 's snorkeling locations , said @entity23 , spokeswoman for the @entity3 prosecutor 's office			1
after searching sunday and wednesday , police " feel pretty confident " they scoured all areas typically used by snorkelers and found nothing that resembled the image depicted in the photograph , she said			0
" it 's a dead end , " she added			1
" we 're assuming the photo is of coral			1
" though no more dives are planned to follow up on the couple 's tip , @entity23 said the prosecutor 's office will continue " to follow every lead " in an attempt to determine what happened to @entity43 , an 18 - year - old @entity44 high school student who was on a graduation trip in may 2005 when she was last reported seen leaving a bar in the capital of @entity48			1
three months after snapping what she said she thought were pictures of " colorful fish , " @entity49 and her husband said they realized that one of the pictures depicted what appeared to be human remains			0
" when i looked at that photo , i said , ' by darn , that certainly does look like a skeleton , ' " @entity59 told @entity64 's " @entity63 " last week			1
the main suspect in the case , @entity65 , remains free			0
@entity65 has made alleged confession - like statements in tv interviews , one of which involves dumping @entity43 's body in the ocean after she suffered a seizure on the beach			2
@entity3 judges have ruled there is n't enough evidence to arrest him			1
@entity43 's mother , @entity81 , has declined to comment on the photo			2
the couple , who took the photo to police and the @entity86 , said it was taken near an old shipwreck			1
the @entity86 said it is investigating			0
whether the object in the photo is human remains is still up for debate			2
in underwater burials , it is typical for arms , legs and other extremities to be dispersed and for lighter bones to be carried away from heavier bones by fish , wildlife and water , according to @entity103 , a forensic anthropologist			2
" it looks as if there 's something that may be on top of the skeleton , " @entity103 said of the image in the photograph			0
" that would certainly bode well for preserving the center of the mass of the body and keeping most of it there			0
" but dr. @entity117 , a physician on the faculty at @entity119 and @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 , said he sees mixed signs , some indicating the image may not be a skeleton			0
" what i do n't like about the photo is , there 's no spinal cord or vertebral column , " he said			0
" in fact , below this roundish skull - type profile , you see a curvature which does n't really represent a normal spinal column			0
" @entity0 's @entity136 and @entity64 's @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
