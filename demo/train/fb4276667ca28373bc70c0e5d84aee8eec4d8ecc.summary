on a lifetime of travel ... i started to travel like this at the age of 15 so for me , it 's normal			1
some days you get tired and you feel " i want to stay at home a little bit more , " but it 's only the moment			1
later when i am in different places , normally i feel very well and happy and excited			0
see also : what the world spends on business travel on keeping family and friends close ... i normally have a group of good people around me and that helps a lot			1
be with the people that you feel comfortable with			0
when you travel around the world and you visit the same place every year , then you ( eventually ) feel a little bit like home in most of the places			2
on the perfect hotel room ... it 's important to have a good space in the room , especially for me because normally we have a lot of things in the room , a lot of racquets ( and ) i need the space for massage table			1
i like to feel that everything is completely clean			0
it 's important to feel that the bed is good ... for the back , for these kind of things			1
on co-owning a luxury hotel in @entity67 ... i am from an island , from @entity69 , so i know what things i really try to find when i visit a place			0
the views from the hotel to the beach , to the sea are very important to me			0
see also : creating the airport of the future all my life i lived in front of the sea and always try to find the right views ... to have the chance to watch the sea from every place			2
( also ) , when you are in a hotel in front of the sea , you need to relax			0
here ( at the @entity88 on the island of @entity90 ) is great in my opinion because even if the hotel is 100 % full , you do n't feel it			0
on packing light ... it depends how long will be the travel but this time ... for almost two months , i travel with three bags			1
normally i travel with around five to seven racquets , that 's all			2
( in a ) tennis bag always you put shoes , you put strings , grips , these kind of things that without we can not play tennis			2
on punctuality ... i am always late			0
i am relaxed always and at the end , the last moment , ( it 's ) tradition for me			2
on conquering nerves whilst in the air ... if the plane moves , some turbulence , i am nervous flyer			0
see also : tablets and @entity115 transform flights my hands start to sweat and i know to relax ( i have ) to listen to music , to try to watch some films			0
on travel superstitions ... i 'm only superstitious on the tennis court .			0
