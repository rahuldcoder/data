@entity0 -- a fortnight after @entity4 's @entity3 became the first @entity6 man to play in a grand slam final in the open era -- going down in straight sets to @entity11 's @entity10 at @entity12 -- he sat down with @entity1 in @entity0 to talk the @entity13 , his new - found stardom and the impact his new coach @entity16 has had on his game			1
to make that @entity13 final , you had to get past @entity20 in the semis			1
how did it feel to beat the world 's top player at a major ? it was amazing , also playing my best tennis			1
it 's my second time beating him , but it 's different in a grand slam			1
everybody 's trying to play 100 %			1
so when i beat ( world @entity36 @entity35 ) , @entity38 ( @entity38 , world no. 4 ) and @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , it was a great feeling			1
was there anything different about the way you approached that big match ? not so much			2
i do n't think i was feeling a lot of pressure , just ( taking ) one match at a time			2
i was really relaxed , but also really concentrating every match			2
even if the match was going three or four hours , i was still concentrating well , and that was the key			2
how has life changed since then ? not much			2
it was a little bit crazy in @entity4 , a lot of people came to the airport when i landed			1
but what i do is always the same			2
train hard , always play my tennis			2
maybe all the players look at me in a different way now			1
they may care a little more , they study what i do			2
you 're a hero in @entity4 since the @entity13 -- there were people saying they wanted to name their future children @entity65			1
how have you found that experience ? they always want to motivate me			2
the @entity13 was played completely at the opposite time , but they were cheering for me throughout the night and the early morning			1
when i was walking in the street ( in @entity4 ) these couple of days , they 'll say congratulations to me and it 's always a pleasure to feel something like that			1
the @entity4 people are n't too aggressive so they ( usually ) wo n't say too much -- but this time was different			1
they were trying to say hi to me and congratulate me			0
do you feel an extra sense of pressure to be representing the hopes of many @entity6 fans ? not too much			0
i always think to just play my tennis			0
i 'm very honored to be the number one player in @entity85			0
you see more junior or young guys coming up , and women are always there -- like @entity90 ... but not for men			0
so i hope i can get leadership and this will help for sure in @entity85 to go to finals in grand slams			0
i broke one of the goals			0
i think people can believe a little more that they can do it			0
you 've been coached by former @entity101 champion @entity16 since january			1
what changes has he made to your game ? he 's definitely helped my tennis			1
my tennis is really growing very strong and is a little more aggressive than before			1
i 'm trying to , ( with ) the short ball , step in a little more			0
more things to do than before , but it 's working really well			1
i spend more time with him on the court , more practice and more training -- that 's why i could play seven matches in the @entity13 , even though i played two ( that went to ) five sets			1
who is your tennis hero ? @entity122 is the one i respect the most			0
i always love to play him and also to watch his tennis			0
sometimes we do n't know what he does -- he does amazing things			0
i think a great serve , great strokes , everything is perfect			0
he does n't have many weaknesses			0
@entity135 is known to eat a lot of sushi , @entity20 is big on gluten - free food			1
do you have a special diet or a personal chef ? not yet			0
i try to eat a good balance -- a lot of carbs before the match , also vegetables , a lot of fruit			0
but i do n't really stress too much			0
sometimes , i eat whatever i want			0
i try to eat simple and good			0
what do you like to do with your time off the court ? i like to go shopping and i love to sleep			0
sometimes when i have an off day i 'll sleep to midday			0
i play golf sometimes and love to watch sport			0
your home prefecture in @entity4 , @entity157 , recently offered you an award in the wake of your @entity13 performance , but you turned it down			1
why was that ? it 's the second time they 've offered			1
it 's always a pleasure that they honor me like that -- but i think i 'm still on my way to my goal			1
it 's not like i 've done everything			1
i think there 's still more things to do and i 'm still young			1
so i think if i get maybe a grand slam i can receive that			0
do you see yourself winning a grand slam one day ? i think it 's getting close , because i was almost there			2
but i know how tough it is to get to the semis in grand slams			0
it 's still far away i think , but you know , i 'm in the top 10 right now and i think i can be there			2
i have enough power and talent to get to the final -- so i hope i can get there again some time .			2
