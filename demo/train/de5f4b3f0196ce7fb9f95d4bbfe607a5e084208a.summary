-- the answer to the question will now never be known -- for many football fans had been wondering how @entity5 's @entity4 would fare when taking on future employers @entity6 in saturday 's @entity8 final at @entity9			1
after both @entity14 teams booked their place in the final , supporters , journalists and former players had asked how the 20 - year - old would handle a situation whereby he had the chance to shatter @entity6 's @entity8 dream but such thoughts now lie idle			1
last month , it was announced the midfielder was joining @entity5 's biggest @entity25 rivals after the recently - crowned @entity14 champions activated his release clause with a bid of $ 47 million			1
the move was criticized by many @entity5 fans , disappointed that a player who had been developed by the club 's academy since the age of 8 was being lost so readily and by the timing of the news			1
the announcement came on the eve of the opening leg of @entity5 's @entity8 semifinal with @entity41 , which the 2012 @entity25 champions ultimately won 4 - 3 on aggregate to reach their first final in 16 years			1
@entity4 was highly influential in the first leg but tore his hamstring 14 minutes into @entity5 's 2 - 0 defeat in the return fixture at the @entity50 on april 30 -- a game that has proved to be his last for the club			1
" it was my big aim to play in the final and i have been working hard to reach that in the last few weeks , " @entity5 's website quoted the @entity14 international as saying on wednesday			1
" i am incredibly sorry that i ca n't help the team in this really important game			0
i have full confidence in the team and will of course be going to @entity61 to support the boys from the sidelines			0
" the attacking midfielder had maintained hopes of playing in @entity61 until tuesday , when he managed an hour of training in his first full session since april until an adverse reaction curtailed his dream -- and so perhaps his chances of repairing his damaged relationship with some fans			0
for while the absence of @entity5 's main playmaker represents a major tactical blow for coach @entity77 , it has been welcomed by a section of the club 's supporters			2
the intensity of feeling following the april announcement found some fans burning a replica of his @entity5 jersey in online videos and others labeling him ' @entity91 ' among other protests			2
when hosting @entity6 in a league match on may 4 that ended 1 - 1 , @entity5 fans unveiled a massive banner reading ' the quest for cash reveals how much heart you really have , get lost @entity101 '			1
" what you find on the internet is that some @entity5 fans are not that disappointed that @entity4 can not play , " said @entity102 , a sports journalist with @entity14 newspaper @entity103			1
" a lot of them never wanted to see him in a @entity5 jersey again as they no longer saw him as the club 's player after he signed for @entity6			2
" " he had grown up at @entity5 and was seen as a player wholly created by @entity5 , which is why they were so disappointed			0
" when the transfer was announced , the charismatic @entity77 revealed that @entity4 's departure had hinged on the fact that former @entity119 @entity118 , who will take charge of @entity6 after this season , had identified him as a key player			2
" the reason @entity4 is leaving ? he is the favorite transfer of @entity118 , " @entity77 told reporters			0
" so if it 's anyone 's fault , it 's mine			0
i can not make myself 15 centimeters smaller and learn @entity128			0
@entity4 wants to work with this extraordinary coach that is @entity118			0
" despite the apathy of some supporters , @entity5 - who finished runner - up to @entity6 in this season 's @entity14 championship -- will miss the creativity of a player with 12 league goals and 13 assists in both the @entity25 and @entity8 this season			1
" @entity4 's absence is a major problem in attack because they have to change some other things , " added @entity102			0
" perhaps @entity146 will take his position behind striker @entity148 , with @entity149 filling @entity146 ' usual position on the wing			0
" @entity5 are also waiting on the fitness of defender @entity153 , who is receiving intense treatment on the ankle he damaged in saturday 's surprise home defeat by @entity157			1
meanwhile , one of the players @entity4 will link up with next season says @entity6 must atone for final defeats to @entity162 in 2010 and to @entity163 in their own stadium last year			2
" we have to win for the fans , the club and the whole team , " said @entity165 , who joined the @entity167 club six years ago			0
" this is our third time , we have more experience , know what it means to play in a final , so it 's nothing new for us , everyone knows what they have to do and how we have to play against @entity5			2
" the defeat to @entity162 was hard , but the loss to @entity163 really hurt , it was a huge shock for everyone , " added the @entity178 winger .			0

@entity5 's @entity4 ruled out of saturday 's @entity8 final against @entity6
midfielder *alienated* some @entity5 fans by agreeing to move to @entity6 on 1 july
