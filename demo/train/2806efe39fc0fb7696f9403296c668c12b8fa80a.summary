@entity0 , @entity1 -- we could n't have traveled farther to see the same thing			1
we were returning to the @entity5 from @entity6 -- where every turn continues to unveil another human tragedy even six weeks after the january 12 earthquake -- when we were redirected to @entity1			1
an 8.8 - magnitude quake had struck the area around @entity1 's capital , a seismic event 800 times more powerful than the one in @entity6			1
getting there was half the story			2
we took off from @entity17 , @entity18 , knowing the airport in @entity20 was closed , so our aim was to get as close as we could			2
that set off a journey that would last 48 hours			0
we flew to @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , then began a very long drive through the @entity31 region of @entity32 , into @entity1 and north into the earthquake zone			1
we were followed by an enormous full moon and skimpy clouds that danced along the skyline			0
this region seems too lovely to be the scene of any tragedy			0
its tall green mountains peaked with whitecaps and broad lakes give way to fields and sparkly beaches			0
@entity47 had summer vacation until it was interrupted by this disaster			0
and it is , in a word , a disaster			0
@entity6 , with its death toll and great suffering , sets the bar very high right now for what you can call a tragedy			1
but there is nothing inconsequential about hundreds of people dying , crushed in their own homes or swept away by a frantic sea			1
@entity1 has had very powerful earthquakes before and is a modern and wealthy place compared with @entity6			1
but as we drove up through @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and other lovely farming towns , we saw chunks of roadway and roofs fallen away , fractured bridges , people camped in tents among their cows			1
every @entity1 we spoke to talked about how the previous earthquakes had pushed anyone with means to rebuild their homes or find new ones designed to withstand strong shaking			1
people here know what to do			2
but the sight of military convoys and ambulances told the story of what 8.8 can do			0
an ambulance driver in @entity70 said there had been dozens of aftershocks , many powerful enough to add to the rising toll of injured and dead in towns without many large structures			1
they were overwhelmed and being dispatched to @entity0 , where a large population and tall structures meant more severe injuries			0
there , we found looting and people walking the streets in search of water and gas			2
the largest buildings were missing entire walls , and glass had shorn off the sides			0
a light cold drizzle was getting everyone wet			0
the vacation period means a lot of young people are out being mochileros ( backpackers ) and are separated from families by distance and downed phone lines			2
they have heard the stories of beach towns swept away and houses upended and are hitching rides at gas stations , hoping to find a way to reunite			0
the aftershocks are like a rising tide here , a clear sign that this is not over , that the damage is not done			2
the farm stands and cottages of the back roads are crooked and empty ; the city centers look abandoned and on the brink			0
this country is not crying out for international assistance in the way @entity6 did			1
it was prepared and has coping resources			2
this is a place that sends rescue workers to other countries because they 're so good at it			0
yet its natural beauty and efficiency are not enough to diminish what connects these folks to @entity6 -- that the people waiting for buses beside the blackberry fields along @entity161 5 are running scared .			1

the quake that shook @entity1 was 800 times more powerful than the one that hit @entity6
country 's *infrastructure* built to withstand quakes , but death and destruction *inescapable*
reports : dozens of aftershocks powerful enough to add to toll of injured and dead
wealthier and more prepared than @entity6 , @entity1 and its people still share in the fear
