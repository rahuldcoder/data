-- what an upset ! before the first presidential debate , voters were telling @entity0 by nearly a 2 - 1 margin that they expected an @entity6 victory			1
many commentators were ready to hold a coronation for the president			0
now , by more than a 2 - 1 margin , voters who watched the debate are saying that @entity13 won it -- and we have a horse race on our hands			1
opinion : debate coach -- @entity6 , heat up ; @entity13 , stay cool @entity13 was one of the two big surprises of the night			1
his performance was head and shoulders above anything he has displayed so far			0
he drove the debate , had a coherent message that focused on jobs , showed a superior command of detail , was empathetic toward people hurting , and looked the president in the eye			1
president @entity6 was the other surprise			2
he was unusually flat , failed to go after @entity13 on point after point ( 47 % , @entity38 , corporations are people , etc. , etc. ) , rarely looked @entity13 in the eye , and seemed annoyed			2
my hunch is that no one has talked to him like this since his election ( except maybe @entity46 ) , and he was shocked that @entity13 denied he had ever proposed a huge cut in taxes ( which he has )			2
the net result was that @entity6 seemed to withdraw emotionally just when he should have launched a counteroffensive			2
opinion : @entity13 was n't stellar , but @entity6 fell short we wo n't know until the dust settles whether @entity13 has truly shaken up the race			1
after all , @entity55 as challenger beat president @entity57 in debates and lost the election			0
in this case , democrats are already charging foul against @entity13 for misstating facts			0
more to the point , we know from the past that incumbent presidents often come into a first debate a little complacent , lose , and then come roaring back in a second encounter ( think @entity68 1984 )			1
@entity6 is highly competitive and will surely be loaded for bear next time			0
but the first night goes down as a big upset for @entity13 -- and it is now more likely that this race will go down to the wire			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity76 .			0

@entity76 : @entity78 felt *strongly* @entity6 would win , but they *scored* @entity13 the winner
@entity13 drove the debate , with a coherent message *hammering* at jobs issue , @entity76 says
he says @entity6 missed one *opportunity* after another to go after @entity13 *effectively*
@entity76 : incumbent presidents tend to suffer in first debate , then *improve*
