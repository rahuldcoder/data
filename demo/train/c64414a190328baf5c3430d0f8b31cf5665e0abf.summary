-- experts disagreed tuesday over whether @entity2 is likely to be extradited to @entity3 , where the country 's highest criminal court overturned her acquittal and that of her former boyfriend in the 2007 killing of her roommate , @entity8			2
@entity10 and @entity11 were convicted in 2009 of murder in @entity14 's death , but a jury overturned the conviction in 2011			1
she then returned to her home city of @entity19 , @entity20 , where she is studying creative writing at the @entity22 , according to her family 's spokesman , @entity25			2
a @entity27 court or the @entity28 would be unlikely to take up any extradition request from @entity3 , said @entity30 , a former prosecutor who is now a partner at @entity31 in @entity32			1
he cited an extradition treaty between the @entity27 and @entity3 that states : " extradition shall not be granted when the person sought has been convicted , acquitted or pardoned , or has served the sentence imposed , by the @entity37 for the same acts for which extradition is requested			0
" " under @entity27 law , she was once put in jeopardy and later acquitted , " @entity30 said			1
" under the treaty , extradition should not be granted			0
" in 2011 , deputy @entity28 spokesman @entity45 told @entity0 that although the @entity27 and @entity3 have an extradition treaty , he was not able to answer speculative questions on extradition issues in the @entity10 case			1
tuesday , @entity28 acting deputy spokesman @entity50 noted that the matter was ongoing , and the @entity3 court 's full ruling had not been released			1
" we ca n't really comment beyond that , " he told reporters			0
" we never talk about extradition from this podium in terms of individual cases			1
" @entity10 may be protected on another level , too , according to @entity30			1
" her original verdict was so terribly flawed by prosecutorial overreaching , " the lawyer said , noting that the appellate court that overturned the original conviction detailed those flaws in a damning report more than 100 pages in length			1
timeline : @entity8 murder case given those errors , " i would expect @entity3 law enforcement to not seek extradition , because it would only prolong this law enforcement ordeal			0
" but @entity79 professor @entity78 said that @entity3 prosecutors might very well extradite @entity10			1
and , if retried , she " likely will be found guilty -- because the evidence supporting a conviction is pretty strong			1
" @entity10 , now 25 , has established a fan base in the @entity27 " because she has a beautiful face and an angelic appearance , " @entity78 said			1
" but remember , she originally admitted she was at the scene of the crime and she tried to blame an innocent man -- for which she was also convicted			0
" after @entity10 and @entity11 were detained for questioning in the killing , she allegedly confessed to being at her home when @entity14 was killed and implicated @entity8 , the owner of a bar where she worked			2
@entity98 was detained , but was released after two weeks when his alibi was corroborated : he had spent the night of the murder talking to a customer in his pub in @entity103 , police say			0
he went on to sue @entity10 for libel , winning 40,000 euros ( $ 54,000 ) in damages			2
@entity78 said the case was not well tried the first time			2
" but at a second trial , there 's a very high likelihood that they may very well convict her			0
" he predicted that @entity10 would resist any extradition attempt			2
but even if she were to succeed in that , " she remains a prisoner in the @entity27 , because @entity116 will put a warrant out for her and , if she travels anywhere outside the @entity27 , she 'll be immediately arrested and turned over to @entity3			0
" if @entity10 were to lose an extradition fight and then wind up being convicted , she would go to jail , he said			2
@entity2 : fascination with ' the evil female ' if he were advising @entity14 's parents , @entity78 said , he would recommend that they file a civil suit to claim the money @entity10 has received as an advance for a book about the case that is scheduled for publication next month			1
" they have a right to sue her on behalf of their dead daughter , " he said , noting that the standard required for conviction in civil cases is a preponderance of the evidence			1
" i think that would be easy to do			0
" and the extradition treaty 's reference to double jeopardy may not be binding in some cases , he said			2
" in the @entity27 , generally , when you appeal a conviction , you waive your double jeopardy rights , and we permit retrials of people who have had their convictions reversed , at least on procedural grounds , " he said			0
and what about @entity30 's prediction that @entity3 law enforcement would not seek extradition ? " i think he 's wrong , " @entity78 said			1
" i think the @entity3 legal system will welcome a second trial			0
they 'll put new prosecutors on the case , good ones , and seek to vindicate themselves			0
" " they will want to have a second opportunity to show that @entity3 justice can be pure			0
" @entity78 said purity has also eluded many members of the @entity27 news media who have covered the case closely			2
" one issue is why the @entity27 media portrayed her in such positive terms , " he said			0
" at best , she was a terrible person who tried to blame it on some innocent person and she was clearly a liar , and at worst she participated in a horrible murder , and the @entity27 media focused much more on @entity2 than on the victim of the case because @entity2 was prettier and an @entity27 and an @entity27 sweetheart			0
" had she been ugly , he argued , the case would have attracted little attention			0
@entity10 's lawyer , @entity186 , told @entity0 that his client was not guilty			1
" these charges still remain just as unfounded , just as unjust , as they were before , " he said			1
2011 : how the four - year court saga unfolded			0

" @entity191 should not be granted , " former prosecutor @entity30 says
" the evidence supporting a conviction is pretty strong , " @entity78 says
the @entity28 will not *discuss* individual cases
" these charges still remain just as unfounded , " @entity10 's lawyer says
