-- after months of fanfare and anticipation , gigabit home internet service @entity1 finally went live on tuesday in @entity5			1
the search giant is offering 1 gbps speeds for just $ 70 per month -- significantly faster and cheaper than what any traditional @entity9 isps are offering			1
" we just got it today and i 've been stuck in front of my laptop for the last few hours , " @entity11 , founder of @entity12 , told @entity0			0
i 'm probably not going to leave the house			1
" he lives in a four - bedroom house run by " @entity19 " on @entity5 's @entity21 neighborhood , just on the state border with @entity23			1
the house has become one of the hubs for the @entity27 , an informal group of entrepreneurs who have clustered around homes immediately eligible for @entity1			1
five cool things about @entity1 meanwhile , @entity11 said that on an @entity33 connection , he 's seen consistent @entity1 speeds of 600 to 700 mbps , with @entity35 topping out around 200 mbps			1
even at the slower wireless speeds , that 's more than an order of magnitude faster than what most @entity9 have at home			1
" the first thing i did was @entity43 , " he said			0
" i think that took two minutes , let me try it again right now			0
" prior to tuesday , @entity11 — one of the house 's first two residents — said he 'd been working out of local @entity49 and @entity50 locations for their free @entity35			1
@entity52 es tu @entity35 the @entity19 , founded by local web developer @entity54 , had originally been conceived as a matchmaking scheme between entrepreneurs who wanted a free place to live and work , and local families who would open their homes to them			2
( @entity0 covered that effort back in august			0
) but once @entity1 announced its fiber rollout schedule , @entity54 realized the families that had signed up were not going to get crazy speeds until @entity66			1
so he took matters into his own hands and , with his wife 's blessing , he liquidated his @entity71 to put 20 percent down on a house they eventually bought for $ 48,000 in september 2012			1
the couple has no plans to profit from the house			2
instead , they want to use it as a way to nurture @entity5 's nascent tech community			1
he 's letting entrepreneurs like @entity11 live in the house rent - free and utilities - free for three months — they just have to pay for their own groceries			1
" we 're strong , devout @entity87 , " @entity54 told @entity0			0
" i 've been pushing on doors and a lot of doors have opened for me			0
i feel like this is what i 'm supposed to do right now			2
it does n't make a lot of financial sense but i really think it will benefit @entity5			2
the whole reason why [ we bought the house ] was that no one in @entity5 was really exploiting fiber like we could be and this is the way i can bring in individuals that will exploit it			1
it helps that it 's not a really expensive house			2
[ my wife ] is a stay - at - home mom with two kids too , so we 're living off my one salary , and it 's still a strain			2
it 's a still a big strain			0
" he anticipates getting donations , sponsorships , or , the most - likely scenario , renting out one of the bedrooms via @entity119 to the first @entity1 " tourists " — people who might want to come for a day or two at a time to try it out			1
" $ 50 a night for 10 nights a month would cover mortgage and most of the utilities , " he said			0
@entity54 has been so busy dealing with local media requests that he has n't yet had a chance to use the connection himself — he and his family live about 20 minutes away from the second house , and their neighborhood was not included in the first rollout regions			2
@entity5 , setting itself apart @entity11 said he knew he 's been spoiled : " wherever i go after this , my internet speed is going to be ruined			1
" his company , @entity12 , hopes to provide an added benefit to the growing 3d printing ecosystem			0
" we 're building a front - end dev toolkit that lets developers view and manipulate 3d models in a browser , " he said			0
" we have an api that lets you communicate those models directly to 3d printers entirely in javascript without need to convert to a 3d model			0
we want to shake up manufacturing with tools that will allow people to buy products made for them			0
" @entity11 moved to @entity5 from @entity156 to work on his new startup — and while the move was driven in part by @entity1 , being able to live rent - free for 90 days was huge			1
he had considered staying home in @entity156 or moving to @entity161 , but both cities are notoriously expensive			0
" i do n't want to raise capital yet and it 's hard to do that if i would need to get a part - time job just to pay rent , " he added			2
" all of that stuff is taken care for me , that was the big thing			0
people are too quick to discredit the value of a free - rent environment with like - minded people			0
@entity5 needs to separate itself from the other scenes			2
" why here ? fiber is not enough			0
i think you need to have a dense startup community , and if young people are not moving here and trying to start startups , you need to artificially create that flow			0

@entity1 , the company 's *ultra-high* speed internet service , went live on tuesday in @entity5
user : " it 's unbelievable . i 'm probably not going to leave the house "
the service is significantly faster than what traditional @entity9 isps are offering
@entity195 may rent out room to @entity1 " tourists " who might want to come to try it out
