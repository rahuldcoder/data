-- a report released this week tells us that the international war on drugs is failing			1
that comes as no surprise as a growing number of policy experts , pundits and politicians have reached that conclusion , including former secretary of state @entity12 , former @entity14 president @entity13 , and former @entity16 president @entity15			1
among other findings , the report documents that inflation - adjusted and purity - adjusted prices of marijuana , cocaine and heroin have all decreased dramatically since 1990 in as geographically diverse areas as @entity25 , the @entity26 and @entity27			1
in other words , illegal drugs are plentiful and cheap around the world			2
so now what ? the report 's policy recommendations are relatively tepid			1
it emphasizes the need to shift from a strategy of eradication and interdiction of drugs to one focused more on drug abuse prevention and treatment			1
although that shift away from law enforcement to a " harm reduction " approach would be an improvement on the current futile , counterproductive strategy , it is not nearly sufficient			0
moreover , the report too readily accepts the conventional wisdom that drug use is largely responsible for a host of social pathologies			1
the reality is that the strategy of drug prohibition , not drug use itself , is responsible for many of those pathologies			1
drug abuse is certainly a major public health problem , and its societal costs are considerable			1
but banning the drug trade creates ugly social and economic distortions			2
because certain drugs are illegal , there is an enormous black - market premium ( by most estimates , up to 90 % of the retail price ) associated with them			2
moreover , people who are willing to traffic in an illegal product often do not have many qualms about violating other laws			0
@entity77 enables the most unsavory , violence - prone individuals and organizations to dominate the commerce			2
drug prohibition leads inevitably to corruption and violence -- to a disturbing extent in the @entity26 and even more so in drug - source or drug - transiting countries			1
the problems caused by the war on drugs are even more damaging to societies than those caused by drug use per se			1
opinion : legalized pot would mean more addiction in @entity14 , for example , about 60,000 people have perished in armed conflicts among the various drug cartels and between the cartels and the @entity14 authorities over the past 6Â½ years			0
another 20,000 people have gone missing			0
that turmoil has found even more fertile soil in the smaller , weaker countries of @entity106			0
today , @entity14 - based drug cartels control major swaths of territory in both @entity110 and @entity111 , and they pose a growing threat to the authority of governments throughout the region			0
as the report notes , the international drug trade is a $ 350 billion - a - year industry			2
there is no realistic way to suppress such an economic juggernaut			0
we can only determine whether the trade will be in the hands of honest businesses or ruthless criminals			0
the quixotic @entity26 crusade against alcohol in the 1920s and early 1930s demonstrated that a prohibition strategy empowers and enriches odious criminals			2
when alcohol was outlawed , the commerce fell into the hands of gangsters like @entity136 and @entity137			0
bootleggers bribed and corrupted elected officials and police personnel throughout the country			0
there were shootouts on the streets of @entity145 , @entity146 and other @entity26 citiesâ € ” just as we have gunbattles between drug gangs in large cities today			0
once @entity77 ended , legitimate business provided consumers with the beverages they sought , and the carnage and corruption subsided			0
today , suppliers such as @entity158 , @entity159 , and @entity160 dominate the trade			0
ending drug prohibition is not a panacea			1
under a legalized system for alcoholic beverages , we still have to deal with drunk driving , alcoholism and other social problems			0
yet no rational person would advocate returning to @entity77 with all its ugly consequences			0
the folly of alcohol prohibition was confined to the @entity26			1
thanks largely to @entity176 's pressure -- drug prohibition is a global folly			1
we should learn from history and do more than make modest shifts in anti-drug strategies			1
we need to bite the bullet , accepting the reality that our second fling with prohibition has n't worked any better than the first			0
@entity187 should begin with the comprehensive legalization of marijuana , not just incremental , partial legalization as voters in @entity192 and @entity176 approved last year			1
we also need to begin a serious discussion about how to deal with harder drugs within a framework of legalization			1
whatever the specifics of a new policy , there needs to be recognition both in the @entity26 and around the world that prohibition is an unsustainable approach			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity208 : it 's no surprise that a new report says the global war on drugs is failing
@entity206 : drug prohibition leads to corruption , violence and a host of societal problems
he says the folly of alcohol prohibition offers us lessons in anti-drug strategies
@entity206 : change of policy should begin with legalization of marijuana
