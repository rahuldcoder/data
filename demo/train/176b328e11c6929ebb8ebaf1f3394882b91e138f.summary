-- a national breast cancer charity is being accused of using misleading statistics to convince women to have mammograms , according to a paper published thursday in the @entity6			1
@entity7 for the @entity9 's mammography campaign during breast cancer awareness month last october has come under fire from professors @entity12 and @entity14 at the @entity15 , who say the foundation overstated the benefits of the procedure and totally ignored the risks			1
" the ad implies that mammograms have a huge effect , but the only evidence that they use is the five - year survival rate for breast cancer when caught early is 98 % and when it 's not , 23 % , " @entity12 said			1
" the problem is that in the context of screening survival , statistics are meaningless			1
" " to make an informed decision , you not only have to know the benefits you have to know the harm			0
and the ad does not say anything about harm , it just gives you this exaggerated benefit statistic , " @entity12 said			0
" screening is a genuine decision people need to make and they can only make it if they have the facts			0
it does n't mean that screening is not good , it means it does good and it does harm			0
some people can benefit and some will get hurt , and the harm is just as real as the benefit			0
" a teaching moment about politics and @entity7 @entity12 and @entity14 write a series that highlights exaggerations , distortions and selective reporting in advertising , news stories and medical journals that are misleading			1
they say the problem in @entity7 's case is using survival statistics to determine the benefit of screening			1
" there is no correlation between changes in survival and changes in how many people die			0
" twenty to 50 % of women who get screened every year end up having at least one false alarm over 10 years , and 5 - 20 % actually end up having to have a biopsy to rule out cancer			0
" the most important harm is overdiagnosis -- screening can find cancers that were never destined to cause harm because it grows so slowly or can go away on its own , " he said			0
" it would never have harmed you , you would never have known about it and you would have lived your whole life and died from something else			0
they get radiation , chemotherapy , surgery and it 's all unnecessary			1
" @entity12 also says the @entity7 ad ignores the problems with screening			1
he says for every life saved by screening two to 10 women are ' overdiagnosed ' , suffer anxiety and undergo unnecessary radiation , chemotherapy or surgery			0
he said in the end , it all boils down to this : " you ca n't make a good decision unless you have the basic facts			0
it exaggerated the benefit and it ignored the harm			0
" experimental drug offers new way to battle certain breast cancer but @entity7 , the world 's largest breast cancer charity , says while mammography is n't perfect , it 's still the best detection tool available			1
" we have long advocated for women to be informed about the benefits and risks of early detection and treatment , " said @entity115 , @entity7 's vice president of research , evaluation and scientific programs			1
" the numbers are not in question			0
early detection allows for early treatment , which gives women the best chance of surviving breast cancer			1
" since its inception in 1982 , the organization -- creator of the " pink ribbon , " a symbol of breast cancer awareness and the official symbol of @entity137 -- has invested nearly $ 2 billion in research			0
" we 've said for years that science has to do better , which is why @entity7 is putting millions of dollars into research to detect breast cancer before symptoms start -- through biomarkers , for example , " said @entity115			1
" @entity7 also is funding research to help accurately predict which tumors will spread and which wo n't			1
while we invest in getting those answers , we think it 's simply irresponsible to effectively discourage women from taking steps to know what 's going on with their health			1
" @entity115 said @entity7 encourages women to work with their health care providers to find out what 's right for them			1
but according to @entity12 , a recent survey he and his colleagues conducted showed even doctors mistake improved survival as proof that screening saves lives			0
" the survival statistics are confusing for doctors , too , " he said			2
" this is a real communication problem that doctors and patients alike face , so whenever you hear about survival statistics in the context of screening , you should ignore them			2
" the only way to know if a screening test works is if it is proven in a randomized trial that shows that less people die because of screening			0
" ' overdiagnosis ' of breast cancer may be higher than thought dr. @entity180 , chief of surgical oncology at @entity182 in @entity183 , said none of this is new			0
" it is not uncommon in the medical field for researchers , doctors and health care professionals to use statistics in a way that advances their point of view			2
results can be spun to be either favorable or unfavorable , depending on one 's stance , " @entity180 said			2
" the @entity7 foundation is doing nothing new by presenting data that supports their position in a favorable light			1
although there is controversy regarding the absolute benefit of mammography screening in many studies , most breast surgeons stand behind the @entity7 foundation 's stance that screening mammography saves lives , " @entity180 said			1
" we all agree that screening increases the number of procedures that are performed , but finding a tumor at an earlier stage can not be worse than finding it when it is larger			0
" " lead - time " bias can also contribute to misrepresentation of mammography 's advantages , according to the @entity226 ( @entity226 ) , a group of patient and professional organizations			1
this means , for example , if deadly cancer is found early through screening , it may seem like the patient lived longer because of " lead - time			2
" but the coalition says this makes screening appear more beneficial than it is , because testing is actually detecting tumors that have a better prognosis			0
" @entity226 believes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against universal screening mammography in any age group of women , " according to the organization 's website			1
" women who have symptoms of breast cancer such as a lump , pain or nipple discharge should seek a diagnostic mammogram			0
the decision to undergo screening for asymptomatic women must be made on an individual level based on a woman 's personal preferences , family history and risk factors			2
" mammography does not prevent or cure breast cancer , and has many limitations , " the website says			2
" women are told that mammography screening saves lives , but the evidence of a mortality ( death rate ) reduction from screening is conflicting and continues to be questioned by some scientists , policy makers and members of the public			2
" dr. @entity274 , chief medical officer of the @entity275 , said he understands @entity12 and @entity14 's message			2
" it is very , very difficult to convey information about screening , especially mammography , and convey it accurately , " @entity274 told @entity0			2
" in the @entity275 's screening recommendations , the first paragraph recommends women over the age of 40 get a mammogram annually			2
the second paragraph says that women should be told the limitations of screening			0
... some of the folks at @entity7 are trying to do the right thing , and i just respect how difficult that is			1

a paper accuses the @entity7 foundation of using misleading statistics
it *criticizes* @entity7 's mammography campaign last october
@entity7 *maintains* early detection leads to early treatment
*spinning* statistics is nothing new , an oncologist says
