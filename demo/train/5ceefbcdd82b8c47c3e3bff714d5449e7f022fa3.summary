-- every biologist , botanist , and zoologist will tell you the same thing : nature loves variety			2
people may fear it , and some religious or political groups may hate it -- but @entity6 loves it			2
the desert grassland whiptail ( @entity12 ) forms female pairs			0
and these female couples reproduce ... successfully			0
the anglerfish female is spiny , ugly , and so much bigger than the male that most humans do n't even see him : the tiny little glob attached to the lady anglerfish by his teeth			1
she feeds him and after a while , he loses his eyeballs and she takes his sperm			0
and do n't get me started on the saddleback tamarins , monkeys whose families are composed of mother , father , offspring , and an " extra father " serving as mother 's lover and nursemaid for the baby tamarin			1
( it 's called cooperative polyandry , and if you 're rushing to get to work while trying to feed the baby applesauce and keep it off your sweater , the life of a tamarin does n't sound too bad			1
) it may be that people are finally getting the idea			0
after years of pretending that @entity53 and @entity54 's " nuclear family " ( what an expression ! ) was the norm , we seem to have noticed that it was only ever really widespread among the upper middle class or in parts of the country so isolated and wild that not even mothers - in - law came to call			1
that vision had its brief and waxily shining moment , for a small portion of the population , for a very little while ( by 1980 , more women worked outside the home than did n't )			0
for the rest of us , we realize more every day that each branch and twig of love that can be put to use to support our families , whether sprawling and far - flung or tiny and barely afloat , is necessary			1
@entity0 : the 4 most annoying things i love about my family ... love is not love which alters when it alteration finds , or bends with the remover to remove : o no ! it is an ever - fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken ... i used to think that @entity89 's @entity88 was about romantic love			1
i used to think that romantic love was the only kind that caused fireworks of the heart and deserved serious attention			1
i nursed people who were dying			0
i stood under the chuppah with my stepson 's mother , at his wedding			0
always elegant , always mischievous , she leaned toward me and whispered , " oooh , they 're all thinking , look how those two get along			0
" and even if people did n't think that ( i 'm pretty sure they were admiring the handsome groom and beautiful bride and not the two nutty ladies chuckling in the corner ) , it was gratifying that in addition to this payoff for decency , there was even the glint of genuine affection			0
and my ex-husband 's father threw an arm over my husband 's shoulder as they strolled beneath the twinkling lights , discussing hockey 's greatest moments			0
@entity0 : 9 great ways to connect with your world it turns out that , if you believe in love , there are an awful lot of people to love			1
i do n't mean just that you have the opportunity to love them , i mean that you 'd better love them , even if your history with them is not so happy , even if they piss you off , even if they 're practically strangers			1
my love for my children means that i have to love their father , too			1
i do n't have to wish we were still married to each other , i do n't have to be his wingman when he 's single or his best man when he 's marrying , but i do have to find a way to love him , because he is a good man , and a loving father , and he is still part of my family ... and now so is his partner			1
my mother 's love for me meant that even as she was mourning the end of my long relationship with someone she loved , at a time in her life when she was frail and tired and wanted nothing more than routine and comfort , she welcomed my future husband as if she 'd been waiting for him and she welcomed his mother , too , happy for there to be more			1
@entity0 : what happily ever after really looks like as the world gets bigger , families need to expand			1
two mommies not only rely on the usual cadre of pals and relatives that all lucky people do , they are wise to attach a couple of necessary and loving male figures			0
the two dads often do the same , and every single parent i know has managed , through love and bribery and persistence , to create a network ( and a safety net ) for their small basic unit			2
this seems like a good thing , for all of us			0
for those of us in the more conventional units , these others who go out and forage for family are excellent role models , and sooner or later we would be wise to imitate them			2
instead of lonely widows in condos , would n't a lot of us be happier four to a house , taking our chances on @entity200 's coq au vin and thursday night poker ? might n't the single mothers and four children be better off sharing a place , chipping in from two salaries for an au pair ? it sounds practical , which it is , but it is also about love			2
our capacity to love is not limited ; time is a constraint and so is energy , but love that makes your life better gives you more of what you need			2
old - fashioned ( whatever that is ) , or brand - new ( to us ) , there is no kind of love and no kind of family we should ever turn our back on			1
friends creating a household , people joining forces to care for elderly parents , single parents creating a little village , single men and women finding some passionate attachment to others , whether romantic or platonic : let 's throw open the doors in our lives to a variety of families , and gather up the whole beautiful , variegated bouquet of them			2
