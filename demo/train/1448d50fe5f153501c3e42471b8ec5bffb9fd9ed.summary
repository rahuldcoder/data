-- @entity1 just turned @entity2 2015 into a sure thing for millions of men			0
the studio is moving its release date for the movie adaptation of the erotic romance @entity9 out of next summer and onto @entity2 weekend 2015 , turning what was sure to be a @entity13 event into an epic @entity14			1
the news , reported exclusively in this week 's @entity0 cover story , comes on the heels of the studio 's announcement that it has pushed the start of production in @entity23 back a month to allow for the production to prep with its new leading man , @entity26 actor @entity25 , who plays kinky billionaire @entity9			1
but , @entity1 says , the casting change is not the primary reason for the new release date			1
@entity0 : @entity31 launches ' @entity9 ' wine more pressing is the crowded summer schedule @entity9 was originally competing in			1
originally set to hit screens august 1 , 2014 , the film , based on the sexy best - seller by @entity31 , was set to go up opposite @entity37 's potential new franchise @entity36 starring @entity38 and @entity39			1
internationally things are even busier , with many studios pushing their big tentpoles out of next june and july — to avoid competition from the @entity44 in @entity45 — and into august			0
" we see this movie as a global event , " @entity1 chairman @entity46 tells @entity0			0
" the strength of this book is really worldwide , so we want to be able to take advantage of women who are invariably on vacation with their families during the month of august in @entity56			0
" now the film will debut on @entity2 weekend , beginning on friday , february 13 , which also coincides with the @entity60 holiday , giving @entity1 the opportunity to post a big three - day number for that frame			0
@entity64 , who was instrumental in bringing the @entity9 franchise to the studio , adds that @entity1 would likely have made the change even if @entity68 , the original actor cast as @entity9 , had not dropped out in mid-october			2
" together with the international marketing and distribution team , we 've been looking really closely at the august date and becoming more and more convinced that the right thing to do for the movie was to push it , " @entity64 says			2
" so even if @entity68 had stayed , we still would have been making the date change			0
" @entity0 : see the full ' @entity9 ' coverage the film 's new date will put it up against the adaptation of @entity81 ' @entity80 , which has yet to begin production or hire a cast			1
who knows , maybe the fear of competing with @entity9 will keep it away			2
