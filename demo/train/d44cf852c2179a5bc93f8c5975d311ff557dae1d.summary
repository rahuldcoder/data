-- two young news anchors for @entity4 's @entity3 television network -- both @entity1 -- have blasted @entity6 's military intervention in @entity7 , and their editor - in - chief claims the announcements , and the " mainstream media 's " reaction to them , are part of a media war			1
" we 've got a genuine war going on , " @entity14 , @entity3 's editor - in - chief , wrote on @entity3 's website			1
" no , thank @entity17 , it 's not in @entity19			1
it 's a media war			1
" sitting behind the @entity3 anchor desk on wednesday , @entity22 - based @entity21 told the audience she " could not be part of a network funded by the @entity4 government that whitewashes the actions of ( president @entity30 ) @entity29 , " adding " i 'm proud to be an @entity1 and believe in disseminating the truth , and that is why after this newscast i am resigning			1
" the day before , @entity34 announced on air , " i ca n't say enough how strongly i am against any state intervention in a sovereign nation 's affairs ... what @entity4 did is wrong			1
" @entity40 , however , did not resign and criticized " mainstream media " for ignoring her previous criticism of @entity1 military action in other countries			1
@entity3 called @entity21 's action a " self - promotional stunt " and , commenting on @entity40 's move , said @entity3 staff members are free to express their views			1
the public criticism of @entity29 's actions on @entity7 is an embarrassment for @entity3 , but @entity14 is rallying her journalists for a war , which , she believes , is directed by the @entity1 government with its foot soldiers being the @entity1 media			1
" the storm of articles posted about rt over the last couple of days -- literally tons of printed copy -- looks as if it were written to dictation , " she wrote			0
" hardly any respectable media outlet refrained from lambasting and lynching @entity3 journalists in articles or reports			1
" @entity14 works for @entity3 , she said , because , " it 's my country			2
there is no other choice for me			0
" depicting itself as an " alternative " voice is part of @entity3 's marketing strategy			2
organized in 2005 as an international tv news channel funded by the @entity4 government , its original name was " @entity3 " and its early mission was to inform the world about events and life in @entity4			1
that strategy , an rt editor told me bluntly a year ago , " was a mistake , really , " because few people around the world are that interested in @entity4			2
the network soon lost its @entity4 image , re-branding itself as " rt , " its @entity91 - language broadcasts featuring young @entity1 , and concentrating largely on @entity1 news			2
@entity3 now has 2,500 employees , including editorial , technical and support staff , and five stations : @entity97 , @entity98 ( @entity91 language ) , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			2
this spring rt is launching its own video agency in @entity105 to compete with @entity106 and @entity107			0
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity109 on wednesday , @entity21 said that , in its reports on the @entity7 crisis , " rt is not about the truth			2
it 's about promoting a @entity114 agenda , and i can tell you firsthand , it 's also about bashing @entity98			0
" the editorial policy is set by its senior @entity4 editors			0
" middle - management , " she said , " is @entity1 , and their role is to make sure we 're in line			0
" a senior staff member at @entity3 insists the staff decides @entity3 's editorial policy , not the @entity4 government , and compares rt with the @entity128 , @entity129 24 , @entity130 , and other state - funded news outlets			1
@entity4 , that staff member says , must constantly fight the @entity135 image of the " @entity136 , " and that could take years to overcome			0
@entity137 , an expert from the @entity138 who served in the @entity141 and @entity4 military for more than 20 years , says @entity3 's approach differs significantly from news broadcasting in the @entity141			1
" the @entity141 system of propaganda talked about @entity4			0
they had @entity4 announcers , by and large , and they tried to project @entity141 ideas , @entity141 ideology , @entity141 experience			0
" " this time there 's nothing to project , they do n't care about it			0
what they do care about is introducing themselves in the @entity158 and challenging the established truths and half - truths of the @entity158 media , of the @entity162			0
it 's not about @entity4			2
" meanwhile , in an ironic bit of timing , the " @entity3 " name is back again			0
in a bombshell announcement in late december , president @entity29 issued a decree creating an international broadcasting entity to carry @entity4 's views to the world , to be called " @entity3			1
" he also liquidated two @entity141 - era media outlets , @entity174 news agency and @entity3 international radio			2
details of the new agency 's structure and mission are expected any day			0
for the past 20 years , since the collapse of the @entity141 , @entity4 has been struggling to project its ideas to the world			0
the @entity183 and its opening ceremony were a major step in @entity29 's revamping of @entity4 's image			1
now , with the new " @entity3 , " he will have both the message -- and the medium -- to present it			0
his actions in @entity7 , however , are likely , at a minimum , to overshadow the birth of that new agency and , more likely , tarnish it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

one @entity3 anchor quits and another criticizes @entity6 's intervention in @entity7
@entity195 notes that @entity3 editor said " mainstream media " in war with @entity3
@entity3 is an *arm* of @entity4 's media *apparatus* , and is *due* for another *rebranding* , she says
she says the intervention in @entity19 will overshadow and may tarnish @entity3
