@entity0 -- a new report saying that @entity3 could be secretly working on a nuclear weapon is a major development , but not one that should lead the @entity7 to consider a military strike against the @entity10 regime , according to analyst @entity11			1
the draft report , obtained by @entity1 and not yet approved by the @entity14 's board of governors , is the @entity17 nuclear watchdog agency 's strongest warning yet that @entity3 could be aiming to build a nuclear bomb			1
@entity11 told @entity1 the report should spur @entity7 diplomacy to prevent @entity3 from developing nuclear weapons but that talk by commentators outside the @entity7 government of a potential military strike against @entity3 was wrongheaded			1
" to be casually talking about military action because we 're getting frustrated seems to me somewhat dangerous , " he said			2
@entity3 's @entity27 of protesters against the regime indicates that waiting could have its benefits , @entity11 said			1
" at the end of the day , time is not on the side of this regime			1
it 's a dysfunctional regime that has run the economy into the ground , taken a great and open and proud nation and turned it into a kind of paranoid and closed one and which is clearly losing the support of young @entity3 by the day			1
" @entity11 , author and host of @entity1 's " @entity44 , " spoke to @entity1 on thursday			2
@entity1 : the @entity14 has done a report saying that @entity3 could be at work on building a nuclear weapon			1
what do you think that means ? @entity11 : that 's a major development because so far we have not really been able to assess whether @entity3 has decided definitively that it wants nuclear weapons			1
we know that it wants a nuclear capacity -- that is clear -- and it wants a large nuclear capacity and one that is robust so that they have multiple production sites			0
but it has always seemed as though there were two views within the @entity3 leadership			2
one was that @entity3 should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the @entity69			2
there are clearly others in @entity3 who believe that @entity3 should simply have nuclear weapons			2
... this would suggest that the harder line faction within @entity3 is winning out			2
we do n't know for sure because this is all guesswork frankly			0
... @entity1 : what 's happening with the negotiations ? @entity11 : the @entity3 have been playing a very peculiar negotiating game where they sometimes seem interested in negotiating but rarely do they actually engage in good faith			1
... they rarely seem to engage in these with a consistent pattern with consistent positions -- which either means the leadership is very divided or they 're playing games			0
@entity1 : what 's your view about the wisdom of imposing new sanctions ? @entity11 : it probably is the only course available right now since the prospect of engaging with @entity3 and giving it positive inducements does not seem to be going anywhere			1
i also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the @entity98 within the regime , which seems to be most powerful faction			2
and that 's the right approach to take			0
we know that generalized sanctions only hurt the average @entity3 , and that is entirely counterproductive			2
@entity1 : what 's the impact of the domestic turbulence inside @entity3 , including the protest movement ? @entity11 : nobody knows for sure , but it does seem to have confused the situation internally			1
[ @entity3 president @entity113 ] @entity112 had made some conciliatory statements on the nuclear issue , which were then attacked by the opposition , and he retracted it , which suggests that he 's feeling the pressure			1
it suggests that there are divisions within the regime , there 's some sense of vulnerability			2
... it just makes it more difficult to negotiate with them , but it also suggests it may not be the worst thing in the world to wait and watch how this plays out in @entity3			0
@entity1 : what do you think about the military option ? @entity11 : the problems with the military option remain what they 've always been , and it 's a little alarming to see the way in which people are gravitating toward a military option , out of a sort of frustration that there is n't some magical solution here			1
the military option is certainly not a magical solution			0
it 's a very risky strategy with many potentially large , unintended consequences			0
a military strike would be a pre-emptive invasion of another country by the @entity7			1
it would not have any sanction in international law			0
it would not be supported by the vast majority of the world , and it would only delay rather than destroy the @entity3 program			0
i 've talked to many military experts , and we do not seem to have the ability to completely destroy a program like this , partly because nuclear technology is after all not some cutting - edge technology			0
this is 60 - year old technology , and there are lots of people in @entity3 who are trained scientists			0
it would also strengthen the hard - line elements within the regime , would weaken the @entity27 because they would have to come out in support of the regime , and against what would be a foreign attack on @entity3 soil			1
it would inflame the @entity183 and make tensions rise everywhere , including the two places where the @entity7 has a huge stake and tens of thousands of troops -- @entity188 and @entity189 -- and it would put the moderate @entity191 on the defense			0
it would have the effect of radicalizing the region			0
and those are pretty much the known consequences			0
... then , there 's always in the business of war , the unknown consequences			0
what would @entity3 's reaction be ? ... what kind of militia operations could it fund in @entity189 and @entity188 that would directly kill @entity7 ? @entity1 : do you think the administration is seriously contemplating military action ? @entity11 : i do n't think the administration is seriously contemplating it , but i 'm struck by the degree to which many outside commentators are doing it , and the danger is ... that the administration places itself in a box where it says things which leave it no option but to keep taking a harder and harder line			1
i do n't think it 's likely , but i do worry that there is a train which is leaving the station , which might end up in a military strike			1
@entity1 : do you think secretary of state @entity228 has been sounding the right note ? @entity11 : absolutely			0
secretary @entity228 has been sounding the right note and being tough , making the point that they 're willing to engage with the @entity3 if they are serious			0
i also think this most recent declaration by @entity14 will make it easier for us to continue building a containment strategy against @entity3 , getting moderate @entity191 countries to ally with the @entity7 , tacitly with @entity237 and against @entity3 politically and militarily within the region , get the @entity239 even more strongly on board and most crucially get the @entity241 and the @entity242 on board for sanctions in the @entity17 -- further , tighter and tougher sanctions			1
@entity1 : aside from sanctions and watchful waiting , is there anything else that should be done ? @entity11 : i think we should be supporting the @entity27 in @entity3			1
i do n't think we need to do it in a dramatic and overt kind of way , which would probably be counterproductive			0
but there are ways in word and deed that the @entity7 could make clear that we support the aspirations of those @entity3 who want a more normal @entity3 , a more open democratic @entity3 , more engaged with the world			0
that is not inconsistent with us saying we want to negotiate with @entity3			0
we did that with the @entity263			0
if there was a way for us to construct a containment strategy that at the same time left room for negotiations on the one hand and also left room for us to express our hopes and support for a different @entity3 in the future , that would be the best long - term strategy for us			2
... it 's difficult to predict when and where things will change , but it 's difficult to imagine that 25 years from now @entity3 will still be run by this unholy alliance of a bunch of reactionary mullahs and power - hungry military leaders .			1
