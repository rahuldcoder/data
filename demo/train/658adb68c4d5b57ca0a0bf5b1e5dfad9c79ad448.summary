@entity0 -- the red carpet is fashion 's grandest stage where stars line up to see and be seen			1
but who you are wearing is as important as who you are			0
if @entity11 , wife of @entity13 - winning actor @entity12 , gets her way , the kind of fabric you are wearing will be just as essential			1
now in its third year , the @entity15 was established to persuade top designers to dress the world 's most famous faces in clothing that is ecologically friendly and socially responsible			1
" first of all , you want to wear something that is made with non-toxic materials and dyes and also that it 's made by people who are happy fundamentally , " @entity11 says			1
she has worn yarn made from recycled plastic bottles to the @entity26 , material from repurposed thrift store finds for the @entity13 and discarded fabric to meet @entity30 now she is persuading some of the biggest names in film and fashion to follow suit including designer and film director @entity36 , @entity38 legend @entity37 and rising star @entity39			1
" a designer will create a gown for an actress anyway			0
so what we do is to work with the designers to switch the fabric to eco-alternatives , " @entity11 said			2
one of @entity11 's own " green carpet " triumphs was an emerald green gown made of upcycled fabric created from scratch by @entity54 designer @entity53 who produces her designs out of a small workshop / showroom in @entity0			1
" we source from mills in @entity59 and @entity60			0
we upcycle fabrics and we produce everything locally			0
it 's zero clothes miles , " @entity53 said			2
sourcing fabrics this way allows @entity53 to oversee every step of the production process which she says leads to a superior product but not perhaps superior profits			0
" people buy for design rather than sustainability			0
when they find out about it , i 'm hoping that they will buy more ! " but fashion journalist @entity76 would like to see people buying less			2
she started the @entity15 with @entity11 in 2009 in the hope it would encourage people to try new things with uncommon materials and clothes already in existence			1
" innovation , as it 's told by mainstream fashion , is about wearing the latest look from the latest celebrity or whatever , " @entity76 said			2
" ironically , we are working with celebrities , but we 're showing that it 's not just about imitating a trend			0
it 's actually about techniques , about tailoring and heritage fabrics			0
it 's about the narrative of a piece , " she added			0
it 's a trend that @entity11 hopes will continue			2
" next year we hope to have a dedicated lane at the @entity13 for the @entity15 people , " @entity11 said .			1
