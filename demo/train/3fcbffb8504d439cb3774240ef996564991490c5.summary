the @entity1 government raised its terror threat level friday from " substantial " to " severe , " the fourth highest of five levels , in response to events in @entity6 and @entity7 , where @entity9 militants have seized a large swath of territory			1
" that means that a terrorist attack is highly likely , but there is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is imminent , " home secretary @entity12 said			0
the " root cause " of @entity1 's terror threat is " @entity22 extremism , " prime minister @entity18 said			1
the execution of @entity25 journalist @entity24 is clear evidence that @entity9 's fight in @entity6 and @entity7 " is not some foreign conflict thousands of miles from home that we can hope to ignore , " according to the @entity1 leader			1
@entity9 is unlike other @entity22 extremist groups in its primary focus not to find a country that can be its base of operations , but to create its own country			2
and the group has had ample success in that regard , given the vast reach already of what it calls the @entity45			0
while it 's been widely reviled internationally , @entity9 has managed to attract some support among @entity47 and drawn foreign fighters , like the masked man with an apparent @entity1 accent who took part in @entity24 's beheading , who some fear could soon carry out attacks back home			1
even without specific threats in the @entity57 , @entity9 ' track record in @entity7 and @entity6 -- where it was known to massacre minorities , forcefully institute @entity61 law and stage executions and stonings -- suggest it may be capable of anything			1
@entity18 said the group poses a " greater and deeper " threat than @entity1 has ever known			1
" this is @entity70 version 6.0 , " @entity67 , a former @entity25 ambassador to @entity6 and @entity7 , told @entity68 on friday			1
" they are like nothing we have ever seen before			0
" travel restrictions , an increase in police activity @entity9 has been operating for years ; now its actions in @entity6 are prompting the @entity25 to target its fighters with airstrikes there and to threaten more such strikes in @entity7			1
@entity18 said military force is among the tools that can be used against @entity9 , while adding that aid , diplomacy and political influence should also be part of @entity1 's response			1
that said , his focus friday was n't so much about what to do about @entity9 overseas as it was keeping @entity1 citizens back home safe			1
the prime minister vowed he will soon announce plans to stop would - be jihadists from traveling to @entity7 and @entity6 and to make it easier to take their passports away			1
@entity1 also needs to do more to stop current fighters from returning from the @entity100 and to deal decisively with those who already have returned , he said			2
@entity1 authorities estimate that 500 @entity1 have gone to @entity7 and @entity6 to fight with @entity22 groups			1
@entity1 's national policing lead for counterterrorism , @entity105 , said -- while the threat level just went up friday -- police have been escalating their efforts to combat the jihadist threat for months			1
he claimed 69 arrests in the first half of 2014 for offenses ranging from funding " terrorist activity through to the preparation and / or instigation of terrorism acts and traveling abroad for terrorist training			0
" @entity68 national security analyst @entity118 says @entity1 likely hiked its terror threat level because " there 's no way you can track 500 people			1
" at the same time , he downplayed the idea that friday 's announcement means an attack is imminent			0
" this is what governments are paid to do : they are paid to worry about their citizens , " @entity118 said , noting that the @entity1 threat level has gone up before without a subsequent attack			1
" that does n't mean their citizens should be in a constant state of worry			0
" holiday security amped in @entity25 -- but not due to @entity9 security will increase this long @entity141 for those traveling in the @entity25 -- though not necessarily because of @entity9			1
a @entity25 federal official says its customary to see increased security presence leading up to a holiday weekend , but that 's not necessarily tied to an increased terror threat			1
to that point , @entity149 spokesman @entity148 said he does n't anticipate the @entity25 terror threat level will rise anytime soon			1
and @entity25 secretary of homeland security @entity152 pointed out there is no specific threat against the @entity25			2
that said , @entity152 noted that @entity9 has proved to be a threat to @entity25 overseas -- with @entity24 's execution and the threats of more killings to follow being exhibit no. 1			1
the @entity168 " has taken a number of steps to enhance aviation security at overseas airports with direct flights to the @entity25 , and the @entity1 and other nations have followed with similar enhancements			2
" @entity169 , a former @entity170 counterterrorism director in president @entity172 's administration , acknowledged @entity9 sympathizers could lash out domestically or @entity25 who 've gone to fight with militants could bring that fight back home			2
still , that does n't mean we should expect a coordinated attack outside the @entity100 anytime soon , he said			2
" i think there is a certain amount of hyperventilation at the moment , " said @entity169 , now head of @entity182 's @entity181			0
" the long - term threat is quite serious ... but this is a group that has no track record of plotting terrorist attacks outside of its own area			0
" report : @entity9 computer included files on biological weaponry so what is @entity9 capable of -- whether it 's in the @entity100 or elsewhere ? that 's hard to answer definitively , since the group has n't lashed out outside the @entity100 like @entity70			1
a recent story in @entity203 , however , suggest that @entity9 is thinking big			0
the report talks about files on a laptop that purportedly once belonged to @entity9 before being abandoned in @entity7			2
they files reportedly include talk about biological and other such weapons , including the weaponizing of the bubonic plague			0
if these documents are legitimate , they 'd suggest that @entity9 has a grand strategy and is willing to kill thousands -- including civilians -- using weapons of mass destruction to further its aims			0
but that does n't mean the group is close to putting such plans into action			0
@entity68 terrorism analyst @entity225 cautioned that there 's a big difference between researching chemical and biological agents and creating the capability to use them			0
he noted that @entity70 tried for two decades to develop such weapons , with no apparent success			0
and there 's no evidence that @entity9 has a dedicated @entity235 program of its own , said @entity225 , who suggested the files might " just be one guy , doing research			0
" " it 's extremely hard to weaponize these kind of agents -- especially on the delivery side , " he added			0
airstrikes continue still , even if @entity9 has n't deployed or even developed chemical or biological weapons , its fighters have proven to be plenty effective with conventional weaponry			0
yet now , in @entity6 at least , @entity9 forces find themselves under fire			2
the @entity25 military has carried out 110 airstrikes in that country since august 8 , at an average cost of $ 7.5 million a day , said @entity256 spokesman rear adm. @entity255			0
that includes more strikes friday targeting @entity9 fighters near the @entity260 , according to @entity261			0
the strikes destroyed four armored vehicles , damaged one more and destroyed three support vehicles , all belonging to the terrorist group , the military said			0
@entity6 's air force continued its own assault on @entity9 - controlled @entity269 , with the militant group responding in turn			1
the bombardment killed 18 people and wounded 57 others , a @entity269 hospital official and two residents at the facility told @entity68			0
@entity255 , like the @entity1 prime minister , argued that military action alone is not enough to combat extremism			0
" if we 've learned nothing over 13 years of war , it 's that you ca n't completely eliminate extremism anywhere through simply kinetics , through airstrikes alone , " he said at a press briefing friday			2
@entity172 's no ' strategy yet ' comment on @entity9 in @entity7 sparks a political uproar			2

*ex-* @entity25 official notes @entity9 has yet to attack outside the @entity100
@entity1 terror threat hiked to second - highest level due to events in @entity6 , @entity7
@entity18 : we ca n't ignore @entity22 extremists after @entity24 's killing
spokesman : @entity25 has no plans now to raise its own terror threat level
