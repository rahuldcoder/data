@entity0 -- a cardinal from the @entity3 , another from @entity5 and an archbishop from @entity7 would be the " least worst " choices to be the next pope , according to a group representing the victims of abuse by priests			1
the @entity14 , or @entity14 , released its list thursday as cardinals held meetings at the @entity18 in a prelude to the selection of the next pontiff			1
the three are cardinal @entity23 of the @entity3 ; cardinal @entity24 of @entity5 ; and archbishop @entity25 of @entity26 , @entity7			2
@entity25 is not a cardinal , but @entity14 noted that a man need not be a cardinal to be elected pope			1
historically , the role has gone to cardinals , however			2
@entity1 @entity18 analyst @entity33 , also a correspondent for @entity34 , wrote last month that @entity24 " certainly has the right pedigree for the job			1
" and @entity23 has " been a leader in pushing the church in @entity41 to take an aggressive stance on clerical abuse , " @entity33 said in a series he wrote on the papal contenders			1
@entity23 would normally be considered too young for the role , but @entity46 's almost unprecedented resignation might have changed the way the cardinals think , he said			2
wednesday , @entity14 named its " @entity59 " list of men it judged would be the worst candidates for pope because of their handling of , or comments on , past allegations of child sex abuse against clergy			1
the scandal has shaken global confidence in the church in recent years			2
a @entity64 poll published wednesday indicates that @entity66 @entity65 see it as the biggest issue the @entity18 faces			1
asked what they think is the most important problem , 34 % of the @entity66 @entity65 questioned mention sex abuse , pedophilia or some other reference to the scandal			1
no other problem garnered more than 10 % of the responses			2
a report for @entity80 news magazine @entity79 on thursday claims that the church hierarchy was alerted to the problem decades ago , in 1965 but buried the warnings			1
' absolutely key ' since monday , the gathered cardinals have been holding meetings , known as general congregations , to discuss the most serious questions facing the church			2
the last of the cardinals summoned to choose the next pope , @entity92 @entity91 of @entity93 , arrived at the @entity18 on thursday			1
no date has been set for the conclave , or secret election , for the new pope , said the rev. @entity98 , a @entity18 spokesman			1
but cardinal @entity99 , the retired archbishop of @entity100 , suggested that the announcement might not be far away in a tweet posted thursday			2
" days of @entity103 reaching a conclusion			0
setting of date for @entity106			0
mood of excitement prevails among @entity110 , " he said			0
the 115 cardinal - electors -- those under the age of 80 who are eligible to vote for the new pontiff -- are taking time to prepare for what many see as their greatest responsibility			1
although some may be wondering why it 's taking so long to set the date for the conclave , @entity98 pushed back against the idea that the cardinals were dragging their feet			0
the discussions they are having in the general congregations are a vital part of the process , he said , since once the conclave starts there wo n't be much time between votes for reflection or the exchange of ideas			0
the cardinals have to have all the information they need in order to make a mature , responsible judgment in the election , especially at a time when the church faces complex issues , he said			1
" the preparation is absolutely key , " @entity98 said			0
celibacy for priests a hot issue , not just for church leaders @entity66 cardinals muzzled ? @entity80 media reports thursday focused on the @entity18 's move to end the news briefings held this week by @entity66 cardinals , amid concerns over leaks of confidential discussions among the cardinals			1
sister @entity157 , director of media relations for the @entity159 , wrote in a blog post that the decision wednesday came after a media report in @entity80 daily @entity163 , which gave details of who had said what			0
" i compared the shutdown to the old catholic school style of one kid talks and everyone stays after school , " she wrote , saying a similar thing happened before the last conclave in 2005			0
" we 'll continue briefings , but without cardinals , to help @entity66 media especially cover this exciting moment in the church , " @entity157 added			1
it 's been a week since @entity46 became the first pontiff in six centuries to resign from the role			0
popes usually serve until their death			0
with @entity187 around the corner , many inside the @entity65 would like to see a new pontiff in place to lead ceremonies			1
watch for the smoke : how is a new pope elected ? ' mix and mingle ' all the cardinals , including those older than 80 , are entitled to take part in the closed - door general congregations			1
@entity98 said 152 cardinals met thursday morning			0
a second meeting will take place in the afternoon , as the cardinals seek to pick up the pace before agreeing on the date for the conclave			0
thursday morning 's business included reports on the financial state of the @entity18 , @entity98 said			1
he named the cardinals who delivered the reports but did not reveal their contents			0
the cardinals could continue their meetings on saturday , @entity98 added , but are unlikely to meet sunday when @entity213 may be held			0
interactive : a look at possible papal contenders some of the discussions happen over coffee , as one @entity18 spokesman revealed monday , the first day of the general congregations			1
" there 's a coffee break for about 30 minutes at a special buffet area in the front part of the audience hall , " said the rev. @entity221			0
" @entity110 have an opportunity to go down and mix and mingle			0
" " they want to say what the next pope will hear , because he 's probably in that room , and they also want to alert the people who have n't spent so much time in @entity0 just what the situation really is here as they see it , " cardinal @entity228 of @entity229 said			1
the electors also want to go into the conclave with pretty clear ideas about whom to vote for , cardinal @entity240 of @entity241 said			2
they , too , have no interest in seeing it drag on , and there is no reason to believe that it will			0
the past 11 conclaves have lasted no longer than four days , the diocese of @entity251 , @entity252 , wrote on its website			0
that was n't always the case			0
in the 13th century , the election of one pope took two years and nine months , the diocese said			2
catholics grew so angry at the cardinals ' indecision from 1268 to 1271 , when @entity263 was elected , that they boarded them up in their chamber and tore off the roof to expose them to the elements			0
the fiasco led to the creation of the conclave and its precise protocol -- partly to expedite the process			0
what 's in a name ? clues to be found in next pope 's moniker @entity1 's @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .			2
