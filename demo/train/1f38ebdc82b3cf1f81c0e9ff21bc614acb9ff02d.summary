@entity0 -- @entity3 's rhetoric toward the @entity4 has always had a certain bizarre , over-the - top quality to it			1
under the @entity9 administration it labeled @entity11 @entity10 " human scum			0
" " complete and irreversible denuclearization is the only viable path for @entity3 , " @entity13 says			0
but the @entity3 's latest comments about secretary of state @entity13 are stunningly personal			1
an unnamed @entity3 official quoted by the state - run @entity19 news agency calls @entity21 " by no means intelligent " and a " funny lady			1
" " sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping , " he said			1
the remarks seem to be a reply to @entity21 's comments to @entity29 in which she compared @entity3 's leadership to " small children and unruly teenagers and people who are demanding attention			1
" behind the scenes , @entity4 officials for months have made similar comparisons , claiming the @entity40 's modus operandi is to be deliberately provocative , to " act out " to get the @entity4 ' attention and be rewarded for its " misbehavior			1
" this time , they say , it 's not going to work			0
@entity21 said @entity44 has " no friends left			0
" after @entity3 conducted an underground nuclear test in may and fired several ballistic missiles over @entity48 , the @entity4 rallied the @entity49 to pass resolution 1874 , which invoked strong sanctions , including targeting top @entity3 officials connected to @entity40 's nuclear program			1
significantly , the resolution was supported by @entity55 and @entity56 , countries that have been reluctant to impose strict sanctions on @entity3			2
" complete and irreversible denuclearization is the only viable path for @entity3 , " @entity21 said at the @entity60 meeting in @entity61 this week			2
" we do not intend to reward @entity3 just for returning to the table , nor do we intend to reward them for actions they have already committed to taking and then reneged on			2
the path is open to them , and it is up to them to follow it			0
unless and until they do , they will face international isolation and the unrelenting pressure of global sanctions			0
" @entity3 , however , says the six - party talks with the @entity4 , @entity78 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity48 are dead and it 's not going back			1
the country has the right to a nuclear program , it says , since it must defend itself against possible attack from the @entity4			1
with strong words on both sides , the standoff seems intractable			0
@entity21 maintains the door still is open to the @entity3 , but only if @entity44 does what it already has committed to : resume talks and dismantle its nuclear program -- completely , irreversibly and verifiably			1
" we have made it very clear to the @entity3 that if they will agree to irreversible denuclearization the @entity4 , as well as our partners , will move forward on a package of incentives and opportunities , including normalizing relations that will give the people of @entity3 a better future , " she said			2
but a @entity3 official , quoted by @entity78 news agency @entity104 , calls the package of incentives " nonsense			2
" " the @entity4 is telling us to take off all of our clothes , " he 's quoted as saying			0
" the most important thing for us is sovereignty			0
sovereignty , security , namely life , should be guaranteed			0
how can we barter life with money ? "			0

" sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl , " official *reportedly* says of @entity21
@entity4 officials have likened @entity3 's provocative actions to children acting out
@entity3 's nuclear test in may *strengthened* @entity4 call for sanctions
@entity3 remains *defiant* , showing no signs of *abandoning* nuclear program
