@entity0 , @entity1 -- the economic might of @entity1 may bring to mind technological savvy and overseas call centers			1
but to understand the @entity1 economy , a visit to a roadside dentist like @entity8 is more illuminating			1
the @entity1 economy is fueled by independent workers such as @entity11			1
" i can extract , i can fill up , i can scale , i can make dentures , i can make bridge metal or non-metal			2
" @entity8 said as he fitted dentures for a customer			2
one thing he ca n't do is show a license to practice -- like many roadside dentists sitting on sidewalks awaiting customers			1
while information technology and outsourcing has earned @entity1 the nickname as " the world 's back office , " the sector employs a fraction of @entity1 's population -- only 2 million of @entity1 's more than 500 million workers , according to @entity33 , an it and business process outsourcing trade organization			1
so where do the majority of people work in @entity1 ? the @entity39 and economists say as many as 95 percent of the workforce makes a living in what is known as the informal or unorganized sector			1
" roughly today about 50 percent of the production is from the unorganized sector , " says @entity0 - based economics professor @entity45 , referring to jobs and services that exist without a storefront , union to represent the workers , or corporate structure			1
although things are changing and the economy has boomed in recent years , @entity1 are still emerging from poverty			1
finding employment can be tough so people have literally created jobs out of sheer necessity , such as roadside dentist @entity8			1
@entity8 says he learned his trade from a dentist and a dental course but he does not have a degree in dentistry			2
he and those around him provide a service to customers who could n't dream of affording a licensed dentist in an office			2
that is just one of thousands of jobs that make up @entity1 's informal economy			1
@entity75 is a @entity76 artist			0
she uses henna to make intricate traditional designs on women 's hands and feet			0
it 's an old art that is steeped in tradition and is typically worn by brides the day before the wedding ceremony but is also popular during other @entity1 holidays and with tourists			1
she learned the trade from her sister at age 10 and started working as a teenager			0
" i started doing this work because i was needy			2
i have no parents ; my sister has done everything for me so it was very important for me to work , " said @entity75 , a mother of two , while she swirled henna on the hand of a customer			2
she makes 25 to 50 rupees ( 50 cents to $ 1 ) per hand , she said			0
she and other henna artists are often " troubled " by city authorities or police who come to kick them off of the sidewalks or ask for bribes -- technically @entity75 and others are breaking the law by setting up shop on government property			0
@entity111 government authorities showed up while @entity2 was interviewing @entity75 , causing the henna artists around her to pack up and run away			0
it 's a tough life			0
" if there can be anything better , i would definitely love to do it , " she said			0
" here there is no certainty			0
today i 'm allowed to sit here , tomorrow i may not be			0
" but @entity75 says it 's better than nothing at all			0
experts say the informal economy helped keep @entity1 out of recession , since it is not tied to the global markets			1
while the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit has help the @entity1 economy growing , the largely unregulated workforce promises to have negative impacts on the @entity1 economy as well , as transactions are often in cash and difficult to trace and tax			1
but the working conditions and low pay leave millions living in poverty			0
" their conditions are very poor because they have no protective gear of any kind , they have no real social security of any kind , " said @entity45 , an economics professor at @entity137			0
" they face a lot of hardship of all kinds in terms of their existence , where they stay , what do they do , their health conditions , et cetera			0

about 95 percent of the @entity1 workers work in the unorganized sector
they work without a storefront , union representation or corporate structure
often roadside services such as *unlicensed* denistry are practiced
