-- @entity1 , whose disclosures have triggered broad debate over the balance between privacy and national security , has left @entity7 and is in @entity8 , apparently headed to @entity9			1
@entity7 and the @entity10 have issued different stories about whether @entity7 authorities had enough information to prevent @entity1 's departure			1
@entity8 says since @entity1 remained in transit through the @entity8 airport , he could not have been detained by them			1
@entity19 and @entity20 seem delighted to facilitate @entity1 's passage			1
@entity1 's supporters assert a moral equivalence between surveillance by the @entity25 and surveillance by @entity19 , @entity20 and other authoritarian regimes			1
this equivalence posits that surveillance by any nation , for whatever reason , whether of its citizens or of other nations , is morally equivalent			1
to pure privacy advocates , the use of surveillance makes no difference			0
the mere fact that @entity39 is watching is the central commonality			0
this is a mistaken view of surveillance			0
in the @entity25 , the @entity43 distinguishes between @entity25 persons and non- @entity25 persons			1
it allows only metadata collection on the former : the origins , destinations and length of calls but not their contents			0
the volume of data is so enormous that no government official 's prying eyes have access to what you or i say			0
opinion : why @entity9 might shelter @entity1 computer algorithms sort the data , and additional safeguards exist when that data needs to be accessed by analysts , agents or officers to comply with @entity70 requirements			2
the entire process operates under an umbrella of approval and oversight by an elected @entity75 , is vetted by privacy attorneys in the @entity10 and is overseen by life - tenured federal judges			0
the watchers are the agents of the people			0
if president @entity81 himself asked for data concerning an individual citizen , resident alien or casual visitor to the @entity25 , the request would be vetted and denied if it did not meet probable cause requirements of the @entity70			2
the @entity43 statute explicitly protects first amendment rights to free speech , which include criticisms of government policy and peaceful protests against government actions			0
it also requires minimal privacy intrusions -- however inadvertently -- of @entity25 persons			2
the national surveillance state , to borrow a term from legal scholar @entity101 , is closely tethered to the rule of law and accountability to the people			2
contrast surveillance in authoritarian regimes			1
@entity19 closely monitors its citizens ' access to political information , and dissidents of all varieties are targeted at the whim of the unelected @entity114 leadership			1
the constitution is not judicially enforceable , so no independent authority can say no to a request of the party leadership			0
no opposing party can make political hay over surveillance of its advocates and adherents			2
or consider @entity20 , where president @entity126 's minions , again without judicial oversight or significant independent political opposition , can monitor and imprison those who oppose his regime 's policies			1
freedom of speech , and especially political speech , is closely cabined by the regime			0
the contents of communications found through electronic surveillance or otherwise can rapidly lead to imprisonment or house arrest			0
and defection , a cousin of espionage , can lead to polonium poisoning			0
in short , there is a world of difference between the @entity25 and @entity19 or @entity20 when it comes to surveillance			1
the @entity25 analyzes data to prevent terrorist violence to its people , while authoritarian regimes use surveillance to cabin political dissent by their people			1
but what about @entity25 electronic espionage directed at @entity19 e-mail contents , communications of @entity20 's president and @entity162 interception of communications of individuals thought to be @entity166 terrorists , also revealed by @entity1 's disclosures ? opinion : why @entity25 is being humiliated by the hunt for @entity1 these electronic intercepts concern the contents of communications , not just the fact of communications			1
and these intercepts do not respect the privacy or political free speech of the communicators			0
the difference is that snooping on foreign nations and alleged terrorists furthers national security , the most basic reason for the existence of the @entity25			2
national security pervades the @entity184 , from the preamble 's purpose to " provide for the common defense " to designation of the president as commander in chief			0
it is nothing new for the executive branch , again under rules established by @entity75 and often subject to independent judicial oversight , to direct espionage against those who may seek to harm this country			0
aliens outside the @entity25 and the leadership of foreign countries are " fair game " for surveillance , and they have no @entity70 or @entity203 rights			1
moreover , foreign countries know as much or more , often from the public record , of @entity25 defensive capabilities			2
as justice @entity209 dissented more than 60 years ago , the @entity184 is not " a suicide pact			0
" some may think @entity1 's destination immaterial			2
but if he lands in a regime that represses its own people and seeks to further harm the @entity25 , might the @entity25 consider ratcheting up the diplomatic pressure beyond genteel mechanisms of criminal extradition to fulfill its mandate to " provide for the common defense ? " instead of the @entity10 writing a criminal complaint to begin a federal criminal process where @entity1 could avail himself of all his constitutional rights , could the @entity25 consider other options to protect its national security ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			1

@entity228 : some think that surveillance by any nation is morally equivalent
@entity226 : surveillance by the @entity25 is *vastly* different from that of authoritarian regimes
he says @entity20 or @entity19 uses surveillance to cabin political dissent by their people
@entity226 : if @entity1 ends up in a nation that seeks to harm the @entity25 , it spells trouble
