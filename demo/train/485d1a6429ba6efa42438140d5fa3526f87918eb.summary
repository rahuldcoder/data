@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity3 and now @entity4			2
president @entity5 faces a third front of vulnerability on his administration 's record of defending human rights with the muddled situation involving activist @entity12			1
with his re-election campaign just hitting full stride , @entity5 hoped to capitalize on foreign policy successes , such as last year 's raid that killed @entity17 , to blunt @entity19 attacks on the sluggish @entity21 economic recovery			0
however , the increasingly strange and challenging case of @entity12 provides potential fresh fodder for opponents to continue their attempts to portray the @entity5 presidency as soft or acquiescing to brutal regimes that abuse their own people			0
presumptive @entity19 presidential nominee @entity30 led the attack thursday , saying at a campaign event that circumstances of the incident -- if true -- meant a " dark day for freedom , and it 's a day of shame for the @entity5 administration			0
" conservative republicans such as sen. @entity39 of @entity40 have criticized the @entity5 administration for not providing strong support for @entity2 protesters last year or the @entity3 opposition movement in its ongoing conflict with forces of president @entity46			0
" ultimately , ending violations of conscience requires the political will and moral courage of world leaders , especially the president of the @entity21 , " @entity39 said last week			0
" unfortunately , that will and leadership are lacking in the case of @entity3 today			0
" @entity12 's case casts new light on @entity4 's history of political persecution and rights abuses and comes at a particularly delicate time as @entity21 secretary of state @entity62 and treasury secretary @entity63 arrived this week for long - planned talks on strategic and economic issues			1
@entity12 : ' i want to go to the @entity21 ' the blind , self - taught human rights attorney has been persecuted by @entity4 authorities for years for his work exposing the government 's policy restricting the number of children a couple may have , mistreatment of disabled people and other abuses			1
he escaped from house arrest last month and took refuge in the @entity80 in @entity81 , setting off a behind - the - scenes diplomatic effort intended to prevent the situation from derailing the top - level meetings with @entity85 and @entity63			2
on wednesday , all seemed resolved when the 40 - year - old @entity12 left the embassy to join his family at a @entity81 hospital , with @entity21 officials saying that he never requested asylum and that @entity4 gave assurances that he and his family would not face further persecution			1
that quickly unraveled at the hospital , where @entity12 said he wanted @entity21 help to flee @entity4 with his family because he feared for their safety			1
the situation has tested the @entity5 administration 's approach to relations with @entity4 , straining its commitment to uphold human rights even as it strives to maintain steady ties with @entity81			1
last week , when @entity12 was still inside the embassy , @entity21 officials refused to confirm his location and @entity5 declined to comment directly on the case when asked about it at a news conference			2
in comments thursday at the high - level talks with @entity4 , @entity85 made no mention of @entity12 while saying the topic of human rights was part of the discussion			1
a senior @entity117 official said thursday the @entity21 will do what it can to help @entity12 and his family leave @entity4 if they want to , but added that @entity0 does n't have " a magic wand " to get him out of the country			1
at the @entity124 , press secretary @entity123 referred questions about the situation in @entity4 to the @entity117			2
@entity123 repeated details previously released by @entity117 officials that @entity12 never asked for asylum while in the @entity80 and was never pressured to leave			0
@entity30 , however , said news reports indicated that @entity21 officials may have sped up @entity12 's decision to leave the embassy " because they wanted to move on to a series of discussions that mr. @entity63 and our secretary of state are planning on having with @entity4			1
" he also complained that the embassy failed to put in place " the kind of verifiable measures that would assure the safety of mr. @entity12 and his family			0
" " we are a place of freedom here and around the world , and we should stand up and defend freedom wherever it is under attack , " @entity30 said			0
@entity151 , spokesman for the @entity5 campaign , said @entity30 's thursday comments rang hollow			0
" he has no coherent foreign policy vision , no concrete plans to enhance our security and strengthen our alliances , and he has taken conflicting positions on every major foreign policy issue facing our nation , " @entity151 said in a statement			0
" rather than leveling these empty political attacks at the president , @entity30 should tell the @entity21 people exactly what he would do as commander in chief			0
" a statement by @entity124 speaker @entity168 , @entity169 , said that " the @entity21 has an obligation to stand with the oppressed , not with the oppressor			0
" " having handed @entity12 back over to the @entity4 government , the @entity5 administration is responsible for ensuring his safety , " @entity168 's statement said			2
" while our economic relationship with @entity4 is important and vital to the future of people in both countries , the @entity21 has an obligation to use its engagement with @entity4 to press for reforms in @entity4 's human rights practices , particularly with respect to the reprehensible ' one - child ' policy			1
" human rights groups and some members of @entity189 are pressuring the @entity5 administration to help @entity12 and his family get out			1
noting the presence of @entity85 in @entity4 for the talks , @entity191 rep. @entity191 of @entity192 called for the @entity5 administration to do " everything it can to ensure that @entity12 , his family members and all those who have helped him are removed from harm 's way			2
" " they must seize this golden opportunity to help save @entity12 and his family and demonstrate to the world that the ( @entity21 ) stands firm for fundamental human rights and the rule of law , " said @entity191 , the chairman of the @entity201			1
" trade talks are important , but human rights are not ' an irritant ' -- we have a duty to protect and defend			2
" later thursday , @entity191 chaired an emergency hearing on the issue that included a telephone conversation with @entity12 from @entity81 amplified by holding a cellular phone up to a hearing room microphone			0
speaking to @entity12 , @entity191 called his case a test of the @entity4 government 's commitment to protect him and " also a test of the @entity21 as to whether or not human rights really do matter			1
" @entity123 , repeatedly asked about the issue by reporters at the @entity124 daily briefing , said the president is " not concerned about political back - and - forth on this issue			0
" " he is focused on the need to advance @entity21 interests in our relationship with @entity4 " and to make " an open and frank discussion on human rights " part of that relationship , @entity123 said			1
human rights advocacy groups raised doubts about whether @entity81 would stick to the promises it reportedly made regarding @entity12 's ability to live free of persecution in @entity4			1
@entity4 officials did not comment directly on what deal had been reached with the @entity21 over @entity12			2
in comments reported by state media , they focused on what they described as " interference " by @entity0 in @entity4 's internal affairs			0
to @entity251 , director of the @entity252 and a senior fellow in foreign policy at the @entity255 , the balance of human rights issues such as the @entity12 case with other significant issues for both the @entity21 and @entity4 marked a maturing of relations between the countries			1
" the juxtaposition of a classic human rights issue with these other issues highlights the range of our relationship and our capacity now to do what @entity21 policy has sought -- which is to deal with these issues separately so that problems in any one part of the relationship do n't disrupt our ability to address very important issues in other parts of the relationship , " @entity251 said on the @entity255 website			1
" that 's what a mature relationship is about			2
" a co-author of a book on @entity5 's foreign policy published in march , @entity251 said the balanced approach by @entity0 " does not mean , as some in the advocacy community have said , that this means that effectively we do n't give much priority to human rights			2
" " what it does mean is that we give priority to human rights , we give priority to nuclear proliferation , we give priority to cybersecurity , we give priority to jobs and economic growth in the @entity21 and how @entity4 's economic polices affect that , " said @entity251 , a former @entity289 professor who was a special adviser on national security affairs to president @entity85			1
" we have a series of priorities , each of which we pursue vigorously , and i think that 's the right way to do it			0
" @entity123 seemed to agree thursday , telling reporters : " we are continuing to pursue our broad agenda with @entity4 on a whole range of issues			0
" @entity1 's @entity312 contributed to this report .			0
