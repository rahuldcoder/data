-- @entity2 users have gotten at least a two - week reprieve during which the file - sharing company says it hopes their files and other stored data can be retrieved , not deleted			1
the news comes days after a federal prosecutor said user data on the site , which is accused of knowingly hosting illegally pirated material , could be deleted as early as this week			1
