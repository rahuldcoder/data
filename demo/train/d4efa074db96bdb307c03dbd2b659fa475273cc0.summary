what if this is it ? after 13 days of searching amid fears that @entity5 may never be found , investigators said thursday that satellites have beamed down a ray of hope -- images of a debris field floating in the southern @entity11 that may show wreckage of the jet			1
it was not immediately clear just how long it would take before investigators could track down just what those images are			2
still , " it is probably the best lead we have right now , " said @entity19 , a spokesman for the @entity20			1
@entity25 authorities poring over images that were shot sunday spotted the debris floating in one of the world 's most remote places -- the southern @entity11 more than 1,500 miles off the southwest coast of @entity25			1
the images were brought to the authority 's attention thursday morning , it said			1
the find warranted attention from the @entity25 prime minister			1
" two possible objects related to the search have been identified , " @entity38 told parliament			2
but satellites have been wrong about flight 370 before			1
and @entity25 authorities warn that the pictures , too , could end in a goose chase and disappointment			1
if the photographs do show wreckage of the @entity51 that departed @entity52 on march 8 and never arrived in @entity53 , what would be next ? locate the first mission is to find the " blob , " as @entity19 called it			1
one piece of the debris is 24 meters ( 79 feet ) long			1
" the size and fact that there are a number located in the same area really makes it worth looking at , " he said			2
" our experience is that there is debris out there -- from ships , for example , falling overboard , " he said			1
" i do n't want to speculate about what they are until we get there and we see them			0
" one expert said that might happen soon			0
" i would say a day -- guessing , " said capt. @entity79 , president of @entity80 and an ocean search expert			0
time is critical , given that the batteries powering the pings emanating from the plane 's voice and data recorders go dead after about 30 days			1
" there 's a clock ticking , " @entity79 said			1
" maybe 18 days left			0
" overcome complications complicating the search -- which the @entity20 suspended thursday night and will resume friday morning -- is the fact that the debris field is probably far away from where it was when it was spotted in satellite images shot four days ago			1
" it could have drifted a thousand miles , " he said			0
and he noted , too , that the debris may be unrelated			1
" it could be just a false lead , " @entity79 told @entity103 's " @entity102			1
" @entity104 , senior fellow at @entity105 and an expert on @entity25 radar , agreed			1
" i 'm a little bit pessimistic , " he told " @entity102			0
" he said the debris might be one of the ubiquitous cargo containers carried by ships around the world			1
" it 's not at all inconceivable that that 's exactly what it is , " he said , adding that other satellites have been steered to the area to get a better view			1
" the problem now is we do n't know exactly where " it is , he said			0
and poor visibility has not helped			0
" it 's still really hard , in this kind of environment , to pick out these little semi-submerged blips , " he said			1
" you 're looking for something that is potentially not even there anymore			0
" search four planes were involved in thursday 's search , which covered 8,880 square miles ( 23,000 square kilometers ) about 1,600 miles ( 2,500 kilometers ) southwest of @entity135 , according to the @entity20			1
an @entity25 plane has flown over the area , and more planes were on their way , including at least one from the @entity141 and one from @entity143			1
but the planes burn much of their fuel just to get to the remote spot , leaving them little time to search			2
" we are in the most isolated part of the world , " @entity25 defense minister @entity148 told @entity149			1
if pilots do find the field , they would drop a buoy to mark the spot and to transmit data to help ships find it , aviation expert @entity153 said			1
but the area is known for high winds , and white - capped waves could obscure any debris , he added			2
and on top of that , a storm in the area may have foiled one flyover			0
the crew of a @entity171 p - 3 orion was unable to find the objects , the @entity20 said in a tweet			2
clouds and rain made things hard to see			0
@entity177 " what we 're looking for is a confirmation that it does belong to the aircraft , or it does not , " @entity19 said			0
if a ship reaches the suspected wreckage , it would take some of it back to land for inspection , he said			0
but the expanse of ocean contains a mass of floating garbage from around the world , which could mingle with any plane parts			2
recover in a stroke of luck for investigators , a @entity195 merchant cargo vessel carrying 19 sailors and a cargo of cars reached the suspected debris location and is pitching in on the search			2
" all men are on deck to continue the search , " said @entity204 , a spokesman for the @entity205 , in a telephone interview with @entity103 , adding that they were planning to work through the night in shifts , using lights and binoculars			1
" it 's ok weather , with some fog , " he said			1
the 755 - foot ( 230 - meter ) @entity216 is owned by @entity217			0
it had been headed to @entity219 , @entity25 , from @entity220 when it diverted to help in the search , he said			1
its presence opens great possibilities , said former @entity227 counterterrorism expert @entity226			0
it could serve as a base for the salvage teams , especially if it is equipped for helicopter landings , which @entity204 said might be possible , given that the ship has a flat deck			0
if refueled in the air , the choppers could carry divers to the ship , and they could search for any debris			2
asked how long it would remain on site , @entity204 said , " it will be there as long as required ... at least all of tomorrow			0
" another merchant ship arrived in the area thursday evening , the maritime authority said			0
in all , six merchant ships have aided in the search since an appeal was issued monday night			0
and the @entity249 ship @entity248 was en route to the search area on thursday			0
the issue of the remaining lifetime of the batteries powering the cockpit recorder and flight data recorder looms			0
they were stored inside the tail of the jetliner			0
if the tail is found , it may have to be disassembled			0
@entity263 rescuers have underscored to @entity265 's leaders the importance of finding the recorders quickly , said @entity268 , @entity265 's acting transportation minister			2
after @entity270 went down in the @entity271 in 2009 , it took two years and a special submarine for investigators to find them			2
@entity265 does not have that submarine technology , which makes finding the data recorders before the signals fail all the more important , he added			0
analyze the recorders could be invaluable to investigators trying to find out what happened to the flight			2
the flight data recorder holds about 17,000 pieces of information , said @entity285 , author of " @entity286 : an accident investigator fights for @entity288			0
" and then there is the cockpit recording			0
though it keeps only two hours of recordings , it too could prove key			0
" the last two hours of what happened before this aircraft impacted could be really important to determine whether or not there was foul play , " he said			2
keep an open mind the searchers have not put all of their resources into hunting for the tantalizing debris			1
on thursday , four aircraft continued to search along the northern corridor , and 25 aircraft and 18 ships were searching along the southern corridor , @entity268 said			0
" until we are certain that we have located @entity5 , search and rescue operations will continue in both corridors , " he said			1
@entity313 was using 21 satellites to search within its borders , the airline said			2
live : updates on the missing @entity318 jetliner			0

" it 's ok weather , with some fog , " @entity205 spokesman says
@entity25 satellites have spotted a field of debris floating in the @entity11
first , searchers must find the debris and mark the spot
second , they must see the debris to determine if it is from @entity5
