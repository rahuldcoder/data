-- this is how it generally works : @entity3 or @entity4 screams " live from @entity5 , it 's saturday night ! " the house band kicks in , the immortal @entity8 announces the cast			2
and then , the stage door opens , and a smiling celebrity walks out towards the camera			2
you try and gauge her body language because what you really want to know is : is this going to be funny ? it 's late on saturday night and you just need to know whether you 're going to watch this from start to finish right now ... or whether you should go to bed and simply scan through " @entity21 " tomorrow on the @entity22			2
like a football or basketball game , a host ca n't " win " " snl " with a great opening monologue , but he or she sure can screw it up			1
so it 's no surprise that the best hosts typically come out of the gate revving on all cylinders			1
good jokes help , and so do pratfalls , but the best of the best remind us that this is live television			2
it can be messy , and it can even be a trainwreck			2
but whatever it is , it ca n't be boring			2
' @entity43 ' best - host contest : who deserves a second chance ? for the second straight year , @entity0 readers have voted to determine who was " @entity43 's " best host			1
throughout the show 's season , the most recent host was pitted against the four most popular previous hosts in a vote , and the one with the least number of voters was eliminated while the four survivors advanced to the next week			1
like any democracy , it 's a system that 's not without its flaws			2
this year , we rigged modified the system with what i call the @entity65 , which restored a previously eliminated host to the final vote			1
the electorate rescued @entity70 to join our final five : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
i 've said before that there are very few happy accidents on " @entity43			1
live comedy is a gauntlet that can expose and undermine the proudest of entertainers			2
each of our finalists , however , delivered monologues that set the tone for excellent shows that showcased the best of their abilities			2
' @entity43 ' finale recap : @entity75 shines , but @entity93 and @entity94 steal the show more importantly for the success of the show , all of them also had a blast			1
i mean , it 's possible they were terrified underneath , but once the show began , all six of them were giggly and daring and totally committed			2
they 're good at hosting because they embrace the experience , trusting the writers and trusting their own talent			0
before we announce the winner of mr. ( or mrs. ) saturday night 2013 , though , there are four other non-democratic awards to present			0
most underrated host : @entity117 ( november 3 ) it helps , of course , if you think @entity117 is a comic genius , but even if you 're not tuned in to his brand of comedy , his first time hosting had a refreshingly off - beat vibe			1
some hosts come in to @entity126 and adhere to the proven formula and trust the writers to protect them			1
you almost got the sense that @entity117 came with his own ideas â € ” and the writing staff gave the comic 's comic a wide berth to make the show his own			0
it was n't perfect , but it felt like a @entity117 joint			0
the monologue was a seven - minute stand - up bit on helping an ancient , disoriented @entity141 lady get to her airplane on time , and the show wrapped up with the original " @entity146 " sketch , co-starring @entity147			0
in between there was the brilliant " @entity150 " short and the glorious " @entity151 " - inspired misfire			0
( the latter literally gets funnier every time you watch it ... because it has to			0
) @entity117 lasted a few weeks in our voting contest before being eliminated by @entity157 , but if he hosts again next year he 's a total must - watch , especially with one show under his belt			1
best first - time host : @entity70 ( september 15 ) in some ways , @entity163 's first appearance on " @entity43 " was an audition for the @entity166			1
less than a month after hosting the season premiere , the @entity166 announced that the creative force behind " @entity169 " and " @entity170 " would host @entity171 's biggest night			1
on " snl , " he sang , he provided voices , he mimicked celebrities			0
he did everything every host tries to do â € ” he just did all of them well			1
actually , i suspect @entity163 is one of those whose second and third shows will be even better than his promising debut , in which he leaned on the easy references his biggest fans would most appreciate			0
with those out of the way , he should be even freer and more unpredictable the next time he visits			0
@entity188 will return to ' snl ' this fall , leave for ' @entity189 ' in 2014 @entity190 : @entity191 ( april 13 ) there was a long sad stretch this season where every action star and @entity166 nominee seemed eager to prove his versatility by singing during his " snl " monologue			0
i 'll admit it is sorta funny when someone like quarterback @entity202 tries something this outlandish , but if you 're an entertainer to start with , you have to be a-maze - ing at singing or dancing to get me to give two hoots about your hidden talent			0
@entity191 went in a completely different direction , wheeling out the classic , rat - tat - tat " swingers " / " @entity211 " @entity191 who likes to perform without a net			0
was his interaction with the audience scripted ? was it half - scripted ? was it totally ad - libbed ? for a few seconds , i was sweating for him			0
but as time went on , he seemed perfectly in control			0
i dug it in a very serious way			0
if it was simply @entity191 being @entity191 , then kudos			0
but if it was the writers , then bully for them			0
best sketch starring the host : " homeland , " with @entity229 if you were n't a viewer of @entity235 's " homeland , " which stars @entity236 as an unstable @entity238 operative intimately involved with her most dangerous suspect , this sketch was likely four minutes of scrunched noses and raised eyebrows			1
but if you were obsessed with the show , like the nearly 6 million people who watched the season two finale , @entity229 's impression of jazz - freakout @entity243 was one of the most perceptive caricatures " snl " has ever showcased			0
@entity229 even took time during her farewell later that night to apologize to @entity252 for poking fun , but she had absolutely nothing to be sorry about			0
can we hope " homeland " is in the middle of a season again the next time @entity229 gets the call ? the 2013 mrs. ( or mr. ) saturday night is ... ... @entity72			1
@entity72 's episode , which featured him being inducted into the @entity264 , had the look and feel of a coronation			1
the show occurred at the center of a @entity72 promotional blitz that was anything but subtle â € ” he even spent an entire week on " @entity189 " with his " history of rap " partner @entity273			1
on his much - hyped return to " snl , " he dominated the cold - open as @entity276 , reunited with @entity277 to meet two wild and crazy @entity279 brothers , and brought his foam mascot get - up to @entity281			0
even @entity283 cynics struggled to complain			0
@entity73 was the runner - up for the second consecutive year			1
( you know the saying , always a " bridesmaid ... " ) but she 's certainly now on the short list of essential hosts , along with @entity72 , @entity289 , @entity74 , @entity290 and @entity291 ( who by the way , despite popping up for frequent cameos lately , has n't hosted since 2010 )			1
of course , the person i 'm already looking forward to hosting next season was a cast member just five days ago			0
@entity299 will be missed , and i suspect he 'll want to take some time before he returns to the show as a host			2
nevertheless , it 's tempting to circle september 27 on the calendar , the day that " @entity302 " arrives in theaters			0
@entity299 exits ' @entity43 ' thanks again for voting throughout the year , and congratulations to @entity72 , mr. saturday night 2013			1
