-- @entity3 winner @entity1 won the 139th running of the @entity5 in @entity6 on saturday with a burst at the homestretch -- moving a step closer to the illustrious and elusive @entity10			1
@entity1 was heavily favored in the 10 - horse field			1
with @entity14 riding , the colt held off a hard - charging ride on @entity16 to take the second jewel in the @entity10			1
now , with the @entity3 and @entity5 victories , if @entity1 wins the @entity20 next month in @entity21 , he 'll be the first horse since @entity23 in 1978 to achieve the ultimate feat in thoroughbred racing			1
a former bus driver in his native @entity27 , @entity28 , 41 , has ridden in the @entity5 six times , including on @entity30 in 2002			1
after winning both the @entity3 and @entity5 that year , @entity30 finished eighth in the @entity20			1
" it is an awesome feeling to be able to have a horse like @entity1 , " @entity28 told @entity31 after the race			1
" it was just a crazy race ... i got more tired mentally than physically riding him			0
but it worked out well , and he 's just an amazing horse			0
" @entity41 describes @entity1 in no uncertain terms : " pure and simple , he 's a rock star			2
" the 77 - year - old trainer says the horse loves posing for pictures , loves the buzz of the track			2
after the race , @entity41 had tears rolling under his dark sunglasses			0
" i knew we had to run harder this race , " he told @entity31			0
" he 's a real racehorse and i 'm hoping that the mile and half [ in @entity20 ] is up his alley , too ... it 's a dream for any trainer to do this			2
" of the 38 horses that won both the @entity3 and @entity5 , only 11 went on to victory in the @entity20 , which covers a greater distance than either of the preceding @entity10 races			1
the winning colt even has his own official @entity71 handle : @ calchrome			0
after the race came this tweet : " start spreading the news # @entity72 we are going to @entity21 ! " @entity1 was delivered by a mare named @entity78 that @entity79 and co-owner @entity80 bought for $ 8,000 with a view to breeding			2
she was bred to the stallion @entity84 for a reduced fee of $ 2,000 , the first breeding the novice pair had ever undertaken			0
their offspring had earned @entity79 and @entity80 more than $ 2.3 million in prize money before the @entity5 , also chalking up wins at the @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
@entity1 is being compared by some to @entity95 , the beloved , undersized bay who -- though he never competed in a @entity10 race -- outran @entity10 winner @entity99 in a match race at @entity101 in 1938 and became a symbol of hope and determination			1
" i do believe he 's that , like @entity95 , " @entity79 said			0
" he became the people 's horse in the @entity109 because he was the little guy kicking the big guy			0
we 're doing that in the same kind of way			0
no one ever gave it any credence , and we should n't be where we are now			0
" @entity1 will try to win that final jewel at @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity21 , on june 7			2
" you know what ? " @entity28 said , " we 'll get it done			2
" @entity125 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 winner @entity1 moves a step closer to @entity10
@entity1 held off @entity131 in the 10 - horse field
*jockey* @entity14 will get his second shot at the @entity10
@entity28 rode @entity30 to @entity3 , @entity5 wins in 2002 , but did n't win @entity20
