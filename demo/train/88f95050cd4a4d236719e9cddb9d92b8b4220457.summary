a new indictment against @entity4 , 43 , provides new details of the attack and what federal prosecutors say was his role in leading 20 armed men in the attacks carried out over more than seven hours			1
previously , prosecutors charged him with a single count of providing material support to terrorists			1
according to the indictment , @entity4 conspired with others " on or before sept. 11 , 2012 " to attack the @entity9 diplomatic post			1
" he believed the facility was being used to collect intelligence , that he viewed the @entity9 intelligence actions in @entity10 as illegal , " the document said			1
