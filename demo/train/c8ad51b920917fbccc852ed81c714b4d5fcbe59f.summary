-- it 's the @entity2 beauty pageant , but not as you know it			2
the swimsuit competition is out , volatile farm animals are in , and there are enough leather dresses to furnish a small sofa store			0
hold onto your hats and saddle - up because this is @entity13			2
the roughest , toughest beauty pageant in the country , where leather - clad ladies must not only display poise , beauty and knowledge -- but gutsy horsemanship			2
as 1973 queen @entity21 said : " @entity13 is the ultimate cowgirl -- wholesome , beautiful and tough as nails			1
" so what does it take to wear the coveted cowgirl crown ? child 's play for reigning @entity13 , 23 - year - old @entity28 , the journey to rodeo royalty began as a youngster growing up on her parents ' ranch in @entity34 , @entity35			1
" both my parents participated in rodeo and i started competing in youth associations when i was six , " she told @entity0 , adding : " i started ' queening ' when i was eight years old , going through the ranks of different county titles			2
" the bubbly blonde took the title of @entity43 last year			2
then it was on to @entity46 ' glittering @entity45 for the @entity13 pageant , held as part of the annual @entity49 -- or as @entity28 described it : " @entity50			1
" @entity46 lock down here , 31 glamorous girls aged between 18 and 25 , spend a week strutting their @entity53 wardrobe , answering questions on everything from world politics to equine science , and riding horses in a packed arena			2
the first major test for many of the girls however , is coping with the intense scrutiny without the comforts of home			0
" once you arrive you 're not allowed to speak to family or friends			0
you have to turn in your cell phone , " explained @entity28			1
" as miss @entity13 you travel a lot on your own , and the judges want to see you can handle that pressure			0
" no horsing around miss @entity74 must be many things -- pretty , personable and educated			0
but above all she must be a master horse rider able to perform at hundreds of rodeo events across the country			1
rodeo has a grand tradition in the southern agricultural states of @entity74 , where cowboys and girls compete in various livestock challenges such as calf roping and bronco riding			1
indeed , many talented cowboys have turned their hand to professional horse racing , such as multimillion dollar jockey @entity89 from @entity90 who started out in the rodeo ring before moving to the race track			0
while other traditional beauty pageant contestants might show off their special talent by singing or playing the piano , @entity93 must demonstrate her superior riding skills by jumping on the back of a horse she 's never seen before , and performing a set routine in front of hundreds of spectators			1
" to prepare before the contest , i asked people in my home town if i could ride their horse , " said @entity28			1
" as miss @entity13 you 're traveling 100,000 miles across the country performing at rodeos -- and many of those are full of horses you 're not familiar with			1
" ladies in leather but it 's not enough to just prove yourself in the saddle			0
the ultimate cowgirl also has to look the part -- and that means rhinestones , tassels and a lot of leather			1
gazing at the ladies lined up on @entity127 's grand stage is a bit like coming face - to - face with a human rainbow of bejeweled leather , each carefully crafted costume topped - off with an obligatory cream cowboy hat			0
as @entity28 says : " a rodeo queen always has a leather dress in her wardrobe			1
it 's a good western heritage dress			0
" the fashion segment of the pageant also gives the girls a chance to design an outfit and " put their own personality in to it			0
" @entity28 opted for a bronze , floor - length leather dress with rhinestones and tassel trim			1
fit for a queen of course the ladies are n't just judged on their fashion choices -- but how they look in them			0
this , after all , is a beauty pageant , with each contestant an immaculate vision of glossy make - up , blow - dried hair and mega-watt smile			0
" we are the face of rodeo , so you always want to be representing yourself in the best way possible , " said @entity28			1
" i do n't believe it exploits women			0
there 's more behind it than a pretty face -- we have to be well - spoken , knowledgeable , and it 's a great way to further our education and career			0
" rodeo riches for radiology student @entity28 , winning the crown was a childhood dream come true , but also the beginning of a year - long commitment involving up to 200 appearances across the country			1
she 'll return to university next year with $ 22,500 in scholarship prize money , and plans to pursue a degree in business and marketing			0
it can be hard spending so much time on the road away from family and friends			0
but @entity28 also takes her job as role model to younger girls very seriously			1
" @entity93 was formed as a way to bring a little bit of beauty and grace to a sport known for its roughness and rowdiness , " she says , adding : " but you still have to be prepared to get dirt in your nails			2
