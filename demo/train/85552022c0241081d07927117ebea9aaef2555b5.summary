@entity0 -- the first 13 rules of basketball sold friday for more than $ 4 million , setting a record for the highest sales price for sports memorabilia , according to @entity7 's , which conducted the auction			1
the auction house had estimated that dr. @entity15 's two - page " @entity14 " would bring less than half the $ 4,338,500 that @entity11 and @entity12 bid for the 119 - year - old document			1
" this is the birth certificate			0
it started here , " said @entity17 , @entity7 's vice president for manuscripts and books department			0
@entity15 , a @entity22 physical education instructor working at a @entity23 , created the game of " @entity25 " so students could play a sport indoors in winter			1
@entity15 had no idea his invention would catch on so rapidly after the @entity23 movement introduced it on an international level			1
but the game has changed considerably since @entity15 's days			1
@entity15 wanted the game to have no physical contact between players and to encourage sportsmanship			1
how far it 's come : after a recent pickup game , president @entity38 received 12 stitches on his lip , proving that the contemporary game of basketball is tougher than it was in 1891			1
the first game was played with nine players on each team and a soccer ball they lobbed into peach baskets secured about 10 feet off the floor on either end of a gymnasium			2
players could only pass the ball , no dribbling			0
a foul was called for carrying the ball , holding it against the body or hitting it with a fist or for any physical contact with an opposing player			0
and contact with an opposing player with " evident intent to injure the person " resulted in the offending player being " disqualified " for the rest of the game , with no substitution			2
the booths hope to bring @entity15 's rules to the @entity72 , inspired , they said , by lifelong @entity74 basketball fan @entity73 and his campaign to return the rules the university , where @entity15 spent the last 41 years of his life and is buried			1
@entity79 , a billionaire who is chairman and co-ceo of a @entity82 mutual fund company , said the purchase is a " challenge to the @entity72			2
" " as soon as they create a venue to house it and persuade us that they will maintain it , we will give them the papers , " said @entity79 , who has an undergraduate degree from the school			0
" in the meantime , we will keep them in a vault			0
" @entity79 , who said college basketball is his favorite sport , said the $ 4 million - plus he is spending for the rules is " absolutely worth it			1
" " it is an incredibly important document , " he said			2
" i am donating it because it is the right thing to do			0
" @entity15 " invented the game , and so these papers should be there , " he said			1
" i hope there is enough support at @entity72 that they really want it			2
" @entity15 came to @entity72 in 1898 after earning a medical degree in @entity111			1
he coached the first @entity113 basketball teams and later became the school 's athletic director			2
he coached the legendary @entity116 , who succeeded @entity15 as @entity113 coach in 1920 , remaining at the helm through 36 years and three national championships			1
at @entity72 , @entity116 , in turn , coached other legendary basketballers : @entity122 , head coach at the @entity124 for 36 years , and @entity125 , head coach at the @entity127 for 42 years			1
ironically , @entity15 is the only @entity113 basketball coach to compile a losing record			1
after @entity15 's death in 1939 , the family held onto the 13 rules of the game in a safe deposit box at various locations			1
in that time , basketball has become one of the biggest businesses in sports			2
players earn millions of dollars in salaries			0
" the greed factor is getting quite strong			0
people are making an awful lot of money in the game and have a tendency to lose , in our opinion , the values , " said @entity142 , the founder 's youngest grandson			0
the family has always been involved in the game of basketball , but after many offers , it is " time to move forward , " said @entity15 , now living outside @entity157			1
@entity1 invited @entity7 's to bring the rules thursday to @entity0 's @entity159 , where the @entity160 were preparing to take on the @entity161			0
" they 're cool , " exclaimed @entity160 coach @entity162			0
" it 's a game that 's been awfully good to me and a lot of other people			0
so the rules are special , " said former @entity160 coach @entity168 , now with the @entity161			0
the proceeds from the auction will go to the @entity172			0
the humanitarian foundation promotes @entity15 's legacy of encouraging good sportsmanship , positive role models , higher education and services for underprivileged children			2
