-- an @entity2 court on thursday confirmed the death sentences of a business tycoon and a former police officer convicted of killing rising @entity7 pop star @entity6			1
@entity8 , a real estate mogul , has been found guilty of @entity6 's murder			1
in a case that has captivated @entity2 and the region because of the fame of the victim and one of the defendants , a judge sentenced to death real estate mogul @entity8 and former officer @entity18 last month			1
@entity20 's body was found stabbed , with her throat slit , in her apartment in the @entity23 in july 2008			1
the court 's latest decision came after a review of the sentence by @entity2 's grand mufti , the country 's highest religious official			2
because the two men were sentenced under @entity33 law , it is widely expected they will be hanged			0
the court usually seeks to get the @entity39 's " advice only on any death sentence , according to the law , " a legal source in @entity35 told @entity0			0
" however , the @entity39 's advice to the court is not binding at all , " added the source , who asked not to be named			0
" even if the @entity39 was against the death sentence , that will not have any effect on the judge 's decision , who will have the final say , " the source said			0
since his 2003 appointment as grand mufti , sheikh @entity50 has received about 480 cases from the court that included death sentences			0
he supported the judge 's decision in 478 and opposed twice , but the rule was implemented according to the court conviction			0
@entity8 's lawyer previously told reporters that he would appeal the conviction , saying there was " a 1 million percent guarantee " the sentence would be overturned			2
prosecutors alleged @entity8 , a parliament member for the ruling @entity65 , paid @entity18 $ 2 million to kill @entity20			1
during the trial , @entity8 's lawyer told @entity0 his client loved the singer but could not take @entity20 as a second wife because his family objected			1
polygamy is legal in @entity2 , and it 's not unusual for men such as @entity8 , a married father of three , to take on additional wives			2
prosecutors have said @entity20 's death was a " means of taking revenge " but have not elaborated			1
@entity8 and @entity18 claim the prosecution 's evidence could have been fabricated or tampered with by @entity23 authorities and should not be used against them			1
although @entity20 was killed in the @entity23 , the @entity2 judiciary tried the case in @entity35 because the accused were arrested in @entity2			2
after @entity8 's arrest in september , @entity2 authorities indicted him , stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial			2
he also resigned as chairman of @entity89 -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father , @entity89			0
@entity8 's brother , @entity94 , now chairs the company			0
