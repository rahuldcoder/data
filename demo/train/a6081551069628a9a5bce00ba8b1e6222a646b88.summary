one week after @entity0 scored massive electoral victories in the @entity2 and @entity3 , the 58 wide - eyed and triumphant @entity2 lawmakers - to - be descended upon @entity5 -- a city many of them campaigned against -- for a crash course on how to be a member of @entity9			1
the dizzying pace of the seven - day congressional freshman orientation has trappings of the first day of college : there 's apartment hunting , a picture day , field trips , an " office fair , " assemblies , briefings on how to stay out of trouble , an id card check - in , welcome meetings with leadership and hugs and kisses from loved ones			2
some of the members of the new class entered the @entity30 for the first time wednesday night , a structure obscured by rows of grey scaffolding as part of a massive years - long refurbishment project			2
for the next several days , many will spend time lost in the building 's underground labyrinth of poorly - marked hallways			1
the men and women of the 114th @entity9 come from diverse backgrounds : there 's one car salesman , a dentist , a forester , a 9 - 1 - 1 dispatcher , a former @entity50 officer , two @entity52 preachers , an economics professor , an electrician , an arms dealer and , as is tradition , a small army of attorneys			1
amid the pageantry and high - minded lectures about the value of " public service , " the incoming lawmakers will spend much of their time dealing with the mundane , such as securing access to new government computers and telephones			1
they 'll be tasked with ensuring their new offices have copiers and fax machines			1
according to a copy of the orientation schedule acquired by @entity74 , members are encouraged to visit the " new member @entity75 " where they can get help setting up their new website or choose a carpet - and - wall color scheme for their new office digs			2
in the basement of the @entity84 , @entity82 techies will be on hand to demonstrate " the newest computer and telecommunications equipment			1
" meanwhile , the @entity2 portrait studio will provide official congressional photos — the cost will be billed to their " @entity91 " — and delivered on compact disk			2
on wednesday night , the members - elect began a dizzying schedule of briefings , starting with a " sneak peek into @entity97 , @entity98 and being a freshman " for the @entity0 group on wednesday night and a bi-partisan reception			2
after that , both parties retreated to their proper corners : @entity105 joined @entity106 for a dinner in @entity108 while @entity0 attended a forum down the hall			2
on thursday morning , the newbies departed their security - heavy hotel on a brisk walk to the @entity30 for a four - hour briefing on exciting subjects such as how to properly use their office budget to buy pens			0
the friday schedule calls for an hour - long bipartisan breakfast panel entitled " @entity125 " hosted by longstanding members with wisdom to share , followed by tours of the @entity30 's hallowed halls			0
freshman orientation comes with saturday school , where the members - elect will get a whirlwind tour of the " legislative process , " a subject many seem to struggle to retain			0
the next week begins with a class photo on the @entity30 steps followed by the most important meeting yet : ethics training			0
after they 're scared straight at the ethics briefing , it will be time for an inspirational field trip — for @entity0 only			0
the new @entity0 class will hop on a bus to the @entity141 with @entity2 majority leader @entity142 , a @entity143 @entity0 , for a " private document viewing " of the @entity145 and the @entity146			0
the orientation marathon concludes next wednesday with a lottery to determine who gets the first crack at office space			0
a race for the high - rise penthouse this is not : the best real estate on @entity82 is actually on the lower floors , which shortens travel between to the @entity2 floor for votes			1
those unlucky souls assigned to the far corners of @entity9 ' little empire are reminded that yes , it gets @entity163			1
" @entity169 was on the fifth floor , " @entity165 @entity164 rep. @entity164 , the chairwoman of the @entity166 reminded the freshman on their first day			0
" we all start there			0
" in the meantime , the members - elect will also have a chance to subscribe to their favorite political magazines and newspapers , free of charge			0
fun fact : since 1983 , all congressional offices automatically receive free deliveries of pornography , courtesy of a monthly shipment of @entity187 's @entity186			0
once it 's all over , this gang of bewildered and bleary - eyed future lawmakers of @entity190 will say goodbye to their new friends and return home for the holidays			1
they 'll be back in january , when the real fun starts .			1

new lawmakers are on @entity82
they 'll spend several days learning about @entity9
