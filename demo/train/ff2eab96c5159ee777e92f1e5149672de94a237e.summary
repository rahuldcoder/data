like millions of @entity2 this winter , my toddler has the flu			2
the good news is that , unlike most of our nation 's restaurant workers , my baby does n't have to go to work sick			1
the @entity9 is reporting widespread flu in 47 states			0
during the 2009 swine flu outbreak , the @entity13 administration told people to stay home when they were sick			2
that 's why it 's important we understand that , according to research conducted by my organization , @entity17 , almost 90 % of restaurant workers say they do not have access to paid sick leave			1
plus , given that the federal minimum wage for tipped workers has been stuck at just $ 2.13 an hour since 1991 , two - thirds of our nation 's cooks and servers and bussers report they can not afford to stay home when they 're sick , because they wo n't get paid and might even lose their jobs			1
a 2011 study by the @entity9 found that 12 % of almost 500 food service workers surveyed had experienced vomiting and diarrhea on two or more shifts in the previous year			0
what 's more disgusting than that ? that restaurant owners essentially force employees to come to work sick because they do n't have paid sick days			1
this month , 1.2 million people in @entity48 suffered from norovirus , also known as the " winter vomiting bug			0
" @entity51 is commonly contracted through contaminated food			0
in 2009 , a bartender with swine flu worked for several days at a @entity56 hot spot because , he told me , he could n't afford to not go to work			0
if we do n't pay food industry workers decent wages and ensure they receive paid sick days , then no matter how much the @entity64 regulates the boiling temperature for processing cheese , restaurant workers will keep sneezing on our dinner and food - borne contamination and illness will continue to be a problem			1
the health of our nation 's 10 million food service workers is intimately tied to the health of millions of @entity2 who routinely eat food prepared by someone else			0
one in six @entity2 gets sick from a food - borne illness every year , and when those instances can be traced to a single cause , in more than half of cases it 's a restaurant			2
specifically , research shows that somewhere between 48 % to 93 % of all food - borne norovirus outbreaks may be tracked back to sick food service workers			2
the federal @entity86 , expected to be re-introduced this year , would require all businesses with 15 or more employees to provide up to seven days of paid sick leave each year			1
@entity90 , @entity91 , the @entity56 and the state of @entity93 have already approved such legislation locally			0
if we pay restaurant workers a living wage and ensure they can stay home when they 're sick , that means fewer taxpayer dollars on public health emergencies and fewer stomach aches for diners as well			1
when we get the flu , we just want to stay in bed and have someone care for us			0
we should allow restaurant workers the ability to do that , too			1
@entity2 would be a healthier place for it .			0

@entity114 : restaurant workers , who *rarely* have paid sick leave , can spread flu
she says minimum wage for tipped workers is $ *2.13/hour* ; to earn living , they must come in
@entity114 : @entity125 should pass @entity86 , which would legislate sick leave
