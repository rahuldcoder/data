after the massacre in @entity2 , @entity3 , people everywhere are demanding common sense reforms to our gun laws			2
according to a january poll , for example , an overwhelming 92 % of @entity7 back background checks for every gun sale			1
we all need to take action to see real change			2
president @entity14 has unveiled a bold package of legislation , and our leaders in @entity18 are finally listening			1
we are encouraged by this , but concerned @entity7 must stand united against gun violence and put pressure on elected leaders to vote accordingly for real solutions			1
like the president said during the @entity25 , this issue deserves a vote -- our elected officials are accountable to the survivors of gun violence and the families of victims , and they deserve a vote			1
now more than ever , we need to provide support for the advocacy organizations that are working to establish a formidable counterweight to the gun lobby , which is well financed , well organized and will stop at nothing to protect the interests of the firearms industry and obstruct sensible legislation that will help save lives			1
groups like the @entity43 for a @entity44 and @entity45 -- spearheaded by @entity47 mayor @entity46 -- have been leading the charge in @entity18 for meaningful reform			1
it is incumbent upon all of us in the philanthropic community and the people served by these programs to stand firmly behind them during this critical time			2
we have been proud to join other foundations and grant makers in backing these organizations			2
with the help of our resources , they have conducted essential policy research , raised public awareness and launched national campaigns that have brought us closer than ever to stopping the bloodshed			0
but there 's still so much more that philanthropists can do to further this cause			0
@entity68 , after all , is activism			0
it is not merely writing checks and throwing money at problems ; it is investing in solutions that can lead to momentous change			2
we have an obligation to help save lives			0
this is n't about politics			0
this is about reclaiming our fundamental right to safety			0
what better investment could there be ? over the years , we have each financed major public institutions in @entity86 and across the @entity7 -- from opera houses to charter schools , scientific research centers to art museums			1
they have all contributed to positive change in our community and our country			0
but what good are they if our children are n't safe in their classrooms ? what good are they if a 15 - year - old girl can perform at the president 's inaugural festivities one week and be gunned down in a @entity103 park the next ? we need to take a comprehensive approach to reducing gun violence , and the time is now to do it			1
supporting nonprofit advocacy groups will help maintain the energy behind reform and keep pressure on our elected officials			1
political leaders can no longer duck this issue or the growing grass - roots movement that it has inspired			0
the philanthropic community can help ensure our elected representatives make the right decisions			0
private citizens can help make a difference in whatever way they are able -- writing a check , donating in - kind contributions , calling or writing their elected representatives , volunteering time to a nonprofit .			0
