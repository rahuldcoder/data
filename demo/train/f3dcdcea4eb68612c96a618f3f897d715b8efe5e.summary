-- @entity1 can sum up his turbulent year in two words : " existential crisis			1
" that 's how the 28 - year - old actor , who 'll next star alongside @entity8 in october 17 's " @entity9 , " described his recent behavior on @entity12 ' talk show friday			1
@entity12 , always the gracious host , kindly asked @entity1 to explain just what 's been going on with him since the start of 2014			1
he 's gone from skywriting an apology for plagiarism to wearing a bag over his head to being arrested for an outburst during a @entity22 production			2
" i went through like an existential crisis , which turned into an exploration , really , " @entity1 told @entity12			1
" i had some hiccups , some judgment error			1
" so when he hosted a performance art installation called " @entity29 " earlier this year , the actor said that was a genuine attempt to apologize to the public			0
" there was a lot of negativity online , so i thought , alright , let 's see what this negativity is about			0
let 's invite it in , " @entity1 said			1
" i was really , truly apologetic ... i was sort of apologizing to the public in a way			0
i thought for sure people were going to come in there and be super mean , but it was n't that way at all			0
once they got in there everything changed , they stopped looking at me like an object they started looking at me like a human			0
" that loving experience did n't automatically put @entity1 back on the right path			1
in june , he was charged with disorderly conduct , harassment and criminal trespass after being accused of drunken and disruptive behavior in a @entity22 venue			0
( the charges were later settled with the agreement being that @entity1 would continue seeking treatment for alcohol addiction			1
) the time he spent in jail for that incident was enough to get him to rethink his actions			2
it was n't the first time he 'd been in lockup , but it was " the worst time , " probably because he did spit on a cop , as he told @entity12			1
" @entity75 is quite scary			0
i was there for what felt like forever -- 24 hours or 25 hours			0
... it was really rough , " he said			0
not to mention the actor also got a good earful from his mother , whom he 's very close to			2
when he 's not behaving as well as he could , he 'll get a phone call in which he 'll bluntly be told , " stop f * * * * * g around			0
" may be brusque , but it works : " now i 'm on the right path , " @entity1 said			2
@entity8 , @entity1 nearly fought with @entity86			2

@entity1 opened up about his past on " @entity12 "
he explained some of his recent behavior as an " existential crisis "
the actor said he 's had " some hiccups , " and " some judgment error "
both his mom and a little jail time helped *straighten* him up
