-- the mixed reaction to the conviction of a @entity7 college student of a hate crime , after he spied on his gay roommate while he was having sex , has revealed an interesting generational split in the gay community			1
many people my age , who grew up in the ' 50s and the ' 60s , when nearly everyone felt they had to be in the closet , seem to be sympathetic to the idea that a conviction that will discourage the kind of behavior @entity20 engaged in is a good thing			1
the fact that his roommate committed suicide the day after the spying occurred , by throwing himself off the @entity23 , certainly contributed to the climate that made many people satisfied by @entity32 's conviction			1
but quite a few younger gays -- 20 - somethings -- seem more interested in a nuanced interpretation of @entity32 's behavior , and much more concerned that he faces the possibility of a 10 - year prison sentence			1
it 's partly their closeness to the age of the defendant that makes them empathetic to the perpetrator of an offensive prank , which may have sparked a catastrophic outcome			2
but this is also a generation of gay people who grew up recognizing three distinct groups among their straight peers : supporters , neutrals and committed homophobes			0
and despite the jury 's verdict , they remain unconvinced that @entity32 belongs in that third category			2
they are also more skeptical about the connection between @entity32 's spying and the subsequent suicide of @entity61			2
" we do n't really know why @entity64 jumped from that bridge , " is a typical assessment			0
after his conviction , @entity32 told the @entity67 , " i wo n't ever get up there and tell the world i hated @entity70 because he was gay , or tell the world i was trying to hurt or intimidate him , because it 's not true			1
" many younger gay men believe him : they say the seemingly anti-gay messages @entity32 sent to his friends fall far short of proving the kind of hatred they think is worthy of a hate crime conviction			1
" i 've seen so much worse , " @entity80 told @entity81 for a piece about the case in @entity84			0
" the stuff that @entity61 says is understandable , in a sense			0
if you find you 're sharing a room with somebody gay , and you have n't been raised in an open home , you 're going to say , ' @entity91 , what am i going to do ? ' " writing in @entity95 , 24 - year - old gay editor and columnist @entity93 said that while he certainly was not " excusing @entity32 for his actions , " he believes that " these civil rights statutes are being stretched to go after teenagers who acted meanly , but not violently			1
this is n't what civil rights laws should be for			0
... we live in a world that validates adult bullies all the time			0
" it was also @entity93 who said the precise reason for the boy 's suicide is ultimately unknowable			2
" based on the evidence that we do have , the image of @entity32 as a malicious homophobe getting his just deserts looks dubious at best			0
" the complex point of view of this younger generation demonstrates how far we have come from the black and white world of the 1950s , when anti-gay prejudice was so commonplace that even the @entity119 refused to oppose an executive order in 1953 when the federal government banned gay employees in all of its agencies and all of their contractors			0
a new generation of gay people believe that @entity32 is far from being an outright bigot			0
they see his acts as immature and unfortunate , but they reject the view of the @entity7 jurors who decided he should be punished for hate			1
@entity32 refused a plea bargain that could have spared him a prison term , but would have required him to plead guilty to a crime that he believes he did not commit			1
the usual practice in criminal courts across @entity139 is to punish someone with a harsh prison sentence when he is convicted by a jury after he has declined such a bargain			1
but my younger friends have convinced me that @entity32 deserves a more nuanced punishment			0
since @entity32 insists he is without prejudice , he should be sentenced to speak at a different high school every week for a year			1
the nightmare he has already experienced makes him the perfect person to share a vital lesson : you do n't have to hate gay people in your heart to cause misery to others			0
just the perception that you are anti-gay can sometimes have disastrous consequences			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity7 college student faces 10 - year prison sentence on hate crime conviction
@entity160 says some younger gays are questioning the *wisdom* of a harsh sentence
he says there 's some doubt whether @entity20 is really guilty of a hate crime
*kaiser* : a better sentence would be for him to tell high school students what he 's learned
