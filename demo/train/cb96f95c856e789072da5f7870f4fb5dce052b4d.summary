-- arriving at an air terminal is rarely a memorable event			0
all the more reason to book a flight touching down at one of these hairy or awesome air strips			0
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 vacationers flock to the @entity9 for a laid - back vacation			1
but arriving at the region 's airports can have the opposite effect -- the compact , rugged nature of many of the islands forces runways to be built in inventive locations			2
perhaps everything feels all the more serene after landing			2
on @entity8 , @entity7 -- named after @entity22 royalty -- has people gnawing their fingernails in the air and on the ground whenever a plane lands			1
the runway starts mere meters from the edge of the ocean , with aircraft coming in almost low enough over the beach to spike a volleyball set			1
more : breathtaking photos of @entity38 's @entity37 's glory days @entity39 , @entity40 unlike @entity9 - bound passengers , skiers and snowboarders touching down at @entity39 are usually geared up for an adrenaline fix			2
in winter , the tarmac air strip at the @entity40 resort 's altiport , more than 2,000 meters above sea level , is often the only thing not covered in snow			1
aircraft fly in through a channel between mountains , landing on a short , steeply sloping runway , complete with vertical drop off , that could almost double as a ski jump			1
the scene is so dramatic it was featured as a stunt location in the @entity61 movie " @entity62			1
" ( editor 's note : we initially referred to an incorrect @entity61 film " @entity67			1
" ) @entity68 , @entity69 there 's little chance of extending this runway very far -- it ends abruptly at the edge of a 600 - meter drop			1
only light aircraft use the airstrip on this remote tabletop plateau in the tiny southern @entity79 kingdom			0
planes sometimes fail to ascend at the end of the runway , conjuring images of a @entity84 hover and fall ( before , thankfully , achieving flying speed and soaring away )			1
more on @entity0 : best in airport food and drink @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity9 rivaling @entity8 for @entity9 airport thrills , @entity88 , on the island of @entity89 , has one of the world 's shortest landing strips			1
wedged on a rocky outcrop at the foot of a mountain and with the end of the tarmac plunging into the sea , touchdown here is a dramatic experience			2
@entity103 flying toward a gigantic limestone monolith on a landing approach is never easy on the nerves , but in the 6.2 - square - kilometer @entity109 overseas territory of @entity103 there 's nowhere else to put an airport except in the shadow of the @entity112			1
space is so limited on the southern tip of the @entity115 that the runway bisects the territory 's main highway			1
as aircraft get priority over automobiles in the vehicular pecking order , the road is closed every time a plane takes off or arrives			0
@entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 where else in the world can you pick cockles on a runway ? rather than think about where to build a tarmac airstrip when you 're short on space , the @entity126 island of @entity125 took a different approach -- it did n't bother with one			0
pilots wait until the tide is out and then land on the beach -- reportedly the only airport in the world where scheduled flights touch down on sand			0
in between flights to and from @entity148 , the public have open access to the beach / runway			2
@entity152 , @entity153 if there were awards for remote airways surrounded by dramatic scenery , the @entity154 would be filling a shelf			0
in pride of place might stand the only international airport in the mountainous kingdom of @entity153 descending into a narrow , high - altitude bowl amid 6,000 - meter peaks , pilots -- who have to be specially trained to land here -- bank their jets in a sharp right turn before swooping in low over farm houses			0
more on @entity0 : @entity172 's busiest airport @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 landing on an aircraft carrier looks thrilling , but you usually have to join the armed services to do it			2
you can experience a good second best at @entity175 's @entity173 , where the two runways appear to float on the water way out in @entity184			0
actually located on a purpose - built artificial island , to minimize noise pollution for city residents , the runways are in fact sizeable affairs ( both more than three kilometers long ) and connected to the mainland by a four - kilometer bridge			0
but from the air , this is the best way to get that " @entity197 " feeling on a commercial carrier			0
@entity198 / @entity199 , @entity200 on the approach to @entity203 in the region of @entity205 , planes skirt through fjord - land , over frozen lakes and between snow - covered mountains			0
arriving at the settlement of @entity213 , in the country 's extreme northeast , feels like touching down on an ice rink at certain times of the year			0
@entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 @entity220 's international airport looks as if it 's been cheating in a tricky - runway competition			2
sandwiched between a steep hillside and the sea , its dramatically short tarmac strip is extended on stilts over the water to make it long enough for a safe touchdown			0
throw in frequent @entity229 turbulence and you 've got an arrival dramatic enough to make the calmest passenger reach for the fortified wine			0
@entity234 , @entity235 @entity234 has looks and drama			1
built on its very own atoll , @entity240 , the runway is a mere six feet feet above sea level			1
after descending over the 26 - island @entity235 archipelago , undercarriages feel so close to the sea on touchdown it 's as if they 're skimming along the water			1
ever landed at one of these airports ? know of one that should be on our list ? leave a comment below .			0

planes landing on @entity8 fly so low they risk *intercepting* volleyballs on the beach
@entity261 's runway was featured in a @entity61 film
@entity234 , in the @entity235 , is only six feet above sea level
@entity266 suddenly seems so much less *exciting*
