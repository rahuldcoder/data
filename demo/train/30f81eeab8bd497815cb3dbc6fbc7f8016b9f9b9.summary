-- the defeat of @entity3 president @entity2 at the hands of @entity5 has the potential to greatly affect @entity8 politics and the future of the euro , as many have noted			1
but the election of the first @entity3 @entity14 president since 1995 also could dramatically change @entity3 's role in the world , at a particularly sensitive time			1
no doubt both sides of the @entity18 will keep a close eye on the rhetoric and actions of the new @entity3 leader in the days ahead			2
almost from the outset , @entity5 will be in the international spotlight , with the g - 8 meeting at @entity26 , @entity27 , and the @entity28 in @entity29 less than two weeks away , and a @entity31 meeting scheduled for june in @entity32			2
the @entity28 alliance faces a complex transition in @entity35			2
the international community is dealing with an increasingly untenable situation in @entity38 and may soon have to contemplate military action			2
and while the nuclear crisis with @entity42 is at an ebb , it is by no means over			0
there are already strong signals that a @entity5 administration will bring more change than continuity			0
@entity2 , while not a @entity50 , sought to restore @entity3 national pride based on @entity3 's role as a leader in the international community			1
his efforts were most notable in his participation in the @entity28 operations in @entity58			0
@entity5 will inherit record debt of just over $ 2 trillion and a jobless rate hovering around 10 %			0
it is unclear what price the @entity3 defense establishment will have to pay to meet the president - elect 's desire to balance the budget by 2017 , but with the @entity68 in the midst of an internal review , @entity3 military policy will likely see changes driven by @entity5 and his team			1
@entity5 's advisers have stated that the new leader is likely to announce an accelerated timetable for @entity3 withdrawal from @entity35 that could bring all @entity3 troops home by the end of this year			1
while the operational impact of the early removal of all 3,300 @entity3 troops could be addressed with some effort , there may be greater political fallout from the @entity3 rejection of the principle of " in together , out together , " especially given the lack of public support for the @entity35 mission throughout @entity8			1
the president - elect 's advisers have also claimed the new leader has reservations about @entity2 's support of increased participation in @entity28 , specifically the @entity3 decision to rejoin @entity28 's military command structure			1
@entity97 , a key adviser to @entity5 and a potential defense minister , is reported to have said that @entity5 would demand a greater decision - making role for @entity3 within @entity28			1
but @entity3 can not , of course , have its cake and eat it too			0
@entity3 participation in both @entity35 and @entity58 has been significant -- but equivocation regarding @entity28 commitments will make requests for increased authority ring hollow to other alliance members			1
rather , if @entity3 is to have a greater say , then @entity5 must be willing to put alliance interests ahead of national interests from time to time			1
still , @entity5 has also intimated that he could take a more pragmatic approach and understands that @entity3 actions could have practical and symbolic impacts that might detract from @entity3 standing in the world			2
he is a career politician and no doubt understands the downside of placing @entity3 at odds with its allies unnecessarily at a time when concerted action by the trans - @entity18 powers on economic and security issues could not be more important			0
indeed , president - elect @entity5 's advisers say his no. 1 foreign policy priority will be helping to revive @entity8 's economy			1
no doubt , the economy will be the driving issue during the @entity129 general election , and political pundits will be considering whether the @entity2 defeat holds lessons for voters who will go to the polls this autumn			0
just as in @entity3 , there is no shortage of voter anger with incumbents , and the low approval rating for @entity141 suggests we may see new faces on @entity144 in january			0
likewise , the @entity129 faces important policy challenges on health care , immigration , and of course taxation and spending			0
but beyond that , the dynamics of @entity3 and @entity129 politics part ways			0
indeed , for the @entity129 it will largely be the @entity5 policy agenda that matters more -- not the political circumstances under which he gained office			2
in a world rife with instability and faced with a fragile economic recovery , there will remain an imperative for effective alliances , forward - looking foreign policy , and strong and internationally respected leadership			0
@entity5 may wish to be a leader singularly focused on @entity3 and @entity8 economic needs , but success in these matters may rest on his initial ability not only to find a balance between politics and policy , but to demonstrate that he can work effectively with his fellow world leaders			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

@entity177 : election of @entity5 has global implications
he says new @entity3 president could accelerate withdrawal of @entity3 troops from @entity35
@entity175 : @entity3 , which played leading role in @entity58 , could affect @entity38 and @entity42 policy
@entity5 's success may rest on his ability to work with leaders of other nations , he says
