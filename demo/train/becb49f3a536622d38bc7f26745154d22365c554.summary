@entity0 , @entity1 -- the hot - button issue of illegal immigration erupted in the @entity1 race for governor wednesday as a @entity8 housekeeper once employed by @entity10 nominee @entity9 alleged that she had been " exploited , disrespected , humiliated and emotionally and financially abused " by the former @entity12 ceo			1
@entity14 , who worked for @entity9 for nine years , was fired in june 2009 " for what appeared to be political reasons involving ms. @entity9 's decision to run for governor , " famed attorney @entity13 claimed in a news conference			1
the @entity9 campaign immediately shot back , providing immigration and @entity23 forms it said @entity14 signed stating she was a legal resident of the @entity25 when she first applied for employment as a housekeeper in 2000			1
the campaign included a copy of a social security card and @entity1 driver 's license it said @entity14 had given @entity9			1
@entity9 , in an interview wednesday afternoon , said she relied on the employment agency that provided @entity14 to verify she was a legal resident			1
" as soon as we found that she was an illegal immigrant , we did what we had to do as an employer , which was to let her go , " @entity9 said			2
" but all of the documentation that we had said that she was legal			0
" @entity13 alleged that @entity9 should have known @entity14 was an undocumented worker , because several letters , dating back to 2002 , were sent to her about the maid 's " mismatched " @entity43 number			1
a copy of that letter will be released to the news media thursday , @entity13 said			2
" @entity14 also alleges that for several more years , ms. @entity9 continued to receive the letters from the @entity48 regarding the mismatch in the @entity43 numbers , " @entity13 said			1
" she also alleges that she saw these letters after they were thrown into the trash			0
" @entity13 claimed that back in august 2000 , @entity14 " was sent by an employment agency to interview with @entity9 for a job as a housekeeper			1
... @entity14 alleges that ms. @entity9 never asked if [ she ] was here legally , " @entity13 said			2
" the inconvenient truth of the hypocrisy of @entity9 as illustrated by her employment of an undocumented worker and her exploitation of her was going to be revealed , because @entity14 wanted to be legalized , " @entity13 said			1
" @entity14 was terminated in a sudden , cruel and heartless way , " she added			0
@entity13 said @entity14 intends to file a claim for unfairly denied wages			0
" when i met with @entity9 on june 20 , 2009 , i asked her for assistance , " @entity14 said			2
" i explained to her why i came to the @entity25			0
i explained that i was married and our economic situation in @entity8 was very bad			2
we had no job , no food , no place to live and for that reason we made the decision to come here			0
" " ms. @entity9 just laughed , " @entity14 said			2
@entity9 , @entity14 claimed , also blamed herself for failing to previously ask for any documentation			2
@entity9 , according to @entity14 , indicated four days later that she could n't help the former housekeeper			1
" she said , ' i can not help you and do not say anything to my children			0
i will tell them you already have a new job and that you want to go to school and from now on , you do n't know me and i do not know you			0
you have never seen me and i have never seen you			0
do you understand me ? ' " @entity13 also outlined what she said were abusive labor practices by @entity9 , including not reimbursing the maid for mileage when she ran errands and not allowing her maternity leave			2
" when @entity14 indicated to ms. @entity9 in march 2005 , that she needed to take a medical leave of absence for pregnancy , she alleges that she was told that unless she herself obtained someone to replace her , that her job might not be there for her when she returned			2
" @entity9 has previously beat back allegations she was involved in a 2007 shoving altercation with an employee at @entity12 's @entity1 headquarters after the @entity97 chief felt unprepared for an upcoming media interview			1
the incident reportedly led to a $ 200,000 settlement			0
responding to the press conference , @entity9 campaign laywer @entity101 told reporters that , when hired in 2000 , @entity14 gave @entity9 false documentation , including @entity23 forms , a social security card , a @entity1 drivers license , and @entity110 immigration forms in which the stated she was a lawful alien			1
when @entity14 told @entity9 in 2009 that the documents were false and she was illegal , @entity9 " immediately suspended and then terminated " @entity14 's employment , according to the campaign			1
@entity115 , a senior advisor to the campaign , told reporters that @entity9 " is very sad and has deep sorrow " over the incident			1
" she was , in many ways , a member of our extended family and i feel badly for her , " @entity9 said			2
" she 's being manipulated			0
" @entity9 spokeswoman @entity123 ripped @entity13 , claiming the high - profile attorney is merely attempting to smear the @entity1 @entity10			1
" with the polls tied , it comes as no surprise that the morning after a successful debate for @entity9 that the sleaze machine of the political left is now focused on the politics of personal destruction			0
@entity13 is a shameful manipulator and the timing of today 's news conference so close to the election should serve as a warning to @entity1 that they are witnessing dirty political smears at their worst , " @entity133 said in a statement			0
@entity115 said it was " curious " that @entity14 would bring forward allegations against @entity9 a mere 35 days before the election			0
it 's even " more curious , " he said , that the news conference featuring the former housekeeper was being orchestrated by @entity13 , who has a " clear relationship " with @entity149 gubernatorial nominee @entity148			0
a @entity2 check of @entity13 's political contributions showed she has donated extensively to @entity149 candidates			0
the allegations are part of a " post-debate smoke bomb " to try and obscure @entity148 's " bizarre behavior " after tuesday night 's debate against @entity9 , @entity115 claimed			1
it is part of the politics of " personal destruction , " he said			0
with a sardonic laugh , @entity115 asked reporters , " what 's a @entity1 governors race without @entity13 inserting herself into it ? " @entity9 is currently neck and neck with @entity148 in the polls			1
the issue of immigration looms large in @entity1 , as in other states along the @entity8 border			0
@entity9 has come out against @entity174 's controversial new anti-illegal immigration law , as well as @entity1 's controversial @entity175			1
however , she supports tough crackdowns on employers who hire illegal immigrants , requiring employers " pay a fine and have their business license suspended for 10 days " for first - time offenses , with steeper fines and penalties for repeat offenders .			0
