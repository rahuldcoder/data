-- @entity4 gov. @entity3 vetoed legislation that would have allowed concealed pistol license holders who undergo additional training to carry concealed pistols in schools and other public places , his office said tuesday in a statement			1
@entity3 rejected the bill because it did not provide an opportunity for public places -- such as schools , day care centers and hospitals -- to exempt themselves from the provision , the statement said			1
at present , @entity4 law does not prevent holders of concealed pistol licenses from carrying guns in these areas as long as they do so openly			0
@entity3 recommended that the bill be modified so that it would not permit the open carrying of weapons in these public areas , but would permit concealed carry for license holders who undergo additional training , his statement said			1
but even with this modification , he would still want property owners to be able to decide whether to allow concealed weapons on their premises , he said			0
analysis : guns and the law " these public venues need clear legal authority to ban firearms on their premises if they see fit to do so , " he said			2
also tuesday , @entity3 signed two bills that streamline the process for handgun purchases and eliminate restrictions on interstate rifle and shotgun transactions			1
the bill was approved thursday by the @entity54 - controlled @entity53 and @entity55			2
in a news release , @entity3 's office said the governor " had committed to give the bill additional scrutiny " prior to friday 's school shootings in @entity62 " in an effort to ensure that public safety remains a priority			1
" but speaker @entity66 , @entity67 , said in a statement that the bill " would have had no impact on that tragedy " in @entity62			1
he said it was " unfortunate a compromise was not reached " and added , " it also is unfortunate that this veto does not make @entity4 citizens safer in gun - free zones			0
neither the governor 's approval nor his veto will stop evil from preying on innocent people			0
" with this veto , however , open - carry still exists in schools , churches and other public areas , and we know that criminals do not respect gun - free zones			2
for these reasons , we will continue to work with the governor to best protect our law - abiding citizens ' @entity91 rights , as well as the safety and security of all of our citizens			0
" at present , 21 states ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus , according to the @entity99 ; 23 states leave the decision to ban or allow concealed weapons on campuses to individual colleges and universities			0
opinions : teachers with guns is a crazy idea			0

the state legislature passed the bill on thursday
@entity3 says he had *planned* to give the bill " additional scrutiny " prior to @entity62 shootings
the bill did not provide an opportunity for public places to exempt themselves
