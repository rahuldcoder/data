-- the recent ruling of a federal appeals court requiring the family of fallen hero @entity5 @entity4 to pay the legal expenses of @entity7 and his misguided followers at @entity9 is unconscionable			1
like @entity4 's father , @entity11 , i am all too familiar with the hardships associated with losing a son in combat , having lost my son @entity15 in 2004			2
it is a tragedy that the thanks given the @entity4 family in return for the life of their son is a court order to repay the legal expenses of the hate group that protested at his funeral with signs such as " thank @entity29 for dead soldiers			1
" beyond simply insulting though , this decision by the 4th @entity32 is a slap in the face for every @entity35 family that has lost a loved one in combat			0
it also represents an egregious misuse of the judicial system ; one that sets a dangerous precedent for how the memory of our fallen heroes will be treated			0
the @entity46 should immediately move forward with this case and stand up for those who have stood in the face of danger for all @entity51			2
the legal maneuvers that brought @entity53 and his family to this point are enough to make any @entity51 shake his or her head in disgust			2
after @entity4 lost his life in 2006 , @entity7 and his followers showed up at his funeral to spread their message of hate			0
mind you , they did n't know @entity4 , and thus had no understanding of the enormous sense of loss his family was feeling ; they simply decided that the @entity4 family 's vulnerability presented an easy platform for their own agenda			0
to his credit , @entity53 sued the group and won an $ 11 million judgment against them			0
however , that award was reduced to $ 5 million on one appeal and overturned altogether this week by the appeals court			0
in fact , not only did the court overturn the original ruling , but it decided to add to the pain and suffering of the @entity4 family by imposing more than $ 16,000 of court fees			1
perhaps the judges had forgotten that without the sacrifices of brave soldiers and their families , the @entity51 judicial system would have been a long - distant memory			1
beyond the inherent injustice of the court 's decision is the message it sends to the thousands of families around the country that have received a tightly wrapped flag and heard the words , " on behalf of a grateful nation ... " when the @entity4 family sued to protect the common decency we should provide to all grieving families , their efforts were met with court orders to pay the legal bills of those who caused their family so much needless pain			1
surely , this is not the kind of thing that @entity118 or my son , @entity15 , gave their lives to protect			2
has our nation learned nothing from our treatment of returning @entity127 veterans ? what would have been the reaction to @entity7 and his repugnant actions during @entity131 ? our veterans and the families of those who did n't return deserve better than this			2
looking ahead , as engagements in @entity137 draw on and our soldiers answer the call to defend freedom around the world , this case could have a dangerous effect on morale and willingness to serve			0
it is time for the @entity46 to take up this case , not only for families like @entity53 but for the families who will bear the ultimate price of freedom in the future			1
the justices should strike down the ruling of the @entity154 court that brushed aside the sacrifice of @entity118 and restore common sense and basic decency to the way we honor our fallen heroes			1
@entity4 fought on behalf of all of us , and now his father fights on his behalf			0
i can only hope that the @entity46 will restore some measure of justice and dignity to a family so richly deserving of the best the @entity169 has to offer			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

father of a dead @entity175 was ordered to pay court costs to protesters who *picketed* funeral
@entity172 , whose son also died in the @entity175 , says ruling was unconscionable
he says soldiers and families make great sacrifices to protect the nation
@entity172 urges the @entity169 @entity46 to restore justice and dignity to the family
