-- feted by @entity3 and applauded by @entity4 at @entity5 , @entity2 filmmaker @entity1 appears to finally live up to his name			1
facing the press in @entity5 , @entity1 went on to pick up the best director prize			1
despite only directing for four years , @entity1 won the award for best director at the @entity11 earlier this year for " @entity12 " , beating off competition from filmmaking royalty including @entity4 himself			1
after picking up the award , @entity4 wrote to @entity1 congratulating him on his award and saying his film was " bold , daring and ... the whole point of making movies in the first place			1
" making movies is something that the 49 - year - old from @entity25 in the @entity2 is relatively new to			2
he spent 20 years as a production designer before directing his first film in 2005 , but since then he has n't looked back and in just over four years has made another seven films			1
his style of social realism has attracted as much critical acclaim as it has baffled and alienated audiences			0
but if an artist 's anathema is indifference , @entity1 has more than succeeded in avoiding that curse			2
featuring explicit sex , his films have been faced with heavy censorship in his native @entity2 , and while @entity3 and the other judges at @entity5 loved his film " @entity44 , " it proved to be one of the most divisive ; " @entity47 " magazine called it exploitative and veteran film critic @entity49 said it was the worst film at the festival			1
" i believe that my films will find their audience , probably not now but maybe in the future ... i 'm doing my job , by presenting some stories that normally a mainstream director or mainstream filmmaker wo n't tackle , wo n't show , " he told @entity0			2
" @entity44 " was only the third ever film from the @entity2 to be shown in @entity5 , and while elevating @entity1 to a new level of attention , the man himself hopes it will give the whole country a higher profile			1
" because now they will look at @entity2 films in a different way , unlike before they only see ... films from the @entity2 like melodrama , about prostitution , about poverty , " he said			2
citing @entity77 neo-realist filmmakers like @entity78 as inspirational figures , @entity1 has crafted his own style of @entity2 realism on the screen			1
he shoots without additional lighting and often only gives actors an outline of the scene they will be filming , letting them improvise around their characters			0
" i do n't want to limit them , i just want to give them the freedom			0
i do n't even show my actors the script			0
i mean i just tell them you know the lines they 're going to say in that day			0
so they do n't know exactly what will happen , " he told @entity0			0
using raw filming techniques , @entity1 hopes to expose the naked truth of life in the @entity2 , but he 's also aware that when directing , he reveals much about himself			1
" as a filmmaker you ca n't help giving something about yourself in your film			2
a friend of mine told me ' you should take it easy in exposing yourself because you expose yourself too much in your film			0
' " and i said , ' i ca n't help it			0
' i mean , i want to be honest with my films , that 's why i 'm showing how i feel , my emotions , what i 'm going through			0
so that 's why i would say , you ca n't help to have a huge responsibility as a filmmaker , " he said .			0
