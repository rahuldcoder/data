-- for nearly a decade , a @entity2 bank has been recognized by the @entity3 to @entity4 as one of the best small to medium sized companies to work for in @entity7			1
situated near the quiet coastline on the island of @entity11 , @entity8 has an unusual approach to people management that experts say is worth noting			2
coaching , self - directed leadership and personal growth are not usually words associated with financial institutions , but to this bank 's 200 or so employees they are key , and the business operates under the assumption that everyone comes to work wanting to do their best , virtually eliminating the need for any oversight			1
sound utopian ? perhaps , but managing director of human resources , @entity29 says it works			0
" you 'd be amazed what happens once people are empowered to make decisions			0
" under the concept of self - directed leadership , every employee is coached to resolve 100 % of their work on their own , sometimes by making substantial monetary decisions without asking for help			1
" it forces people to step into character , " says @entity29 , " and they do			0
our employee satisfaction is very high , and for customers it means a highly individual treatment			0
there 's no one solution and we believe the only way to treat people the same is by treating them differently			1
as a result , 80 % of new customers come to us through referrals			0
" the bank was a leader in the use of @entity62 ( @entity62 ) as a coaching tool			1
it began with a simple chat between @entity29 and managing director , @entity67 in 1999			0
" we were wondering why we ended up in top positions at the bank , " says @entity29			1
" none of us were particularly clever in school , so we agreed that something else must have played a part			0
then we questioned why two employees with the same qualifications and training were not getting the same results , and we realized that those who succeeded had something extra : a will to succeed , a type of robustness if you will , and a belief in themselves that they were capable			2
and we thought we could train people to do this			0
" they did and they do			0
today , all new employees at the bank go through an @entity62 seminar and a self - directed leadership seminar			1
they train employees in empathy , stress management , and personal self - development , and they keep a coach on staff			1
@entity99 , the bank 's @entity62 master coach and hr director says it makes a tremendous positive difference			1
" it helps keep our employees really engaged and motivated			1
it keeps our sickness rates well below industry average , and it helps our leaders clarify their strategies , among many other things , " he says			0
" i think the biggest bang from coaching produces more of what i call " @entity124 , " says @entity113 , owner of @entity114 in the @entity115 and coach to several @entity117 and clients in @entity120 companies			0
" these are people who are continuously upgrading and learning , pushing their potential and that of the organization			0
" the @entity3 to @entity4 publishes lists of best places to work			1
it has been comparing thousand of global workplaces for years , and its research reveals more and more coaching in companies			0
" fundamentally though , it 's about respect and about helping people find work - life balance and deal with stress , says managing director for @entity2 , @entity145 , " it has to be a serious commitment			1
" @entity146 , professor of management at the @entity148 agrees			0
" self - directed leadership does n't mean less leadership			1
on the contrary , it demands strong leaders to create a framework of support for employees to reach their full potential			2
whether you call that coaching or something else , i think we 'll see more of it			0
" @entity164 says she is seeing much more of it			0
" sixteen years ago when i said ' i 'm a coach ' , people would ask , ' what sport ? ' it 's part of the corporate lexicon now			2
coaching is about the development of human potential - savvy companies get that that 's a true competitive advantage			2
" @entity176 executives now speak to companies big and small about the bank 's approach			1
but can this really work in larger companies ? @entity29 says absolutely			2
a few years ago when he discovered that the @entity182 in @entity183 was using nearly the same approach as his bank , he arranged a visit to interview the leadership and employees			1
" it was a company of 29,000 employees at the time , " he says , " and i had goosebumps at how similar their positive results and employee and customer feedback was to ours			2
so yes , it can most definitely work			2

a @entity2 bank has *repeatedly* been recognised as one of @entity7 's best places to work
the bank coaches its employees in self directed leadership
the strategy is shown to have kept its staff engaged and motivated
