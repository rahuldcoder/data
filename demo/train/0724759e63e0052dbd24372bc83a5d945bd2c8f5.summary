-- among all the woes of modern air travel -- cramped seating , extra charges for baggage , outrageous prices for airport food -- perhaps nothing frays the nerves of passengers faster than air turbulence			1
well , brace yourself for even bumpier skies			1
a pair of @entity17 scientists are predicting that the white - knuckle rocking and rolling at 35,000 feet is going to get worse			0
according to a paper published in the scientific journal , @entity23 , climate change will significantly increase turbulence over the @entity25 , a popular route between @entity27 and @entity28			1
the report concludes that " journey times may lengthen and fuel consumption and emissions may increase " as a result			2
read more : @entity0 @entity35 this means additional costs to airlines and , ultimately , passengers			2
currently , turbulence causes about $ 150 million a year in damages to planes and other expenses , said @entity44 , one of the report 's authors from the department of meteorology at the @entity49			2
there 's a high chance overall industry costs will rise as turbulence intensifies , he said			0
the report is based on a study of climate model simulations that suggest changes in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will dramatically increase the jarring rattle , shake , shimmy and sudden drops known all too well to frequent fliers			1

study results show that the area above the @entity25 that will experience " significant " turbulence will double , explained @entity44			1
" significant " turbulence can be classified as turbulence that would prompt a pilot to turn on the seat belt sign , he said			0
@entity68 told @entity0 he expects to find similar results when the team looks at the @entity83 region , between @entity84 and the @entity85 of the @entity86			0
so , in addition to everything else , expect to hear that " keep your seat belt fastened " reprimand a little more often as you fly the shaky skies .			0

report says passengers should brace themselves for bumpier skies and costlier flights
it says climate change will increase turbulence over the @entity25 , a popular route
the report is based on a climate model simulations , *impact* of changes in carbon dioxide levels
