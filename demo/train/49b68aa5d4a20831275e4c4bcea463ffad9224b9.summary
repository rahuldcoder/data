-- beneath a hand - stitched @entity3 flag , @entity1 prepared for battle			1
on this saturday afternoon , his work as colonel was nearly finished			0
he 'd trained new soldiers , devised field formations and passed combat instructions to captains leading the seven companies in his battalion			1
he 'd buttoned his thick , wool @entity15 uniform , filled his antique canteen and groomed his dark , wiry beard			1
now , @entity1 waited to storm @entity20 's @entity19			1
" honey , i wish they could see how you normally dress , " said his wife , @entity21			0
" we ai n't @entity27			0
" she swished up in a plaid , hoop skirt - inflated dress -- which is an ordeal to maneuver in the portable toilet , she admitted -- and touched his cheek			0
" somebody 's got ta play the @entity27 , " he said , grinning			2
@entity1 , 47 , has re-enacted enough @entity36 battles -- 300 , he estimates -- to know sometimes you must portray the squadron your ancestors fought			1
@entity41 re-enactors do n't always travel to the @entity42 for small battles , and this show featured just more than 100 soldiers			1
that 's pretty small skirmish compared with , say , @entity49 's 15,000 annual participants			1
he 's donned both uniforms throughout his 12 - year re-enacting career			1
rather than rallying the 48th @entity53 , his normal crew , he led the 23rd @entity55 , @entity15 soldiers who may ( or may not ) have surrendered to " homeguard - type " @entity57			1
there 's little documentation of what actually happened on that day in 1864 , other than @entity19 , a @entity3 iron compound , had been " blown up " by @entity64 forces			1
so , he and two other leaders planned an " educated guess " scenario , something " similar to what might 've been			0
" the @entity57 would prevail today ; union troops would conquer during sunday 's re-enactment			2
he watched his men line up , spines straight , listening to a lieutenant check weapons and bark orders			0
" shoulder -- arms ! " " support -- arms ! " there was no small talk , no laughter			0
getting into character , the character of a soldier , requires focus , diligence and a fastidious attention to historic detail			1
every face , young and old , remained stoic			0
" now remember , call for the medic if something 's seriously wrong , " the lieutenant shouted			2
onward march ! " 150 years of re-enacting before the @entity36 ended , re-enactments began			1
soldiers , freshly home from combat , recreated battle scenes to educate townspeople and honor fallen comrades			1
for @entity49 's 50th anniversary in 1913 , more than 50,000 @entity3 and @entity15 veterans returned to @entity103 to celebrate @entity105 's reunification			1
the former foes , ages 61 to an alleged 112 , re-enacted the gruesome clash to an awe - struck audience			2
after the @entity36 's centennial commemorations in the 1960s , modern portrayals trickled into mainstream pop culture			1
now , as the 150th anniversary approaches , thousands of @entity105 dress up to go back in time			1
re-enactment groups , located in nearly every state , never stop recruiting			0
" it 's an expensive hobby with a cult following , and a great way to learn about history , " said professor @entity117 , who teaches a @entity36 re-enactment course at @entity119 in @entity120			1
" people are meticulous about accuracy			0
" " hard - core " soldiers have led 20 - mile marches and followed strict " seasonal @entity36 " diets , he said			1
they often stay in character for a week			0
but most re-enactors perform for a day and then discuss jobs , families and whatever 's in the paper			1
it 's a tight - knit community			2
" their enthusiasm is very high , " he said			0
after a spectator sees history unfold before them , they 're much more likely to go out , buy a @entity36 book and learn more			1
above all else , re-enactors are educators			2
" @entity1 considers himself an unorthodox @entity36 teacher			1
" we 're living historians , " he said			0
" we re-enact to educate , to enlighten			0
it 's not a redneck hobby			2
" he remembers visiting @entity156 's @entity155 battlefield as a 10 - year - old boy , enamored by the monuments and their stories			2
now , as a retired teacher , he practices his passion with the @entity162 -- a @entity36 re-enactment fraternity scattered throughout @entity20 , @entity164 and @entity156			1
fellow re-enactors are his best friends , his family			2
re-enactments are an escape from reality , a chance to unplug , unwind and eat barbecue -- a far cry from the bloodshed during @entity105 's deadliest war			2
" re-enactments put emphasis on the battlefield itself -- the bravery , the heroism , the gallantry , " said dr. @entity175 , a specialist in @entity177 history at @entity178			0
" the larger context of the @entity36 , like the @entity177 economic devastation , the enormous death tolls , is conveniently moved to the side			1
" that can make commemorating tragic events cheerful , he said			0
" these re-enactments gather so much attention because they connect with @entity177 ' personal identities , " he said			2
" historic re-enactments become community festivals			2
" @entity20 pride @entity197 , a small town 60 miles northeast of @entity199 , buzzed with spectators as the 2 p.m. battle approached			2
" show them @entity27 ! " " @entity203 will rise ! " children waved @entity3 flags			1
mothers smoothed blankets onto the grassy hillside			0
old - style merchants , known on the re-enactment circuit as " suttlers , " pushed baked goods , overalls and antique jewelry on the sidewalk			0
it was a typical re-enactment weekend			0
@entity1 watched his men ready their guns			1
he checked his brass pocket watch , considering the 40 - minute time limit			0
sudden explosions arrested the crowd 's attention			1
puffs of smoke dotted the field , products of " blanks " in place of bullets , firing into the cloudless sky			0
cannons thundered back and forth			0
soldiers collapsed -- some wincing in fake pain , others stifling giggles			2
one man turned to his friend and yelled , " this is as much fun i can have with my clothes on ! " @entity21 watched from the sidelines			0
" @entity244 ! " she shouted intermittently , clapping her hands			0
but as always , regardless of what side he represented , she cheered for the @entity42			0
" ohh - wee ! " she shouted			0
" get them @entity27 ! "			0
