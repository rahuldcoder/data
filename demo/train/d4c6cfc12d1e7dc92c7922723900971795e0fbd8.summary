@entity1 refugee camp , @entity2 -- they carried teapots and tiny gas canisters , shopping bags filled with clothes and overstuffed bundles of blankets balanced on their heads			1
many held jerry cans , once full with water , now dangling empty			2
this was our first day in @entity2 , and nothing could have prepared us for the scene in front of us : hundreds of refugees from @entity21 making the long walk to safety in @entity2 , one long jagged line stretching out into the open desert			1
see more : stunning photo gallery of @entity21 's refugees the refugees came from the outskirts of @entity30 , walking for days in order to escape the ugly civil war that has engulfed their country for the past three years			1
their destination , like so many thousands before them , is the @entity1 refugee camp in @entity2			1
the numbers are staggering : @entity21 refugees are now estimated to make up 10 % of @entity2 's population			1
these are the scenes i remember the most from our journey from the @entity21 - @entity2 border to @entity1			1
the @entity45 from @entity21 two children clutching plastic soda bottles filled with olives from their family farm in @entity21			1
one exhausted woman , eight months pregnant , gratefully taking the hand of a @entity2 border police officer as she struggled over the dirt mound that marks the @entity21 - @entity2 border			1
@entity55 staff and @entity2 border police carrying bag after bag , child after child , and , most of all , the astonishing number of injured and sick brought in on wheelchairs			1
interactive map : @entity21 turn @entity1 into a home an old man sitting on his battered suitcase			1
he offered me a biscuit			2
when i asked him how old he was , he said maybe 90 or 95			2
" i do n't remember my birthday , " he said with a toothless smile			2
a woman who stopped and sat in the endless stretch of sand to feed her six - month - old child			2
she did n't want to be filmed			2
i spoke to her off - camera			0
she had travelled for three days from @entity30			0
her home had been destroyed			2
i asked about the baby			0
was he sleeping ? was she able to get enough food , produce enough milk to feed him ? she smiled shyly			0
i showed her a picture of my little boy			0
she let me take a photo of her beautiful baby			0
the " mayor of @entity1 " @entity1 is not simply a camp			1
more than 127,000 people have fled to the sprawling desert encampment since it opened in june 2012			0
if it was a city it would be the 5th largest in @entity2 -- and , in fact , @entity1 is much more like a city than you might imagine : hundreds of shops line a main road known as the " @entity99			1
" there are supermarkets and vegetable gardens , bicycle workshops and beauty salons			0
overseeing all this is @entity106			0
he has been called the " mayor of @entity1 " but he 's actually the @entity107 for the camp			1
he believes in tackling problems head on and always with an impish sense of humour			2
he was kind enough to let us tag along on one of his frequent afternoon strolls through the camp			0
it turned out to be one of the most entertaining tours i 've ever been on			0
a town called @entity1 the day in @entity1 begins with bread			1
at dawn , the @entity120 delivers millions of loaves of bread for distribution to the camp 's residents			2
many families send their children to fetch the daily bread			1
and they come running in , waving pink vouchers in their hands			0
they leave loaded down with bags of bread , five pieces per family member			0
but that 's only the start			2
in fact , @entity1 has a bustling economy : the @entity141 estimates that $ 12 million is exchanged in business transactions here every month			1
the population demographics in @entity1 are skewed towards women and children but also a surprising number of elderly residents			1
consider these statistics : more than half ( 54 % ) of the camp 's residents are under the age of 17			1
42 % of families in the camp are led by a female head of household			1
3 % are more than 60 - years old			1
@entity21 government demolished thousands of homes , report says @entity159 's story many of @entity1 's children bear the physical and emotional scars of war			1
six - year old @entity159 is one of them			0
she and her family survived a rocket attack on their home in @entity170 , but they were hit by a second rocket outside @entity30			2
@entity159 lost her leg in the blast and has struggled to cope			0
her father spoke to us about his heartbreak in seeing his bubbly daughter become quiet and withdrawn			0
@entity21 's 110 - year - old refugee one of my favorite moments was meeting @entity182			1
he 's does n't remember his birthday , so he does n't know exactly how old he is			2
but he reckons he is 110 - years old with more than 200 grandchildren			0
and he is a charmer			0
his eyes sparkle when he tells you stories of life in @entity21 before the @entity191 family came to power			1
and he recites poetry , lots of poetry , in a wavering voice			0
" @entity191 made beggars out of his people , " he told me			0
bringing beauty to @entity1 i expected to see many things in @entity1 : a bustling market - place , caravan homes under construction and many , many kids at play			1
i did not expect to get a facial experience in home - made spa			2
but that 's exactly what i got from @entity211 , the proprietor of @entity213 's @entity212 , one of three wedding shops in @entity1			1
i was really taken by her fearless attitude and candid views			0
we talked about the fears of the camp 's young women and why so many are now getting married much earlier			2
she also showed me how the simple act of applying lipstick is an act of resilience for the women of the camp			0
" even the bread does n't taste the same " @entity1 is the main collection point for @entity21 refugees in @entity2			1
but the vast majority of @entity21 's refugees actually live outside the camp , trying to find work in @entity2 's cities			1
we met with one man , a baker , hoping to find work on the outskirts of @entity241			0
he lives in one bare room with his family of five			0
he spoke to us on condition of anonymity because he fears his family at home in @entity21 could be targeted			1
but it 's very unlikely he 'll be able to find work			2
he lost his foot in a rocket attack , and his young son was crippled for life in the same attack			0
one of the most poignant moments , however , we did not catch on camera			0
we showed him the video we had shot of him using crutches to walk with his son			0
" look ! " he cried out , " when you fast - forward the video it looks like i am running again			0
at last ! " nothing can take away from the pain and loss of being a refugee			0
but everyone we met had a remarkable story of resilience and determination			0
@entity1 is a remarkable place because its residents are building a strong community out of what little they have			1
they build homes , invest in businesses , plant vegetable gardens and paint works of art. but every single @entity21 refugee i spoke to said the same thing : if the war stopped today , i would be home tomorrow .			1
