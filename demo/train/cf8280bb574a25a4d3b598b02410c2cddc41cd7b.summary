-- if recent trends are any indication , cartoon self - caricatures are becoming more popular than the clich√©d photo in the mirror headshot			2
@entity7 avatars , both classic and new , are hot right now			0
the cartoon - spawning series " @entity9 " is back			0
the critically and commercially successful @entity11 show about 1960s ad execs has revived its popular " @entity19 " campaign , which lets you create an animated doppelganger that smokes like a train and would n't be out of place in a film noir			1
since " @entity19 " launched a year ago , thousands of people adorned their @entity21 profiles with the retro caricatures			1
the trend was not unlike the personalized knockoffs of @entity27 's striking @entity26 design during the 2008 presidential election			0
the @entity29 , which is mentioned in the " @entity9 " season opener , created an iconic " hedcut " of the show 's lead character , @entity32			1
in other words , the @entity29 made a real hedcut of a fake person on a tv show , just as " @entity19 " encouraged real people to make fake versions of themselves			2
one artist , @entity40 , uses @entity43 's @entity42 video - chat capabilities to create user avatars			1
for $ 50 , @entity40 will do a cartoon portrait of you after chatting with you for about 20 minutes via the phone 's @entity48 app. @entity50 is not basing the portraits on photos but on videos -- although he will snap a screen shot of you for reference if he needs it			0
will this cartoon - avatar trend last ? probably not for long , as people may get sick of looking the same as all their @entity21 friends			2
but it may return with the next easily modifiable cartoon - portrait app. in the meantime , feel free to pre-emptively block the return of the bathroom mirror self - portrait -- there 's a @entity21 group for it .			0
