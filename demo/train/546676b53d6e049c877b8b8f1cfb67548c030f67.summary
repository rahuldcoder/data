all but two of the cases occurred in people who had recently visited northern @entity10 or , in one case , had contact with a visitor from northern @entity10 , the organization said			2
scientists at the @entity45 said the outbreak of infection in @entity10 is caused by a new " super-toxic " e. coli strain , though the @entity50 @entity49 said the strain has been seen before			1
" we have very little experience with this particular strain , but it has been seen before , " said @entity52 , deputy director of the @entity49 's division of foodborne diseases			1
the @entity49 said the strain is very rare and added that , while it is not aware of any cases ever having been reported in the @entity50 , it is aware of a few previous reports of the strain in other countries			1
@entity36 's @entity63 has said that the strain suspected in the outbreak is " rare " and " seldom seen in the @entity36			1
" though @entity15 said it does not recommend any trade restrictions related to the outbreak , @entity66 announced a ban thursday on fresh vegetable imports from the @entity71			2
@entity66 imposed the vegetable ban because " no one wants to get sick			0
it is a natural protective measure taken in response to events that are happening in @entity25 today , " @entity66 @entity75 spokesman @entity74 said thursday			0
@entity79 , head of the @entity66 @entity80 , issued a statement saying the ban will remain in effect " until we become convinced that this situation is resolved			0
" customs officials have been instructed to prevent the produce from entering the country , according to @entity79 , while supermarkets and food chains in @entity66 were told to withdraw @entity25 vegetables from their produce bins			2
@entity93 , the @entity94 's health spokesman , called the move " disproportionate			2
" " the commission will be writing today to the @entity66 authorities , and we will be liaising and working with them in the coming days to try to find a solution , " @entity93 said			0

@entity102 , @entity66 's agriculture minister , issued a statement assuring @entity66 that , despite the ban , " the volume of home - grown vegetable production combined with exports ( from other countries ) is sufficient to fully meet @entity66 's domestic demand			1
" in 2010 , the imports of tomatoes and cucumbers from the @entity71 amounted to , respectively , 11 % and 5 % of all imports of those vegetables into @entity66 , the @entity110 said			0
the ban could potentially affect some larger cities in the @entity25 part of the country , where about 90 % of vegetables are imported , said @entity121 , chairman of the @entity122			0
@entity123 and @entity124 are the two largest exporters of fresh vegetables into @entity66 , according to the @entity127			0

but authorities said thursday the source had not been pinpointed			0

@entity34 's ambassador to @entity36 , @entity141 , told @entity0 that @entity34 produce had been " completely cleared " and are " safe for all consumers			1
" but , he added , the matter had damaged the country 's growers " and we are sure there will have to be compensations " through the @entity71			0
@entity36 's @entity63 on thursday confirmed that there were four new cases in @entity150 suspected to be related to the outbreak , bringing the total number of cases in the country to seven			1
the agency said that it was " reminding people traveling to @entity10 to follow the advice of the authorities and avoid eating raw tomatoes , cucumbers and leafy salad including lettuce , especially in the north of the country , until further notice			0
in addition , anyone returning from @entity10 with illness including bloody diarrhea should seek urgent medical attention and make sure they mention their recent travel history			0
