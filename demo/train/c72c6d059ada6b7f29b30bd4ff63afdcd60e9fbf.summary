a @entity1 judge ordered a @entity3 hospital to remove a pregnant and brain - dead woman from respirators and ventilators on friday , perhaps ending a wrenching legal debate about who is alive , who is dead and how the presence of a fetus changes the equation			1
@entity13 , husband of @entity14 , broke down in tears after judge @entity16 told @entity17 to act on his order by 5 p.m. monday			2
@entity14 and other family members had been fighting to have the body released for burial			1
hospital officials resisted , saying they were trying to obey a @entity1 law that says " you can not withhold or withdraw life - sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient , " in the words of the hospital spokesman			1
@entity14 left the courthouse without talking to reporters , but the family 's lawyers spoke out			2
@entity33 argued that the hospital was " utilizing ( @entity14 's ) body as a science experiment			1
" a breakthrough came when the hospital and the @entity14 family agreed on crucial facts listed in a court document : that @entity14 , 33 , has " met the clinical criteria for brain death since november 28 " and that " the fetus gestating inside mrs. @entity14 is not viable			1
" the woman 's husband repeatedly made these claims in his efforts to have her removed from the machines			2
mom of pregnant woman : change the law the story may have more chapters			1
the hospital could appeal or decide to remove @entity14 from a ventilator and respirator before that deadline			1
the judge did not rule on the constitutionality of a state law regarding the treatment of a pregnant patient			1
@entity13 and @entity14 , two trained paramedics , had been awaiting the arrival of their second child when she was found unconscious on her kitchen floor around 2 a.m. november 26			0
she was rushed to the north - central @entity1 hospital			0
once there , @entity13 said , he was told his wife " was for all purposes brain dead			1
" the family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen			2
@entity13 had contended doctors told him his wife " had lost all activity in her brain stem " and an accompanying chart stated that she was " brain dead			1
" @entity80 said wife did n't want to be on ventilator during friday 's hearing in @entity3 , representatives of the hospital -- in this case , from the @entity87 district attorney 's office -- argued that state law was correctly applied			1
@entity90 and other family members said the hospital should abide by her wishes -- which were n't written down but , they said , relayed verbally to them -- and not have machines keep her organs and blood running			2
in an affidavit filed thursday in court , @entity13 said little to him now is recognizable about @entity14			0
her bones crack when her stiff limbs move			0
her usual scent has been replaced by the " smell of death			0
" and her once lively eyes have become " soulless			0
" after the friday hearing , another family lawyer , @entity110 , said , " pregnant women die every day			0
they die in car accidents , of heart attacks and other injuries			0
and when they die , their fetus dies with them			0
" it 's the way it 's always been and the way it should be			0
" lawyers : records back claim that woman is brain dead in his lawsuit , @entity14 claims subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and , in turn , the state law used to justify them -- amounted " to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family			1
" the hospital and the @entity87 district attorney 's office , which defended the medical facility , did not offer the same level of detail as members of the @entity14 family			2
but earlier this month , hospital spokesman @entity146 told @entity147 that his hospital believed " the courts are the appropriate venue to provide clarity , direction and resolution in this matter			0
" late friday , the hospital issued this statement : " @entity157 appreciates the potential impact of the consequences of the order on all parties involved and will be consulting with the @entity87 district attorney 's office			0
" when life support is really ' death support '			0
