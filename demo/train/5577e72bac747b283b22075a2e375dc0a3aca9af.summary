-- a comet is speeding toward a close - encounter with @entity2			1
@entity3 is expected to come within 87,000 miles of @entity2 at about 2:27 p.m. et on sunday -- very close for a comet flyby			1
the space rock is moving at about 126,000 mph ( 56 kilometers per second )			0
@entity6 thinks the comet will miss the @entity2 , but comets spew out a trail of dust and gas , and that could damage the fleet of spacecraft orbiting @entity2			1
" @entity2 will be right at the edge of the debris cloud , so it might encounter some of the particles -- or it might not , " @entity15 , chief scientist for the @entity16 at @entity6 's @entity17 said in a press release			2
" it only takes a half - a - millimeter - sized particle traveling at 56 kilometers per second to injure one of these spacecraft , " @entity23 , manager of the @entity24 said in a @entity6 video			0
just to be safe , @entity6 will move the @entity30 orbiter , @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , and the new @entity32 ( @entity32 ) to the other side of the planet as the comet approaches			2
" we 're going to hide behind @entity2 , " said @entity36 , @entity37 in the @entity38			0
" kind of like diving under your desk if there 's an earthquake and flying glass around			0
" see @entity6 's @entity47 video explaining comet flyby the orbiters will take pictures and collect data on the comet as it zips by			2
several @entity55 - based and space telescopes , including the @entity57 , also will take pictures			0
what about the probes on the surface of @entity2 ? @entity6 says the rovers are safe and will be protected by @entity2 ' atmosphere .			1

@entity3 to fly close to @entity2
@entity6 will move its orbiters to *dodge* comet dust
a fleet of space probes will *observe* the comet
