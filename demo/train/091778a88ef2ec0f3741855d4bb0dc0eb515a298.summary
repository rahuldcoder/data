-- on april 28 , 2003 , @entity1 threw open the virtual doors to its @entity3 , and music -- all digital media , really -- has n't been the same since			1
suddenly , an industry terrified of online piracy had a legitimate place to earn money from the sale of digital music			2
listeners no longer had to drive to their neighborhood record store ( remember those ? ) to buy that new album by @entity15 or @entity16			2
a song cost only 99 cents , a bargain next to an $ 18 cd			0
and @entity20 - powered ipods , with their signature white earbuds , became a must - have mobile accessory			1
record labels grumbled at being strong - armed over song prices by @entity1 ceo @entity27			1
some musicians complained that they did n't earn enough royalties from digital - music sales			1
but by 2010 , @entity20 was the largest music retailer on the planet			1
today , it has 435 million registered users in 119 countries and recently served up its 25 billionth song , downloaded by a man in @entity39			0
@entity20 also now sells much more than music : customers can download movies , tv shows , games , books , podcasts and more			1
in recent months , @entity1 's retail juggernaut has shown signs of weakness			1
recent figures show that its growth may finally be slowing down			0
and services such as @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and others , which allow users to stream songs for free or a modest monthly fee , are supplanting @entity20 among many young listeners			1
but its arrival 10 years ago this week was a sea change for anyone who makes , distributes or enjoys listening to music			2
@entity67 : the evolution of @entity20 here 's a look at some ways @entity20 changed music , and us : it celebrated the song , not the album thanks to @entity20 , all of a sudden , you did n't have to buy that @entity80 record to get " tubthumping " ( the " i get knocked down " song )			1
you could cherry - pick whatever songs you wanted instead of paying extra for the filler on an album or -- heaven forbid -- for a cd single			2
and sure enough , sales of songs far outpace sales of whole albums on @entity20			1
one downside of this is that artists have less incentive to make thematic concept albums			0
it 's hard to envision what the impact of " @entity101 " or " @entity102 " might have been in the @entity20 era			1
it rewarded impatience here 's the way it used to work : you 'd hear a song on the radio			2
you 'd have to figure out what it was ( a challenge in the days before @entity116 )			0
you 'd drive to a mall			0
you 'd search for the record			0
you 'd buy the record -- if it was in stock			0
you 'd put it in your cd player or on your turntable			0
finally , you 'd get to listen			0
now : hear song , download song			0
if the @entity127 has made the world 's knowledge accessible to almost anybody with a computer , @entity20 has done the same with music			1
according to @entity1 , the @entity3 now stocks more than 26 million songs , many of which are n't about @entity137 's ex-boyfriends			1
now , whether it 's @entity141 gamelan music or 13th - century @entity143 tunes , it 's all at our fingertips -- and we can sample it immediately			1
kids , you 've got no excuse			0
it killed the mixtape ahh , those lovingly made aural valentines , filled with oh - so - cool jams sure to impress your romantic interest or hipster friend			2
so fun to make , not always so fun to receive			0
sound quality ? eh , it 's good enough throughout the history of recorded music , the idea was usually to improve sound quality			1
as music went from scratchy cylinders to 78s to lps to cds , there was usually a corresponding leap in audio excellence			0
but the digital formats available from @entity20 , which compress audio files to make them easier to download , are a step down from cd quality			1
and you know what ? outside of audiophiles , nobody cares			0
the @entity3 and its digital brethren have helped clear the way for the " good enough " society			1
those smartphone photos ? not as good as a digital camera 's but good enough			0
that netbook ? not as powerful as a laptop but good enough			0
as @entity190 's @entity189 wrote , " having it here and now is more important than having it perfect			2
" it killed album art this week , @entity193 died			0
you probably do n't know his name , but you know his work : @entity193 was a graphic artist who designed album covers for @entity199 , @entity200 and 10cc , among many others			0
you may also have seen @entity193 's shrunken covers on @entity20 , where they have no more heft than an app icon			1
the song is the thing in the @entity20 world , and that means there 's less importance for the kind of artwork @entity193 did -- which , in its 12 - by - 12 - inch lp album cover form , was sometimes more impressive than the music it housed			1
yes , @entity20 offers booklets , images , videos and movies , but you ca n't frame those and hang them on a dorm room wall ... or use them to spread out , uh , study accessories			2
it made apps mainstream until july 2008 , apps were just something you ate before the main course			0
then came the @entity231 , a specialty shop inside the larger @entity20 department store , and @entity1 's iconic " there 's an app for that " campaign			1
soon , every early adopter was waving around their @entity239 , boasting about all the apps they 'd loaded onto it and slinging virtual birds at virtual pigs			0
the @entity245 only accelerated this trend			0
in january , @entity1 announced that more than 40 billion apps had been downloaded from its online store			2
' @entity249 ' a small minority of artists have refused to sell their music on @entity20			1
but one group in particular was unmoved by the move to digital downloads : the @entity256			0
thanks to legal disputes and sonic concerns , for more than seven years , the @entity256 ( and their many representatives ) resisted calls to transfer their prized catalog to @entity20 , leaving music fans stuck with their old - fashioned cds , lps and reel - to - reel tapes			1
that finally changed in 2010 , when the @entity256 ' @entity268 joined with @entity1 's core music distribution product			1
( yes , the use of the name " @entity1 " was another part of the dispute			2
) since then , the two have " come together " to the benefit of both			0
in the first week of availability , @entity20 sold 450,000 @entity256 albums and more than 2 million @entity256 songs			2
' curse you , @entity20 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ' despite its hundreds of millions of users , @entity20 has its critics			2
it 's become one of the most unpopular programs @entity1 offers			1
it 's slow to load , it 's a memory hog , and it likes to update seemingly every day			0
" wo n't someone take @entity20 out back and shoot it ? " @entity288 's @entity287 asked in an article as @entity20 11 was released			1
" each new upgrade brings more suckage into your computer			0
" @entity1 fanboys wait excitedly for most new @entity1 products			2
but for @entity20 ? not so much			2
and then there 's this : legally , you do n't own the songs you download on @entity20 ; you simply own the right to play them on your devices			1
so it might be a good idea to hang on to those old lps and cds -- and leave your passwords in your will .			0
