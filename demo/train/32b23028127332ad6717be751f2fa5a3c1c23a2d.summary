-- forget the new black			0
this is the real black			0
a @entity4 nanotech company has created what it says is the world 's darkest material			1
it is so dark the human eye ca n't discern its shape and form , creating what has been called a black hole			0
@entity13 , made out of carbon nanotubes , is designed by @entity15 and absorbs 99.96 % of all light that hits it			1
conventional black , such as black paint or fabric , absorbs between 95 % and 98 % of light			1
the company says @entity13 was the darkest material ever tested by the @entity24 in the @entity4 , as well as the @entity25 in the @entity26 the material is made up of millions of carbon nanotubes , each measuring two or three nanometers -- or roughly one millionth of a millimeter			1
it is grown on aluminium foil			0
creases and bumps on the foil are easily picked up by the human eye			0
but once covered with @entity13 , all wrinkles and roughness seem to disappear			0
" some people describe it as a hole , because there is literally not enough light coming from the surface to allow the eye to discern the contours that are in that foil , " @entity39 's @entity38 told @entity0			2
sound like the ultimate slimming little black dress ? actually , no. a @entity13 dress would render the curves and contours of the human body invisible and cause " the wearer to look like a two - dimensional cardboard cut out , " @entity38 said			2
instead , the material is designed to help air - borne cameras , telescopes and infrared scanning systems work more efficiently by reducing stray light			1
military clients are lining up to buy it , as is the space industry			0
the benefits , @entity38 said , are that " your systems can see fainter objects further away , you improve the sensitivity and you improve the signal to noise ratio in these systems			2
" the material , whose development was backed by the @entity4 's @entity73 , was launched at this year 's @entity74 in southern @entity75			1
according to @entity77 , chief technology officer of @entity15 , it was a " major breakthrough by @entity4 industry in the application of nanotechnology to optical instrumentation			1
" so far , @entity15 has only grown @entity13 on foil			2
it plans to grow it different materials and on three dimensional shapes			0
