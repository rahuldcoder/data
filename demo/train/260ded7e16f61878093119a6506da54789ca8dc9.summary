-- for his efforts to protect @entity4 children from parasites , @entity1 was honored as a @entity6 in 2007			1
his story inspired actor @entity8 , who became involved with @entity1 's organization , @entity10			1
since 2004 , @entity10 has helped millions of children around the world through its deworming project called stomp the worm			1
it also has formed several children 's homes in @entity4 and @entity18			1
@entity0 's @entity19 recently caught up with @entity1 to talk about his group 's expanding efforts and his collaboration with @entity8			1
@entity19 : what success has your group had with @entity14 the worm ? @entity1 : when @entity6 highlighted our project , it brought a tremendous amount of awareness to the cause			1
we had dewormed 1.7 million children at the time			1
last year alone , we dewormed 8 million			1
most people know us for our worm initiative in @entity4 , but we 've dewormed in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39			1
we 've also treated a half million in @entity40			2
now we 're trying to work on a fund where we deworm 1 million children a month			1
we 're purchasing the medication now at 1.3 cents , so we can deworm around 66 kids for $ 1			1
@entity19 : why is deworming so important ? @entity1 : you can see hungry children eating three times a day , and if they 're not dewormed they 're still lethargic , have high rates of anemia			1
they 're slowly wasting away			0
we can provide a treatment that 's just over 1 cent , and the kids come back to life within a day or two			1
seeing these kids run around after being dewormed , it 's an amazing thing			1
and then you reflect that , " wow , this cost us one penny			0
" we did n't invent the deworming initiative , but we are happy to get it out there and show people the importance of it			0
... we 'd love for people to help us reach our 1 - million - a - month goal			1
@entity19 : how many children 's homes has @entity10 opened , and how do they work ? @entity1 : we now have seven children 's homes : four in @entity4 and three in @entity18			1
we 're working on a fourth in @entity18 now for refugee children from @entity73			1
we 're opening it in @entity75 , where the @entity76 lives			0
maybe he 'll come visit us			0
we keep our homes small			2
we have a rule : no more than 10 ( children ) in each home , because we want to keep them very family - style			2
we try to keep the kids growing up like brothers and sisters			0
if we want to expand to help more children , we open another home			2
one of the homes in @entity18 is for handicapped children			1
one in @entity4 is for hiv - positive children			1
are you making a difference in your community ? share your story in a short video			0
@entity19 : how are your homes impacting children 's lives ? @entity1 : some of these kids we 've had for about eight years			1
it 's amazing seeing these kids grow up and seeing what they 're able to do			2
some of them came from the @entity109 slum			0
( now ) they 're healthy			0
we have a school they 're enrolled in			0
they participate in music five days a week ; we more or less have our orphan band in @entity4			1
they have a chance at life and hopefully will become future leaders of @entity4 or elsewhere			1
we have a policy where we do n't adopt our kids out			0
we 're not going to help @entity4 -- or whatever country we 're working in -- if we send the kids away			2
that might help that particular kid 's situation , but not @entity4 as a whole			1
@entity19 : how did the earthquake impact your work in @entity4 ? @entity1 : that really shook our foundation from all fronts			1
we were in the middle of our national deworming program and treating every child -- all 3.2 million kids -- and we had distributed half of that			2
if the earthquake had hit two weeks later , we would have gotten all the medication out to every child			0
it postponed the distribution ; it shifted the population of the country so we did n't know what areas we had dewormed in ( or ) who we dewormed			2
we had to wait before passing out the meds again			0
@entity19 : what about your children 's homes ? @entity1 : we were extremely fortunate			1
all five buildings we own -- our school plus four homes -- all stood up			2
we had to move out of two of the homes , but we were very fortunate			2
one of our homes sits on a hill -- our @entity165 home -- and i was worried about that			2
when i got to @entity4 , that home barely had a scratch on it and the two right next to it had collapsed			2
we were extremely , extremely fortunate			0
@entity19 : what impact has @entity8 's involvement had on your efforts ? @entity1 : @entity8 has been extremely beneficial on all fronts , helping bring awareness and raise money for the cause			1
he 's making the cause a little cooler now that he 's a part of it			0
he 's just been a great help			0
he 's traveled to @entity4 a couple times			1
he recently did a fundraiser to help us raise money to start a new orphanage			0
he 's put us in contact with some amazing people that have helped us			2
@entity19 : where else will your travels take you this year ? @entity1 : i 'm going to @entity194 in february			2
we 're looking at a rainforest initiative there			0
we own some rainforest land in @entity199 -- 1,000 acres -- for preservation , and we 're looking to do the same model in @entity194			0
we purchased land in @entity199 about two and a half years ago			0
it 's in the @entity204			0
most people think that rainforest is being destroyed because people are going in and cutting trees			0
that is true on some level , but ... the forest is mostly being destroyed by cattle farming using a slash - and - burn technique			0
farmers come in , buy the land and light it on fire and burn it down			0
our goal is to purchase the land so no one can come in and destroy it			0
we leave it alone , and we watch over ( it )			0
it 's said that two out of every 10 breaths we take come from the @entity204 rainforest			0
it 's important to preserve that for our future .			0
