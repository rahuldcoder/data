@entity1 @entity0 may be the @entity3 , but for a few minutes on monday , he was also @entity4 , outgoing host of " @entity5			1
" @entity0 sat down for an interview with @entity4 in @entity1 -- his third appearance on the show -- and surprised the host by taking over the taping for a segment			1
" you 've been taking a lot of shots at my job , i 've decided to take a shot at yours , " @entity0 said before taking over for @entity4 on " @entity12 , " a segment where @entity4 ( in this case , @entity0 ) says a line or two before a witty word or phrases flashes to the right			1
" how hard can this be ? i am just going to say whatever you were about to say			0
" from there , @entity0 launched into a monologue about @entity28 , congressional @entity29 and his last two years in office			1
" @entity32 , " @entity0 said , referring to his audience like @entity4 does			1
" as you know , i , @entity4 , have never cared for our president			1
that guy is so arrogant			0
i bet he talks about himself in the third person			0
" after talking about @entity28 , the president asked , " how do you stop something that more and more people are starting to like ? " next to @entity0 flashed " move it to @entity43 , " a nod to the fact that in two weeks @entity4 will be stepping down from his @entity47 show to take over for @entity48 at the " @entity49 " on @entity43			1
the president went on to detail how @entity29 could stop @entity28			1
" they could pass a bill repealing @entity28			2
but the president still has the veto and if i know that guy , he is willing to use it , " @entity0 said			1
" and let 's face it , even if @entity29 somehow did repeal it , they would have to replace it with their own health care plan			0
once they touch it , they own it , and then if anything goes wrong , suddenly everybody will be complaining about @entity65 - care			0
" " @entity67 " then flashed next to the president			0
near the close of the segment , @entity0 joked , noting that last year 's @entity28 rollout was " a little bumpy			1
" " i think that is where @entity75 got the idea for @entity78 , " the president said to laughs			0
@entity0 stayed in character for the end of the segment , too			2
" we will be right back with the leader of the free world , " the president said , looking at his page like he could n't remember his own name before adding , " @entity0			2
" following a break , @entity0 and @entity4 sat down for a somewhat more traditional interview , where the president defended his decision to issue an executive action on immigration reform and the recent positive jobs report			1
" the economy is growing at a faster rate than it has for years , " @entity4 said			2
" why did n't you fix the economy before the midterm elections ? i would have done it before the midterms so people were happy when they voted			0
" " actually , the economy has been on a pretty good run , " @entity0 said , before listing a number of economic indicators about job creation and growth that his @entity106 regularly pushes			2
" i 'll give it to you			0
you 've employed a lot of people , mostly as secretary of defense , " @entity4 said , a crack at the fact that @entity0 recently parted ways with his third , @entity119 , and nominated his fourth , @entity120			1
on immigration , @entity0 said his decision to issue an executive order is " scrupulously within the law " and something that both @entity127 and @entity128 presidents have done			0
" you realize you are an emperor now			0
it has been declared , " @entity4 joked , referring to an attack some @entity29 used against the president during his immigration decision			2
" you are @entity135 the @entity136			0
" @entity0 seemed to enjoy his time behind " @entity5 " desk , too			1
" i will say , i felt more powerful behind that desk , " @entity0 said			0
@entity4 responded with a self - deprecating joke : " with great power comes medium cable ratings			0
