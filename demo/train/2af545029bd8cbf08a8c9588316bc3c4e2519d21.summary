-- creativity has taken center stage in recent years , with a slew of books , articles and @entity7 talks extolling the virtues of imagination and exhorting young and old to go out and exercise their creative muscle			1
in a 2010 @entity13 poll of @entity14 worldwide , creativity was identified as the single most important leadership trait for success , enabling businesses to rise above an increasingly complex environment			1
the future belongs to " creators and empathizers , pattern recognizers and meaning makers , " declared author @entity24 in the introduction to his best - selling book " a @entity27 : why right - @entity28 will rule the @entity29			0
" creativity also matters to our emotional well - being as we find our way in an uncertain , rapidly shifting world			1
imagination underpins our ability to remain resilient during difficult and stressful times since creative people tend to be more tolerant of ambiguity and better able to come back from defeat			1
and yet , despite its growing importance , creativity suffers from an odd sort of paradox			1
according to psychologist and @entity47 management professor @entity46 , research shows that even as people explicitly aspire to creativity and strongly endorse it as a fundamental driving force of positive change , they routinely reject creative ideas and show an implicit bias against them under conditions of uncertainty			1
subjects in @entity46 's study also exhibited a failure to see or acknowledge creativity , even when directly presented with it			1
it would appear that we suffer from a bias against creativity			1
but we are in denial about it , possibly because of what it may say about us			0
" because there is such a strong social norm to endorse creativity , and people also feel authentic positive attitudes toward creativity , people may be reluctant to admit that they do not want creativity ; hence , the bias against creativity may be particularly slippery to diagnose , " @entity46 and her colleagues suggest			1
why the bias ? " creativity is doing something differently than you 've done before , " says @entity76 , a neuroscientist and founder of @entity78 , a hybrid art studio and science lab. from an evolutionary standpoint , uncertainty was a bad thing			1
" if you were n't sure that there was a tiger in front of you , by the time you were sure it was too late , " @entity86 observes			0
" our brains thus evolved to take uncertainty and make it certain			1
" @entity46 says , " we are intolerant of uncertainty in general			1
the more creative something is , the more novel it is			2
and the more novel it is , the greater the uncertainty we are likely to have about its feasibility			2
" these negative associations tend to be unacknowledged , and there is evidence that they are unconscious , as in the case of executives who demand creativity but continue to reject creative ideas			1
herein , however , lies the dilemma : creativity is what we need to help us get through times of greatest uncertainty and difficulty			1
and it 's exactly during those times , perhaps when we need it most , that we are least likely to embrace creativity			1
imagination scares us because it demands a foray into the unknown			0
" but only by going into a space of uncertainty can we do anything new , " @entity76 says			2
" that is a tremendous challenge , is n't it ? " another reason for the bias against creativity may be the perception that something can either be creative or practical , but that much more rarely can it be both			1
many ( and perhaps even most ) people hold the belief that for every success story such as @entity137 , the " patron saint of the creative class , " there are thousands ( or more ) chronically unemployed and underemployed " artists			1
" this belief gives rise to a duality , where practical and creative endeavors lead largely separate existences -- one slogged at during the workweek and the other indulged on nights and weekends , or dismissed as a luxury			1
the creativity versus practicality dissonance also manifested in aspects of @entity46 's research			1
she refers to the two separate mind - sets of the " why " people and the " how " people			2
people focused on " why " tend to frame the world in more abstract ways			2
in general , they do n't tend to have feasibility concerns			0
those who are in a " how " mind - set , however , are so focused on feasibility that they are likely to overlook or dismiss creative ideas			1
" most boardrooms are all ' how , ' and the ' why ' is crushed , " @entity46 says			0
" this is why @entity137 was so remarkable			0
he had a solid grasp of the ' why ' and was also able to overcome objections to the ' how			0
' he was able to overcome the reality distortion field			0
" the folly of seeking certainty there are a number of problems with our obsession with creating certainty , and the most important is that certainty does not exist			2
" @entity180 is an illusion ! a delusion ! " @entity86 says			0
or , as @entity186 once said : " if you want a guarantee , buy a toaster			0
" the second problem is that the more we seek to create tools to make life predictable -- from packaged foods to @entity192 , gps devices to smartphones , @entity195 to trip advisor -- the more we diminish aspects of our brains capable of dealing with the unexpected			2
" technology is an amazing empowerment and a huge disablement , " says @entity199 , principal designer at frog design			0
" we are losing our capacity for resilience			0
" @entity199 is a big believer in the " @entity208 " manifesto			0
( @entity208 , of course , was the ever - resourceful television character who was able to solve complex problems with duct tape , paper clips and any other material he found handy			0
) " i remember being locked out of the house once when i was growing up , " @entity199 says			0
" i found an old ruler , somehow prodded up the window latch and got in			0
it was an amazing sense of accomplishment			0
" she says some of our best stories are about those times when we were forced into something and had to use ingenuity to find our way out			0
@entity199 says she believes that the future favors the flexible			0
she quotes make magazine founding editor @entity231 , honored by the @entity233 as a @entity234 , who wrote : " our future security lies in knowing what we are capable of creating and how we can adapt to change by being resourceful			0
" becoming comfortable with uncertainty is it possible to overcome our inclination toward the predictable ? @entity46 notes an important exception to our avoidance of the unknown			1
research shows that the framing of uncertainty changes the way people react			1
" we do n't mind uncertainty when it 's associated with something positive , like hope , " she says			1
" frame something positively , and people will behave differently			2
" @entity255 , founder of the design firm @entity256 , observes , " creativity is being comfortable with having ideas and not fearing being judged when you put your ideas out there			1
" @entity263 , recognized as one of @entity266 's leading design innovators , is passionate about democratizing creativity by helping people develop creative confidence			1
he 's not , however , teaching people how to be creative			1
" they are inherently creative , " @entity263 says			2
" all we are doing is taking away the blocks			0
" those blocks form early , according to @entity263			0
though young children are naturally and unabashedly creative , they either opt out of thinking of themselves as creative or have it hammered out of them in elementary school			2
" a kind of atrophy sets in , when they start to trust their analytical minds but not their intuitive minds			0
" removing those blocks has a great deal to do with fear			2
he suggests approaching the fear of creativity the same way you would approach any other kind of phobia , such as the fear of heights or snakes			1
@entity263 finds that creative confidence carries over into other aspects of people 's lives -- in the way they solve problems , sing karaoke , throw dinner parties			1
" once you have done something dangerous and succeeded , you try it in other places			0
and you begin to learn how to synthesize your experience and intuition to make complex and important decisions			2
" with the challenges we are facing , we need to rethink what creativity means , @entity199 says			2
we need to expand what we mean by creative			2
creativity is not just about painting or drawing or art. it is about problem - solving			0
it 's the flexibility of your mind , the ability to see things that no one can see and envision something entirely different			0
we are creating the future , bringing about change			0
and there is something incredibly empowering about that .			0

people routinely reject and show bias against creative ideas , @entity336 says
poll of @entity14 : creativity is the single most important leadership trait for success
people reject creativity because of uncertainly -- but it 's needed to help us through uncertainty
innovator : build confidence by treating fear of creativity like a phobia of heights or snakes
