@entity0 -- one year after the @entity4 administrator brought efforts to privatize airport screening to a virtual standstill , @entity2 has kick - started the program , opening the door for other airports to " opt out " of @entity4 screening			1
a provision in the just - passed @entity14 reauthorization bill requires @entity4 chief @entity15 to approve airport requests to privatize their screeners unless he determines it would harm security			1
that is likely to open the doors to further privatization , since @entity15 has said private screening and government screening is " comparable			2
" currently , 16 airports , the largest being @entity26 , have private screeners under the @entity4 's @entity28			1
the screeners are overseen by @entity4 supervisors , use the same x-ray and scanning equipment and wear similar uniforms			2
but they work for private companies			0
one year ago , @entity36 announced he was freezing the program , saying he believed airport screening to be a federal responsibility , and saying privatization hurt @entity4 flexibility and added to administrative costs			1
@entity15 said he would approve additional airports only if there was a " clear and substantial " advantage to the federal government			0
but the @entity4 checkpoints -- and the 50,000 jobs they represent -- were an irresistible battlefield for free - market @entity51 and union - supporting democrats			1
at a hearing monday on the issue , @entity54 lamented the provision in the @entity14 reauthorization , saying it signals a return to the days before the terror attacks of september 11 , 2001 , when private companies provided airport security			1
" let us not forget the lessons of the past ... the 9/11 day of horror was partly on the watch of privatized screeners , " said rep. @entity66 , @entity67			0
republicans and an association for private security companies called that argument specious			0
private screeners were adhering to standards set by the @entity14 , they said			2
republicans depicted the current system as inefficient , and said the bloat extends to the @entity4 oversight of privatized airports			1
" there are certain airports where contractors do screening and @entity4 is just there to oversee the screen ( ing ) process ; there are upwards of 50 @entity4 employees on the payroll , " said subcommittee chairman rep. @entity81 of @entity82			1
" having 50 - plus @entity4 officials in a single airport where they are not responsible for conducting screening is just plain overkill and it 's costing the taxpayer huge amounts of money , " he said			2
@entity100 rep. @entity100 , @entity101 , " i want to get you out of the personnel business and into the security business			0
" rep. @entity105 , @entity106 , called the hearing " a day late and a dollar short , " noting the passage of the @entity14 reauthorization			1
@entity2 was " micromanaging " @entity36 by stripping him of discretion to determine which airports are privatized			2
@entity105 asked @entity15 whether privatized screeners performed better than their federal counterparts			0
" i believe that they all -- every assessment is -- that they perform comparably to the federalized work force both in terms of security and in terms of customer engagement , " @entity15 answered			0
the 16 airports that use private screeners are , @entity26 ; @entity126 , @entity127 ; @entity128 , @entity129 ; @entity130 , @entity131 ; @entity132 , @entity106 ; @entity133 , @entity134 ; @entity135 , @entity136 ; @entity137 , @entity138 ; @entity139 , @entity140 ; and seven small airports in @entity142			0
@entity36 last week approved privatization of the @entity144 , a seasonal airport in @entity142 that has relied on a flown - in core of screeners			0
he rejected two other airports .			0

@entity2 recently passed the @entity14 reauthorization bill
it would allow @entity154 airports to " opt out " of @entity4 screening and privatize
@entity51 say the current system is bloated and , in some cases , *redundant*
@entity54 say the provision *compromises* *safety* , *undermines* @entity4 authority
