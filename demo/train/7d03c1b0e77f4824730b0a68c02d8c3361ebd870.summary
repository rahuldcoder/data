-- when asked if i miss being in government , i usually try to lighten the moment by responding that i awake most days , read the paper , and then observe that , " it 's yet another great day to be the former director of the @entity8			0
" of course , this casual answer is designed to limit comment on the things i miss ( largely the mission and the people ) and especially the things i do n't ( a longer list )			1
but lately my half - flippant answer seems a little more true than i ever wanted it to be			0
and its somber implications apply not just to the director of @entity8 but to other senior intelligence officials as well			1
these jobs have always been hard			0
while i was at @entity8 , a prominent @entity23 ( not in government , but very accustomed to calculating risk ) once asked me , " on a scale of zero to 10 , how would you rate @entity8 analysis ? " i began my answer on @entity8 analysis -- and by extension on the entire @entity23 intelligence enterprise -- by noting that " eight , nine and 10 are not on our scale			1
if you can get to those numbers , nobody is asking us those questions			0
" using a baseball metaphor , i concluded that " all the pitches we see seem to be hard sliders on the outside corner at the knees			0
" that 's hard enough , but today the intelligence community seems unduly burdened with questions beyond this permanent , almost existential , dilemma			2
take @entity47 , for example			1
some have described what happened before the attack in which a @entity23 ambassador and three other @entity23 died as an intelligence failure			1
really ? if someone needed more information to know that security there had deteriorated beyond the point of safety , they were n't waiting for warning -- they were waiting for someone to die			1
good people made bad decisions , but it was n't because they were unaware of the situation on the ground			2
then there is the aftermath of @entity47 : what did we know , when did we know it and how did the administration choose to express it ? the intelligence community is still living with the consequences of what could be described as a public debate badly crossing the wires of political speech with those of analytic thought			1
an intelligence analyst may attribute an attack to @entity86 , whereas a policy maker could opt for the more general " extremist			2
" it 's still not clear what happened in this case ( or why ) and both speakers could technically be correct , but it is never a good thing for the analyst to be drawn into a debate to explain or justify the word choices of the politician			0
director of national intelligence @entity100 's office seemed forced to do just that in late september			2
surely what happened before and after those fateful hours in @entity47 is of national importance and our political processes need to adjudicate these questions			1
but at their heart these are now more political and policy debates than intelligence issues			1
then there 's this movie , " @entity115 " about the hunt for @entity114			1
some have complained that too many " secrets " were dished out by the intelligence and special operations communities to director @entity119 , screenwriter @entity120 and their crew , part of a broader pattern of using intelligence for political effect			1
there are now reports that one of the intelligence community 's stars , under secretary of defense @entity131 , may have leaned too far forward in talking to the film 's creators			2
but i am glad that someone took the trouble to chronicle an @entity23 intelligence success			2
but even that narrative is controversial			0
so controversial in fact that acting cia director @entity142 felt compelled to issue a note to his workforce last week reminding them that the movie was a work of fiction , not a documentary			0
and three members of the @entity151 are on record demanding that @entity153 issue a disclaimer on the role of @entity8 enhanced interrogations in the hunt for @entity114			0
here 's what i know about the film 's controversial aspects : the scenes of @entity8 interrogation are overwrought and inaccurate ; more than detainee - derived data was key in getting to @entity165 ; and the film 's star , " @entity166 " , was not alone in urging the agency to move			0
but as often happens in art , each of these story lines has a thread of truth			2
@entity8 interrogations of more than 30 detainees were tough ; the agency did derive significant intelligence from them ; and " @entity166 " was a real heroine			2
at the end of the day , though , " @entity115 " is a movie			1
that this is being debated and that intelligence leaders are being drawn into that debate is as revealing as it should be troubling			0
when i was at @entity8 i asked my civilian advisory board to tackle some tough questions			0
among the toughest : in a political culture that every day demands more transparency and more public accountability from every aspect of national life , could @entity23 intelligence continue to survive and succeed ? that jury is still out			1
one hopes that in the new year our intelligence professionals -- from seniors like @entity100 , @entity142 and @entity131 to the newest arriving analyst -- can disentangle themselves from these public disputes and focus on their core responsibilities			0
responsibilities like gauging the spread of @entity86 affiliates in @entity205 , helping decision makers judge whether the @entity207 in @entity208 is a bridge or a barrier to @entity212 fanaticism , identifying what part ( if any ) of the @entity215 opposition can be trusted , or giving all of us confidence that we can detect an @entity219 nuclear breakout before it is too late			0
working on that stuff actually constitutes the definition of a " great day			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity224 : controversy *unfairly* *surrounds* intelligence officials ' roles in two @entity230 issues
he says political fights have obscured reality in both areas
he says the @entity47 security *breakdown* was n't an intelligence failure
@entity224 : " @entity115 " has elements of truth , but is dramatized in @entity181 style
