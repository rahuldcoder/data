-- @entity1 said he does n't think domestic terrorist - turned - housewife @entity2 served nearly enough time for his mother 's murder , but he 's relieved the saga ended with @entity2 's tuesday release from prison			1
@entity2 was released from a @entity11 prison tuesday after serving seven years			1
@entity2 , a member of the self - styled revolutionary @entity13 -- perhaps best known for kidnapping @entity14 -- was released from a @entity11 prison after serving seven years , the @entity12 said			1
she was released to her husband just after midnight and is expected to serve her yearlong parole term in @entity18 -- over the the objections of police unions and @entity18 gov. @entity21			1
her sentence stems from her involvement in the 1975 attempted bombings of two police cars and the slaying of @entity27 during a bank robbery that same year			1
back then , @entity2 went by her birth name , @entity30			1
after her 1976 indictment in the attempted bombings , she changed her name and started a new life in @entity35 , @entity18			1
she was not apprehended until 1999			0
" i 've really got nothing to say			0
she did her time , as minimal as that may have been , " said @entity1 , who was 15 when his mother was killed			0
" one of those years -- just one -- was for the murder of my mom and the bank robbery up in @entity45			1
" @entity27 , a mother of four , was depositing money at the @entity47 for her church when she was shot by @entity2 's co-defendant @entity49 , according to court documents			1
@entity51 was sentenced to eight years ; she served four and was released on parole in february 2007			1
@entity1 , now 49 , said he never understood why it took so long to bring his mother 's killers to justice			0
while charges were filed in the bombings within months , no charges were brought in his mother 's murder until 2002			0
" you expect thugs to do what thugs do , but you do n't expect the district attorney to turn a blind eye to the murder of an upstanding citizen , " @entity1 said monday			0
@entity2 's release tuesday will cap an oft - strange storyline that spans more than three decades and which saw @entity2 wear the hats of college student , 1970s radical , housewife and philanthropist			1
attorney @entity77 met @entity2 , now 62 , shortly after she moved to @entity35 through friends in the reggae band , @entity80			1
@entity81 , @entity2 's husband , played trumpet in the band , @entity77 said			1
" she did good deeds everywhere			0
she raised three wonderful daughters			0
it was always a shock to all of us that the @entity2 we know had that past , " @entity77 said			1
after attending the @entity88 , @entity88 , @entity2 moved to @entity89 in the early 1970s			2
there , she met @entity91 in 1972 , and the two became best friends and roommates , @entity2 told @entity95 in a 2002 interview shortly before she was imprisoned			2
after @entity91 and five other @entity13 members were killed in a 1974 gunfight with the @entity99 , @entity2 appeared at a memorial in @entity89 's @entity101 to eulogize her friend			1
" @entity13 soldiers , although i know it 's not necessary to say , keep fighting			2
i 'm with you , and we are with you , " @entity2 told the crowd			2
almost a year later , @entity2 took part in two bank robberies to help fund the @entity13 , according to court documents			1
during the @entity45 robbery , @entity2 " entered the bank with a firearm and kicked a nonresisting pregnant teller in the stomach			1
the teller miscarried after the robbery , " the documents said			1
in august 1975 , @entity120 police found homemade bombs under two squad cars			2
they were designed to explode when the car moved , but neither device detonated			0
authorities cast the attempted bombings as payback for the bloody shootout that left @entity91 and other @entity13 members dead			2
a probe into the gunbattle helped police arrest @entity133 , the granddaughter of publishing mogul @entity133 , who claimed she had been kidnapped , raped and brainwashed by the @entity13			1
in her book " @entity14 , " @entity133 put @entity2 at the center of the @entity45 robbery			1
according to the @entity139 @entity138 , " she evaded capture for 23 years , and in the meantime , became a doctor 's wife , mother of three , community volunteer , veteran of charity work in @entity148 and practicing @entity149 living in an upscale neighborhood in @entity35			1
" though authorities said a 1999 " @entity158 " episode marking the 25th anniversary of the @entity157 shootout led to @entity2 's arrest , the show 's web site mentions neither @entity2 nor @entity30 among its almost 1,100 " captures			2
" her @entity18 friends and neighbors were shocked , even incredulous , when she was arrested			2
they pleaded with a judge to grant her bail			0
the @entity166 began selling cookbooks , titled , " serving @entity165 : @entity168			0
" it would help that @entity2 was generous with her time			2
she was active in the church			0
she volunteered for political campaigns			0
@entity77 said he had a blind client to whom she used to read the @entity174			0
@entity2 's philanthropy , coupled with the connections of her husband , a respected emergency room doctor , made raising the $ 1 million bail relatively easy , said @entity77 , who remembers that some members of the community had so much faith in @entity2 they put up their children 's college funds			2
on october 31 , 2001 , @entity2 pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to ignite a destructive device or explosive			2
she later tried to rescind the plea , saying " cowardice " prevented her from telling the truth			0
a superior court judge , however , denied her request and in january 2002 sentenced her to 20 years to life in prison , a sentence the parole board later reduced			1
@entity2 was charged with @entity1 's slaying that same week and pleaded guilty in 2003 to second - degree murder			2
@entity2 received a sentence of five years to life			1
the @entity12 said in a statement that @entity2 's sentence was reduced for good behavior and for her work on a maintenance crew that cleaned the main yard of the @entity205 in @entity206			0
@entity77 said " it 's right " that @entity2 served time , but he is glad she is being released			0
he expects many hugs await her in @entity35 and that she will soon be back to her generous ways			0
" i really believe who we knew in @entity35 was the true @entity2 , " he said			0
the @entity212 disagrees and has loudly opposed her early release			0
sgt. @entity214 , the league 's chief , called her a sociopath who " never said she was sorry			0
" he also lashed out at those who rush to defend her			0
" enough with the bs that she was unfairly targeted by law enforcement for her youthful indiscretions -- she is a criminal , " @entity214 said in a monday statement			0
corrections officials say it 's important that she be reunited with her family during her parole -- it helps reduce recidivism -- but @entity18 legislators , the governor and the @entity233 have asked gov. @entity234 to keep her in @entity11 over the next year			1
" letting a domestic terrorist like @entity2 set the terms of her parole is an insult to the memory of @entity27 and all the men and women of @entity99 past and present , " the @entity35 union said in a letter last week			1
@entity1 , however , just wants to put @entity2 out of his mind			0
" get her out of here , " he said			0
" i do n't want to see or think about her again			0

new : governor , police unions oppose @entity2 serving parole in @entity18
@entity2 evaded capture for more than 20 years living as @entity18 housewife
@entity2 was member of @entity13 , which nabbed @entity14
