-- the hottest field in science this past decade has been neuroscience			0
that explosion in research , and our understanding of the human brain , was largely fueled by a new technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity11 ) that became widely available in the 1990s			1
well look out ! another technology - based neuroscience revolution is in the making , this one perhaps even bigger			1
the term to watch for in 2013 is " optogenetics			1
" it 's not a sexy term , but it is a very sexy technology			1
the heritage of optogenetics goes way back to 1979 , when @entity22 laureate @entity21 , co-discoverer of the structure of @entity24 with @entity25 and @entity26 , suggested that neuroscientists should seek to learn how to take control of specific cells in the brain			1
well , that certainly would seem to be an advance with great potential			0
imagine being able to turn the neurons in an animal 's brain on and off from the outside			1
sounds like you 'd be turning the creature into a robot , sounds like science fiction			0
right ? well , flash forward thirty - some years , and guess what , optogenetics is a reality ! here 's how it works ... roughly			2
an obvious approach would be to stick a tiny electrode into an animal 's brain and stimulate the cells using electricity			2
today we have tiny microelectrodes , but they are still too crude for the job			0
@entity21 speculated that light could be the tool to use			0
that turned out to be true : @entity58 involves inserting fiber - optics tools into an animal 's brain , in order to control the target neurons using pulses of light as a trigger			1
learning to shine light on a neuron is not the whole answer , though			0
in order for the method to work , the neurons have to be re-engineered so that they react to the light			2
that was made possible by the amazing discovery of a kind of protein that can be used to turn neurons on and off in response to light			1
the exotic light - sensitive protein is not present in normal neurons , so scientists designed a way to insert it			2
that is accomplished through a type of gene engineering called " transfection " that employs " vectors " such as viruses to infect the target neuron , and , once there , to insert genetic material that will cause the neuron to manufacture the light - sensitive protein			0
put it all together , and you have that sci - fi - sounding technology : genetically - engineered neurons that you can turn on and off at will , inside the brain of a living and freely - moving animal			1
it is the combined use of optics and genetics that give optogenetics its name , but it 's not the " how " that makes optogenetics exciting , it is the " what			2
" scientists did n't really develop it to " take over " a creature 's brain			2
they developed it , like @entity11 , to learn about the brain , and how the brain works , in this case by studying the effect of stimulating specific types of neurons			1
the technology is already beginning to pay off , and despite its recent invention , the word on the street is that a @entity22 is n't far off			2
in one application of optogenetics , scientists investigated how neurons that make dopamine , a neurotransmitter in the brain , may give rise to feelings of reward and pleasure			1
that work may help scientists understand the pleasure - related pathologies involved in clinical depression			0
in another application , scientists selectively stimulated brain cells in animal models of @entity144 , a disease that involves the disruption of information - processing in the brain			0
that research gave new insight into the circuitry involved in the disease , and the way that the therapies we currently prescribe for it operate			0
it has also suggested new directions for therapeutic intervention			0
schizophrenia is another disorder that involves information processing issues in the brain			0
the illusion of hearing voices , for example , may arise from the failure of an internal mechanism for notifying a person when his or her thoughts are " self - generated			0
" @entity58 has been employed to better understand a kind of brain activity called " gamma oscillations " that appear abnormal in schizophrenia -- and also in autism			1
today , we are a long way from the era when a single person working with an assistant or two can make a revolutionary technological breakthrough			0
it took , instead , decades of work in many fields , which came together , only very recently , to bring @entity21 's vision to fruition			0
but now that it 's here , optogenetics is destined to change the way we treat mental illness , and eventually , even , the way we understand ourselves as human beings			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			1

@entity194 : in 2013 , " optogenetics " is the technology to watch out for
@entity194 : imagine being able to turn neurons in a brain on and off from the outside
he says optogenetics can be used to gain insights on diseases , mental illnesses
@entity194 : it will change the way we understand ourselves as human beings
