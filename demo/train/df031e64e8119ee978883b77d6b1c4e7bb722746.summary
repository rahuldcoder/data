@entity26 assistant commissioner @entity25 said officers had seen no additional evidence since its last investigation			0

" thursday 's revelations in the @entity24 come from a case last year in which @entity63 , the head of the @entity64 , was suing the @entity14 for illegally intercepting messages on his cell phone			1
the tabloid paid @entity63 more than Â£ 400,000 ( $ 800,000 at the time ) to settle the case , the @entity24 said			2
the case file was sealed , but the newspaper said it obtained the suppressed evidence			0
that evidence , the @entity24 said , shows that journalists working for the @entity14 paid private investigators to illegally hack the cell phones of several thousand public figures			1
the staff then paid for the information the investigators obtained , the @entity24 said			1
@entity82 , the parent company of the @entity14 defended its journalists and said it would not " shirk from vigorously defending our right and proper role to expose wrongdoing			2
" in a statement @entity82 , the @entity4 subsidiary of @entity86 , said it was prevented by " confidentiality obligations from discussing certain allegations made in the @entity24 newspaper today			1
" but the statement stressed its staff have been told they must operate within the law and the industry 's code of conduct			2
police and prosecutors also came under scrutiny in the @entity24 's report			1
it said the @entity26 were aware of the hackings and raided the offices of some of the private investigators but did not inform those whose phones allegedly were targeted			0
the paper also said prosecutors decided not to take any legal action over the claims			0
@entity37 demanded to know why -- if those allegations are true -- he was n't told that his phone had been allegedly been hacked			2
" i am writing to the chief of police to ask him and the @entity26 authorities , did you know that many of our phones were being tapped ? did you tell the public prosecutor ? did the prosecutor then say ' no further action ' ? " @entity37 told the @entity52			1
" i ca n't believe that such legal authorities -- on such serious charges , if these allegations are right -- did nothing , and i want to know from them			0
" a spokeswoman for @entity46 said the actor was not commenting on the @entity24 's report			2
other celebrities contacted by @entity2 had no immediate comment			0
a spokesman for @entity49 said the union was writing to the commissioner of the @entity26 to ask for evidence accompanying the claims			0
the @entity24 reported that @entity49 was targeted as a way to get actors ' addresses			0
" we have no evidence to support the claims in today 's @entity24 story that @entity49 was conned into giving out information and we have received no complaints from any of our members that the details we hold on their behalf have been improperly accessed , " @entity49 's letter states			2
" we do , however , take the claims very seriously			0
we will be investigating the alleged breach in our security			0
