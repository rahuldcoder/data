-- nearly a year after the presidential election , the excitement of @entity3 's campaign has faded into the reality of an @entity3 @entity6			1
as observers try to determine what time it is in @entity12 politics , they arrive at opposite conclusions			0
to some , said @entity15 political scientist @entity14 , @entity3 is like @entity16 , and the nation will soon hammer the nails into the coffin of a dying @entity21 coalition just as voters , tired of the @entity23 , handed the @entity6 to @entity24 in 1980			1
to others , @entity3 has come to usher in a new understanding of the relationship between the government and the people			2
to them , @entity14 said , it 's the dawning of a new age , as depicted in a famous 1984 @entity34 campaign ad that declared , " it 's morning again in @entity12			1
" both @entity3 and @entity16 were elected into office at a time when voters were hungry for change			1
@entity16 represented the antithesis of president @entity40 and a break from the disillusionment and mistrust of government caused by the @entity45			2
@entity16 , like @entity3 , learned the ropes in a state senate			1
critics accused @entity16 of being inexperienced , having served one term as the governor of @entity51			2
but the @entity21 candidate presented himself as a politician outside of politics and a reformer uninterested in partisan games			0
" with @entity16 himself , there was a sense of a kind of national renewal in some ways that people have said has been true after the very difficult years of the @entity69 presidency , " said @entity57 , chair of the @entity59 's @entity58 at the @entity60			1
shortly after taking office , @entity16 's approval rating peaked at 75 percent but dropped to the low 40s in a little more than a year			1
he entered office weighed down by a sagging economy , and eventually , the energy crisis , the @entity77 's invasion of @entity78 and the @entity80 hostage crisis took a toll on his administration			0
" he ended his presidency , of course , holed up in the @entity6 as a virtual captive himself of the @entity80 hostage takers , " @entity14 said			0
the parallels to @entity16 come primarily from @entity3 's @entity24 critics			1
@entity90 gov. @entity89 speculated last month that a @entity96 loss " may happen again , " and former house speaker @entity91 has predicted that a @entity24 resurgence -- like the one he led in the mid ' 90s -- could be just around the corner			0
" @entity16 is held up as the model of the ineffectual president -- a saint of a man but an ineffectual president			2
and so when people compare @entity3 to @entity16 , that is an attack , " said @entity102 , a senior political analyst for @entity0 who also worked in the @entity40 , @entity104 , @entity34 and @entity105 administrations			1
the comparison to @entity16 , @entity102 said , is more of a danger sign for @entity3 than it is a reality because it shows how the storyline has changed			1
when @entity3 first came into office , observers likened him to some of the most successful presidents in @entity12 history , such as @entity116 , @entity102 said			1
now , @entity3 's also being compared to a president who did n't live up to expectations			1
the @entity16 comparison shows how much polarization has occurred in the country since the election , @entity102 said			1
under @entity16 , there was also a sense of polarization -- but it was in the president 's party			2
the liberal wing of the @entity21 felt abandoned to the point that sen. @entity130 , one of the top liberals in @entity132 , challenged @entity16 in his 1980 re-election bid			2
@entity130 came up short , but his bid severely weakened @entity16 and contributed to his eventual defeat in the 1980 election to @entity34 , @entity57 said			1
while the similarities are not lost on @entity57 , what 's more telling is the " most important mistake that [ @entity3 ] did n't make			2
" when @entity16 took office , there were @entity21 with executive branch experience available , but he did n't want to use them			2
" @entity16 was criticized for bringing in the ' @entity147 , ' " @entity57 said , referring to @entity16 's decision to give key positions to people from his home state			2
@entity3 , however , stacked his bench with pros from the @entity105 administration			2
he brought in some advisers from @entity152 , @entity153 , some from @entity155 and others such as chief of staff @entity157 with deep ties to both places			0
that move was critical , @entity57 said , " because if you 've got seasoned people in these positions , they 're much more likely to make adjustments and to know @entity166 in a way that will allow them to weather the kinds of problems that were common to both @entity16 and @entity3			1
" @entity171 , a @entity172 political scientist , said the comparisons to @entity16 are weak			2
" @entity16 is a very rare exception in @entity12 history			2
most first - term presidents get a second term , " he said , adding that it 's especially rare since @entity16 's term came on the heels of previous @entity24 rule			1
president @entity69 also served one term , but it came after eight years of @entity24 control of the @entity6			0
the more analogous comparison so far , @entity171 said , is to @entity34 , who also entered the @entity6 with a full plate of foreign policy problems -- mostly surrounding the @entity187 -- and a major economic crisis at hand			1
@entity34 was a gifted politician , @entity171 said			0
he was known as an inspiring communicator , and his appeal crossed party lines			0
like @entity3 , polls showed that @entity34 was more popular than his policies			1
more than 20 years after he left the @entity6 , @entity24 still look to him as the last great face of the party			0
" @entity34 continues to be the touchstone , the smiling @entity199 figure			0
everybody rubs his belly for good luck , " @entity14 said			0
" like the smiling @entity199 , he is whatever you want him to be			0
" in his book " @entity205 , " @entity3 wrote that although he and @entity34 had differing political viewpoints , he understands the @entity24 president 's appeal			1
" @entity34 spoke to @entity12 's longing for order , our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind , impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies , so long as we rediscover the traditional values of hard work , patriotism , personal responsibility , optimism , and faith , " he wrote			2
@entity102 , who was director of communications for @entity34 , said the comparisons to @entity34 are strained because of their opposite governing styles			1
where as @entity3 tries to draw consensus , @entity34 drew lines , he said			1
" @entity34 was a conviction politician , and @entity3 is a consensus - seeking politician , " @entity102 said			1
" @entity3 was a magical figure in his campaign , ran an extremely good campaign , but also based it more on the sense of hope and change as ideas , the particular policy solutions , Ã  la @entity34			1
" @entity234 , an economic policy adviser to @entity34 , said @entity3 and @entity34 faced similar problems in their first year but approached them with different solutions			1
faced with an economic crisis , @entity34 's strategy was to reduce taxes , let the @entity12 people figure out what to do and then find out what went wrong , @entity234 said			1
after @entity34 cut taxes in his first year , there were no immediate changes			0
" it looked terrible , and it did n't look very good during the second year			0
and then it began to catch and it worked ... and it was really terrific on the third and the fourth and the fifth and so on , " @entity234 said			0
as for @entity3 's approach to country 's economic woes -- it 's too early to tell what will happen , he said			1
in his first few months in office , @entity34 also went through a game - changing experience that had ramifications for both him and the country : he got shot			0
" he came very close to dying			0
it was right down next to his heart			0
just stunned everything , stunned everybody , " @entity234 recalled			0
but within weeks , @entity34 was back at work -- with a positive attitude and good sense of humor			0
" and the @entity21 -- after he came to life again -- they took a deep sigh and said , ' ok , you can do whatever you want , ' " @entity234 said			0
as tragic as the 1981 assassination attempt was , @entity34 's quick recovery -- and the sympathy from @entity21 -- provided momentum for the president 's agenda			2
" the first year is a very tough year for any president , " @entity234 said , noting that each year thereafter is " dramatically different			0
" asked what he thinks about comparisons to @entity16 and @entity34 , @entity234 replied , " you know who he looks like ? @entity3			1
" looking to administrations past , @entity3 can learn a valuable lesson , @entity102 said			1
" do n't spend time wallowing in arguments about who you might be -- spend time worrying about who you are and worrying about governing			0
" the similarities between @entity3 and his predecessors , while interesting to discuss , are not foreboding , @entity57 said			0
" there is no exact historical parallel to what we are looking at right now			0
there are bits and pieces here and there , " he said			0
it 's impossible , however to take those similarities and " piece out from them a guaranteed scenario that he is going to end up in the same place			0
" that idea , he said , is perhaps best summed up in a quote attributed to @entity311 : " history does n't repeat itself , it rhymes			0

presidents @entity3 , @entity16 both elected at a time when voters wanted change
analyst : @entity16 comparison shows how expectations have changed since @entity3 's win
@entity3 , @entity34 faced similar problems but approached them differently , @entity34 aide says
@entity3 should worry about who he is , not who he might be , analyst @entity102 says
