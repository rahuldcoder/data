-- @entity4 coo @entity3 's latest headline - making action is a new " @entity7 " campaign , which aims at getting rid of the word " bossy			1
" her nonprofit group , @entity9 , has even teamed up with big names like @entity11 and @entity12 to produce a public service announcement to stop using the word " bossy			1
" in a weekend op - ed for the @entity15 , co-written with @entity17 ceo @entity16 , @entity3 put the word at the center of the problem of unequal treatment of girls and boys , noting that girls who lead are more often described as " bossy " and " overly ambitious " while boys who lead are described as " strong " and " determined			1
" @entity3 raises valid points , and as a powerful woman her voice adds much to the ongoing conversation about why it 's important to insist on equal treatment of , and expectations for , boys and girls , and men and women			1
but while @entity3 is n't wrong that " bossy " is disproportionately directed at girls and women , and usually with negative connotations , the problem is n't the word itself , but how and when the word is used			1
@entity45 " bossy " and other words will spring up in its place : " @entity48 , " " cold " and " aggressive " come to mind			1
instead , the focus should be on how to reclaim the positive and indispensable nature of " bossiness , " turning it from a word used to describe the domineering and unlikable to one used to describe those very necessary qualities for those who lead			2
@entity3 is bossy , and it 's a quality that likely played a pretty key role in helping her become one of the technology industry 's most successful women			1
so , how about an initiative to reclaim bossiness as a point of pride ? bosses are bossy , plain and simple			2
as @entity3 even notes : " ... if you look at my childhood , if you look at the childhood of most of the leaders we talked to , they lived through being told they were bossy			1
" and , well , look where they are now			0
in fact , moving to abolish the word " bossy " risks sending the message that there 's something wrong with those characteristics associated with bossiness : taking charge and speaking your mind			2
again , the problem is n't the word , or the behavior , but the reaction to the behavior , and the acceptance among women of the word as a disparaging one			0
there 's also the very important fact that by focusing on how to foster those girls who , like @entity3 , grow up inclined to lead rather than follow — to boss — a message emerges that leadership is the only road to success			2
and that 's just not true			0
initiatives are commendable , as is any opening of dialogue			0
but it 's hard not to interpret " @entity7 " as a reaction to the tepid response @entity3 received to her last initiative , " @entity109 , " through which she was criticized as being too privileged to be a valid motivator			1
with " @entity7 , " she certainly makes an effort to position herself as among the downtrodden , one among many who 've been victimized by " the other b - word			1
" but there 's some overreaching going on here			0
let 's not forget : there is evidence that girls and women are n't in fact being overlooked , or discouraged into meekness			0
girls are outperforming boys in schools			0
more women than men are graduating college and going on to earn as much , if not more , than their male partners			0
@entity132 's latest ranking of @entity134 's 500 largest corporations includes more female ceos than ever			0
things are n't perfect , of course , but they 're getting there , as women — and men — embrace not only their bossiness , but all those other qualities that lead them to live lives that are fulfilling in any number of ways			2
the lesson to children , and to the parents and teachers who raise and nurture them , should be that there is pride in being opinionated , motivated and motivating — that is , bossy			1
there is also pride in being not - so - bossy , and in recognizing whatever other specific traits make them special , whether they go on to become leaders or not			0
there 's a word to describe that , too : individuality			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			0

@entity4 coo @entity3 is *launching* a " @entity7 " campaign
@entity163 : abolishing the word is *pointless* ; other words will take its place
she says *banning* the word seems to say bossy qualities are bad when they 're not
@entity163 : there is pride in being opinionated and motivated -- that is to say , bossy
