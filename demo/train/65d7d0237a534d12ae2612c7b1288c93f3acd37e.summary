with names like @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 under its belt , it 's little wonder @entity7 has earned a reputation as one of the fashion capitals of the world			0
if " @entity24 chic " has become synonymous with the elegance , grace and style of its country 's powerhouse fashion labels and catwalk shows , this weekend that glamor will be out in force on a very different type of track -- the @entity22			1
your average horse race this is not			0
while @entity31 's @entity30 often displays images of tango - colored ladies kicking off their heels , their @entity24 counterparts take a distinctly more demure approach to a day at the races			1
" @entity24 dressing is less spectacular than @entity30 , it 's less extroverted , " @entity22 spokesman @entity37 said			1
" the @entity24 style is very classic			1
it 's about elegance , beauty and glamor			1
" such was the clampdown on decorum at this year 's @entity30 , organizers went to the extent of publishing style guides for race - goers			1
ladies were advised that all dresses were to be of " modest " length -- defined as " falling just above the knee or longer			0
" shorts and shoulderless dresses were also deemed a non- no. while @entity7 race - goers adhere to a more classic style , one fashion accessory appears universal -- the obligatory outrageous hat			2
" the hat is an essential element of the @entity22 , " says @entity37			2
" it started in the 1920s as a way to convey some eccentricity , to do some showing - off			0
today that might mean a hat with the @entity68 on top			0
" set on the picturesque @entity70 in @entity7 , " the @entity22 , " as it is known , prides itself on being @entity73 's most prestigious -- and richest -- horse race			1
with almost € 8 million ( $ 10.4 million ) in prize money on offer over the weekend , the @entity74 and @entity76 - sponsored event attracts an elite clientele of royalty , world leaders and business heavyweights			2
each year the grandstands fill with the " @entity84 " of @entity73 society , with @entity87 's @entity86 , the daughter of princess @entity88 , and @entity90 model @entity89 some of the glamorous guests in 2011			1
for the super rich wanting to beat the crowds , a helicopter flying from @entity93 to @entity94 in @entity7 will take around one hour and 45 minutes -- and set you back a whopping £ 5,480 ( $ 8,874 )			0
that 's not to mention the 15 - minute car hire from @entity94 to @entity70 costing another £ 200 ( $ 323 )			0
the @entity22 's slogan : " @entity102 une course , c'est un monument " -- " not so much a race as a monument , " points to the grand imagery surrounding this uniquely @entity24 event			1
founded in 1920 , the @entity22 was named after the very monument built in honor of @entity24 allied forces during @entity111			1
this year will mark the 91st @entity22 , which has only been canceled twice in its illustrious history -- in 1939 and 1940 during @entity113			2
yet despite this emphasis on prestige , the @entity22 also remains one of @entity73 's most accessible races for the average punter , with general admission to sunday 's headline event costing just € 8 ( $ 10.4 )			1
a ticket to @entity30 's grandstand , meanwhile , will cost you £ 75 ( $ 121 )			1
@entity22 organizers are preparing for a huge @entity126 contingent this year , as horse @entity127 aims to deliver the country 's first win at @entity70			2
the @entity126 triple crown winner had been a co-favorite to win the race alongside @entity136 winner @entity134			0
but its chances now look unlikely after drawing the far outside stall 18 , where just one horse has won in the 92 - year history of the race			0
nonetheless there will still be @entity126 - speaking stewards at betting desks to assist the large numbers of @entity148 punters expected			0
it may be known as " @entity150 , " but come sunday the @entity22 may also be referred to as the " @entity151 " if @entity153 winner @entity152 takes the crown			0
bought by a prosperous baker for just € 10,000 ( $ 13,056 ) as a yearling , @entity152 is now the other favorite to win the race after drawing the plumb stall of two			0
whatever the outcome , one thing is for sure , the @entity24 crowd will be celebrating in style .			2

think " @entity24 chic " and the words elegance , style and grace *spring* to mind
that glamor will be on display at this weekend 's @entity22
@entity175 contrast to @entity31 's @entity30 , which has a more *flamboyant* style
prestigious race *regularly* attracts the " @entity179 " of @entity73 society
