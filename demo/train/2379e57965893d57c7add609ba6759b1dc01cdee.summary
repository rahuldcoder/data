-- @entity0 's story about @entity2 touched readers and viewers , many of whom wrote to say they felt some responsibility for the @entity9 girl whose life was saved by @entity11 at the height of the @entity13			1
others simply wanted to know how they could help			0
@entity15 , the @entity17 - based @entity16 charity that sponsored her stay in the @entity11 in 2006 , said it was setting up a special @entity20 so it could channel donations specifically to @entity2 's family			1
@entity2 was born with a severe form of spina bifida			1
@entity25 , the executive director of @entity15 , said thursday the charity set up the fund after being contacted by people who saw the @entity0 story			1
she said she was not yet sure exactly how the donations would be used and that the charity was still determining what the right action would be			0
she said it would look into possibly linking @entity2 's family with specialists in @entity34 or shipping medical supplies to them			1
" we are keeping a separate account for her , " @entity25 said			2
" i do know that we will do the right thing			0
i am 100 % sure of that			0
" anyone who wants to donate should include the words " @entity20 " in the box that reads " who should we notify of this gift " on @entity15 's @entity48			1
one @entity0 reader with spina bifida wished the @entity9 girl well			0
" as someone born with a mild case of spina bifida , i 've faced certain physical challenges throughout my life -- i 'm 49 -- but nothing like this young @entity9 girl , " wrote @entity57			2
" may @entity60 grant her continued life , improving health and a happy heart			2
" another reader , @entity64 , wrote : " we humans possess the power to turn our world into garden or wasteland			0
... so she was given hope by noble soldiers who still believe that they are warriors and not mercenaries			0
( the ) journalist that was trying to make the difference instead of chasing some celebrity			0
doctors , members of ( a ) charity group and host families who showed this child the best we humans can offer -- compassion			2
and then she was forgotten , received the worst we humans can offer -- indifference			0
" @entity2 , now 7 , was discovered by @entity11 soldiers when she was 3 months old during a routine raid of her house just before christmas 2005			1
@entity2 's grandmother told the soldiers that @entity9 doctors could do nothing for @entity2 , who was born with vertebrae that did not form completely around her spinal cord			1
she was certain to die			0
the soldiers sent her to the @entity11 , where doctors performed life - saving surgery			1
after six months , she was returned to her home in the town of @entity106			0
another reader , @entity107 , thought @entity2 should not have been sent back to @entity13			2
" when her family asked for help , they probably thought that more could be done for her in @entity11 than was possible , and they somehow imagined that she would be returned to them in good health , " @entity107 said			1
" if it was just that she lacked the use of her legs , it would n't be so bad , but when it involves her bowels and bladder as well , that is just beyond what any poor family could possibly handle			2
if she were in the @entity11 and possibly in a home for disabled persons , she might have more quality of life , and her family ( would ) have the huge burden of her care removed from them , and she might have actual nurses who would care for her			1
" @entity2 's family paid a price for the association with @entity11			1
they were threatened and forced to restart life in a new neighborhood			0
@entity0 caught up with them a few weeks ago in @entity34 and published @entity2 's story on tuesday , the 10th anniversary of the @entity13			1
it evoked all sorts of emotions and comments about the war itself and what @entity11 's role ought to be in that part of the world			1
@entity2 's family is struggling to make sure the little girl gets the proper care she needs for her complex medical issues			1
@entity2 has a shunt in her brain to relieve pressure from fluid buildup , and she often experiences urinary tract infections that could possibly lead to renal failure			2
she also has no feeling in her pelvis and her legs , and she can not walk			0
some of @entity2 's family members wondered whether @entity11 had forgotten them			1
a question that naturally arose from the story was whether @entity11 owed anything to @entity2			1
many agreed that @entity11 ought to help			2
" the article speaks to the idea that many people are happy to help for a time , but it 's easy to forget once the headlines go away , " said @entity168			0
" the follow - up years later presents the question of whether people who step up to assist have a duty to follow through and , if so , for how long ? if we start to help , how far should we go ? is it the right thing to separate the child from her family ? these are all serious questions with no right or wrong answer , but we should each consider them carefully			1
whatever our answer is , it tells us something about ourselves and the world in which we live , " she said			0
but others , like @entity193 said this : " right now she is just a @entity195 girl with a bladder problem , no different from millions of others			0
now the help should be directed to the people who need it most now , and i am sorry to tell you , that is probably not her			0
" @entity168 acknowledged that @entity2 's case was a tough one			2
@entity168 likes happy endings ; she wants everyone to be in a safe place and lead a life of quality			0
she knows that 's easy to say but in this case , difficult to accomplish .			0
