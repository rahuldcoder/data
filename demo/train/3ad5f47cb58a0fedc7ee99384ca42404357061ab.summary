-- @entity2 researchers reported a breakthrough thursday in the search for a vaccine for malaria , the mosquito - borne disease that sickens millions worldwide			1
more than three dozen volunteers received multiple , intravenous doses of a vaccine produced with a weakened form of the disease , scientists from the @entity9 , the @entity10 , @entity11 and other organizations reported thursday			1
though the results were promising , more extensive field testing will be required , the researchers wrote			0
nevertheless , the it marks the first time any vaccine trial has shown 100 % success in protecting subjects from the mosquito - borne tropical disease , which sickens more than 200 million a year and killed about 660,000 in 2010			1
dr. @entity27 , head of the preventive medicine department at @entity30 's medical school , called the results " a scientific advance " -- but cautioned that it 's " not ready yet for prime time			0
" study : malaria - infected mosquitoes more attracted to human odor " this is not a vaccine that 's ready for travelers to the developing world anytime soon , " @entity27 told @entity0			1
" however , from the point of view of science dealing with one of the big - three infectious causes of death around the world , it 's a notable advance			2
and everybody will be holding their breath , watching to see whether this next trial works and how well it works			0
" the findings were published thursday by the peer - reviewed journal @entity53			2
the trials involved 57 subjects , including 40 who received the vaccine , from october 2011 to october 2012			2
students invent award - winning soap to tackle malaria the vaccine being tested was produced by @entity63 company @entity62 and tested by the @entity64 , the @entity65 and the @entity66			1
@entity67 owns the patent , said capt. @entity69 , the lead researcher for the @entity66			0
@entity27 said the process of getting the vaccine scientifically proven , approved and distributed could take eight to 10 years			2
@entity67 and @entity69 said they believe the process could be complete within three to four			0
the vaccine was produced using samples of @entity76 , the single - celled parasite that causes the disease			1
the samples were weakened by radiation and then frozen			0
the vaccine was " safe and well - tolerated " by the volunteers who received it , the study states			1
@entity27 , who was not part of the study , said previous attempts using injections into skin or muscle did n't work			2
multiple , intravenous injections are " a heck of a way " to administer a vaccine , but " desperate times call for desperate measures , " he said			1
researchers reported that the six volunteers who received five intravenous doses of the vaccine did not contract malaria when exposed to the microscopic parasite			1
of the nine who received four doses , three contracted the disease			0
of 12 who received no vaccine , 11 became infected			2
dr. @entity108 , the head of the infectious disease institute , called the results an " important step forward " in preventing malaria			1
" the global burden of malaria is extraordinary and unacceptable , " @entity108 said in a statement issued by the institute			2
" scientists and health care providers have made significant gains in characterizing , treating and preventing malaria ; however , a vaccine has remained an elusive goal			1
" another possible vaccine , backed by the @entity122 , cut the number of malaria cases in half during a trial conducted among children in seven @entity129 countries			1
in a statement thursday afternoon , @entity130 , a senior program officer for the foundation , said thursday 's published results were promising despite the study 's small number of participants			2
" the results provide further confirmation that a malaria vaccine is feasible , though this specific construct has hurdles to overcome , " @entity137 said			1
" more evidence will be required to demonstrate that it could work among people living in malaria - endemic countries			1
it 's also likely that a number of manufacturing and presentation challenges would need to be addressed to ensure that the vaccine could be produced and delivered at scale			2
" currently , available drugs can stave off malaria , but must be combined with other protective measures such as insect repellent or nets , according to the @entity158			0
none are 100 % effective , the @entity158 notes			0
@entity27 said future studies need to involve larger groups in field conditions and examinations of how long the vaccines stave off infection			0
using multiple intravenous doses -- a process unlike any other vaccine -- " requires a great deal of aseptic practice and good training , " and the risk of infection is a possibility , he said			1
" we do n't know how long this protection lasts yet			0
but that should not diminish the fact that this is a scientific advance , " @entity27 said			0
@entity181 says ' no more ' to malaria malaria causes fever and vomiting and can disrupt the blood supply to vital organs if untreated			0
symptoms show up 10 to 15 days after being bitten by a mosquito			0
it 's endemic to tropical countries , and the microscopic parasite has become resistant to a number of treatments , according to the @entity194			0
with no effective vaccine , efforts to control the disease have focused on mosquito control and distributing pesticide - laced nets			1
people visiting the tropics from countries where the disease is not endemic are particularly vulnerable , the @entity194 says			0
@entity2 troops overseas have suffered extensively from malaria in the past			1
the @entity11 reported 500,000 cases during @entity208 , with more than 100,000 among the @entity10 and @entity209			0
@entity0 's @entity210 contributed to this report .			0

@entity122 says tested vaccine " has hurdles to overcome "
@entity2 malaria study finds success with intravenous vaccine
@entity9 official hails test as an " important step forward "
malaria sickens an *estimated* 200 - million plus every year , killing about 1 million
