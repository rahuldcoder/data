@entity0 -- by wading into the issue of an @entity5 center and mosque near ground zero , president @entity2 provided @entity8 with an emotion - ridden attack vehicle while diverting attention from campaign themes of fellow @entity12			1
a senior @entity8 strategist told @entity1 that @entity8 candidates are being encouraged to talk about the issue as much as possible			1
in @entity17 , @entity8 gubernatorial candidate @entity16 launched a statewide television ad monday criticizing @entity2 for backing the right of @entity20 to build an @entity5 center and mosque two blocks from where the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks killed more than 2,700 people			1
" @entity2 says building a mosque at ground zero is about tolerance , " @entity16 says in the ad , looking directly into the camera			1
" the " truth , " @entity16 claims , is this : " @entity5 fanatics murdered thousands of innocent @entity37 on 9/11 , just yards from the proposed mosque			2
" " the fight against terrorism is n't over , " @entity16 concludes			0
" mr. president , ground zero is the wrong place for a mosque			1
" meanwhile , a @entity46 @entity12 leadership aide said the issue was dominating the political conversation when @entity12 need to stress campaign themes such as economic recovery and saving social security			1
" we understand why the president would want to talk about this issue , but the timing could n't have been any worse , " the @entity46 @entity12 leadership aide told @entity1			1
despite the concerns of @entity12 , senate majority leader @entity57 of @entity58 on monday came out against building the @entity5 center and mosque			1
" @entity62 protects freedom of religion			0
sen. @entity57 respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built some place else , " said a statement issued by @entity57 's spokesman , @entity65			1
@entity57 is involved in a tough re-election campaign against conservative @entity8 @entity70			1
the statement on the ground zero issue also called for @entity8 to back a @entity12 bill that would provide health care aid and compensation for firefighters , police officers and other first responders to the 9/11 attacks			1
for its part , the @entity46 sought to tamp down the discussion monday			0
speaking to reporters , @entity46 spokesman @entity82 sidestepped a question on @entity8 strategy and tried to declare the debate over			1
" the president did n't do this because of the politics , " @entity82 said , adding : " i think that it 's a debate that was had and we 've weighed in			2
" on sunday , the topic dominated morning talk shows , with @entity8 calling @entity2 insensitive for supporting the right of @entity20 to build the @entity5 center so close to ground zero			1
some predicted political repercussions for @entity12 in november 's congressional election , even though they agreed with @entity2 that freedom of religion is a vital part of @entity37 democracy			1
" the @entity20 have , as everyone else does , the right to practice their religion and they have the right to construct a mosque at ground zero if they wish , " rep. @entity103 , @entity105 - @entity104 , said on @entity1 's " @entity107 " program			1
" what i 'm saying , though , is they should listen to public opinion , they should listen to the deep wounds and anguish this is causing to so many good people			0
" @entity8 strategist @entity121 , a senior political contributor to @entity1 , summed up the @entity8 perspective			2
" intellectually , the president may be right , but this is an emotional issue , and people who lost kids , brothers , sisters , fathers , what have you , do not want that mosque in @entity104 , and it 's going to be a big , big issue for @entity12 across this country , " @entity121 said on the @entity133 program " @entity126			1
" on the same program , @entity141 chairman @entity140 challenged the @entity8 logic			2
" you know , we see an awful lot of republicans going out and saying we 've got to respect the @entity148 , and that means we have to respect it , " @entity140 said			2
" we ca n't tarnish people 's first amendment rights			2
" @entity12 gov. @entity153 of @entity154 said on the @entity133 program that the @entity5 center issue should n't have political resonance			1
" i ca n't imagine that any @entity37 -- given the challenges facing this country -- is going to vote based on what he said about the mosque , " @entity153 said of the november election			0
" the mosque is an unfortunate situation , but we do have a right to practice our religion freely wherever we choose			0
rights are not subject to the popular vote or majority vote			0
" in his speech at a @entity46 dinner friday marking the start of the @entity5 holy month of @entity175 , @entity2 said @entity20 " have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country			2
" " that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower @entity188 , in accordance with local laws and ordinances , " the president added			0
the next day , @entity2 told @entity1 chief @entity46 correspondent @entity192 that he was " not commenting on the wisdom " of the project , just the broader principle that the government should treat " everyone equal , regardless " of religion			1
his comments were considered by some to backtrack from what he said at the dinner , prompting a @entity46 spokesman to further clarify the president 's remarks later saturday			0
both the topic and @entity207 to clarify his initial remarks evoked criticism from @entity8			2
sen. @entity210 , @entity211 , told " @entity217 " that @entity2 's stance demonstrated how " @entity0 , the @entity46 , the administration , the president himself seems to be disconnected from the mainstream of @entity37			1
" " this is sort of the dichotomy that people sense , that they 're being lectured to -- not listened to -- and i think that 's the reason why a lot of people are very upset with @entity0 , " @entity210 said			0
on the @entity1 program , @entity103 said @entity2 's lack of clarity further muddied the issue			1
" if the president was going to get into this , he should have been much more clear , much more precise , and you ca n't be changing your position from day to day on an issue which does go to our @entity148 , and it also goes to extreme sensitivity , " @entity103 said			0
democrats responded that critics fail to distinguish between the @entity240 terrorists who carried out the 9/11 attacks and the @entity5 religion , which includes peaceful adherents all over the world , including the @entity37			0
" it is only insensitive if you regard @entity5 as the culprit as opposed to @entity240 as the culprit , " rep. @entity245 , @entity246 - @entity104 , said on the @entity1 program			0
" we were not attacked by all @entity20			0
there were @entity20 killed there			0
there were @entity20 who ran in as first responders to help			0
" the issue was one of personal rights , not political popularity , @entity245 said , adding : " we do not put the @entity260 , we do not put the religious freedom to a vote			0
" the @entity46 @entity12 leadership aide lamented that the topic was getting so much attention			2
" we were supposed to be talking about @entity271 in this coming week , " the aide said , referring to @entity12 criticism of @entity8 calls to privatize the government - run pension program			1
" this is a really good issue for us			0
and instead , we 're talking about the mosque			2
" @entity2 's remarks friday drew praise from @entity104 mayor @entity276 , who announced his support for the @entity5 center last week			1
@entity279 compared @entity2 's speech to a letter former president @entity282 wrote more than two centuries ago in support of a @entity285 congregation in @entity286 , @entity287			1
in the speech , @entity2 called the 9/11 attacks " a deeply traumatic event for our country			2
" " the pain and suffering experienced by those who lost loved ones is unimaginable , " @entity2 continued			2
" so i understand the emotions that this issue engenders			0
ground zero is , indeed , hallowed ground			0
