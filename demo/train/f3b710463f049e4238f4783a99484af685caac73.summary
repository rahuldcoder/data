-- it 's become an increasingly precious jewel in the @entity4 's financial crown , attracting big crowds and treating the leading players like rock stars since its move to @entity10 four years ago			1
this week 's @entity11 not only showcases the top 16 singles and doubles competitors , it also highlights the benefits the men 's tennis showpiece can bring to a city			1
the question now is , can the @entity20 capital continue its love affair with the tournament -- or will it continue its nomadic past ? before @entity10 was granted an extension to stage it until 2015 , @entity24 and @entity25 were other cities rumored to be in the running			1
the @entity29 , like @entity10 , is one of the globe 's major metropolises and home to one of tennis ' four grand slams			1
it hosted the @entity4 tournament in the late ' 70s and ' 80s in the heyday of @entity41			1
@entity42 , meanwhile , is an emerging market that in the next three years will host soccer 's @entity44 , the @entity46 and a medium - sized tennis event in @entity25			1
however , moving the event elsewhere would be a " gamble , " according to the former head of the @entity4 's commercial division , while @entity49 -- whose record six finals wins are spread across @entity10 , @entity51 and @entity52 -- would have no issue with a further continuation			1
tournament director @entity58 says staying in @entity20 past 2015 is " definitely " a possibility			2
unlike soccer 's ruling body @entity61 , which aims to take the @entity44 to pastures new , the @entity4 's goal is n't to be " evangelistic " about tennis -- and @entity10 , with its packed crowds , has been a boon financially for the men 's game			1
" my personality is n't much for a change , " @entity58 , a @entity42 , told @entity0			0
" this is a different animal to the @entity44 in that it 's year to year , and you do want to expose fans around the world to this type of tennis			2
" but the tournament is a very important part of the business of the @entity4			1
more important than exposing everyone around the world to it is making sure it 's healthy and not an experiment			2
" i know a lot of people talked about @entity25 and @entity24			1
it 's obviously great to be wanted			0
at the same time you need to be sure it makes sense -- and right now @entity10 makes a lot of sense			2
" @entity49 , who lost to @entity94 in last year 's final , shared @entity58 's view			0
" i must agree with @entity58 in many ways because i think it 's important that this event is played in a place that knows tennis , " @entity49 told @entity0			1
" i think it 's good sometimes to play @entity52 , or maybe @entity103 or @entity104 for a year , but i think it 's not long enough in one place to put its roots down			1
" @entity103 welcomed the world 's top players in 2000 and @entity104 did the same in 2001 in another one - year stint			2
" it 's like a circus , " said @entity49 , who will this week tie @entity113 's record of 12 successive appearances at the season - ending event			1
" you come , the tent is there but it 's temporary and you move it away again			0
so here the roots are down , it 's successful and that 's why if the business makes sense , if the numbers make sense , if the excitement of everybody involved makes sense , i think we should keep it here			0
" other options would have to be considered but it would have to be a great other option			0
" @entity137 , the ceo of @entity138 before leaving his post at the end of 2010 , said @entity10 was " twice as successful " in monetary value for the ruling body than other host cities			1
unlike when the season finale was showcased in @entity52 as the @entity11 , the @entity11 are operated as a joint venture between the @entity4 and @entity10 's @entity148 venue owner @entity146			1
all operating costs and revenues feed into the joint venture			0
the @entity52 promoters paid the @entity4 for the right to run the tournament , and the purchasing fee -- believed to work out to about $ 10 million per year -- was all the latter received from the event			1
" if there 's no tennis fatigue at the @entity148 and it 's still selling out , i think you have to ask yourself , ' what 's the upside to move it elsewhere ? ' " said @entity137			2
" at the @entity4 , it 's not their responsibility to be evangelistic about tennis			1
" @entity10 is a great city and that helps corporately			2
you 'd have to take a long , hard look to say , ' we 're going to move it			0
' it 's very profitable and to get a tennis - loving nation behind it in any other country at that time of the year will be a gamble			2
" the success of the tournament has had a knock - on effect on sponsorship , according to both @entity137 and @entity58			2
some companies get involved with the @entity11 and then decide to increase their affiliation with the tour throughout the year			0
more than one million fans have walked through the turnstiles in the four editions , helped by a capacity of 17,800 that makes the @entity148 the second - largest regularly used tennis venue behind @entity24 's @entity187			1
operating two sessions -- day and evening -- pads the coffers			0
tickets to watch a single round - robin match range from Â £ 10 - 62 ( $ 16 - 98 ) , while seats for the final are Â £ 30 - 105 ( $ 48 - 167 )			0
" people want to be part of the event , " said @entity58			0
" they see how successful it is			0
they see the tour operates in a very successful way throughout the year and end up becoming global partners			0
" come the conclusion of 2015 , @entity10 's term will hit seven consecutive seasons , a run only bettered by @entity24 , which had an unbroken spell from 1977 - 1989			1
with tennis a younger sport in @entity211 , crowds for opening matches disappointed , the time zone presented problems for broadcasters and viewers in @entity217 -- tennis ' biggest market -- while players faced the long trip to @entity222 following the @entity217 indoor swing			0
@entity10 lacks those issues , though players have complained about @entity20 's tax laws -- which restrict the number of days they can be in the country before being rated on their overall income			2
the @entity148 is " one of the best venues ever " according to veteran doubles specialist @entity231 , this week teaming up with @entity232			0
" playing in there , the acoustics are phenomenal , " @entity231 , who turned pro in 1991 , told @entity0			0
" the crispness of it makes the quality of tennis so high			0
" pondering the achievement of the event in @entity10 , @entity137 spared a thought for former @entity4 head @entity245			1
@entity246 was criticized for implementing a round - robin format at smaller tournaments , and the @entity4 was taken to court during his 2005 - 08 tenure for attempting to strip a @entity252 event of @entity254 status			2
but @entity246 spearheaded the shift to @entity10 from @entity52 in 2009			1
" people have short memories , " said @entity137			0
" it was a very bold move			0
the @entity148 was n't an established venue and it had a slight miasma about it			0
" to back ourselves and say we know we can build an event here , find sponsors and fill it with an audience really that has just had @entity266 , outdoors ... we 're going to take that tennis - loving public and tell them to watch tennis indoors -- it was a big decision			0

@entity10 will host the season - ending *championship* of men 's tennis until 2015
it first held the @entity11 in 2009 and its contract was extended
the tournament has become an important financial boon for the @entity4
it was *previously* held in @entity52 , with @entity25 and @entity24 also *interested*
