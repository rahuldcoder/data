-- tempestuous weather is striking the @entity2 on four fronts			2
it seems as if @entity5 is trying to throw much of the nation one extreme or another			0
here 's a roundup : first tropical storm of the season ? an area of " disturbed weather " in the @entity13 , off the @entity14 , could bring heavy rain and flooding to the @entity17 and the @entity18 and @entity20 coasts by thursday , @entity0 meteorologist @entity10 said			1
@entity10 says he 'll be watching to see if the bad weather becomes the first tropical depression -- or even the first tropical storm -- of the 2013 @entity25 hurricane season , which runs from june 1 to november 30			1
at a minimum , the storms could cause a lot of rainfall and flooding on the @entity17 , he said			1
fires a 32,000 - acre wildfire is burning some old - growth chaparral that lies in the western tip of the @entity35 in northern @entity36			1
firefighters have brought the @entity38 60 % under control , said @entity40 of the @entity41			0
six homes have been destroyed , but conditions are safe enough to lift evacuation orders and allow people to return to the communities of @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , authorities said			0
higher humidity and lower temperatures should help firefighters , @entity40 said			0
added @entity10 : " they are n't expecting gusty winds in that area , so the conditions should be favorable for the firefighters to gain some ground there , which they have been			2
" in @entity62 , a wildfire is burning nearly uncontrollably in the mountains at @entity64			1
the @entity66 is only 7 % contained and has charred 8,500 acres , authorities said , adding that crews are trying to protect structures in @entity69			0
floods the mighty @entity71 is now at major flood stage in @entity73 , but the worst of it is over and waters will recede this week , @entity10 said			1
the river has risen to more than 10 feet above flood stage			0
@entity81 , however , @entity79 , @entity80 , could face flooding as the surge moves downstream , @entity10 said			0
but the city will be the last along the river to face such a threat , because the river begins to widen south of there , @entity10 said			0
" we 're expecting @entity79 to reach major flood stage tonight and crest at the end of the week , " @entity10 said tuesday			0
crews in @entity94 , @entity80 -- a town just north of @entity73 where the @entity71 and @entity80 rivers meet -- were reinforcing their levees with sandbags			1

@entity108 has reportedly traveled two miles inside the levee			2
@entity110 still reeling from deadly twisters , @entity111 faced a slight risk of thunderstorms tuesday , but the good news is there 's only a slight chance of an isolated tornado , @entity10 said			1
there is , however , a chance of large hail and damaging straight - line winds in northwest @entity111 , he said			2
" for most of the state , it 's just a very slight risk of severe storms , " @entity10 said			2
there is also a slight risk of severe weather for the southern half of @entity130 , far northern @entity131 and southeast @entity132			0
@entity111 's recent storms have killed 19 people , said @entity135 , administrative coordinator for the @entity137 @entity136			1
the tornado that struck @entity140 , @entity111 , on may 31 was declared to be the widest in history , at 2.6 miles , and its damage rating was raised to @entity143 , the most severe , the @entity138 announced tuesday .			2
