-- the @entity1 was a quick - hitting speech that was built to last			1
length : a little over two minutes			2
message : stay the course of a difficult war			0
if @entity8 wo n't work here , it wo n't work anywhere			0
short enough to comfortably fit into a social media status box , and shared in its entirety hundreds of times every day , according to recent data from @entity15			1
memorable phrases are quoted even more often			0
it has been 150 years since president @entity18 got up in front of thousands of people in @entity21 , @entity22 , to dedicate the @entity23 at a turning point in the @entity25			1
his words are some of the most memorable in @entity28 history , forever stamping our collective minds with " four score and seven years ago , " and " all men are created equal , " and of course a " government of the people , by the people , for the people			0
" some of this was n't really his coinage , but we 'll get into that later			0
politicians portrayed themselves differently in @entity18 's day , seeking to give a more powerful kind of impression , said @entity43 , a professor of @entity44 and linguistics at the @entity46 at @entity46			1
" if you did that today , people would think of you as somehow flowery and old - fashioned and ... why are you doing that ? " the modern trend is for leaders to " play the folksy card , " @entity43 said , portraying themselves as ordinary joes and @entity55 who are exactly like you in every way -- except for the fact that they are hoping to achieve a position of immense power			2
@entity43 said the last president with an " oratorial " style -- on the whole -- was probably @entity65 , who was assassinated 100 years and three days after the delivery of the @entity1			1
we still remember @entity65 's delivery of lines like , " ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country			0
" @entity18 was able to get straight to the point and deliver a punchy speech in part because he came after @entity78 's marathon presentation about the war , explains @entity80 , curator of the @entity81 in the @entity82			1
today , most politicians have at least some help preparing their words			0
@entity78 had been the main attraction , but @entity18 's speech started picking up steam afterward and seemed to " go viral " in the manner of its day			1
newspapers wrote about the speech			2
in some cities , people could buy commemorative event pamphlets that contained the speech , and key phrases were incorporated into @entity18 's 1864 election posters and memorials after his death			1
newspaper retracts editorial panning @entity1 sound familiar ? @entity80 said overall , @entity25 - era @entity28 was a consumer - driven society that had a few things in common with our @entity107 - saturated world			1
one can only imagine the tweets that would have been written about such a speech in modern times			1
@entity18 just said in two minutes what @entity114 tried to say in two hours			1
# @entity116 " today , children learn the address in school , especially in @entity121 cities , and documentary guru @entity122 is asking people to record themselves saying the speech from memory			2
@entity122 : learn the @entity1 by heart people also share the quotations on social media			1
certain phrases seem to stick out , and @entity15 numbers show which ones we like to share			0
we found that people in some states , like @entity135 , were particularly fond of quoting the address and that different parts of the speech were more popular in some states than others			1
here is a nonexhaustive rundown of some of the most popular phrases in the speech , in order of appearance			2
' four score and seven years ago ' pretty much everyone knows this part of the @entity1 , even if they think a score is just something from sports			1
but no , in this case a score is 20 of something			0
here , a span of 20 years			0
this line is a bit of an inside remark shared with the audience , believed by most historians to be a reference to @entity165 , which most people of the day would know is an allusion to the human lifespan			1
" the days of our years are threescore years and 10 , " says the psalm			0
" and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years , yet is their strength labor and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away			0
" @entity80 said @entity18 used such phrasing as a subtle reminder that the nation was only a youthful 87 years old			1
@entity18 felt the @entity28 was setting an example for the world , and he did n't want the experiment in democracy to fail			1
" he 's a little bit worried that the nation might die at about the average lifespan that a human would , " @entity80 said			2
" he 's putting forth straightforward political terms in a poetic way			0
" that , and people tend to remember the beginnings of speeches , @entity80 said			0
' all men are created equal ' more clever wordplay is at work in this famous quotation			0
" in his call for democracy and equality , ( @entity18 ) does n't mention slavery , but everyone knew that was what he was talking about , " @entity80 said			1
see what he did there ? this phrase can be interpreted as both an allusion to the principles of the @entity211 and also as a not - so - subtle jab at the institution of slavery			0
little doubt exists that @entity18 opposed slavery , and in fact loathed it , @entity80 said			1
@entity218 was at the heart of the war			0
@entity18 struggled with how to go about eliminating it , and had to be convinced by legal thinkers and abolitionists that he had the governmental power to tackle it			1
' these dead shall not have died in vain ' something about this part of the speech may be touching a nerve somewhere			2
this part was the second - most - mentioned phrase in the entire speech , rivaling " four score and seven years ago " in popularity , despite the fact that it 's not a particularly well - known part of the @entity1			1
but @entity18 ca n't take full credit for this phrase , @entity80 said , because it was a fairly common expression used in the parlance of war			1
it speaks to a need for soldiers ' deaths to mean something , if they must occur -- a timeless desire we echo today			0
how tech preserves the @entity1 " this is always a problem in warfare			1
why should any other people die ? there is always a percentage of the population that will make that argument at a certain point			2
@entity18 's contrary point was that they died defending you			1
they felt so strongly about the right of the cause			0
they felt so strongly about preserving the union and ending slavery that you should not let their efforts carry into the wind			0
you should continue on and further this effort			0
" ' this nation , under @entity273 , shall have a new birth of freedom ' this phrase was mentioned by many readers who commented on this story			2
for some , it has become a point of political contention due to the presence of the words " under @entity273			2
" there are five versions of the speech , and one of them omits those two words			2
@entity291 stands out from the @entity21 crowd another slightly earlier portion of the speech was also frequently cited : " it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us			2
" the takeaway there is persistence in the face of adversity			0
' government of the people , by the people , for the people ' this famous phrase , as well as the few words immediately before and after it , got lots of mentions on @entity15			0
@entity43 pointed out that anything at the end or beginning of a speech is probably automatically more memorable			2
it does n't hurt if a speech is structured to enhance this effect , either			2
it 's such a beloved word grouping that numerous people have borrowed it , massaged it and restated it with a slightly different twist , like a game of telephone in an era without telephones			0
@entity80 said historians trace this part back to @entity325 , a senator and @entity28 secretary of state before the @entity25			1
@entity325 's words were , " the people 's government , made for the people , made by the people and answerable to the people			0
" it was later repurposed by the abolitionist minister @entity333 , who talked about a " government of all the people , by all the people , for all the people			0
" even @entity18 himself is said to have used a version of the phrase in a letter 20 years before the address , @entity80 said			1
@entity80 said the key to the power of this phrase is in its skillful use of repetition			0
the point of " people " is driven straight into your mind by its frequent mention			2
that 's why so many people have recycled it over the years			0
fast - forward to today , and we 're still sharing all the phrases above			0
@entity80 said one can see the endurance of @entity18 's speaking legacy by taking a stroll into the @entity18 library 's gift shop , where you can pick up your very own t - shirt with a @entity18 quotation on it			1
one recently released item has the whole text printed on it			0
@entity18 's speech endures like few others , especially in our everyman - politician era			1
maybe that 's why people ca n't help but post the speech on social media , 150 years after the fact			1
why do you think the @entity1 endures today , and why do some lines seem to resonate more with different places and groups in the @entity28 ? share your thoughts in the comments below .			1
