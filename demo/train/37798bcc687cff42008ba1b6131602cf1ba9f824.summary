@entity0 who want to make a play for the @entity3 by positioning theirs as the party that can govern , in contrast to hapless @entity6 , could face a significant obstacle : their governors			1
from @entity11 to @entity12 to @entity13 , @entity0 governors with their eyes on the @entity3 have presided over unbalanced budgets , unfunded pension liabilities , credit downgrades and sluggish job growth			1
that comes in contrast to an increasingly rosy economic picture nationally , with a strong december jobs report that capped off the best year in terms of economic growth for the nation since 1999			1
unemployment , at 5.8 percent , was below predictions , and job growth has continued for month after month			1
three of the most prominent potential 2016 contenders — @entity11 gov. @entity29 , @entity12 gov. @entity30 and @entity13 gov. @entity31 — could face the most scrutiny , and have the toughest time explaining , their economic records for 2016			1
it 's a troubling prospect for the party as it prepares to offer @entity0 as the " party of solutions " in contrast to the @entity6 , which it says has offered ineffective policies that contributed to a slow recovery and increasing inequality in the nation			1
@entity45 , who chaired sen. @entity47 's 2008 presidential run , said that " the biggest problem the @entity6 will have in the next election is that the economy is bad			1
" related : @entity52 tax cuts on trial amid huge budget deficit " it 's really lack of jobs and lack of economic progress that 's the biggest issue , " he said			1
but reality of late has n't borne that argument out			1
and he admitted that some governors may have some explaining to do			2
" if you 're @entity65 , you have a good story to tell — but some of the others might have a little bit more difficult story to tell			2
but you can always come up with the right spin on it if you work on it , " he said			2
who will have to spin the most ? establishment @entity0 operatives are already quietly whispering over the elephant in the room for @entity11 gov. @entity29 — his state 's economic woes			1
@entity29 came into office pledging replenish the state 's pension program , but had to reverse that promise to help balance the state 's budget			1
pension liabilities have subsequently ballooned under his watch , topping $ 83 billion , according to the last report from debt ratings agency @entity90			2
coupled with other budgetary shortfalls , the pension liabilities have resulted in @entity90 's and other agencies downgrading @entity11 's credit rating eight times — a record for a sitting governor of the state , according to the @entity99			1
he also faces sluggish job growth			2
@entity11 's job growth has been slower than the national average , according to the @entity104 , and the state 's unemployment rate has been higher than the national average over the past year			1
for his part , @entity29 and his supporters are aggressively fighting back against the narrative that @entity11 's economy is sliding			1
during tuesday 's state of the state speech , the governor outlined his " @entity122 " record , a laundry list of mostly economic accomplishments @entity29 trumpets as a sign of good @entity0 management of the state 's pocket book			1
@entity13 gov. @entity31 is taking flak from both his right and his left , with critics saying at turns that he 's cut too much government funding and too little			1
his latest budget has seen some of the steepest cuts to higher education ever proposed for the state — so steep , in fact , the @entity0 speaker of the @entity130 has vowed to block block them , telling a local outlet the cuts " would set us back generations			2
" @entity31 and his allies , however , say they 've needed to enact steep cuts to balance the state 's budget			1
but even conservatives are dissatisfied , noting that to achieve a balanced budget , the governor has had to rely heavily on a non-replenishable pool of " onetime " funds that wo n't be available next year			2
" it 's frustrated many of us because it does go against what we typically say , and that is , we should not spend more money that 's coming in , " @entity13 state rep. @entity151 , a fiscally conservative @entity0 , said of @entity31 's budgets in an interview			1
" we face a very large shortfall as we go into the spring session of 2015 because we 've been relying too much on those onetime funds for recurring expenses			2
" @entity12 gov. @entity30 may also have to face scrutiny of a record that oversaw slower than national average job and wage growth , according to an analysis from @entity168			2
his office pushed back on the analysis , noting that the current 5.2 unemployment rate for the state is down from 7.8 when @entity30 came into office			2
@entity6 also point to the fact that job growth was uneven across low , middle and high - wage sectors — with middle - wage jobs , key to the stability of the middle class , declining during the recession , according to an analysis from @entity184 professor @entity183 — as evidence @entity30 has n't done enough for the middle class			2
and the state faces a $ 2.2 billion budget deficit heading into the new year			2
a @entity30 aide said , however , that 's a flawed prediction based on preliminary budget proposals , and that @entity30 will balance the final budget			2
" we will fund priorities and provide necessary services at a good value to taxpayers , " said spokeswoman @entity193			0
and @entity30 himself sought to paint a rosy picture of his state 's fiscal health during his @entity204 speech tuesday night			0
" we finished each year with a surplus , and we will again this year , " @entity30 said			0
" @entity12 's pension system is the only one fully funded in the country			0
the state 's pension and debt ratio is one of the best			0
our bond rating is positive			0
and the rainy day fund is the largest in state history — 165 times bigger than when we first took office			0
" @entity215 , president of the progressive @entity216 and a former governor of @entity218 , said he believes once the public begins " looking below the surface " of their records , " you 'll find there 's a lot of smoke and mirrors going on with the claims they 're making			0
" " in my judgment , they are so tied to an extreme ideology that they do n't want to be confronted by the facts and the truth about what their approach , their trickle - down approach leads to : greater deficits , a weaker economy , and greater inequality , " he said			1
but @entity31 , @entity29 and @entity30 all have accomplishments to tout as well			1
@entity29 has had to deal with a @entity6 legislature that 's often worked to block his legislative priorities ; @entity13 has become more business - friendly under @entity31 's watch , according to a number of nonpartisan rankings ; and @entity30 's union - breaking efforts were lauded as a model for other states nationwide			1
but strategists say they wo n't be able to run from the blemishes on their records			0
@entity256 , a spokesman for @entity258 's 2012 bid , said that every bit of the @entity0 presidential contender 's record as governor of @entity263 became susceptible to scrutiny when he ran			0
" it 's all fair game for your opposition — given that you are the executive of your state , " he said			0
" when you 're a governor running for president — you have to own whatever the pluses and minuses are for your state 's economic record , " he said			0
some @entity0 governors have better records than others			0
@entity279 gov. @entity278 , who 's contemplating another presidential run , travelled to other states , touting the @entity279 economy and trying to woo businesses with low tax rates			1
he could make his state 's economy a key pillar of a 2016 campaign			0
and some states governed by @entity6 , like @entity290 , have seen their share of economic struggles			1
but @entity6 are hoping to make even some of those governors that are n't running a problem for @entity0			0
they 've pointed to @entity52 gov. @entity297 , whose promised conservative " experiment " of implementing steep tax and spending cuts has crippled the state 's economy , as evidence the conservative vision of governance does n't work			0
@entity215 decried what he called an " exaggerated pursuit of the trickle - down agenda , " in @entity52 , " where taxes were cut for the wealthy and the economy is in shambles			0
" " that 's an example , i think , of what republicans are capable of doing if they were to win the presidency , " he said			1
some republicans believe @entity297 's labors will eventually bear fruit			1
@entity319 , president of the conservative anti-tax group @entity320 , lauded @entity297 's move and said he should jump in the race for 2016			0
" there is n't a problem in front of @entity297 and the @entity0 in @entity52 that they ca n't fix , " he said			0
" i think he should run for president — he 's radical , different , unexpected			0
" but there 's a growing chorus of voices within the @entity0 calling for a more moderate economic vision going forward			0
@entity333 gov. @entity332 has expressed an openness to a new gas tax , while gov. @entity65 has floated a tax on oil and gas companies to pay for an income tax cut			0
it 's that tension — between the moderate economic visions of purple - state governors and those of their red - state brothers — that could cause further complications for the @entity0 in a presidential primary fight , where they 'll have to debate the benefits of both approaches on a national stage			0
@entity352 , an economist at the conservative @entity353 , said in an interview that " @entity6 have some totally reasonable points " on the economy			0
" it 's not the case that if you cut tax rates , revenue is going to go up immediately , " he noted , calling such a suggestion " ludicrous			0
" he suggested the best solution for @entity0 governors was to take the middle road — and perhaps use @entity297 as a cautionary tale			0
a @entity0 governor with a struggling state economy could say , " i 'm a solid conservative governor with an eye to the deficit and the debt , but i 'm not going to take crazy stances in any direction , " @entity352 proposed			1

some republicans *mulling* @entity3 runs will have to defend struggling economies in their states
@entity29 in @entity11 and @entity31 in @entity13 both have deficits to explain
