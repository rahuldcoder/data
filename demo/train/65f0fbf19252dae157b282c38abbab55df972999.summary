@entity2 executed two @entity5 prisoners before dawn wednesday , following through on a promised strong response to the @entity9 killing of pilot @entity10 , a government spokesman said			1
put to death were @entity14 , the @entity15 would - be suicide bomber whose release @entity9 had previously requested , and @entity18 , a former top aide to the deceased leader of @entity5 in @entity15 , @entity20 , the spokesman said			1
@entity21 was executed for her role in a 2005 suicide bombing at a wedding reception in @entity2 that killed dozens			2
@entity18 was sentenced to death in 2007 after he was convicted of acts of terrorism that killed one person , the plotting of more terrorist attacks and the possession of explosives , the @entity2 spokesman said			2
the executions come a day after video and stills appeared to show a @entity2 military pilot being burned alive while confined in a cage			1
@entity3 is not showing images of the killing , which triggered global condemnation and prompted immediate promises of retaliation and protests in @entity2 , one of more than 60 nations involved in the @entity48 - led coalition against @entity9 in @entity15 and @entity49			1
the 22 - minute video begins with an attack on @entity2 's @entity52 , suggesting he is to blame for what happened to the pilot , @entity10			1
a short time after the video became public , @entity2 military spokesman @entity56 said @entity10 was " assassinated " on january 3			1
his statement indicates the back - and - forth in recent weeks between @entity2 and @entity9 about a possible prisoner exchange to free the pilot took place after his death			1
@entity2 repeatedly had asked @entity9 to show proof that @entity10 was alive			1
" those who doubted the atrocities committed by @entity9 now have the proof , " @entity2 government spokesman @entity63 said on state tv			1
" those who doubted @entity2 's power will soon see the proof as well			1
( @entity72 's ) blood will not be shed in vain			0
" in @entity75 and in the pilot 's hometown , crowds hit the streets , calling for revenge			1
" with the blood and self , " protesters chanted , " we are sacrificing ourselves for @entity10			0
" one demonstrator held a poster that read : " they burned our hearts , so let 's burn their dens , and their prisoners in our prisons			0
" analysts have predicted the brutality of its latest video could come back to bite @entity9			1
" i think there 's likely to be a backlash , particularly in @entity2 , " said @entity96 , a @entity3 terrorism analyst			1
" i think it 's sort of going to rally support for @entity52 and his participation in the @entity103 coalition			0
" @entity9 is known to be holding at least two @entity105 hostages still : @entity106 , a @entity107 journalist who has appeared in a number of @entity9 - produced videos and an @entity48 woman who is a 26 - year - old aid worker			2
" the propaganda factor , i think , is going to completely backfire on them and the reason i say that is : when was the last time you had a mob in the street of one of these @entity122 countries that was not screaming ' death to @entity48 , ' but in fact screaming , ' get revenge on @entity9 , ' which essentially means , team up with @entity48 , " said @entity115 , a @entity3 law enforcement analyst			2
" i think it 's a huge mistake on the part of @entity9			1
" @entity9 has recorded the deaths of its captives before , then disseminated the brutal footage online as propaganda			2
what makes the @entity2 pilot 's case different is that he hailed from a @entity137 nation taking part in the @entity103 military coalition			1
the manner of execution also is different			0
in previous @entity9 videos , captives were beheaded			2
a masked man with a @entity146 accent , dubbed " @entity147 , " has appeared in at least six videos , standing near hostages			0
sometimes , @entity9 has threatened who it will kill next			2
at the end of its latest video , @entity9 shows names and addresses of who it claims are @entity2 pilots			1
a reward is offered , and a voice says they are " wanted dead			0
" " i think they 're sending a clear message to the @entity164 members of the coalition , and certainly @entity166 who may be engaged in the fight against @entity9 , that this is the way they 're going to be treated			2
they 're going to be treated brutally , and in fact , maybe perhaps more brutally than other members of the coalition , " said @entity169 , a former @entity48 deputy national security adviser			0
militants said they captured @entity10 after he ejected from his crashing @entity174 on december 24 , having taken part in @entity48 - led coalition airstrikes near @entity177 , @entity49 , the de facto @entity9 capital			2
almost immediately , he became a major pawn for @entity9			2
the @entity181 extremist group had taken hostages before			0
but it had n't captured anyone from the @entity48 - led military coalition who was actively fighting to defeat it			0
his capture got the attention of many in @entity2 , including @entity52 , who is a former helicopter pilot			1
@entity2 officials had talked openly about the possibility of swapping @entity191 , a jihadist imprisoned in @entity2 , for @entity10			2
that demand was made via @entity194 journalist @entity193 , who also was taken captive by @entity9			0
@entity193 , like other hostages before him , was killed , according to a video posted saturday , before any exchange could occur			0
gen. @entity199 , commander of @entity200 , said he 's been in touch with the head of @entity2 's armed forces about what he called @entity9 ' " savage murder			1
" president @entity207 said that the latest video , if authentic , is " just one more indication of the viciousness and barbarity of this organization			1
" " it , i think , will redouble the vigilance and determination on the part of a global coalition to make sure that they are degraded and ultimately defeated , " @entity207 said			0
" it also just indicates the degree to which whatever ideology they 're operating off of , it 's bankrupt			0
" he met tuesday with @entity2 's king , who cut short a trip to @entity228 following the pilot 's killing			1
the president 's comments were echoed in a statement from defense secretary @entity234			0
" this horrific , savage killing is yet another example of @entity239 's contempt for life itself , " he said , using another common acronym for @entity9			1
" the @entity48 and its military stand steadfast alongside our @entity2 friends and partners ; @entity2 remains a pillar of our global coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy @entity239 , and this act of despicable barbarity only strengthens our shared resolve			0
" according to the @entity250 , an @entity251 newspaper published daily in the kingdom , @entity10 , 27 , held the rank of lieutenant			0
one of eight children , he comes from @entity258 governorate and graduated from @entity259 , the newspaper says			0
at the time of his capture , his father , @entity260 , told the @entity250 that his son was " a very modest and religious person " who memorized the @entity265 and " was never harmful to anyone			0
" @entity260 later demanded that @entity2 do everything it could to free his son			0
" i firmly ask whomever has sent @entity10 to fight outside the borders of @entity2 , on a mission unrelated to us , to make strong efforts to bring back @entity273 , " he said			1
" @entity10 's blood is precious , it 's precious and it represents the blood of all @entity2			2
" @entity48 secretary of state @entity277 described @entity10 as everything he says @entity9 is not : " he was brave , compassionate and principled			0
" " that he was murdered after his father 's plea for compassion reminds all the world that this foe has no agenda other than to kill and destroy , and places no value on life , including that of fellow @entity166 , " @entity277 said			0
@entity3 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 contributed to this report .			0
