-- sometimes an actor takes on the role of an iconic figure and they do a good job			0
sometimes they do a lousy job			0
but sometimes , very rarely , they disappear into their role so perfectly that all you have left is the person they 're playing			0
such is the case with @entity14 in @entity16 ' moving and thoroughly enjoyable " @entity17			1
" about 15 minutes into the film , the first she 's been called on to completely carry , @entity14 vanishes			1
it 's a magnificent performance and one of the most heartbreaking celebrity stories there is			0
in the summer of 1956 , @entity26 , newly married to writer @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , traveled to @entity27 to shoot " @entity31 " with co-star / director @entity28 ( @entity30 )			1
the third assistant director , aka gofer , on that production was @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , a 24 - year - old aspiring filmmaker on whose memoir the film is based			0
he rapidly became @entity26 's confidant and ally , the only person on the crew on whom she could rely			1
needless to say , he fell hopelessly in love with her , but really , what choice did he have ? @entity26 was like a lottery ticket			1
you know you 're not going to win , but when those numbers come up , damned if you 're not sure you 're going to pocket millions			0
of course @entity35 would n't actually have won had he ended up with @entity26 , but she was someone who men desperately wanted to take care of			1
after all , she was @entity26			1
that 's a roll of the dice very few would be able to pass up			0
as @entity26 , @entity14 is nothing short of dazzling			1
she 's managed to inhabit perhaps the most iconic woman in @entity59 history and not only her public persona , at that			0
to do a decent job of mimicking a well - known figure , all one has to do is capture their mannerisms and voice and let the makeup department handle the rest			0
however to truly capture the essence of someone , the actor has to convince us that we 're watching them , not an actor playing them			0
we have to believe that if , for example , no record of that person in casual situations exists , the actor has captured what they would actually be like			0
we have all seen images of @entity26 , @entity85 and @entity86 , perhaps the three most - famous @entity88 entertainers in history , in public , on stage or in films			1
but there 's very little recorded of them in private times			0
what @entity14 does is create a fully realized portrait of @entity26			1
it does n't matter if her portrayal is 100 % accurate			2
it feels 100 % accurate			0
as for the production within the film , @entity26 's reputation of difficulty on the set follows her to @entity27 , and what 's more , she brings acting coach @entity112 ( wife of famed acting teacher @entity114 , played by @entity115 ) with her			1
whenever things get rough for her , which was often , @entity17 retreats to her dressing room or cottage with @entity103 , leaving @entity28 to stew and the production be damned			1
as the director and star , @entity28 is used to getting his way and is not a method actor			0
he does n't understand @entity26 's need to believe in her character and finds her questions about motivation frustrating			1
one ca n't help but be reminded of the ( likely at least partially apocryphal ) story about @entity28 on the set of " @entity128 " when , after @entity129 has stayed up all night supposedly to accurately portray his character 's state of mind , @entity28 retorted with something along the lines of : " why do n't you try acting , dear boy			2
it 's so much easier			0
" it 's a case of when styles collide and at one point @entity30 explodes on set that " teaching @entity17 how to act is like trying to teach @entity141 to a badger ! " it 's a great line , and @entity30 is excellent as @entity28			2
it serves to underscore the differences in their styles and how frustrating @entity26 's behavior was for @entity28			2
for her part , @entity28 's bluster turned @entity26 's already present insecurities into full - blown panic attacks			2
when you 're watching @entity14 go through @entity26 's struggle with self - doubt and an increasingly serious pill problem , there 's no doubt in your mind that it 's @entity26			1
you feel her pain , her fears and , on a rare occasion , her joy			0
@entity14 perfectly captures @entity26 's legendary vulnerabilities and in the culmination of a series of scenes , the duality of @entity26 , the person she was , and @entity26 , the woman she became			1
after an afternoon spent secretly touring @entity169 , courtesy of sir @entity171 ( @entity35 's godfather and the castle librarian , played by @entity174 ) , @entity35 and @entity26 are spotted by castle staff			2
leaning into @entity35 , @entity26 whispers " shall i be her ? " and instantly , @entity26 disappears and @entity17 is there , shimmying , posing and doing exactly what 's expected of her			1
it seems like she gets a kick out of it but at the same time , there 's a sadness in her leaving @entity26 behind , once again			2
at once lightweight and melancholy , " @entity17 " does n't purport to reveal any deep , dark secrets or illuminate any truths that we already do n't know			1
in fact , we do n't know for certain that any of this actually happened at all			0
i 'd like to think that it did , though			0
" @entity17 " is rated r and contains some foul language , pill - popping and some discrete female nudity .			2

as @entity26 , @entity14 is nothing short of dazzling
what @entity14 does is create a fully realized portrait of @entity26
" @entity17 " does n't purport to reveal any deep , dark secrets
