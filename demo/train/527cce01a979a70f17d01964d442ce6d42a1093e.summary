@entity0 -- when it comes to fighting corruption , virtually all @entity4 give the " thumbs up			0
" they liken it to " a rat scampering across the street -- everyone is crying ' beat it up ! ' " this resentment is mirrored in recent public opinion polls , which list graft among the respondents ' top grievances , along with pollution and the rising cost of living , according to the state - run @entity20 news agency			1
far from ignoring this growing discontent , president @entity23 's new administration has been targeting @entity26 officials and government bureaucrats whom they believe to be guilty of " severe breaches of discipline , " a favored euphemism for corruption			1
the @entity4 refer to more minor officials accused of corruption as " flies " and their more senior counterparts as " tigers			2
" so far , the campaign has claimed more flies than tigers			2
but the list of high - flying officials who have gone from fame to shame include @entity41 , the fallen former party chief of @entity42 , who was recently put on trial and is now awaiting the court 's verdict			1
timeline : @entity41 scandal the campaign has also snared the former railway minister , @entity49 , who was meted a suspended death sentence , and @entity51 ( no relation ) , a former vice minister of the powerful @entity53			1
big catch however , the big news this week has been the dismissal of @entity57 , 58 , the minister of the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , for " serious disciplinary violations			0
" @entity57 's dismissal is stunning news			2
he is a member of the @entity62 , the @entity26 's policy - making body , and has supervised all the central state - owned enterprises ( @entity64 ) , which generate massive revenue and jobs			1
he was promoted into the post only last march			0
before that , he was the former chairman of @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , one of the biggest @entity71 companies in @entity4			0
his dismissal follows investigations into @entity74 , a former deputy party chief of the southwestern @entity77 province , and four other top oil executives			0
many of these officials are known to be allies of @entity82 , who held senior positions in @entity4 's oil industry			1
he wielded enormous influence over @entity4 's security apparatus when he served as a member of the nine - person @entity88 until he retired last november			1
rumors this has prompted rumors on @entity4 social media that @entity82 is also being investigated			0
" if the stories about @entity82 are true -- and the naming of his associates as targets of corruption investigations surely indicates he is under pressure -- then @entity23 is taking @entity4 in an especially dangerous direction , " said @entity94 , author of the book " the coming collapse of @entity4			2
" " i think the @entity26 is in the early stages of tearing itself apart , " he added			0
@entity94 says @entity23 faces grave political risks if he is indeed targeting @entity82			1
" since the end of the @entity108 , senior leaders , as a means of ensuring unity and continuity of @entity26 rule , have honored the agreement not to prosecute each other , " @entity94 said			0
" if they can no longer be sure they are safe in retirement , politics will inevitably return to the brutishness of the @entity121 era			0
@entity122 lowered the cost of losing political struggles			0
@entity23 is raising the stakes , perhaps to extremely high levels			1
" other analysts are not convinced that @entity23 is going after @entity82 just yet			1
" it will be too destabilizing , " said @entity128 , professor at the @entity129			2
" @entity23 wants to use the anti-corruption campaign to enhance his popularity and consolidate his power			1
" cases of @entity41 and @entity49 were initiated by his predecessors			2
@entity23 wants to show that he too is also going after important officials and is ready to tackle vested interests			1
he wants to do this before the @entity139 of the @entity26			0
" economic reforms the plenum , a bi-annual conclave which sets major policies , is now scheduled to convene in @entity0 in november			0
the new @entity4 leadership is expected to unveil a package of economic reforms later this year to stimulate domestic consumption as an alternative source of growth instead of relying on investment and exports that have propelled the economy for the past 30 years			0
@entity128 says @entity23 is showing strength , not weakness , by going after powerful vested interests			1
he says @entity23 's anti-graft campaign is tied to economic reform			1
" he wants to reduce the privileges of the state sector , to make it more competitive and innovative , and to offer a level playing field to the private sector , " @entity128 explained			2
on the political front , however , @entity23 has shown little sign of loosening up			2
a document , known as " document no. 9 " and distributed internally by the @entity26 's central committee , warns that " @entity169 forces hostile to @entity4 and dissidents within the country are still constantly infiltrating the ideological sphere			0
" these opponents , the document says , " have stirred up trouble about disclosing officials ' assets , using the @entity176 to fight corruption , media controls and other sensitive topics , to provoke discontent with the party and government			0
" public pressure but with @entity4 's economy slowing , the rich - poor gap growing and social tension intensifying , analysts say @entity23 needs to champion initiatives that resonate with the public , such as fighting graft			1
since taking over the reins as @entity4 's paramount leader , @entity23 has issued warnings about how corrupt practices risk soiling the party 's image and threaten national stability			1
" we must uphold the fighting of tigers and flies at the same time , resolutely investigating law - breaking cases of leading officials and also earnestly resolving the unhealthy tendencies and corruption problems which happen all around people , " @entity23 said in a speech addressing the @entity26 's top discipline body , @entity20 reported in january			1
@entity23 has even directed the spotlight on the @entity212 , where his wife @entity213 serves as a senior officer			2
he has issued directives banning drinking and extravagant dining -- particularly among senior officers -- and called for audits of military - owned assets			0
more recently , the @entity212 issued a directive tightening approval of gala performances by army singers and dancers			0
military performers , like @entity213 , are now asked not to perform in privately - funded performances and casinos , and not to take part in local tv talent shows			0
they are also ordered not to set up companies or studios for personal financial purposes			0
while @entity23 may earn praise for showing his resolve in tackling corruption , it remains to be seen if he can sustain the campaign long enough to eradicate " all the rats which still roam the corridors of power " in @entity4 .			1

president @entity23 's new administration has been targeting corrupt officials
former rising star @entity41 has been the most high - profile case so far
but some analysts wonder whether this drive is politically - motivated
