-- @entity1 is the rare athlete who transcends the sport in which he is considered one of the greatest players of all time			1
it has n't been easy			0
there have been glamour moments : the baseball superstar dated @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , among others			2
handsome , rich and dapper , " @entity1 " is considered a man - about - town			1
the tabloids loved it all and once renamed him " @entity17			0
" the larger - than - life behavior cost him his marriage , by which he had two children , in 2008			2
on the diamond , the slugger 's performance has been exceptional , though he has been recovering from off - season hip surgery and , more recently , a tight quadricep this year			1
@entity1 , @entity29 negotiating suspension , @entity30 says his long list of accomplishments makes him a living legend still in the game , and fans flock to the field just to see the great @entity37 at bat one more time			1
the @entity39 third baseman is a three - time @entity40 , 14 - time all - star and two - time @entity42			1
he owns one @entity44 ring , with the @entity39 in 2009			0
the baseball records have been sullied , however , by his prior admission of using banned substances in the early 2000s and by newer allegations this past year of having used performance - enhancing drugs			1
those scandals take on bigger meaning because of @entity1 's unique mark in baseball : he has the largest contract ever in @entity56 sports , at $ 275 million over 10 years , signed with the @entity39 in 2007			1
his detractors call it the worst deal ever because of @entity1 's health and playing lapses as well as his roguery , including when he flirted with two blond female fans sitting near the @entity39 dugout in playoff game in october			1
the team was swept in the @entity67			0
war of words between @entity1 and @entity39 this season is supposed to begin the last great hurrah for @entity1 , the early verses of a swan song			1
he just turned 38 on july 27 , and he was recovering from his second hip surgery since 2009 -- " definitely the hardest surgery i 've had to overcome , " he told @entity0			2
@entity1 is poised to surpass major milestones : 3,000 hits , 2,000 rbis and 2,000 runs			1
he now has 647 homers , and while he admitted he has n't been the long - ball hitter he used to be , maybe a couple of more seasons could put him at the 700 mark			2
he recently expressed the urgency of the moment			0
performance enhancing drugs in sports " look , there 's no hiding it			1
i 'm not a spring chicken anymore			0
i 'm going to be 38 here in july			0
but i do think i can contribute , " @entity1 said last month			2
" i think i can be a force in the middle lineup , a big right - handed bat for our team , but i 'm at a different stage of my career			0
is it realistic to go out and hit 40 , 50 home runs ? i do n't think so			0
but can i go out and have nights like i did last night and do that several times a week ? i think so			0
" @entity1 was referring to his home run in a minor league game in @entity109 , where he was testing his surgically repaired hip			2
his return date to the @entity39 lineup has been a cipher all season			0
the injury did n't help him in a bigger controversy about his health : @entity1 was accused of having ties with the now - shuttered @entity121 anti-aging clinic in south @entity122 and taking performance enhancing drugs			1
judge : @entity29 can sue @entity122 clinic @entity1 has denied the accusation			2
the stakes are intensified because it 's not the first time he has faced issues about doping			2
in 2009 , he admitted to using " a banned substance " over three years when he was playing for the @entity132 beginning in 2001			0
media reports said the drug was steroids , and pundits relabeled him " a-roid			0
" the admission -- along with the recent allegations -- could alter his legacy : some sport analysts say @entity1 may struggle , once he retires , in the @entity143 voting selection process			2
in whatever way history may judge him , there 's no denying how @entity1 has made much of his life			1

his mother held two jobs , as a waitress and secretary			0
opinion : the worst sports contract ever his parents moved him and their two other children to the @entity151 when @entity1 was 4			1
the family then moved to the @entity166 area when @entity1 was 8			2
later , his parents divorced , but not before @entity1 learned some baseball from his father			1
his mother sent him to a @entity169 private school , where he became well - groomed , well - mannered and a high school athlete who excelled at just about every sport			0
by 18 , at 6 - foot - 3 and 195 pounds , he was playing for the @entity172 at shortstop			0
much bigger than the typical shortstop , he helped redefine the position			0
he won many awards and honors at @entity178 , then at the @entity132 , and finally at the @entity39 , who signed him in 2004			0
as he became wealthy , he donated millions to charity , including for facilities and scholarships benefiting youngsters in the @entity184 of @entity185 in south @entity122			0
