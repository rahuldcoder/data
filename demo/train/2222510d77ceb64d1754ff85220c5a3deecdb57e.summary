-- the financial world was thrown into a tailspin this week as credit ratings agency @entity3 's first downgraded @entity5 's debt rating to junk status , and also lowered the ratings of @entity8 and @entity9			1
behind the headlines stand the firms that make the calls on the market , which begs a closer look at these powerful players in the global economy			0
who are the credit ratings agencies ? the " big three " are @entity19 's , @entity20 and @entity21			2
all originated in the @entity23 , although @entity21 has dual headquarters in @entity25 and @entity26			0
what do they do ? they are designed to provide independent analysis of the credit worthiness -- the ability to pay off loans or investments -- of companies , countries and financial products			0
they rate them on a sliding scale ranging from @entity41 to @entity42 in the case of government bonds , anything that slips to @entity46 + , as was the case with @entity5 this week , is considered a " highly speculative " investment : or " junk bonds " in the parlance of the markets			1
why do they wield such power ? investors across the world look to credit ratings agencies to judge where to place their bets in the market			0
for governments , the ratings agencies have a lot of power over the popularity of bonds : cash given to governments like @entity5 by investors that , over time , will pay a return on the original investment -- unless the government defaults			2
the downgrade of @entity5 signaled @entity3 's belief that @entity5 has a higher likelihood to default on investments			1
it caused investors to lose their appetite to invest in bonds from @entity5 , which imperils the nation 's ability to pay down its deficit -- which now stands more than 13 percent higher than the total economic output of the country			1
what @entity5 's debt rating downgrade means the decisions of credit rating agencies also have a ripple effect through the market : in the wake of the @entity5 downgrade , investors across the globe started rethinking investment in other governments ' bonds and began selling off more risky investments			1
how are they paid ? historically , they were created to give investors an unbiased assessment of investments and investors paid for access to the ratings			0
in the 1970s , however , credit rating agencies started charging the issuers of new investments fees for ratings			2
in 1975 , @entity23 legislators -- fearing a proliferation of unscrupulous ratings agencies -- designated @entity3 's , @entity20 's and @entity21 as the only ratings organizations banks and brokers could use to evaluate the credit worthiness of their products			1
what are the complaints against the firms ? critics complain the agencies have lost their ability to independently judge the risk on certain investments -- especially in light of @entity41 ratings given to mortgage - backed securities that imploded when defaults on @entity23 home loans shot up , triggering the financial crisis			2
lawmakers in the @entity23 , the @entity132 and other countries around the world are now reviewing regulations on the credit ratings agencies			0
credit ratings agencies , too , have revamped their procedures and have argued their ratings are merely opinions -- it 's up to the markets to decide .			0

@entity5 's debt rating lowered to junk status , @entity8 and @entity9 also drops
decision by @entity3 's sparks an investor sell - off
critics say the *eurozone* economies are *n't* acting fast enough to avert crisis
