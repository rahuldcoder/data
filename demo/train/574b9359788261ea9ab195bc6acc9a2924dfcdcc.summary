-- @entity2 's revolution has made life tougher still for @entity5 's 80,000 taxi drivers , struggling to make a living on the city 's chaotic , congested and potholed streets , says the author who has written a best - selling book about them			1
@entity13 's novel " taxi , " first published in 2006 , has been translated into 10 languages			1
it features 58 fictional monologues with taxi drivers recreated from his own experience			1
a new post-revolution @entity22 edition has just been published			2
despite the optimism that swept @entity2 after president @entity25 was toppled in february , @entity13 said taxi drivers , and the rest of the country 's poor , have in fact suffered more since then			1
" my taxi drivers are among the 55 % of the population living under the poverty line of $ 2 a day , " said @entity13			1
" those 55 % were not on the streets during the revolution and are without a real voice now			1
" they are wise , they are watching , they are analyzing , but they are not acting			2
" he added : " life has changed for them in the wrong direction			2
it 's worse for them because we have no security and living on the streets without security is dangerous			2
" there is less tourism and more chaos on the streets			2
" @entity13 said it was too early to tell if life was improving for the middle classes who took to the streets during the revolution			1
" we are in the middle of a battle , and during the battle we ca n't see whether life is improving or not , " he said			2
@entity13 , whose second novel " @entity64 " -- also a bestseller -- was published in 2009 , said he stopped writing his third novel at the start of the uprising on january 25 this year and has been unable to concentrate on writing since			1
" it 's impossible to write because my mind is taken with what is happening day after day , hour after hour , " he said			0
since january , @entity13 has filled his time with a weekly newspaper column , lectures and speaking events			1
but the author wants to get back to writing fiction			1
" every night i want to write because it is my only job , my only happiness , " he said			0
" i have to find a solution soon or i will die			0
" " taxi " was credited with single - handedly reviving an interest in reading in @entity2 , according to its publisher @entity81 , but @entity13 denies his book is responsible			1
he said : " some journalists have said that about my book , but it 's nonsense to say that one book or 10 books can change reading habits			0
" @entity90 has increased in the last six years , but it has taken many social factors			0
we have had a cultural revolution in the last six years in all matters : theater , music , fiction and publishing			2
" this cultural revolution is related to youth searching for a dream			2
" @entity13 said he dreams of an @entity2 where taxi drivers could have the time and education to read his -- or any other -- book			1
" they do n't have time to read because they are struggling to survive , " he said			0
" when we can increase the quality of education and decrease poverty , then they will be able to read			0
i 'm not interested in whether they read my book , i just hope they will read anything			0
" another novelist credited with changing reading habits in @entity2 is @entity120 , a 49 - year - old medical professor described by @entity81 as the @entity123 world 's most prominent bestselling author of fantasy and horror			1
he has written more than 200 books , selling millions of copies			0
he said he was among the first @entity2 authors to write for young people			0
" twenty years ago there was nothing for 16 , 17 , 18 - year - olds to read , " said @entity120			1
" we invented popular literature			0
i think i made the youth fond of reading			0
" i think most of my readers were in @entity138			0
i changed a part of their thinking , although you ca n't compare that to their economic disappointment or the scourge of the police system			0
" @entity120 's book " @entity149 , " which has just been published in @entity22 , is a grim futuristic account of @entity2 society in the year 2023 with wealthy gated communities insulated from the poverty outside			1
@entity120 said that despite @entity2 's revolution , he still fears the scenes in his book , first published in @entity157 in 2009 , could come true			1
" the first uprising came from the middle class , but i think another bloodier one could come from the lower classes , like described in my book ' @entity149 '			0
" i still think there 's a danger my book could come true			2
" he added : " after nine months , nothing has been accomplished except getting rid of @entity25			0
we got rid of the head of the snake , but the body of the snake is still ruling everything			0

life has got harder for taxi drivers since the revolution , says @entity13
author has been unable to concentrate on writing since january
my grim futuristic novel could come true , says author @entity120
