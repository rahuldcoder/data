@entity0 , @entity1 -- he got his first big break at art school , when an employee from @entity7 saw his graduation show and commissioned him to design some disposable razors			2
today , @entity10 is one of the world 's leading figures in design			1
as one half of @entity16 design agency @entity15 , he is responsible for such milestone products as the pocket mobile phone and cordless kettle and has designed for major institutions including @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 ©			1
he has twice been appointed president of the @entity16 's @entity26 ( @entity27 ) board , who honored his outstanding contribution to creativity with their @entity32			2
recently , somewhere in between working on a new concept for the @entity35 spacecraft and running a business , @entity10 has found time to take on a new role -- that of the mentor			1
not a stranger to tv after his series " @entity42 " with company co-founder @entity43 , @entity10 appears on screen for @entity2 's @entity46 to offer guidance to a group of ambitious students who have created electricity conducting paint			1
we caught the design kingpin for an exclusive q&a			2
@entity2 : what are the three most important principles of good product design ? @entity10 : that 's easy			1
design is about making things better -- that means better for people , better for business and better for the world			1
@entity2 : which product from the last decade is the best example of a meeting between form and function ? @entity70 : @entity72 's @entity71			1
it 's what we call a meta - product , so it 's a combination of hardware , software and service			1
@entity2 : what 's the best way for an amateur designer to turn a great idea into a reality ? @entity70 : never give up			1
that would be the first piece of advice			0
getting a new product to market is an amazingly difficult thing to do			0
it 's not about the design			1
the design is just one part of it			2
you need the finance to fund it			0
the most important thing , which most people get wrong , is that they think they have a good idea when in fact it 's probably not a good idea			2
it 's a great idea to them but they need to think very hard about their potential market and be convinced that it is going to have a volume acceptance , because you ca n't get products to market without high numbers			1
also , people often forget about distribution -- it is fine to have a great product but you 've got to get it in front of people			0
@entity2 : how does the environment you work in affect creativity ? @entity70 : i think it 's more about culture than environment			1
it 's important to have a great office and studio to work in but it 's really about the culture -- inside the studio and the business is what matters			0
if you 've got an innovative and creative culture alive in the business then that is all you need			0
@entity2 : how do you keep the spirit of innovation in your company alive ? @entity70 : by always striving to be better , by never being satisfied with the way things are			2
@entity2 : some areas of industry , such as healthcare , have greatly benefited from innovative design			1
are there any industries that you think are crying out for pioneering design solutions ? @entity70 : i do n't think so , no. i think nearly every industry i can think of has become involved with design to a greater or lesser degree but there are none out there that are crying out for it that i can think of			0
i think the service industry is going to benefit the most in the near future			0
it comes back to what i was saying about meta - products			2
what defines them is that they provide a service of some kind , so from the machine that gives you your money out of a wall to the car you drive			0
for the @entity178 we are going to be seeing , to a much greater extent , the provision of service with everything that we buy and use			0
@entity2 : is product design a science or an art ? @entity70 : well , it 's a combination of those two things that really defines design			1
it 's not necessarily science			0
i suppose it could be seen as a science			0
quiz : looks cool ... what does it do ? @entity2 : what are the most common mistakes people make when designing a new product ? @entity70 : designing a product is like juggling plates			2
one plate might be function and another might be market , another manufacturers , another cost and another look and feel			0
there are 15 or 20 of those plates and you 've got to keep them all spinning all of the time			0
designers tend to spin up one or two of them , particularly look and feel , at the expense of the others and the they start to fall off			0
cost is a plate that often falls off			0
designers get carried away with look and feel and function and lose sight of cost , manufacturer ability , distribution and market			0
@entity2 : what is the proudest achievement in your career to date ? @entity70 : i think it 's when @entity232 and i received the @entity27 president 's @entity32			1
@entity2 : what 's the best piece of advice anyone has ever given you ? @entity70 : well it 's a universal truth : treat others as you like to be treated yourself .			1
