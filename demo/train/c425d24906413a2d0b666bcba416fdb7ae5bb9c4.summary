@entity0 , @entity1 -- the lava flow has slowed , if not stalled altogether			1
still , authorities warned thursday that the threat to eastern @entity1 residents -- much like the oozing , simmering , destructive lava itself -- has n't gone away			1
@entity10 , the director of the @entity11 , told reporters that " there 's been no movement forward " at the front of the destructive lava stream between wednesday and thursday			1
" but there 's lots of activity behind it , " @entity10 said			1
" ... there are breakouts along the margins that we 'll have to watch and be wary of			0
" the lava began moving toward the area of @entity0 , on @entity1 's @entity1 , in june , when a volcanic crater vented and released the river of liquid rock			1
it 's been creeping along ever since , with authorities warning at one point the main road in @entity0 could be overcome by friday morning			2
the lack of recent movement changes that equation , though the main flow -- which is about 20 yards wide at its tip , expanding to 100 yards farther back -- is still within about 480 feet of that street			2
there 's no guarantee of what happens next , including whether the stream resumes its forward movement or whether any of its offshoots encroach on people or properties			2
a @entity49 geologist has said the lava flow could continue for 30 years			1
as @entity51 , a geologist with the @entity52 , explained thursday : " the flow is still active , and there is still scattered activity in the flow			1
" so it 's just a matter of where that activity is at any given moment			1
" on wednesday , @entity61 said about 20 families in the path of the lava have been told to evacuate			1
many others have packed up , " prepared to move at a moment 's notice " should they , too , get the order			2
" you can see some of them walking around ; they are still very upset , distraught , frustrated -- the full range of emotions as they 're dealing with this crisis , " the civil defense director said thursday			1
so far , thankfully , no homes have been buried			0
instead , it 's mostly grass and vegetation that have been immersed and scorched			0
this is n't a lazy river , after all			0
it 's a 2,000 - degree river of molten rock , the kind that a firefighter ca n't use a hose to stop			2
" as it moves across soil , you can hear and smell the fire , " said @entity90 of the @entity91			0
" it is incredibly hot ... the heat is very strong			0
" that 's why there are ongoing efforts to make sure people and property are protected , as well as to clear out any hazardous materials , such as those at a one - time gas station , in the lava 's potential path			2
local civil defense officials got some help thursday , in the form of 80 @entity112 members			0
@entity61 explained that these guardsmen will drive around on patrols as an extra set of eyes			0
he said , " as long as we need them , they 'll be here			0
" what to know about volcanoes @entity2 's @entity122 reported from @entity0 ; @entity123 reported and wrote from @entity124			0
@entity2 's @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
