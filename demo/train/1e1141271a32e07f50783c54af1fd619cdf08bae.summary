-- meat grinders grinding people			2
and body parts -- everywhere			0
sending you screaming will be the mission of the @entity8 when it opens this week in @entity10			1
marketed as the only year - round horror attraction in @entity10 -- the first of its kind -- the hotel - themed haunt is the work of @entity19 , the actor - writer - director who has built a career on low - budget , blood - drenched horror films such as " hostel " and its sequel			1
@entity19 will be making a special appearance on opening night , performing an illusion that 's actually pretty dangerous , ceo @entity22 said			1
@entity19 's surprise will be only the first of the evening			1
get your kicks on @entity30 the pitch is archetypal : the @entity8 is actually " the @entity32 , " a ' 60s - era hotel whose owners make sure the guests enter -- and never leave			1
there 's a haunted elevator , a go - go lounge and a chapel , which will be open for real - world weddings			1
a stew of horror tropes mixed with an eye for decade - crossing design , the @entity42 has been planned down to its last detail , @entity22 said , including the costumes , sound design and even the slot machines featured in the lobby 's casino			1
the scares themselves are just as carefully planned			0
at any one time , there will be 35 to 40 actors at work , many of whom have previous experience in " haunt environments " such as haunted houses			0
the floor plan is interactive and free - form , so attendees can choose their own path , whether that means a trip to the laundry room full of squeaky - clean human skin or a peek at the bathrooms , where the mirrors drip blood			2
but even though the @entity8 has been built with a flurry of high - tech tricks , the scariest moments are n't necessarily the most advanced , @entity22 said			1
sometimes it 's the low - tech stuff that guests should watch out for			2
one thing the @entity8 is n't afraid of is going stale			2
there are plans to add new scares often , @entity22 said			0
tickets are $ 35 if purchased online			0
there will be new things to run away from as early as @entity86 and @entity87 ; it should take repeat customers six or seven trips to see everything , and that 's the point			0
" we 'll get you when you least expect it , " @entity22 said			0
time : finally , booze comes to @entity97			0
