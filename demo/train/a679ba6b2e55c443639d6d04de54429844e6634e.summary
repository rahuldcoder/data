@entity0 -- @entity0 is a place whose story is often told by the numbers			1
it was home to 2 million residents at its peak , but now the city is down to roughly 700,000			1
and all of those residents live in a 139 - square - mile city grappling with millions of dollars in debt that led the city to file for bankruptcy			1
but 700,000 people still make their home here			2
there are square miles of the city that are empty , yes			1
but the rest of @entity0 still has to live somewhere			1
and where they 're living , they 're really living			2
they 're operating barber shops and beauty salons , they 're working to build @entity32 and @entity33 at the @entity34 , they 're going to see the @entity36 soccer team play at @entity37			2
beyond the abandoned train station and empty @entity39 is a city slowly making its way back from the brink			1
what @entity0 will look like in the years to come is anyone 's guess , but it does n't mean things have ground to a halt in the meantime			1
so what do you do in @entity0 ? know that you have n't left civilization			1
it 's a city , an @entity53 city			2
it 's going through a tough time , sure			0
@entity0 's problems show themselves more than other cities			1
but assess : why are you in @entity0 ? for business ? for pleasure ? for curiosity ? regardless of why you 're here , there will be something here you 'll never forget			1
welcome , and open your mind			0
savor @entity72 and @entity72 - @entity53 art. the great migration out of the rural @entity67 that began before @entity68 coupled with opportunities within the automotive industry made @entity0 an enduring stronghold of african - american culture			1
the city of @entity0 is home to one of the largest collectives of black artists , and the @entity80 one of the world 's best - curated collections of art from the @entity72 diaspora			1
also consider checking out the @entity86 , the shrine of the @entity89 bookstore and cultural center and pockets of mostly black - owned boutiques , galleries and eateries on the @entity95 along the northern portion of @entity97 on the city 's northwest side			1
there are no more calming places anywhere than cemeteries , but @entity108 is special because of the haunting , @entity103 monuments among lush , tree - lined paths			2
the founding fathers of @entity0 -- and @entity111 -- are buried here			1
and while you 're on this side of town , head over to @entity116 , the city 's premier historic district that once served as home to some of the area 's wealthiest auto barons where houses still are maintained and occupied by many of the city 's power brokers			2
or stop for some coffee at one of the cafes in nearby @entity129			0
even in a city built around the auto industry , there are hidden gems where your own two feet remain the best mode of transportation			2
stroll down the brick - laid , @entity138 - lined @entity137 -- where no cars are allowed			2
while this residential pedestrian avenue takes you to a quieter , simpler time , it was developed by none other than the workhorses at @entity147			0
the automaker had its headquarters nearby on @entity150 and sought to redevelop the area after a slow decline in the 1960s			0
while the plan did n't quite work out -- @entity147 moved its headquarters downtown in the 1990s -- the residents there have maintained the original vision			0
and if you 're feeling hungry , stop by @entity161 nearby for the best chicken and waffles in town			0
get hip to the latest pop - ups			1
the barrier of entry to entrepreneurship is lower in @entity0 , and many budding business owners are taking advantage of the pop - up model to establish themselves			1
and other local talent finds them			2
take the @entity175 , for one : wherever @entity0 native @entity177 ' traveling stand two dollar tacos pops up , there 's sure to be a good time			1
class has connections with nearly all of @entity0 's up - and - coming artists and musicians displaying their talents citywide			1
look for @entity186 on @entity187			0
sample culinary creations beyond the coney dog			0
there are plenty of nooks and crannies hiding delicacies unique to @entity0 that contribute to the city 's flavor , and these handmade corned beef concoctions wrapped in egg rolls are hidden gems			1
true to many locally owned joints , @entity190 has one place on the west side ( 13660 @entity204 ) and one on the east side ( 2847 e. @entity207 )			0
football + bowling = @entity210			0
got that ? the story behind that portmanteau is this : the proprietor of @entity217 and his family invented a summer game based on horseshoes , except instead of ringing horseshoes around a metal rod , you knock down bowling pins with a football			0
sounds easy enough , but veterans of the @entity0 - bred sport know better			1
all the activity at @entity217 is spur - of - the - moment , so it 's not uncommon for one - on - one matches to morph into an all - out dodgeball - style tournament with more footballs and pins			2
they 're in two locations : sundays at @entity233 and a new location at a factory -- yes , a factory -- at @entity237 in @entity238 , a small city surrounded by @entity0			1
do n't go urban exploring			0
why would you want to go into an abandoned building ? they 're old , they 're dangerous , they 're full of asbestos			0
the street cred associated with going through these places is long gone			0
and most detroiters are offended if that 's the only reason you visit			0
lastly , it 's illegal -- and with more police on the streets thanks to donated patrol cars and a shift in internal structure , you 're running a greater risk			0
if you 'd like to explore a beautiful building , try the @entity261 - designed 1928 @entity260 in @entity262 , a commercial district north of downtown , or the 1928 @entity264 on @entity265			2
do n't ask stupid questions			0
yes , @entity267 is a real place			0
no , 8 mile is n't exactly like the movie " 8 mile			0
" do n't make assumptions , and use the same common sense in @entity0 that you would anywhere else			1
remember that people are people			0
detroiters are not meant to be ogled like exhibits in a museum			0
they 're not to be talked down to , pitied , shamed or treated with kid gloves			0
the so - called " grit , " " never - say - die spirit " and " determination " is not unique to @entity0 , either			1
it 's in all of us , everywhere			0

despite a *shrinking* population , @entity0 are still making their lives in the city
african - american art and culture are *thriving* in @entity0
pop - up *restaurants* and a unique local sport keep things *interesting*
