-- @entity1 are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas , according to a new report			1
@entity1 spend a little less time in traffic , a study shows , but drivers on @entity10 in @entity11 might not notice			1
rising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion , according to a study issued wednesday by the @entity18 , the nation 's largest university - based transportation research facility			1
" it 's temporary , but real , " said institute spokesman @entity22 about the declines			0
" as goes the @entity1 economy , so goes traffic			1
there 's fewer people going to work			0
" the institute attributed the changes to the recession , but the @entity1 economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007			1
the organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982 , and by " every measure , congestion has increased substantially " in those 25 years , the latest @entity35 said			1
researchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the @entity1 and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline			1
congestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours			2
in 2005 , that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours			0
but it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007 , representing a " rare break in near - constant growth , " the report said			2
because the changes were nominal , most people may not have noticed any change in their commutes			0
the average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day , @entity22 said			2
" things were so congested and bad , it was kind of hard to notice , " @entity22 said			0
among the report 's other findings : @entity1 travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush - hour traffic jams			1
that amounts to nearly one full work ( or vacation ) week for every traveler			0
the overall cost , based on wasted fuel and lost productivity , reached $ 87.3 billion in 2007 , the report said			0
that 's more than $ 750 per person			0
the amount of wasted fuel , from sitting idle with the motor running , topped 2.8 billion gallons , or three weeks ' worth of gas , for every traveler			0
congestion has slowed but , said the report 's authors , that means only that things are getting worse slower , " hardly a positive goal statement			1
" the @entity35 database includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- northeastern states in the early 1980s , @entity90 in the mid- 1980s , @entity91 in the early 1990s			0
in every case , when the economy rebounded , so did the congestion problem , the report said			2
that means congestion trends are likely to swing upward once the economy starts picking up			1
@entity1 might then have fatter pocketbooks , but they 'll go back to staring through their windshields a bit longer			2
@entity0 's @entity102 contributed to this report .			0

@entity18 finds @entity1 spent one less hour stuck in traffic in 2007
@entity109 , costly gas makes 2007 first year since 1982 trend has slowed
congestion down , authors say , but it " means things are getting worse slower "
study : once economy gets better , long waits in traffic will get worse
