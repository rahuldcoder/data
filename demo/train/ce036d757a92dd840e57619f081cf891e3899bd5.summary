@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 prime minister @entity3 was under mounting criticism on tuesday over his perceived casual attitude towards soldiers killed in @entity8 as support for the mission collapses			1
attacks over equipment shortages for @entity4 troops in @entity8 , his failure to bow at a war memorial , and his misspellings in a condolence letter to a soldier 's grieving mother all led one commentator to ask : " ca n't @entity3 do anything right ? " the @entity8 and military issues dominated the @entity4 prime minister 's monthly news conference at 10 @entity26 on tuesday , taking up 40 of the 50 minutes he spent at the lectern			1
@entity3 stated over and over his sympathy for the families of fallen troops and his determination to see the war effort through			1
" each life lost is an irreplaceable loss from a family , " @entity3 said			2
" it reminds us all of the stark human cost of armed conflict in the service of our society			0
" the latest embarrassment for the prime minister emerged monday , when @entity46 newspaper told the story of @entity48 , who received the condolence letter from @entity3 after her 20 - year - old son was killed by a bomb in @entity8			1
@entity48 told the paper she was " so angry " that the hand - written letter was filled with spelling errors -- including her own last name , which @entity3 spelled " @entity56			1
" @entity3 also crossed out a mistake in spelling the soldier 's name and spelled four other words wrong , the newspaper said			1
" the letter was scrawled so quickly i could hardly even read it and some of the words were half - finished			0
it 's just disrespectful , " she told @entity46 " he said , ' i know words can offer little comfort			0
' when the words are written in such a hurry the letter is littered with more than 20 mistakes , they offer no comfort			0
" @entity3 called @entity48 to apologize after the article appeared , according to @entity72 recorded the conversation and gave it to the paper , which recently announced on its front page that it was dropping support for @entity3 's @entity78 in favor of the conservatives			1
the paper printed a transcript and published the audio tuesday ; in it , @entity48 tells @entity3 that the letter was an " insult " to her son and that the spelling mistakes were " disrespectful			1
" the prime minister says in the conversation that he had only " good intentions " and sympathy for the mother 's loss			2
" the last thing on my mind was to cause any offense to @entity48 , and i think people know me well enough to know that it would never be my intention -- by carelessness or by failure -- to cause any grief to a grieving mother , " @entity3 said at the news conference tuesday			1
just two days earlier , some criticized @entity3 for another military gaffe -- not bowing his head when he laid a wreath at the @entity107 , the @entity0 military monument those who died in the two world wars , on @entity110			1
it was fodder for talk radio and @entity113 , where people debated whether it was intentional			0
" it 's disgusting because it is not respectful , " an unnamed former @entity116 serviceman told @entity117			0
some columnists seemed to forgive the prime minister for not nodding his head			0
" he attends @entity124 at the @entity107 looking solemn and dignified , black tie and poppy carefully in place , lays a wreath , steps back in thoughtful silence -- and is abused in the papers next day for failing to bow his head , " wrote @entity121 in @entity122			0
" if a politician lays a wreath at the @entity107 , it 's not an insult ; it 's an expression of respect			0
and forgetting to adjust your head a certain way indicates you have personal feelings and are n't just going through the motions			0
" the @entity142 's @entity141 suggested that @entity3 -- who is blind in one eye -- may have been " distracted by the difficulty of walking down the steps backwards " after he laid the wreath and simply forgot			1
but simply the fact that @entity3 was criticized for not bowing his head indicates how widely unpopular he has become , wrote @entity149 in the @entity150			1
" these so - called ' gaffes ' can be attributed to @entity3 's characteristic clumsiness and social dyslexia , " he wrote			1
" but they are magnified by both the unpopularity of the war and the ( prime minister ) himself			0
" @entity3 has already come under repeated criticism for the level of equipment for the 9,000 @entity4 troops in @entity8 , which some have said is too low			1
the prime minister has defended equipment levels and said he seeks assurances from military officers in the field that troops have the supplies they need			2
last week , @entity3 defended equipment levels in a major speech on @entity8			1
it followed the release days earlier of a military memo , sent in early june , from a @entity4 officer that warned a shortage of helicopters was putting @entity4 troops at risk because they were forced to travel on the ground , increasing the chances they could be killed by a roadside bomb			1
the memo was written by lt. col. @entity184 , who died a month later in a roadside bombing			0
he remains the highest - ranking @entity4 serviceman to die in combat since the 1982 @entity188			2
@entity48 brought the issue up in her recorded phone conversation with @entity3 , saying her son bled to death because there was no helicopter to take him for treatment			2
she said she had even had to buy military gear for her son to use -- something other military parents have said as well			0
" we have tried to provide the best equipment in the world , " @entity3 said tuesday			1
" we have increased the investment we have made in helicopters and in vehicles and in the equipping of the armed forces in a way that we have never done in our country before			0
" asked about @entity48 ' accusation that her son died because of a lack of helicopters , @entity3 said he had asked for a full report on all aspects of the guardsman 's death			2
" i am assured that in normal circumstances , there is always helicopter capability , " he said			0
tuesday was also the day that the bodies of six @entity4 soldiers killed in @entity8 returned to @entity4 , their coffins draped in the @entity223			1
five of them were killed in a single incident november 3 at a base in the southern province of @entity229 , when an @entity8 policeman they had been training fired on them			2
the @entity233 claimed responsibility for that attack			0
the somber day and the days of criticisms led @entity142 's @entity237 to write , " ca n't @entity3 do anything right ? " @entity239 , a media columnist for @entity142 , said no -- not because @entity3 is doing things wrong , but because the press gives him little slack			2
" @entity3 , it would appear , has no ally in the popular press , " @entity239 wrote			2
" he is being hung out to dry and it is painful to watch			0
i fear it will get even worse in the coming months			0
