the recent news that a group of highly respected medical experts , the @entity1 , is considering advising against routine prostate cancer screening should n't have come as too much of a surprise to anybody			1
indeed , the fact that so many people now are claiming to be surprised is an interesting story			0
many respected organizations that issue screening guidelines have for a long time expressed concern about the effectiveness and known risks of screening for prostate cancer			1
the list of groups that have expressed caution about widespread use of the prostate - specific antigen test , known as @entity23 , includes the @entity24 , the @entity25 , the @entity26 and the @entity27			2
here is the problem in a nutshell : widespread @entity23 screening began 20 years ago , amazingly , well before anyone bothered to initiate studies to find out whether such screening saves lives			1
because doctors and patients believed that screening works — was n't it obvious that it would ? — they opposed rigorous studies , called randomized trials , that assign half the patients to get screening while the other half goes unscreened			1
despite opposition from doctors and patients , the trials finally got done , and today the harms of screening are better proved than the benefits			1
a substantial number of men receive unnecessary treatment , as their cancers are so slow - growing they are not life - threatening			0
these treatments commonly lead to harms such as impotence and incontinence and can even lead to premature death			2
this , while the benefits -- the number of lives saved -- are very small at best , nonexistent at worst			2
alas , the history of medicine is filled with examples of physicians jumping the gun , acting in a manner unsupported by evidence , even ignoring the words of caution in the " evidence - based guidelines " promulgated by their own professional societies			2
i am convinced that most advocates of screening and aggressive treatment are motivated by genuine desire to benefit men			0
unfortunately , they are uninformed or unwilling to believe the reality that early detection and aggressive treatment of cancer is not always the best thing			0
for two decades , some supporters of prostate cancer screening , even some so - called experts , have overstated , exaggerated and , in some cases , misled the public about the evidence supporting its effectiveness			1
they downplayed or failed to mention the risks of screening and misapplied and misstated basic principles of cancer screening			2
with evangelical fervor , true believers conducted mass screening in shopping malls , at state fairs and in supermarket parking lots			0
screening has been sponsored by medical practices , hospitals , drug and medical device companies , politicians and even manufacturers of adult diapers			0
most of these sponsors wanted to do a public service , but many profited from it			0
some may also have been blinded by that profit			0
the phenomenon of so - called experts , who do not understand basic principles of screening , making exaggerated statements is not limited to prostate cancer			2
it also occurs in breast and lung cancer screening			2
well - designed scientific study has clearly showed that these procedures save lives , but science has also demonstrated that the procedures have limitations and risks of harm			0
the @entity1 , an independent board of experts in interpretation of medical evidence , convened by the @entity138 @entity139 , sanctioned true screening experts to review and assess every published scientific study concerning prostate cancer screening			1
this recently published review is very reasonable			0
it recognizes that the few studies that suggest that prostate screening saves lives are undermined by biases and inconsistencies			1
of course , the studies that did not show a benefit to screening also have flaws			1
however , all studies consistently show that significant harms are associated with screening and the sometimes unnecessary treatment			1
ironically , the @entity1 recommendation is n't too far apart from that of the @entity159 , which represents most of the doctors who diagnose and treat prostate cancer			0
the association 's 2009 publication titled " @entity164 " reads : " given the uncertainty that @entity23 testing results in more benefit than harm , a thoughtful and broad approach to @entity23 is critical			1
patients need to be informed of the risks and benefits of testing before it is undertaken			1
the risks of overdetection and overtreatment should be included in this discussion			0
" while the @entity1 statement is wise and reasonable , there is risk that the pendulum will swing too far			0
a move against all use of the @entity23 tests in screening and diagnostics would be unfortunate			1
the @entity1 review does see some benefit to prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment			0
guarded use of @entity23 testing as a diagnostic tool in select individuals within the physician - patient relation is reasonable and consistent with the @entity138 @entity198 statement			1
some outspoken clinician advocates of screening need to understand that complexity			0
we need balanced , truthful information widely available to physicians and patients			0
sadly , the overselling and overpromise of screening technology in cancer and other diseases harms patients and — justifiably -- weakens trust in the medical profession			1
it also adds to the unnecessarily high cost of health care , which is already threatening the health of the @entity138 economy			2
more than anything , the battle over prostate cancer screening raises a disturbing question : are we as a society prepared to pay attention to scientific evidence ?			1

@entity138 *preventive* services panel is considering advising against routine @entity23 screening
dr. @entity230 says screening began before evidence of whether it saves lives
studies show that routine @entity23 testing 's harms are better proved than the benefits
