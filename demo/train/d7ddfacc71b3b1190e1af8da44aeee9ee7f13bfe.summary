-- @entity1 last talked to his son @entity2 , the outdoors enthusiast who took up his father 's firefighting profession , on the phone just hours before @entity2 died			1
" he said , ' @entity9 , we got a fire in @entity11 , @entity12			1
... i 'll give you a call later , ' " the elder @entity1 told " @entity16 " on monday			2
@entity1 is having a hard time accepting that he wo n't get that return call			1
@entity19 , 21 , was one of 19 members of an elite @entity12 firefighting unit who died sunday while battling the @entity23 wildfire , which has consumed more than 8,400 acres northwest of @entity24			1
the deaths are under investigation , but officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under fire shelters , blankets meant to protect against flames and heat , as a last resort against an inferno that overwhelmed them			2
@entity19 , following in the footsteps of his father , a @entity38 fire captain , joined the @entity40 's @entity39 just three months ago , @entity1 said			1
for hotshot firefighters , no such thing as a routine wildfire he appeared suited for a hotshot crew , a group of top - shelf wildfire battlers who are called to get close to the blaze , dig barriers and clear out the brush and other material that otherwise would fuel it			2
" @entity53 wanted to be a fireman			2
sleeping in the dirt was not a big deal to him ; he actually enjoyed it , i think , " @entity1 said , remembering a son who always had a fishing rod in his car			1
" just a great kid , not a mean bone in his body ... always looking forward to becoming a firefighter like his dad			1
" words ca n't describe the loss that our family is feeling right now			0
" @entity19 was n't the only firefighter 's son in the @entity74 crew			1
@entity75 , 30 , was the son of @entity76 , a retired captain for the @entity77			2

" it 's a younger man 's game , " @entity99 fire chief @entity98 told reporters monday			1
" these people keep themselves in exceptional condition			0
they have considerable weight to carry , and they walk ( miles ) to get to strategic locations			0
" the physical challenge appealed to @entity82 , a father and husband who wanted to be a firefighter since middle school			1
@entity82 " wanted to do hotshot work until he physically no longer could do it " and trained feverishly , said his mother , @entity112			1
deployed for the summer , the group missed their families but enjoyed the camaraderie , @entity112 told @entity0 on monday			0
" they loved each other			0
it was almost a band of brothers			0
these guys ate together , they slept on the ground together when they were fighting fires , these were his comrades , " she said			0
the group 's website speaks to their fitness : " environmental extremes , long hours , bad food , and steep , rugged terrain , demand that we train early and often by running and hiking , doing core exercises , yoga , and weight training			0
" @entity1 said his son " wanted to be in the weeds , because i started out as a wildland firefighter			1
" " he worked out as a cross country runner , ( but ) he did n't even excel in running until he graduated from high school , because he knew the hotshot thing , you had to be the best , " he said			2
now , the elder @entity1 says he and his wife feel stuck in a sleepless nightmare , coming to terms with their loss			2
" my wife and i and our daughter and my other son have kind of sheltered ourselves from the exact incident , " he said			0
" when the time is right , we 'll dig in and figure out exactly what happened			0
