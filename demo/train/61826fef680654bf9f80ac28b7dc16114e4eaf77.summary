-- imagine this : in your hot little hands you hold a blueprint for a luxury hotel in one of the most idyllic -- and tiny -- locations in the world			2
there 's just one problem -- there 's no space to build the thing			0
the answer ? create a five - star yacht hotel			1
that 's exactly the thinking behind @entity19 's new $ 200 million @entity18 ; a permanently moored vessel which could spell the future of architecture in land scarce cities around the world			1
" in @entity19 there 's a huge demand for hotels , but how do you do it in such a small jurisdiction ? " @entity19 ceo , @entity32 , told @entity0			2
" unlike traditional building -- which involves trucks , cranes and a huge amount of disruption -- we have a ready built product that can be delivered to these prime areas			0
" ship - shape the mammoth 142 - meter superyacht will rest its anchor in @entity19 's @entity44 , located off the southern tip of @entity46 , with plans to open its doors to the public by the end of this year			1
boasting 189 rooms , spa and gym , cocktail lounges , conference rooms , and even a ballroom , the luxury liner will be one of the grandest structures in the @entity60			1
at seven storeys tall , the vessel will dwarf nearby yachts in the marina , with rooms expected to cost between $ 300 and $ 3,000 per night			1
plug in , tune out the whopping boat , originally built in @entity68 , will be attached to the dock via six superstrong hydraulic arms , each weighing eight tons			0
guests will enter through an enclosed glass bridge and @entity32 says once on board " they will feel no different to being in a five - star hotel on land			1
" " it 's intriguing that something so large can literally just be plugged in to a port , " he added			0
" we will have enormous power cables safely secured underground			0
" small territory , big ambition measuring just 6.8 square kilometres , the @entity86 territory of @entity19 is a small state packing a big punch			2
much like @entity89 or @entity90 , @entity19 is a sunny tourist destination with a thriving economy -- yet lacks the space for urban development			0
that 's where the @entity96 comes in , with @entity32 saying it could pave the way for similar vessels across the world -- and even be used at temporary events such as the @entity102 or @entity103			2
coming to a city near you ? @entity19 follows the company 's first yacht hotel -- the " @entity110 " -- which was moored at @entity108 in @entity109 in 2002			1
there are now plans to anchor similar floating hotels in @entity113 and @entity114			1
but with each contract usually spanning 10 years , @entity32 says its unlikely the vessels will be doing much cruising once they 're in place			0
and if @entity96 is on the right track , the most successful boats could be those which never even set sail .			0

with land at a *premium* , property developers *increasingly* turn to floating hotels
introducing @entity19 's new $ 200 million @entity96
five - star hotel a whopping seven storeys tall , boasting 189 rooms , luxury *facilities*
follows similar yacht hotel in @entity109 , with plans for vessels in @entity113 and @entity114
