" i wanted to build a good future for my family , but i failed , " a weak @entity0 said in a videotaped statement			0
the refugee from the @entity6 region of @entity7 was trying to illegally cross the border from @entity9 to @entity10 when he was discovered and shot by @entity9 border guards			1
less than an hour after taping the statement , @entity0 was dead , succumbing to the wounds inflicted by the gunshots			0
every year , thousands of refugees , mostly from @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity7 , attempt the dangerous journey from their war - torn countries to @entity10 in search of economic prosperity and stability			1
very few make it , and the results of the failed migration can be seen in the morgue of the central hospital in the @entity9 port town of @entity29			1
when a @entity32 crew visited there recently , all the refrigeration units were broken , leaving a biting stench of decaying corpses in the air , which staff members attempted in vain to cover up with chlorine - based cleaner and incense			2
on any given day , the morgue will be packed with the bodies of @entity43 refugees who died trying to make it to @entity10			1
@entity45 spends a lot of time here as head of the @entity49 , which tries to help @entity43 refugees in @entity9			1
every week , @entity45 combs the desert , searching for corpses , ensuring that they get a dignified burial			1
he has spent the past seven years helping the refugees			2
many are enslaved and tortured and the women raped by the @entity58 tribes of the @entity59 if they are unable to come up with large sums of money the @entity58 try to extort from them and their families , to smuggle the refugees across the border into @entity10			1
as a result , many remain imprisoned in camps on the @entity68			0
" they are chained and kept in camps in the open with no bathrooms and little water and food and treated worse than animals , " @entity45 said			0
" some of them are taken to @entity75 , but 80 % of them are smuggled to @entity10			1
those who escape are shot by the @entity78 , and others who make it to the border are sometimes shot by the @entity9 authorities and transferred to hospitals before spending a year in different prisons in @entity59 and deported back home			1
" the @entity32 crew found two victims in the hospital in @entity29 , handcuffed to their beds and awaiting their transfer to an @entity9 detention center and eventual deportation			1
one of them , @entity93 of @entity15 , says he hit his head falling off a rock while trying to cross the border and was caught by @entity9 border guards			1
but before making it to the border , @entity93 says , he spent about two months with the @entity78			0
" they beat and tortured me continuously and demanded money from my family , " @entity93 said			2
@entity45 says this is a common scheme			0
the refugees will pay @entity58 tribes in the border area between @entity7 and @entity9 around $ 2,000 to be smuggled out			1
the smugglers then sell the refugees to the @entity58 , who blackmail the refugees and their families back home			1
@entity113 of @entity15 says he fell prey to the @entity58			1
" when we arrived to @entity59 , the @entity78 tied me up with metal chains in the desert			1
many of us died , " he said , displaying his wounds , including scars that he says came from electroshock torture			0
" they wanted me to pay $ 12,000 and forced us to call our families to transfer the money			0
my family sold all their lands and even their donkey to collect the money			0
they transferred $ 6,000 to the @entity78			0
" after his family paid , @entity113 says , the @entity58 finally let him go			2
" i spent three months tied up in the camp close to the @entity10 border			2
after i paid , the @entity78 drove me to the border crossing and set me free			0
i was then shot by plainclothes men close to the wired fence at the @entity10 - @entity9 border			1
the military took me to the hospital			0
" some of the refugees are forced into slave labor , often working marijuana fields that flourish all over @entity59 , @entity140 says			1
refugees who made it across the border into @entity10 have told harrowing accounts of rape , torture and slave labor			1
@entity32 spoke to one victim who made it to @entity10 and spoke on condition of anonymity			2
she said she was raped almost daily on a journey that took several months to get to @entity158			2
" every night , they took me separately , and they did whatever they wanted to my body , " the @entity15 said			0
@entity45 hears stories like this all the time			0
" the women and men are kept in open areas			2
these bedouins do n't have any morals or conscience			0
one girl told me that three @entity78 had raped 14 girls in one night , " he said			0
when @entity32 confronted a leader of the @entity178 tribe , one of the largest in @entity59 , the chief said he was aware that people trafficking is going on in @entity59 and that in some cases @entity43 refugees are held in bonded labor , tortured and women raped			1
the @entity185 chief , who did not want to be named for this report , said that only rogue elements of the tribe are involved in people trafficking			0
this same chief took @entity32 to a secret location and allowed them to speak to five @entity43 refugees who were hoping to make it to @entity10 , in an apparent bid to show us that the refugees were being well treated			1
but interviews with refugees who have escaped the camps or been released suggest that mistreatment and even murder are commonplace in the @entity58 camps			1
one @entity58 leader willing to go on record is called @entity205 , a powerful chief of the @entity208 tribe			2
he acknowledges that people trafficking exists among members of the @entity208 and @entity212 tribes , but he says that it is only a fraction of the members who are involved in the trade and that they are ruthless			0
" you ca n't label the whole tribe or implicate it in this trade			0
the bedouins in @entity59 are over 150,000			2
those working in this business will not exceed more than 50 people			0
" during an interview by the @entity225 , @entity205 said he loathes those involved in people trafficking , torture , rape and murder			0
but he acknowledges that @entity58 leaders are doing little to stop the illicit business out of fear of stoking tribal infighting			2
" these guys are evil			0
they do not care where to get money			0
they deal with a middleman in @entity43 to get those men			2
these @entity43 spend months here , sometimes up to six months in @entity59 , before crossing -- if they cross			1
" @entity9 's government and armed forces seem powerless to stop the @entity58 smugglers			1
police units have been forced out of most areas in @entity248 after the revolution that swept longtime leader @entity250 from power			0
a military operation aimed at combating @entity254 extremists in the area has done little to stop people trafficking in this lawless region that runs mostly on criminal activity , such as smuggling of goods into @entity261 and drug trafficking			0
meanwhile , more bodies turn up in the @entity59 desert			1
in a matter of weeks , several more were buried by @entity140 close to the grave of @entity0 , the refugee from @entity6 who recorded a video shortly before his death			0
while the bodies of those who can be identified are buried in cemeteries in @entity29 , the many corpses that remain nameless -- because they carry no identity cards or have decomposed beyond recognition -- are laid to rest outside the cemetery walls in an anonymous mass grave under heaps of trash from an adjacent slum .			1

every year , thousands attempt dangerous journey from @entity43 countries to @entity10
few make it ; many bodies of *unsuccessful* refugees lie in morgue in @entity29 , @entity9
one man combs desert searching for corpses , ensuring they get dignified burial
many refugees are enslaved and tortured ; women are raped by @entity58 tribes of @entity59
