@entity0 -- @entity2 committed a classic @entity4 gaffe on @entity1 's " @entity5 " this past sunday -- he told the truth			1
when asked about his criticism of @entity8 back in 2008 , @entity2 explained that it was a campaign contrast influenced by ego , but admitted that at the time he was comparing " my far superior record to his otherwise - decent record			1
" surrogates are n't supposed to toot their own horn			2
they 're supposed to loudly recite the party line			0
but @entity2 is an independent - minded kind of guy and when asked a direct question , he answered			1
the reason that @entity2 had a better record in office than @entity8 is actually pretty simple -- he worked at it in @entity0 nonstop for eight years			1
in contrast , @entity8 was @entity26 from @entity27 much of the time when he was governor			1
under @entity2 's leadership in @entity0 , crime and welfare rolls were cut in half , ahead of national trends			1
as the quality of life improved , so did the local economy -- with businesses and families reversing a decades - long exodus			0
on the fiscal conservative front , @entity2 excelled as well , cutting or eliminating 23 different taxes while reducing the rate of spending below the rate of inflation plus population			2
i 'm biased here to the extent that i served as @entity2 's chief speechwriter in @entity51 and deputy policy director in his 2008 campaign			2
but as another esteemed @entity0 political leader , sen. @entity54 , once said , " everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but not their own facts			0
" @entity2 remains controversial , but his record by the numbers is not a matter of opinion -- it is a matter of fact			1
@entity8 's record in @entity27 is more limited because he was only in office for one term and halfway through that period he started laying the groundwork to run for president			1
@entity8 is running on executive experience , but it is as a businessman and turnaround artist -- not as chief executive of @entity27 , the only government leadership position he has ever held			1
there 's no question @entity8 accumulated an impressive record as the innovative founding executive at @entity80 , and he deserves a lot of credit for turning around the @entity83			1
but his record of accomplishment in government is much more limited and far less innovative			0
his ceo approach to dealing with the @entity90 - dominated legislature fell flat			0
and after assuming the chairmanship of the @entity92 for the 2006 mid-term elections , he spent two - thirds of his time out of state			0
so it 's not a surprise that he declined to run for re-election as governor ; instead , he announced he would run for president in 2008			1
this is a straightforward recital of the facts -- a more detailed portrait of his time in @entity27 can be found in the essential book " @entity107 , " written by two @entity109 reporters , @entity110 and @entity111			2
but suffice it to say that @entity8 is a very goal - oriented guy , and after achieving the governorship , he set his sights quickly on the next challenge -- the one that had eluded his beloved father -- the presidency			2
the central achievement of @entity8 's government career in @entity27 was the mandate - driven health care reform he now tries to ignore but which he once touted by saying that " an achievement like this comes once in a generation			1
" he even chose the bill to appear in his official state portrait			0
the plan was n't just a signature achievement , it was considered a political asset in running to succeed president @entity131			2
the country was tired of polarization , and @entity8 could provide a problem - solving antidote , a demonstrated ability to bring a @entity92 solution -- the individual mandate -- to a problem that @entity139 traditionally cared most about			1
it was an approach entirely consistent with the way he campaigned for office in 2002 and also consistent with the @entity144 political philosophy established by his father , @entity145 , when he was an effective and popular governor of @entity146 in the 1960s			0
risking re-election was also deemed to be a political loser			0
if he ran and lost , his presidential ambitions would be toast			0
that 's why @entity8 was the last in 16 years of @entity92 governors for stereotypically liberal @entity27			1
the trend was set by centrist @entity155 after he succeeded @entity156 in 1990 and extended by @entity157			0
but @entity8 pretty much buried that trend and did n't even try to extend it back in 2006			1
he was n't a trailblazer as much as a trail - ender in this regard			0
but the biggest tell was the now infamous 180 on social issues he had pledged to defend while trying to get elected in the first place			0
in july of 2005 , he penned an op - ed in the @entity109 saying that his " convictions have evolved and deepened during my time as governor " -- the once staunch defender of a woman 's right to choose began describing himself as " firmly pro-life " just in time to hit the national conservative circuit			0
likewise , his commitment to advance " full equality " for gays and lesbians quickly fell by the wayside			0
ditto past statements on guns , greenhouse gases , abstinence education and immigration			0
these are politically pragmatic decisions when someone is planning to run for the @entity92 nomination , but they are not the actions of a conviction politician			0
in contrast , @entity188 and @entity2 -- two of @entity8 's rivals in 2008 -- are quintessential conviction politicians			1
they put real stock in concepts of honor when it comes to the political arena , and it often gets them in trouble			0
it would have been far easier for @entity2 to reframe his position on abortion or adjust his rhetoric to the right on guns , gays or immigration			2
but @entity2 's not that kind of guy			2
@entity8 's missing record in @entity27 reflects the fact that he treated that executive office as a launching pad for his presidential ambitions			1
and it is an irony of presidential politics that the signature health care bill he intended to used as evidence of his political vision became a liability from which he had to distance himself four years later			1
the quintessential turnaround artist when it comes to business , he never really attempted a turnaround of @entity27			2
instead , his inattention helped end 16 years of @entity92 gubernatorial rule			0
that is , unfortunately for @entity8 , also a matter of record			1
as the technocrat candidate is fond of saying , " facts are stubborn things			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			2

@entity2 drew contrasts between his record and that of @entity8
@entity236 says @entity2 did n't help @entity8 but did tell the truth
@entity236 : @entity8 chose not to run for re-election , neglected @entity27
he says former governor has *abandoned* his top achievement , the health care mandate
