-- prepare yourself for the @entity2			1
@entity3 surprised the crowd at the end of the @entity7 panel at @entity8 to reveal this as the title and main character of @entity12 2			1
we 'll get to that			1
but first the @entity7 crew ran down all the major titles coming up , including new details on " @entity18 : @entity19 , " " captain america : the winter soldier , " and " @entity22			1
" see complete comic - con coverage here 's how it happened : the @entity8 panel begins : @entity27 president @entity26 is introduced as " the master of nerd puppetry " by moderator @entity30			1
asked what he has in the works , @entity26 says : " well , we have a movie called @entity18 : @entity19			1
" a cavernous boom ! and then total darkness as the billboard - sized screen in 6,000 - seat @entity39 goes blank			1
" humanity ... look how far you 've fallen			1
lining up in the heat ... chattering together in the dark ... like beasts ! ! ! " aaand lightning flash as @entity45 appears in character as @entity47			1
@entity18 : the @entity19 " stand back , you mewling quim ! " he declares			1
and everyone falls down in fealty , cheering			1
" you should have let me rule you when you had the chance			1
" @entity45 , er , @entity47 unleashes an @entity56 - style @entity55 routine , insulting the miserable mass of humanity before him			1
then asks : " say my name ? " @entity60 ! ! ! the crowd roars " @entity63 ! " he says , no longer asking			1
the crowd chants : @entity60 ... ! @entity60 ... ! @entity60 ...			1
! @entity45 smiles : " then i have an army			1
" a clip of " thor : @entity19 " begins to play , showing @entity69 's hammer - swinging hero in an epic , galactic battle			1
at one point , @entity73 's character appears to slap @entity47			1
" that was for @entity76 , " she says			2
the clip ends and bow power has been restored			2
@entity26 begins introducing the cast of ... see stars ' comic - con self - portraits @entity82 : the winter soldier nearly the full cast of the winter soldier gathers ( minus @entity86 and a few other key parts ) , and @entity88 is asked if @entity82 is finally adjusting to modern life			1
" it 's not like he 's shocked by , ' oh wow , the @entity91 ! ' " @entity88 says			2
" but today it 's harder to know who is right and who 's wrong			2
" is @entity96 's @entity95 a cameo or a major role ? @entity26 says " she and @entity30 share this movie in a big way			2
" we get to see how she is in a more casual working relationship , " @entity96 says			2
" it starts to break down the barriers of the walls she has put up			2
this film is gritty and has some down and dirty bare - knuckle fighting			2
" @entity88 says @entity82 and @entity95 have an " odd couple " relationship , coming from very different attitudes about what is right and wrong			1
there 's still a week left before shooting is complete , but @entity7 is presenting a clip			2
here 's the recap : unknown thugs gather in an elevator and @entity82 can tell something is wrong			1
one of them is @entity123 as the villain @entity125			2
" before we start , " @entity82 says			1
" anyone want to get out ? " a face - crushing fistfight breaks out , and all fall except crossbones			2
" i just want you to know , @entity82			1
none of this is personal , " he says			2
" it kinda feels personal , " @entity82 says , and the battle continues			1
" to build a better world sometimes means tearing the wold one down , " says @entity86 's voice			2
he appears against a large window , @entity138 , " disorder , war , all it takes is one step			2
" now @entity144 's @entity143 speaka : " we 're going to neutralize a lot of threats before they happen			2
" " i thought the punishment usually came after the crime , " @entity82 says			1
" @entity151 sees the world as it is , not as we hope it to be , " @entity143 replies			2
the last shot is @entity156 's winter soldier , picking up @entity82 's fallen shield			1
@entity22 next , @entity26 reveals that the upcoming space saga @entity22 has just started shooting in the @entity159 and wanted to come to @entity8			1
" so they decided to come ... ! " here 's a rundown of who is who in the cast : @entity164 -- @entity165 , playing a galactic big - game hunter and founding member of the @entity22			2
nebula -- @entity169 — the chrome - domed mercenary and supervillain			2
" i might have done something a little bit crazy , " she says and pulls off a wig to reveal her shaved head			0
@entity176 — @entity177 , as a leader of the evil alien race known as the @entity180			0
korath the @entity181 -- @entity182 , an affiliate of the @entity180 who is allied with @entity176			0
the collector — @entity186 , playing an ancient being who gathers lifeforms from around the galaxy to keep as his own			0
@entity191 the destroyer -- @entity196 , " when i go the job , i broke down and cried like a little baby , " the physically massive pro wrestler said			0
" i 'm 44 years old , i 'm the baby on the set in terms of acting experience			0
i go to work every day and try to learn something new			0
" @entity201 — @entity206 , as the emerald - hued alien assassin who is the adopted daughter of one of the most evil beings in the universe : @entity207			0
" i 've done blue , i figured why not try green ? " @entity208 — @entity209 , on his new ripped physique : " i had a tapeworm			0
" his character is a half - human , half - alien who never fit in on @entity215 , and has n't really found a place for himself anywhere else in the galaxy either			0
even though the film has only been shooting a short time , @entity7 completed some special effects for a short teaser reel			0
it begins with ... a large crypt - like door opening — vaguely futuristic and vaguely ancient			0
it 's @entity209 as @entity208 walking into what appears to be temple , claiming an artifact in a sort - of recreation of @entity229 of the @entity230 but @entity182 's @entity231 stops him			0
no problem at all , " @entity208 says , hardly brave			0
he identifies himself as @entity208 , which makes @entity231 go : " who ? " " @entity208 , man ! legendary outlaw ? forget it			0
" then , although we do n't see any of @entity186 's @entity241 ( he has n't shot any scenes yet ) we ironically get a scene reminiscent of the line - up from @entity245			0
each of the @entity22 is standing behind a one - way mirror in a futuristic mug - shot situation as @entity250 's galactic lawman @entity249 gives the rundown : @entity191 the destroyer flexes and scowls , a big green mean looking gent , ripped with red markings			0
@entity201 — he id 's the assassin as death - craving villain @entity207 ' adopted daughter			0
we see a short , fuzzy , bandit - looking creature ( who does n't speak — sorry , still no casting there			0
) " he calls himself @entity264 , " @entity250 says			0
" wanted on over fifty charges of vehicular theft " groot , the tree warrior is shown — although he is so large his face is above the frame and we only see his trunk			0
" he 's been traveling recently as a personal houseplant - slash - muscle , " @entity250 says			0
" @entity273 , also known as @entity208			0
he 's wanted largely on charges of minor assault			0
" they call themselves the @entity22 , " @entity250 says			0
" what a bunch of a-holes			0
" cue the music as " @entity281 chocka ooga ooga ooga chocka " begins to play , " and @entity285 's " hooked on a feeling " ( @entity208 's jam ) plays through some quick flashes of spaceships and galactic carnage			0
finally , the big finish ... the @entity12 : age of @entity2 @entity3 arrives to reveal that @entity289 will be called ... age of @entity2 ! crowd			1
for those who do n't follow the comic book world as closely , a little background is in order			0
@entity295 was a sentient robot who was the creation of a scientist named dr. @entity299 — also known as @entity300 , which means @entity12 2 will likely introduce the hero of @entity304 's upcoming @entity7 movie			0
@entity2 is self - aware and develops a craving for power , according to comics lore			1
he begins rebuilding himself into more and more powerful iterations and seeks to create artificial life himself in a twisted desire to become a parent — especially important since he eventually wars with his own " father , " @entity299			0
but ... the curious thing about the footage @entity3 presented to introduce the @entity2 title is that it begins with a close - up of what appears to be @entity322 's mask			1
we hear various lines various @entity12 that were spoken in previous @entity7 movies			0
as they speak , the @entity322 helmet spins and is scratched , dented , and pulverized			0
it is transforming , and at the end we see a pullback and the title reveal : @entity322 's mask has become @entity2 's grinning , fang - like metallic skull			1
so will @entity299 actually not be part of @entity295 's story ? might we see @entity7 retcon this bit of lore to make @entity322 the creator of @entity2			1
( hey , he has the almost - sentient artificial intelligence @entity341 to help him			0
he 's close ! ) @entity3 offered no clues			1
but @entity2 was also the name of an apocalyptic series of comics by @entity346 that was published this year , featuring the robot villain taking over the entire planet and leaving it in ruins , while superheroes turn refugee and hide away while plotting a counter-attack			1
( there 's a lot more to it than that , and casual fans may want to seek out the book asap before spoilers proliferate in @entity12 2 news reports			0
) one thing is certain — the movie ca n't be totally faithful to the books , which prominently feature @entity364 and @entity365 , among other heroes that are licensed to other studios			0
but we 'll find out more as we near the release date : may 1 , 2015			0
@entity18 : @entity19 opens nov. 8			1
@entity82 : the winter soldier is due in theaters april 4 , 2014			1
