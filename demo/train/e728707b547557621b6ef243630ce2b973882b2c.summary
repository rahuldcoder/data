@entity9 's @entity8 was once regarded as a lock for re-election , but now could lose her seat			1
@entity13 ( @entity2 ) -- two years ago , as the 2007 - 2008 election cycle was beginning , one female @entity15 senator up for re-election looked to be in serious danger : @entity19 's @entity18			1
but with just three weeks left until @entity21 , the moderate @entity20 now appears to be one of the few embattled @entity15 senators who could survive the forthcoming @entity25 wave			0
on the other hand , @entity9 's @entity8 , once regarded as a lock for re-election , looks as if she is about to fall at the hands of @entity25 challenger @entity30			1
how did @entity8 become more endangered than @entity20 ? first , @entity20 ' campaign understood from the beginning that her opponent , 1st district democratic congressman @entity33 , would be a formidable foe			2
@entity33 , a former mayor of @entity36 , already represents half of the state , and he has the kind of earnest , low - key style that appeals to many @entity19 voters			2
second , @entity20 understood that she 'd get no help from the top of the ticket this year , so she had to raise money and get her message out early			0
most neutral observers have expected the eventual @entity25 nominee for president to carry @entity19 this year , since @entity52 carried the state by 5 percentage points in 2000 and @entity55 won it by 9 percentage points four years ago			2
third , for whatever reason , @entity20 has , over the 12 years that she has represented the state in the @entity60 , developed considerable affection and respect from @entity19 voters , who see her as independent , hard - working and down to earth			1
it has been that bond with state voters that has allowed her to weather the current storm that is overwhelming other @entity15 incumbents			2
@entity8 , on the other hand , seemed not to appreciate the threat she faced			1
@entity30 , after all , was not the initially - preferred candidate of the @entity74 , and the @entity25 state senator from @entity76 had first ruled out a bid against @entity8 before eventually changing her mind			1
@entity8 also apparently had trouble accepting that she was vulnerable			0
her early poll numbers were strong , after all			0
but the @entity74 spent heavily to attack @entity8 early , and they succeeded in softening her up			0
they also hit her on two good issues : her effectiveness ( or lack of it ) in @entity13 and the little time that she has spent in the state over the past few years			0
finally , @entity25 presidential nominee @entity88 is running better in the @entity90 state than most expected , so @entity8 is n't getting any kind of bump from the presidential race			1
voters seem more interested in voting for change than for the more conservative candidate in the presidential and @entity60 races , and that has made @entity8 a seriously endangered incumbent			1
@entity20 ca n't yet take her re-election for granted , and @entity30 's victory is not yet certain			0
but @entity18 appreciated her vulnerability early on and took steps to strengthen her chances for re-election , while @entity8 was slower to react and was weaker in her positioning than she initially believed .			2

@entity8 , once considered a lock for re-election , now seen as likely to lose
@entity8 seemed not to appreciate threat she faced in @entity60 campaign , **writers** say
@entity88 's good run in state means less of a bump for @entity8
@entity15 senator in @entity19 worked harder to combat her vulnerability , **writers** say
