-- lower your expectations enough and any roadside attraction is a good excuse to stretch your legs , lose a couple bucks , and see a genuine slice of @entity8 you 'll likely never visit again			1
but some of these destinations have become kitsch institutions			1
you might even make a trip just to see them			1
or at least you wo n't regret adding the extra time to your journey			1
@entity17 and other natural oddities @entity19 , @entity20 some people use churches , sidewalks or subway cars			1
@entity25 chose to build a 50 - foot technicolor adobe mountain in the desert of @entity20 in order to spread his message that " @entity31 is @entity32			1
" @entity33 passed away on monday at age 82 , according to the @entity35			1
for nearly three decades , @entity33 built the mountain out of adobe and hay , and he painted it with swerving colors and messages , with the hope of sharing that simple message in a big way			1
at least 50 people visit this giant example of outsider art each day			1
@entity33 used to greet visitors until he was hospitalized in 2011			1
a group of volunteers now maintain the site			2
paint donations are always welcome			2
www.salvationmountain.us @entity52 , @entity53 you 've seen the pictures on @entity57 's @entity56 and your trendy @entity60 friend 's @entity58			2
no , it 's not a @entity63 store			2
it 's not even in @entity65			2
the " store " is actually an art installation about a half - hour drive northwest of the small west @entity53 town that has become a pilgrimage destination for artists and hipsterati			2
the $ 80,000 sculpture was created by @entity74 in 2005			2
the art duo of @entity76 and @entity77 wanted to leave it alone forever so that it could decompose into the high desert surroundings , providing a commentary on materialism			1
but when vandals broke in and stole all the shoes three days after it was finished , the artists decided to make repairs and add video cameras			2
do n't worry -- you can still be as ridiculous as you want when you hold your photo shoot			2
@entity91 90 ; @entity92 , @entity53 @entity93 , @entity94 while we 've come to fear sinkholes , @entity93 is proof that they 're not all bad			1
( although we sure would n't have wanted to be walking over @entity94 's @entity98 around 30 million years ago			2
) located 1,120 feet underground , this 145 - foot waterfall -- one of the largest publicly accessible underground waterfalls -- was caused by this natural phenomenon			1
stalactites , stalagmites and other cave formations are also explained on the guided cave tours			2
tickets are $ 17.95 for adults , $ 9.95 for kids ages 3 to 12			2
@entity110 , @entity93 , @entity94 ; ( 423 ) 821 - 2544			1
@entity111 biosphere 2 @entity112 , @entity113 what , you did n't know that earth is @entity112 1 ? well , that 's what the developers of this gargantuan lab , known as @entity119 , in @entity112 , @entity113 , consider it			2
oil millionaire @entity122 funded the project hoping it would help us better understand how to colonize @entity126			0
the 3 - acre glass temple included a rainforest , ocean , corral reef , wetland and fog desert			1
seven scientists entered the bizarre ecosystem melting pot in 1991 for the first mission			0
for two years they ran experiments on how to sustain life in a contained environment and when they left two years later , the $ 151 million project was largely considered a failure			0
the team had extreme difficulty keeping themselves or the environment healthy			0
the @entity145 took over the property in 2011 and uses it for experiments and classes , and provides daily tours from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.			0
admission for adults is $ 20 ; $ 13 for children ages 6 to 12			0
32540 s biosphere road , @entity112 , @entity113 ; ( 520 ) 838 - 6192			0
@entity154 @entity155 , @entity20 no one is quite sure why @entity157 wanted the construction of her sprawling @entity160 mansion to go on as long as she lived			1
the most exciting theory is that she believed she was haunted by those killed by her husband 's invention , the @entity167 rifle , aka the gun that won the @entity169			0
apparently she thought she would keep these spirits away if she moved to @entity20 and never stopped building			1
men worked around the clock until her death in september 1922 , 38 years after breaking ground			0
the result is an @entity178 painting come to life -- stairs lead to nowhere , doors open to reveal walls			0
if ghosts did make it to her house , they would probably get lost on the way to her room			0
525 s. @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity20 ; ( 408 ) 247 - 2101 ; @entity194 @entity195 , @entity196 what does it take to become the country 's most famous remote roadside store ? free water			1
@entity203 's wife @entity202 came up with the idea in 1936 , five difficult years after he bought the store : put up signs offering ice cold water to the hot drivers on their way to @entity210			1
it did n't matter that most drug stores already provided this convenience			0
the idea worked , and now @entity215 receives about a million visitors a year			1
the humble store has grown to include a chapel , a western art museum , a department store and life - sized dinosaurs			0
but there 's still a water well out back for any parched passers - by			1
you 'll have a hard time missing the spot			0
if you 're driving on @entity228 through the state of @entity196 you 're sure to see one of the many , many signs dotting the roadside , with enticing messages ranging from the folksy ( " @entity236 i 'll be drugged " ) to the hippie ( " have you dug @entity215 ? " )			1
510 main street , @entity236 , @entity196 ; ( 605 ) 270 - 2175			0
@entity238 @entity239 you thought @entity240 was a must - see tourist destination ? take away the @entity243 's final resting place and the throne he died on and what does that leave you ? ok , still a lot of awesome decor and pantsuits			1
but to truly experience @entity251 ' impact , you need to look at his life through the lens of a true fan			0
and by fan we mean radical zealot			0
@entity258 turned his small @entity260 home into an altar for the @entity262 , and he welcomes visitors any hour of the day or night			0
he rarely sleeps and claims to drink around 24 cans of @entity265 a day			0
once inside you 'll see two floors jam packed with more memorabilia than could probably fit into the original @entity240			0
there 's even a bit of the original inside -- @entity271 claims to have 185,000 square inches of carpet that came from @entity251 ' former home			0
200 @entity275 ; @entity276 , @entity260 @entity277 , @entity278 sometimes it takes obsession of a more obscure brand to make an excellent roadside attraction			1
@entity284 , for example , has been hunting for the elusive skunk ape since he says he first sighted the smelly @entity287 relative at the age of 10			0
you can find all the hunting methods and tips that he 's accumulated over the years at his @entity277			0
you can also visit his bird and lizard zoo and get pointers on where to search for one of the seven to nine mighty beasts that @entity284 is sure live in the surrounding @entity301 area			0
@entity302 , @entity303 , @entity278 ; 239 - 695 - 2275 ; @entity304			0

*longtime* tourist attraction @entity93 is an *impressive* underground sight
@entity309 provides a message in the @entity20 desert
@entity215 has been luring *travelers* with ice water since the 1930s
