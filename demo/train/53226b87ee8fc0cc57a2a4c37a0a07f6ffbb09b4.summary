@entity0 -- when the polls close in most other democracies , the results are known almost instantly			2
ballots are usually counted accurately and rapidly , and nobody disputes the result			2
complaints of voter fraud are rare ; complaints of voter suppression are rarer still			0
the kind of battle we are seeing in @entity15 -- where @entity16 and @entity17 will go to court over whether early voting should span 14 days or eight -- simply does not happen in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 or @entity24			2
the ballot uncertainty that convulsed the nation after @entity15 's vote in 2000 could not happen in @entity28 or @entity29			1
almost everywhere else , elections are run by impartial voting agencies			2
in @entity24 , elections are the responsibility of the @entity35 , which establishes places and hours of voting , prints ballots ( @entity24 still uses paper ) and counts the votes			0
in @entity21 , an independent federal returning officer oversees a complex state and federal voting system			1
share your reaction to the election results in @entity22 , federal elections are managed by a specialized agency , @entity49			0
@entity28 , emerging from a sad history of electoral manipulation , created in the 1990s a respected independent agency , the @entity52			0
@entity29 has nationwide electronic voting , producing instantaneous , uncontested results			0
president @entity55 : my vision for @entity58 no voting system is perfect			1
@entity23 has faced allegations of chronic fraud in absentee balloting			0
as i write , @entity64 politics are convulsed by allegations of vote buying by one of its political parties			1
but here 's what does n't happen in other democracies : politicians of one party do not set voting schedules to favor their side and harm the other			1
politicians do not move around voting places to gain advantages for themselves or to disadvantage their opponents			1
in fact , in almost no other country do politicians have any say in the administration of elections at all			0
here 's a story from the 2000 election			1
like many old cities , @entity89 has not invested in modern voting equipment			0
at the scheduled poll - closing time , voters were still lined up throughout the city			0
@entity97 's campaign , desperate to win the state , asked a judge to extend voting for three more hours in the heavily @entity16 city -- but only in the city			1
republicans appealed , the state judge was overruled , and the polls were closed after remaining open a total of 45 additional minutes beyond the legal closing time			0
republicans won @entity110 's 11 electoral votes by a margin of 78,786 out of the almost 2.4 million cast			0
think about what 's incredible here : lines were lengthy in @entity89 because in the @entity58 , almost uniquely , local governments choose how voting is cast and counted			1
people who live in localities with less capable governments , such as @entity89 , will face greater delay and difficulty in casting their vote			0
@entity124 : my vision for @entity58 when local @entity16 officials saw themselves disadvantaged by the existing rules , they appealed to a judge for special treatment for its ( likely ) voters -- and only for those voters			2
( good news : in @entity110 , circuit judges are appointed by the governor and then confirmed in office by nonpartisan vote			0
in many states , however , judges are themselves elected in partisan elections			0
) the other party demanded that the existing rules be upheld , and the case was litigated on the fly , ending in a weird compromise that only failed to become a national scandal because the events in @entity15 were so much more dramatic			0
in any other democracy , voters nationwide would have cast their votes on the same kind of balloting equipment , subject to the same rules			0
your take : should we have polling places in churches ? the parties would have had a minimal role in supervising the election , and certainly would not have been allowed to ask for rule changes as the vote occurred			1
the voting would have been overseen by a national election commission , not by local judges , who might be nonpartisan -- but who very well might not			1
change the list : you convinced them to vote @entity58 worry more about voter fraud than do voters in other countries , because they are the only country without a reliable system of national identification			1
in no other country , including federal systems such as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity180 , does the citizen 's opportunity to vote depend on the affluence and competence of his or her local government			2
in every other democracy , the vote is the means by which the people choose between the competing political parties -- not one more weapon by which the parties compete			2
the @entity58 is an exceptional nation , but it is not always exceptional for good			2
the @entity58 voting system too is an exception : it is the most error - prone , the most susceptible to fraud , the most vulnerable to unfairness and one of the least technologically sophisticated on earth			1
after the 2000 fiasco , @entity58 resolved to do better			1
is n't it past time to make good on that resolution ? opinion : on @entity204 , pause to soak it in the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			1

@entity208 : *tuesday* 's vote is subject to all manner of disputes between parties
he says @entity58 voting system is locally controlled , gives too much power to politicians
other democracies establish national *standards* and *enforce* them equally , he says
@entity223 : after dispute over 2000 election , *reforms* were promised but have n't materialized
