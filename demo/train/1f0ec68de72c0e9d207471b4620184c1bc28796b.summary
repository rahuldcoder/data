" do not be misled by appearance , " @entity57 said			0
" appearance and reality can be as different as night and day			0
it would benefit everyone not to jump to any conclusion			0
" while any claims of violence against women , whether real or alleged , can be career ending for a celebrity , @entity10 seems to be a special case			1
this is not the first time he has been at the center of a domestic violence scandal , and the stories do n't seem to harm his reputation			0
@entity10 's long history of questionable behavior began in 1990 when he was dating actress @entity82			1

in one recent commercial , as he attempts to talk with retired basketball star @entity133 , he buffoonishly crashes his car and is cheered on for his antics by a parking valet			0
@entity138 , who teaches public relations at @entity140 , believes that the most recent incident wo n't harm @entity10 's status as a commercial spokesperson			1
he compares @entity46 with @entity144 , who was dropped by a number of sponsors in the wake of his own sex scandal where he admitted infidelity , though @entity144 unlike @entity10 has not been charged with any criminal wrongdoing			2
" the @entity10 scandal is a pretty stark contrast to @entity144			2
this behavior is built into the fabric of @entity10 's bad - boy profile , unlike with @entity144 where it was unexpected , " said @entity138			1
