the high - speed rail project was part of a transportation bill signed by @entity7 that calls for general improvements to the state 's rail system involving a total of $ 4.7 billion in state funding matched with $ 7.9 billion in federal and local funds , officials said			1
" this legislation will help put thousands of people in @entity2 back to work , " @entity7 said at @entity32 in downtown @entity0 , according to a news release			2
" by improving regional transportation systems , we are investing in the future of our state and making @entity2 a better place to live and work			0

the line is envisioned to carry travelers between @entity0 and @entity52 in 80 minutes and , in the northern part of the state , will eventually connect to @entity55 , the authority said			2
in all , the 800 miles of track will include up to 24 stations , the authority said			0

" true high - speed rails around the world are running between 186 miles an hour to 220 miles an hour			1
that 's pretty much the standard in the world			0
" the closest speed to the @entity2 project is @entity74 's @entity73 in the @entity75 , which averages 80 mph between @entity76 and @entity77 , but reaches 150 mph for a few miles near @entity78 , @entity59 said			2
that line is not built on a dedicated high - speed track as @entity2 's line will be , he said			1

and we want to keep it like that , " he said earlier this year			0
other critics are concerned about the potential for cost overruns , and question the project 's timing given the economic slump			0
@entity143 , a @entity144 state senator , was among those who voted against the bill			0
