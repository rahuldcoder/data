-- @entity1 walked up the driveway to the entrance of the @entity4 in @entity5 like it was a second home			1
surrounded by a large entourage as he was led to the red carpet , @entity1 stopped to bare a @entity9 's grin as he looked at the four lovely @entity10 waiting to pose for pictures with him			1
the rock star and the equally iconic home that has hosted thousands of parties seemed made for each other , but this was @entity1 's first visit ever to the @entity19 grounds			1
how was that possible that in all the years of @entity24 's success , the frontman had never been to one of the famous @entity27 parties or a @entity28 ? " i was too busy in someone 's bathroom getting high , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" i was too busy on tour , i was too busy writing songs			2
" while he had never been to the house that @entity33 built , @entity1 has crossed paths with the famed @entity35 , @entity33			1
and @entity1 is a big fan			1
" i love people that are committed to their crimes of passion and he is the gentleman of all time , " @entity1 told us			2
" he 's been on every man 's mind around the world at least a hundred times in their lifetime for what he did			0
so he signifies the joys of womanhood and not the degradation			0
and even women love @entity10			0
" what finally brought @entity1 to the mansion after more than 40 years in the spotlight was @entity56 , a program that allows people to live out their rock and roll dreams and spend four intense days training with counselors to play with @entity1 or other superstars , such as @entity65 ' @entity64 , who will be the headliner at an upcoming event in @entity68 from october 10 through 14			1
@entity1 got involved with the camp last year through @entity70 , a counselor in the program who co-wrote @entity24 's " @entity72			1
" " we spoke last year , i was doing a book , and they asked me here and i said i would , and i spoke in front of the whole camp			0
it 's called just being a mentor , if not to incite a riot , " he says			0
@entity1 had a challenge for this week 's campers , who joined him on stage at the mansion last night			1
" i just dared them all to learn an @entity24 song to see how good they can do it , " he says			2
" if they do it good , which i 'm sure they will , i 'm gon na pick the best group of them all , we 're gon na pick straws and the best one out of that gets to ride around in my car and hear the new @entity24 album			2
" when @entity1 says , while speaking of the upcoming record , " i 'm on fire , as you can tell , " he is not exaggerating			2
despite being pulled away by several handlers , he does n't want to stop talking about the new music , which is now in the mixing stages			0
" it 's one of the best @entity24 albums ever , " he says			1
" i 'm one of the worst judges of my own music because i 'm very harsh , highly critical			0
[ but ] we waited until we had at least four really good songs that were representative and we got 19			0
