-- since march 11 , the six reactors at the @entity3 nuclear power plant have been in various states of disrepair after being battered by a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami			1
here is the latest on the status of each reactor and what was being done to prevent further emissions of radioactive material			2
reactor no. 1 pressure and temperature levels at the no. 1 reactor continue to fluctuate , though @entity18 of @entity21 's nuclear and industrial safety agency told reporters friday that the situation then appeared " rather stable			1
" while conceding that " controlling the temperature and pressure has been difficult , " @entity18 said there were indications that the pressure and temperature were both decreasing			2
authorities hope to begin injecting fresh water , rather than seawater as has been done , into the reactor 's spent nuclear fuel pool			1
according to the @entity41 , a nuclear industry group basing its data on official government and utility information , the no. 1 unit 's reactor core has been damaged , but its containment vessel was not			1
as of friday , the reactor 's cooling systems were still not operational			2
still , the building was " severely damaged " by an earlier hydrogen explosion			0
while electricity issues remain , lighting has been restored for this and the no. 2 reactors			1
reactor no. 2 like with no. 1 , there has been evidence of high radiation levels in spots in and around the no. 2 reactor -- though not as high as that of the no. 3 unit			1
@entity18 said friday that authorities hope to start injecting fresh water ( rather than the current seawater ) into the reactor 's core and spent nuclear fuel pool			1
the water is being pumped in to help cool down nuclear fuel rods and prevent the further emission of radioactive material			0
damage is " suspected " in this unit 's containment vessel -- the only such vessel so compromised , according to the @entity41			0
the reactor 's core is also thought to be damaged			0
but the building itself has only been " slightly damaged , " the same group reports			0
that said , the containment vessel pressure is considered " stable , " the nuclear industry trade group reports			2
reactor no. 3 the water that three men stepped in while laying cable in the basement of the no. 3 unit 's turbine building had 10,000 times the amount of radiation typical for that locale , @entity18 said			1
the workers -- each of whom tested 170 or more millisieverts of radiation , including two with direct exposure on the skin -- were admitted friday for four days of observation at @entity21 's @entity98 , a research hospital in @entity99			2
he noted that the contamination likely came from the reactor 's core , adding there 's a possibility of " some sort of leakage			0
" that potentially could come from a crack in the reactor core , though @entity18 cautioned that there is no definitive answer yet on how the radioactivity got into the basement			0
despite the suspected damage to the reactor core -- something that is n't presumed at any of the other five reactors -- the nuclear safety official said there is evidence that pressure is somehow being maintained in the vessel , making it less likely there is a big gash			1
" radiation levels are high " in some locations in and around the reactor , @entity18 said			0
these issues , including the radiation in the water , are prompting authorities to consider " other routes " to address issues at the reactor without exposing workers to excess radiation			2
@entity18 said that , as of friday afternoon , there was no firm plan on workarounds			0
firefighters from @entity140 , with assistance from the @entity143 fire department , sprayed water friday on the no. 3 reactor and its spent nuclear fuel pool			1
the building of the no. 3 reactor was " severely damaged " after an explosion caused by the buildup of hydrogen gas , reports the @entity41			1
its core reactor is also damaged , its fuel rods are either partly or fully exposed			0
as to its nuclear spent fuel pool , reports are that the pool was " possibly damaged " and the water level has been low -- a reason for the repeated spraying			0
reactor no. 4 a concrete pump truck was used once again friday to inject seawater into the unit 's fuel pool			1
along with the @entity167 5 and 6 units , the no. 4 was offline on a scheduled outage when the earthquake hit , and as a result the reactor 's water level and pressure are continued safe			1
but its nuclear spent fuel pool was " possibly damaged , " which is why authorities have said its water levels are low and why they 've made repeated efforts to fill it up with seawater			0
reactor no. 5 the no. 5 unit appears safe , for now , @entity18 said			1
its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again , according to the @entity41			0
as with units @entity186 and 6 , this reactor was off on a scheduled outage when the quake hit and there are no major issues with the reactor and core itself			0
the nuclear spent fuel pool is thought to be functioning , aside from continued concerns about powering its cooling system to ensure that the fuel rods contained within remain cool			0
as with unit no. 6 , three holes were punched in the building earlier in order to relieve pressure and prevent a hydrogen explosion			2
reactor no. 6 the no. 6 unit appears safe , for now , @entity18 said			1
its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again , according to the @entity41			0
the no. 6 reactor was offline when the tsunami struck , and there are no major concerns about the structure or safety of its core or containment vessel			1
the nuclear spent fuel pool is thought to be functioning , aside from continued concerns about powering its cooling system to ensure that the fuel rods contained within remain cool			0
as with unit no. 5 , three holes were punched in the building earlier in order to relieve pressure and prevent a hydrogen explosion .			2

the @entity167 1 and 3 reactors are prime concerns at the *northeastern* @entity21 plant
authorities are trying to *determine* the source of an apparent leak in reactor no. 3
an official says no. 1 seems " rather stable " after *challenges* with heat and pressure
