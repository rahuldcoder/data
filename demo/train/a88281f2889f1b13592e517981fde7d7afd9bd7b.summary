-- a map of significant climate events for the @entity3 in june looks almost apocalyptic : hellish heat , ferocious fires and severe storms leaving people injured , homeless and even dead			1
why to expect more weather disasters that followed a warm winter and early season droughts			1
news came monday that the mainland @entity3 experienced its warmest 12 months since the dawn of record - keeping in 1895			1
and on tuesday , the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) released a report calling 2011 a year of extreme weather			1
wildfire victims face second tragedy remember @entity19 ? or the floods in @entity21 and southern @entity22 and the deadly drought in the @entity24 ? heavy rains in @entity26 caused massive landslides and much of @entity28 suffered through a sweltering heatwave			0
it 's tempting to simplify things and blame it all on global warming			1
after all , nine of the top 10 warmest years globally have occurred since 2000 , according to @entity14			2
but weather can be complicated			2
the real challenge is figuring out whether a particular storm or flood was due to climate change or natural variables , said @entity41 , founding director of the @entity43 's @entity42			1
the @entity14 report , for instance , noted some events that were exacerbated by other factors			2
however , climate change increases global risks , @entity41 said			1
" as we change the climate , we 're shifting the odds for extreme weather , " he said			1
photos : extreme heat strikes @entity3 it 's sort of like upping your chances of a car accident if you 're speeding			1
the four classes of extremes -- high heat , heavy precipitation and floods , duration and intensity of droughts and extremes related to higher sea levels -- have changed in the last 50 years , @entity41 said			0
" increasingly , we are loading the dice towards these very damaging kinds of extremes , " he said			0
but that 's not to say every weather event is related to warming temperatures			1
@entity77 , northern @entity78 , and the eastern two - thirds of @entity80 have felt the greatest warmth in 2012 , but many places -- @entity83 , @entity84 and most of @entity85 -- have been cool anomalies			0
@entity78 declares day of mourning for flood victims the men 's final at the wimbledon tennis tournament sunday was stopped briefly for rain			2
rain , in @entity94 ? although it has a reputation for sogginess , it 's been cooler and wetter than normal for the last few months in the @entity94 isles			1
@entity80 's northwest has also escaped the heat			2
the state of @entity103 just marked its seventh coolest june ever			0
" when you 've got a planet that 's nearest warmest levels on record , that does n't mean every part of the world is going to be the warmest ever , " said @entity104 , director of meteorology for @entity106			1
" the @entity3 has been unlucky enough to be in that sort of pattern , " he said			1
@entity116 , a climate scientist at the @entity117 , said weather patterns -- including the jet stream or the ocean - atmosphere systems in the @entity121 known as @entity122 and @entity123 -- have a great effect on weather			1
in 2011 , two back - to - back @entity126 , each characterized by cooler - than - average water temperatures in the eastern @entity121 , affected significant weather events -- including droughts in the @entity132 and northern @entity133 and in east @entity134			1
there is debate over how climate change affects such weather patterns but the @entity14 - led " state of the climate " report said @entity123 - related heat waves are now 20 times more likely to occur than 50 years ago			1
scientists also analyzed the @entity94 's very warm november 2011 and a very cold december 2010			1
they said that cold decembers are now half as likely to occur versus 50 years ago , whereas warm novembers are now 62 times more likely			0
the report pointed out that some weather events , like the @entity21 flooding , are influenced by humans in other ways			1
photos : finding beauty in violent storms " although the flooding was unprecedented , the amount of rain that fell in the river ' catchment ' area was not very unusual , " the report said			2
" other factors , such as changes in reservoir policies and increased construction on the flood plain , were found most relevant in setting the scale of the disaster			0
" the 2012 hurricane season has gotten off to a robust start , though meteorologist @entity168 attributed that to a cyclical warming of @entity172 waters			0
" we 've had a tremendous start to the system			0
we are in the middle of a warm phase , " he said			0
@entity179 in 1992 was devastating , but it was also the first named storm of that year -- in august			2
by contrast , this year , the @entity3 has already lived through four named storms -- two in may and two in june			1
the last was @entity186 , which flooded @entity187			0
the warmer waters can lead to warmer temperatures on land , @entity188 said			0
" the biggest thing of this year is the cumulative effect of the last two seasons			2
some parts of the @entity3 have been under drought conditions for the past two years , " he said , and did not have much rain in april and may			1
less solar energy is absorbed by hot , parched land			0
" the drought amplifies temperatures -- 90 becomes 100			0
" " the reality is when you do have extreme weather , it is highlighted , " downs said			1
" people want to attribute it to one factor or another			0
" the other reality is that @entity3 and others will likely be paying a lot more for cereal , sweeteners and meat as the price of corn goes up because of failed crops			1
" the crops are hurting , " said @entity221 , a grain market specialist at @entity223			0
the eastern part of the @entity225 is especially hard - hit			0
in states like @entity228 , farmers are in the critical stage of corn pollination			0
" we need a good inch of moisture this week , " @entity221 said			0
" and there 's no rain in the forecast			2
" that means we are looking for a much lower yield for crops we produce in the @entity239			0
" @entity241 heat endangers crops that means farmers will be devastated and consumers could see higher prices at the grocery store for corn , soy and wheat products , as well as meat from animals raised on corn feed			0
they will also be paying more to utility companies for running air - conditioners as the sizzling summer continues			0
" in july , august and september , there 's an above - average chance of warmer - than - average temperatures , " @entity116 said			2
the hottest year on record for the @entity3 is 1998			1
@entity116 said 2012 is on track to beat it			0
perhaps people should get used to hotter temperatures , experts say , because the trends point that way			0
a heatwave that occurred every 20 years will , by the year 2080 , occur every one to two years , @entity41 said			2
think it 's hot ? imagine living here the extreme weather the world is seeing now is a precursor to more , he said			1
and it paints a picture of what global warming looks like			0
" there are a lot of steps that can be taken to prepare people for climate extremes , " he said			2
" it 's kind of a situation that warrants very serious thought			2
" in releasing the state of the climate report tuesday , deputy noaa administrator @entity287 said 2011 will be remembered for extreme weather			1
this year seems to be on the same track			2
from now on , she said , every weather event takes place in the context of a changing global environment			0
