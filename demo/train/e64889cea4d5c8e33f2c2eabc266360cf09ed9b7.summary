@entity0 -- @entity4 police have arrested two more suspects and are looking for two others in the reported gang rape of a female photographer in @entity9 , authorities said			1
one person had been arrested earlier saturday			0
the alleged rape of the 23 - year - old woman in the financial hub of @entity9 on thursday is the latest shocking sexual assault to make headlines in the @entity17 nation			1
the unidentified victim and a male colleague were on assignment in the area for a print publication when some of the men approached them , according to @entity9 police commissioner @entity25			1
the two had walked from a train station to a nearby mill , the woman said in a statement released by police			1
two people approached them , then a third came in , claiming to be a railway employee and saying , " our boss has seen you taking photos , you will have to come with us			2
" according to the woman , this third man refused to let her talk to his boss , instead leading them away			0
then , sometime near the exit , one of the accused pointed at the photojournalist 's colleague as being responsible for a killing in that location a few days ago			0
" i pleaded with them to let us go , but they shouted at me and threatened me , " the woman said			0
she and her colleague were taken further inside the mill complex			2
there , they offered their camera and phone , begging to be let go			0
instead , " they tied my friend 's hands with ( a ) belt " as two others joined the group , the woman said			2
" three people stayed with my friend , and the two took me behind a wall , " she added			2
that 's where the attack allegedly occurred -- even as the victim said her mother called her phone multiple times , before one of the men switched it off			2
the woman said she was threatened with , among other things , sharp pieces of a broken beer bottle			0
police have since released sketches of all five suspects			0
the victim was in stable condition at a local hospital , the attack rocked @entity9 residents , who consider their city safer than the capital , @entity0			1
according to the @entity93 , 221 rape cases were reported in @entity9 in 2012			1
but figures provided by the government show that there has been a rape reported to police every day in @entity9 between january and march			1
the average number of reported rapes in a month in 2013 in the city rose to 30.33 , from 19.25 in 2012			0
@entity101 said the number of reported rapes in the capital had jumped from 179 for the first 3Â½ months of last year to 463 for the same period this year			0
a rise in the number of rapes reported does not necessarily mean that more are being committed			0
it may be that recent high - profile cases have encouraged women to come forward with complaints			1
the case mirrors the december gang rape and death of a 23 - year - old university student in the @entity4 capital			1
the victim later died at a hospital in @entity118 , sparking an outcry that quickly grew to include widespread concerns about women 's safety and inequalities , triggering demonstrations in various cities			0

despite such action , frequent episodes of sexual violence are reported in @entity4			1
across @entity4 , 24,923 cases of rape were reported last year , according to the @entity93			1
