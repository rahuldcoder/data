flying above @entity1 , veterinarian @entity0 steps out onto the helicopter 's skid and aims his rifle ; below him a white rhino lumbers across the @entity7 bush			1
as the helicopter swoops in low , herding the animal closer to the road , @entity0 looks through the scope and fires a single shot			0
a flash of pink on the rump is all it takes to bring the two - ton animal staggering to the ground where fellow veterinarians are ready and waiting , armed with a blindfold			2
the @entity21 works quickly : an oxygen tube is inserted into the subdued rhino 's nostril			1
blood , hair and skin samples are taken for dna			0
then , after another injection to partially reverse the effects of the tranquilizer , the rhino is pulled to its feet and led into a trailer for the journey to safer ground -- away from this poaching hotspot along the @entity39 border , to a recently established " intensive protection zone " deeper into the park			0
the team 's members are no ordinary veterinarians , but daily captures like this one are quickly becoming the norm for a team tasked with the care of @entity49 's most threatened species			1
they 've already conducted more than 30 relocations since last month , and will conduct hundreds more			0
they are a key part of a protection plan which has taken on even greater urgency since the country 's environmental minister announced that a record 1,020 of @entity7 's rhinos have been poached this year			1
the illegal trade in rhino horn is fueled by an insatiable demand in @entity61 , where it is prized as a sign of wealth and believed to have medicinal value -- though there 's no scientific evidence to support claims that it has healing properties			1
@entity71 horn is made of keratin , the same protein found in human fingernails , but it can still fetch as much as $ 5,550 an ounce on the black market -- that 's more than the price of gold , more than the price of platinum -- and roughly equivalent to the price of cocaine			1
@entity1 , which is home to roughly 10,000 rhinos -- a quarter of the world 's population -- shares a 350 - kilometer border with impoverished @entity39 , making it a massive target for poachers			1
" we were rangers , now we 're at war , " the park 's head of anti-poaching , major general @entity90 , told @entity93			1
but while new equipment and new technology has helped lead to a record number of poaching arrests this year , it has done little to slow the slaughter			0
the general says his enemy has a nearly limitless supply of foot soldiers ready to cross the border and risk it all for small slice of the profit : last month alone , 600 poachers infiltrated the park from @entity39			0
" once a poacher is in the park , it 's like a burglar in your home , " said @entity90 , who admitted that in a park the size of @entity115 , military - style patrols alone will never be enough to save @entity49 's rhinos , and that much more needs to be done outside the park 's boundaries			2
the intensive protection zones will at least give his rangers the chance to establish what the general calls sanctuaries within a sanctuary			0
" we made the decision that we are here for the living rhino , not the dead , " @entity90 explained			0
there was a time when this park , famous and now targeted for its prized rhinos , had none			2
several relocations , including one from 1960 to 1972 that introduced 300 rhinos , helped grow @entity49 's population , which reached its peak of 12,200 rhinos in 2010			2
" this is exactly what we 've been doing for the last 30 years , " said @entity146 , head of veterinary services at @entity49 about this latest round of relocations			0
" @entity71 have recovered before			0
" slaughtered for a horn that for millennia has been its first line of defense , conservationists are now counting on the rhino 's extreme adaptability to save it from extinction .			1

a record 1,020 rhinos have been poached in @entity7 in 2014
veterinarians and rangers are relocating rhinos in the country 's @entity1
rhinos are targeted for their horns , which are *wrongly* believed to have medicinal value
insatiable demand in @entity61 means rhino horn is worth more per ounce than gold , platinum
