@entity0 -- thirty to 40 years ago , when arcade and console games were primitive and parents condemned them as a new threat to their children 's schooling , it was probably hard to imagine one of @entity12 's leading museums embracing video games as an artform			1
fast forward to 2012 , and many parents are still trying to limit their kids ' gaming hours			0
but video games themselves are increasingly ambitious , interactive and artistically complex -- an evolution celebrated in a new show at the @entity23			1
the exhibition , " @entity27 , " explores 40 years of video games as cultural artifacts			1
it features interactive games people can actually play , pieces of gaming memorabilia and visual displays that highlight the artistic work done by developers			2
and as the first such exhibition to appear in a major museum , it 's been a huge hit			1
museum officials said their opening last month drew nearly 23,000 people , putting it in the top five highest visitation days ever			1
@entity44 , guest curator of the exhibition , believes the timing is right because the current generation of museum - goers have grown up with video games			1
" the exhibit will highlight the games they grew up with , and in a way , tell the story of their lives , " he said			2
" people will see a game or artwork and remember what they were doing when that game was in their life			2
" from ' @entity63 ' to ' flower ' based on the response from the crowds that packed the museum opening weekend , @entity44 may be right			1
many visitors seemed thrilled at the chance to relive bits of nostalgia from their youth			2
" i thought it was pretty neat to watch the evolution of games , " said @entity74 , a woman from @entity75 , @entity76 , who declined to give her last name			2
" i grew up playing ' @entity82 ' on the @entity83 but got away from games until my son started playing			2
" " we got our first @entity91 when he [ son @entity93 ] was 6 months old , " said @entity86 of southern @entity87 , who also did n't give her full name			0
" the old stuff has an artistic feel to it when you look at where games are now			2
it brings back a lot of memories for me about when my kids were growing up			0
" " i thought it was amazing , " said @entity93 , now 21			0
" people will be able to come to the @entity106 and still learn about video games and see the beauty in them			1
" the exhibit includes five playable games , from dot - chompin ' arcade classic " @entity63 " to 2009 's " flower , " a conceptual game in which players spread positive energy by blowing a flower petal through the air			1
one of its major pieces is a display of 20 different video game consoles throughout the years			1
from the @entity83 to the @entity124 , each display features four games that were voted on by fans around the world as the best representatives for that console			2
developers ' reaction most game developers contacted by @entity1 were excited about being recognized for what they 've been doing most of their lives			2
while the question of " video games as art " sparks debate in some circles , game makers agree that raising the level of discussion to include the @entity106 is a welcome event			1
" @entity146 : among thieves " was one of the games honored for the @entity124 console			2
@entity151 , creative director for the game , said the question of whether video games belong in an art museum is irrelevant			1
" of course they are [ art ]			2
it 's just another medium			0
it 's just interactive , " she said			0
" to see such a mainstream recognition of our medium , i mean , it really is the first time that that 's happened			0
i think that 's a huge cultural event and hugely gratifying			0
" but the idea that being in the @entity106 somehow legitimizes the work of the video game industry does n't sit well with @entity172 creative director @entity171			1
" i could n't care less , " he said			0
it 's great to see it at a museum			1
but , it does n't mean to me a lot			0
it does n't mean anything in terms of a paradigm shift			0
" @entity171 said the @entity106 just adds a new voice to the already burgeoning discussion about games taking place over the internet in recent years			1
" there is probably more conversation about games ... than there was in 500 years of landscape painting , " he said			1
he believes the exhibit may raise the level of games in the eyes of people who overlook how important video games are to our culture and society			1
" the more places we can talk about what we do , the better , " @entity171 said			0
" we are a ghettoized industry in the sense that ... we 're not on ' @entity206			0
' even though guys like ' @entity208 ' are going to sell 25 million copies of their game -- they 're not on			0
" the nature of art in discussing the exhibition , gamers and developers agree that video games are similar to other forms of art in that they 're not complete until experienced by someone			1
every person reacts to an artwork differently , lending it meanings that even its creator did n't intend			0
given their interactive nature , this may be especially true of video games , @entity171 said			1
" [ @entity27 ] has no life outside of being viewed			1
like the @entity229 , it changes every time it is viewed			0
that 's what 's wonderful about it			0
it 's entirely subjective , " he said			0
" it is , by nature , somebody enforcing their creative will on you			0
that 's what being a viewer is			0
part of the joy of experiencing art is surrendering yourself to it			0
sometimes , it is a good experience and sometimes , it is not			0
" the " @entity27 " exhibition runs through september 30 .			1
