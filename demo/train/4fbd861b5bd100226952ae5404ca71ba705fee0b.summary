@entity0 -- setting national standards for @entity4 students has been tried in the past without success -- but a new state - led effort is gaining momentum , according to an official of an educational think tank that compiled a nationwide study comparing standards			1
the new benchmarks -- called @entity15 -- are a move initiated at the state level to come up with a set of standards that will be used by all states to create cross-border consistency in what students will be expected to know			1
in june , the @entity15 recommendations were released to the public by the @entity26 and state education heads			2
so far 26 states have signed on to the national @entity15 while several have opted not to use the standards			1
each state currently evaluates its elementary and secondary students according to its own state benchmarks , which vary greatly across state lines			0
" you look at these standards and most @entity4 would say , ' sure , this is what we want our students to know , ' " says @entity35 vice president @entity34			1
since the @entity15 are part of a state - led effort , @entity34 says they have avoided the debate about the federal government pushing standards on the rest of the country			1
also , the writers of the recommendations have done " a pretty good job of putting together good standards , " according to @entity34			0
read the @entity15 the @entity0 - based @entity35 on wednesday released results of its study comparing the standards - of - learning of all 50 states and the @entity0 with the @entity15 that have been proposed for the whole country			1
additionally , the study graded the @entity15 themselves			2
the @entity15 overall get a b + in @entity61 language arts and an a- in mathematics , according to the institute			0
on the more local level , @entity65 , the @entity0 and @entity66 received the highest marks in @entity61 language arts with more stringent standards than the national recommendations , according to the institute 's study , while 37 states fell below the recommended @entity15 standards			1
in mathematics , there were no states that had standards that were clearly better than the @entity15 , but @entity65 , the @entity0 , @entity79 , @entity66 and @entity0 were close to the mark			1
the report found that , overall , the @entity15 scored well in clarity and content			0
it will take several years for plans to be put in place for the states to actually start testing students under national guidelines			2
the @entity90 and @entity91 signed onto the @entity15 on wednesday			0
the high - profile vote was made after three hours of public comment that included a gubernatorial candidate who spoke against the adoption and two former commissioners of education that spoke for the change			0
in the education community , @entity100 is considered to have high state benchmarks already , so there was a question as to whether or not they should alter their current criteria			0
@entity108 gubernatorial candidate @entity107 said that " tinkering with this proven track record makes no sense			0
" but state education secretary @entity111 said , " all along , the conversation about @entity15 has been about the @entity113 seizing the opportunity to improve upon our already high standards			2
