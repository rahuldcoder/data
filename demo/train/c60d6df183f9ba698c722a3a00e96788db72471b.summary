-- for @entity2 , being vegan is n't only about what she eats and chooses to wear each day			1
avoiding meat and dairy in her diet and animal - derived products in her closet is just part of the equation for the 30 - year - old designer , businesswoman and animal lover			1
as founder of fashion label @entity20 , her dedication to creating animal - free coats , sweaters and other cold - weather gear has earned her a global cult following among animal rights activists and eco-conscious fashionistas			1
her activism began when she was 10 years old with an elementary school social studies project in suburban @entity28 on factory farming and the fur industry			0
she became vegan at 17 and continued her activism in high school with a campaign for alternatives to animal dissection in science class that , with the help of national group @entity38 , eventually became @entity41 law			2
this week , she took her philosophy to @entity43 , where she debuted her first ready - to - wear line in a solo show wednesday , less than five years since starting @entity20 in 2008			1
@entity46 , @entity47 and other big - name designers have created fur - free collections in previous seasons			1
but @entity20 is the first independent fashion house to show during @entity43 with animal - and cruelty - free built into its brand dna , from its ultrasuede elbow patches to @entity56 - lined winter jackets			1
the line 's aesthetic goes beyond faux fur and leather , using organic , recycled and high - tech fabrics in an effort to redefine traditional outerwear staples			1
before a packed showroom in @entity67 's @entity66 gallery district , models , accessorized with rescue dogs available for adoption , showed off @entity20 's line of coats , dresses and pants of waxed canvas , velvet and moleskin ( a heavy - napped cotton twill fabric , despite its name ) , among other materials			1
even the shoes , by @entity81 is @entity83 and @entity84 , were vegan			0
though @entity20 's line comes at a time when consumers seem more willing than ever to pay a premium for products from companies or businesses whose values align with theirs , industry insiders say the company is swimming against the tide in a season expected to bring new twists on leather and fur			1
but @entity2 , an activist at heart , is undaunted			2
she believes that there are people like her who care about where their clothes come from and how they 're made			0
it 's @entity20 's role to make those options more accessible , she said			1
" i want to reach women who love style , love color , love fashion , and maybe they used to care about where their clothes came from but at some point they told themselves that it was naive to care , " @entity2 said			2
" i think it 's important that people see that you can care , you can interact with the world in the way you want and it 's not naive			0
but to do that , you need options			0
" @entity20 's values infused all aspects of the show , from the animal - free makeup and hair products used on the models to the vegan petit fours and cheesecakes inscribed with a v from @entity132 of @entity133 , @entity134			1
leashed rescue dogs were led around the audience by volunteers from the @entity138 of @entity67 and @entity139			0
the list of sponsors included some of the biggest names in animal rights activism : the @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
by sponsoring fashion events and designers like @entity152 , these groups get a chance to share their mission with buyers , fashion editors and industry insiders , key influencers of consumer trends			0
" it 's a great audience for us to get our message in front of , " said @entity160 , outreach manager of the @entity138 's fur - free campaign , which sponsored @entity163 's runway show in 2006 and @entity47 in 2008			1
the @entity138 tracks progress through a growing list of designers and companies that have adopted fur - free policies			1
but @entity152 has taken the commitment to " cruelty - free " fashion a step further with @entity20 , @entity160 said			1
" she 's not only trying to do her part for fur - bearing animals but for animals all over , " @entity160 said			2
" we 're very thankful she 's out there and attracting so much attention from the fashion industry			2
" the genesis of the company came from @entity186 's own desire for a stylish winter coat that was n't " accidentally vegan " because it used substitutes for wool , fur or leather to drive down costs			1
she was a @entity194 candidate on break working as a @entity197 fashion model in @entity198 when she decided that entrepreneurship was the best way for her to make a difference			0
" i realized that if i could create a business where the process in itself was actually creating positive change , that would be my activism , " she said in a phone interview last week from a noisy @entity67 coffee shop in between final preparations for her show			0
" i started with outerwear because i found being cold was an excuse to wear animal products , " she said			2
" i wanted to figure out where i would be needed to make a contribution to the movement so people would no longer need to use products and materials made from animals			0
" whether consumers are ready to give up fur , leather and wool is another story , even if it 's in favor of equally stylish and warm alternatives			1
@entity2 knows there is a market for animal - free fashion among people like her , vegan or not , who take conscious consumerism to an active level			1
many of those people attended wednesday 's show and were thrilled by what they saw , regarding the @entity238 - inspired collection as a validation of their beliefs			2
" compared to even just a couple of years ago , there are now so many cruelty - free alternatives to products that we used to think required the bloodshed of animals -- everything from shoes to cosmetics to luxury fabrics , " @entity241 , executive director of @entity242 , a nonprofit animal advocacy organization in @entity67 , said after the show			1
" as a society , we 're evolving away from commodifying animals , because , finally , it is becoming clear that it 's not only cruel , it 's unnecessary			0
there are accessible , affordable , sustainable and attractive alternatives that are ethically sourced and cost no lives			0
why not choose them ? " people want to do the right thing , she says , citing growing excitement around organic food , fair labor practices , and even faux fur and leather as evidence			2
but some see the interest in fake animal material in fashion as simply the trickle down effect from more of the real thing appearing on runways			2
even if interest in animal - free fashion might be greater than ever , in the same way that more people are willing to go vegan or pay extra for locally made products , trend forecasters say there 's a greater interest in looks incorporating fur and leather , which will be reflected on the runway this season			1
part of it is a continuation of the seasonless fashion trend that began showing up unexpectedly in spring and summer collections , said @entity297 , womenswear editor of style forecaster @entity298			0
but most of it has to do with the luxurious look of leather and fur , plain and simple , @entity300 said			2
" there 's a point of view from many people in the fashion industry that having real leather or fur pieces adds a kind of elevated conception , " she said			1
" everyone is always trying to look like their outfit costs more or have more worth or more value to it , especially during economic hardships , people want to make sure they 're putting money into something that will last			0
" @entity2 understands that perspective , which is why it has taken her this long to come up with looks that she hopes will make the fashion world and consumers take notice , she said			2
creating garments of high - tech materials to convey the indulgent look of high fashion took months of research , especially for someone with no formal training in fashion , she said			2
with coats and skirts starting at $ 200 , @entity20 's price tags are also typical @entity43 , at least on the low end of the scale			1
@entity2 said the prices reflect the quality of materials and the cost of paying workers a living wage to produce most of the garments in @entity350 , where she lives			0
( the line 's knits come from @entity353			0
) " i knew i had to design something that would be innovational for the entire industry			0
not using animal fibers was an opportunity to look past what was just good enough to make something truly superior , " she said			0
but even attendees of wednesday 's show who were receptive to the concept acknowledged that it 's an uphill battle to change an industry or consumer behavior			0
simply making animal - free clothing available is a big step in the right direction , especially if it 's hip and stylish , said @entity370 , a freelance fashion writer who attended the show so she could write about it on her blog , @entity373			1
" i think that ( animal - free clothes ) really came to the forefront with @entity46 and ever since then it 's been a big deal			1
it 's more mainstream and the clothes are just so young , " @entity370 said			0
fur coats and leather pants are easy enough to cut out of your wardrobe , she said			0
but everything else ? " it 's hard to cut all that out			0
