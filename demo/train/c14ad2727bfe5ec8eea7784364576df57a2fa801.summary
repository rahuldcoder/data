it 's on most everybody 's bucket list , and for good reasons			1
it is one of the most transcendentally beautiful spots on earth			2
but how do you get to the @entity10 , and what do you do to make the trip easy , comfortable and meaningful ? it 's not the attitude , but the altitude @entity16 , the gateway to @entity0 , is more than 11,000 feet above sea level , a height that can cause altitude sickness , especially for travelers coming from low elevations			1
@entity0 is at 7,874 feet , so the best plan to mitigate altitude sickness is to arrive at @entity16 in the morning ( the first flight from @entity26 departs at 6 a.m. ) and then immediately grab the first train down to @entity0			1
enjoy @entity16 on the back end after acclimatization			2
how do you get there ? several airlines have direct service from @entity35 gateways to @entity26 , and from there it is an hour flight to @entity16 , the ancient @entity38 capital			2
@entity39 has the most direct routing as it serves several major @entity35 cities , including @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , with a seamless link to @entity16			2
once in @entity16 the choices are generally foot or train down to @entity0			1
the @entity48 is a five - day trek over some high passes			2
it is a spectacular way to enter the citadel of @entity0 , but it requires a measure of fitness			1
it is easy to take several types of trains the 70 miles from @entity16 to @entity58 , the town at the base of the @entity61			2
the most deluxe train experience is the one - car @entity38 princess			1
once at @entity58 it is a bus ride up a steep , severe chevron of a road to the @entity68 of the @entity38			2
the government now limits the number of visitors to 5,000 a day , so it 's best to get your ticket in advance , as some folks have been turned away at the entrance gate after making the long trip			1
you can make your own arrangements or book through a number of veteran outfitters such as @entity83			1
they will arrange all tickets , transfers , transport , accommodations and guides			0
when is the best time to see @entity0 ? @entity0 is open year - round , but october to april is the rainy season , and therefore it has the fewest visitors			1
the inconvenience of rain is offset by the lack to tourists , and it is worth considering			0
avoid holidays if you can , as @entity0 and everything surrounding it is packed			1
once at @entity58 ( hotel tip : check in at @entity101 ) , to avoid the crowds and witness one of the most spectacular sunrises in the world , take the first bus from @entity58 , which leaves at 5:30 a.m. it 's worth it			0
hints for inside the citadel there are no bathrooms , restaurants or drinking water once you enter the site , but there are facilities just before the entrance			1
so hold onto your entrance ticket so you can exit and re-enter			1
pack sunscreen , a sun hat and water			0
weather in the @entity10 can also change in an instant , so you should also pack a rain jacket			0
@entity131 shoes are a must			0
if you are in reasonable shape , sign up to climb @entity135 , the famous peak within the ruins that appears in most photos			0
they only allow 400 a day to climb , so sign up the day before and go early for best views			1
what else can you do in the area ? if you have time , sign up for the day raft trip on the @entity144 through the @entity145 of the @entity38 -- one of the most spectacular float trips in the world			0
and , of course , plan on spending at least two days in @entity16 , a unique blend of @entity152 and @entity38 sensibilities with superb restaurants , hotels and accessible ruins			0
and try to make a stop at the nearby @entity158 market , one of the most colorful bazaars in the world			0
most people visit @entity158 on sunday , the main market day , but there are smaller markets on tuesday and thursday			0
finally , consider extending your trip to other wonders of @entity169 , including the @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 , all of which are served by @entity39 , with @entity26 as the hub			0
what makes @entity0 so special ? there is a harmony of elements here , the man - made and the natural			1
it is a stunning integration of architecture , setting , function , space and form			0
the @entity38 knew something we seek : when order combines with complexity , when elegance appears effortless and when there is a coherent but unspoken relationship among the parts , then there is enduring beauty			0
@entity196 is the producer for the upcoming public television special , " @entity169 : quest for wonder			0

going directly to @entity0 may help *alleviate* altitude sickness
hold onto your entrance ticket so you can exit to use facilities and re-enter
you can go by foot or train ; be sure to book early
