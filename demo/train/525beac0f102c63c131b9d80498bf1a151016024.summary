@entity1 's interest in @entity3 manufacturing began with a family road trip			1
she and her husband loaded up their motor home in summer 2011 and visited small towns across the country whose fate seemed to be tied to the presence of industry			0
where plants and factories had closed down , they found empty main streets with boarded - up storefronts			0
in other places , such as @entity22 , @entity23 , home to the @entity25 factory , they found vibrant communities where they could tour manufacturing facilities and witness the pride employees took in their work			0
when the trip was over , she started a @entity34 account to share resources for all things made stateside			2
as @entity38 has evolved into a website , @entity37 has learned that even though she can find plenty of goods made in the @entity3 , it 's impossible to live off them			1
but she said the holiday season is the perfect time to experiment with how far she can go			1
for the second year in a row , @entity37 has pledged to buy as many gifts as possible made in the @entity3			1
knowing where to start can be a challenge , but @entity37 and others for whom conscious consumerism means buying @entity3 say there are many places to check out , from craft fairs , @entity56 and specialty boutiques to e-commerce			1
made in @entity3 : the short list " gift - giving creates the perfect opportunity to try to buy @entity3			1
you have extra time to research , and you have flexibility in what you choose to buy , " said the married mother of two from @entity64			1
" i 'm a realist			0
i know that it 's impossible to buy entirely @entity3 - made products year - round , but i also know there 's a lot of wonderful @entity3 - made products , made by proud @entity3 , and it 's worth my time to look for them			1
" @entity3 @entity38 : holiday gift guide @entity37 is n't alone			1
motivated by a desire to boost the domestic economy or doubts over outsourcing , some @entity3 are making an effort to shop local for holiday gifts this year			1
it 's a niche market , but it 's one that has been growing in recent few years , and brands are starting to take notice			0
a growing number of small companies have been catering to the desire for @entity3 - made clothing and accessories , fueled in large part by style blogs touting the benefits of heritage brands			1
well spent : 50 under $ 50 on a larger scale , @entity97 announced last week that it would shift some of its production back to the @entity3 , citing customer demand for @entity3 - made products			1
though some have characterized the announcement as a publicity ploy that wo n't do much to alter @entity97 's manufacturing operations , it follows a continuing pattern of @entity3 companies bringing manufacturing back home due to rising labor , supply and production costs in @entity112			2
some say buying @entity3 is a drop in the bucket when it comes to boosting the domestic economy , but experts agree that every bit counts			1
manufacturing has the highest multiplier effect of any industry , meaning that it benefits other sectors that supports its operations			0
" anytime something is manufactured in the @entity3 it 's going to have greater gains in terms of jobs than something made overseas , " said @entity125 , chief economist for the @entity126			1
still , @entity97 's announcement wo n't help @entity37			0
her son wants an @entity135 for @entity136 , and she 's going to get it for him despite the fact that it 's assembled in @entity112 and will continue to be made there			2
( @entity97 only plans to manufacture some of its line of @entity141 computers in the @entity3			2
) otherwise , just about every gift on @entity37 's holiday shopping list is made in the @entity3 or locally sourced			1
the only other exception is a @entity147 children 's picture book , which is written by an @entity3 author , and published by an @entity3 company , but printed in @entity112			2
but pajamas bearing the cartoon cat 's likeness that will accompany the book are made in @entity3 , she said			1
electronics and appliances made in the @entity3 are hard to come by , but jewelry , clothing , accessories , beauty products , even holiday decorations are easier to find than you might think , she said			1
buying @entity3 for the holidays has n't changed her budget significantly , she said			1
she 'll spend about $ 700 on family , friends and white elephant gifts , about the same as in recent years			0
the only difference is that she spends a bit more time searching			0
she 's giving most of her relatives food gift baskets from local specialty markets , bakeries that make their own products or confectioners across the country			1
others are getting hats , sweaters and bags made in the @entity3 from brands whose products are available online			1
big - box retailers sometimes surprise with their " @entity186 " labels , she said			0
she has found cast - iron cookware and paper products at @entity189			2
@entity190 and @entity191 sell some beauty products , candles and paper products that make great @entity195 gifts			1
" once you start looking , it 's amazing what you find , " she said			0
" when you start to look , you notice patterns			0
i find new brands every time i go in			0
" @entity202 is also on mission to buy only @entity3 for the holiday season			1
she runs the website made in usa challenge , which she started in 2011 with the goal of finding and sharing domestically produced goods , from toys and clothes to food , wine and dog toys			2
made in @entity213 : @entity214 she spent about $ 300 on jewelry , toys and clothing from @entity56 and e-commerce sites that she has learned about through her site			2
she even found a coloring book at @entity222			0
the only @entity224 product is a stuffed animal for her 2 - year - old son , she said			0
when she ca n't find something made in the @entity3 , she turns to thrift stores , which is where she found a life - size sea turtle toy for $ 8			2
" at least i 'm keeping it out of a landfill , " she said			0
made in @entity213 : holiday gift ideas for kids children and teens are often the hardest to shop for because they often want electronics , licensed products or brand - name clothing that is likely made in @entity112 -- and that 's ok			1
" you do n't have to be hard core about it , " @entity202 said			0
" just set a goal and try it in little amounts			0
every little bit makes a difference			0
" for the brand - agnostic , clothing , accessories and jewelry are available in a variety of price points , thanks to a growing resurgence of interest in @entity3 - made fashion , @entity202 said			2
most of it carries a higher price tag than foreign - made counterparts , but if you 're going to splurge on a gift , there 's no better time than holidays , @entity202 said			2
for budget - conscious shoppers , it could just mean spending the same amount as planned on fewer , more meaningful products			0
" it 's a matter of priorities and choosing quality over quantity , " she said			0
" people did n't used to expect @entity195 to bring them five to 10 gifts under the tree			0
it might be more of an investment , but you could end up with fewer disposable products that 'll be in your family for generations			0
" follow @entity284 living on @entity285 and @entity286 on @entity34			0

gift shopping is the perfect time to test how far you can go buying local , bloggers say
@entity293 : " you have extra time to research , and *...* flexibility in what you choose to buy "
kids can be hard to shop for because they often want electronics , licensed toys
check labels at @entity190 , @entity191 for beauty products , paper goods made in @entity3 , some say
