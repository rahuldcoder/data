vice president @entity0 delivered a wonky , populist speech on monday in @entity2 where he endorsed @entity3 for @entity4 and lambasted @entity5 for forgetting about the middle class			1
@entity0 , who is known for being folksy and prides himself on relating to working class voters , attacked @entity5 for what he called attempts to roll back @entity11 , privatize social security and stop any raise of the minimum wage			0
" what are these guys , " @entity0 questioned at one point during the speech			0
" this is a different breed , " the vice president said of @entity5			1
" they are n't bad or good , they are just different			0
they are just really , really different			0
" @entity0 endorsed @entity3 as the right choice for @entity24 voters and , at times , attacked @entity5 @entity26 , @entity3 's opponent			1
@entity0 , however , did n't refer to her by name , instead calling her " @entity3 's opponent			1
" the vice president also nationalized the race , saying that , " this election in @entity24 is more important than @entity24			1
" " this election in @entity24 is about sending a message to the entire country and to our @entity5 colleagues who know better , " @entity0 said			2
" if @entity3 wins and i believe he will ... it is going to break the back of the hard right			0
" @entity0 has been a strong supporter for @entity3 , both in this senate race and his previous races for @entity41			1
the senate hopeful said the vice president -- who is considering a run at president in 2016 -- has been in @entity24 so much that " he does n't need a gps " in the state , " he just needs to know where he is going			1
" the @entity51 race has remained close throughout and looks like it will come down to the last eight days of campaigning			1
polls have each campaign within striking distance of one another , a fact that -- coupled with @entity24 being the crucial first - in - the - nation caucus state for the presidency -- has drawn out a number of big name @entity61 and @entity5			0
@entity5 sen. @entity63 will be in @entity64 on tuesday , while @entity65 , who 's polling ahead of any other @entity66 considering a 2016 presidential bid , will visit @entity2 on wednesday			1
speaker of the house @entity68 will also visit @entity2 on monday night , a fact that was not lost on the vice president			2
" my friend , @entity68 , and he is my friend , " will be here later , @entity0 said			0
" i hope he talks about what the @entity5 are for			0
" then @entity0 turned to one camera on the riser next to him and acted like he was talking directly to @entity68 : " talk about what the @entity5 are for @entity68 , it is your buddy @entity76			0
" after the speech , which included rep. @entity82 , @entity0 and @entity3 shook hands with supporters as @entity86 's " @entity85 " played in the background			1
at one point , a women presented @entity0 with her baby			0
the vice president showed surprise and chatted with the mother			2
when someone asked them to pose for a photo , the vice president obliged			2
after the photo , instead of kissing the baby -- which is an old political cliche -- @entity0 turned to his right and laid a kiss on the woman 's temple .			2
