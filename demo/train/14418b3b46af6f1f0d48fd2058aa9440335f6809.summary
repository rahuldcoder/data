@entity0 -- it hits you just a few steps past the @entity6 checkpoint , at the sounds and sight of a mule - pulled cart passing by : to enter @entity0 is to step back in time			1
also front and center : the question of whether hate will ever give way to peace			2
in the city square , there 's a giant billboard celebrating the @entity6 militant wing that carries out attacks in @entity21			1
nearby , posters paying tribute to men @entity6 calls " martyrs " but who by most any other definition would be called terrorists			1
@entity29 : ' peace is possible , ' but see the world as @entity32 do opinion : @entity29 goes over @entity35 's head to the @entity21 people poverty is everywhere , as is rundown housing			1
seeing the mules and horses pulling carts @entity42 on roads with mostly beat - up cars is a back to the future experience			2
yet step behind one factory gate and you come to the realization @entity0 does n't have to be so bleak			1
the @entity50 bottling franchise has been in @entity0 nearly 50 years , founded by @entity52 's grandfather			1
it bottles @entity55 , @entity50 , and , on this day , an orange soda popular in the @entity58 world , @entity59			0
after blocks and blocks of blight , watching the bottling line is an impressive sight			0
but it is also evidence of the price @entity0 pays for @entity21 's anger at @entity6			1
@entity69 does n't like getting caught up in the political debates			0
but he does note that men with jobs are less likely to get caught up in violence and terror			0
in its heyday , the factory had 600 workers			0
now there are about 300 , many of them working only part time			0
" we 've actually got five lines and used to have three shifts a day , " @entity52 told @entity1 during a factory tour this week			0
" now we 've got only one shift like three days a week			0
" production is down because the plant can no longer ship products to and through @entity21			0
and costs are up because of the same economic isolation : the factory used to send a tanker truck to the @entity21 border to buy @entity95 that is critical to soda production			0
now it pays five times as much for gas smuggled into @entity0 from @entity101			1
" they just want to control @entity0 , " he said			1
" they want to control people			0
they want to control the economy			2
they want to control everything			0
" welcome to the great @entity32 divide			1
president @entity29 took note of this thursday , while in @entity111 to meet with @entity113 president @entity112			1
@entity112 and the @entity115 movement he leads run the @entity116 ; @entity0 is run by @entity6			1
@entity29 paid tribute to the stronger economy in the @entity116 and said it " stands in stark contrast to the misery and depression so many @entity32 continue to confront in @entity0			1
" @entity111 is hardly a boomtown , but it is a galaxy apart from @entity0			1
walking through @entity111 and @entity0 , political differences become real the outdoor produce market is busy , coffee shops are packed with students and young professionals , luxury cars are not uncommon , and atms from nine @entity58 banks sit side by side to compete for business at the entrance to a @entity111 shopping mall			1
@entity135 is a businessman and consultant who helped build the mall			0
sure , he says , @entity111 is better than @entity0			1
but he said that is far from good enough			0
and like @entity52 in @entity0 , @entity135 blames @entity21			1
" @entity21 has now had the leisure to pick and choose how much restriction it puts on the various @entity32 areas , " @entity135 said			2
" but that does n't mean @entity111 is n't under military occupation			2
we very much are in a cage , and around this cage is either @entity21 settlements or military checkpoints			0
" @entity32 see @entity21 ' growth ' as roadblock @entity135 lives in @entity111 but was raised in @entity152 , @entity153			1
he is an @entity154 citizen who twice cast an absentee ballot for @entity29 , but he believes the presidential visit here now is a mistake			2
opinion : @entity29 's @entity21 trip is about legacy " coming and going without bringing any kind of political movement is emboldening @entity21 , " he said			1
" and emboldening @entity21 with this new right wing government means more settlements , means more potential collapse for @entity32 society			2
" back in @entity0 , @entity168 prefers not to talk politics , but says he wishes the economics of peace would take hold			2
@entity168 owns a furniture factory within eyeshot of the @entity0 - @entity21 border and can point out the gate through which not too long ago his products were shipped to @entity21			2
now @entity21 wo n't allow it and the border industrial park is a wasteland			0
once home to about 100 factories and warehouses , locals say it now just has five in daily operation			0
to pass through is to see mostly abandoned or shuttered buildings in a bleak no - man 's land under the watchful gaze of @entity21 surveillance balloons			2
@entity168 once operated in three buildings ; he rents two now to the @entity191			0
ask @entity168 if he blames @entity21 , and he notes that he speaks fluent @entity192 , and shows @entity1 company stationery in @entity192 , to make it easier to do business with his former @entity21 customers			0
sure , he says @entity21 shares responsibility			0
but he says @entity6 does , too			2
he had 150 workers before @entity6 came to power in @entity0 ; just 20 now			1
the price , he says , of mistrust and hate .			0

@entity0 , a @entity32 **territory** , is controlled by @entity6
the @entity116 , another @entity32 **territory** , is controlled by the @entity115 movement
@entity111 in the @entity116 is hardly boomtown , but it is a galaxy apart from @entity0
president @entity29 paid tribute thursday to the @entity116 's stronger economy
