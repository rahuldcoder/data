@entity0 businessmen fear the move could dramatically affect trade between the two neighbors			1
according to @entity0 government statistics , bilateral trade between @entity0 and @entity5 more than tripled between 2006 and 2010 , as @entity41 and @entity42 signed a free trade agreement and removed visa requirements for each others ' citizens			1
" there is fear , " said @entity47 , an official involved in foreign trade at the @entity49 in @entity50 , a @entity0 province bordering @entity5			1
