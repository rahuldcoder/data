-- it 's not often that a superyacht is inspired by the work of an obscure 19th - century @entity5 mathematician			1
but the astonishingly shaped " @entity7 " is exactly that			0
still at the design stage , the 125 - meter vessel is adorned with a complex lattice exterior that its designer , @entity13 industrial architect @entity14 , says is based on an algorithmic diagram by @entity16 , a math professor who lived under the @entity18 empire during the late 1800s			1
" what is special about the @entity7 diagram is that we also notice it in nature , " said @entity14 , who is riding high after winning the @entity19 for an equally eccentric concept inspired by coral reefs and tropical fish			1
" if you look at the wings of a dragonfly , the cell membrane of a plant or the fur of a giraffe , for instance , you see the @entity7 pattern over and over , " said @entity14			2
the 32 year - old designer believes that the unusual exterior would appeal to those looking for a superyacht more in harmony with its natural surroundings			2
" structures based on the @entity7 pattern have an organic , playful , non-repetitive feel , " said @entity14 , who also argued that the pattern can create very robust structures with a minimum amount of material , and for this reason is often employed in architecture and engineering			2
just never before on a luxury yacht			0
but the " @entity7 's " quirks do n't stop at the exterior			0
set across five decks , the design includes an indoor swimming pool lined with ancient @entity59 - styled columns , a sky - lounge , botanical garden and even a small golfing range			1
so will it ever be built ? " i certainly hope so , " said @entity14 , who admitted that its non-repetitive structure is an impediment to manufacturers because each segment requires different moulds			0
he added : " for future yacht designs i will focus on the commercial market ... however it is n't easy , i like futuristic yachts much more ! "			0

concept inspired by work of @entity5 mathematician who *formalized* pattern in diagram
design also contains indoor swimming pool , botanical garden and even a golf range
