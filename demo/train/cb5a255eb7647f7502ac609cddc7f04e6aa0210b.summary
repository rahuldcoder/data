-- a $ 54.5 million program meant to cut gang violence in @entity3 left out some of the most violent communities and failed to account for how the money was spent , according to a critical audit report released this week			1
the @entity7 , or @entity8 , which was highly touted by @entity10 gov. @entity9 , suffered from what the state auditor general 's report calls " pervasive deficiencies " in " planning , implementation and management " of the program			1
the nri was supposed to be overseen by the @entity19 , or @entity20			0
the report , which was publicly released tuesday , criticized the state agency for poor oversight and said the program was rolled out too soon			0
" we noted a significant number of internal control weaknesses and instances of noncompliance related to grant awarding , administration and monitoring including missing documentation , incomplete and untimely application review or approvals ... untimely and incomplete monitoring reports lacking approval dates , lack of site visits , unapproved budget reallocations and untimely recovery of unspent grant funds , " the audit report said			0
@entity10 set up the nri program with 23 lead agencies , which contracted with smaller community groups to provide services			1
as of january , the audit had found $ 2 million in unspent funds that the state could not explain			1
examining a sample of the agencies participating in the program , state auditors " questioned 40 percent of the @entity8 expenses , " the report said			0
in many cases , there was missing documentation and receipts that did not match the amounts submitted by the state for reimbursement			0
a @entity0 investigation in december 2012 found that the nri program paid at - risk teens to hand out fliers promoting inner peace , take field trips to museums , march in a parade with the governor and even attend a yoga class to learn how to handle stress			1
critics said the program was a way for @entity9 to boost his gubernatorial race in 2010 since he announced the anti-violence initiative just one month before the election			1
two years after the program was implemented , there was a 20 % increase in murders in @entity3			0
the number of murders went down last year			0
supporters said the program kept teens off the streets of @entity3 's most dangerous neighborhoods			1
but the audit found that the communities selected by the program " were not all the most violent in terms of total crime in the @entity3 area			1
" of the 20 most violent neighborhoods in @entity3 , seven were excluded from the program , the report found			2
judge rules @entity3 gun ban is unconstitutional in an e-mail to @entity0 , a spokesman for the @entity10 governor wrote that the issues raised in the audit were resolved more than a year ago			1
" when the governor 's office became aware of the issues with @entity20 in 2012 , the administration acted quickly and , working with the attorney general 's office and the @entity111 , passed legislation to have @entity113 ( the @entity114 ) take over the authority , " the e-mail said			1
" the @entity113 has taken major steps to ensure responsible management of this critical violence prevention program and this issue has since been resolved			2
we are committed to providing effective work and educational opportunities for our youth to help prevent violence in communities across @entity10			2
" but that is n't enough for some @entity128 lawmakers			0
they have asked for further review of the nri program as well as freezing any unspent money , which they said could be as much as $ 33 million			1
" i 've spent 32 years in law enforcement , and the information i 'm looking at is the kind of information indictments are made of , " said @entity10 state sen. @entity134 , @entity135			2
" this warrants , in my estimation , a criminal investigation			0
" calling the nri program a " shameful waste of taxpayers ' dollars , " state sen. @entity143 said there was " no documentation , no monitoring , no attempt to recover funds			0
we need to get this information to the appropriate law enforcement authorities and freeze the spending			0
" most of the funding for the program was from the governor 's discretionary fund , with the remainder from general reserve funds			2
@entity9 told @entity0 in a 2012 interview that he had to do something because of the crime rate			2
" it does work when you intervene when you keep people on a positive path , doing good things for their community instead of getting involved with gangbangers and drug dealers that afflict many communities , and use violence to kill children in particular , " @entity9 said .			0
