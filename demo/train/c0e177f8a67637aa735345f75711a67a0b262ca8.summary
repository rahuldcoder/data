@entity0 -- six months after a gunman burst into a @entity4 , @entity5 , elementary school and slaughtered 20 children and killed six others , promises of stricter national gun control laws remain largely unfulfilled			1
and though the families of those lost made yet another pilgrimage to @entity0 this week to plead for action in meetings with the two top @entity16 , it is highly unlikely that lawmakers will act			1
after the meeting wednesday , house speaker @entity18 said the discussions were " very good			0
" @entity18 declined to say much more about the discussion with the group , but majority leader @entity23 , who was also at the meeting , told reporters , " i was struck again by the incredible pain that they are going through			0
i just ca n't imagine as a parent that kind of pain			0
my heart goes out to them			0
" backers of gun control proposals were unable to advance legislation in the @entity36 centered on expanded background checks earlier this year , even after a high - profile push			1
the @entity16 never took up the measures			1
president @entity40 lashed out when the @entity36 effort faltered , calling the defeat a " pretty shameful day for @entity0			0
" the political climate is n't right			1
politically vulnerable moderate @entity44 eyeing the 2014 midterm elections do n't want to risk political capital by voting to pass both an immigration overhaul and comprehensive gun control legislation , said @entity1 senior political analyst @entity49			1
@entity52 mayor @entity51 's recent move to discourage funding the four @entity44 senators who voted against shoring up background checks on gun sales will largely amount to a " symbolic " gesture , @entity49 said			2
two of the four -- sen. @entity57 , @entity58 , and sen. @entity59 , @entity60 , -- are facing re-election in 2014			2
leading democrats are also dubious about the overall impact of such a move			0
" the only way to pass a background check bill is to maintain a @entity44 majority in the @entity36 , and any efforts that make that less likely are counterproductive , " said @entity65 , a spokesman for @entity36 majority leader @entity66			2
" ninety percent of @entity44 agree with the 90 % of @entity71 who support background checks , and a @entity75 majority would guarantee that no background check bill passes in the foreseeable future , " he said			2
there 's also no incentive for the @entity75 - controlled @entity16 to take up gun control as an issue			1
that chamber 's leaders have said they wo n't bring the matter up until the @entity36 acts			0
in either case , it seems as if the nation has moved on			0
though national polls taken after the @entity4 shooting showed that roughly 90 % of @entity71 supported some form of universal background checks , less than half of those polled were upset by the @entity36 's failure to pass that type of measure , according to a @entity99 / @entity98 poll			1
" i 'm afraid the moment has probably passed , " @entity49 said			0
after the @entity4 shooting , gun control advocates redoubled their efforts with a nation mourning the loss of school children			1
the issue also galvanized the @entity40 administration			0
however , they have thus - far been outmatched by efforts of a powerful gun lobby and a motivated and vocal interest group , the @entity111 , said @entity112 , co-director of the @entity113			1
however , this year 's defeat may could still result in eventual legislative change , @entity112 said			0
in the absence of congressional action on a slate of gun control measures ranging from an assault weapons ban to expanded background checks , many states have taken matters into their own hands			1
while some states like @entity5 and @entity52 have strengthened laws , others have done the opposite			1
undaunted by congressional inaction , the @entity16 is still pushing for tighter laws			1
vice president @entity131 recently shared his confidence that @entity133 will act with fellow @entity44 in an e-mail and chastised @entity75 during a recent fundraiser for not supporting expanded background checks for gun sales			2
@entity131 is also holding a gun control event at the @entity16 next week			1
@entity131 , a former senator , and @entity66 are also reportedly in talks on how best to resurrect related legislation			2
" i am not going to bring up a vote just to have a vote , " @entity66 said last week			0
" i want to bring up this vote again if we can accomplish something that seems pretty common sense to me			0
if you have severe mental problems or you are a criminal you should n't be able to buy a gun			2
that 's what , i agree with 90 % of the @entity71 people , we should get this done			0
" @entity1 's @entity154 contributed to this report .			0

six months after @entity4 , gun - control legislation has *stalled* despite *public* support
*competing* political *agendas* , re-election concerns make it unlikely it will be *revisited*
states have since *enacted* their own laws in the wake of congressional inaction
@entity16 still pushing for new limits in *response* to school , other mass shootings
