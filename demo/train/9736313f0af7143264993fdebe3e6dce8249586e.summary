ever feel overwhelmed by worries ? do you find yourself dwelling on concerns big ? it 's official : you 're human and living in the @entity7			1
anxiety levels in this country are the highest they 've been in seven decades , surveys show			1
not surprisingly , money and work woes top most people 's freak - out lists ( thank you , lingering recession )			1
all that e-mailing , texting , and tweeting are n't helping ; social technology has reduced actual face time ( a known stress reliever ) and made us compulsively available to everyone at all times			1
women suffer most -- we 're twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder , which involves excessive worry about a wide range of things ( and requires medical attention )			1
" women are more likely to feel responsible for taking care of others ' well - being , " says @entity32 , director of the @entity33 and author of " the @entity35 : seven steps to stop worry from stopping you			1
" and in this you - can - do - it ! era , some of us think we can power through anxiety , which only exacerbates the problem			1
chronic stress has been linked to weight gain , depression , and even cancer			1
but this does n't have to be your fate			2

@entity62 : 7 steps to instant calm what is @entity57 , anyway ? @entity57 centers on the idea that we can free ourselves from a lot of angst by becoming aware of our distorted view of situations , particularly stressful ones , and adjusting our behaviors accordingly			2
a 2012 review concluded that @entity57 can enlarge the prefrontal cortex -- the part of the brain associated with weighing thoughts and making decisions -- and reduce the size of the amygdala , the region associated with stress and fear			1
in another study of patients with social phobia that compared the effects of @entity57 and the antidepressant citalopram , both treatments triggered changes in the parts of the brain that help us process , and act upon , fears			2
" our brains are constantly being shaped , most often unwittingly , " says @entity98 , director of the @entity99 at the @entity100			2
" but there are things we can do to purposefully shape them and reduce anxiety			1
" you can try @entity57 on your own with the exercises that follow , or , for a more in - depth experience , find a therapist who specializes in it			1
the more you incorporate these very doable techniques into your life , the more second nature they 'll become when anxious thoughts rear their ugly little heads			1
try them all , then do the ones that work best daily ; in about two weeks , you 'll start to see a calmer , happier you			2
@entity62 : which type of talk therapy is best for you ? stay calm now , worry later " much of feeling anxious is that sense of urgency : ' i 've got to know -- is this mole cancer ? ' " @entity32 notes			1
" but research shows that 85 % of things people worry about actually end up having a positive or neutral outcome			2
" write down exactly what 's worrying you , then do n't look at your note again for three or five hours			2
chances are , it will feel less worrisome , and you 'll be better able to consider productive actions , like scheduling a skin check at the dermatologist			2
think small too often , anxieties swell to epic size : i 'll never get out of debt ! " things feel more manageable when you remove worry 's distortions , " notes @entity141 , author of " freeing yourself from @entity143			0
" take it step by step instead : i ca n't pay off all the bills now , but i can chip away at them every month			0
@entity62 : 9 things to stop worrying about give yourself a pep talk write down or say out loud the ways you are prepared to handle a situation : i generally get things done			0
i know how to ask for help			0
remind yourself how capable you are			0
let @entity160 help imagine the issue from an outside perspective , @entity141 suggests			0
what would your best friend -- or your favorite celebrity -- say ? conjure up that person 's voice as they guide you to calm			0
@entity160 : listen , woman , that ceo has a bark much bigger than his bite			0
you 've totally got this			0
you : you are so right			0
use your senses mindfulness , an ancient practice that focuses your brain on the present , is as old as @entity180			1
but it 's experiencing a surge of popularity ; companies like @entity185 and @entity186 have mindfulness programs for employees			0
like @entity57 , it conditions your mind to be more stress - resistant			1
in a 2012 study , students trained in a mindfulness technique had a significant decrease in stress - related cortisol and an increase in signaling connections ( called axons ) in a part of the brain that controls emotions			1
@entity62 : head - to - toe solutions for stress " when we feel anxiety , our thoughts are rarely in the present , " says @entity205 , a cognitive behavioral therapist in @entity207			1
" we are either ruminating about past mistakes or worrying about future consequences			0
" zooming in on what you can see , hear , taste , smell , or feel shifts your mind to the present			0
the more you practice this , the better equipped you 'll be when anxiety strikes , and the quicker you 'll calm down			1
try this four - step exercise : 1			2
with eyes closed , imagine yourself and your surroundings from above			0
how does the floor , mat , or chair feel ? how 's the temperature in the room ? 3			0
what are the sounds ? maybe an electrical appliance is humming , or trees outside are rustling			0
now tune into all these things at once			0
hard , right ? that 's the point -- to fill your thoughts with the present			0
when your mind wanders ( and it will ) , bring it back to your senses			0
it may just bring -- as famously said on " @entity244 " -- serenity now .			0
