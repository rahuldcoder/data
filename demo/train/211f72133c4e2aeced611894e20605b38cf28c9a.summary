elephants are being killed in @entity1 at an alarming rate by increasingly efficient and well - armed poachers as international demand soars for the ivory from their tusks , wildlife conservation groups say			1
the slaughter , described by some activists as unprecedented , is enabled by ineffective law enforcement , official corruption , porous borders and a rapidly expanding population seeking sustenance , the groups say			1
and it is being driven by a growing appetite for ivory products in increasingly affluent @entity20 countries , particularly @entity21 and @entity22			1
" @entity21 has taken over @entity23 as the world 's largest ivory consumer			1
and from 2006 to last year , the ivory price in @entity21 has tripled			1
so that 's why some @entity21 buy ivory products in @entity1 with dollars and smuggle them back to @entity21 to sell for a better price , " said @entity27 , @entity20 regional director for the @entity28			1
but @entity33 spokesman @entity32 said his government has taken a firm stance on ivory trafficking			1
" we have enacted corresponding laws and regulations , and made significant efforts in enforcing them , " he said			2
" we have made positive contributions to tackling ivory trafficking activities worldwide			1
we will keep this momentum going in our future work			0
" african elephant slaughter highest in more than two decades @entity47 said the @entity21 government has done a " great job " in banning online trade of ivory products , ordering online shopping sites to remove such items and closing ivory trade websites			1
but she said that while 136 @entity21 retailers are authorized to sell ivory products , many more illegal stores have set up shop , according to @entity28 investigations			2
the numbers available are stark : the poaching of elephants is the most intense it has been in a decade , and the number of documented ivory seizures has reached its highest level since 1989 , a group of agencies that monitor elephant populations and the ivory trade said in june			2
the elephant population in @entity1 , where the worst of the killing is believed to be taking place , has dropped significantly over the past 10 years , according to estimates cited by @entity75 , head of field programs for the conservation organization @entity77 in the @entity79 region			1
the level of butchery is a throwback to the 1980s , when an estimated 100,000 elephants were being killed every year , according to @entity77			0
the convention on @entity85 and @entity86 in 1989 outlawed the international ivory trade and sharply reduced illegal killing in some countries			2
the chief reason for the deteriorating situation today is the rising demand in @entity20 and the weak law enforcement against poachers and illegal ivory traders in @entity97 countries like the @entity98 and the @entity97 , @entity75 said			1
@entity99 is being done to prosecute the people in those countries who run the ivory trade , he said , largely because they are often local government officials who use their authority to sidestep inspections and intimidate law enforcement agents			1
@entity106 bans shipping of shark products " they do n't hunt themselves , but they use their government status , and indeed their government vehicles , to organize the crime behind the scenes , " said @entity75 , who has spent 16 years working in the region			0
wildlife wardens in rural areas can have little incentive to risk their publicly funded jobs by pursuing and prosecuting powerful local officials , he said			0
the money to be made from killing elephants for a living is also tempting for many people in the region , where population growth is rapid and poverty rates are high			0
" with the price of ivory skyrocketing over the past few years , it becomes a very lucrative business for local people , " @entity128 said			2
the wildlife wardens are often outgunned by the poachers , whose growing use of automatic firearms and other weapons has been documented by conservation groups			2
they are also now confronting not just local poachers , but also seasoned fighters from war - torn areas of the continent like @entity145 , conservationists say			0
once the ivory has been harvested from the slaughtered elephants , it is transported across thinly and badly policed borders to ports in countries like @entity152 and @entity153			0
from the trading hubs , it is shipped abroad , mainly to @entity20			0
" most illegal shipments of african elephant ivory end up in either @entity21 or @entity22 , " according to @entity158 , an organization that monitors the wildlife trade			1
the biggest demand is from @entity21 , @entity75 said , where ivory household items , like chopsticks , are increasingly sought after by tens of millions of people newly enriched by the country 's past decade of meteoric economic growth			1
@entity166 is also purchased as a collector 's item or for investment , @entity47 said			0
@entity22 is also a good market for the criminal gangs that traffic the ivory because it is a popular tourist destination with weak laws governing the sale of ivory products and lax policing , according to @entity128			2
despite the bleak situation , efforts are under way to clamp down on the illegal trade , as the increase in elephant killing damages governments ' credibility and , in the case of incursions by foreign poachers , presents possible security threats			0
some @entity97 countries are starting to share information about poaching between them , @entity75 said			0
and @entity194 has joined efforts to investigate those involved in the trade of ivory and other illicit wildlife products			0
the @entity199 government has also been " extremely active in the @entity79 region in putting pressure on governments to take this issue seriously , " according to @entity128			0
" there is light as well as darkness , " he said			0
will elephants still roam earth in 20 years ?			0
