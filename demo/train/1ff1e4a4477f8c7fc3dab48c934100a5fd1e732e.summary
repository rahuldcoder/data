-- i grew up in an interfaith home where i learned , despite what some on the far right allege today , that @entity3 and @entity4 have much in common			2
my father was @entity7 and born in the 1930s in what was then known as @entity10			1
my mother is @entity12 ( @entity13 , to be accurate ) and proudly @entity14			0
my family was the embodiment of the @entity16 : an immigrant father and first generation mother of differing ethnicities and faiths , who did more than just co-exist : they flourished			0
our mini " melting pot " succeeded because we focused on the commonalities between @entity3 and @entity4 , the most obvious being that we worship the same @entity25			0
how could we not ? after all , we share almost identical prophets such as @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			0
my @entity7 cousins would even celebrate @entity32 with us every year - - not only to be social , but because there 's a religious basis			1
to @entity7 , @entity30 is a prophet referred to in the @entity35 as " @entity36 , " born of the @entity37 , who was herself born of immaculate conception			1
growing up in @entity41 in the 1980s , no one expressed any issues with our heritage or faith			1
in fact , in third grade my teacher asked me to bring my father to school for " show and tell " so the students could meet an @entity53 @entity7 man			1
i can only imagine if this event was replicated today , some would protest , claiming my father was there trying to spread sharia law or convert the children to @entity3			0
despite my upbringing in a very ethnic home , by september 11 , 2001 , i identified as a typical white @entity61			1
i was n't @entity62 , the @entity63 , i was just @entity62			1
as i have joked in my stand - up act , i did n't have any @entity53 friends before 9/11			1
all my friends had names like @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
but as i stood on the corner of @entity72 and @entity73 in @entity74 on that fateful september morning watching in horror as the towers crumbled before my eyes , i knew all our lives would change			0
i just never could have predicted the trajectory my own life would take			0
soon after 9/11 , i found that my membership in " @entity83 " had been revoked			1
i was now a minority , which , truthfully , was not something i wanted to be			0
i 'm not saying being a white person in @entity61 is easy , but being a minority in @entity61 is a completely different kind of challenge , for the simple reason that as a minority you are n't only responsible for yourself , you are also called to answer for the sins of the worst in your minority group			1
in time i began to embrace my @entity53 roots			0
i soon decided to use my comedy , whenever possible , to counter the misconceptions my fellow @entity61 harbored about @entity53 and @entity7			1
now , 10 years after 9/11 , i have grown accustomed to and even enjoy my minority status			0
but i do have a grave concern : i have never witnessed more @entity100 rhetoric espoused by politicians , religious leaders and in media outlets than i do today			2
not even in the days after 9/11			0
there was a time in our nation 's history when if you wanted to demonize a religion or race , you had to wear a white sheet over your head			0
indeed , peddlers of hate would n't want to cover their face because they want people to know who they are so they can sell more books , secure more well paying speaking engagements , and appear more often on television			2
( i 'm looking at you @entity122 ! ) but i 'm fully confident this will pass			0
in fact , i have already observed encouraging signs			0
recently , the nonprofit @entity126 , an organization created in 1971 to expose the activities of hate groups , listed leaders of the @entity7 hate movement in the same league as @entity132 , the @entity133 , and the @entity134			1
thankfully , this begins the marginalization of these @entity7 hate groups to the fringes of @entity61 society where they justly belong			1
more interfaith alliances between @entity7 , @entity14 and @entity142 have been formed			2
in fact , @entity144 's national magazine features a cover story this month designed to dispel misconceptions about @entity3 and bring @entity148 and @entity7 closer together			2
( some forget that right - wing @entity61 had alleged that @entity148 and democracy could not exist together and that a @entity152 candidate for president -- @entity151 -- would , if elected , follow the directives of the pope , not the @entity156			1
) this week , the national @entity159 published an editorial entitled , " @entity164 , " imploring @entity142 @entity61 to reject the extremist voices of hate that target @entity61 @entity7 and specifically called on , by name , the few @entity142 people involved in the @entity7 hate movement to stop			1
we must stand together today as @entity61 , just as we did in 2001 after the attacks			2
we can not allow those who promote hate , either here or abroad , to divide our nation			0
as then presidential candidate @entity151 cautioned @entity61 in 1960 while defending himself against @entity175 attacks : " today , i may be the victim , but tomorrow it may be you -- until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity62 .			2

@entity62 says he grew up an @entity61 in @entity41 with @entity7 dad , @entity152 mom
he says after september 11 he found others now saw him as a *suspicious* muslim
he says hate groups profit from @entity100 speech , but they are starting to be marginalized
@entity62 : on 9/11 in particular we ca n't allow others to blind us to our commonality
