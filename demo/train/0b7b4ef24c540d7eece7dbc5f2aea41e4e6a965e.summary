-- @entity1 wrecked any chance of a @entity4 comeback in their @entity6 quarterfinal return with a second half equaliser as @entity8 drew 1 - 1 for an emphatic 5 - 1 aggregate win			1
@entity4 scorer @entity10 embraces @entity8 's @entity11 after @entity4 's @entity13 exit			2
@entity15 leaders @entity8 arrived in @entity16 with a comfortable first leg cushion and will now host @entity18 in their semifinal first leg at the @entity20 on april 28			1
no side in the tournament 's history had overturned a four goal deficit and @entity4 were always up against it			0
" we were much better in the personal duels , things were a bit more normal , and we played the way you need to against such a good team , " said @entity16 defender @entity25			0
" but unfortunately we have still lost the tie			0
" and @entity4 president @entity34 -- who was scathing after the first - leg debacle -- said the @entity36 had gone some way to redemption			2
" i think the team has rehabilitated itself , although @entity8 's equalising goal was needlessly conceded " , said @entity34			0
after going close in the first - half , @entity10 finally unpicked the @entity8 defense on 47 minutes before @entity1 equalised for the @entity43 with less than 20 minutes left			1
no @entity43 side has ever won the treble of league , @entity47 and @entity6 , but @entity8 are on course to take all three titles as coach @entity50 hopes to lead the @entity43 to a third @entity13 title after 1992 and 2006			1

@entity4 coach @entity66 was booed by his own fans before kick - off , but this result on the back of the weekend 's 4 - 0 win over @entity72 in the @entity36 league will have taken some of the pressure off the @entity77 coach .			1
