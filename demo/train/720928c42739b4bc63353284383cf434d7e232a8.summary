-- less than two months before the world focuses on @entity3 for the @entity4 , president @entity1 is handing out " get out of jail free " cards			1
a new amnesty law introduced by @entity1 allowed two members of @entity3 punk band @entity9 to leave prison on monday , two months before the end of their two - year sentences for a performance critical of the president			1
in addition , 30 @entity16 demonstrators could go free under the amnesty law passed by @entity3 lawmakers last week that could affect 25,000 prisoners			1
@entity1 also pardoned former oil tycoon and @entity23 critic @entity22 , who had been jailed since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud			1
it all is part of a public relations offensive by @entity1 , who has solidified his political dominance in @entity3 and now seeks to improve the country 's image ahead of the @entity31 that begin february 7 in the @entity33 city of @entity34			1
the amnesty law and the @entity22 release " are to a certain extent tied to the upcoming @entity38 , " said @entity0 foreign affairs correspondent @entity35			2
@entity3 's international image has suffered from an anti-gay law passed under @entity1 , with threats of protests and boycotts at the @entity38 over its bans on " homosexual propaganda			1
" in addition , the jailing of @entity22 harmed foreign investment in @entity3 because it smacked of political repression , @entity35 noted			2
" @entity3 wants to improve its image and increase investment in the country , " she said , adding that @entity22 's imprisonment " caused some businesses to think twice about " getting involved in @entity3			1
@entity3 has faced international criticism for its treatment of @entity22 , once @entity3 's richest man , with countries including the @entity61 accusing it of " selective prosecution " and abuse of the legal system			1
he became both a political and economic threat to @entity1 by wanting to create a commercial oil pipeline that would break the government monopoly on the industry and by funding opposition politicians , @entity35 said			1
@entity22 , who was due for release next year , wrote @entity1 a letter from prison that asked for early release because his mother was ailing			0
he insisted the letter contained no admission of guilt , and @entity1 said the pardon was on humanitarian grounds			0
upon his release , @entity22 left the country and has said he wo n't continue his political activities against the @entity3 government			0
" @entity1 really believes that he 's basically crushed the opposition , that he does n't have to worry about them anymore , " @entity35 said , calling the move a commentary on @entity3 society that now has relative political stability after major anti-government demonstrations in 2011			1
" he may well think that he 's had some victory over the opposition			0
" the government linked the new amnesty law to the anniversary of the 1993 adoption of @entity3 's @entity98 constitution			1
however , the @entity9 performers , @entity100 and @entity101 , called it a publicity stunt aimed at improving @entity3 's image ahead of the @entity4			1
" president @entity1 obviously used this amnesty option to ( brighten ) up his image before the @entity31 , " said @entity105 , the husband of @entity101			2
" two months out of the almost two years that the girls have served is not much , " he said			0
" so the effect of this amnesty for @entity100 and @entity101 is not really felt			0
" @entity9 's 2012 performance of a " punk prayer " at a @entity115 cathedral criticized @entity1 , who was prime minister at the time			2
the musicians were found guilty of hooliganism			0
according to @entity3 media , @entity100 and @entity101 qualified for amnesty under the new law because they have young children			2
the @entity9 case made headlines around the world , as did the anti-gay law passed in july that banned " propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors			0
" it bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it -- and has been condemned by @entity3 and international rights groups as highly discriminatory			0
critics say it is so vague that wearing a rainbow t - shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex could bring prosecution			0
last week , @entity1 defended the new law as necessary to defend the conservative @entity3 society from " values which are received in a difficult way by our citizens			2
" asked about the issue by @entity0 's @entity35 at a news conference , @entity1 said the law was n't about criticizing anyone , but instead involved " protecting us from rather aggressive behavior from some social groups who , in my opinion , are trying to impose their points of view in a rather aggressive way			2
" in an apparent jab at the anti-gay laws , the @entity61 announced last week that its delegation to the @entity38 will include openly gay athletes such as tennis legend @entity165 and hockey player @entity166			0
no member of president @entity169 's family or current @entity170 will attend			0
@entity0 's @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			0
