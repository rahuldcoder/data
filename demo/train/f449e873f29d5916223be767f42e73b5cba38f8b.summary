-- there 's a moment , when singer lp performs the song " @entity4 , " that her face tightens and she purses her lips , even as she keeps singing			1
it happened show after show at the @entity11 music festival , whether on sunny daytime stages , in dark clubs , or while rocking a ukulele , solo , in the middle of an @entity18 , @entity17 , street			2
she is trying not to smile			2
she knows the line that will make people recognize the song , and its singer			1
maybe they saw her belt it at @entity28 in @entity29 , or they 're among the millions that watched it on @entity32 , or they remember how it burst from a @entity35 commercial as a rock climber ascended a 400 - foot sandstone tower : " somebody left the gate open , you know we got lost on the way			1
" those big notes give her away : not @entity46 , songwriter , but @entity48 , the singer crowds have heard , but never heard of			1
the artist , whose cd / dvd , " @entity4 , " debuts tuesday ; who 'll be on " @entity52 " on wednesday ; and whose album with @entity55 producer @entity54 will come out later this year			1
always after that line , she knows , the murmurs start			2
" i see a few of them , every time , look at their friend and go , ' ohhhh			2
' it 's kind of funny and embarrassing at the same time , " @entity48 said during an interview at @entity11			1
" the singing , the recognition -- they were n't part of any big plan			2
@entity46 's dad was a lawyer			1
her mom sang opera , but gave it up when she had a family			2
growing up in @entity74 , they listened to oldies , not pop radio			1
but after her mom passed away in 1997 , @entity46 finished high school , moved to @entity78 and found music was what made her happy			1
" i did n't know anybody , i did n't have any connections , " she said			2
" the first time i wrote a song , i could n't really believe -- ' can you just do that ? you 're just allowed ? ' i never thought about songs on the radio , and who wrote them			1
" she was first signed as an artist on @entity93 , then @entity94			0
the deals never shook out , but she gained a reputation as a writer who could churn out dozens of tunes to suit any voice or sound			0
she wrote @entity102 's " @entity101 ) " and chunks of @entity105 's album , " superficial			1
" @entity106 and @entity107 cut her work			1
there are songs in the works with @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 from @entity115			0
writing was so demanding that she left @entity74 in 2010 and moved to @entity29			0
she 'd show up to sessions with a ukulele -- a $ 60 instrument she 'd taught herself to play using @entity123 songs posted online -- and strung together melodies and lyrics that worked			0
creating pop for other people made her understand what songs need , she said , but as an artist turned writer , she was compassionate			1
she understood what it was like to sit in a room with people trying to decide your voice and put words in your mouth			0
" i was having a nice anonymous little time as a writer , " she said			0
" i really was on the writer path			0
i was sort of minding my own business			0
i loved making a living in music			0
" sometimes , for fun , she 'd show up at @entity149 , @entity150 or @entity28 in @entity29 for one - or two - song cover sets -- " @entity152 " by @entity153 , " @entity154 " by @entity155 , " @entity156 " by @entity157 or " @entity162 , " the @entity161 version @entity159 remade			1
the crowds at music industry hangouts always liked her ; she was one of them			1
one night , when it seemed right , she pulled out her ukulele and played " @entity4 " on stage			1
she remembers people chanting her name , once adopted just for convenience , later because it felt right : not @entity46 -- @entity48			1
" when i 'm behind a big song , i feel like i can do big things , " she said			2
that moment was a big one			0
she signed to @entity177 ( which is owned by @entity0 's parent company , @entity179 ) , found managers she trusted , and began to think more about what her sound should be -- not what others wanted , or what other singers needed , but what hit all the highs and lows in her vocal range and personality			2
" the thrill of writing songs for other people , when you get that right , that person 's soul speaks to that song , you 've done them a favor and the world a favor , " she said			1
" that 's what writing is all about -- you 're always trying to get the real picture			2
" i wrote a bunch of songs i feel only i can sing			0
" it 's not an anonymous life now			2
for long days at @entity11 , @entity46 had managers , pr people , photographers and a band around her			0
the singer had a signature look -- a pillow of tight black curls around her face , broken - in black boots , simple silver jewelry			0
she also had about seven black jackets that all looked more or less the same			0
she looked on the outside like she feels on the inside , @entity48 said , and finally has the instruments and stage to express it			1
crowds piled in to see her in @entity18 , or stopped to listen when they heard the line , one they all recognized			0
they 'd always look up to see the person it was coming from			0
maybe it all looks like a character , @entity48 said -- the new city , the name change , the uniform , the ukulele			1
but she knows now which songs are hers			0
" i think everybody needs to find out who they are and who their , like , inner superhero is , or who you like to be , " she said			0
" the world would be a better place if everyone was doing what the hell they wanted to do and being who they wanted to be			0
" i hope they do			0
