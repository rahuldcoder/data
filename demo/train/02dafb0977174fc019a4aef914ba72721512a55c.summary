@entity0 -- @entity2 won his first medal in gymnastics when he was 9			1
but he did n't hold onto that medal for long , giving it to another boy in the competition who was in tears after being teased for a bad performance			1
" he walked over to the kid that they were making fun of , and he said , ' here you go , ' and he took his medal off and put it around the kid and said , ' one day you 'll be better than i am			1
do n't cry , ' " says his mother , @entity20 , who still gets choked up recalling that gesture			2
that 's what he does			0
it 's who he is			0
" that same @entity28 boy from the @entity29 is now 19 and has made it all the way to the @entity32			1
his heart is set on winning a gold medal -- this one for his country			1
he may be the best hope for a @entity38 gold medal in gymnastics in 2012			1
@entity20 says that she and her husband , @entity40 , are thrilled but not surprised their son made the @entity44 team			0
" when that little boy told us when he was 10 years old , ' i want to go to 2012 , ' we believed him			1
" @entity2 started down the path to the @entity32 when he was 7			1
his father , who was a sanitation worker , saw a flier offering free gymnastics classes and signed him up			2
@entity2 has never looked back			1
" the minute i stepped foot in the gym i just loved it			0
i knew it was what i wanted to do for a long time , " @entity2 says			1
his @entity44 dream was inspired by the @entity59 brothers at the @entity60			0
by the time he was 14 , he was fully committed to getting to the @entity61			0
" i said i really want to have that one day -- to put the gold medal around my neck , waving to the crowd , knowing that all my hard work has paid off and my dream has come true , " he said			1
gymnastics was n't a popular pursuit for a kid from the @entity29 , and he has n't forgotten the ridicule from schoolmates teasing him for " leaping around in ladies ' tights			1
" " they just did n't understand everything that went into gymnastics			1
all the work , all the hours , all the blood , sweat and tears			0
" besides , he jokes , " look at me			0
i 'm 5 - foot - 5 , 5 - foot - 4			0
can you imagine me being a basketball player ? " to get the level of coaching her son required , his mother drove him to and from a gym in @entity87 , @entity0 , an hour away , often twice a day			0
by 9 , he was training four hours daily five and often six days a week			0
" when he needed it , we 'd give him a day off , but he usually did n't want to take a day off , " his former coach @entity88 says			2
@entity88 often trained @entity2 for free since there was n't money to pay for coaching			1
" with a gymnast like that , you do n't think twice about it , " @entity88 says			2
@entity88 started having big dreams for @entity2 by the time the boy was 10			1
it 's rare to find the perfect balance of strength and grace in a boy , @entity88 says , but on top of all that , you need discipline and drive , and he says @entity2 had both			2
" people ask me if he 's a once in a lifetime gymnast , and i joke around and say he 's a once in a hundred lifetimes gymnast , " @entity88 says			0
@entity115 , his coach at the @entity38 @entity117 in @entity118 where he has been training for more than a year , says @entity2 's combination of talent , " cat - like " moves and hard work make him a contender for a medal in @entity125			1
" we 're aiming for gold			2
we 'll see what happens , " @entity128 says			0
@entity2 says he 's feeling no pressure as he faces the biggest athletic stage of his life			2
" i kind of feel like there 's more pressure at the @entity44 trials to make the team , and now it 's kind of like , it 's a sigh of relief			0
now i can just go and do my gymnastics and have fun , " he says			2
to his mother , he 's already won the gold			0
" the person that he is , the heart that he has , the dreams that he has , he 's a gold winner already so anything on top of that is just gravy , " she says .			0
