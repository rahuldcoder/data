sound familiar ? if it does , it 's because for the second year in a row , the duo clinched the top two spots for the presidential choice vote in the buzzy @entity10 straw poll			1
last year , sen. @entity1 of @entity11 beat dr. @entity3 , a renowned neurosurgeon and @entity13 contributor , by a whopping 29 %			1
on saturday , @entity1 beat @entity3 just by 5 %			1
former gov. @entity14 of @entity15 and former sen. @entity16 of @entity17 rounded out the top four , while @entity19 gov. @entity18 and @entity21 sen. @entity20 tied for fifth place with 7 % of the vote			0
to further the case that not much has changed , this year 's results for the vice presidential choice also mimicked last year 's , with @entity3 coming in first and @entity1 coming in second			1
in a small twist , @entity18 beat out rep. @entity29 for the third place title			0
she and @entity16 took the fourth and fifth place spots in the race this year			2
poll participants at the @entity10 were also asked to rank their top three most important issues			2
to little surprise amongst the conservative crowd , protecting religious liberty was deemed the most important issue by an overwhelming margin , while abortion and national security followed as the next most important issues			0
announcing the results , @entity43 , president of the @entity44 , a conservative public policy and lobbying organization that sponsors the @entity10 , noted that participation was up this year from last , likely due to the upcoming midterm election			1
" it actually shows that there is more engagement of core conservatives in the process when they have a reason to be , " @entity43 said			0
" the evidence here is quite clear , that when conservatives have someone who will speak clearly , concisely -- a conservative message that embraces all elements of conservatism -- they gain enthusiastic support			0
" voters were also allowed to write - in candidates that they thought were deserving of a vote if they were n't included in the list of 24 elected officials selected			0
notable write - ins included @entity72 evangelist and missionary @entity73 for president			0
