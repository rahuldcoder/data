the @entity33 @entity1 condemned the drone strike as " cowardly " and " barbaric " in a statement posted on their website saturday , the @entity68 said			1
the statement urged the @entity2 government and people to take measures to stop the attacks			2
@entity2 braces for reprisals there are fears the killing of @entity9 may spark a surge in violence			2
this is in part because the attack in @entity33 in 2009 -- in which seven @entity11 citizens died -- was launched in response to a strike that killed another @entity1 leader , @entity89 , four months earlier			1
the @entity90 , designated by the @entity11 as a terrorist organization , vowed to avenge @entity9 's death			2

one missile hit a compound and another struck a car nearby , the @entity2 sources said			0
this is not the first time @entity9 -- who took the reins of the @entity2 @entity1 in 2009 -- has been reported killed after a drone strike			1
in february 2010 , multiple sources said he had died after being hit in a drone strike in @entity2 a month earlier			1
but reports that he was alive surfaced in april of that year , and in may 2010 he appeared in a video in which he vowed attacks on major @entity11 cities			0
the fact that senior @entity2 government officials have commented so quickly on the news of his death this time adds credence to the reports			0
@entity2 @entity1 claimed @entity37 plot the @entity2 @entity1 , who have long been conducting an insurgency against the @entity2 government , claimed responsibility for the december 2009 suicide bombing at the @entity11 ' @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity33			1
five @entity162 officers were among the seven @entity11 citizens killed , and a member of @entity166 intelligence also died			2

@entity9 took over from @entity89 , a fellow clan member , in 2009 after the latter was killed in a @entity11 drone strike			1
peace prospects @entity9 's death could make progress in proposed peace talks between the @entity2 government and @entity2 @entity1 more difficult			1
a relatively young and charismatic leader , he held together a disparate group with different tribal and other allegiances			0
there had reportedly been talks about him being involved in peace talks with @entity2 's government			0
his killing may upset some elements within the @entity2 @entity1 if they believe that the @entity2 government was involved			1
the @entity2 @entity1 could also pose an increased security threat if they splinter into smaller groups , which could be harder for security forces to detect			1
there has been a series of suicide bombings in the region over the past couple of years			0
@entity0 's @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
