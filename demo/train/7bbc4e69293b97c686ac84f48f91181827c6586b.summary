-- imagine arriving at @entity1 in @entity2 , one of the busiest and most bustling airports in the country			1
people are dashing about , waiting at checkpoints and scanning the screens for departure and arrival times			0
invariably there are delays and since you are n't going anywhere anytime soon , you might as well enjoy the tunes playing over the public announcement system			0
hey , is n't that the @entity18 and @entity20 classic " @entity17 " ? you have n't heard that in years ! but wait , what are they singing ? it sounds like " @entity17 , " but the lyrics playing do n't match the ones you know			0
click on the image above to hear two of the airport 's new songs			1
" @entity32 fresh , @entity32 fresh , yeah , yeah @entity1 do it now @entity32 fresh , @entity32 fresh , yeah , yeah show ' em how we do it now ! show ' em how we do it now ! " welcome to parody with a purpose			1
as part of an initiative to keep the airport clean and get people excited about the airport 's new shops and dining options , officials there bought the rights to three popular @entity49 classics : " @entity17 " by @entity50 , " @entity51 " by @entity52 and the @entity53 and " @entity54 " by @entity55			1
with rights secured , @entity56 , @entity57 for the @entity59 @entity58 , rewrote the lyrics and invited the original artists to record the revamped songs			1
" whereas words reach the mind , music reaches the heart , " @entity56 said			0
" these are hit songs that people love ... real powerful , catchy and make you want to dance			1
if you can make someone dance , you can probably motivate them to do other things			0
" so " @entity79 " became " @entity80 , " " @entity81 " morphed into " we 're @entity77 , " and " @entity54 " was reborn as " @entity78			0
" clean music with a clean message -- literally			0
the concept of " opening day fresh " refers to keeping the airport as clean as if it were opening day , which means smelling fresh and looking as spotless as possible			1
the catchy tunes are a way to subtly remind visitors that it takes a team effort to keep the airport sparkling			1
" @entity78 " reminds travelers about the facility 's retail offerings and food service			1
@entity56 said much effort was put into making sure the songs were produced in such a way that they were respectful to the song and the artist			1
" the whole idea is to make it sound as much like the original as possible , " @entity56 said			1
" if it 's not really done with deft , then it kind of detracts from it rather than enhances it			2
" @entity50 , half of @entity50 , loved the idea and was pleased to remake his classic			0
" @entity113 " " was a worldwide song and people recognize the melody , " said @entity109 , who continues to perform			0
" it was fun to do and every time i come through the airport i listen to it			2
" @entity118 , lead vocalist of the group @entity55 , said @entity56 did a great job transforming " @entity54 " into a new , yet familiar song			2
" it 's important to send the message in a way that the message will get through , " @entity118 said			2
" ours is a song that people may have grown up hearing or they may have played for their kids and so you might have generations that can relate to it			0
" such messaging can be extremely effective , said @entity134 , lead scientist for @entity135 , an online financial advisory company for young adults			0
@entity134 , an expert in behavioral finance and social psychology , said the airport is obviously attempting to do something his company also aims for -- offering useful information in a way that is less stressful for the user			2
" if you put up a sign that says ' do n't litter , ' people see it the first time you put it up , but every time after that it loses its impact , because it becomes a standard part of what they see , " he said			0
" music is pervasive in a way that a sign is not because it 's everywhere			2
" @entity56 said officials at the airport definitely want those coming through to enjoy their time			2
as part of that , the airport recently launched the initial phases of a program that uses a scent called " @entity171 " to help enhance visitors ' mood			1
@entity56 said the scent , which was first tested on a limited group of passengers , uses a variety of different notes , including vanilla and a little lavender			1
the pleasant , relaxing scent is going over so well that @entity56 said a custom scent that will be exclusive to @entity1 is being developed			1
" we want to make people feel better , " he said			0
" we wanted to give them an olfactory cue which suggested that the airport is opening day fresh and we want to enhance their travel experience			2
" @entity188 , also known as @entity189 , is a travel commentator and writer who is a frequent traveler			0
anything airports can do to make air travel more relaxing is more than welcome , especially in the times we live in , she said			0
" movie theaters and restaurants have been using scents and those kinds of subliminal tactics for years , " @entity188 said			0
" music makes people feel good and with the economy the way it is , people are just stressed to no end , so from a subconscious level it 's a really wise thing for the airport to do			1

visitors to @entity59 's airport will hear some familiar classics
older *r&b* hits *reworked* to *promote* airport cleanliness
original artists *re-record* songs meant to gently prompt passengers
@entity1 also using scent to help relax visitors
