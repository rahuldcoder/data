this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : hi everyone			2
i 'm @entity18 and this is @entity0			2
we are commercial free and coming directly to your classroom from the @entity23 in @entity24			2
let 's go ahead and get things started right now			1
first up : @entity27 @entity28 : first up , remembering a day five years ago that changed the lives of thousands of @entity31 : the day that @entity32 made landfall			1
ceremonies and vigils took place all across the @entity31 @entity37 yesterday			1
there 's been a lot of progress and rebuilding since @entity32 hit , but most people agree that there 's still a lot that needs doing			1
during a visit to the @entity37 yesterday , president @entity45 talked about the struggles facing the region			2
@entity31 president @entity45 : i do n't have to tell you that there are still too many vacant and overgrown lots			1
there are still too many students attending classes in trailers			1
there are still too many people unable to find work			2
and there are still too many @entity4 folks who have n't been able to come home			1
so , while an incredible amount of progress has been made , on this fifth anniversary , i wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly , my administration is going to stand with you and fight alongside you until the job is done			2
@entity28 : if you were with us on friday , you might remember the preview we gave you of " @entity32 : then and now			1
" it 's a special project that compares @entity4 right after @entity32 hit with how the city looks five years later			1
today , we have the full report for you			1
take a look at this			2
( begin video ) @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity5 : everything was gray , just like when you saw after 9/11 where , you know , the streets were all gray			2
you could not find any greenery			2
nobody , no one coming down the street			2
it was very eerie , very eerie to be just in the silence			2
that 's what i remember , it just being so quiet			1
@entity96 , @entity97 , @entity5 : there 's nothing , nothing really changed			1
i mean , like , you have an overturned car in the middle of the street			2
yes , we moved that , but that 's it			1
like i said , the people are not coming back			2
you do n't see the commerce , and it 's like some parts of the city are still like a ghost town			1
it 's just a reality that we have			1
it 's like , hey , this is how we live and this is what we have to deal with			1
@entity119 : in the photo with the shrimp boat that is going a little ways into the house , where that boat came from i do n't know			2
but it 's at the end of a street close to a levee , which right on the other side is a body of water			1
so , i do n't know where this boat came from , but it certainly did n't belong on the street			2
@entity135 , @entity4 : i took pictures of a church			1
it was a church , basically , right behind me across the street			2
it was a two - story church with a huge set of stairs going up to it			2
and it collapsed sometime during the storm , so it was collapsed when i came back			2
the whole site has been cleared since , and now just the stairs are there			0
@entity119 : i am hoping now that people will realize they have , whatever number it is , how many died in @entity150 , how many died in the @entity151			0
but really , you 'll get to see , you know , it was n't just that weekend or those few months , it continues			1
people are still affected by what happened			0
( @entity157 ) @entity158 @entity28 : very powerful images there			0

@entity178 , the storm that came before it , made it up to a category 4 storm status , although it was back down to a category 1 by sunday afternoon			0

more than 200 people had to be rescued saturday off the coast of @entity190			0
authorities said most of them were swimmers who had gotten exhausted from fighting the currents			0
@entity194 @entity28 : moving over to @entity194 , where thousands of people are trying to get away from this : it 's a volcano , and it erupted over the weekend			1
that was kind of a surprise , since it has n't done that in more than 400 years ! around 12,000 people who live in nearby villages were evacuated			0
this volcano last erupted in the 1600s			0
officials say that because it 's been inactive for so long , they do n't know exactly what to expect			1
but , emergency response teams are on the scene			0
the @entity212 government says the situation is under control			0
experts do n't think there 's too much risk of a large , destructive eruption			1

that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! rallies in @entity7 @entity28 : you history students are familiar with the speech			1
it was one of the defining moments of the @entity255			0
in it , dr. @entity242 talked about his dream of people from different races living together peacefully and being judged by their character rather than their skin color			0

is this legit ? @entity296 , @entity15 : is this legit ? the @entity31 birth rate has gone up every year during the past decade			1
not legit ! recently , it 's been heading in the opposite direction			1
birth rate @entity28 : so , here 's an interesting question : could the recession be connected to a decrease in the @entity31 birth rate ? at least one expert thinks the recession is the reason why			1
he says that when people are unsure of their financial future , they tend to put off having kids because , as some parents will tell you , kids are expensive			0
now , the theory would seem to match up against this : in 2007 , when the economy started to get weaker , there were 14.3 babies born for every 1,000 people			0
in 2008 , the birth rate dropped to 13.9			1
last year , it went down to 13.5			0
