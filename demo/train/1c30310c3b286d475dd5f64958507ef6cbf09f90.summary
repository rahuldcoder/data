-- @entity2 has confirmed to @entity4 diplomats that it is holding an @entity6 citizen , the @entity1 said friday			1
the @entity1 has declined to confirm the identity of the citizen , citing privacy issues			1
but the family of 85 - year - old @entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12 , has said he has been detained in @entity2 since october 26			1
@entity13 does not have diplomatic relations with @entity15 , and it has been working through @entity4 -- the @entity6 protecting power in @entity2 -- to obtain information about the @entity6			1
" we are working in close coordination with representatives of the @entity23 to resolve this issue , and they also have requested on a daily basis consular access , " @entity1 spokeswoman @entity18 told reporters			0
the revelation came the same day that @entity10 's wife , @entity28 , pleaded for his release			1
" the family feels there has been some dreadful misunderstanding leading to his detention and asks that ( @entity2 ) work to settle this issue quickly and to return this 85 - year - old grandfather to his anxious , concerned family , " she said in a statement			1
@entity10 , a @entity39 veteran and retired financial consultant , was last seen aboard a flight from @entity15 to @entity42			0
just minutes before the plane was to depart , he was removed from the flight by @entity2 authorities , the family has said			2
" he has been detained somewhere in @entity2 since that time , " @entity10 's wife said in the statement			1
according to the family , @entity10 and a traveling companion , @entity48 , had been on a 10 - day organized private tour of @entity2			1
the family has said @entity10 suffers from a heart condition and only had enough medication for the trip			2
" we have had no word on the state of his health , whether or not the medications sent to him through the @entity23 in @entity2 have been delivered or why he was detained , " the statement said			2
the day before @entity10 was to leave @entity2 , he and his tour guide met with " one or two @entity2 authorities , " his son said			1
during that meeting , @entity10 's service record was discussed , @entity66 said			2
" i understand my dad was a bit bothered , " @entity10 told @entity0			0
but neither he nor his traveling companion believed there was an issue			0
the @entity6 this week issued a warning to @entity6 citizens against all travel to @entity2 , which has become a magnet for adventure travelers after @entity15 lifted some of its travel restrictions			2
@entity10 was a customer of @entity82 of @entity83 , company spokesman @entity81 said in a written statement			0
" the tour arrangements were handled by the @entity86 , " @entity81 said			0
" mr. @entity10 had in place all necessary and valid travel documents to take his tour			0
we have no information concerning what has occurred to result in the current situation			0
" the 10 - day private tour , which included the use of a tour guide , was the culmination of months of planning , @entity10 's wife said			1
" the postcards sent to friends while on that trip describe good times , good weather and knowledgeable guides , " she said in the statement			1
the family 's statement came a day after @entity6 secretary of state @entity109 called on @entity2 to release @entity6 being held , calling the detentions " very , very disturbing choices by the @entity2			1
" @entity10 is one of two @entity6 citizens being held in @entity2			1
the other one , @entity113 , was arrested in november 2012 and sentenced in may to 15 years of hard labor			0
the @entity2 government has said he was found guilty of " hostile acts " and attempts to topple the government			0
@entity2 has not publicly said why it is holding @entity10			2
is @entity6 man detained in @entity2 a bargaining chip ? among the possibilities is his military service			1
he served as an @entity125 infantry officer during the @entity39 , which saw @entity2 fight @entity126 , the @entity6 and the @entity127 between 1950 and 1953			2
an armistice signed in 1953 ended the three - year war between @entity2 and @entity126			0
the two sides technically remain at war			0
it is also possible @entity2 authorities mistook him for another @entity10 , a @entity39 veteran awarded the @entity136 for valor in combat			2
@entity2 authorities are known to routinely run background checks on foreigners , travel agencies warn potential visitors			0
the first the decorated combat veteran heard about @entity10 's detention was in a telephone call from the @entity147 , which first reported the news of the @entity6 's detention			1
" i thought it was a coincidence			0
i did n't think much about it , " @entity10 of @entity151 , @entity152 , told @entity0			0
of his service during the war , he only said : " i went there , did what i was told and went home , went to college and started a family			0
... that 's what you did in those days			0
" how you travel to @entity2 news of the apparent detention came as talks were under way between the @entity6 and @entity167 , @entity2 's closest ally , about reviving negotiations to dismantle @entity15 's nuclear program			1
the timing raises questions about whether @entity2 plans to use @entity10 as a bargaining chip in the negotiations , a move the @entity176 has previously accused it of doing to try to gain concessions with negotiations			2
@entity10 's detentions bring to at least seven the number of @entity6 citizens who have been detained by @entity2 , including four who allegedly entered the country illegally , according to the @entity1			1
two other @entity6 citizens who entered the country on valid visas were arrested for other reasons , and @entity6 officials have received reports of other @entity6 being arbitrarily detained , according to the @entity1			1
previous americans detained in @entity2 have been released when high - profile visitors have traveled to the country to plead their case			2
most notably , former presidents @entity194 and @entity195 went on two separate occasions in 2010			0
former @entity198 gov. @entity197 , a former ambassador to the @entity127 , has visited @entity2 a number of times over the years , most recently this year to discuss the release of @entity113			0
@entity197 's spokeswoman , @entity202 , said he has been " in touch with his @entity2 contacts " regarding @entity10 's detention			1
the photos @entity2 does n't want you to see @entity0 's @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report .			0

detained man 's wife : " the family feels there has been dreadful misunderstanding "

@entity1 has declined to identify the @entity6 , citing privacy issues
but family of @entity10 , 85 , says he 's been held by @entity2 since october
