-- it has the world 's tallest unoccupied building , it puts on the world 's biggest annual show and it 's sometimes prone to petulant nuclear threats			1
but what else do you know about @entity9 ? 1			1
@entity9 brew great beer @entity9 love a pint and have a thriving beer brewing culture			1
@entity13 is one of the best - known local beers			2
in 2000 the state - run brewery bought up an entire @entity18 brewery , shipped it to @entity9 and two years later opened for business just outside @entity20			1
@entity13 is a full - bodied lager and is named after the capital 's @entity22			2
high heels are in women love their high heels and many wear four - inch heels day and night , to work , to do the shopping , in the military -- we even spotted a woman working on a construction site in a pair			1
the wedge heel made its appearance in the isolated state four or five years ago -- a trend that made its way across the border from @entity41			2
today there are still plenty of wedge heels about , but it 's the thin heel that is @entity20 's must - have fashion accessory today			1
you can bring your mobile visitors no longer need to leave their mobiles behind			2
as of january , you can bring your phone into the country and buy a local sim card from a booth at the airport			2
the sim card allows you to make and receive international calls and call other foreigners in @entity20 who have mobiles -- you ca n't call locals as they are on a different network			2
a local sim card for two weeks goes for â ‚ ¬ 50 ( $ 66 ) , but be warned -- calls are expensive ( $ 6.60 a minute to call the @entity63 )			2
@entity9 's @entity64 has more than 2 million subscribers			1
the local cell phones allow all the functions of a regular mobile -- make calls , listen to music , take photos -- with the exception of access to the @entity74			2
given the regular power outages , the " light " function on mobiles gets plenty of use			2
people love to sing most @entity9 can carry a tune and if you ask someone -- politely -- to sing a song they will probably oblige -- on the spot , with no accompaniment			1
pop music is big , especially songs with lyrics			2
the best - known @entity92 group is still the @entity93 -- " @entity94 " and " @entity95 " are high on the list -- and @entity97 and the @entity98 also go down well			2
no surprise then that most bars have karaoke			0
the all - girl band @entity103 is the most popular local group			0
the girls -- who were apparently hand - picked by @entity9 leader @entity105 -- wear skimpy dresses and belt out pop tunes , the @entity9 's answer to k - pop. 5			1
car park volleyball volleyball is one of the most popular sports and @entity9 often strike up a game in their lunch hour			1
the games can be fast and fun , men and women often playing together			0
the lack of a net is no obstacle and many games start up casually in a car park or any open space			0
@entity9 wrestling is also very popular			1
behind the veil : rare look at life in @entity9 6			1
the @entity130 is seriously deep the @entity130 is 100 meters underground and it takes a couple of minutes to ride the escalator down to the station			0
the journey is long enough that some commuters sit on the steps -- despite the signs asking passengers not to			0
there are no advertisements on the walls to distract you on the ride down to the station -- just bare white walls			0
( there are only five advertising billboards in @entity20 , all owned by the same car dealership )			0
the underground network has two lines and 17 stations			0
inspired by the grand @entity155 , many of the stations have ornate chandeliers and paintings and murals on the walls			0
crazy about kimchi kimchi -- spicy pickled vegetables -- is the national dish and it 's said that every woman makes a different kind of kimchi			1
the dish is time - consuming to make and the traditional recipe requires women to lovingly swirl and smear hot pepper paste over cabbage leaves for hours			0
@entity173 of @entity174 , which specializes in travel to the reclusive socialist state , says : " there 's a saying that you must taste a woman 's kimchi before you marry her			1
single - hearted unity @entity9 seem to have an innate ability to form a line -- not a queue , but dead straight lines			1
the training begins as young children and by the time they are in their teens a crowd of hundreds can organize themselves into any number of parallel lines , equally spaced , in a minute			0
whether it 's factory workers walking down the street , people gathering to lay flowers beneath a statue of the @entity200 , or soldiers jogging , moving in formation , showing " single - hearted unity " is the order of the day			0
spend a week touring the capital and your guides will make sure you get give plenty of practice forming lines			0
you won ( ' t ) see that the local currency is the won , but foreigners are not allowed to use it			1
instead visitors must use hard currency -- @entity63 dollars , euros and renminbi			1
bizarrely , given the proximity to @entity41 , the @entity220 offers the worst exchange rate			0
euros get the best rate at present			0
@entity20 is n't a shopping destination			0
@entity9 do most of their shopping in the local markets -- there is a blue - roofed market in most neighborhoods , but foreigners are n't allowed to visit these			1
officially , visitors are n't allowed in department stores either , but this is a rule that is given much more flexibility			0
visitors tend to be herded into the @entity237 and stamp and souvenir shops where you can stock up on propaganda posters , @entity9 stamps and postcards and books by @entity244 ( he wrote -- or ghostwrote -- hundreds )			1
@entity105 pins all @entity9 wear a " @entity105 pin " on the left breast of whatever they are wearing			1
the pins show a portrait of @entity200 or his son , @entity244 -- and sometimes both			0
surprisingly given that everyone wears one -- from infants to old folks -- there are no shops selling the pins			0
instead they are given out sporadically -- on special occasions and to mark significant events -- and there are lots of different styles			0
the style does n't denote anything , just the period it was given out			0
there is a story that @entity9 will be punished if they give a @entity105 pin to a foreigner , but that 's a myth and they are occasionally given to visitors			1
