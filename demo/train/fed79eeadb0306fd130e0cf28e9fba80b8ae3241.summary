@entity0 , @entity1 -- i first heard of @entity4 in 1997 when the charity requested a visit to @entity7 for a dream recipient			1
after the visit , i received a thank - you note and photo of the dreamer in front of the @entity7 gates			2
i was moved by her experience and decided i wanted to get more involved , so i picked up the phone to find out more about the foundation			0
i was absolutely mesmerized and instantly attached to their unique mission of granting wishes to adults with terminal illnesses			1
when i was asked to be an ambassador and spokeswoman for the charity , i could n't say yes fast enough			1
how could i turn down such a great cause ? i 've been honored to travel and represent the organization across the country at special events and corporate meetings , as well as in public service announcements , television and print interviews			0
but the best part of my " job " is seeing the hands - on attention and care we give to the people we serve			1
there 's a common misperception that all the dreams we fulfill are for grand vacations			2
but many requests are profoundly basic : pay a utility bill , or provide mobility with a scooter			0
no matter the scale of the dream -- whether it 's a peaceful escape to the beach , a long - delayed family reunion or an appliance that works -- every one is touching and heartwarming because it unites people			1
dreams provide comfort and closure , not only to the recipients , but to their family members as well			1
ill parents often want nothing more than to see their kids smiling and having fun again			2
in turn , these dreams also give children an opportunity to see their parents happy , carefree and outside of the hospital 's sterile environment			2
one dreamer really stands out in my mind : @entity76 , a young girl of 23 with cancer			0
she had a beautiful voice and wanted to be a singer			0
the @entity4 contacted @entity82 - winning songwriter @entity81 and got permission for @entity76 to record a song in @entity81 's studio			1
when @entity76 played the recording back , it was heartwarming to see her smile and be so full of joy			0
the song not only made @entity76 happy , but her family happy as well , knowing her dream had been fulfilled			2
how can you beat that ? after @entity76 passed , her husband was left with that precious recording to help remember her by			0
to this day , he still calls and thanks the @entity4 for granting his wife 's wish			1
i 've been blessed to work with @entity4			1
the organization has impacted me in so many ways			0
i think when you see and experience someone 's dream with them , it lives on within you			0
it 's life - changing			0
we all have problems , but we have to stop thinking of ourselves and focus on the bigger picture			0
there are people suffering all over the world , and we can make life a little bit better -- even if only for a moment -- one dream at a time .			1
