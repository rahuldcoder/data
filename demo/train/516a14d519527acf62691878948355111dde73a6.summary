-- you can not mess with @entity3			1
the moment the @entity5 came under attack , the country pulled together and rallied			1
the @entity7 vowed to pursue the bombers " to the ends of the earth			0
" they meant it , and everyone knew it			0
if you launch a terrorist attack on @entity3 soil , @entity3 's vast resources will spring into action and the country will spare no effort to catch you			1
within three days of the marathon blasts investigators had identified the suspects and released their pictures to the public			0
by the end of the week , one of the suspects was dead , the other in custody			0
@entity31 poured into the streets in joyous celebration			0
but how strong , really , is @entity3 ? @entity3 are dying by the thousands at the hands of other @entity3 and the country ca n't figure out what to do about it			1
many at home and abroad scratched their heads when in the midst of the bombing investigation , with all hands on deck to crack the case , the @entity39 could not manage to approve a minuscule improvement to the country 's efforts to keep weapons out of the hands of potential criminals , including possible terrorists even though polls show most of the public support it			1
how strong , really , is @entity3 ? no other nation has even a small portion of @entity3 's military power or a fraction of its reach			1
the country 's enemies know they have nowhere to hide			2
@entity3 's unmanned drones will find you and kill you in the most remote corners of the earth			1
@entity3 are patriotic and resilient			1
the population responded with determination , kindness and courage after the @entity73 bombing			0
police , military and intelligence personnel are skilled and brave			0
they have kept terrorist attacks to a minimum in the years since 9/11			0
and when terrorists attack , or try to , investigators solve the case with a quickness and ingenuity that rivals fictional television detectives , even as we 're constantly warned it is unrealistic to expect such dramatic results			2
@entity3 's might is something to behold			1
except when it is n't			0
more than 30,000 people in the @entity3 are killed every year by someone brandishing a gun			1
it is a staggering number , no matter what you believe about the right to bear arms			0
a problem that causes so many people to die every year is one that requires urgent attention			0
and yet @entity3 simply can not find a way to stop it			1
how strong is that ? it is as if a house stood protected as a fortress , with a high fence around it , with guard towers and alarm systems to keep intruders out , while inside the residents were slaughtering one another			2
when you travel abroad , people ask what it is about @entity3 and their guns			1
as much as we hear from hunters , the issue goes much deeper than that			0
from the founding days of the nation , freedom lay at its core , and freedom has been viewed as protection from an overreaching government			0
the @entity131 to the @entity132 , adopted in 1791 , states that the people have a right to " bear arms , " but it also prefaces it with what sounds like a caveat , that this is because " a well regulated militia " is " necessary to the security of a free state			0
" still , @entity3 have had a romantic relationship with their arms			1
think back to the cowboys and their six - shooters and @entity147 rifles			0
the romance and the freedom , it 's all part of @entity3 's character and history			1
@entity3 will never look at guns the way , say , the @entity153 look at them			1
in some respects , that is part of @entity3 's strength			1
the people feel a very personal stake , a direct responsibility for the country 's freedom			2
and yet , not even the most ardent gun lovers would argue that it is acceptable for young men filled with hatred , dangerously disturbed or with a track record of violence , to have free access to weapons			2
the greatest defenders of freedom agree that the massacre of children in school or of moviegoers in a theater constitute a grave affront to the security of the country			2
it has become a crisis that demands a response			0
if @entity3 were really strong , it would find a way to stop the killings , to staunch the bleeding			1
but no , @entity3 has become weak			2
the nation has become incapable of solving problems through normal legislative channels			2
how strong is that ? the country 's political system has fallen into a muddy , sticky , foul - smelling quagmire			1
problems whose gravity is enough to produce near consensus among the population can not seem to find a solution in @entity203			2
if it 's a pure security issue , authorities can order everyone to stay at home in @entity73 for an entire day			0
they can ask everyone to send in their @entity211 pictures of the marathon to try to solve the case together			2
if the problem is national debt , however , the mighty nation produces a travesty like the " sequester , " creating hundreds of flight delays for no reason at all other than the incompetence of its politicians			0
or if the problem is regulatory oversight , how strong is a country where parts of a town are destroyed by the explosion of a fertilizer plant that had not had an inspection in more than two decades ? @entity3 is in possession of more power than any country on @entity235			1
and yet , its people are not secure			0
they are dying in large numbers from problems that a better functioning government could do much to prevent			0
to make @entity3 truly strong and its people safe , fixing this broken system deserves at least as much urgent attention as catching the perpetrators of terrorist attacks			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			0

@entity248 : @entity5 *aftermath* shows vast resources , reach of @entity3
@entity253 : yet , the country can not pass a *measure* that can keep guns out of potential criminals
she says @entity3 can not seem to solve its bigger problems through its political process
@entity253 : if @entity3 were strong , it would find ways to stop the gun violence and fix its debt
