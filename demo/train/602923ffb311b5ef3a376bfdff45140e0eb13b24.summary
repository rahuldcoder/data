-- @entity2 president @entity1 and his vice-president , @entity3 , wo n't be there			2
as a matter of fact , neither will the heads of state from @entity6 or @entity7			0
but the good news for @entity12 president @entity11 is that @entity14 president @entity13 will be at the @entity15			1
so far only @entity17 's president , @entity16 — -- an outspoken critic of the @entity12 government -- has openly said that she is boycotting the games for political reasons			1
the @entity21 have been bedeviled by allegations of corruption leading to cost overruns and @entity12 's attitude towards homosexuality however @entity13 , who heads world football 's governing body and is a member of the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , believes threats to skip the @entity32 over @entity12 's anti-gay laws would be counterproductive			1
gay rights activists have been protesting against the law which was passed in june 2013 which prohibits talking about homosexuality in front of children			0
the law has been widely criticized by @entity41 leaders who have called it archaic and discriminatory , leading to politicians from around the world deciding to snub the @entity32			0
but @entity13 , whose own organization is facing criticism for holding the @entity47 in @entity48 amid protests and domestic unrest says the opportunity for dialogue outweighs a boycott			1
" these two events ( @entity57 and the @entity47 in @entity48 ) have one thing in common : they have both been misused as a platform for political disputes , " he said in his column in @entity14 's weekly magazine			1
" in the case of the @entity21 , this dispute is coming to a head with threats to boycott the @entity32			2
" such a boycott would change nothing			0
on the contrary , it may be interpreted as a refusal to establish a dialogue on the issue , as was the case with boycotts of the @entity32 in @entity74 in 1980 or in @entity75 in 1984			0
" i believe that such a major event presents a perfect opportunity to strike up conversations and cultivate contacts			0
" @entity12 president @entity11 has already stated that no athlete would face discrimination at february 's games while protestors will have designated zones in @entity57 to make their protests			1
@entity13 , the man who infamously said that racism on the pitch could be settled by a handshake , believes that by traveling to @entity57 , it will allow issues such as homosexuality to be discussed in front of a larger audience			2
" it is also likely that unpleasant issues will be addressed , because @entity14 's fight against discrimination does not end with the anti-racism campaign , " he added			1
" we must fight every form of social exclusion			0
anyone who decides to boycott the @entity21 in @entity57 will be surrendering on this important issue , just as anyone running away from a problem will never be able to resolve it			0
" this reason alone is why it is important for me to travel to @entity12			2

@entity14 president @entity13 warns against boycott
@entity113 says boycott would be a form of " surrender "
@entity13 says @entity120 " misused as platform for political disputes "
protestors have *voiced* *opposition* to @entity12 's anti-gay laws
