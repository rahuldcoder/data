-- @entity1 , 15 , received a heart transplant tuesday night at @entity3 of @entity4 , according to a family spokesman			1
@entity1 is recovering and " doing great , " @entity6 said			2
@entity1 's case first attracted national attention when his family told media the hospital had denied him a spot on the heart transplant list			1
an august 7 letter from the hospital , which @entity6 provided to @entity0 , said that " @entity1 is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance , which is one of our center 's contraindications to listing for heart transplant			1
" noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to follow - up appointments			2
a week later , according to @entity6 , doctors reversed that decision and gave @entity1 top priority on the transplant list			1
on august 16 , @entity1 had a procedure to insert a device to support his failing heart , @entity6 said			1
the ventricular assist device , or @entity36 , was used to help the heart function and blood flow while he waited for the heart transplant			1
the mechanical pump included a small tube that carried blood out of the heart into a pump , and another tube that carried blood from the pump to blood vessels			0
vessels deliver blood to the body			0
@entity6 said @entity1 's heart transplant started at 6:15 p.m. on tuesday and lasted just over five hours			1
the teen has been in the hospital since july 14 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity55			2
children 's healthcare of @entity4 has been mum on @entity1 's case , citing patient privacy			2
last week a hospital spokeswoman declined to confirm @entity1 's @entity36 procedure and referred @entity0 to the family for related inquiries			1
the hospital is in good standing , according to the @entity66 , the nonprofit organization in charge of transplant coordination in the @entity69			2
" @entity3 of @entity4 has performed 10 transplants so far this year ; three of them in the past week alone , " the hospital said in a statement wednesday			1
" since our transplant program 's inception , we have performed 279 pediatric heart transplants on children ages ranging from newborn to 21			2
" a matter of compliance assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient does n't strictly take all required medicines as directed , he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital , said dr. @entity88 , a cardiothoracic surgeon at the @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity91 , who is not involved with this case			1
but @entity6 said a doctor told the family that @entity1 's low grades and time spent in juvenile detention factored into that assessment			1
" the doctor made the decision that he was n't a good candidate because of that , " @entity6 said			0
" i guess he did n't think @entity1 was going to be a productive citizen			1
" @entity1 's mother , @entity105 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity106 that doctors said @entity1 would have lived only three to six months if he had n't gotten the heart transplant			1
the @entity111 's @entity110 chapter was involved in drawing media attention to @entity1 's case because the organization has " a longtime relationship with the child , " said the rev. @entity117 , the chapter 's president , @entity117 said @entity1 was judged based on " tattoos and an ankle bracelet " from a " juvenile agency			1
" @entity6 said the detention was because @entity1 got into " an altercation to protect his younger brother			0
" @entity1 had no health problems before this summer , @entity6 said ; the heart problem is not congenital			2
but he started to have trouble sleeping and then complained about his chest hurting			0
his mother took him to the hospital because of the chest pains			0
@entity6 said the family did n't press the doctor on what led to overturning the decision regarding the transplant list			1
personally , @entity6 attributes it to " the handiwork of @entity139 and the media pressure			0
" the hospital did not comment on what led to doctors ' change of heart			0
the complexity of transplants federal records show that 3,400 people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in 2012 , but only 2,000 of these procedures were performed			0
while waiting for a heart transplant , 331 people died			1
dr. @entity154 , medical director of @entity156 's @entity155 and @entity157 , said it 's not unusual for patients to be rejected from organ transplant lists because of noncompliance -- in other words , if they are seen as people who wo n't follow instructions about taking medications and seeing doctors			2
at @entity156 , @entity154 's group evaluates about 300 patients per year for lung transplants and turns down about 1 % to 2 % because of noncompliance			0
it 's about the same for heart transplants , as well , he said			0
as part of the evaluation process , organ transplant patients undergo a complete psychosocial evaluation so doctors can get a sense of whether they and their families will follow through with a complicated medical regimen , @entity154 said			0
" a few times a year , we run into people who ca n't , " he said			0
a patient would not be turned down solely for having served prison time or having bad grades , @entity154 said , but " we would want to look at the entire picture			0
" some patients have been denied because they do n't have anyone in their lives who can take care of them and accompany them to appointments			0
after a heart transplant , patients are too sick to do these things alone , @entity154 said			1
" when we fear that someone 's not going to do well , it 's because the patient could n't comply with the regimen or they do n't have any support in their life , " he said			0
psychosocial factors do n't change a person 's priority on the waiting list , but they could lead a person to be denied a spot on that list , he said			2
@entity210 , head of the division of medical ethics at @entity213 , noted that patients have to adhere to a lifelong regimen after receiving an organ transplant -- showing up at medical appointments , taking medications , monitoring changes in health -- and teenagers in general do n't have a good track record of following orders			0
teenagers are n't automatically ruled out for heart transplants , but " the consequence that ' you are going to die if you do n't take these medicines ' is far from the mind of a 17 - year - old , " said @entity88 , the cardiothoracic surgeon			1
@entity210 said @entity1 should be counseled and worked with intensively so he understands what 's expected post-transplant .			0
