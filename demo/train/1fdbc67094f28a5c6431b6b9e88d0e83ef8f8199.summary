-- as a swimmer , his countless hours of training paid off handsomely -- earning him a record 18 olympic gold medals			1
as a golfer , @entity5 is wondering what he 's got himself into			1
" it 's one of the most humbling games i 've tried to do in my entire life , " the @entity8 tells @entity0			2
" i could always pick things up fairly easily , but i do n't get how hitting a little object -- a little white ball , that is n't moving -- is so hard			0
" why ca n't i just hit this in a straight line ? or hook it , or draw it , or fade it -- i ca n't do it			0
i 'm finally learning how to be able to do all that stuff and do it consistently			0
but i still do have some pretty bad shots			0
" have a quick look online and you 'll find @entity26 hurling his driver away in disgust after embarrassingly topping his tee shot at the home of golf , @entity33 in @entity34			1
" throwing clubs , using profanity -- everything comes out , " @entity26 says			2
but there are some moments of magic , such as when -- as a 26 handicapper -- he sank a monster 150 - foot putt at the @entity46 pro-am in @entity34 last october			0
however , golf requires both power and precision -- which @entity26 , who was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder as a child , is slowly learning to combine			1
" he 's one of those players that people would look at and say , ' he has a lot of potential			0
' what that technically means is that the player is very long and very wild , " says @entity59 ' former coach @entity58 , who has been tutoring @entity26 in the latest series of his television show @entity61			1
" they never look at someone who hits it a very short distance and say , ' oh you 've got a lot of potential			0
' they always comment on the potential someone has as based solely on the distance of their hitting			0
" @entity58 has some history in shaping unpredictable talents , having previously worked with former basketballer @entity79 and boxer @entity80 among his celebrity tv clients			1
" @entity5 is 6 ' 4 but he has a 6 ' 8 wingspan , so his arms are very long			1
because of that he has a pretty long , loose swing , " @entity58 tells @entity0			2
" it 's capable of generating a lot of power ... that 's been the biggest challenge , to get his swing better so he can control it a bit			0
" @entity58 says @entity26 is " definitely getting better " after carding true hackers ' scores of between 97 and 117 in six rounds immediately after the @entity97 -- where he took his career tally to a record 22 medals			1
" his no. 1 goal after the @entity102 was to learn how to play golf and be decent at it , " @entity58 says			1
" i think he 's passionate about it			0
it 's nice to have someone like @entity5 interested in the game , it 's great for golf			1
" " @entity112 " golf is not only giving the 27 - year - old @entity26 a new hobby ( if not quite a new career ) -- it is also extending his commercial sell - by date			1
while he 's not in the $ 250 million league that @entity120 reportedly paid to sign up golf 's new star @entity121 , the " @entity112 " has already landed a club deal with @entity124			2
" @entity124 is a well - established global brand that should be able to deliver @entity26 with huge international exposure , " says @entity126 sports business expert @entity125			1
" @entity26 , meanwhile , provides @entity124 with a brand association that has a strong track - record of success at the very highest level			1
" that said , this is a somewhat strange alliance that would be appear to be fraught with difficulty			0
it does n't make instant sense , and quite what the tangible returns will be to both parties is n't necessarily obvious			0
" if there is no expectation that @entity26 will become a professional golfer , the @entity124 deal tends rather to imply that this is short - term opportunism -- unless , of course , the relaunch and rebranding of @entity26 as a global sport or leisure brand starts here			1
" if the @entity26 brand in golf is to have any sustainable future , he needs to start delivering the kind of performances that fans and consumers will be looking for			2
" @entity159 12 year - old to make history @entity58 doubts that @entity26 will be able to make it as a pro golfer , citing the very few examples of sports stars who 've been able to switch to the game -- and most of those have been on the seniors circuit			1
" the possibility is there , but golf seems to take more time than any other sport -- there 's so much to learn and so much to practice			2
you have to dedicate full - time to golf to get there , " @entity58 says			1
" it 's a big difference between being a scratch golfer or two handicap and being a professional golfer			2
it 's a whole other world , " @entity58 adds when asked about the golfing prospects of retired tennis star @entity184 , who like @entity26 has been hitting the celebrity pro-am circuit			1
new adventure and @entity26 sounds like he 's enjoying his retirement too much to dedicate himself to the same punishing routine that saw him not miss a 6.30 a.m training session for six years -- as @entity58 was informed by his protege 's former swim coach			1
" i 've been saying a lot more recently about how great it is to be retired , " says @entity26			2
" i can wake up at 10 in the morning , grab a cup of coffee , read the newspaper			0
" if i feel like hitting a couple of golf balls , i hit some golf balls			0
i really just hang out , and it 's awesome			0
" at this point i 'm really just trying to enjoy the sport , learn the sport , and be able to beat all of my friends who i go out and play with			0
" however , @entity58 is in no doubt that @entity26 is committed to his new adventure			1
" the crossover is the work ethic that he has -- he knows what it takes to be great in sports , " the 57 - year - old coach says			1
" he 's used to being coached , that makes it easier for me			0
in golf you have to be coached , no - one just knows how to do it			2
in order for that to happen , you like to have someone that 's used to taking coaching			0
" for someone who has coached 14 - time major winner @entity225 , the goals of a novice like @entity26 ( " he 's thinking pro-ams and playing amateur golf			1
he 'd love to win a club championship one day " ) bring @entity58 back full circle in his career			2
" @entity59 was my last student and i had determined that when i started with @entity59 , i said he 's going to be the last touring pro that i have , " says @entity58 , who wrote a book detailing his six years working with the biggest name in modern golf			1
" i taught touring pros for 32 years and i enjoyed it			0
it was incredible , a lot of great experiences , but 32 years was enough for me -- i taught over 200 touring pros			0
it was time for me to do something different			0
and where do you go from @entity59 ? " @entity250 tips apart from his tv show , @entity58 is now focused on his corporate work , his @entity253 based at @entity254 , @entity255 -- and taking the game to the people			1
" @entity266 's been awful good to me , i have no problems doing that , i 'm very thankful to the game of golf , " says @entity58 , who is an active presence on @entity250 , giving away tips to anyone who contacts him -- much to the chagrin of some of his peers			1
" last year i did clinics for over 15,000 people , so i feel like through @entity250 and doing the clinics i 'm much more able to reach a larger audience and giving back to the game a little bit			2
" i enjoy being a top instructor who is willing and able to do those things			0
" he says his junior academy , which has almost 150 students from 22 countries , is not necessarily seeking to unearth the next @entity59			2
" i 'm really proud of the fact that the kids do n't just learn golf but they have a great education			0
every kid from our academy last year went to college , 94 % of them got scholarships			0
i really enjoy seeing how much they grow as people from being in our academy			0
