@entity0 , @entity1 -- speculation about vice presidential picks is heating up			1
as it has become increasingly clear that @entity7 will win the @entity9 nomination , there has been all kinds of chatter about who he will pick to run with him on the ticket			1
there has even been some talk about whether president @entity16 would consider replacing vice president @entity17 with another running mate if @entity19 felt their campaign needed more juice			2
@entity23 's film version of the book " @entity25 " offers a powerful reminder of the perils that come from making a bad choice			0
the conventional wisdom stipulates that vice presidential selections will rarely help a candidate win an election , but the wrong choice can be devastating			1
with @entity35 in 2008 this was certainly true			0
although there were many factors that led to @entity16 's victory , picking @entity39 severely weakened his campaign			0
vice presidential picks are not an opportunity to make a game change , at least in a positive direction			1
when @entity35 turned to @entity39 , he did so in an effort to overcome many of his perceived weaknesses against candidate @entity16 -- his inability to attract the base of his party , fears that he would appear to look like the " older " candidate in the race , as well as the concern that he was a less charismatic candidate in the eyes of the media			1
clearly the @entity39 pick backfired			0
what can @entity7 and others learn from this episode ? the first lesson is that vice presidential picks should be boring			1
in the end , @entity7 must overcome his weaknesses as a candidate by what he does on the campaign trail , not by who he picks as his running mate			1
having the right person stand beside you rarely will change the way the public sees you			0
but calling on the wrong person can draw all the focus away from the campaign 's main themes and raise serious concerns about the competence of the candidate			2
very often , less than exciting candidates -- @entity84 in 2000 , sen. @entity82 in 1992 or @entity83 in 1980 -- turned out to be perfect primarily because they did n't cause much of a stir			2
when it comes to vice presidential candidates , less attention is better			1
a second lesson is that candidates must make sure that their running mate can handle the national spotlight in the modern media age			1
it 's far different to be a rock star in @entity97 than it is in @entity99			0
with all the outlets for news today , with cable television , the @entity104 and social media constantly finding and supplying information , it is very difficult to contain charges or gaffes before they go viral			0
and despite all the criticism that our current politics are shallow , the fact is that competence can matter very much when candidates stand before the media			1
when @entity39 stumbled in her interviews on national television about basic foreign policy questions , the media immediately exposed her flaws			1
@entity123 's questions did huge damage to @entity39 in 2008 in a manner that most democrats could only have dreamed of doing			0
a third lesson is that appealing to the party 's base during the general election is not always the best move to make			1
after all , @entity7 's chief asset remains the fact that he is the moderate @entity9 in the campaign , the @entity9 who has the best chance to win over independents and disaffected moderate @entity19 in november			1
it is difficult for a candidate to pick someone as a running mate who is far to the right but still maintains credibility with centrist voters			0
the vice presidential nominee can quickly drag the main candidate to the right , as @entity35 learned			1
when @entity39 made an increasingly strident appeal to the right , lambasting @entity16 as a radical leftist and even someone who was un-american , the tone of the entire @entity35 campaign changed			0
the most dramatic moment came when @entity35 literally felt the need to take the microphone back at a rally and correct a woman who said that @entity16 was " an @entity159			0
" but by then it was too late			0
many loyal @entity9 privately admitted that they could n't vote for their candidate with @entity39 on the ticket			0
one of @entity35 's biggest potential virtues -- his appeal to moderates -- was gone			0
the best way for @entity7 to win over the base will be to run a strong campaign as the candidate he is			1
in the recent primaries in @entity172 , @entity170 reported that @entity7 was finally gaining traction with @entity174 @entity9 without achieving any huge transformation of his image			2
the final lesson is less negative			0
@entity35 was correct when he decided , like @entity83 before him , that choosing a vice president from a particular region was no longer decisive			0
long gone are the days when @entity180 , from @entity181 , picked @entity182 of @entity183 as a running mate to win southern votes			0
now candidates think nationally , focusing on how a vice presidential choice will complement their national campaign and strengthen positive perceptions that voters have			1
while in @entity39 's case the choice did not work out , this is the way that @entity7 must think about his selection , just as @entity16 did when he picked @entity17 from the small state of @entity196			2
overall , @entity7 needs to pick someone who voters feel could handle the presidency in an emergency and , perhaps even more importantly , someone who wo n't derail the campaign strategy			2
otherwise , like @entity35 , @entity7 might end up making the wrong kind of game changing decision			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity208 says candidates sometimes seek a **vp** to make up for their weaknesses
he says vice presidential nominees should not become the focus of media attention
**vp** choices must be up to the task of dealing with reporter questions , he says
@entity208 : if @entity7 picks someone to appease party base , he could alienate moderates
