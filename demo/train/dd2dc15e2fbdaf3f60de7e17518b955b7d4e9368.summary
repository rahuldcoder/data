christian pastor @entity2 will be put to death for several charges of rape and extortion , charges that differ greatly from his original sentence of apostasy , @entity1 's semi-official @entity0 reported friday			1
@entity9 , the deputy governor of @entity10 , where @entity2 was tried and convicted , accused @entity12 media of twisting the real story , referring to him as a " rapist			1
" a previous report from the news agency claimed he had committed several violent crimes , including repeated rape and extortion			1
" his crime is not , as some claim , converting others to @entity24 , " @entity9 told @entity0			0
" he is guilty of security - related crimes			1
" in a translated @entity1 @entity30 brief from 2010 , however , the charge of apostasy is the only charge leveled against @entity2			1
" mr. @entity2 , son of @entity31 , 32 - years old , married , born in @entity32 in the state of @entity10 is convicted of turning his back on @entity35 , the greatest religion the prophesy of @entity37 at the age of 19 , " reads the brief			1
the brief was obtained by @entity39 from the @entity40 and was translated from its original @entity41 by the @entity42 in @entity43			0
it goes on to say that during the court proceeding , @entity2 denied the prophecy of @entity37 and the authority of @entity35			1
" he ( @entity2 ) has stated that he is a @entity24 and no longer @entity48 , " states the brief			1
" during many sessions in court with the presence of his attorney and a judge , he has been sentenced to execution by hanging according to article 8 of @entity57 -- olvasileh			0
" @entity9 , the official from @entity10 , confirmed that his execution is " not imminent " nor is it final			2
@entity60 , the pastor 's lawyer , said through a translator that even in light of the @entity0 report , he does not believe @entity2 will be put to death			1
" the case is still in progress , " @entity60 said			0
" there 's a 95 % that he wo n't get the death penalty			1
yes , i still believe that			0
" @entity60 spoke briefly of the trial proceedings , stating that he presented documents to the court that should be convincing , including documents from @entity77 leaders that state the crime does not warrant the possible punishment			0
" this is a legal process that should take its course , and it should stand , on its own merits			0
it should succeed , " @entity60 said			0
@entity2 , the leader of a network of house churches in @entity1 , was first convicted of apostasy in november 2010 , a charge he subsequently appealed all the way to the @entity1 @entity30			1
after four days of an appeals trial that started sunday at a lower court in @entity10 , @entity2 refused to recant his beliefs			2
that said , @entity9 -- echoing an earlier report from @entity0 -- insisted that " @entity2 's crime and his death sentence have nothing to do with his beliefs			1
" no one is executed in @entity1 for their choice of religion , " he added			1
" he is a zionist and has committed security - related crimes			1
" the possible execution of @entity2 , based on an assumption it is tied to his @entity24 belief , has elicited responses from the highest levels of the @entity114 government , too			2
secretary of state @entity115 released a statement friday that said the @entity114 stands with " all @entity1 against the @entity1 government 's hypocritical statements and actions			2
" the @entity120 released a statement on thursday , stating that @entity2 " has done nothing more than maintain his devout faith , which is a universal right for people			1
" " that the @entity1 authorities would try to force him to renounce that faith violates the religious values they claim to defend , crosses all bounds of decency and breaches @entity1 's own international obligations , " reads the statement			2
@entity134 , chairman of the @entity135 , says a trial for apostasy in @entity1 is rare			2
according to him , this is the first apostasy trial since 1990			0
@entity2 's trial and his possible execution have engaged @entity114 @entity141 , as well			2
@entity142 , spokesman for @entity143 , a @entity24 organization that attempts to assist with persecuted and minority churches around the world , called the news of the new charges proof that international attention on the issue is working			0
" they are feeling the attention , they are feeling the weight of the eyes of the world watching how they are treating this man , " @entity142 said			0
" i am dumbfounded , though , that at this stage in the game , this is what they would trot out			0
" @entity143 manages a @entity162 page that has brought a lot of attention to @entity2 's trial			2
with comments updated by the minute , thousand of people have taken to @entity162 to spread the word about the pastor			0
in light of this news , @entity142 said the @entity162 page would continue to be active			0
" i think our first response will be prayer for pastor @entity175 , " @entity142 said			0
" prayer that justice will be done and that he will remain faithful no matter that the days ahead may bring for him			0
