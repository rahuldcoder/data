@entity0 -- the family of @entity4 , the @entity5 fan who was severely beaten at @entity6 , filed a civil lawsuit tuesday claiming faulty security measures and defective facilities contributed to his attack , court officials said			1
the lawsuit , filed in @entity13 , names the @entity14 and its owner , @entity15 , as defendants			0
the suit lists @entity4 's parents , @entity19 and @entity20 , as plaintiffs on behalf of his two minor children , @entity23 and @entity24 , according to court spokeswoman @entity25			1
" it is unfortunate that such a storied and well respected baseball club such as the @entity14 has been made to suffer due to the cutbacks and mismanagement by its owner @entity15 and his various corporate entities , " the lawsuit says			2
the complaint alleges that cutbacks led to a major downsizing of security as a cost - saving measure due to @entity15 's personal family problems and to " fund his lavish lifestyle			1
" @entity15 and his wife , @entity41 , are in the middle of a contentious divorce proceeding			0
his divorce attorney , @entity44 , declined to comment on the suit			0
@entity4 , 42 , was attacked in the stadium parking lot following the first game of the @entity14 ' and @entity5 ' seasons on march 31			1
@entity4 , a paramedic by training , had gone to the game with friends in celebration of the @entity5 ' @entity54 victory last season			1
the lawsuit alleges that security officers and managers at @entity6 were apprised of a history of aggressive violent behavior and criminal gang activity in some crowds at the stadium , and neglected to provide reasonable safety mechanisms to protect @entity4 , including the failure to hire a security chief for six weeks prior to opening day			1
a " half - off " alcohol promotion for all day games also was cited in the suit as a contributing factor in the disorderly conduct and violent aggressive behavior			2
according to the suit , prior incidents of violence should have resulted in the hiring and presence of more uniformed police officers instead of security personnel dressed in trousers and polo shirts			2
the suit cites a parking - lot incident at the stadium on september 19 , 2003 , in which a @entity5 fan was shot and killed by a reputed @entity14 fan			1
a then - 20 - year - old @entity89 man was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison in that case , according to the @entity94 district attorney 's website			0
in 2009 , a man was attacked on opening day as the @entity14 hosted the @entity5 , according to the lawsuit			1
" the decision not to place uniformed ( @entity0 police ) officers created a relaxed , intimidating atmosphere at @entity6 , " the suit says			1
before the attack , @entity4 had texted a family member fearing for his safety inside the stadium as fans repeatedly taunted and yelled profanities at him , according to @entity4 's relatives			1
several fans threw hot dogs , peanuts and trash at @entity4 and his companions , the suit alleges			2
" @entity14 personnel walked up and down the aisle directly adjacent to where @entity4 and his friends were seated			2
ushers were present and actively viewed aggressive behavior towards @entity4 , but failed to take any preventative measures , " the suit says			2
the suit claims that @entity4 was subjected to harassment , threats and intimidation even as he left the stadium and entered the parking lot area and that security personnel , knowing those dangers , failed to diffuse the escalation of violent behavior or intervene and ensure his safety in a reasonable manner			1
the suit also claims that security officers allowed @entity4 's alleged attackers to follow him out of the stadium and into the parking lot taxi loading zone where the beating occurred			1
in the lot , two men confronted @entity4 and -- unprovoked -- began kicking and punching him while yelling profanities about the @entity5 , police said			1
the suit also alleges that the security response time was inadequate , in part , because of poor lighting in the lot			2
it took 10 to 15 minutes after the attack for personnel to reach @entity4			2
" @entity6 is the third oldest stadium in baseball			0
without the implementation of adequate security measures by the @entity14 defendants , along with inadequate lighting fixtures that have been in existence since the opening of @entity6 in 1962 , @entity4 was inappropriately exposed to the aggressive acts of third parties , " according to the suit			1
citing club policy , a spokesman for the @entity14 declined to comment on the lawsuit			0
on sunday , @entity0 authorities announced the arrest of a man that police described as the " primary aggressor " in the attack			0
police said @entity172 , 31 , was jailed on $ 1 million bail , and the investigation was continuing			0
police said later that @entity172 is a parolee and documented gang member associated with the @entity177 street gang in @entity178			0
in 1998 , @entity172 was convicted of robbery and possession of a firearm in 2005 , court records show			0
@entity4 's mother , @entity19 , said recently that her son was first hit from behind , at which point he fell and his head hit the concrete			0
" it was just a brutal attack , " she said			0
" whatever that guy hit my son with , @entity4 was unconscious before he hit the ground , so he had no way to protect his head			0
@entity4 was taken out of a medically induced coma over a week ago , and has since shown signs of some cognitive function , @entity0 neurosurgeon dr. @entity194 said			1
he was transferred last week from @entity94 - @entity198 to @entity199 and @entity200 , bringing him closer to his home , @entity194 said			0
authorities are searching for at least two other suspects in the beating			0
the attackers fled in a white four door late model @entity209 or @entity210 vehicle with tan interior , police said .			0
