@entity0 -- on tuesday , more than 42 years after air force chief master sgt. @entity2 died on a @entity4 mountaintop , president @entity5 will award him the @entity6 , the military 's highest award for bravery			1
but for decades even @entity2 's own children did n't know about his heroism			1
@entity12 was in third grade in 1968 , when he was told that his father had died in a helicopter accident in @entity16			2
at age 29 he learned the truth , when the @entity19 declassified his father 's story			1
" i was stunned , " he told @entity1 during a visit to his hometown of @entity24 , @entity25			2
during the @entity28 , @entity27 troops were n't supposed to be in neutral @entity4 , so @entity2 and a handful of colleagues shed their uniforms and posed as civilians to run a top - secret radar installation high on a @entity4 cliff			1
called @entity36 85 , it guided @entity27 bombers to sites in @entity39 and parts of @entity4 under communist control			1
the @entity39 wanted to eliminate the installation , and early on the morning of march 11 , 1968 , its soldiers succeeded in scaling the 3,000 - foot precipice and launching an attack			2
@entity47 , of the @entity46 's @entity46 , wrote the book " one day too long : @entity50 85 and the @entity51			1
" he calls @entity2 " a hero			1
" @entity47 said @entity2 , a technician , picked up an @entity55 rifle , which he barely knew how to use , and ferociously protected his colleagues			1
one of them was @entity58			2
" i got hit in both legs , " @entity58 remembered , " and everybody was screaming and hollering , but they were n't able to get close because of @entity62 at them			0
" @entity64 still has scars from the shrapnel wounds he got that day			0
" he was the only one that did n't get injured in the firefight , " he recalled			0
" they kept throwing grenades and shooting , and we kept picking up hand grenades and throwing them , or kicking them to the other side of the mountain			0
" when a helicopter flown by @entity46 - affiliated @entity77 arrived to evacuate them , @entity2 braved enemy fire to load three wounded comrades , including @entity64 and @entity58 , onto hoists			1
" thank @entity82 for @entity83			0
if it was n't for him , i would not be alive today , " @entity64 told @entity1			0
@entity2 made it onto the chopper unwounded			1
but as it began to pull away , enemy shots rang out			0
@entity58 said he saw a splotch of red , and realized the man who had saved his life had lost his own			2
one round had hit @entity2 and killed him			1
" i live it every day , " said @entity58			0
" i live it every day			0
" shortly after @entity2 's death , he was secretly awarded the @entity98 for bravery			1
he was recommended for the @entity6 , but then - president @entity100 rejected the idea , fearing it would expose the @entity27 military 's activities in @entity4			1
in his hometown of @entity24 , @entity27 flags fly from the light poles and men congregate on the steps of the @entity110			0
since @entity2 's story became public , a memorial has been erected commemorating his heroism , and his name is proudly displayed on the town 's sign			1
but now there is an addition : a hand - drawn banner reading " @entity6 winner			0
" though the battle of @entity122 took place more than four decades ago , @entity47 believes it is important to recognize the heroism of the men who were there			0
" we have these extraordinary folks in the @entity27 military who are willing to accept these types of missions and to go to these very remote places in very dangerous conditions , " he said			2
" the men that went to @entity122 had every reason to believe that no one in the public would ever know anything about what they were doing or what they had done , but they went anyway			0
" @entity2 's three sons will be at the @entity146 @entity6 ceremony tuesday			1
so will @entity64 , whose life he saved			2
" there might be some tears there			0
carpet in that @entity146 may be wet			0
but we 'll make it , " said @entity64			0
but @entity47 noted that the full story of @entity122 still is n't known			0
ten technicians who were on the @entity4 mountaintop with @entity2 , @entity64 , and @entity58 that march morning in 1968 have never been accounted for			1
@entity1 's @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report .			2
