when @entity1 became the first @entity2 to stand on top of @entity4 50 years ago , he was anything but elated			1
reaching @entity6 's highest point only 10 years after @entity8 sir @entity7 became the first to summit along with @entity11 , @entity1 said 50 mph winds were " blowing like hell , " compounding the already outrageous temperature of 35 below zero			1
the jetstream blasted @entity1 and sherpa @entity16 as @entity1 pounded the pick of his @entity2 flag into the ice			1
but when the two men looked down from their perch , 29,028 feet above sea level , they realized summiting was not their journey 's end			0
they still had far to go , and they 'd just run out of bottled oxygen on top of the world			0
" oh , boy , we 've got to get down , " @entity1 thought			1
" getting to the summit is half of the climb			2
you 're working so hard to get up , you do n't really think about anything else			2
" @entity4 , by the numbers @entity1 's expedition members ' childhoods had been filled with a passion for climbing			1
@entity40 was bitten by the mountaineering bug in 1943 when an @entity43 teacher sent students to the library to pick out a book			0
after reading about climbing , @entity47 got a summer job working at @entity50 in @entity51 , but that stint could n't sate his curiosity and zeal for exploration			2
@entity1 discovered his passion at 14 , scaling the peaks of the @entity58 @entity2 and , later , while guiding people up @entity60 in college			1
after summiting @entity63 , the highest @entity2 peak , the next natural step was " the big one , " he said			0
when the @entity2 began scaling @entity4 , their journey was far different from that of today 's climbers			1
for one , they were the only team on the mountain at the time			0
they also had to trek 185 miles through the sweltering @entity73 , their packs stuffed with cold - weather gear for when the elevation rose			0
that 's about the distance from @entity79 , @entity80 , to @entity81 , @entity82 , though the @entity84 trek involves pathways along 18,000 - foot ridges , @entity1 pointed out			1
today , climbers fly 140 miles into @entity84 and trek 40 miles into base camp			2
80 - year - old @entity90 man becomes oldest to climb @entity4 once at @entity4 , it was n't long before @entity1 's expedition experienced disaster			1
two days into the climb , three men were opening a route through the @entity97 -- where descending glaciers break off into jagged , car - and house - sized chunks -- when glacier pieces collapsed around them , burying them in ice , @entity40 said			0
he was able to climb out , but ended his summit attempt			2
@entity104 , a 27 - year - old guide from @entity106 , @entity51 , did n't survive			0
he was buried deep in the ice			0
his body would n't be recovered until much later			0
" you 're halfway around the world , " @entity1 said			1
" you immediately think of your family			0
" they were all shaken , but @entity4 's fierce conditions forbade them from dwelling on it			1
they had to keep moving			0
though the view from the peak is spectacular , the @entity118 and @entity84 unfolding beneath them , @entity1 said his team was more amazed by the scenery on their way back down			2
after months of living in thin air , they noticed the air became thicker and softer as the oxygen increased			0
at one point , they found themselves clustered , looking down at a little blade of grass coming up through the scree			0
" this green , emerald green -- @entity136 , it was just incredible , " @entity1 said			2
" there is nothing growing up above , no color -- it 's all snow , ice and rock			0
we had lost @entity104 up on the mountain but now we were coming back into life , this beautiful , lush , gorgeous planet that supports life			0
a little blade of grass just stunned the whole team			0
" almost 49 years after summiting @entity4 , @entity1 , then - 83 , found himself back at base camp in 2012			1
his son , @entity152 , 27 , wanted to reach the so - called " @entity154 " for a second time			1
@entity155 had done it without his father in 2010			0
@entity1 and his son had trekked to a base camp in 2003 , but they had no intention of summiting			1
first @entity164 woman summits @entity4 @entity1 said he never encouraged or discouraged his son from mountaineering , but his son discovered it for himself at age 15			1
after being asked so many times if he 'd follow in his dad 's footsteps up the face of @entity4 , @entity152 found his answer on their 2003 trip			1
" it was the natural power and majesty of that place that i felt some special connection to , " @entity152 said			2
" i think we all are affected by landscapes in a different way , and for me , a boy who had grown up with that idea of @entity4 in his head , seeing @entity4 for the first time made me want to climb it			2
" @entity1 hoped to walk into base camp with his son in 2012 , but a day from their destination , he caught an intestinal bug			1
the seasoned mountaineer who had once conquered @entity4 was within him , telling him to keep going , but he decided it was too dicey			1
meanwhile , @entity155 faced a different danger : overcrowding			0
ten people died on @entity4 in 2012 , raising questions about how many people should receive permits to scale the perilous peak			1
@entity4 climbers , widower recount deadly traffic jam on top of the world in 2012 @entity152 waited for more than an hour at 28,700 feet , just below the summit , as 100 people slowly descended the tricky @entity209			1
if it had n't been for calm winds may 26 , the last window of good weather , he would have been forced back down			0
" each person climbs @entity4 for different reasons			2
the reason that i climb is because i love the mountain , i love what comes with it : the view from the top , the camaraderie of good teammates , the personal challenge of the experience , pushing past your own boundaries and growing because of that experience			0
" father and son experienced the magnitude of emotion that comes with being at @entity4 together , and @entity1 is proud his son reached the summit twice			1
while the achievement continues the family legacy , @entity1 wanted his children to appreciate the life around them			2
" i came back from @entity4 without ego because you realize how insignificant you are , just a speck in the vast universe , " @entity1 said			1
" you dwell in the silence of the forest and the high mountains			0
they are the highest cathedrals in the world			0
" childhood dream leads climber up @entity4 -- twice in one week			2

mountaineer @entity1 reached the summit of @entity4 in 1963
his son , @entity152 , accomplished the same feat in 2010 and 2012
climbers now encounter challenges @entity1 did n't have to face in 1963
