-- monday 's arrest of five men accused of aiming to bomb an @entity4 bridge raises disturbing questions about the attraction to violence of some contemporary anarchists			1
but it also offers critical lessons to @entity11 about the nature of the domestic terrorist threat they faceâ € ” a threat more diverse in its ideological origins than commonly appreciated			1
since 9/11 the country has been concerned primarily with terrorist threats from militants inspired by a violent jihadist ideology , like that associated with @entity22			0
in recent years fears have focused on @entity25 " homegrown " terrorism , which typically involves plots in the @entity11 initiated by @entity11 residents and citizens who are inspired by jihadi ideology , but lack formal connections to @entity22 or foreign militant organizations			1
@entity25 homegrown terrorists may draw the attention of a nation still traumatized by 9/11 , but such plots are no more numerous or serious than those perpetrated by other domestic terrorists in the @entity11			1
as the country 's history and monday 's arrests underscore , extremism comes in many incarnations			2
focusing only on terrorism perpetrated by @entity44 misrepresents the scope and nature of domestic terrorism in the @entity11			1
it risks leaving us vulnerable to attacks from other sorts of violent idealogues and promotes a hurtfulâ € ” and pointlessâ € ” tension between @entity25 - @entity11 and other @entity11			1
there have been many instances of non-jihadist terror in the @entity11 some may recall that in the late 1960s and 1970s the country faced an onslaught of bombings and attacks by social revolutionary groups and @entity64 nationalists			1
that violent era eventually ebbed , but then in the 1980s and 1990s the country witnessed an upsurge of threats from right - wing militants			2
while @entity72 's 1995 bombing of the @entity73 in @entity74 was unusual in its lethality , it was unfortunately far from the only plot hatched by extremists on the right			1
the @entity79 documents 75 plots , of varying degrees of operational advancement , between july 1995 and june 2009 and an additional 22 from 2009 through november 2011			1
a study by the @entity83 , a research consortium in @entity84 , found that from 1999 - 2009 , in the @entity11 there were 17 @entity22 - inspired plots undertaken , 20 plots initiated by white supremacists and 17 by violent anti-government militants			1
recent attacks include the 2009 shooting of a guard at the @entity93 and the murder by " sovereign citizens " in 2010 of two @entity97 police officers at a traffic stop			0
in january 2011 , a bomb laced with rat poison was found in a backpack along the route of a @entity104 parade in @entity105 , @entity106			0
eco-terrorists and animal rights activists too have perpetrated their share of bombings and attacks in the @entity11 , especially in the last decade			2
while these groups aim to avoid civilian deaths , accidents can happen and produce sobering acts of violence			0
add to the mix militants inspired by jihadist ideology			0
in the decade following 9/11 , by my own accounting , there have been 18 plots in which militants have taken at least some preliminary operational steps to realize their deadly mission			0
like the alleged anarchist attack , 12 have involved informants and federal agents whose presence can help advance plots that otherwise may have remained aspirational			0
all but two of these plots have failed or been foiled by law enforcement : army major @entity136 's 2009 @entity135 attack and a lesser known shooting , also in 2009 , outside a @entity139 army recruiting center that harmed two soldiers			1
the perpetrators of all 18 homegrown plots had been known to law enforcement before their attempted attacks , with the exception of the may 2010 @entity147 bomber , @entity146 , whose own failings as a bomb - maker , despite his overseas training , underscore the challenges of successfully executing attacks in the contemporary @entity11			1
some may recoil at grouping right - wing , single - issue , and left - wing terrorists with militant jihadists			0
yet , there are several benefits to promoting a more comprehensive assessment of the domestic terrorist threat			0
first , it ensures that society remains vigilant against threats from different sub-groups and that law enforcement has the support and bureaucratic incentives to do the same			0
as @entity167 learned with the 2011 attacks by @entity169 , neglecting the threat from the right ( or other ideological extremes ) can leave society dangerously vulnerable			0
second , focusing our attention on domestic terrorism of all types and not just that generated by @entity44 can help heal the social rifts generated by 9/11			0
singling out @entity25 militants when we talk about terrorism in the @entity11 adds to the mutual alienation of @entity183 and @entity11 of other backgrounds			2
by unifying in opposition to extremism of all types , we demonstrate to ourselves and to our terrorist adversaries abroad that we remain true to @entity11 values and principles			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

@entity193 says foiled @entity4 bombing plot *reminder* of diversity of @entity11 terror
she says nowadays @entity11 *mistakenly* associate homegrown terror just with jihad
she says a 1999 - 2009 study found most plots white supremacist , anti-government
@entity208 : it 's *crucial* to focus efforts on extremists of all kinds , not just @entity213
