@entity6 's first @entity5 princess , featured in the movie " @entity8 : once upon a princess , " has received backlash as well as support from media outlets , especially the @entity13 community			1
is @entity6 's new princess a milestone for @entity17 or a culturally irrelevant character ? @entity6 's spokeswoman provided a recent statement to @entity0 to help clarify what exactly makes " princess sofia " latina : " the range of characters in ' @entity8 ' -- and the actors who play them -- are a reflection of @entity6 's commitment to diverse , multicultural and inclusive storytelling , and the wonderful early reaction to ' @entity8 ' affirms that commitment			1
in the story , @entity8 's mother , @entity33 @entity32 , was born in a fictitious land , @entity36 , a place with @entity39 influences			1
@entity32 met @entity8 's father , @entity40 , who hailed from the kingdom of @entity42 , and together they moved to @entity44 , where @entity8 was born			1
" " @entity8 " is a television movie and series set to debut november 18 on the @entity47 and @entity48 , aimed at children ages 2 - 7			2
@entity8 is a regular little girl whose life changes when her mother marries the king			2
@entity54 from " @entity55 " will voice @entity8 and @entity56 from " @entity57 " will voice @entity33 @entity32			0
when news first hit in december 2011 that @entity6 was going to introduce its new and much younger princess , there was no mention of @entity8 's @entity5 background , let alone that her mother was from " a place with @entity39 influences , " until this week			1
yet this week , @entity6 announced that @entity8 was indeed @entity5			2
as reported by @entity64 , a blogger on a press tour of the movie 's production offices asked why @entity8 's mother , @entity32 , had a darker complexion than the other characters			1
that led to the big reveal : " she is @entity5 , " said @entity73 , executive producer			0
according the the vice president of @entity48 original programming , " we never actually call it out			0
" " it 's sort of a matter - of - fact situation rather than an overt thing			1
" however , this is n't the first time there is controversy surrounding one of @entity6 's princesses			1
in 2009 , " @entity98 " received criticism from parents and the media for being set in @entity89 after @entity90 , its voodoo references and @entity6 's first @entity94 - @entity93 princess , @entity92 , falling in love with a @entity97 prince			1
most agree princess @entity92 was a step in the right direction , but many said there was still work to be done			0
some @entity17 applauded @entity6 's new milestone and welcomed her with open arms on @entity105 stating , " # @entity6 comes out with its first " # @entity92			1
@entity107 " and " # @entity6 finally comes out with a @entity5 princess " some criticized what they saw as a lack of cultural signifiers or ethnic identity in the @entity8 character			2
" if @entity6 were truly to finally step out and directly cater to the @entity13 community that has been crying out for decades for a @entity5 princess to represent our girls , " said @entity115 , blogger for @entity116 , " she would be as @entity5 as @entity92 is black or as @entity1 is @entity122			2
" @entity123 , president and ceo for the @entity125 , a nonprofit organization that promotes @entity13 equality in the entertainment industry , believes the @entity13 community needs more heroes right now that are very identifiable			0
" latinos are taking the blame for everything that is wrong with @entity93			0
this is not a time to pussyfoot around			0
if you 're going to promote this to the public , and @entity17 in particular , do us a favor and make it a real @entity5			0
