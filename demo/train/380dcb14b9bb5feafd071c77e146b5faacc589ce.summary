-- where would you find the most @entity4 spirit in the world ? it 's hard to say for certain , but if a global competition were to be held , the @entity7 would have an excellent shot at winning			1
the southeast @entity11 island nation has the world 's longest festive season -- and pulls no punches in its celebratory zeal for the period , with lavish light displays , masses , and festivals held throughout the country from september until january			1
one of the most populous nations in @entity11 , the @entity7 is an overwhelmingly @entity22 nation			2
approximately 90 % of @entity7 are @entity22 and 80 % of those are @entity24 , an influence gleaned from the country 's period as a @entity29 colony from the sixteenth century until the end of the nineteenth			2
as a result , while many countries concentrate on the commercial side of @entity4 , @entity7 attend several masses throughout the @entity4 season and faith forms an intrinsic part of celebrations			1
a traditionally @entity7 event is @entity41 , a series of masses held over nine nights culminating in @entity45			2
it is believed that if you make a wish after completing the nine masses , it will come true			0
as early as september , when the dark nights come , it is not unusual to see a series of spectacular @entity4 displays popping up in malls , parks and open spaces across the country			1
student @entity59 from @entity60 in the @entity7 loves the beautiful ' parols ' , lights created by artisan @entity63 in 1928 and originally made of bamboo and paper that are hung up throughout towns and villages			1
" [ the parols are ] as important to @entity7 as the christmas tree to western culture -- without parols @entity4 would n't be complete , " he declared			1
" the lanterns were used by people to light their paths during the ritual yuletide dawn masses called ' @entity75 ' [ midnight mass ] , because electricity was unavailable at the time in many rural areas			2
" such lanterns are now more likely to glow with electronic lights , but the ethos remains the same -- a guiding light in the darkness for worshippers wanting to congregate and pray			2
to @entity86 , the striking lanterns are a comforting indication that @entity4 is on its way and a fond reminder of how her community comes together every year to string up the beautiful lights			2
" even i can not help myself from smiling whenever i pass by that street and think of how devoted @entity7 are in celebrating @entity4 , " said @entity86 , who lives in @entity93 , @entity60			1
" this happens only once a year , so residents combine their efforts to put them up			0
" student @entity98 from @entity99 , @entity60 , says the light displays in his town 's local gardens regularly dazzle residents			1
" the lighting of the park during the @entity4 season is done yearly and now became a huge attraction to people not only from [ my ] area , but from the outside , too , " he said			1
decorations can also inspire a competitive spirit			0
student @entity112 said that in some local villages , they organize contests for the most beautiful @entity4 decorations			1
the tree set up by her home in @entity120 was at least 30 ft tall - and larger ones are not uncommon			0
photos : @entity124 sightings around the world @entity98 also mentioned another @entity4 tradition of which @entity7 residents are fond -- gathering together to make and enjoy food specifically made for the @entity4 season			1
for example , @entity45 , or @entity130 , is traditionally when families come together to host a large festive meal			0
the celebration is well known in @entity135 and @entity136 and stems from the nation 's colonial past			0
in addition to the aforementioned @entity45 dinner , scores of delicious , and often highly unusual , dishes are prepared for @entity7 to gorge themselves on			0
these include puto bumbong , glutinous purple rice stuffed into bamboo tubes with butter , sugar and coconut , and @entity149 , balls of cheese with red waxy coverings			0
@entity153 from @entity154 in @entity60 province loves the mouth - watering @entity4 delicacies from food stall sellers who set up beside an enormous display of @entity4 lights , showcasing the dizzying breadth and variety of @entity7 cuisine			1
" at @entity4 , we cook our own barbeque and hotdogs and buy several kinds of rice cake called ' bibingka ' , " she said			0
" we @entity7 would always decorate our center table with colorful fruits and rice cakes			0
we would also prepare fruit or ' buko ' [ a type of young coconut ] salads for dessert			0
but amidst the festivities , some @entity180 felt it important to send in reminders of those who face a more austere @entity4			0
@entity186 's poignant images showed the plight of children forced to leave their homes after a series of deadly typhoons caused severe flooding in august in some parts of the country			0
having lost most of their belongings , many relied on @entity24 charities to provide them with some @entity4 spirit			0
" i saw that the parents were more excited to receive presents than the kids and the moment was heart - melting , " he said			0
" helping others is a tradition in the @entity7 at @entity4 , especially those who are really in need			1
" his touching @entity209 is a reminder for those celebrating @entity4 -- in the @entity7 and beyond -- that many of us have much to be thankful for this holiday season			1
