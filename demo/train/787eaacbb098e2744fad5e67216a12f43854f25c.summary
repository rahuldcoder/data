when the discussion turns to the @entity3 - @entity2 border , living less than an hour away has its privileges			1
i 've covered the international boundary from three states ( @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 ) and from every conceivable angle -- including from the air			0
i once went up in a @entity14 helicopter that started at the @entity15 and flew east over the fence line			0
on the @entity2 side , homeowners in @entity18 were using the scrap metal wall put up by @entity3 taxpayers as their backyard fence			1
down the road , groups of young men waited patiently for their chance to cross			0
what @entity3 consider an impenetrable barrier , the desperate and determined see as a speed bump on the road to a better life			1
i 've learned over a quarter - century of writing about immigration from the @entity33 to be skeptical about claims that the federal government can fully secure the 1,969 - mile @entity3 - @entity2 border			1
do n't tell that to sens. @entity38 of @entity39 and @entity40 of @entity41			2
the @entity43 senators have proposed an amendment to the @entity47 's " @entity46 " immigration bill			1
it would increase the size of the @entity14 by 20,000 agents , and complete 700 miles of border fencing			2
the amendment might get the bill some @entity43 votes			0
but it probably wo n't do much to secure the border			1
the property line between the two countries goes through everything from deserts to mountains to private ranch land to a university to the @entity64			0
ever try to build a fence on a river ? it 's not easy			0
@entity3 can build walls and fences , triple the number of @entity14 agents , and deploy @entity72 if they like			2
yet , it wo n't make much difference			1
talk to the experts -- the @entity14 agents -- and they 'll tell you : there is no impediment that a person wo n't go around , over or under if it means being able to feed his family			1
speaking of " under , " law enforcement officials say there are likely hundreds of sophisticated drug tunnels all along the @entity3 - @entity2 border built by drug cartels			1
the smugglers who used to move illegal drugs have now branched out and smuggle illegal immigrants			0
there is evidence that they 're moving their human cargo through the tunnels -- underneath all the nifty and expensive enforcement tools deployed on the surface			0
advocates of border security disagree that the crackdown is n't working			1
they insist that the fact that the flow of @entity2 immigrants into the @entity3 is at a historic low is attributable to the billions of dollars we 've spent on everything from border fencing and additional @entity14 agents to high - tech surveillance equipment			1
that shows how little they know			0
there are two major reasons that fewer people are coming , and neither of them originated on the @entity3 side of the border			1
first , there are more opportunities than there have been in recent years to make a decent living in @entity2			2
and there is a sluggish economy in the @entity3			2
so all things being equal , more @entity2 are deciding that migrating to " el norte " is n't worth the hassle			1
second , our border crackdowns have been very beneficial to at least one group -- coyote smugglers			0
every time we build a mile of fencing or deploy more agents , we make it harder for them to do business , so they raise their prices			0
a trip across the border that , 10 years ago , cost about $ 500 now runs as much as $ 4,000 -- more if you absolutely , positively have to be there overnight			0
many @entity2 have sticker shock			2
honestly , it makes you wonder if @entity43 in @entity143 are in cahoots with the immigrant smugglers			0
one is putting money into the pocket of the other			0
if you want to know why the @entity3 has had such a tough time controlling illegal immigration over the years , there 's one reason			1
what other law enforcement operation can you think of where the harder you crack down , the wealthier and more powerful the bad guys get so they can come back and fight you even harder the next time ? here 's the elephant in the @entity143 caucus room : @entity3 will never control illegal immigrants until lawmakers -- in both parties -- " man up " and risk angering the businesses that contribute to political campaigns by fining and locking up @entity3 employers who hire illegal immigrants			1
and let 's not forget one of the biggest offenders , who is somehow never mentioned by the media -- the @entity3 household , with its growing dependence on nannies , housekeepers , gardeners , senior care givers and other helpers			1
adding to the problem , pro-border security conservatives confuse " securing " the border with " sealing " the border			2
they say they want to secure the border			0
but when you hear the details -- i.e. , the " 100 % awareness " rate and " 90 % apprehension " rate called for by an amendment from sen. @entity190 of @entity10 , who is almost certainly going to vote against the @entity47 bill anyway -- it 's clear that what these folks really want is to seal the border			2
there is a big difference between securing and sealing			0
the former is feasible ; the second is a fantasy			0
anyway , i suspect that a lot of this is smoke and mirrors and that the @entity43 senators who want to block immigration reform are merely seizing on border security as an excuse			1
conservatives saying that we ca n't have immigration reform before we secure the @entity3 - @entity2 border is like liberals saying we ca n't have more welfare reform until we end poverty			1
that 's never going to happen , and they know it			0
so we 're just playing games			0
in the meantime , millions of people are stuck in the legal equivalent of suspended animation , and a once - in - a - generation opportunity to fix a broken system is being wasted .			2
