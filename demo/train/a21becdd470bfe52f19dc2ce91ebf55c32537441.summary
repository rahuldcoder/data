woods , who is playing only his second tournament after four months out with injuries to his left leg , carded a three - over - par 73 to go with his opening 77 for a 36 - hole total of 150 ( +10 ) , six shots off the cut			1
the 35 - year - old , who has won 14 majors , has previously failed to make the final two rounds at the 2006 @entity24 and the @entity25 , and on this occasion it means he will not be able to compete in the @entity29 playoffs for the @entity30			0
@entity31 : the gentleman who shaped modern golf only the top 125 players in this year 's rankings are eligible to compete and the world number 30 was ranked 129th prior to the start of the tournament			1
" i 'll have nothing to do now but work on my game , " @entity1 told the @entity29 website after confirming he will not play until november 's @entity40 in @entity41			2
" @entity44 ( coach ) and i have n't had the opportunity to really sit down and do a lot of work , so this will be our time			0
" woods , who recorded five double bogeys over two rounds for the first time in any tournament , added : " i showed signs that i can hit the ball exactly how i know i can but unfortunately i just did n't do it enough times			2
" this year has been frustrating because i was feeling healthy going into the masters , put it together there , and was leading the tournament with a few holes to go			2
" then obviously i got hurt and i have n't played since , really			0
i have not been able to practice and work and obviously compete			0
" @entity1 was not the only big name player to miss the cut on a day when some of the @entity29 's lesser lights shone			1

top overseas players @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity85 @entity24 champion @entity84 are also all on their way home			0
meanwhile , top @entity6 names @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 will not be returning for the final two days			0
however , home players are dominating proceedings at the other end , with @entity7 carding a best - of - the - day six - under 64 to share the lead with @entity5 , who posted a 65 , on 135 ( -5 )			1
the 34 - year - old @entity5 , who has never won on the @entity29 , is a surprise leader having missed five of his last six cuts , but 25 - year - old rookie @entity7 has been a revelation in his first season , winning the prestigious @entity102 earlier this year			1
the pair hold a one - stroke lead over compatriots @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 , along with @entity41 @entity109			0
a further four players , including leading @entity112 @entity111 of @entity113 and overnight leader @entity114 -- who followed up his opening 63 with a disappointing 74 -- are another shot behind			0
last week 's @entity118 winner @entity117 is among three players just three shots off the lead , while world @entity121 is four off the pace after a 68 and world @entity124 is six behind after carding a 71 .			2

the former world number one finishes six shots away from making the cut
it is only the third time @entity1 has missed the cut in a major tournament
@entity5 and @entity7 lead the way on five - under after 36 holes
