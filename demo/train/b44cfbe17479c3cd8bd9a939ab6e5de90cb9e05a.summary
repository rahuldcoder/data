-- the waters of the @entity2 have for millennia flowed down from the @entity5 highlands enriching the countries on its banks			2
the rocks that make up its riverbed have been eroded by @entity5 's past and now that the construction of @entity16 's largest hydro - electric dam has begun , these same rocks are helping to build the country 's future			1
the @entity20 project was announced last year by the @entity5 government , in a unilateral move that is not sitting very well with its downstream neighbors			1
@entity24 and @entity25 say @entity5 is threatening their greatest natural resource			1
what 's undisputed though is the sheer size of this undertaking close to @entity5 's border with @entity25			1
" it 's not very easy to build a project of this magnitude in a remote area , " explains @entity32 , who oversees this project for @entity34 , the @entity36 construction firm that has been contracted by the @entity5 to build the dam			1
according to @entity32 , 10 % of the dam has been completed so far and teams are working day and night to stay on schedule			0
" this is one of the largest dams in the world , " @entity32 says			0
" the effort of this country is really , really impressive			0
they will produce clean energy using natural resources			0
" more from @entity52 : @entity53 pm : @entity25 conflict threatens world oil prices if construction stays on schedule the dam will be complete in six years			2
@entity5 says the dam will generate 6,000 mega watts of electricity and it will sell a proportion of that to its neighbors and use the rest to fuel its own growth			2
@entity68 is the @entity5 engineer in charge of overseeing this mammoth project			2
he has worked on three other dams in @entity5 , but this will be his and his country 's first attempt at damming the @entity2			2
" this @entity76 river originates from our country and flows without giving any benefit to us so now we are able to utilize this river , " he explains			0
meeting @entity68 , it becomes obvious that this project is a source of immense personal and national pride and in @entity5 at least he has become a bit of a celebrity -- he regularly gets stopped in the street by people congratulation him on the dam and asking how it is progressing			1
it might be a source of pride for @entity68 and @entity5 , but for @entity24 and @entity25 this project is deeply contentious			1
@entity24 with its population time bomb is particularly worried -- nearly 85 % of its water originates in @entity5			1
@entity24 say they will not be held hostage over water , explains @entity98 , who is an expert on hydro - politics at @entity100			1
" @entity25 and @entity24 have got their concerns			1
building a huge project on the water that goes down to @entity25 , they would think that water would be controlled by @entity5 and @entity5 would be much more powerful in terms of influence in the @entity76			1
" the @entity106 that is meant to govern the use of the @entity2 between the three nations was in fact signed by colonial powers in the region			0
@entity5 says it never signed the agreement and the so - called @entity113 only provides a framework for the use of the @entity76 waters			2
more from @entity52 : using the web to fight corruption @entity24 and @entity25 are particularly worried that this dam will allow @entity5 to control the flow of water			1
@entity5 denies this and says it will use machines to monitor and ensure the flow remains stable			1
@entity5 's prime minister @entity125 has dismissed these concerns and warned against what he called " dam extremists			2
" @entity125 and his government stress that this dam project could potentially transform @entity5 's economy			1
it is a view shared by some of the diplomatic community in @entity135 , @entity5 's capital			0
one diplomat told @entity137 that this dam will be " like an atm of hard currency for @entity5 "			2
many economists also agree on the dam 's economic potential			0

" this is a signal of self - reliance			0
this is a signal of @entity5 moving from an aid dependent economy to a can - do economy			1
we 're going to do this with or without you			0
the @entity5 government is issuing bonds and the population , all 85 million of us , are buying bonds in order to chip in to this huge @entity76 project			2
" but will @entity5 be able to raise enough money to continue to build this dam ? some economists believe the country has only raised 10 % of the project 's total cost			1
there are also reports that civil servants have been forced to contribute one month 's salary towards the project			0
these are accusations the government denies			0
@entity185 , an organization working against destructive riverside projects , says that the @entity5 government has not allowed an open discussion about the funding and merits of this dam			0
@entity185 points to the case of an @entity5 journalist @entity192 who has been jailed for daring to criticize the government 's centerpiece project			0
@entity5 authorities say @entity196 is on trial over terror charges			0
what is not up for debate is how determined @entity5 is to fulfill its aspiration as the " battery of @entity16			1
" all over @entity135 , new buildings are rising			0
according the @entity204 , @entity5 's economy last year grew by 7.5 % and although inflation also rose to 31.5 % the country has successful grown its average income by 50 % over the past decade			1
the @entity209 , though , is ringing alarm bells			0
given this region 's history of drought , the @entity209 is recommending that governments avoid dependency on hydropower as an engine of growth			0
as they dig into ancient bedrock for their futuristic dam , it seems the @entity5 believe this is a risk worth taking .			0

@entity5 is building the largest hydro - electric dam in @entity16
the country says the @entity20 project could transform its economy
but neighboring @entity24 and @entity25 *fearful* that their water supply is under threat
@entity5 says it will use machines to monitor and ensure the flow of water is stable
