-- gone but not forgotten			2
@entity1 , a 20 - year - old @entity2 student , disappeared in october 2009			1
her remains were found a few months later			1
her death remains a mystery , but it 's back in the news this week because of the arrest of @entity8 -- the only known suspect in the disappearance of @entity12 student @entity11			1
@entity13 have not said how the two cases are connected , except to say there is a " new forensic link			2
" they are pursing that link with the hope of being able to provide , finally , some sort of closure for the @entity1 family -- whatever that may look like			1
" there 's a suspect , and possibility of a link to @entity1 's murder , and i am so pleased that that has happened , but it does n't change a lot for us , in some ways , " @entity1 's mother , @entity25 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity26 on monday			1
" you know , our bedroom is still empty upstairs			2
we 're still not going to have the grandchildren , the wedding , those things , " she said			0
can arrest in @entity11 disappearance solve other cases ? the disappearance @entity1 disappeared on october 17 , 2009 , after attending a @entity46 concert at the @entity12 's @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49			1
she had been so excited about the concert , according to her mother , that she posted the tickets on the refrigerator about six months ahead of time			0
she tried on three outfits before settling on what to wear , a crystal necklace and a black t - shirt with the word " @entity60 " spelled out in tan letters			2
police say she left her friends to use the restroom during the concert			0
when she did not return , her friends called her cell phone			0
@entity1 told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its re-entry policy but not to worry and that she would find a ride home			1
there are restroom inside the arena and , to this day , it 's not clear why she left			0
witnesses later saw someone matching @entity1 's description walking along a nearby bridge			1
no further sightings were reported			0
@entity1 's purse , along with her identification and cell phone , was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena			1
her remains were discovered january 2010 on a nearby farm			1
another link on a website dedicated to @entity1 , the education major is described as a " true original			1
" " @entity90 is moving on so very quickly , but we are not			0
we are stuck in the limbo of not knowing , the purgatory of no answers , no justice			0
how can it be possible that 4 years ! of investigation has not ferreted out your murderer ( s ? ) we are determined to do just that , find him			0
frantic actually , to find him before he kills again , " it reads			0
besides the connection to the @entity107 case , police have linked @entity1 's death with the kidnapping and assault of another woman in @entity112 , @entity49 , in 2005			1
that woman , who survived the attack , was able to provide police with enough of a description to make a sketch			0
authorities have not publicly identified the woman who gave the description but have said her case was connected to @entity1 's case through dna			1
if @entity8 is linked to @entity1 's death , and @entity1 's death is linked to the kidnapping and rape of the woman in @entity112 , then is @entity8 linked to the @entity112 case ? so many questions			1
but there 's at least one thing @entity1 's family knows -- and for which it is grateful			2
" i know where @entity1 is			2
however this unfolds , i know where my girl is			0
she 's in a box in the living room , " @entity1 's mother told @entity26			2
" @entity11 's family do not know where their daughter is , " she said			2
" we need to find her			0
the investigation needs to find her and , most of all , her family needs to find her			0
" @entity151 's @entity150 and @entity0 's @entity152 and @entity153 contributed to this report .			0
