-- the voice on telephone messages left for @entity3 matches that of the 22 - year - old man who says he posed as a woman in carrying on a relationship -- by e-mail and over the phone -- with the @entity10 linebacker , according to the " @entity12 " show			1
" they all say , with scientific certainty , that @entity19 is the female voice in those recordings , " host @entity13 said , citing conclusions by forensic voice analysts with three independent contractors			1
that conclusion supports @entity23 's assertion that , posing as a woman , he was involved in a relationship with @entity3 , who had not known that his love interest was a man			2
@entity3 rose to prominence while leading @entity10 's @entity29 to an undefeated regular season			2
this year 's @entity33 runner - up , he told interviewers in september and october that his grandmother and girlfriend , whom he described as a 22 - year - old @entity38 student , had died within hours of each other			2
the sports website @entity41 broke the story last month that the girlfriend @entity3 talked about was n't real			2
@entity13 reported in the first part of the two - part interview , which aired thursday , that the voice analysts had concluded that the voice used by @entity23 in the interview was likely not that of the person who had left the voice mail messages on the gridiron star 's answering machine			1
@entity13 asked the confessed hoaxer repeatedly to adopt the female voice he said he had used with @entity3 in order to prove that it was he , but @entity19 refused , saying he was not comfortable appearing on camera sounding like a woman			1
@entity3 to @entity59 : my emotions were real a first attempt at overcoming his objection -- putting @entity23 behind a screen in @entity13 's home , where the interview took place -- resulted in equivocal findings from the voice analysts			1
but when the venue was switched to @entity19 's house , where he said he had made the calls to @entity3 , the results were uniformly in agreement , @entity13 said			1
@entity19 told @entity13 that the ruse had its roots in sexual abuse he endured from someone close to his family that began when he was 12 years of age			1
" it started off with a hand and then touching and stuff like that , " he told the talk show host in the segment that aired friday			2
" i did n't know what was going on			2
" @entity19 said he kept to himself knowledge of the abuse , which escalated to rape , out of fear that his parents would become angry if they were to find out and that it might drive his father -- who was already out of town much of the time -- to leave			1
" i knew that i could not go forward with that , " he said			2
@entity19 said he went on to create an alter persona -- the fictional @entity100			1
" i felt that i could n't do things , accomplish things , pursue things , live out as @entity19 , " @entity19 said to @entity13			1
" and i felt the need to create this			0
it has everything to do with what i went through as a child and my experience with child molestation and abuse			1
" asked why he had not created a fictional man instead , he said that it was because he had been " abused as if i was a girl			0
" in the initial segment , which aired thursday , @entity19 said the athlete knew nothing about the ruse			1
" he had no idea , " he said			0
@entity3 has said he was not a part of the hoax			2
asked whether he was in love with @entity3 , @entity19 said : " i mean , yeah ... as twisted and confusing as it may be , yeah , i cared for this person			1
i did all that i could to help this person become a better person , even though i was n't getting nothing out of it			0
of course , it 's very shameful and it 's very painful to even talk about			0
even now , it 's hard to talk about			0
but , you know , the truth of it is that that happened			0
i grew emotions that , sooner or later , i could n't control any more			0
" asked whether he is gay , @entity19 said , " i would say , yeah , i am gay , but honestly , i am so confused , i 'm so lost			1
" @entity139 : twitter erupts as hoaxer tells story to @entity12 @entity19 said the relationship began after he started a @entity146 page under the name @entity100 , the first name an elision of his mother 's and grandmother 's first names and the last name one he had heard " thrown around in the neighborhood			1
" he said he " randomly added different people " as @entity146 friends with the persona he had created			0
" one of the people i happened to add was his cousin , " he said , referring to @entity3 's cousin			0
" shortly after , i got a friend request , and it was from @entity3			0
" they began speaking nightly , and @entity3 seemed to have been smitten , too , @entity19 said			1
" he really had fallen in love with this , we 'll say , character			0
" a love story unravels @entity19 said his motives were pure ; he never tried to make money off their relationship			1
" i just wanted to help him become better , " he said			0
the charade became difficult to maintain , and he tried to end it several times			0
" there are many times where @entity3 and @entity100 had broken up			0
but something would bring them back together , whether it was something going on in his life or @entity100 's life , in this case in my life , " @entity19 said			1
he added : " i wanted to end it because after everything i had gone through i wanted to move on with my life			0
me , @entity19 , i had to just start living and let this go			1
" finally , after learning that @entity3 had skyped with four women -- including two of his former girlfriends -- @entity19 said he essentially killed off @entity100 , having her die of leukemia			2
" i was just trying to do everything to end it because i knew that , no matter what , you know , it just was n't right -- and it was never going to be			0
" who 's who on the @entity199 ? who knows in friday 's segment , @entity19 apologized to all those he hurt , including @entity3 , @entity205 's family and his own family			2
" i ca n't express how sorry i am , " he said			0
" the truth is i hurt every day for the decisions i have made			0
" ' @entity210 ' masks identities online @entity0 's @entity212 contributed to this report .			0

three forensic voice analysts all reached the same conclusion , " @entity12 " says
@entity19 says the hoax was linked to sexual abuse he endured beginning at age 12
" it has everything to do with what i went through as a child , " he says on show
