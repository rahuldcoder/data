the machete blades turned red with heat in the fire that the rubber workers built on a @entity6 plantation , @entity3 remembers from a visit in the 1980s			2
this was how the men tried to quell the intense itchiness that comes with river blindness , a rare tropical disease			1
" you can imagine how bad the itching must be , that running a red - hot machete up and down your back would be a relief , but it was , " said @entity3 , whose laboratory works on diagnostic tests for the disease			1
about 18 million people have river blindness worldwide , according to the @entity24 , but more than 99 % of cases of this disease are found in @entity27			1
it goes by the technical name " onchocerciasis , " and it spreads through small black flies that breed in fast - flowing , highly oxygenated waters			2
when an infected fly bites a person , it drops worm larvae in the skin , which can then grow and reproduce in the body			1
unlike malaria , river blindness is not fatal , but it causes a " miserable life , " said @entity42 , senior epidemiologist for the @entity45 - based @entity44 's @entity43 , which has been leading an effort to eliminate the disease in the @entity48 and several @entity27 countries			1
some strains cause blindness , while others come with more severe skin disease			1
with time , generally all strains of the disease can lead to rough " lizard " skin , depigmented " leopard skin " and hanging groins			1
another big problem among patients is itching , which happens when the worms die inside a person			2
in southwest @entity65 , the locals call the disease " @entity70 , " referring to the symptoms of distorted skin appearance and itchiness , @entity42 said			1
in western @entity65 , he said , " the fly is called ' @entity72 fly ' or dog fly , for it bites like a dog ! " there is no vaccine for river blindness , but there is a drug , called ivermectin that paralyzes and kills the offspring of adult worms , according to the @entity83			1
it may also slow the reproduction of adult female worms , so there are fewer of them in the skin , blood and eyes			1
the pharmaceutical company @entity92 has been donating the treatment , under the brand name @entity95 , since 1985			2
elimination efforts great strides have been made against this disease			1
in the @entity48 , it was eliminated in @entity100 in 2007 and in @entity101 in 2009			2
the biggest area of concern is @entity27			2
in 1995 the @entity104 for @entity105 was founded by a group of nongovernmental organizations , governments , and @entity110 agencies , with the @entity24 overseeing it			2
the @entity112 partnership , which includes the @entity44 , has given out 500 million ivermectin treatments between 1995 and 2010 , according to a new study in the journal @entity116			1
rare tropical disease close to eradication the organizations and governments involved in @entity112 have collectively avoided 8.2 million years of life that would have been lost to unhealthiness as a result of this disease from 1995 to 2010 , the study said			1
the study projected that @entity112 's impact will be even greater from 2011 to 2015 , avoiding 9.2 million years of life that would have otherwise been lived in agony from this disease			1
in @entity65 , @entity42 's home country , the country 's goal is to eliminate the disease by 2020			1
the @entity132 and the @entity44 , partners of @entity112 , are working toward making that happen			1
instead of the standard ivermectin treatment of once a year , @entity42 and colleagues have been working on distribution every six months			0
more frequent treatments eliminate more baby worms and reduce the reproductive capacity of the adult female worms inside patients ' bodies , @entity42 said			1
where possible , they are also treating fast - flowing waters with a biodegradable insecticide called @entity147 to wipe out the larvae of the infectious black fly population			0
and they are training local populations to give out the medicine and keep track of who has been treated			0
' you never sleep ' it ca n't be overstated that the worms itch , a lot			0
sometimes , said @entity3 , people infected with the worms are driven to suicide			0
@entity42 also has stories of people inflicting harm upon themselves because of the itchiness			0
there are cases where people boil water to pour on themselves , he said			0
" you scratch yourself until you damage your skin , " @entity42 explains			1
this leads to other health problems : the scratch marks bleed , making you more prone to bacterial infections			0
children with the worms ca n't concentrate because they are scratching themselves all day and night			0
" you never sleep , " @entity42 said			0
" some people use a clay pot and break it to scratch themselves because the nails are not enough			0
" relief from itchiness comes with the ivermectin -- even for someone who has lived with the disease for more than 50 years , he said			2
by taking the drug frequently , the skin can partly heal			2
unfortunately , for patients who lose all sight , blindness is irreversible because the optic nerve is damaged			2
skin that has hardened , sometimes to the point where needles ca n't penetrate it , will not reverse itself , either			2
the side effects from the medicine can also be nasty : @entity95 may cause fever , itching , skin rash , joint or muscle pain , rapid heartbeat , and painful , tender glands			2
less common side effects include headache and swelling of a person 's hands , feet , legs , face or arms			0
a person can also suffer a serious allergic reaction from it , so health workers bring antihistamines			0
" if your immune system is very efficient , it will try to attack the dead worms " that the medicine kills , @entity42 explained			0
" the itchiness that will be triggered is incredible			0
it happens within 10 minutes			0
" but most of the reaction subsides after two days			0
during that time , other biting insects such as mosquitoes , lice and bedbugs also die if they attempt to bite the treated patient			0
guinea worm a greater challenge than smallpox because of the observed benefits of treating river blindness , infected people agree to take the medication despite the side effects , @entity42 said			1
" when people see you with that skin , they do n't want to be near you , " @entity42 said			2
how disease creates outcasts one patient who made a big impression on @entity247 was @entity248 from the @entity250 district of @entity65			1
in 1992 , @entity248 's skin looked like it was covered in dried mud , and flies swarmed around him			2
no one from his village wanted to be near him and he lived in a hut behind his family 's home , separated from everyone else			0
" he was really forgotten , " @entity42 said			0
@entity248 's skin was so thick , because of river blindness , that it could break a needle			1
@entity42 told the local health workers to give @entity264 a dose of ivermectin every three months , which is more often than the standard distribution			0
years later , when @entity42 visited again , a man approached him and hugged him , smiling			0
" who are you ? " @entity42 asked			0
two years later , they reunited again , and @entity248 revealed that he had married and wanted many children			0
@entity42 also remembers educating a particular community in northwest @entity65 in 1993 , which had all the right conditions for black flies that transmit river blindness to breed			1
a group of women in the community told @entity42 that because of river blindness , people from surrounding areas did not want to marry anyone from their village			1
as a result , marriages had to happen within the community , including among relatives			0
incest was strictly forbidden in their culture , but because of river blindness , it happened quietly , @entity42 said			1
when @entity42 returned five years later , the skin of infected individuals had greatly improved , and marriages with outsiders were happening again			2
" these are stories of sadness , but after a few years there is hope , " @entity42 said			0
empowering populations @entity42 has taken the approach of making use of @entity65 villages ' kinship structures to assist with health care			1
people in villages often live on the land that belonged to their families several generations back , and do not move away in adulthood			0
this means that cousins live near each other , too , and will help with care for family members who are absent when health workers visit			0
it is easier and more efficient to distribute medications when tapping into these large family structures , @entity42 said			0
through this approach , many more women have joined the effort to distribute the medicines because they are comfortable working among their family members			2
toward elimination elimination in 2020 is the goal for @entity65 , but river blindness is harder to control in some parts of the country because of environmental and political factors , @entity3 said			1
there are places where insecticide resistance is a problem with a particular species of black fly that also moves around a lot , he said , especially on the border with @entity342 and the @entity343			0
doing any kind of river blindness control in @entity343 is problematic because of safety issues , he said			1
a lack of government structure also makes it hard for health workers to coordinate efforts			0
but the flies do n't respect the border between @entity343 and @entity65 , and people belonging to the same tribe in both countries migrate across , too			1
" if you 're controlling it on the @entity65 side , and doing nothing on the @entity343 side , " @entity3 said , " you 're never going to really eliminate it until you deal with these cross-border issues , and get an effective program going			1
" @entity3 commended the work that the @entity44 has been doing			1
he and @entity42 travel together to @entity65 every year			1
they are both part of an expert committee on river blindness through the country 's @entity132			1
" when summertime rolls around , and the rains start to come and the flies go out , that 's when we need to be there , " @entity3 said .			0

@entity44 in @entity45 leading an effort to eliminate river blindness in several countries
