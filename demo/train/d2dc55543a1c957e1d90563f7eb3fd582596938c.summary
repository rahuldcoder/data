@entity0 -- on first glance , the new , never - to - be - actually - named @entity3 is exactly the same as its predecessor : same size , same price , same colors			0
but guts count for something			1
and the guts of the new @entity3 -- do n't you dare call it ipad 3 -- are what make this tablet computer a step forward from the ipad 2			1
they 're also what give @entity20 execs some room to claim this device as " amazing " and " revolutionary , " rather than run - of - the - mill and incremental			1
the truth is that the new @entity20 @entity3 probably falls somewhere in the middle			0
it 's neither dud nor game - changer			1
i got to handle the new tablet for a few minutes after @entity20 's launch event wednesday			1
my first impressions : the screen the main upgrade is the screen , which is markedly crisper			0
@entity20 says it quadrupled the number of pixels on the @entity3 's 9.7 - inch display to the point that there are now 3.1 million pixels on the screen , with a total resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels			1
color saturation on the device was increased 44 % relative to the @entity3 2 , the company says			1
" your retina in your eye can not discern those individual pixels , " @entity20 's @entity46 said at the news conference			1
" the images on it look stunning			0
" @entity54 : new @entity3 up close that 's not overstatement			2
images do seem to have jumped out of the real world			0
that 's good for people who want to watch movies , look at photos and play games on the new @entity3			1
it also could be a big step forward for people who want to read digital books on the device			2
@entity67 the text on the latest - gen @entity3 , and the letters maintain their quality			0
the edges of the fonts are perfectly smooth , as if they 're molded from plastic			0
" one of the @entity3 's biggest competitors has been paper , " said @entity74 , a tech columnist at the @entity75 , " and now this is better than paper			2
" gaming another new feature of the guts : the @entity85 " quad - core " chip , which is supposed to help render graphics much more quickly			2
this could be a boon for gamers , who likely will see high - resolution and more graphics - intensive games coming out for the tablet			1
in a short demo on wednesday , a flying game called " @entity96 " looked like nothing you would expect to see on a mobile device			1
mountains and valleys appear photo - realistic , and the steam coming out of the back of the plane warps the sky around it			0
during its presentation , @entity20 highlighted gaming as a big advantage of the latest @entity3			0
" this new device has more memory and higher screen resolution than an @entity115 or a @entity116 , " said @entity113 , president of @entity114			2
apps @entity20 announced several new ones , and while these should work on older versions of the @entity3 , they 're designed to take advantage of the new tablet 's better screen			1
@entity123 is among the standouts			0
@entity20 's photo - organization software really comes to life on the high - def @entity3 , where users will be able to sharpen their photos with new features			2
one detects the horizon in a landscape photo and , with the tap of a finger , will make it perfectly level			0
another lets users rub a finger over a section of a photograph to lighten , darken or soften it			0
it makes photo editing more hands - on and intuitive than before			2
connectivity while it 's far from clear that tablet owners really want to connect to the internet over cellular data networks ( rather than @entity149 , which is often free but , of course , is n't available everywhere ) , the new @entity3 has 4g capabilities for those who do			1
in a demo , @entity20 reps showed videos loading considerably faster on the new ipad than on the ipad 2			1
again , this plays into @entity20 's hope that this will be an even - better device for viewing media			1
" this new @entity3 has the most wireless bands of any device that has ever shipped , and it is truly revolutionary , " @entity20 's @entity46 said during a news conference			1
who 's to say whether these updates will lead people to want to purchase the new @entity3 , or to upgrade from a previous version			2
nothing about the @entity3 was completely overhauled , but the overall user experience is crisper and speedier than before			0
we 'll leave you to be the judge			0
let us know what you think of these updates in the comments section			0
does this new @entity3 sound like it 's worth the cash ?			0
