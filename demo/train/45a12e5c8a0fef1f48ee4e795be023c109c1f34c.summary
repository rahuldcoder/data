@entity1 sheriff @entity0 and his attorneys thursday condemned a @entity5 @entity4 civil rights investigation as politically motivated and a " witch hunt			1
" that response came after the @entity4 laid out a stark , detailed list of alleged systematic discrimination against @entity10 by @entity0 , who is known internationally as " @entity12 's toughest sheriff " for his hard - line stance against lawbreakers and undocumented migrants			1
in alleging the @entity16 committed federal and constitutional violations , a 22 - page @entity4 letter described " a pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against @entity10 at @entity16 that reaches the highest levels of the agency			1
" @entity0 responded by telling reporters he had " an idea of the politics involved in law enforcement " after 28 years of working with the @entity4 as a law enforcement official in @entity25 , @entity12 , @entity26 and @entity1			1
@entity0 is a former agent for the @entity30			2
he pointed out how president @entity32 opposed @entity1 's controversial anti-immigration law now before the @entity5 @entity34 and how the president mentioned @entity0 as the person pushing the law , the sheriff said			1
" by the way , i do n't want to say it 's all politics , but everyone i 'm talking about happens to be @entity43 , " said @entity0 , a @entity38			2
@entity0 added : " do n't come to use me as a whipping boy for a national , international problem			2
" the @entity4 letter said detention officers in @entity0 's jail invoked offensive slurs and profanities against @entity51 , calling them " wetbacks , " " @entity54 bitches , " and " stupid @entity25			1
" " sheriff @entity0 's own actions have helped nurture @entity16 's culture of bias , " said the letter , written to the @entity57 attorney			1
for example , the sheriff apparently endorsed one constituent 's letter asking for a " round - up " at one @entity68 street corner of " dark - skin ( ned ) " people : @entity0 told a member of his command staff in a note to " ( h ) ave someone handle this , " the @entity4 said			1
@entity0 disputed the @entity4 accusation that systematic civil right violations against @entity10 has created " a wall of distrust " in the @entity1 county			1
" i do n't know if it 's a wall of distrust , " @entity0 said , adding he holds a lot of community support			2
" i have compassion ... i 've worked in @entity86 working with the president			0
i could go on and on , " @entity0 said			2
" but i will tell you one thing : enforcing the law overrides my compassion			0
i took an oath of office and i 'm enforcing the state and federal law			0
" i will continue to enforce all the laws , " he added			0
@entity97 , @entity0 's deputy chief , described the @entity4 's allegations as " a sneak attack by the federal government on the citizens of @entity1			1
" @entity102 and his attorneys declined to comment on the specific allegations , but lawyer @entity105 said : " i think it was a foregone conclusion of what they 're going to find , and they ended up finding it			0
" people have an intention to go out on a witch hunt , and that 's what they come up with , " @entity105 added			0
@entity0 pledged to continue working with the @entity4 in its ongoing investigation			2
during a press conference earlier thursday to discuss the @entity4 letter , assistant attorney general @entity116 told reporters , " we are also reviewing allegations that @entity16 has failed to investigate a large number of sex crimes			1
" the sheriff 's office has acknowledged to federal authorities that 432 cases of sexual assault and child molestation were not properly investigated over a three - year period ending in 2007 , and many of the victims apparently were @entity10 , the @entity4 said			1
last week , @entity0 responded to local media accounts regarding the allegedly mishandled sex crime investigations by telling @entity136 affiliate @entity135 : " if there were any victims out there , i apologize , if there were any			2
" the federal findings also alleged discriminatory policing practices by @entity0 's officers including " unlawful stops , detentions and arrests of @entity10 , " according to a @entity4 statement			1
it also noted that the sheriff 's office has discriminated against " latino inmates with limited @entity151 by punishing them and denying critical services			1
" it further blamed the office for allowing " specialized units to engage in unconstitutional practices " and for a lack of oversight and deputy training			0
@entity116 said the office 's " systematic disregard for basic constitutional protections has created a wall of distrust between the sheriff 's office and large segments of the community			1
" on his government website , @entity0 refers to his renowned nickname and his tough law - and - order posture , which has garnered him international attention : " you probably know him as ' @entity12 's @entity173 , ' a name given to him years ago by the media			2
it 's a name he certainly has earned as head of the nation 's third largest @entity16 which employs over 3400 people			0
but even before he became @entity173 in 1993 , @entity0 was one tough lawman , " his biography states			2
but federal authorities offered a different portrait thursday			0
" in short , @entity16 is broken in a number of critical respects , " @entity116 said			0
" the problems are deeply rooted in ( @entity16 ) culture , and are compounded by ( its ) penchant for retaliation against individuals who speak out , " added @entity116 , who said authorities were also looking at allegations of excessive force and a deliberate failure to provide law enforcement services in select communities			0
the initial federal inquiry began in june 2008 and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents and more than 400 interviews , including current and former inmates as well as office personnel			0
authorities notified the sheriff 's office of a formal investigation a year later , a statement said			1
@entity116 told reporters thursday that the sheriff 's office initially failed to cooperate with investigators , prompting federal authorities to take the " virtually unprecedented step " of filing a lawsuit in 2010			1
he noted the investigation had uncovered startling levels of racial profiling against @entity51 drivers , ranging between four and nine times higher than against @entity221 motorists			0
@entity116 added that an independent reviewer involved in the probe described it as " the most egregious racial profiling in the @entity5 " he had ever seen			0
" it is clear to me that this community is divided and it is time to heal			0
it is time to bring the community together around the shared vision of a department that is effective in reducing crime , respects the rule of law and enjoys the confidence of everyone , " @entity116 told reporters			0
@entity0 has long been considered a hard - liner on illegal immigration in a state known for its tough 2010 law on the issue			0
he 's also a well - known and controversial personality , running for his sixth term as sheriff .			0
