the two men , both former pros and members of the @entity29 national team , are seeking unspecified damages for discrimination , harassment , retaliation and wrongful termination , their attorneys said in a statement wednesday			0

@entity18 " asked everyone who speaks @entity50 raise your hand , and there was a group that could not speak @entity50 , " @entity6 said			1
