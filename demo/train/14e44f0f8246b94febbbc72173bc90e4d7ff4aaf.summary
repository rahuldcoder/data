-- since the time of @entity3 five centuries ago , people have wondered whether there are other planets like @entity6 in the universe			1
today scientists are closer than ever to an answer -- and it appears to be that the @entity12 galaxy is rich in @entity6 - sized planets , according to astronomer @entity14			1
drawing on new findings from a @entity18 telescope , he told the @entity20 conference in @entity21 , @entity22 earlier this month that nearly 150 @entity6 - sized planets have been detected so far			1
he estimated that the overall number of planets in the galaxy with " similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on @entity6 is pretty staggering			1
it 's about 100 million such planets			2
" a @entity34 - born scientist with @entity35 in astronomy and physics , @entity14 is a professor of astronomy and director of the @entity40 , which brings together scientists from many disciplines to explore how life began			1
he titled his talk at the @entity21 conference : " on completing the @entity46			0
" until technology was developed to detect planets outside the solar system 15 years ago , scientists were only able to speculate about the existence of @entity6 - like planets			1
the new technology paid off in the discovery of some 500 planets			2
the disappointing fact though was that very few of the newly identified planets were the size of @entity6			1
" there was of course an explanation for it			0
we only see the big planets			0
so that 's why most of those planets are really in the category of ' like @entity69 , ' " he said			0
read more about @entity14 on @entity20 there was no indication that these large planets were suitable for life to begin			1
" we were still back where @entity3 was			0
we did n't have any evidence whether planets like the @entity6 are out there , " @entity14 said			1
" and we do care about planets like the @entity6 because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate , to emerge , to survive			1
and we did n't have the evidence for that			0
" in march 2009 , @entity18 launched @entity86 , a telescope - carrying satellite that can detect the dimming of light caused by a planet orbiting around a star			0
" all the stars for @entity86 are just points of light , " @entity14 said			1
" but we learn a lot from that , not only that there is a planet there , but we also learn its size			0
how much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is			0
we learn about its orbit , the period of its orbit and so on			0
" the discovery of many potential planets means " we can go and study them -- remotely , of course -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years			0
we can find what they 're made of , would their atmospheres have water , carbon dioxide , methane			0
" at the same time , @entity14 believes , scientists can make progress in the laboratory on better understanding how chemicals can produce life			1
" and in one of our labs , @entity128 's labs , it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments -- which are very common on planets , on certain types of planets like the @entity6 -- where you have some liquid water and some clays , you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles			1
but those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on @entity6			2
and they really help molecules , like nucleic acids , like @entity149 and dna , stay inside , develop , change , divide and do some of the processes that we call life			2
" @entity3 is famous for the then - revolutionary idea that the @entity6 orbits the sun rather than that the universe is centered around @entity6			1
but @entity14 pointed out that with the @entity159 revolution came a humbling sense of mankind 's insignificance in the universe			1
" you 've all learned that in school -- how small the @entity6 is compared to the immense universe			1
and the bigger the telescope , the bigger that universe becomes			0
... so in space , the @entity6 is very small			2
to demonstrate the minuteness of life on @entity6 , @entity14 took off his tie			1
" can you imagine how small it is ? let me try it			0
ok , let 's say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars			2
do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be ? " it will be the size of a single , small atom			2
... but that 's not the whole story , you see			0
" the other dimension of life on @entity6 is time -- and life has existed for a good portion , nearly a third , of the time the universe is believed to have existed , @entity14 said			1
" this is not insignificant			0
so life might be insignificant in size , but it is not insignificant in time			2
life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent , parent and offspring			2
" so what does this tell us ? this tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the @entity159 principle , it 's all wrong			0
there is immense , powerful , potential in life in this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the @entity6 are common			1
and that potential , that powerful potential , is also our potential , of you and me			0
" and if we are to be stewards of our planet earth and its biosphere , we better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it			0
and the good news is we can actually indeed do it			0

@entity14 : @entity6 - sized planets are plentiful in the galaxy
he says planets of such size are suited for the chemical processes that can produce life
@entity14 says *biologists* are finding clues to origin of life in laboratories
he says @entity6 life is notably old , representing nearly a third of age of universe
