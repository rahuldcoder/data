, once wrote of a certain @entity32 metropolis : " one of the most engaging peculiarities of @entity21 is her reverence for her traditions , her relics , her antiquities			1
" he was referring to her massacre , not her ballpark , but i think he really nailed her			0
@entity25 died on april 21 , 1910 , in @entity41 , as good a place to get sick and kick a bucket as any			1
( a great many insurance agents there			0
) two years later , damn near to the day , a new @entity21 place of business opened its gates to the public			1
april 20 , 1912 , turned out to be a big day in that city 's history , even if most of the folks from the @entity2 district 100 years ago were still talking about a big tub in the @entity55 that went down with poor @entity56 and @entity57 on it			1
i am pleased to acknowledge that @entity2 's centennial is upon us			1
i am less pleased to confess that -- at the risk of offending any @entity64 fan who feels as if you have just spat on his or her great - grandfather 's grave -- what i love about @entity2 is , to be perfectly frank with you , nothing			1
if you love it , love every single thing about it , good for you			2
i am very sorry , but not all of us do			0
all right , now here comes the disclaimer where i give you a lot of yada - yada about how much i do like the city of @entity21 itself , the community , the @entity81 , heck , the whole @entity82 , and have never in my life spent a bad hour there			1
i have no grudge against the @entity64 in any way , shape or form			1
i am not a @entity90 guy			0
i have admired the pride of @entity16 folk ever since @entity93 took a high hard one , oh about letter - high			2
i have long liked @entity95 and @entity96 and @entity97 and @entity98 and @entity99 and @entity100 and @entity101 and @entity102 and the @entity103 and the @entity104			0
i even thought for a few years that " @entity107 " was the best show on tv			2
if i belabor this point , it is out of self - preservation			2
@entity111 : a lyric to the little bandbox i am no @entity21 basher by nature and have no desire to be branded as one			1
i was a @entity117 child , but liked the @entity64 just fine			1
the first game @entity119 took me to was @entity120 , and darned if @entity121 did n't wallop a home run			0
so did the pitcher , a guy named @entity124 whom i never laid eyes on thereafter			0
to earn a living ( if you can call it that ) , i got a newspaper job			0
i have been to @entity2 a couple dozen times			1
i saw @entity133 behind the plate and @entity135 in right			0
i interviewed @entity121 's kid , the one who deep - froze him			1
i became a @entity140 voter who did not vote for @entity141			0
i did n't care much for @entity142 , so i did n't much care when that ball went through his legs			0
i was in @entity146 on the 2004 night when the @entity64 took the @entity147 to reverse the @entity149 curse			1
i wrote about @entity150 selling @entity149 to @entity151 for $ 100,000 so he could back a show called " no , no , @entity153			0
" i promptly got a note from @entity155 , saying no , no , that was a big fat lie because his grandfather did no such thing			0
" his theater money went into baseball , " i was told			0
when the park first went up , @entity162 undoubtedly felt like @entity164 must have when a stately pleasure - dome he did decree			2
for 1912 , @entity2 must have been such an architectural marvel , you 'd think @entity170 of " @entity172 " fame designed it			1
i am sure the washrooms had indoor plumbing and everything modern			0
the seats in the grandstand were so large , they could comfortably accommodate men as large as 5 - foot - 5			2
little did they know that come april 20 , 2012 , there would be all kinds of wild changes in the world , like a manned spaceship to the moon , a black man in the @entity189 and a woman maybe even being considered for membership at @entity192			1
i applaud the fact that the cute bandbox at 4 @entity195 , @entity21 , 02215 is now the oldest venue for a professional athletic team in these @entity23			2
it is in the news for turning 100			2
@entity200 and @entity201 will no doubt salute it			0
it is also in the news becase of an outspoken , outlandish , outstanding ( choose one ) opinion expressed by a young fellow by the name of @entity208 , a designated hitter ( one of those post- 1912 things ) for the @entity211 ( ditto ) , who had the temerity to say of @entity2 : " as a baseball player , going there to work , it 's a dump			1
" whoa , did his spit hit the fans			0
you 'd have thought he compared @entity2 to the quake - struck @entity220 nuke plant			1
you know , in a keep - out , run - for - your - lives kind of way			2
i grant you that it did n't help the kid 's popularity any that @entity208 went on to say of @entity2 's fans that " they 're ruthless , they 're vulgar , they cause trouble , they talk about your family , swear at you ... who likes that ? " uh , not me			1
the @entity237 , maybe , but not me			0
i neither adore nor abhor @entity2 , but i believe its time has come and gone			1
i have seen the @entity90 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity117 and others erect fine new ballyards for future generations to enjoy			0
they have done so over the objections of every stubborn cuss who insists that his or her grandkids and great - grandkids must attend the old park just because i did and , oh , i love it so			2
let the kids of april 20 , 2022 , and 2032 and 2102 have a pristine , up - to - the - minute place to watch the @entity64 , a place to create memories of their own			1
yes , yours is a " real " ballpark			0
i enjoyed the scene in " @entity259 " in which the team 's owner takes @entity262 ( @entity263 ) to the park to absorb its beauty			2
it was such a sweet scene in that true story , i almost wish it were true			0
@entity21 's boss interviewed @entity262 at his @entity271 home , not at the park			1
@entity111 : baseball 's oldest venue -- and still its best i have been googling a few interesting observations of late , finding quotes from @entity278 who love the team , love the fans but , yes , may @entity282 forgive them , would love a new park			2
i see the @entity32 junior senator , @entity284 , is taking a teasing about expressing his fondness for @entity2 on its 100th anniversary after having devoted considerable effort at the beginning of this 21st century to having the @entity64 build a new park next door to the @entity291 ' one ' way out in @entity292			1
it was apparently an error on his part , for those of you scoring at home			0
a " dump , " the word the @entity211 boy used , is a tad harsh			0
bright gents like the baseball expert @entity302 and the @entity304 columnist @entity303 have applied that same tag to @entity306 in recent times , absent of malice			0
it is not about dissing the @entity310 or their fans			0
it is about reminding them that the park has crummy plumbing , hungry rats and crumbling concrete			0
it is about ballplayers who must shower , shave and dress in locker rooms about as roomy as a @entity323 's closet			2
" @entity324 " it reads on a sign by a @entity2 doorway , or at least it did the last time i was there			1
it is a matter of opinion , not fact			0
let 's let the @entity64 have the benefit of the doubt and concede that this claim is true			1
let it be blown to bits , then build a bigger , better , more beautiful @entity2 , tall green left - field wall and all			1
i love you , @entity21			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity345 .			2

@entity21 's @entity2 opened 100 years ago today on april 20 , 1912
@entity345 says insulting @entity2 is practically a hate crime in the @entity21 area
@entity345 on @entity2 : " i believe its time has come and gone "
he 'd love to see " a new , pristine , up - to - the - minute place to watch the @entity64 "
