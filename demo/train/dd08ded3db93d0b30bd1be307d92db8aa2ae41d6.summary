-- dieting in @entity1 is not recommended			1
the country 's cuisine is a rich blend of @entity5 , middle - eastern and @entity7 food			2
the @entity9 lend their influence with goose liver pate , while the seven - layer @entity13 cake can rival @entity15 's famed @entity14 for sickly sweet extravagance			1
food here is abundant and affordable -- a nightmare for weight - watchers , a dream for true foodies			0
goulash goulash -- is it a soup ? is it a stew ? @entity1 's national dish ( pronounced " gooyash , " by the way ) is a cross between the two , a steaming bowl of slow - cooked beef , carrots , onions and loads of @entity1 's trademark paprika to give it a good kick			1
it 's hard to find a restaurant that does n't serve it -- from the humblest café to the grandest establishments			2
where to try it : in the sleek , modern surroundings of @entity47 ( @entity49 utca 3 , +36 1 783 0788 )			0
@entity50 the @entity1 ' favorite street food certainly hits the spot on a chilly morning when you 're desperate for a quick bite before lunch			1
it 's simple : a deep - fried flatbread topped with sour cream and grated cheese -- sometimes with a bit of garlic just to annoy the person next to you			1
where to try it : the @entity67 town of @entity68 has some of the best langos in the country			0
there 's tiny alleyway leading to @entity74 church in the main square , where a sign helpfully saying " langos " should point you in the direction of a nameless stall halfway up the alley			2
paprika chicken those sweet red peppers that are such a staple of @entity1 cooking really shine in this popular stew also known as chicken paprikash			1
powdered paprika goes into the dish too , along with onions , garlic , tomatoes and a dollop of sour cream			1
served with egg dumplings called nokedli ( like the @entity15 spätzle ) , it 's comfort food that 's hard to beat			2
where to try it : if you 're in the @entity102 district of @entity47 , try @entity103 ( @entity104 utca 2 , +36 1 356 0851 )			0
@entity106 meat pancakes @entity1 adore their palacsinta -- pancakes that are more like @entity9 crêpes than the thicker @entity111 ones you douse with maple syrup			1
this savory version is just as decadent : a rich stew of minced veal or chicken tucked inside the pancakes and smothered with a sour cream and paprika sauce			1
where to try it : while relaxing under the stone arched ceiling of @entity124 ( @entity125 utca 14 , @entity47 , +36 1 375 6971 ) , housed in a 13th - century former bakery			0
goose liver pâté it 's not just the @entity9 who like goose liver ; the @entity1 are right behind them in their love for this buttery delicacy			1
where to try it : they wrap it in bacon and lightly grill it at @entity140 restaurant in @entity68 ( @entity141 1 ; +36 26 301 479 )			0
or you can have it as a starter at one of @entity47 's landmark restaurants , @entity145 ( @entity147 4 , +36 1 468 4040 ) , in the lush surroundings of the city park			2
cold sour cherry soup while a lot of @entity1 dishes are perfect for cold days , chilled sour cherry soup is just the thing for warm summer evenings			2
fresh sour cherries combine with sour cream and sugar in this refreshing classic			0
where to try it : @entity163 ( @entity162 korut 14 , @entity47 , +36 30 241 7760 ) , for the takeout version			0
@entity166 pike perch @entity167 is @entity1 's playground , where everyone flocks to laze in thermal springs and feast on the lake 's plump pike perch			1
you can have this succulent fish roasted , grilled or prepared @entity166 style : made into a terrine with cream , white wine , spinach and dill			0
where to try it : gorgeous views of the lake come with delicious plates of fish at @entity188 ( @entity189 9 , @entity190 , +36 76 448 575 ) from its prime position on the @entity190 peninsula			0
stuffed cabbage leaves you wo n't go far in @entity194 and @entity5 without coming across cabbage rolls , and @entity1 is no exception			2
here they 're called toltott kaposzta : pork mince stuffed into cabbage leaves with -- you guessed it -- lots of paprika			0
it 's best with sour cream on top , in true @entity1 style , along with sauerkraut and chunks of smoked pork			1
where to try it : after browsing the stalls in @entity47 's @entity213 , you can grab a plate of hearty stuffed cabbage upstairs in @entity216 ( @entity162 korut 1 - 3 , +36 1 217 7860 )			0
@entity217 ( chimney cake ) " @entity217 " is made by wrapping pastry around a cylinder to bake over the last of the embers in an open fire			0
the pastry is also often coated in lots of sugar so the lovely sticky caramel coating can hold on to the extra flavors dusted on top -- anything from cinnamon to cocoa to chopped walnuts			0
where to try it : it 's best slightly warm with ice cream and coffee in @entity239 's @entity238 ( @entity240 31 ) in @entity47			0
@entity13 cake seven layers -- yes , seven -- of moist sponge cake sandwiched with chocolate buttercream			1
then , before things get too gooey , there 's a thin layer of caramel on top to give it a lovely crunch			1
we have 19th - century @entity1 confectioner @entity252 to thank for this heavenly creation which has become a staple in @entity1 coffeehouses			1
where to try it : the sumptuous interior of @entity47 's @entity260 ( @entity261 utca 9 , +36 1 266 2110 ) is a suitably grand setting for such a glorious cake			2
@entity265 torte a cake fit for a prince -- prince @entity265 , to be precise			0
the @entity1 royal 's name lives on in one of @entity5 's most famous cakes : five layers of almond meringue and buttercream with elegant swirls on top			1
where to try it : just around the corner from @entity47 's ornate @entity280 is @entity281 ( @entity282 4 , +36 1 269 3210 ) , a delightfully old - fashioned cake shop where you can indulge in one of these royal treats			2
@entity288 sponge cake not one but three types of sponge cake -- vanilla , chocolate and walnut -- go into this luscious dessert			1
but it does n't stop there : fresh whipped cream , chocolate sauce and pungent rum bring the three cakes together to form an exquisite dessert			0
where to try it : for sheer opulence , this rich dish is best devoured in the fantastic interior of the @entity307 ( @entity308 korut 9 - 11 , +36 1 886 6111 ) in the @entity47 hotel .			0
