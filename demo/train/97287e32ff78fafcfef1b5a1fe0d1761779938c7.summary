@entity0 -- when @entity3 left home in the 1940s to join a teenage girl jazz band called the @entity8 , she had no idea what it would be like , as a white girl , traveling with the predominantly black band			1
at the time , @entity3 said she thought " @entity17 " was a man they were supposed to meet in the @entity16			1
" i did n't realize it was a law , and a very strict law -- laws , plural , " she said			2
state and local ordinances that mandated separate public facilities for blacks and whites made it illegal for @entity3 to share facilities with her band members			1
@entity3 felt the discrimination because she lived on their tour bus with the other girls , hiding her race			1
for three years , she said , they were like her sisters			0
she spent several hours in jail in @entity37 , @entity38 , in 1944 when authorities did n't believe the story she had made up that her father was white and her mother was black			2
" they went though my wallet and there was a picture of my mother and dad right in front of the house , " she said			0
she was sprung a few hours later when the band 's manager brought two black girls to the jail who claimed to be @entity3 's cousins			1
by that time , according to @entity3 , the authorities that were holding her were glad to get rid of her			1
" they just told us never to return			0
and as far as i know , we did n't , " she said			0
the risks were worth it to play her saxophone with what became known as the nation 's first integrated , female jazz band			2
the @entity8 were founded at @entity66 in @entity67 in 1937 , in part as a way for the students to help pay for their education			1
they recruited members of different races to help with the " international " part of their image			1
@entity78 had a @entity80 father , a mixed - race mother , and no visible musical skills when she was recruited to the group as a 15 - year - old			2
she was out on the street playing stickball when they picked her up			0
" the director of the music was named @entity90 , " @entity78 said			0
" they called me ' @entity92 ' because he had to spend more time with me to teach me the beat			0
" the name " rabbit " has stuck to this day			0
in 1941 , the group separated from the school and went professional			0
they traveled on a bus to gigs across the @entity102 , including venues like the @entity104 in @entity105 and the @entity106 in @entity0			1
during @entity107 , the @entity8 traveled to @entity108 and @entity109 as part of a @entity112 tour in 1945			1
pictures and mementos from the @entity8 are on display at the @entity117 's @entity116 for their 10th annual @entity118 in april			1
six members of the band were in @entity0 this week to reminisce			2
" it was a privilege to come from @entity67 and go and see the other parts of the world , " said @entity121 , who played the trombone from the band 's founding until it disbanded			2
" all i ever wanted to do was play a trumpet , " @entity128 told a group gathered at the museum			0
and as for music education today , she feels bad for today 's students			0
" some of our schools in our country now have abolished the music , and it 's not fair , " she said			0
@entity3 told the group that if music is your passion , you need to stick with it			1
" do n't let anyone come between you and your horns , or music , " she added .			0
