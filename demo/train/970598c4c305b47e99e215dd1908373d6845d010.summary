-- forget the immensely powerful car or the wealth of up - to - the - minute gadgets at his disposal , if @entity6 drives to @entity8 glory this season it 'll be thanks to his lucky pants			1
the @entity12 , who drives for the @entity15 team , came agonizingly close to taking his first ever world title in 2008 but was pipped to the post by @entity19 on the final lap of the final race of the season			1
the following year he was lucky to survive after being hit on the head by a stray suspension spring that had flown from a rival 's car during qualifying for the @entity29 @entity28			1
but in 2011 he is hoping for no more obstacles as he guns for the world crown , with the help of his underwear			1
" i have special underwear which i race in most of the time , " he told @entity0			1
" [ i wear them ] just for the saturday and sunday i do n't wash but , two days , what 's the problem ? " @entity6 replied			1
his superstitions do n't end there			2
he always lands on his right foot when he gets out of bed in the morning and makes sure the same foot enters his car first before a race			2
" i think the superstition is just something that is inside your brain , " he explained			2
" for sure , you would win because you have the underwear or because you are happy or whatever			2
" you win because you are doing the best job , but inside your brain it is important to have everything clean and everything ready and that 's why sporting people are superstitious			2
" with some impressive pre-season testing sessions under his belt many pundits are tipping @entity6 to muscle his way into the title reckoning in 2011 , so could this finally be his year ? " yes , i believe in my speed , i believe in the way i drive and i believe i can win many races and the championship			1
i think that 's very important to have inside your brain , to be stronger and stronger all the time			2
" and i know if i have all the possibilities and everything that is automatically for my driving style , for the way i drive i can be there			0
" after persistent problems with his car last season @entity6 thinks the new @entity79 tires to be used in the forthcoming campaign will benefit his racing style			1
" most of the problems i had last year should be alright for this year because the tires are much softer , to get the temperature in the tires it will be easier , so i expect not to have this problem , but we are a little bit early to say that			0
" i like the tires , for sure			0
they 're very different from last year , so maybe we are going to have more pit - stops because otherwise after some laps you are struggling a lot on the tires			0
so it 's a big change for the championship , it 's a big strategy change , but i enjoy it , " he said			0
@entity6 also rejects the oft - repeated notion that if he is to clinch a world title he will have to leave @entity15 in order to do so			1
" i do n't think so , " he said			0
" i think i 'm in a top team , it 's important to have a top car and if i have that i will fight to the maximum level to be the champion			0
" @entity15 is just the top in motorsport , it is a dream car on the road , for sure it is the most important thing			1
when you drive for a team like @entity15 it really is a dream come true			1
" @entity6 showed courage to climb back into a @entity8 car just ten weeks after his life - threatening crash in @entity116 but he insists he never dwells on what might have been			1
" i never dream about the accident , " he said			0
" what is important to say is that it was not my time			0
i believe in @entity122 , i am @entity123 , so i 'm sure it was not my time , it was a not the moment to go to a different life			0
" there 's nothing to say about that			0
when it 's not your time , you know , you stay here			0
