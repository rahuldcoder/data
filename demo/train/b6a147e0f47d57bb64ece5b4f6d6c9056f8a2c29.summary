-- for the first time , a " @entity2 " movie has ruled the box office for three weeks in a row			2
during what was one of the slowest weekends of the year , " @entity2 : breaking @entity9 -- part 1 " held on to first , dropping 60 percent for $ 16.9 million , according to studio estimates			1
that 's a smaller decline than what " @entity2 : @entity14 " experienced during the same weekend two years ago -- it fell 64 percent			1
nevertheless , " breaking @entity9 -- part 1 " is still trailing the past two twilight movies			1
the fourth entry in the romantic supernatural series has so far grossed a stellar $ 247.3 million in 17 days			0
by comparison , " @entity14 " had earned $ 255.4 million by this point , while " @entity2 : @entity21 " had collected $ 255.8 million			0
this will ultimately be a moot point when " breaking @entity9 -- part 2 " comes out next november and likely destroys all of the franchise 's records			1
@entity31 's " the @entity30 " was the runner - up , plunging a sharp 62 percent -- more than any other wide release -- for a weekend tally of $ 11.2 million			1
it 's too early to sound the alarm , especially since the movie has already grossed $ 56.1 million on its $ 45 million budget			2
and " the @entity30 " will likely bounce back with a better hold next week			1
but it is surprising that a @entity39 - rated family film with such endearing reviews and an " a " rating from @entity43 graders would drop so much			2
one possible explanation is that after all the activities and shopping of @entity48 weekend , many families opted to take it easy this week			0
it 's worth noting that such @entity48 releases as 2007â € ²s " @entity52 " and last year 's " tangled " fell 52 percent and 56 percent , respectively , during their sophomore frames			1
but " @entity58 , " " @entity59 , " " @entity60 , " and " @entity61 " all had smaller drops than " the @entity30 , " so there might be something else at play here			1
perhaps the film 's solid $ 29.2 million opening weekend was driven more by nostalgic adults than by family audiences			2
( @entity31 reported that 65 percent of the picture 's audience was over the age of 18			2
) if that 's the case , then those muppety adults all rushed out to see " the @entity30 " last week , thereby leaving the film somewhat front - loaded			1
@entity31 would be wise to release @entity71 out into the world to intimidate encourage more families to see the movie			0
the rest of the top five was occupied by other family films			0
@entity78 's " @entity58 , " a @entity80 love letter to silent cinema , slipped 33 percent for $ 7.6 million			1
the movie 's small decline can be partly attributed to the fact that it added more than 500 theaters this weekend			2
" @entity58 " has so far taken in $ 25.2 million on a budget that 's reportedly at least $ 150 million			1
in fourth place , @entity88 's " @entity59 " declined only 39 percent for $ 7.4 million			2
the well - reviewed holiday comedy should continue to hold up well as we approach @entity91			0
and " @entity60 " rounded out the top five by diving 55 percent for $ 6 million			0
in limited release , the @entity94 dramedy " @entity95 " once again posted impressive numbers , grossing $ 5.2 million from 574 theaters			0
@entity99 will expand the @entity101 hopeful to 850 theaters on friday			0
the silent film " @entity104 " also continued to make some noise with $ 206,000 from six locations			0
and , finally , the nc - 17 drama " @entity110 , " about a @entity109 sex addict ( @entity108 ) , debuted to a superb $ 361,000 at 10 theaters			0
the film may have trouble adding theaters beyond metropolitan areas because of its taboo rating			0
the @entity117 : breaking @entity9 -- part 1 -- $ 16.9 mil 2			1
the @entity30 -- $ 11.2 mil 3			1
@entity58 -- $ 7.6 mil 4			1
@entity59 -- $ 7.4 mil 5			0
@entity60 -- $ 6.0 mil see the full article at @entity0			0
