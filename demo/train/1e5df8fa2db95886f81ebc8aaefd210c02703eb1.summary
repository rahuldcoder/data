@entity0 wore maternity clothes for more than 12 years			1
her weight , which bounced up and down around her four pregnancies , was n't just an aesthetic concern			2
she had frequent asthma attacks , broke an ankle several times , developed rosacea and noticed that her hair had stopped growing			2
" i did n't realize it was affecting my entire family , " @entity0 said			1
once @entity0 got serious about losing weight for good , she , her husband , @entity13 , and daughter @entity14 lost a combined 300 pounds together			1
a big factor in the trio 's transformation was changing how they ate : choosing healthier foods and cooking at home			2
" the weight loss in my opinion is the easy part , " @entity0 said			1
" it 's the maintenance that 's hard , and that 's difficult and takes time and education and understanding			2
" a family health crisis @entity0 had many complications with her pregnancies			1
she was hospitalized for four weeks because of preeclampsia with her first son , @entity36 her third child , @entity37 , almost died as an infant			0
@entity0 suffered badly with asthma and weighed close to 300 pounds when she was pregnant with her youngest child , @entity40			1
her older daughter @entity14 , now 14 , suffered weight problems , too			2
@entity14 remembers going to @entity43 with her mother and wanting to try on clothes in the kids ' section			0
but because of her large size as a third - grader , she had to shop in the adult section			2
it was hard for @entity14 , knowing children were in the other part of the store ; she was surrounded by " all these old women			0
" " @entity14 looks at old pictures of herself and she says , ' why did you let me get so big ? ' " @entity0 said			1
" it probably is my fault			0
i was kind of lost myself			0
" @entity0 tried commercial weight - loss programs , but nothing worked			1
she became serious about getting healthy after an asthma attack in 2005 , a year after @entity40 's birth			1
@entity0 was driving her children home from a friend 's house when she felt a heaviness in her chest			1
she reached for her inhaler , but it was n't in her purse			0
she panicked and pulled over			0
" the only thing i could think of is : ' i 'm going to die here on the street , ' " she said			0
" i called my husband and i told him where i was , because i did n't think i 'd be alive when he got there			0
" her brush with death made her decide once and for all : the weight had to go			2
changing bad habits in those days , @entity0 did n't cook much at all			1
frozen pizza , chicken nuggets in a bag , mac and cheese in a box , a pre-made " family - size portion " of chicken lasagna for herself and her husband -- these were typical meals			1
when the children were little , @entity0 kept a hefty supply of bags of chips , she said			1
" all the neighborhood kids used to come over all the time because i had so much junk food , " she said			0
but in 2006 , @entity0 dedicated herself to understanding healthy food choices			1
now @entity0 avoids anything that comes in a bag or box			1
the family cooks together , making main courses such as chicken wings from scratch and sides such as mashed potatoes mixed with cauliflower			2
every meal has a salad			0
@entity0 's husband has become " a wizard with stir fry , " she said			1
and @entity14 , who used to buy two ice cream snacks at school at lunch , now brings her lunch from home and makes strawberry - banana protein smoothies			2
getting up and moving the family has also been spending less time sitting on the couch			2
@entity14 and @entity37 have been playing tennis for years			0
they 've motivated the rest of the family to play tennis , too , @entity0 said			1
the family also rides bikes around the neighborhood and has gone on outdoor adventures such as white - water rafting and an obstacle course			1
they have joined a family gym , so that everyone is working out at the same time , and have run 5k races together over the past two years			1
@entity139 credits his wife as leading by example in the diet and fitness changes that have transformed the household			0
he lost 80 pounds , which he has kept off for four years , and now weighs about 188 pounds			0
" i remember the first day that she took me over to the gym and put me on an elliptical machine , " he said			0
" that was the beginning of a process			0
" ups and downs it has n't always been easy			0
on @entity155 2008 , @entity13 went to buy his wife a fondue maker and gourmet chocolate from a local chocolatier			0
she had loved the @entity161 fondue restaurant ; he thought with this present , " i was hitting a grand slam home run			0
" i just looked at him and said , ' you 've got to be kidding me , ' " @entity0 said			1
" i was just beside myself			0
he 's just not understanding the efforts that i 'm putting into my weight loss			1
" her fury did n't abate when her husband tossed the chocolate in the garbage			0
she did n't speak to him for a month			0
( " i knew she was going to bring up [ the fondue ] , " he said later )			0
in retrospect , @entity0 sees that until that point her weight - loss efforts had been inconsistent			1
but her husband apologized , telling his wife that he had n't understood where she was coming from -- that she was serious about getting healthy , long term , and about making everyone in the family feel better about themselves			1
" he was afraid that i was going to become a different person i guess , or not as fun as i used to be , " she said			0
" but we found fun in other ways , without eating			2
" inspiring others today , @entity0 weighs 145 pounds , and has become an expert on losing weight			1
she has traveled extensively , speaking about how to make healthy changes , and was the host and co-producer of a reality show in @entity196 called " @entity197			2
" in 2009 , she teamed up with dr. @entity198 -- whose medical practice @entity0 has been coordinating since 1994 -- to offer a medical weight - loss program that targets nutrition and fitness and also incorporates counseling in behavior modification , and medication when necessary			1
from a size 26 , @entity0 has slimmed down to a size 2			1
@entity14 has also made significant progress ; she lost 50 pounds between 2009 and 2011 , and her father said she has been " an inspiration to other children			0
" now in high school , @entity14 knows a lot of girls who complain about their appearances			0
" i honestly ca n't relate to them , because i love the way that i am right now , " she said			0
as for the embattled fondue maker , it 's still in the family 's kitchen , @entity13 said			1
it 's a reminder of an era of overeating that 's melted away			0
