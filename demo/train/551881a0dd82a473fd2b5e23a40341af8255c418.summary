@entity0 -- reactions ranged from gloom - and - doom predictions to celebrations to ho - hum business - as - usual as the @entity7 military changed its rules tuesday to allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly			1
a minute into the new day , at 12:01 a.m. , the old " do n't ask , do n't tell " rule that has been in force since the @entity14 administration was gone			1
in its place was a policy designed to be blind to sexual orientation and one that the @entity20 brass insists will maintain the military in fighting trim , with no negative impact on " military readiness , military effectiveness , unit cohesion and recruiting and retention			1
" defense secretary @entity28 and @entity30 chairman adm. @entity29 told a news conference that the repeal enhanced the integrity of the nation 's fighting forces			1
" they 'll all get up , they 'll all go to work , and they 'll all be able to do that work honestly , and their fellow citizens will be safe , and that 's all that really matters , " @entity29 said			2
some members of the @entity7 military -- many who carefully hid both their identities and sexual orientation for years -- wasted no time in going public			1
that included the man who until now had been known as @entity49			2
@entity49 had been at the forefront of pushing for the repeal , as co-founder and co-director of a group called @entity55 , which bills itself as the @entity56			1
as an active - duty service member , he would only speak to the media under a pseudonym			0
under the new rules , his real identity can be revealed , and he announced at a news conference tuesday that he is 1st lt. @entity63 , an airman serving on a base in @entity65			1
until now , @entity63 said , he had worried every day that he could lose his military career if it became known he was gay			1
" today and every day i can go back into work with that burden lifted off my shoulders and not have to worry about it any more , " he said			0
concerns of a possible hostile reaction from heterosexual colleagues were unfounded , @entity63 said , adding that " no one 's going hurt us when we go back to our units			1
@entity55 published a new edition tuesday called the " @entity79			1
" it was available on some military bases around the world and included photos of 101 active service members openly stating they are gay			1
the @entity55 magazine is also distributed online			0
" now we are stepping forward , to a new day , a new life , " wrote @entity87 staff sgt. @entity86			0
" a life of openness , integrity , of honor			1
at last , our country has accepted us -- not for who we love or how we love but who we are			0
" the magazine said its photo essay on 101 people serving in the military represented just a portion of the approximately 70,000 " currently serving " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender military personnel			1
" today , for the first time in our history , we will welcome the service of any qualified individual who 's willing to put on the uniform of our country , " said sen. @entity105 of @entity106 , a @entity107 credited with corralling support for the repeal			1
sen. @entity115 , @entity116 , called it " a day to celebrate that it does get better , and we are moving toward a more perfect union			0
" @entity63 wrote a book on his experiences titled " our time : breaking the silence of ' @entity124			1
" it had been advertised under his cover identify , but now @entity127 is ready to substitute his real name on the book , he said			0
" the book is really important to me because this ties into people finding out that there are other gay military members out there serving , " @entity63 earlier told @entity1			1
" i remember a book i read when i was in college done by a gay military officer and it gave me courage and i hope this book does the same			1
" he admitted a lot of people will be surprised , including friends and co-workers of his , as well as many thousands of other military personnel who may learn something new about their battle buddies or colleagues			1
" people will be shocked , but at least they are going to be talking about it , " @entity63 said			1
" and talking can bring down barriers			0
" one of the most vocal and active proponents of the change , @entity148 of @entity149 , was discharged from the @entity152 in 2002 under the old policy			1
" i think it is a combination of thoughts and feelings , " @entity148 said in a telephone interview			0
" it 's going to be vindication for people discharged			0
also there is a sense of relief			0
" he looks back at the speeches he gave around the country , sometimes in the face of such opposition that he required police protection , and to the political bargaining sessions			0
" i feel very fortunate to have been one of those in the rooms on @entity175 and in the @entity176 and with senior administration staff , " @entity148 said			0
@entity178 finally voted in the repeal of the law last december and president @entity181 signed the legislation just before @entity183			1
@entity28 said tuesday that more than 97 % of the nation 's 2.3 million uniformed service personnel had been trained for the end of " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" one of the most prominent congressional supporters of the change , @entity188 chairman @entity187 , said that from now on , thousands of @entity7 will be able to serve their country without concealing part of their identity			2
" they will no longer have to lie in order to help protect us , " @entity187 said in a statement released by his staff			0
" the end of ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' is an important victory not just for equality , but integrity			2
" but a longtime opponent of the change , @entity203 of the @entity204 , said she was concerned that allowing gays and lesbians to serve would drive many loyal troops out of the military			1
" due to the president 's political promises , the military faces heavy burdens of confusion and tension that could have been avoided , " @entity203 said			2
" this is nothing for the administration to be proud of			0
" she said it may be years before the damage to the military is apparent , as some people delay their departure because of a weak economy			2
it would not be wise to consider recruiting , retention and morale to be assured indefinitely , @entity203 said			0
@entity149 said today that 14,346 people were discharged under the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			2
some of the people who were forced out under the old policy are now reapplying , as the new rules reopen a door that had been shut			2
@entity234 was an air force officer for 13 years and helped control the air space over @entity236 during some of the fiercest fighting of the war			2
" my hope is to get back in			0
i 've talked to recruiters			0
i 'm starting to look at that process , " @entity234 said			0
he says that nothing is going to repair the damage to his career , after a five - year gap			0
" i 'm hoping that i can at least get back in there where i left off and resume my career -- hopefully , just be a role model , " @entity234 said			0
" because that 's what we need right now ; we need gay and lesbian role models , officers and enlisted alike , who can serve honestly and openly next to their straight counterparts and show no detriment to the mission whatsoever			2
" @entity149 's @entity148 predicts smooth sailing for all sides in the coming weeks and months			2
" i think the real story is going to be the non-story , " @entity148 said			0
" what this is going to do is normalize everything that is already there			0
" @entity1 's @entity267 contributed to this report .			0
