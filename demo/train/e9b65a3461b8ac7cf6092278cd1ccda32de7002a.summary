-- a new peace conference aimed at ending @entity3 's civil war convenes wednesday in @entity4 , where the international community hopes to apply a tourniquet to the @entity8 's worst open wound			1
here 's a quick thumbnail guide to the conference : what 's at stake in @entity13 ? ending a war that has killed more than 100,000 people , spread to @entity3 's neighbors and become an increasingly sectarian proxy battle among regional powers			1
nearly three years since the beginning of the uprising against @entity3 president @entity21 , the war has fueled new rounds of violence in neighboring @entity24 and @entity25			1
in @entity3 itself , secular and @entity27 rebel factions are battling each other in the country 's north			1
what are the prospects for a deal ? under the circumstances , few appear to expect much to come out of the talks			0
" we have little hope that the @entity21 regime would come with good will to these negotiations , " coalition spokesman @entity38 told @entity0			2
@entity47 's government " is not interested in a political solution , and they will continue to kill the @entity3 people			1
" the relief group @entity48 urged the parties to at least agree on steps to help the youngest victims of the conflict -- allowing aid to reach children , protecting schools and health facilities and stopping the use of explosives in populated areas			0
@entity48 says 11,000 children have died and another 4 million are in danger			0
" even if they ca n't agree on the big picture , surely they can agree on this one fundamental thing , which is that children should not be targeted in war , " said @entity62 , the group 's humanitarian policy director			2
@entity8 expert @entity70 told @entity0 that he expected limited results from the talks			0
" it may have a very small incremental gain , step by step -- humanitarian issues , refugee issues , something else , " @entity70 said			0
but he added , " it is worth being there to test it out			0
" have n't we been here before ? sort of , yes			0
this is the second @entity13 conference on the @entity3 war , the first having been held in mid- 2012			2
what 's now called " @entity87 " in diplomatic shorthand did n't end the war , but it produced a framework for a settlement that calls for the establishment of a transitional government and eventually , free and fair elections under a new constitution			1
who 's coming this time ? along with the @entity3 government , those invited include the five permanent members of the @entity98 -- @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , the @entity102 and @entity103 , @entity3 's biggest backer -- and more than 25 other countries			1
representatives of the @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity109 are coming as well			0
the leading @entity3 opposition movement , the @entity110 , agreed to attend only saturday in a vote that exposed deep rifts within its ranks			2
one of the groups under the coalition umbrella blasted it for agreeing to join the talks at all , accusing it of heading to @entity13 with " a folder of concessions and withdrawals			0
" the late addition of @entity123 to the guest list created a new hurdle monday , since the @entity126 had n't agreed to a set of goals laid out in 2012			0
the @entity110 called @entity123 's participation a " deal - breaker " and threatened to leave the talks			2
the @entity102 urged @entity98 @entity131 ban ki - moon to withdraw the invitation unless @entity123 signed onto the @entity134 goals			2
@entity123 eventually announced that it would not agree to any preconditions for the conference , and the @entity137 rescinded its invitation monday evening			0
what 's on the agenda ? the talks are expected to focus on the @entity134 plan for a transitional government , @entity102 secretary of state @entity141 said last week			1
but @entity21 , whose forces have regained momentum against a now - fractured opposition , has said he 's not looking at the talks as a way to transition out of power			1
@entity3 officials have talked instead about the conference as a way to arrange a cease - fire in @entity3 's largest city , @entity156 , with hopes of extending that truce to other parts of the country			1
over the weekend , @entity21 told the @entity100 news agency @entity161 that the conference should focus on fighting " terrorists " -- his government 's usual description of rebel forces -- and the outside powers he said provide them " political cover			1
" " any political solution that is reached without fighting terrorism has no value			0
there can be no political action when there is terrorism everywhere , " he said			0
then what 's the point ? former @entity99 prime minister @entity179 told @entity0 the conference could offer " at least a pathway " to bring an end to the killing in @entity3			1
" it is essential , however difficult and however challenging , that people try to come together and try to set out at least some broad principles for a framework that allows us to move from here , " @entity179 said in an interview that aired tuesday on @entity0 's @entity185			0
how did this all start again ? protests against @entity21 , who took power after his father died in 2000 , began in march 2011			1
in the wake of the " @entity202 " revolts around the @entity8 and @entity201 , residents of the southern city of @entity198 turned out to criticize the government 's treatment of 15 children arrested for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of a school			1
@entity3 authorities responded by opening fire , killing dozens			1
demonstrations spread to other cities , mass arrests unfolded and tales of torture spread across the country			0
while @entity21 tried to dismiss the protests at first , his government soon was dispatching police and troops to put down what had become a full - fledged revolt against his rule			1
the war has drawn in @entity3 allies @entity123 and the @entity24 @entity229 militia @entity228 ; a variety of @entity232 jihadist groups , who have battled government troops and other rebel factions ; and @entity123 rivals across the @entity237 like @entity238 and @entity239 , which are believed to be providing arms to rebel forces			2
by 2013 , the @entity137 estimated more than 100,000 had been killed			0
large portions of @entity3 cities have been left in ruins , more than 4 million have been left homeless inside the country and nearly 2 million have fled @entity3 altogether , @entity98 officials say			2
@entity0 's @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report .			0

what 's at stake ? ending a *bloodbath* in @entity3 and *capping* a spread of violence to neighbors
what 's on the agenda ? a cease - fire and establishing a transitional government
what 's the outlook ? it 's poor ; president @entity21 intends to cling to power
