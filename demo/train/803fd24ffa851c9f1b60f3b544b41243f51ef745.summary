-- after the september 11 attacks , a @entity2 firefighter took a series of photographs capturing the destruction			2
eleven years later , @entity7 damaged the photographs as they sat in the basement of his @entity10 home			1
partially destroyed , the photographs encapsulate two traumatic events burned in the minds of @entity2			2
the firefighter , @entity13 , now has his photos on display in an installation called " @entity17 " in @entity18			1
@entity13 , a 15 - year veteran of the city fire department , was off duty september 11 , 2001 , and was called in that afternoon			2
one of hundreds of emergency responders , he was stunned by what he found upon arriving at ground zero			1
" it was like a nuclear winter			2
everything was covered with fine white dust			0
it looked like a black - and - white photograph , " @entity13 said			0
@entity13 had brought his camera , and recognizing the magnitude of the attacks , he began snapping shots of the wreckage			0
" i was just trying to convey the scale , which is almost impossible to do , " he said			0
having studied photography , some images jumped out at @entity39 over the months he spent at ground zero			1
he was most struck by the efforts of police officers , firemen , iron workers and crane operators , he said			0
@entity13 developed some of the photos and stored the negatives in a box in the basement of his home in the @entity53 section of @entity10			1
@entity13 initially considered showing the photographs for the 10th anniversary of 9/11			2
but a decade later , he just was n't ready			0
last year , when @entity7 slammed into the @entity56 , @entity13 's home , including the basement housing his 9/11 pictures , suffered extensive flood damage			1
@entity13 likened it to losing family photos			2
a family member later scanned the negatives and gave them to @entity13 as a gift			1
they were altered but not ruined			0
" it was almost like a whole other layer , destruction on destruction			0
the new images were haunting in their own respect , " @entity13 said the @entity73 ' @entity72 curated the show with the @entity75 , an exhibition space			1
the show is on display at @entity18 's @entity79 through tuesday , the anniversary of @entity7 hitting @entity2 , described the photographs as " arresting			1
" the outdoor exhibit is situated between two buildings and features more than 100 of @entity13 's images projected onto two large screens in 15 - minute increments			1
one image shows piles of rubble and collapsed iron , and @entity7 's murky floodwater added what appear to be superimposed black clouds			1
another photo of a firefighter standing , back to the camera , before the @entity99 rubble at ground zero has scratches and water damage that give the picture a smoky , three - dimensional feel			1
on sunday , passersby stopped to take a look , some briefly , while others sat for longer spells , mesmerized as they were reminded of the tragedies			0
" it is very powerful			0
the juxtaposition of the two gets really interesting , " said a neighborhood woman			0
said another man who walked cautiously toward the projections , " it brings up bad memories			0
