-- the saber - rattling between @entity2 and @entity3 conjures fears of mass casualties and a nuclear arms race in the @entity7			1
@entity3 has threatened to attack @entity2 to stop it from obtaining nuclear weapons			1
@entity2 says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and has threatened to strike first against enemies who threaten its national interests			0
the tough talk makes it easy to forget that @entity3 and @entity2 have not always been enemies			1
the @entity17 of @entity3 and @entity18 of @entity2 have had a rich and nuanced relationship dating back thousands of years			1
they have enjoyed an " overwhelmingly positive connection " for centuries , said @entity22 , president of the @entity23 and author of " @entity25 : the @entity26 of @entity3 , @entity2 , and the @entity27			1
" in fact , @entity3 @entity17 grow up reading a @entity30 story about the @entity18 leader @entity31 , who is said to have liberated @entity17 and allowed them to return from exile to rebuild the temple in @entity34 , said @entity35 , an @entity3 expert on @entity3 - @entity2 relations			1
" in the back of the historical memory of the @entity3 , when you speak about @entity2 , @entity2 is considered to be a good friend of @entity3 , " he said			1
after the birth of the nation of @entity3 in 1948 , the countries enjoyed a " honeymoon " that lasted until just before the 1979 @entity46 revolution , said @entity35 , professor emeritus of @entity47 and president of the @entity49 in the @entity3 city of @entity51			0
before the revolution , when the shah - led monarchy governed @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity2 shared a @entity56 bent			1
they cooperated overtly and covertly on economic , political and security issues			0
@entity3 viewed @entity2 as part of its strategy to develop ties with @entity63 states on the region 's periphery , such as @entity66 and @entity67			1
it also saw @entity2 as an important way station for @entity17 fleeing persecution in @entity70 , said @entity71 , a professor at @entity72			0
@entity3 's ties with @entity2 were chiefly motivated by " a single word with three letters -- @entity77 , " he said			1
@entity2 earned money selling oil to the jewish state			0
the shah also saw in @entity3 another pro-american ally with influence in the @entity27			0
" under the shah , @entity3 - @entity2 ties were multilayered and complex , " said @entity84 , a @entity7 expert at the @entity85 in @entity86			1
" the shah had a similar interest in building strategic ties with a growing military power that had a record of defeating @entity97 armies , though he was careful not to publicly embrace @entity3 too warmly , " @entity90 said			1
it was " a love affair without marriage , " @entity35 said , quoting an @entity2 diplomat			0
" you do n't need to have a formal contract to have a happy marriage			0
" even though @entity2 never formally recognized @entity3 , @entity3 operated a permanent delegation in @entity2 until the overthrow of the shah in 1979			1
that event ushered in an @entity46 republic led by the @entity109 and marked a turning point in ties between @entity3 and @entity2			1
the @entity46 republic , led by @entity114 clerics in the predominantly @entity114 nation , saw @entity3 as an illegitimate state with no right to exist , certainly not amid @entity46 nations			0
despite harsh rhetoric , though , @entity109 " did n't want to get into a confrontation with @entity3 , " said @entity119 , a professor of @entity2 and @entity7 history at @entity121 of the @entity122			1
one reason relations were n't worse in the 1980s : @entity3 and @entity2 had a common enemy in @entity70 , a country that fought an eight - year war with @entity2			1
@entity3 even supplied weapons to @entity2 to help it fight @entity70 , @entity119 and other analysts say			1
and @entity3 warplanes bombed a nuclear reactor in @entity70 in 1981 , an act seen as beneficial to both @entity3 and @entity2			1
even as " @entity109 called @entity3 a ' cancerous tumor , ' the @entity3 lobbied @entity86 to boost @entity2 's defenses and bring @entity136 ' back into the @entity138 fold , ' " @entity22 said			2
in the years after the @entity139 , however , @entity3 began to regard @entity2 and its support of global terror as a chief threat			2
the @entity46 republic supported anti-israeli movements such as @entity145 in @entity146 and @entity147 in @entity148 -- groups that @entity3 and the @entity27 classify as terrorist organizations			1
@entity2 also stirred anxiety in @entity3 by revving up its nuclear program			2
@entity2 harbored ambitions to lead the @entity46 world in the fight to liberate @entity156 and wrest @entity34 , one of @entity46 's holy cities and @entity160 's holiest city , from @entity3 , said @entity161 , the author of the " @entity162			2
" yet @entity2 maintained a pragmatic instinct , said @entity22 , who cited a 2003 @entity2 idea to lower the political temperatures and stave off @entity2 's isolation			0
" much like @entity167 , @entity2 would be an @entity46 state that did not formally recognize @entity3 and would occasionally criticize @entity3 policies , but would refrain from directly confronting @entity3			2
@entity2 would get out of @entity3 's hair in return for an end to @entity3 pressure on the @entity27 to isolate and contain @entity2 , " @entity22 said			2
the concept did n't get off the ground			0
after he was elected in 2005 , @entity2 president @entity175 began spouting anti-israeli and @entity178 rhetoric			0
he enraged @entity17 by denying the holocaust and alarmed them with virulent attacks on @entity3			0
his rhetoric stoked fears in @entity3 and elsewhere that a major world leader would want to destroy the jewish state			0
yet it has been @entity2 's nuclear program that has raised the prospects of armed conflict			0
@entity3 prime minister @entity188 has said @entity3 will act to prevent @entity2 from obtaining nuclear weapons			2
@entity27 president @entity190 pledged support for @entity3 this week but also urged more time for diplomacy and harsh sanctions to have an effect			0
as the possibility looms of an @entity3 military strike on @entity2 nuclear sites , the two countries appear to already be engaged in what many have called a shadow war			2
after @entity2 nuclear scientists were assassinated in @entity136 , @entity2 blamed @entity3			2
when attackers targeted @entity3 diplomats this year in @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 , @entity3 blamed @entity2			2
underneath the political tensions , though , some measure of goodwill persists for some			0
" despite three decades of animosity , tens of thousands of @entity2 jews in the @entity27 and @entity3 still have a strong cultural attachment to @entity2 , " said @entity90 , the @entity7 expert in @entity86			2
many @entity2 jews maintain contact with friends and relatives who are among the roughly 20,000 @entity17 in @entity2 , @entity90 said , and @entity3 radio beams programming in @entity220 inside @entity2			0
connections between the two peoples are underscored by the @entity17 holiday of @entity224 , which began wednesday night			0
it commemorates a @entity30 story in which @entity227 , an adviser to the @entity18 king , plots unsuccessfully to kill @entity17 , the story resonates with @entity3 worried about the @entity2 president			1
many of them compare him to a figure far worse than @entity227			0
" they speak about him as @entity236 , " @entity35 said .			0

@entity3 *fondly* think about @entity31 , the ancient @entity18 king
during the rule of the shah , @entity3 and @entity2 forged " multilayered " ties
in the 1980s , @entity3 and @entity2 had a common enemy in @entity245
@entity2 now backs @entity147 and @entity145 , two anti-israel movements
