-- what is the value and impact of international aid ? in an era of global austerity , this is a question that is frequently posed by policymakers and the citizens they represent			1
the truth is , it is actually quite hard to measure			1
but there are important questions about both the quantity and quality of aid that must be answered			2
contrary to popular perception , aid is not one homogenous entity or a single transfer of money from donor to recipient countries			1
the term " international aid " actually covers a wide variety of things , including food and commodities , advice and training , and debt relief			1
in 2011 -- the last year we have comprehensive data for -- total development aid from rich countries stood at nearly $ 150 billion , according to the investments to end poverty report			1
only $ 59 billion identifiably involves the transfer of actual cash to , for example , recipient governments , @entity44 operating on the ground or special project funds			0
aid in kind makes up another $ 25 billion			2
most of this is food aid , which is used to tackle acute hunger -- but even this form of aid is not without controversy			2
many donors avoid shipping actual food to developing countries , aware that it destroys local markets and harms local farmers			2
research demonstrates that food aid can be poor value for money , especially when food grown in donor countries is shipped to the developing world			1
sorghum shipped from the @entity70 is 200 % more expensive than it is in @entity71 and almost 100 % more than in @entity72 , according to @entity74 calculations			0
despite this , the @entity70 and @entity75 continue to make extensive use of food shipments			0
perhaps even more surprising is the fact that large amounts of aid money never actually leave rich countries			1
as much as $ 22 billion -- or 20 % of bilateral aid spending -- is spent on activities in donor countries or put towards the cancellation of debt			1
this includes funds to cover housing , food and other services for the first 12 months of refugees ' stay in the donor country			0
it also includes public spending on universities to cover the costs for students from developing countries			2
in 2011 , $ 4.5 billion was spent on refugee costs , $ 3.5 billion on university costs and around $ 7.5 billion on debt relief			0
as important as these expenditures may be , they do not result in any transfer of resources to developing nations			0
these schemes may of course be beneficial to recipient countries in the long term -- for example , contributing to capacity development if students return to their countries			2
but it is undeniable that these schemes are at odds with the common perception of aid as financial support transferred from donor to recipient countries to fight poverty			1
these different elements of aid obviously have very different effects on economic development and growth			2
a dollar of cash will have a very different impact to a dollar 's worth of food or a dollar 's worth of a consultant 's time			0
it is difficult to understand just how bundling all of these items into one lump sum can allow us to draw meaningful and reliable conclusions about the value of aid			0
this lack of clarity was part of the motivation for investments to @entity154 -- a major new report that analyzes aid in all of its complexity			0
at @entity74 we reviewed each individual record of foreign aid from @entity162 donors over the period 2006 - 2011 -- over a million rows of data			0
now , for the first time ever , we can see just how much aid flows between specific countries and , crucially , what that aid consists of			1
for example , according to our calculations , @entity171 and @entity172 both gave very similar levels of bilateral aid , just above $ 2 billion , in 2011			0
but almost 70 % of @entity171 's aid stayed in the country , spent on refugee costs and debt relief , whereas around 70 % of @entity172 's aid resulted in a transfer of resources to developing countries			2
on the recipient side , some countries that appear to receive considerable funds in fact receive a lot less than advertised			0
our research found that of the $ 7.5 billion in aid reported as given to the @entity192 in 2011 , more than $ 5 billion was not transferred to that country , and consisted instead of debt relief			0
all of this matters because we are at a crossroads in international development			0
in the last few decades , we have seen unprecedented progress in alleviating poverty , as recognised by world leaders meeting at the @entity201 in @entity202 in september			0
there is a growing consensus that we can end extreme poverty by 2030			1
the truth is that we can not meet this goal without international aid			1
while @entity210 and remittances undoubtedly contribute to economic growth in developing countries , aid is the only international resource flow which can be targeted explicitly to improve the lives of the poorest people around the world			1
in @entity219 alone , 400 million people live in extreme poverty and require interventions that are targeted and complementary to existing support to lift them out of it			1
without the support of international aid , most poor people will be left behind			1
if we want to maximize the impact and reach of international aid , we need to ensure that every dollar is spent as efficiently as possible			1
we can only do this with better information and a clear understanding			0
then policymakers in both donor and recipient countries can make better and more informed decisions , and civil society can better monitor progress and hold them to account			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

impact of international aid is hard to measure , says @entity244
large amounts of aid money never actually leave rich countries , he adds
but extreme poverty can not be ended without international aid
