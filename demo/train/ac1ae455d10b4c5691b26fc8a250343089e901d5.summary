he ca n't even walk yet but @entity1 took a momentous step on monday in what 's set to be a lifetime of royal duties			1
when he arrived in @entity6 , @entity7 , he was carried off the plane by his ever - glamorous mother and greeted by a long a line of dignitaries , including prime minister @entity12			1
this was @entity1 's first official public engagement and he was n't in the slightest bit fazed by it , despite the epic journey from @entity17			1
he was perfectly happy , a natural			0
this is a family not just born into monarchy , but made for it			0
and if things carry on like this for the rest of their visit @entity28 , the @entity22 movements in both @entity7 and @entity23 may have some catching up to do			1
i was huddled on the runway in a nest of royal photographers who had traveled half way around the world to secure a picture that will be guaranteed a place in history			2
the weather was dreadful -- windy , wet and cold			1
brits are used to that of course , so it was n't a problem for anyone apart from the photographers who were struggling to prevent history being blurred by the condensation on their lenses			2
opinion : @entity7 prepares to go ga - ga over blue - blooded baby in the background i spotted @entity1 's new nanny , @entity53 - born @entity52 , in what was her first official appearance as well			1
it must have been a moment of reality for her about what she has taken on			0
the dresser was struggling to juggle hat boxes and dresses in the wind , and there was the hairdresser and eight other members of the royal entourage who are accompanying sizable support teams in each location on the trip			1
the ground teams have been organizing logistics , not just for public events but also behind the scenes			0
a royal source told me they have been speaking to the local authorities about " all aspects of the tour , which you 'll imagine includes the requirements for @entity1 and how to accommodate a baby on a royal tour			1
" as an experienced baby - traveler , i would assume that means everything from cots to nappies to those all - important blackout curtains			0
there 's also the car seat of course , and that 's been a big talking point here			0
it was fitted by @entity7 's national childcare advisory , @entity100			2
the problem is , they fitted a forward - facing one when their guidelines tell parents to use rear - facing seats until the age of two			0
the fact it 's even a talking point illustrates the level of public interest there is in the trip			0
this may be a lot of fuss about a baby , and he has no idea what 's going on			0
but when he does realize , @entity1 will look back at these pictures and know that this is where it all officially began .			2
