@entity0 moves down an alleyway toward her home in @entity3 , an ordinary village in eastern @entity6 's @entity5 province , with an extraordinary problem			1
@entity0 slides open the doors with a quick thrust			2
but before she says a word , she begins to cry and points at two identically framed photos @entity12 on her wall			2
they show an older and younger man			2
they look like blown up passport pictures or perhaps faded formal portraits			2
" i do n't want to stay in this house			2
i do n't want to sleep here at night , " she says			2
" my husband was the pillar of the family and when he died it was like the pillar of our house collapsing			2
then my son was taken too			2
" taken 10 years apart by cancer			1
the sound of crying draws villagers to @entity0 's small courtyard			2
they have stories of their own			2
promised riches they say @entity40 was once famed for wooded hills and fertile soil			0
government officials came in the 1990s and promised riches			0
" all the local officials did was fill their pockets with money , " says an older woman angrily			1
during this period , a number of textile companies moved into @entity3 , building their plants across town			1
" all these factories should be moved , because they have caused the cancer , " says one man , as others nod			1
" all of these factories should be removed from here			1
" they tell us that @entity40 is now a " cancer village			1
" can china breathe life into ' ghost towns ' ? rural exposure the term surfaced a few years ago , when trailblazing @entity6 journalists and activists like @entity68 unearthed evidence of unnaturally high rates of cancer across @entity6 , mostly in rural areas dominated by industry			1
@entity68 , who was working for a @entity75 based magazine at the time , focused on the impact of water pollution in rural @entity6			1
" since water is so important to people , the pollution has a more significant impact on people 's health , " he says			1
" @entity6 is suffering from the negative impact of improper economic growth patterns			1
and the country will continue to pay the price for heavy pollutants in the future			0
" this year , facing public pressure , the government admitted that cancer villages exist			1
" @entity6 has been producing and utilizing toxic chemical products			1
many places experienced a drinking water crisis and pollution caused serious social issues like the emergence of cancer villages , " stated a document published in the wake of the cancer villages revelation			1
@entity68 calls it a ' very significant step			0
" " only by acknowledging the problem can we put real efforts in dealing with this issue " he says			0
but for activists like @entity112 in @entity113 , the acknowledgment is n't enough			1
she rolls out a fraying map on her living room floor			0
on her hands and knees , she places photos on different parts of map			0
" look at all these dead fish on the shore , " she says , " and here , the canal turned red			0
" @entity112 has charted the build up of toxic pollution for decades			1
in 2002 she had her own cancer scare , she says , when a tumor was removed			1
it was benign , she says			0
she has complained , petitioned , and become a thorn in the local government 's side			1
she says she has been harassed and threatened for her activism			0
even on the day of our interview , what we believe is a state security officer took surreptitious photographs of us talking			0
she said they came to ask questions when we left			0
she takes us on a walking tour past dyeing factories , textile mills , and weaving plants			1
" this factory just took ' chemical ' off their name when we complained , " she says			0
" we picketed outside this one recently			0
" security guards look nervously through the gate			0
" they know me well , " she says			0
" all i wish for is to breathe clean air , drink safe water and use uncontaminated soil			2
that 's all i ask for , but i guess that is just too much to ask			0
" accountability @entity112 is convinced that that individual plants caused the cancer , but all of the factories dump their water , treated or not , into the same rivers , so it 's nearly impossible to sort the polluters from the non-polluters			1
@entity167 calls the lack of accountability " the perfect smokescreen			1
" in a recent study called " toxic threads , " they contracted scientists to test water in the region and say they found at least a dozen toxic chemicals			1
an official with the local government in charge of @entity40 , who did not wish to be named , told us , " we are aware of the situation and we have been trying our best to combat the problems			2
" they did not give any details of those plans			0
@entity5 province is the center of @entity6 's textile industry , the largest in the world			1
one way or another , this region services the majority of the world 's famous clothing brands			0
@entity167 has called for full transparency between suppliers and brands			1
they want factories to clean up their act or close			2
but the relationship with industry here is more complex			0
in the past 50 years this region has gone from subsistence farming to heavy industry			0
" we complain and petition , but it is pointless , ordinary people can never fight officials and win , " a farmer tells us near @entity216			0
so , like many others here , he works in a dyeing mill at night			0
he says it 's a dilemma that they have to learn to live with			0
high price it may be the contradiction of @entity6 growth , but for @entity226 it is far simpler			1
she says that that industrial expansion in @entity3 village has come at too high a price			1
she says there is no way she can be sure , but she is convinced that the factories caused the cancer of her husband and son			1
she hopes that the government moves her from her empty house			0
" no one from the government ever bothered to come and see me or check on me			0
" " i am so sad			0
i have no more tears to shed , " she says .			0
