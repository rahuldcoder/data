-- the publication this week of memoirs by @entity4 has stirred up a sharp controversy in the press , but as so often happens these days in @entity7 , the focus seems to be on the sensational rather than the important			1
and that leads to the larger argument : whether @entity4 , @entity10 et. al			1
should have published these books may be controversial , but it is a sideshow compared to what 's really important -- and that 's what they have to say about the making and execution of @entity20 foreign policy these days			2
@entity22 aides and allies of the president were naturally upset to read some of the stinging comments by the former defense secretary and @entity28 director about the inner workings of the @entity31 administration			1
overlooking the fact that @entity4 was also generous in his praise about the president , they set out to slime him			1
how dare he criticize @entity31 while still in office , they asked			1
his book was " dishonorable " and " sad , " proclaimed a former @entity22 spokesman on @entity0			1
he willfully misrepresented the past , complained another			0
the press likes nothing better than a food fight among top officials , so naturally enough , they weighed in on whether @entity4 -- and other @entity31 heavyweights like former defense secretary @entity10 , who had also written searching memoirs , had done wrong			1
one can argue the merits of " kiss and tell " books till the cows come home			0
for decades , they were widely seen as verboten			0
when i came to @entity7 in the late ' 60s , the standard was that one should wait a " discreet interval " before writing an inside story			1
as columnist @entity58 pointed out in the @entity59 this week , @entity57 waited nearly 20 years to write his splendid account of the @entity61 years , " present at the creation			0
" but those standards broke down during the @entity64 years as @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and others -- angry with their boss and in need of cash -- wrote shocking inside looks at his tortured presidency			2
@entity74 and @entity75 soon persuaded a slew of other @entity64 aides to spill their guts , creating a whole new genre of quickie , insider books			2
within a few years , it became standard practice for @entity22 aides to sit down regularly with @entity74 to make sure their side of the story got out			2
it 's hard to see why it is so much worse to write memoirs about your governmental years and publicly put your name on them -- as @entity4 and @entity10 have done -- than to anonymously give @entity74 , @entity93 or other authors inside documents and self - serving , behind - the - scenes accounts of your days in @entity97			1
at least @entity4 and @entity10 have had the guts to stand up and be counted			2
two other points should be made about the propriety of these books from the @entity31 era : the people who have written the most searching books about his national security policies -- @entity4 , @entity10 , @entity107 , and @entity108 -- did n't come into this administration as neophytes searching for the brass ring			1
each of them had already won distinction for their years of public service			0
@entity4 and @entity10 had purposefully moved far away from @entity7 and wanted to stay away			1
they had to be persuaded to serve this time -- and they did so mostly out of love of country			0
( as defense secretary , @entity4 frequently flew to @entity121 for weekends just so he could be home again			2
) even if their books have had some sharp things to say , they thus deserve a reasoned hearing on the substance -- not a flaying by people half their stature and with half their experience			0
( by the way , have you heard any @entity22 aides thank @entity4 lately for serving as the chief mastermind in the search for @entity138 ? ) the other point is that these recent books are about our conduct during wars that are hardly our shining hours			1
democrats in particular should remember @entity145 , a hero of the @entity146 but a goat of @entity148			0
for years after he resigned as defense chief to president @entity150 , @entity145 was castigated because he kept his silence when he left			0
i well remember instances when parents of slain @entity20 veterans screamed at @entity145 that he should have gone public with an account of how and why @entity148 went so badly wrong inside the @entity150 administration			0
there is surely something to be said for @entity20 understanding today just how we have handled -- and mishandled -- violence in the @entity162 since 9/11			0
who better to tell us than the men and women who were there at the top ? running through all these books is a common set of concerns about trends that started before @entity31 but have reached new peaks during his presidency : -- to a person , these authors -- and others who served with them at the @entity178 , the @entity179 , the @entity180 , the @entity28 and elsewhere among national security agencies -- believe that power has become entirely too centralized in the @entity22			1
the @entity185 staff is now dangerously swollen : as @entity187 editor @entity186 reminds us , @entity31 has increased @entity185 staff to well over 300 people , doubling its size since @entity193 and capping off a tenfold increase since the 1970s			1
inevitably , the professionals at the @entity185 , with proximity to the @entity197 , want to run things			0
they ca n't : history has proven time and again that once a president makes a decision , the @entity22 should continue to monitor closely but must leave most of the execution to the professionals in the departments			1
-- excessive centralization has also meant that too often , the men and women who run the departments feel marginalized			0
not only do they feel two steps removed from the president , but foreign counterparts have little reason to engage with them when real power rests in the @entity22			1
former officials also say the @entity22 acts as a " choke point , " limiting diverse opinions and slowing down decisive implementation			2
-- perhaps most perniciously , the authors of these books believe that too often the advice of the president 's inner circle has been heavily colored by political considerations , overriding substantive arguments			0
politics , of course , plays a role in all presidential decision - making , but traditionally , policy advisers exercise the biggest voice on the big national security calls			1
there will be time enough after president @entity31 leaves office for historians -- along with @entity74 and others -- to weigh the evidence and reach more studied conclusions about how wisely he and his @entity22 team ran national security			1
but there is real value today in hearing from some of the most respected men and women in national security offering assessments -- pro and con -- about how things are run			0
president @entity31 , writes @entity251 of the @entity252 , is considering some serious personnel changes for his last two years in office			2
he has already appointed a highly regarded retired general , @entity255 , to oversee the campaign against @entity257			0
it would be good to see more @entity259 elsewhere in the higher reaches			0
but it would be equally valuable if the president took stock of how decisions and execution of national security issues are managed inside			0
for all the controversy , books by @entity4 , @entity10 , @entity107 and others offer invaluable guides			2
each of them has made yet another contribution to the well - being of the country .			0

@entity277 : @entity31 allies focused on whether @entity4 should have written book so soon
he says @entity7 insiders have been telling tales on administrations since @entity64
the real *problem* is a swollen and all - controlling @entity22 staff , he says
@entity277 : experienced leaders like @entity4 need to be given scope for decision making
