-- a debate is raging over the tragic case of @entity3 , who left his 22 - month - old boy , @entity4 , in a car all day			1
@entity4 perished , and now his father has been charged with murder and child cruelty			1
some people call this a tragedy , and some call it a crime			0
who is right ? @entity3 will appear in court thursday to face a probable cause hearing in which the prosecution will try to convince a judge that it was indeed a crime			1
the defense will likely try to show that @entity3 ' act was simple negligence			1
either way , the focus will be on why @entity4 was left in the car -- and although this seems counterintuitive -- for the purposes of the criminal proceedings , the tragic death will not be material for determining guilt			0
to make the case that @entity3 committed premeditated first - degree murder by intentionally leaving his child in a car to die , the justice system will need to look at his prior history , both criminal and psychological , and consider any other acts that show a complete disregard -- or worse -- for the child			1
we should see some previous behavior consistent with his ability to act as one of the worst that we identify in our society : people capable of killing their own children			2
this behavior could include anger at the child or the child 's mother , pending divorce litigation , frustration at an illness the child suffers , financial distress or other stressful situations			1
the defense and the prosecution and law enforcement have to examine these considerations quickly			0
if they decide that @entity3 is not the worst among us -- if he is not someone guilty of filicide -- then the alternative is one of negligence			1
in this case , the cause of " just forgetting his child in a car " needs to be analyzed			1
we as humans often want to reassess our decisions based upon the outcome			0
deciding to stay late at work and then being involved in a major accident on the way home puts focus on whether or not you should have stayed late			0
splurging for dessert after dinner and getting hit by a car while crossing the street suggests the dessert was significant			0
the reality is when that decision is made , it is almost always inconsequential			0
nobody would have considered it significant if @entity3 had walked 10 paces away from his car toward his work and then remembered @entity4			1
the fact that a simply negligent mistake had devastating consequences does not , logically or rationally , make the act grossly negligent or criminal in and of itself			1
@entity0 legal analyst @entity105 bravely confessed in an opinion piece that she once left her child in the car , something she realized in horror a few moments later			2
if @entity3 ' mistake was one of simple negligence , that he truly just forgot to drop @entity4 off at day care , then the question is : should we make a simply negligent act that has significant consequences a criminal act because of those consequences ? that is an extraordinarily dangerous precedent to set			1
thousands of cars get in accidents every day , most caused by simple negligence			0
some are fender benders , some cause significant property damage , some cause simple injuries , some cause significant injuries and some end up with people dying			0
our law is well settled in that context -- it is the negligent act that we focus on and not primarily the result			1
one concept that we use in all of our jurisprudence is the reasonable man theory			0
that is , most people are presumed to act in a reasonable way , with the term reasonable determined by our societal norms			0
we judge each other in many circumstances based upon whether or not we 've acted reasonably			0
the reasonable man concept appears in other aspects of criminal law			0
in self - defense cases , we seek to find if a person had reasonable fear of great bodily harm or death			0
in civil cases , such as in personal injury law , the difference between simple negligence and gross negligence has huge implications on a plaintiff 's chances to be awarded damages -- no matter how severely he or she suffered			1
to change a well - settled principle of law -- that we are to be judged on whether we acted reasonably or negligently independently from the consequences -- would be a dangerous alteration in the way we interact , not only in the court system , but as a society			0
@entity3 probably acted with simple negligence			1
if he did , he will deal with having been the cause of his son 's death for the rest of his life , but he should not be held criminally liable			2
there is one other possibility to consider			0
if @entity3 showed a reckless disregard for the consequences of his actions or a blatant indifference to his legal duties , then he may be guilty of gross negligence			1
if it is determined that @entity3 acted in a grossly negligent way , then he should be held criminally responsible			1
if the facts came forward that he left his son in the car because he was drunk , or because he wanted to go out and party , then a criminal negligence standard would be easy to reach			2
if i drive my car in a school zone five miles over the speed limit , and run over and kill a child , i am probably only acting in a simply negligent way			2
if i do so at 70 mph , i would be acting grossly negligently , and should be held criminally liable			0
we 've all been quick to judge @entity3 , and we 're going to have to wait for all the facts to come out before we can make an informed opinion			2
in this case , making an informed opinion means making a reasoned assessment regarding whether @entity3 acted on purpose , or whether it was negligence			2
we just have to be careful not to allow the tragic consequences of the act to influence how we judge the act itself .			2

@entity3 has been charged with murder , child cruelty after son died in hot car
@entity221 : we need to look at any prior behavior that shows complete disregard for son
@entity221 : if there 's none , we look at negligence ; " forgetting child " needs to be analyzed
he says it 's wrong to judge a negligent act by consequences , no matter how *bad*
