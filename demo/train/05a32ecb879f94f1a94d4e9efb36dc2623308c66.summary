-- ever wish that you remembered every day of your life ? @entity3 did			1
so starting more than a year and a half ago , @entity3 has recorded video every single day to help him remember			1
@entity3 has compiled this footage into a piece he calls " @entity7 -- age 30			1
" using only one second of footage from each day , the video shows a variety of snippets and experiences from the @entity16 - based artist 's life			0
these scenes range from the mundane , such as browsing @entity18 and watching tv , to the adventurous , including a cross-country trip that @entity3 took after he saved up enough money to take a year off from work			1
@entity3 sat down with @entity0 at @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , to talk about his project			2
@entity0 : why did you take a year off from work ? @entity3 : frankly i was burnt out			2
i 'd been constantly working nights until midnight , until 2 in the morning , weekends and i was n't getting my creative juices off so i needed to take some time off and after having seen @entity34 's talk on " the power of time off , " i decided to save up enough money over the course of about two years and took a year off so that i could travel , spend more time with my family and pursue my own creative ideas such as the one second everyday project			1
@entity0 : can you talk about the project ? @entity3 : the one - second everyday project was something that originally started out as a way for me to chronicle my year off from work but really quickly after i started i realized that it was helping me in many more ways			1
it was allowing me to realize that i could remember everyday that i 've lived ; it was allowing me to quickly reflect back on the things that i had to done , to be able to zoom out from the past month and realize , " oh wow , i sat around a lot this month			0
" i instantly decided to do it for the rest of my life and realized the benefits were far greater than the amount of work i needed to put into it , which was just a quick second to remind me of that day			0
@entity0 : what 's your biggest takeaway from doing this project ? @entity3 : it 's a very powerful project for me			2
i really do think that putting something together like this for your own personal life , not necessarily to show other people what your life is like but so you yourself can remember what you 've done over the years , could be very beneficial to anyone			0
@entity0 : are there any seconds you would wish you could take back or do differently looking back at those days , at those frames ? @entity3 : the two seconds that i forgot that were black that just said , " whoops i forgot			2
" i learned from those mistakes , those two mistakes are painful to see on screen but those two mistakes basically led to me never forgetting to do this ever again because i can remember how i felt in this moment and that 's what this project is about			0
this project is about looking back on the days where i made a mistake or i did something wrong or i feel regret and learning from them and i found that without a project like this that i 'll not learn from mistakes because i 'll so easily forget them			0
@entity3 is currently working on a mobile app that will allow others to easily compile their own one - second everyday project			1
