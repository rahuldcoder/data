-- @entity1 , a turbaned @entity2 doctor and @entity4 professor , was surrounded recently by a gang of teenagers on bicycles who beat him , fracturing his jaw			1
he says they called him a " terrorist " and " @entity12			1
" his response : " if i could speak to my attackers , " he said , " i would ask them if they had any questions , if they knew what they were doing			2
maybe invite them to the gurdwara where we worship , get to know who we are			2
" most people would be surprised by dr. @entity1 's willingness to forgive and constructively engage his attackers			1
like most sikhs , i was taught at a young age about @entity30 , a famous @entity2 who would distribute food and water to wounded enemy soldiers			1
the lesson instilled was that the work of mending fences begins as soon as one can no longer harm you			0
as a professional advocate working with @entity2 hate crime victims for more than a decade since 9/11 , i have consistently seen @entity2 move beyond the punitive bent of our criminal justice system and adopt a @entity2 approach to addressing our attackers			1
the result is a decidedly @entity2 - @entity48 brand of justice that produces more social benefit than the revolving - door criminal justice system in our country			1
take our work with @entity55 and @entity56			0
@entity56 worked at @entity57 at the @entity58			0
he never had a chance to say goodbye to his colleagues who died there on 9/11			0
traveling on trains made him scared and angry			0
he acted on his anger a year later by pushing @entity55 on the @entity65 , urging him to leave the train and calling him a " terrorist			2
" @entity56 was stopped by an off - duty police officer , arrested , and eventually prosecuted			0
when it came time for sentencing , the prosecutor was ready to recommend jail time for @entity56			1
@entity55 did not want that to happen			0
he saw a man in real pain who needed a lift up and not jail time			1
he asked that the prosecutor recommend @entity56 engage in community service aimed at combating hate in a post 9/11 world			1
@entity56 was very nervous when he came to our office			0
he said he knew nothing about us and always thought we were " stern " and " angry			0
" he said he was surprised that one of my colleagues was wearing shorts instead of pants			0
we got to know each other and eventually @entity56 was standing with @entity55 and me as we went to gurdwaras , @entity2 houses of worship , collecting reports of bias against @entity2			1
all of us were better for the experience			0
@entity55 and i had our own prejudices and fears of people who looked like " @entity101 " and clearly @entity56 had his own perceptions about us " turban folk " as well			2
rather than allow him to spend time incarcerated in the overworked criminal justice system , we all found healing and became better people for it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity111 .			2

@entity2 doctor forgives teenagers who beat him and called him a terrorist
@entity111 works with hate crime victims who *display* a different approach
rather than jail time , he says , people who commit hate crimes can do community service
@entity1 : it 's *helpful* for victims and *perpetrators* to *overcome* fears about each other
