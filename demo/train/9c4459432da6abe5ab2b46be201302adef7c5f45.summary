in the @entity7 market , with @entity9 fuel economy ratings of 33 mpg city , 41 highway			0
for high - mileage frugality , it appears to beat the five - passenger @entity14 and its 29/35 - mpg ratings by a long shot			0
look at the inside of your car 's fuel door to find out whether you 're required to use a certain octane gasoline			1
but wait ! premium fuel -- which cost about 12 percent more than regular at @entity7 pumps last month -- is required for the fortwo			2
suddenly the gap closes and the @entity27 no longer looks like as strong of a fuel - budget buster			1
and with the requirement , they mean it : smart says you 'll lose your warranty coverage if you do n't ante up			0
with premium fuel averaging about 24 cents more per gallon than regular , your choices at the pump can add up very quickly			2
if you drive a 20 - mpg vehicle 15,000 miles a year , that 's an extra $ 180 , each year , toward those extra few octane points			1
if you have a thirstier truck or @entity42 or cover more mileage , it could amount to hundreds of dollars a year			0
new - car buyers , take notice			2
add fuel requirements to your shopping checklist , because it will impact your wallet with every visit to the gas station , for years of ownership			2
the expensive stuff is typically recommended -- though not always required -- for luxury and high - performance cars , while less - expensive sedans , coupes , and suvs only require 87 - octane			2
but there are plenty of exceptions			0
@entity62 , a spokesman for @entity63 , says that the automaker no longer has any models that require premium grade and only a few for which it 's recommended			1
regular unleaded is fine across all the models of @entity63 's @entity71 luxury brand , says @entity62 , so " as a luxury car buyer you do n't have that added premium of premium fuel			1
" @entity63 now does all of its engine development and vehicle testing on 87 - octane , regular - grade fuel			1
" we do n't want to give you a product that will have durability issues , " explains @entity62 , if premium - grade is n't available everywhere			1
another exception in the luxury - car realm is @entity86 ; the automaker chose to tune the new high - performance v - 8 engine in its @entity90 sedan for premium fuel , but it also certified it for regular - grade			1
the automaker is the first to list power figures both with premium ( 375 hp ) and regular ( 368 hp ) , letting owners opt for either top performance or a substantial savings at the pump			2
for the record , there 's no measurable difference in fuel economy between the two grades , or any greater potential for damage , according to @entity86			2
" we wanted to give customers the choice , " explained @entity86 spokesman @entity107			0
" if you want a few extra horsepower , go ahead and spend a little more at the pump			0
" along with several @entity117 automakers , the @entity115 recommends premium fuel for all of its vehicles -- including the economical @entity119 -- yet @entity63 does n't even recommend premium for its sporty , @entity114 - powered @entity122			1
the high - performance , 540 - hp @entity123 is the only new @entity63 vehicle to carry the recommendation for premium ... and @entity62 concedes the engine will get a " slight boost " from premium			1
throwing money away ? you might have been led to believe at some point that your vehicle will do better with premium , but with most newer vehicles , that 's simply not true			2
provided yours just calls for 87 - octane , chances are you wo n't notice the difference , according to a number of experts , and you 're essentially throwing the money away			1
the best way to tell , advises @entity143 , director of @entity145 's @entity144 and @entity146 , is to simply look at the inside of the fuel door ; if it says , " use premium fuel only , " and specifies a higher octane number ( regular is typically 87 , premium is 91 or higher ) , then the expensive stuff is actually required for the vehicle			1
but for people with vehicles only requiring 87 - octane , @entity143 advises , " do n't do it ; it 's a waste of money			1
" do n't let the filthy images get to you either			0
if you 've seen commercials for gasoline , you 've likely heard that premium - grade will keep maintain your vehicle 's full power and smoothness , and otherwise your valves and injectors will become clogged with ' gunk , ' and you 'll have to shoulder premature repairs			1
typically , within the same brand of gasoline , between regular and premium , " the difference is really just octane , " confirms @entity172 , @entity173 at the @entity174			0
to call a fuel regular , midgrade , or premium , @entity172 explains , only relates to octane ; there 's no other requirement that assures greater purity , more detergents , or better additives			1
@entity143 says that the emphasis on detergents and additives for premium fuels is also misleading because in most fuels you have plenty of detergents to keep modern computer - controlled engines clean			0
" unleaded is just fine , " he insists			0
more drivers are discovering that			0
last year , as gasoline prices crept past four dollars a gallon for regular grade and approached five dollars in some places for premium , many motorists with rapidly emptying wallets broke the premium habit and filled up their vehicle with regular for the first time			2
the market share of premium gas has been on a downward trend for many years -- going from 16.6 percent percent of @entity7 sales in 1997 to just 9.5 percent in 2007 , according to the @entity208 -- and although 2008 data has n't yet been released , it 's anticipated that last year even more turned to the less - expensive nozzle			1
pinging is a thing of the past for cars made several decades ago , it was up to you to listen for deadly knocking or pinging sounds -- a sign that the fuel was prematurely detonating and could quickly cause damage to engine components			0
but since the 1980s , most vehicles have had knock sensors			0
these little microphones listen for the telltale ' ping ' of early detonation and your car 's electronics automatically retard ignition timing to smooth it out			1
you do n't even need to worry that your knock sensors have broken , @entity143 says , because it would set off the ' check engine ' light			0
the actual heat energy in gasoline is typically the same whether it 's regular or premium , but the higher octane rating means it can burn in a more controlled fashion -- useful only if the engine can take advantage of it			2
" higher - octane gasoline does n't make any more power , but it enables higher compression , or enables the turbochargers to produce more boost , " says @entity143			1
for vehicles that only require 87 - octane , using a higher - octane fuel wo n't yield any noticeable difference from the driver 's seat			1
it 's a bit more complicated when premium is recommended			0
look at the language in your owner 's manual first , and if it mentions that regular is acceptable there will still likely be cautions of compromised performance ; if it cautions against the regular use of regular you might be compromising your warranty			0
@entity270 spokesman @entity269 advises against using regular for any vehicle for which premium is recommended			0
" there could be some short - term knocking or pinging , but nothing lasting , " he says			0
" i would n't recommend it for the long term			0
" @entity143 , of @entity145 , adds that drivers of high - performance or luxury vehicles for which 91 - octane is recommended might actually negate their savings with regular depending on their driving style , seeing lower fuel economy			1
in a lot of cases , @entity287 sums , the fuel specs are simply an engineering issue ; the engine was designed and tested with premium fuel , and they did n't design it to run on premium -- although it might do just fine			2
if your car was n't built with an appetite for premium , save yourself the money .			0

fuel octane requirements can be found on inside of car 's fuel door
using a higher - than - required octane wo n't make car run better , experts say
@entity63 says it does all vehicle development on regular - grade fuel now
check the gas requirements for new fuel - efficient car to *maximize* savings
