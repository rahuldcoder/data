-- contrary to the @entity2 image in movies like " minority report , " technology has n't served law enforcement particularly well over the years			1
fragmented and complex operating systems have challenged police officers to manually enter information into multiple programs			0
and yet officers still struggle to retrieve the information they need -- especially in the field , where it can be a matter of life or death			0
a large number of law enforcement agencies are still hindered by antiquated technologies			2
but agencies that have upgraded their operating and investigative systems have been tremendously effective in ensuring the safety of their citizens			0
police forces like the @entity29 in @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity32 were early technology adopters and now benefit from some of the most efficient police operations and investigative systems in the world			1
these are the police forces of the future -- the ones that others will be modeling themselves after in the years to come			2
@entity42 recently studied police forces from around the world and found that in every region , police are hungry for new technology			1
they see tech such as analytics , biometrics ( identification of humans by their characteristics or traits ) and facial recognition as keys to effectively fighting crime and maximizing the time officers spend in the field			1
despite the reality of reduced budgets , law enforcement agencies that adopt new technologies can prevent crimes more effectively and solve crimes faster			1
@entity66 raises privacy concerns about police technology tracking drivers video analytics what many people do n't know is that there 's a solid infrastructure of closed - circuit tv in most cities			1
historically , these cctv cameras -- both publicly and privately owned -- have been used retrospectively to examine crime scenes for evidence			0
images from street cameras along the @entity83 route helped identify the two bombing suspects there last april			0
in @entity87 , the @entity86 now safeguards light - rail passengers with a video - analytics system that can alert security guards when it spots suspicious behaviors , such as an unmarked vehicle in a pedestrian zone			2
cities such as @entity95 and @entity96 also are testing pilot programs to apply predictive analytics to video feeds			2
@entity96 's government and economic leaders recently launched a one - year " @entity106 " pilot program to bring automated analytics to existing cctv infrastructure across the city			2
the program will apply predictive analytics to video feeds to detect which of a multitude of street incidents , such as crowd and traffic movements , pose real concerns for public safety			0
these video feeds also will identify environmental threats to public safety , such as fire or flooding , as they arise			0
when a serious incident is identified , an alert will be sent to the authorities			0
this program enables real - time information sharing and will give law enforcement deeper insight into public safety across @entity96 's densely populated urban landscape			1
it also will increase police ability to anticipate and respond to incidents as they occur			0
police embracing tech that predicts crimes data mining and predictive analytics other cities are using statistical analysis and predictive modeling to identify crime trends and highlight " hidden " connections between disparate events			1
this helps police gain a more complete picture of crime , predict patterns of future criminal behavior and identify the key causal factors of crime in their area			2
police in @entity157 , @entity158 , adopted an advanced data - mining and predictive - analytics program in 2006 in an ambitious campaign to reduce crime			1
in the first year of use , the city 's homicide rate dropped 32 % , rapes declined 19 % , robberies fell 3 % and aggravated assaults dropped by 17 %			2
police in @entity170 , also applied predictive analytics -- which relies on data - analysis software to predict where crimes will likely take place -- and saw immediate results			1
serious crime in that city fell 30 % between 2006 and 2010			1
such technology also has been hailed for helping to lower crime rates in @entity181 since its introduction by the @entity184 in 2011			0
and @entity185 , @entity186 , uses an analytics model that brings together location - based crime and traffic - crash data to develop effective methods for deploying law enforcement and other resources			1
using geo - mapping to identify " hot spots " -- areas with high rates of crimes and car accidents -- the parish saw the number of fatal drunk - driving crashes fall from 27 in 2008 to 11 in 2009 , with a corresponding increase in drunk - driving arrests			0
biometrics and beyond @entity206 on the horizon of law - enforcement technologies is biometrics , including facial recognition			1
the same software that has been used to identify high rollers and cheats in casinos , for example , can now be used to single out people banned from football stadiums or terrorists on a watch list at key border - control points			0
similar biometrics , including iris recognition , are now used to match passengers to their digital images on e-passports at border crossings all over the world , something that was unthinkable a decade ago			2
while not all police investigations resemble " csi " today , the potential for technology to reduce crime is real and proven			0
although reduced budgets are making it harder for some police forces to adopt new tech tools , all law enforcement agencies must prepare their officers to embrace new technologies as they become available			1
our future safety depends on it			0
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			0

police forces around the world are fighting crime with new data - mining tools
@entity254 's *streetcars* have video analytics that can spot suspicious behavior
major crime in @entity170 fell 30 % with software to predict where crimes might take place
next on the horizon for law enforcement : biometrics , including facial recognition
