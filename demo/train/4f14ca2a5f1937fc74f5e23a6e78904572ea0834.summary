@entity1 , @entity0 -- they 're bringing down the @entity5 flags in @entity0 and @entity6 and putting them back into storage after they got slammed in a sudden sandstorm during the last part of president @entity11 's visit			1
perhaps it was nature 's way of keeping @entity11 from feeling he had gained the upper hand in this famously unpredictable region			2
sandstorm or not , the president had reason to feel good about his trip			0
after deliberately lowering expectations about what he might achieve on the trip , @entity11 knocked it out of the park			2
he even managed to take the skeptics by surprise , helping broker the restoration of relations between @entity6 and @entity30			1
bolstering friends , strengthening alliances and sending everyone in the @entity34 a clear picture of @entity5 's vision and priorities for the region -- this was the common thread in everything the president did in @entity6 , the @entity42 and @entity0			1
he made a persuasive case that the @entity5 - @entity6 alliance is , in his words , " eternal , it is forever			2
" he spoke passionately and effectively in favor of @entity48 statehood and the need to restart the peace process			0
he made it clear the @entity5 will not tolerate a nuclear @entity52 but prefers to prevent it through diplomacy			0
he reiterated his call for an end to the @entity58 regime in @entity59 and showed his strong support for @entity0 's @entity61 , a moderate king who says he is trying to democratize his country without the need for bloodshed			1
as @entity11 returns to @entity66 , not everyone is happy about what they heard			0
but if power is the ability to influence the behavior of others and the course of events , then he managed to make @entity5 a bit more powerful after a mere three days in this turbulent region			2
in a visit filled with poignancy , symbolism and , yes , substance , one of the most dramatic and unexpected moments came minutes before @entity83 departed @entity6 for @entity0			1
as the milky white sky gave signs of trying to clear , @entity11 and @entity6 prime minister @entity84 stepped inside a trailer on the tarmac and made a historic call to @entity30 's prime minister			1
when the call was over , @entity6 and @entity30 had restored diplomatic relations			2
after an acrimonious three - year dispute over a botched and lethal 2010 @entity6 raid on a @entity30 - flagged flotilla trying to break the @entity97 blockade , @entity84 apologized			1
the reconciliation was not all @entity11 's doing , but he gave the final push that allowed two pivotal @entity66 allies to work out their differences at a time when events in @entity59 and @entity52 demand the @entity5 and its friends work closely together			1
opinion : @entity11 goes over @entity84 's head to the @entity6 people a major objective of the trip was to convince @entity6 and its enemies that the @entity5 is committed to @entity6 's survival			1
the goal is fundamental to regional stability , because as long as anyone has any doubts , those who advocate destroying @entity6 will continue pursuing the objective and gaining followers while making @entity6 more hesitant to take risks for peace			0
from the moment he landed , @entity11 alluded to 3,000 years of @entity123 history on the land			0
he told @entity6 -- in @entity125 , lest they miss it -- " @entity127 lo levad , " " you are not alone			0
" he talked about @entity6 tourists recently murdered in @entity130 , about threats from @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity52 , about chemical weapons from @entity59			2
and then he made an impassioned call for @entity6 to take the perspective of @entity48 , for the sake not only of their own security but also of justice			0
it was a masterly performance			0
by spending time in the @entity42 , @entity11 raised the profile of @entity48 president @entity143 relative to that of his rival @entity132			1
and when he declared that those who seek @entity6 's destruction " might as well reject the earth beneath them and the sky above , " his words threw a punch against @entity132 and @entity133 , whose stated objective he was labeling a hopeless cause			1
when he arrived in @entity0 , @entity5 's most reliable @entity156 ally , he widened the lens to the growing crisis in @entity59 , which is spilling over , sending more than 400,000 refugees to a country practically devoid of natural resources			1
he pledged an additional $ 200 million to @entity61 for the sustenance of the refugees still fleeing @entity59 by the thousands every day			0
opinion : the empathy president standing with the @entity0 king , with the knowledge that @entity6 and @entity30 had healed their rift , @entity11 projected an air of confidence and achievement , even if events in @entity59 seem to spin out of control ; even as @entity61 warned the @entity42 has become naive about the agenda of the @entity176 , the biggest winner so far in the so - called @entity178			1
this was @entity11 's first visit to an @entity156 country since 2009			2
back then , @entity182 was @entity5 's strongest @entity156 friend			0
today , the @entity34 is undergoing a violent and unpredictable transformation			0
during barely 72 hours in the region , @entity11 reasserted a measure of influence			0
he laid out @entity5 's vision and gave a vote of confidence to @entity5 's friends			1
it was a subdued but visible show of @entity5 influence and power in a time and a place of unexpected sandstorms and ferocious revolutions , where no man , no nation , has full control over the course of history			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			0
