-- what 's the appropriate soundtrack for kids killing kids ? that 's one of many tough questions that @entity8 - winning producer @entity7 had to answer while overseeing this set of songs inspired by the movie adaptation of @entity13 ' best - selling novel about tweens and teens forced to fight to the death			2
fans of the book might imagine its bow - hunting heroine , @entity20 , slinging arrows to the strains of something decidedly punk - rock			0
personally , i 'd like to think of her blasting @entity26 's '' rebel girl '' while she takes out @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , and anyone else who underestimates her talent for ripping out tender teenage hearts and entrails			1
but what puts @entity7 in the mood for some good old - fashioned child sacrificing , apparently , is ... folk			0
or rather , as @entity43 recently told @entity0 , '' @entity45 music 300 years from now -- what @entity41 and bluegrass music would sound like in the future			1
'' with everyone from @entity49 to @entity50 on " @entity51 " soundtrack , that 's a tall order -- though certainly @entity43 's sweet lullaby '' @entity53 , '' backed by breakout @entity56 duo the @entity57 , fits the '' @entity41 '' part			1
when she sings to an unlucky fighter , '' just close your eyes / you 'll be alright , '' she sounds like she 's finally broken out of fairy - tale - princess territory to real adulthood			1
elsewhere , the @entity66 ' furious '' one engine '' and @entity68 ' pretty '' @entity67 '' carry on the mournful fingerpicking			1
they 're lovely songs , but all that semi-acoustic brooding makes you wonder if '' @entity45 music 300 years from now '' is the same as it ever was			0
far more engaging are the artists who imagine they 've seen @entity20 ' future , and all they can say is '' go back			0
'' haunted by gorgeously sad @entity76 - belle harmonies from @entity77 and her fellow shotgun - toting @entity78 , '' @entity74 '' is deeply ominous , a song to sing when '' you hear the devil drawin ' near			1
'' best of all is @entity85 's gothic rap - rock epic '' @entity86 , '' which feels every bit as dystopian as @entity89 ' book			2
with chest - pounding military drums and a menacing @entity95 refrain ( '' you do n't talk / you 'll say nothing , okay ? '' ) , it does n't sound anything like @entity7 's kinder , gentler vision for the soundtrack			2
and maybe that 's why it totally captures the spirit of the film : if there 's one thing that the warriors of @entity107 hate just as much as the regular kids who love " @entity51 , " it 's respecting authority			0
