@entity0 did not comment on the @entity2 pipeline monday while speaking before a conservation group that is strongly opposed to the plan			1
during a 15 - minute speech , @entity5 spoke about the importance of green technology , the problems surrounding natural gas drilling and the fact that climate change exists and needs to be addressed more forcefully			2
but at no point did @entity5 address the 1,179 - mile - long project that would move oil from @entity16 to refineries in the @entity18 at the @entity21 ' @entity20 dinner			1
" there is no getting around the fact that the kind of ambitious response to effectively combat climate change is going to be a tough sell at home and around the world at a time when so many counties ... are grappling with slow growth and stretched budgets , " @entity5 said at the dinner			2
" our economy still runs primarily on fossil fuels and trying to change that will take strong leadership			0
" @entity5 also went after climate change deniers during the speech by noting sea levels are rising , ice caps are melting and storms are getting stronger			2
" we do not have to choose between a healthy environment and a healthy economy , " she added			0
@entity5 's refusal to comment on the pipeline is not new			1
the former secretary of state has repeatedly dodged the @entity2 question and gave the issue zero mentions in her 2014 memoir			2
@entity5 usually tells interested audiences -- usually groups in @entity16 or at environmental events -- that she does n't want to comment on an issue currently in the hands of her successor , secretary of state @entity59			2
but @entity2 appears to be one of the only issues where @entity5 follows that rule			1
the former first lady regularly comments on other issues currently on @entity59 's plate , like @entity66 , the ongoing conflict with @entity68 and talk over nuclear weapons with @entity71			0
both @entity72 and @entity73 have faulted @entity5 for not commenting on the issue			2
@entity75 , an @entity76 , has made the issue one of their most used recent attacks on @entity5 , while liberal groups have pushed @entity5 for specifics on her pipeline position			1
@entity82 , president of the conservation group , said he was n't disappointed that @entity5 did n't mention @entity2 , primarily because he knows she does n't comment			1
" she has already been asked about that			0
that is not her decision right now , " @entity82 said			0
" you heard her praise president @entity92 many , many times for his leadership on climate change and leaving a legacy			0
that is a decision left to him and the current secretary of state			0
that is where it should be			0
" the @entity21 has been pointedly against the pipeline for years and regularly urges supporters to call members of @entity106 and petition their government to kill the pipeline			0
that said , @entity82 would not rule out backing a candidate who supports the pipeline and points to a few pro-pipeline senators the league backed in 2014			0
related : @entity114 rejects @entity72 measure to build oil pipeline @entity5 's silence on @entity2 was made more interesting given the fact that before her speech , the former senator from @entity20 stumped for sen. @entity121 of @entity122 at a @entity20 fundraiser			1
@entity121 , a moderate @entity124 who has been one of the pipeline 's most outspoken proponents , is currently behind in a runoff race for her @entity114 seat			1
in a way to win voters , @entity121 forced a vote on the pipeline in the @entity114 earlier this month			1
though @entity121 voted in favor , many from her party did not and the bill failed by one vote			0
@entity82 said he did not find it odd that @entity5 stumped for @entity121 - a candidate the league did not back - before speaking to his group			1
" there is nothing surprising about that at all , " he said			0
" many of our best friends in the @entity114 have done similar things			0
... it is just what people do			0
" after @entity5 's speech , she sat with a number of top environmental activists , including @entity156 , a @entity2 opponent and big @entity73 donor			1
questions about @entity5 's position on @entity2 are not likely to abate soon			1
earlier on monday , organizers announced @entity5 would speak at two events in @entity16 on january 21 where @entity2 is likely going to be addressed .			1

earlier in the day , @entity5 attended a fundraiser for *embattled* pro-pipeline @entity124 sen. @entity121
