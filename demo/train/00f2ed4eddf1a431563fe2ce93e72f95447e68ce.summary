@entity0 -- @entity2 wore a white dress for her big day , @entity4 , braces , a hat and bow - tie			2
the couple , now wife and wife , tied the knot during a small ceremony led by an unregistered celebrant on a farm west of @entity14 , @entity15			1
it had all the hallmarks of a " real " wedding			0
except this one was n't valid , at least under @entity15 law			2
@entity15 is one of many countries around the world where same - sex couples are not permitted to legally marry			1
and the law does n't seem likely to change any time soon			0
prime minister @entity24 , who has long opposed gay marriage , made it clear thursday that her mind had n't been nudged by a politically risky move by @entity30 president @entity29 to back same - sex marriages wednesday night			1
" my view has n't changed and when a bill comes to the parliament later this year , moved by private members , @entity36 , one of our @entity38 members ... when that bill comes to the parliament this year i wo n't vote for it , " @entity24 told the @entity40			0
@entity36 is one of two members of parliament who have submitted a private member 's bill that calls for the legalization of gay marriage , however neither @entity24 nor main opposition leader @entity49 support it			1
" obviously at this stage we 've still got more work to do , " said @entity51 , spokesman for campaign group @entity52			0
" but we are confident that this issue has the support of the majority of @entity15 and it will eventually be supported by the leaders of our major parties			2
" @entity29 's decision to openly endorse same - sex marriage won plaudits from campaigners worldwide who have been pushing for more liberal laws since the first same - sex couples walked down the aisle in the @entity68 in 2001			1
same - sex marriages are now allowed in a number of @entity30 states and in countries including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , according to @entity52			1
wedding bells are close to ringing on same - sex marriages elsewhere : leading human rights activist @entity84 hailed @entity29 's move as evidence that support for same - sex marriage was " an unstoppable global trend "			1
" gay marriage is all about love , " he said			1
" the love of same - sex couples is just as real , strong and committed as that of married heterosexual men and women			1
prohibiting same - sex marriage devalues and denigrates the love of lesbian and gay couples			1
it signifies our continuing second class legal status			0
" @entity105 prime minister @entity104 has said he supports their legalization in the @entity105 , where authorities are currently consulting on the issue , having permitted civil partnerships since 2005			1
however the issue 's omission this week from the @entity113 , which outlines laws to be introduced in the coming months , dismayed campaigners			2
@entity117 , of gay rights charity @entity116 said he was " disappointed , " and pledged " to push both coalition parties to deliver on their promise ... by 2015			2
" after becoming the first country to legalize same - sex unions in 1989 , @entity121 is close to doing the same for same - sex marriages			1
in 2007 , @entity126 's @entity125 ruled that the rights of lesbian , gay , bisexual , transsexual and intersex ( @entity128 ) people should be protected and that a committee be formed to draft laws on same - sex marriage			1
while the government has made some progress -- such as allowing a third gender option on the census -- full protections and marriage rights have yet to be enshrined by law			2
however , in many countries @entity128 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) campaigners are nowhere near close to reaching for the confetti on gay marriage			1
simply being able to live without fear or prejudice is the aim of activists in countries where homosexuality remains taboo or illegal			0
according to a report released in may 2011 by the @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 , same - sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries , and in five of those countries the death penalty can be applied			1
the countries with the harshest penalties are in @entity76 and the @entity168			1
mps in @entity170 have repeatedly tried to introduce an anti-homosexuality bill which would make homosexual acts a capital offense ; prominent gay rights activist @entity174 was beaten to death in the country in 2011			2
and even in @entity76 , where single sex marriage was legalized in 2006 , and where the post-apartheid constitution bans prejudice on the grounds of homosexuality , attacks on gays and lesbians -- including instances of so - called " corrective rape " -- still occur			1
in other regions too , attitudes have been slow to change			0
in @entity191 , efforts to frame a @entity190 were resisted by campaigners who said that gender equality could open up room for legalizing same sex unions , according to @entity196			2
last month , a court in @entity198 backed police over its ban on a gay rights festival which officials argued could disrupt public order			0
and in @entity0 , the sexuality of pop star @entity205 made headlines when he confirmed , after years of speculation , that he was gay			0
it was said to be the first time in nine years that a pop star had come out as homosexual in @entity213 's @entity212			0
" @entity0 does n't have the gay bashing that a lot of countries have ... but at the same time you still have people who are very ignorant , " said @entity217 , chairman of the @entity218 which is organizing a concert @entity205 is due to perform at on saturday , may 12			2
the rally is part of an event to mark @entity226 ( @entity226 ) , which is observed in 60 countries			0
the official date is may 17 , the day in 1990 that the @entity229 removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders			0
" they gossip about you , or they make suggestions that hurt you very much			0
so it 's that kind of discrimination and the fact that the @entity0 government has not moved forward at all in terms of legislating against discrimination against sexual minorities , " @entity217 said			0
separately in @entity15 on saturday , campaigners will be holding a @entity245 when thousands are expected to march through major cities calling for same - sex marriage			1
" a lot of people are getting exasperated that we do n't have it yet , " said @entity249 who is organizing the @entity251 march			0
" i think it is a matter of time but it 's not going to happen without a push			0
" @entity2 said she and @entity4 were n't willing to sit around and wait " and hope " for same - sex marriage to become legal			1
" i did n't want to miss out			0
i just wanted it to be the way that we wanted it to be , despite the fact that my partner is a woman , " she said			0
" eventually , when it becomes legal , we 'll legally bind it			0
" @entity1 's @entity269 contributed to this report .			0
