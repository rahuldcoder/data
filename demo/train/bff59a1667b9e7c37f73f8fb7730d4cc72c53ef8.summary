on the stand at the police academy in the @entity57 complex , @entity15 , @entity53 and @entity31 appeared with five others			1
" we did n't even know their names until we met them here , " @entity15 told reporters asking about their relationship with the other defendants			2
they include @entity65 , son of jailed @entity9 leader @entity66			1
his mother , @entity67 -- standing outside the court wearing a badge with a picture of his sister , who was killed in august -- said their arrest was " a vendetta against his father			2
" @entity78 , a student defendant claiming no relation to @entity3 , told reporters he was receiving " repressive treatment " at the @entity81 , including a ban on food and visits			1
@entity15 and @entity31 were originally in solitary confinement in that prison			1
in their new prison , the @entity89 , they share a cell with @entity92 , allowed one hour of outdoor time a day and no books			2
they complained that conditions inside are " psychologically unbearable , " but they remained defiant			2
" if justice happens , we will be free soon , " @entity30 said			1
speaking in a metal cage and separated from journalists by rows of wooden benches and a line of police conscripts , his voice was barely audible			2

along with other relatives of the defendants and other reporters , she stood outside the prison complex early thursday morning with their two children			0

' it 's just ridiculous ' in an interview , @entity121 told @entity1 how he had visited his brother @entity123 in @entity10 's notorious @entity57			0
" there was the ability to communicate , " he said			0
" i guess that 's the only way we feel we can get through this : is trying not to get too bogged down in the emotions and the conditions that @entity123 is enduring , because that becomes paralyzing for us			0
" the family was shocked by what has happened , @entity121 said			0
" i mean , a journalist of @entity123 's credibility , it 's just ridiculous , " he said			0
he said he had taken food and clothing into prison for his brother , since it was not provided by the state			0
@entity30 , an award - winning journalist , was in @entity10 only to cover for a colleague , his brother added			1
the @entity10 government has faced a tide of criticism about the case , from professional journalism organizations and human rights groups			0
@entity150 , secretary general of @entity151 , last month described the prosecution as a " major setback for media freedom in @entity10			0
" he added , " the move sends the chilling message that only one narrative is acceptable in @entity10 today -- that which is sanctioned by the @entity10 authorities			2
" apparent mix - up the case relies on simmering sentiment against @entity3 , deemed biased to the @entity9			1
one lawyer told the court that there is a mix - up in investigations and other case documents between the @entity168 , banned by @entity10 , and @entity16			1
" which @entity3 ? " the judge asked before taking notes			1
" we believe that we have not been distorting @entity10 's image at all , " said @entity172 , head of @entity16 newsgathering , before the trial started			2
" they said we fabricated footage before they even looked at my camera , " @entity15 said			0
' it is a matter of breaking the law ' @entity183 , chairman of @entity10 's @entity184 , said the @entity3 journalists did not have the proper legal documents to work in @entity10 , creating suspicion about their activities -- although their reports aired nightly on tv			1
" we have 1,100 correspondents and journalists accredited here , legally representing 200 agencies in this country , " he told @entity1			2
" none of them have been exposed to that because none of them have broken the law			0
so it 's not a matter of freedom of speech in this case			0
it is a matter of breaking the law			0
" the @entity3 network has said its employees were not accredited in the country but argues that is no excuse for imprisoning them			1
" lack of credentials is not a criminal offense			0
... usually you get a slap on the wrist and a walk to the airport , " @entity215 said			0
criticism from journalists the case has put @entity10 in the spotlight , further fueling criticism about freedom of expression and the challenges facing journalists			2
" @entity10 authorities in recent months have demonstrated almost zero tolerance for any form of dissent , arresting and prosecuting journalists , demonstrators and academics for peacefully expressing their views , " @entity229 said in a prepared statement released wednesday			1
the @entity239 listed @entity10 as third deadliest country for journalists in 2013			2
journalists face deadly police force and violence by mobs on the street			2
" things are getting worse on so many levels , " said @entity247 , chief editor of @entity248 , which describes itself as an independent @entity10 news website			0
" on a practical level , we are not able to do the job			0
but also on a formal censorship level , with the prosecutions that are politically motivated as we all know			0
it just makes us think that we can be targeted from any side and by any means			0
" the journalists ' trial was a reminder of what awaits dissent or different voices , @entity247 explained , and it has become an " embarrassment " to the state and the judiciary			1
but the chairman of @entity10 's @entity184 disagrees about such a crackdown on dissent			0
" who said they are punished for criticizing the government ? if you watch the private and even the formal or the governmental channels , you will find criticism that has been said about the government and its actions and it was way of running things more than we 've ever had in our whole life , " @entity183 said			0
for others , the media has been almost unanimous in its support of the current military - led government , which is often blamed for fueling xenophobia and polarization to violent levels			0
international support the trial has also garnered international solidarity with protests in @entity298 , @entity299 and other cities in support of @entity10 's arrested journalists , not all of whom are included in this trial			1
@entity30 , @entity15 and @entity31 were happy to hear the news of such demonstrations			1
@entity15 raised his fist in the air in excitement			0
" wait until i get out , " he shouted			0
the three have been in detention for more than 50 days			0
the procedural hearing was adjourned to march 5 , to bring in prosecution witnesses , provide a translator for @entity92 and allow lawyers to acquire case documents			1
evidence will be examined at the march hearing , and lawyers have requested an independent expert to examine the footage the prosecution said was edited to portray a false image			1
they praised the work of the @entity327 and @entity328 embassies in @entity0 but wanted the governments of these two countries to do more			1
' they want to shut us up ' besides the three detained on december 29 , a number of @entity3 journalists were charged in absentia			1
among them is briton @entity337 , who has previously worked for @entity339 's @entity338 , @entity340 and @entity341			0
speaking at a protest against her colleagues ' detention in @entity299 , she said the @entity10 authorities ' actions were an attempt to silence reporting of views opposed to theirs			2
" certainly we are one of the only channels in @entity10 that 's watched widely that gives very much an opposing view to the military - backed government , " @entity337 said			0
" the domestic media does n't , the domestic press and tv does n't			0
they want to shut us up , and the best way to do that is to arrest some of our people in the hope that that will stop others from reporting from there			0
" @entity1 is among the journalistic organizations that have signed a petition asking for the release of the @entity3 journalists , two of whom have worked for @entity1			1
@entity1 's @entity370 reported in @entity0 and @entity371 wrote in @entity299			1
