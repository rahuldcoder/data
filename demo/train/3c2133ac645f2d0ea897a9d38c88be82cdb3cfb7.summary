-- the following resource contains answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about the @entity5			1
who actually elects the president of the @entity8 ? when voters go to the polls on @entity12 , they do not vote directly for a presidential candidate			1
instead , they cast their votes for a slate of electors who have been given the authority by the @entity18 to elect the president and vice president			1
the electors are known collectively as the @entity5			1
at the @entity23 , delegates debated the manner in which the president of the @entity8 was to be elected			1
some argued that the @entity26 should select the president , while other proposals recommended election by the people , the governors of the states or state legislatures			1
a compromise was reached in what became known as the @entity5			1
technically , it is these electors , and not the @entity8 voters , who elect the president			1
why the @entity5 instead of direct vote by the people ? the @entity18 's framers established the @entity5 as a way to avoid the direct popular election of the president			1
some of the @entity18 's authors did not trust the ability of the common voter to make the " right " decision , so they devised the @entity5 as one way of lessening the power of the popular vote			1
how does the @entity5 work ? the @entity5 , as established by the @entity18 , currently includes 538 members : one for each @entity8 senator and representative and three for the @entity55 ( under the 23rd amendment of 1961 )			1
each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the number of its @entity8 senators ( always 2 ) plus the number of its members in the @entity8 @entity64 ( based on population , this is subject to change with the @entity66 every ten years )			1
so , the breakdown of electors is as follows : 100 @entity70 seats + 435 @entity72 seats + 3 @entity55 = 538 total electors since the number of electors per state varies by population , @entity74 holds the most electors with 55			1
several states have only three electors , which is the smallest number a state can have based on the formula described above			2
for any presidential candidate to win , he or she must gain a majority of the 538 votes , or the magic number of 270			2
if no one candidate reaches 270 electoral votes , the election is thrown into the @entity64 to be decided ( under the 12th amendment of 1804 )			2
this has happened twice in @entity8 history , both in the 19th century , but the scenario could conceivably become reality in modern times with a popular third - party candidate gathering some of the electoral votes and siphoning them away from the other two candidates			2
how are presidential electors selected ? @entity104 , section 1 of the @entity18 provides that , " no senator or representative , or person holding an office of trust or profit under the @entity8 shall be appointed an elector			2
" aside from this disqualification , any person is qualified to be an elector for president and vice president			2
the @entity18 does not specify procedures for nominating candidates for presidential electors			2
thirty - six states nominate their elector candidates by state party convention , and ten of the states nominate their electors by state party committee			2
generally , elector candidates tend to be prominent state and local officeholders , party activists and other citizens associated with the party for which they are nominated			0
the @entity18 left the method of selecting electors and of awarding electoral votes to the @entity8			0
in the early years of the @entity138 , many states provided for selection of electors by the state legislatures			0
since 1864 , all states have provided for popular election of electors for president and vice president			0
in 48 states and the @entity55 , the presidential candidate who gets the most votes wins all the electoral votes in that state			0
this is known as the " general ticket " or " winner take all " system			0
currently , @entity155 and @entity156 provide the only exception to the " winner take all " method , awarding one electoral vote to the ticket gaining the most votes in each of the states ' congressional districts , and awarding the remaining two ( representing their senatorial allotment ) to the winners of the most votes statewide			0
this variation , called the " direct system , " was more widely used in the 19th century			0
can a candidate win the popular vote but lose the election ? under the " winner take all " system , it is possible for a candidate to win several large states and some smaller ones and get the magic number of 270 , but have fewer popular votes nationwide than his or her opponent			0
popular vote winners have failed to win the presidency on four occasions since the adoption of the 12th amendment : in 1824 , 1876 , 1888 and 2000			0
in 1824 , the electoral vote was split among four candidates , necessitating election by the @entity64 , which chose the popular vote runner - up			0
in 1876 , due to contested returns from four states , @entity26 set up an electoral commission which awarded the disputed votes to the apparent popular vote runner - up , resulting in a one - vote margin in the @entity5			1
in 1888 , the apparent popular vote runner - up won a comfortable @entity5 majority			1
in 2000 , the popular vote winner lost in the @entity5 after the outcome of a contested vote in @entity201			1
when does all of this take place ? on the tuesday following the first monday of november , in years divisible by four			0
according to the @entity18 , voters in each state cast their ballots for the party slate of electors who represent their choice for president and vice president			0
whichever party wins that state 's popular vote for president receives the elector votes for that state			0
on the monday following the second wednesday of december , by federal law , each state 's electors meet in their respective capitals and cast their votes , one for president and one for vice president			0
these electoral votes are sealed and transmitted from each state to the president of the @entity70 , who , on the following january 6 , opens and reads them before both houses of @entity26			0
the candidate for president who has attained the majority of electoral votes ( 270 ) is then declared the president			0
the new president and vice president are sworn in at noon on january 20			0
what are some arguments for and against the @entity5 ? for : against : ( @entity239 and the @entity240 )			1
