@entity0 -- when president @entity2 signed the bill repealing the so - called " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , it did not immediately end the military 's 17 - year ban on gays serving openly			1
in fact , it will take a series of actions to make that happen , and no one at the @entity15 seems to know when the actual end date might be			1
" i do n't think anybody has any idea how long this will take , " @entity15 press secretary @entity17 told reporters monday			1
even gays currently serving , albeit quietly , had muted reactions to the @entity24 's vote to end the ban			2
three such service members , speaking to @entity1 on the condition we would n't use their real names , all used the word " relief " when asked about the repeal			1
@entity2 signs ' do n't , ask ' repeal before the ban is completely lifted , the president , the secretary of defense and the chairman of the @entity37 will have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting unit cohesion and military readiness			1
and before that can happen , the @entity15 will have to go through countless regulations and rules to see if they need to be changed to reflect the end of the ban			1
@entity47 , the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness , will oversee that part of the process , with input from the individual services			0
he and his staff will be " reviewing and revising policies , directives , establishing the education and training materials , developing communication plans on how we are going to communicate with the force			0
" that 's where the mystery begins as far as the timing			2
" i ca n't put any kind of a timeline on it , " col. @entity67 , a @entity15 spokesman , said			1
" " we plan to move out carefully , deliberately and purposefully to implement it , but right now we are in the planning stages and i do n't have any specifics for you			0
" the closest @entity67 would come to predicting how long the ban might remain in effect was when he said the process " would not be slow - rolled			2
" so far , defense secretary @entity80 , who is famous for setting hard deadlines and demanding that his subordinates meet them , has set no deadline for completion of this process			0
part of the problem is that so little has been done so far			0
the @entity15 released an 87 - page " @entity89 " of the @entity91 repeal			1
it spells out how the @entity15 should handle a myriad of issues raised by the repeal , including : " prohibit the creation of separate bathroom and shower facilities based on sexual orientation " ; " prohibit berthing or billeting ( housing ) assignments based on sexual orientation " ; " no new procedures will be developed for the early separation of service members based on opposition to repeal or to serving and living with gay and lesbian service members			1
" but the plan is all recommendations -- nothing is set in stone			2
even if each recommendation is accepted , there are few details in the plan and they 'd all need to be worked out			0
even after @entity47 finishes his portion of the process and the president , secretary and chairman certify it , the repeal still does n't become law			2
another 60 days must pass before the repeal is official			2
only then can a homosexual serve openly without fear of being discharged			0
one gay active - duty service member said getting it all done quickly is important			1
" the longer we drag this out , the more confused we get , and the more lack of clarity we have and the messier the situation happens , " said " @entity136 " a military officer who is also a leader of @entity138 , an advocacy group for gay troops			1
the gay service members that @entity1 spoke to said when that day comes , do n't expect anything dramatic			1
" it 's like @entity143			2
everyone is making such a big deal out of it , but the next day ... everyone 's going to be like , oh , this was n't a big deal at all , " " @entity136 " said			2
" @entity151 " is a naval officer			0
" i do n't have any big plans to come out now , and i think i probably speak for a lot of other service members in my same position			1
there 's not going to be a huge rush to make big announcements just because the @entity24 has passed this law , " he said			0
" @entity163 " is an @entity161 staff sergeant based in @entity162			0
" i will be reserved about the subject , because i do n't think the military needs to be in my personal life			0
" while the three men said the repeal of @entity91 wo n't have much short - term impact on their lives , they all agreed that in the long run , they 'll likely stay in the military longer			1
" had this law not passed , i was seriously considering being done with the military			0
it 's very hard to live under this policy , " " @entity136 " said			0
" i was not going to re-enlist unless this policy was taken away ; now i have an open path			0
" earlier this year , a @entity0 think tank invited military officers from countries that have long allowed gays to serve openly			1
several of those officers said their countries adopted their rules almost overnight with no adverse effects			0
they recommended that the @entity188 do the same			0
but that wo n't be the case			0
it will be months , at least , before gays can serve openly in the @entity188 military			0
by then it 's possible @entity80 will no longer be leading the @entity15			1
he 's already said he plans to retire next year , and @entity17 said he does n't know if @entity80 plans to stay until the process is complete .			1

no one in the @entity15 seems to know how long it will take to enact repeal
@entity15 's " @entity202 " is all recommendations
" the longer we drag this out , the more confused we get , " gay service member says
gay service members say repeal makes them more likely to stay in the military
