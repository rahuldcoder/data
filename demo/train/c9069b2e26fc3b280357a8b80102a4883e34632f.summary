-- @entity1 resumed pumping heavyweight drilling mud friday in its attempt to cap a breached oil well in what the company 's top executive described as an " environmental catastrophe			1
" the oil giant has measured " some success " with a procedure known as " top kill , " which had never been tried a mile under the ocean 's surface , said @entity15 , @entity1 's chief executive officer			1
the oil leak stopped when heavy drilling mud was pumped into the well at high pressure but it was not clear whether the operation would permanently halt the flow , @entity15 said			2
" clearly while we 're pumping mud , there is no oil and gas coming into the sea , " he said			2
a thick brown stream of liquid seen gushing from the broken pipe into the water was almost entirely composed of water - based mud -- not oil , he said			2
" it 's like an arm - wrestling match of two equally strong forces , " said @entity1 's managing director , @entity35			1
he predicted the company would know by sunday morning if it is working			1
supply ships on the surface are loaded with about 50,000 barrels of mud , and backups with more of the substance could be moved in quickly , he said			0
@entity48 @entity47 adm. @entity46 , who is leading the federal government 's oil spill response efforts , said the goal is to send enough mud down into the breached well bore to eliminate the upward pressure from the oil and clear the way for a cement cap to be put into place			1
" so while i said the hydrocarbons had been stopped , that does not mean the exercise is over , " @entity46 said			0
@entity1 suspended the effort thursday after determining that too much of the viscous substance was escaping via the breach instead of going down the well			1
during that suspension , @entity1 tried another technique -- known as the " junk shot " -- pumping solid materials such as rubber balls and other debris , @entity15 said			1
the junk shot began thursday afternoon and concluded early friday			1
asked whether the junk shot helped , @entity1 chief operating officer @entity70 said , " we believe that it is helping to some degree , but it is very , very difficult to interpret each of those cases			1
" " top kill " efforts will continue until at least sunday morning , @entity70 said			1
" we will continue with this operation until such time as it 's either successful or we believe it wo n't be successful , " said @entity70			2
" i think the key thing here is to exercise patience			0
" if the " top kill " fails , the next step would be to place a " lower marine riser package " -- basically a custom - built cap -- over the leak , @entity70 said			1
he added that several versions of the device are " waiting to go			0
" if they fail , he said , @entity1 engineers would try placing a second blowout preventer on top of the first , which failed catastrophically			1
the failed blowout preventer is a 48 - foot - tall , 450 - ton apparatus that sits atop the well 5,000 feet underwater , which failed to cut off the oil flow after the april 20 explosion aboard the @entity102 drilling platform left 11 men missing and presumed dead			2
the @entity105 oil spill is the largest in @entity48 history			1
government scientists said thursday that as many as 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil were spewing into the ocean every day , making this disaster perhaps twice the size of the @entity113 incident			2
previously , government scientists had said 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons ) of oil were gushing out every day			2
on may 17 , @entity15 had said the spill would have a modest impact on the environment			0
he upgraded his assessment on friday			0
" this is clearly an environmental catastrophe , " @entity15 said			0
" there 's no two ways about it			0
" he sympathized with @entity105 residents who have expressed anger over the disaster			0
" i understand perfectly why everyone is angry and frustrated that this leak has not been stopped , " he said			0
" we want it stopped and we are doing everything we can to stop the damn leak			0
and we are going to continue to do everything we can to stop the damn leak			2
" @entity15 cited " at least seven failures " that conspired to bring about the disaster			0
under intense political pressure to take control of the situation , president @entity135 toured the region friday -- his second visit since the april 20 explosion aboard the @entity102 drilling platform triggered the spill and left 11 men missing and presumed dead			1
" we want to stop the leak , we want to contain and clean up the oil and we want to help the people in this region return to their lives and livelihoods as soon as possible , " the president told reporters			2
surrounded by more than a dozen @entity105 - area politicians and officials , the president called the oil spill " an assault on our shores , on our people , on the regional economy and on communities like this one			1
" @entity135 said it would be welcome news if @entity1 's top kill effort succeeds in stopping the runaway flow from the well , but noted that other efforts are also under way			1
oil spill demystified : a glossary " a team of some of the world 's top scientists , engineers and experts -- led by our energy secretary and @entity179 - winning physicist @entity178 -- has for some time been exploring any and all reasonable contingency plans , " he said			1
@entity135 said he has directed homeland security secretary @entity181 and @entity46 to triple the manpower in places where oil has hit shore or appears within a day of doing so			1
information about resources available to area residents and businesses will be posted on whitehouse.gov , he said			0
" @entity1 is the responsible party for this disaster , " he said			1
" but as i said yesterday and as i repeated in the meeting we just left , i ultimately take responsibility for solving this crisis			0
i 'm the president and the buck stops with me			0
" more from @entity135 's press briefing he also called on @entity48 to help by visiting the region			1
except for three beaches in @entity201 , all the @entity105 beaches are open , safe and clean , he said			0
after @entity135 left , several hundred workers who had been shipped in early friday by @entity1 also left , according to a @entity204 official			1
@entity206 councilman @entity205 told @entity0 's " @entity211 " that the workers were offered $ 12 an hour to go to the scene at @entity209 and work while @entity135 was there and that they left shortly after @entity135 did			1
@entity70 downplayed the claim friday evening , saying it is not unusual to see people wrapping up work in the afternoon			0
@entity216 : share your views on the oil spill response " these individuals are working out in the heat of the sun. these are long days			0
they start early in the morning and they stop early in the evening , " he said			0
" so the fact that they were leaving the location late in the afternoon was not unusual			0
it 's not associated with the president arriving			0
" @entity70 added that the workers would be back saturday morning to continue working			2
though about 25 percent of the @entity105 exclusive economic zone has been put off limits , most federal waters in the @entity105 are open to commercial and recreational fishing , according to the @entity234			0
in a response to some local officials , who have been calling for the @entity237 to build a " sand boom " offshore to keep the water from getting into the fragile marshlands , @entity135 said @entity46 is prepared to authorize moving forward with " a portion of the idea			1
" that did not entirely satisfy @entity201 gov. @entity244 , who has advocated immediate construction of the berms			0
noting in a written statement that 107 miles of the state 's coast have been oiled , he said , " we continue to ask federal officials to approve our entire sand - boom plan from the northern @entity253 to the @entity255 chain			2
" @entity0 's @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 contributed to this report .			0

new : " top kill " efforts will continue until at least sunday morning , @entity1 says
officials will triple the manpower where oil has hit shore , @entity135 says
" this has already been the largest cleanup effort in @entity48 history , " @entity135 says
@entity1 uses " junk shot " in effort to clog oil well
