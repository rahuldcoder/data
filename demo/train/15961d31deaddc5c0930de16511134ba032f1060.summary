@entity0 and tennis ? really ? yes the country known in sporting terms for dominating ice hockey and curling is prospering in a summer sport			1
and at least among the men , @entity0 is trumping the @entity7 , its more heralded and populous neighbor			1
early last year , @entity9 achieved a significant milestone when he became the first non- @entity7 male to assume the position of @entity14 no. 1 since rankings began in 1973			1
" did n't expect that one to happen , " @entity16 , the controversial , charismatic and talented former no. 1 , said in a conference call			0
" i guess i learned to expect the unexpected			0
" while @entity9 's feat said much about the amply discussed state of the @entity7 men -- from having 42 players in the top 100 this week in 1984 , only six found themselves there at the start of this week 's @entity24 -- it was the beginning of an unprecedented boom in @entity0 tennis thanks to the 23 - year - old , @entity28 and @entity29			1
boom in singles , that is			2
@entity33 is one of the greatest doubles players of all time and continues to collect titles at the age of nearly 42			2
@entity9 , still the continent 's top male player and ranked sixth overall , is frequently mentioned in the same breath as @entity41 's @entity40 when it comes to players able to threaten the " @entity45 " of @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 and potentially claim a grand slam title			1
he has bettered that illustrious quartet in one area this year , despite suffering from a lower leg injury in january and february			0
@entity9 is the lone player to reach at least the quarterfinals in six @entity55 events			1
" it 's been great , " @entity9 told @entity56			1
" i 've put myself in weekend parts of tournaments , in the quarters or better most of the time so i 've given myself a shot against the top guys			2
" no wonder he has high hopes at the year 's final grand slam			2
" i believe i can win the tournament , so that 's what i 'm pushing to do , " @entity9 said			1
he is already the highest - ranked @entity0 man in history , easily surpassing @entity0 - turned - @entity71 @entity70 's no. 41 in 1994 , and was the first man from his nation in more than a century to reach the semifinals at @entity75			1
with a serve considered one of the best in the game and a temperament as unwavering as his well - manicured hair , he should be around for a while , too			2
he emerged earlier than @entity28 , but the 20 - year - old -- whose first language is @entity87 , despite the francophone sounding family name -- has turned into a media darling a la a trio of @entity14 blondes of decades past , @entity81 , @entity82 and the 1984 @entity24 semifinalist from @entity0 , @entity84			1
she even has her own fan club , the " @entity94			0
" given the name @entity97 because of her mother 's fascination with @entity101 royalty , destiny appeared to be on @entity28 's side when she made july 's @entity75 final -- she was the first player representing @entity0 to play in a grand slam singles final			1
but @entity105 scuppered any hopes of a @entity108 ending with a masterful display of power tennis that left even the feisty @entity28 in tears			1
yet , she has reached at least the semifinals of the year 's first three majors , something 17 - time grand slam champion @entity116 and five - time grand slam champion @entity117 -- @entity28 's idol -- did n't accomplish			1
@entity28 's loss of form entering the @entity24 is likely a slight wobble instead of a longstanding concern			1
high expectations do n't faze her			2
" it 's a position i want to be in , " she told reporters on the eve of the @entity127 event			2
@entity129 trumped @entity9 and @entity28 in one department -- becoming a grand slam winner at the highest level			1
he and @entity14 partner @entity133 triumphed in the men 's doubles at @entity75			1
the baby - faced @entity129 , whose weapons are his serve and forehand , faced @entity9 in the first all - @entity0 final on the men 's tour in @entity142 in early august			1
he broke into the top 30 this year in singles and , if not for a back injury , might have gone farther			2
" it was tough because i was gathering so much momentum throughout 2013 and then i felt like i was playing great tennis at the start of this year , " @entity29 told @entity56 before he lost his first - round match at the @entity24			1
" then i hit a bit of a wall there , a big speed bump			0
" the rapid success has surprised @entity156 captain @entity155 , who achieved a career high of no. 90 in 1988			0
with @entity155 at the helm , @entity0 surfaced in a maiden @entity156 semifinal in 2013			2
" we had a few athletes spread out during the generations doing a few good things here and there , but never really was there a club like this where they broke through on the international stage at the same time , " @entity155 told @entity56			0
the inevitable question is , why now ? " @entity172 's development programs , especially in @entity173 , have been excellent , but in many ways the best players -- @entity9 in @entity177 , @entity28 in @entity173 and @entity178 in @entity179 -- owe the most to their families and individual coaches , " @entity0 's longest serving tennis writer , @entity176 , told @entity56			1
touching more on @entity172 's contribution , @entity155 brought up several factors			0
the focus , he said , has shifted to high performance and development			0
more resources , he added , have allowed the governing body to hire experienced coaches from other countries -- @entity155 cited @entity192 , who worked extensively in @entity193 -- and junior players can attend the tournaments they want rather simply choose the cheapest option			0
" @entity197 came in and helped to change the mentality of the @entity0 tennis players , " said @entity155			1
" i do believe we believe more in our capabilities to break through			0
" the mentality is a big part of it , definitely			0
" to that end , @entity28 was n't just happy to reach the @entity75 final , and @entity9 said @entity75 was bittersweet			1
he took pride in getting to the last four but was " upset " with his straight - set loss to @entity46			0
thus instead of doing media rounds when he got back home , @entity9 almost immediately went straight back to training			2
" as soon as i got my time off , i actually left @entity0 , " said @entity9			1
" i wanted to be away from the things that might follow after tennis			0
" when i came back and started training , i trained away from the tennis facility and actually ( trained ) where @entity177 's ( @entity217 ) team trains			2
" i think it was a great result in general at @entity75 , but i was upset with the way it finished so i wanted to put that behind me and get my nose back into the work			2
" now , according to @entity155 , the key is to maintain the momentum			0
having a major star or handful of pros thriving is no guarantee of sustained success			0
@entity232 , the home of @entity234 and @entity235 , does n't have a men 's player in the top 200			1
@entity233 , meanwhile , could n't capitalize on @entity238 's enormous popularity			0
helping @entity0 is its tennis infrastructure -- a major training hub lies in @entity173 -- and more people in the country , according to information provided by @entity172 , are playing the sport			1
the performances of @entity9 , @entity28 and @entity129 should maintain the trend for the foreseeable future			1
" when things get hot but there 's no structure behind it , well , there are so many options for kids to go into that are exciting , " said @entity155			0
" you want to pick up the game , you go here			0
how old are you ? you can go here			0
where do you live ? you can go here			0
" that 's very important			0
when i look back at the @entity238 era , he was probably one of the greatest known sports figures in the world at one time			0
" especially in @entity233 , tennis was very popular			0
why did n't they see a boom behind @entity238 ? it was because that was lacking			0
it 's important for us to have a structure in place -- and we do have it in place			0

@entity0 's @entity9 is the top - ranked @entity14 male on the tennis tour
twenty years *ago* , no one could have forecast that and the @entity7 men 's slump
@entity0 tennis is on a high with @entity9 , @entity28 and @entity29
@entity28 and @entity9 excelled in @entity75 singles and @entity129 won in doubles
