-- we knew even while researching tuesday 's feature on the global impact of @entity5 tourism that the story was likely to generate strong reactions among readers			1
after all , in a matter of just a decade or so , @entity5 tourists have gone from being relatively rare outside of @entity12 to becoming the most important market in global tourism , surpassing @entity16 and @entity17 travelers in 2012 as the world 's top international spenders , with a record $ 102 billion shelled out on the road			1
@entity5 travelers the world 's biggest spenders but even we were taken aback by the intensity of the emotions -- often thoughtful , sometimes ugly , always illuminating -- the story elicited among our global readership			1
( per @entity0 policy , we 've been monitoring and removing the explicitly hateful and threatening comments from the site			0
) many readers focused on the individual habits of @entity5 tourists , positive and negative			1
all comments are at the bottom of this : @entity5 tourism : the good , the bad and the backlash @entity38 summed up the feelings of the more outraged commenters : " basically get ready for loud conversations , small tips , deceptive behavior and cutting in line			1
for anyone who has traveled to @entity12 , @entity5 in particular , you know all too well what i 'm talking about			1
@entity5 are rude and inconsiderate			1
think i 'm too opinionated ? spend a week in @entity5 and get back to me			1
" weighing in from @entity50 , @entity49 voiced a similar sentiment : " here in @entity50 it 's a big deal			0
they ca n't stand @entity5 tourists and are complaining to the government about it			1
@entity5 people are quite rude compared to any other culture i 've ever experienced			1
" readers such as @entity60 , however , reported markedly different experiences with @entity5 travelers : " i deal with lot of @entity5 tourist every summer and i have to say that they are very kind			1
they leave impression of shyness			0
i do not know if they do n't talk much anywhere or they are just shocked by cultural differences but they are very very [ quiet ] , and most of them do n't speak at all ( even though they know @entity76 language )			0
" added tigerlee : " not only you guys but people in @entity5 feel uncomfortable with this group of people [ rude travelers ]			1
but most of @entity5 are friendly and good mannered			1
" a number of readers compared the reputation of modern @entity5 travelers with another frequently bashed group			1
wrote @entity88 : " anyone remember ' @entity90 ' and similar discussions about @entity16 travelers not all that long ago ? " apparently , not all of those conversations are from so long ago			0
said britishpal : " i worked in hotels for a number of years , and time after time the thing that got staff all panicked and on edge were when @entity16 tourists were expected			0
most of the rude behaviors described in this article could just as easily be attributed to @entity16 tourists ; demanding services that are n't offered , expecting meal times to be extended far beyond reasonable hours , the expectation that their cash - flashing would give them extra entitlements , etc. and to be fair , i 've heard @entity111 tourists are just as bad in @entity113 countries , even outside of @entity115 events			1
" wrote fattsmann : " i 'm @entity5 - @entity16 and i agree that mainland @entity5 are horrible tourists based on my trips to @entity113 and the @entity119			1
the article hits all the key notes and as other comments have noted , @entity16 had the same stigma / problems about 1 - 2 decades ago			0
the key issues are education and awareness of foreign cultures ( including learning the basics of a foreign language before travel ) , respect for foreign cultures and customs , and patience ( including waiting in line , not making snap defensive judgments , etc. )			0
years ago , it was @entity16 that were rude and culturally insensitive tourists			0
now it 's the @entity5			1
then it will be another group of people with money to travel			0
" like fattsmann , a number of mainland @entity5 and @entity5 citizens of other countries were anxious to join the conversation			2
wrote ptran281 : " as a @entity152 born to @entity5 parents ...			2
i can say i ca n't stand @entity5 tourists ! there is such a thing called lining up and waiting your turn			1
i was called a fake @entity5 when i reminded them we do n't behave like this in @entity152			2
" @entity163 provided an explanation for the perception of poor behavior abroad : " i am a @entity5 in the mainland ; as for the rudeness of @entity5 visitors which raised a fire in the comments section , i have something to clarify ... the reason why so many @entity5 nowadays are so rude and impolite is originated from abolishing of @entity175 philosophy and the wild interpersonal abuse in the notorious @entity177 launched by @entity178 ! ... so the conclusion is that @entity5 people in the mainland are the victims of tradition loss , communist political chaos , and the rudeness and lack of self - cultivation are the consequences of the above			2
" @entity189 's facebook page garnered some even more passionate responses			0
@entity191 points out that @entity5 have been global tourists for centuries : " guys , thousands of years ago the @entity5 have marveled the world			1
they are in seven continents all over the globe , chinatowns are all over the @entity16 " meanwhile , @entity199 suggests people on both sides of the tourism equation benefit from @entity5 travel			2
" the @entity16 is encouraging people at home to learn and speak @entity5			2
furthermore , many @entity16 students are studying in @entity5			2
@entity207 is helping chinese to learn more about other cultures			0
we remain certain about an effective partnership @entity16 and @entity5 could build in the future to face global challenges			2
" in the end , of course , the @entity5 travel boom -- and perhaps some of the resentment of it -- is driven by the almighty dollar			2
or , in a potential shift that seems to both worry and excite the world , the almighty yuan			0
summing up the " just because you 've got money does n't mean i have to respect you " contingent , @entity226 wrote : " in general , most mainland @entity5 who are 40 or over are suffering from this money = respect syndrome			0
the younger ones are much better at ' fitting in ' with their travel destination 's social and cultural norms			0
" perhaps in the end , @entity235 makes the best argument by taking the pragmatic approach to the issue : " the article makes @entity5 tourism sound like the yellow peril			0
if these people have the cash , bring em on ! the @entity16 is getting back at least part of the dollars that are being sent over there			0
" it 's a fascinating and important discussion that will surely continue to engage us all in the years ahead			0
if you 've had experiences as a @entity5 traveler or with @entity5 travelers , feel free to add to the discussion in the comments section below			0
minor edits have been made to some of the comments above strictly in the interest of clarity .			0
