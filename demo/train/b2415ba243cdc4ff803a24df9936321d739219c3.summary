@entity4 in his upcoming @entity3 speech , president @entity1 will call on @entity6 to simplify a tax code he deems overly complicated and weighted toward wealthy @entity8 , administration officials said saturday			1
the moves -- likely to meet resistance from @entity11 in @entity6 -- are meant to pay for the long slate of new programs the president began laying out two weeks ago designed to bolster the middle class , including offering two free years of community college to qualified students			1
@entity1 's aides have been seeking ways to expand a robust economic recovery beyond top earners , who have been buoyed by record closes on @entity23			1
despite reams of positive economic news , most @entity8 still say economic conditions in the country are only fair			0
and , if they see improvement , they are n't crediting the @entity29			0
" the middle class has yet to experience the prosperity shown in the recovery , and what you 'll see tuesday night is the vision for finishing that job , " a senior administration official said			1
@entity1 is set to propose tuesday a $ 500 tax credit for married couples who each hold jobs ; the intention , officials say , is to help alleviate the costs of child care and commuting that lead some spouses -- usually women -- to determine it makes more financial sense to stop working			1
he 'll also spell out ways to simplify the way taxpayers apply for education and child care credits , including increasing the top child care credit to $ 3,000			0
the total cost for the new provisions : $ 235 billion , according to administration officials , who spoke anonymously ahead of the plan 's official unveiling			2
for the first time since becoming president , all of @entity1 's changes would need to be approved both by a @entity67 and a @entity68 with a new @entity11 majority			1
looking to increase capital gains rate to pay for the changes , the administration is proposing about $ 320 billion in new revenue over the next decade			0
@entity1 wants to wring more taxes from investment income -- capital gains and dividends -- which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary earnings			2
since wealthy @entity8 are more likely to derive income from investments , they 'd bear the overwhelming weight of a higher rate on that type of profit			0
the tax rate for capital gains now stands at 20 % for the highest - earning @entity8			2
officials said saturday that @entity1 will call for that rate to increase to 28 % for those taxpayers			2
he will ask lawmakers to close a loophole allowing capital gains on inherited funds to go untaxed -- a so - called " trust fund " loophole the @entity29 says allows billions of dollars in capital gains to go untapped by the government every year			0
" this proposal is doing what it is intended to do , which is to make sure that the large , accumulated , unearned wealth of the wealthiest @entity8 is actually subject to tax , " an @entity1 administration official said			2
" we are quite confident that we can do this in a way that achieves that objective while in fact helping middle - class families by putting those resources to better use			1
" the arguments against raising tax rates on investment income are well established : opponents argue it poses a " double tax " scenario , since the corporate profits that drive stock prices are already subject to taxes			0
and they stress some portion of investment gains is driven by inflation			0
but @entity11 are n't necessarily opposed to altering how investment income is taxed : last year 's proposal from the top @entity11 on the @entity29 tax writing committee , rep. @entity128 , called for applying ordinary income tax rates on 60 % of capital gains and excluding the other 40 % altogether			1
that put the top rate at 21 %			0
in his speech tuesday , @entity1 also plans to all for a new fee on large financial institutions which administration officials estimated would bring in $ 110 billion ; @entity138 's plan called for an excise tax on large banks			1
" i would say that a number of the ideas that the president is outlining in this new proposal do have -- already have -- clear congressional bipartisan support , " a senior administration official said saturday			0
republicans were dismissive of the tax initiatives unveiled saturday evening			1
" this is not a serious proposal , " @entity149 , spokesman for @entity151 chairman @entity150 , told @entity5			0
" we lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler , flatter tax code , not big tax increases to pay for more @entity4 spending			0
" @entity1 has spent the last two weeks offering up an advance look at his @entity3 address , including the community college proposal , a plan to expand high - speed internet and reducing rates of federally backed mortgages			1
the early look is meant to introduce @entity8 to each scheme individually , said administration aides , who determined the yearly laundry - list of plans -- combined with updates on @entity8 's foreign policy -- was n't digestible during a single prime - time event			2
that does n't mean , however , the speech will necessarily be any shorter than the 65 - minute address @entity1 delivered last year			2
" it will still be a healthy speech in terms of breadth and length , " one official said			0
why @entity1 's going to @entity182 after his @entity3 speech			1
