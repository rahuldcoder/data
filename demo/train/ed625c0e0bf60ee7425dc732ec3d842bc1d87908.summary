" @entity23 this special holiday variation of my @entity23 gets a flavor boost from quickly flamed fresh thyme , which releases the herbal aromatics and adds a little holiday theatrics ! the recipe makes one drink			1
the " flaming agent " is green @entity32			0
with its extracts of 130 plants , it adds a sophisticated and unusual flavor			1
please use caution and good judgment when crafting any flaming drink			1

carefully using a long match or lighter , ignite the green chartreuse			0
let it flame just for a few seconds until thyme gets a tiny singe on it			1
be careful glass does not get too hot -- have something available to smother the fire if it gets too big			1

it is important to make it in this order as the simple syrup will put out the flames			0
