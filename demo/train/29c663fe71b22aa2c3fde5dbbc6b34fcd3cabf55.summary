that 's how many babies were born in the @entity3 in 2007 , the highest number ever			1
but after that , the number dropped			0
last year , just over 4 million boys and girls were born in the 50 states			0
the likely reason ? the economy , of course			0
a decline in fertility rates that began in 2008 is closely linked to financial woes that started at the same time , said a new @entity17 report issued wednesday			1
changes in personal income , per capita gdp , unemployment rates and claims , and state - level foreclosure rates all had an effect			2
in 2007 , there were 69.7 babies per 1,000 women of childbearing age			2
provisional data for 2010 showed that number had dropped to 64.7			0
the actual number of births from 2008 to 2009 rose only in one state , @entity34 , which also posted one of the nation 's lowest unemployment rates at 3.1 %			2
" this does not conclusively prove that the economic changes led to fertility changes , " the @entity17 report said			1
" however , the timing is consistent with the time it might take people to act upon fertility decisions			2
" historically , there 's evidence to back up the @entity17 analysis			1
demographer @entity49 said baby busts have occurred in other bleak economic eras of @entity3 history			1
during the @entity54 , the fertility rate fell to 76.15			1
during the oil shock decade of the 1970s , it plunged to 64.99			2
in that sense , what 's happening now is normal			0
" it 's almost certainly due to a lack of confidence in the economy , " said @entity49 of the private @entity60 - based @entity59			0
having children , he said , is expensive			0
you have to feed them , clothe them and send them to day care			0
and that 's hard when you 're without a paycheck or booted from your house			0
the same kinds of trends affect @entity78 nations as well			0
fertility rates plunged , for instance , in @entity81 when the breakup of the @entity83 destroyed the local economy			1
and they are down now , amid the current crisis , @entity49 said			0
" unemployment is rising and the airwaves flood our living rooms and cars with one bit of scary news after another , " @entity49 wrote in a 2009 report predicting birth rate declines in the current recession			1
" bad news travels fast and furiously these days , much more so than in the 1970s and 1930s			0
" but that 's not to say that @entity3 do n't want children anymore , @entity49 said			1
they are simply waiting for more prosperous times			0
the @entity17 report said @entity104 , whose employment levels and household wealth were hit hard by the recession , experienced the largest fertility declines of any racial or ethnic group			1
from 2008 to 2009 , birth rates dropped by 5.9 % among @entity112 women			2
for @entity115 - @entity3 women , rates dropped 2.4 % , and they dropped 1.6 % among white women			1
in 2009 , the @entity112 birth rate of 93.3 births per 1000 women was the lowest since 1999			1
that came after a year when unemployment among @entity104 increased 2.0 %			0
according to the @entity17 , hispanics have also been the biggest losers in terms of wealth in the recession -- @entity112 households have lost 66 % of their median wealth from 2005 to 2009			1
@entity49 said the drop in @entity3 birth rates is not significant enough to be alarming -- there 's not going to be a shortage of people anytime soon			1
but the decline could have a significant impact on markets that cater to children and families and also affect the need for teachers or other providers of children 's services			2
and things do n't appear to be changing anytime soon			0
" we 're probably in for a somewhat longer term depression of the birth rate , " @entity49 said			1
" the economy has definitely put a damper on it			0

a new @entity17 report says @entity3 's birth rate plunged after 2007
it says the decline in fertility rates *correlates* to the start of the recession
historically , there 's evidence to back up @entity17 's analysis
baby busts also occurred during the @entity54 and in the 1970s
