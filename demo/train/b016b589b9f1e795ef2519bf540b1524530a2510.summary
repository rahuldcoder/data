-- one of the most successful hostage rescues of the modern era took place on july 4 , 1976 , when @entity5 commandos stormed @entity6 in @entity7 to rescue dozens of @entity5 hostages held there by a @entity10 terrorist group			1
in key ways the raid on @entity6 differed from the raid on saturday in @entity14 to free @entity15 , the @entity17 photojournalist held hostage by @entity19 , and that resulted in @entity15 ' death			1
@entity22 ( the older brother of the @entity5 prime minister @entity23 ) led the @entity6 raid			2
an officer who read @entity25 to relax and an intense @entity5 patriot , @entity23 paid close attention to the smallest details of any operation he commanded			0
at the time of the @entity6 raid it was virtually unthinkable that a force would fly more than seven hours from @entity5 to @entity7 to launch a rescue operation			1
adding to the element of surprise , the @entity5 commandos who landed at @entity6 wore @entity7 uniforms and the lead assault element drove the same type of @entity39 that was then driven by @entity7 generals			2
it took only a few minutes between the first @entity5 transport plane landing at @entity6 and the commandos securing the hostages , but @entity23 was mortally wounded in the assault			0
the seven terrorists and dozens of @entity7 soldiers were killed in the raid , as well as three hostages			0
102 hostages were freed , by any measure a great success			0
adm. @entity53 , the commander of the raid that killed @entity55 in @entity56 in 2011 , published a book almost two decades ago , @entity58 : case studies in @entity60 , which is regarded as the bible for how to best understand and plan special operations			1
for the book , @entity53 interviewed the key participants in a number of @entity67 raids such as the @entity6 operation			0
after a careful examination of a number of raids @entity69 identified some key principles that had made these operations a success : speed , purpose and , of course , the critical element of surprise			0
-- @entity75 meant that " relative superiority " over the enemy needed to be achieved in the first few minutes of the attack , as it was at @entity6 , and that the entire mission should be completed in around half an hour			0
-- @entity85 meant both that the operation was well understood by each of the soldiers involved -- " release the hostages " at @entity6 -- and that the soldiers were completely committed to the mission			0
-- @entity92 meant catching the enemy entirely off guard , as had happened at @entity6			0
with these principles in mind it 's clear that the operation on saturday in @entity14 conducted by members of @entity100 to free @entity101 lacked the crucial element of surprise , in particular , because two weeks ago a seal team had raided another location in @entity14 in an unsuccessful bid to locate @entity15 , an operation that received widespread media coverage			1
on saturday @entity15 was being held in a compound in southern @entity14 by well - armed militants , which made a surprise approach difficult			1
the militants may have been alerted to the operation by a barking dog when @entity17 forces were still 100 yards away			1
another account suggests that one of the militants was relieving himself outside and spotted the seal team and alerted his colleagues			0
alerted to the @entity122 ' approach the hostage takers mortally wounded @entity15 and @entity124 , a @entity125 teacher , who they had also captured			1
achieving the element of surprise was made particularly difficult by the failure of the previous @entity67 attempt			0
on november 25 , @entity17 special operations forces along with a @entity14 counterterrorism unit successfully freed eight foreign hostages in a raid on a location in @entity14 where @entity15 was believed to be held			1
unlike saturday 's operation , this raid did have the element of surprise , but it suffered from a lack of up - to - date intelligence			1
the militants had reportedly moved @entity101 to a new location days before the raid			0
this surely prepared the militants holding @entity15 for the possibility of another @entity17 raid to free him			1
@entity17 @entity147 have a mixed record when it comes to the tricky task of rescuing hostages held by well - armed terrorists			2
in july , a special operations team conducted a raid in the @entity156 city of @entity157 in an attempt to free @entity159 , a 40 - year - old @entity17 journalist held by @entity161 , as well as other westerners captured by the group			1
the special operations team flew modified @entity166 helicopters deep into @entity161 - held territory and according to @entity17 officials killed a " good number " of militants , but the western hostages had been recently moved			2
in another failed rescue attempt , @entity172 , a 36 - year - old @entity173 aid worker in @entity174 , was killed when @entity17 commandos tried to free her from her @entity178 captors on october 8 , 2010			1
@entity17 forces arrived in helicopters in a remote area of eastern @entity174 , but because of the remote location they lacked much of the element of surprise			1
in the ensuing firefight , a seal threw a fragmentation grenade killing @entity172			0
the seal was later disciplined for throwing the grenade			0
@entity188 have also successfully freed @entity17 hostages , particularly when they had up to date intelligence and maintained the element of surprise			1
on january 25 , 2012 , members of @entity100 parachuted into @entity193 and hiked two miles to a compound where @entity193 pirates held @entity196 , a 32 year - old @entity17 aid worker , and @entity198 her 60 - year - old @entity200 co-worker			2
they surprised the pirates and freed @entity196 and @entity202			0
there 's also the well - known case of the rescue of capt. @entity206 whose ship the @entity208 was hijacked by @entity193 pirates in 2009			2
three @entity122 sharpshooters on a @entity17 warship tracking the @entity208 fired simultaneously at the pirates from a distance of 30 yards in heaving seas at nightfall , killing them all			2
the @entity122 were able to generate surprise through astonishing sniping skills married to technology -- night vision scopes allowed them to shoot and kill the pirates in a matter of seconds and free capt. @entity206 unharmed			2
in another successful mission on september 7 , 2005 , the @entity224 's @entity223 rescued @entity226 , an @entity17 contractor who was kidnapped in @entity229 in 2004 by armed men from a local kidnapping ring demanding a $ 12 million ransom			1
the @entity223 operators were pointed to the house where @entity226 was held because of good intelligence from an @entity237 detainee and when they dropped onto the house from helicopters they found that the kidnappers had fled			0
successful @entity67 missions require good intelligence and the element of surprise			2
hostage rescues are particularly tough as they require not only reaching the target undetected , but also doing the operation in a manner that ensures the hostages ' safety			0
even the brilliant operation to release the hostages at @entity6 resulted in the deaths of three of the hostages			0
some of the successful recent hostage rescues such as the operations that freed @entity196 and @entity202 , @entity206 , and @entity226 were operations to free hostages held by criminal groups rather than by terrorists			1
as terrorist groups like @entity19 and @entity161 frequently engage in hostage taking , @entity17 special operators may increasingly find themselves confronting enemies who are better armed and trained and more willing to threaten the lives of hostages than is the case of ordinary criminal groups .			1

raid to free @entity17 photojournalist @entity15 resulted in his death
@entity276 : successful rescues usually have the *benefit* of surprise
in the @entity15 case , an earlier rescue effort *preempted* the possibility of surprise , he says
