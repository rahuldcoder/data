-- the new football season is still some weeks away , but already in @entity3 allegations of racial abuse towards @entity6 's @entity5 have marred a friendly			1
the @entity9 - born @entity8 player smashed the ball into the stands and walked off the pitch during tuesday 's friendly game against @entity14 in the northern city of @entity16 after becoming enraged by a section of supporters			1
the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) confirmed wednesday that it was examining the incident			1
" the @entity21 has opened an investigation to ascertain the extent of the racist incident that took place yesterday evening at the @entity26 in @entity16 during the @entity6 - @entity14 match ( @entity28 ) , which saw @entity6 player @entity5 the subject of chants from some supporters in the stands " said the @entity3 statement			1
in january , @entity5 's teammate @entity33 walked off the field of play after being racially abused by a number of fans during a friendly game against @entity39 with six people hit with two - month prison sentences			1
however @entity6 said that @entity5 's decision to leave the field was " not a decision he should have taken upon himself to make			1
" " on the evening of july 23rd 2013 there was another episode involving racist intolerance and this time the victim was @entity5 , who reacted by leaving the field of play , " read the @entity6 statement			1
" this was not a decision he should have taken upon himself to make and despite his more than understandable reasons and the anger he must have felt , @entity6 would like to remind everyone that the only people responsible for intervening against any manifestations that offend the human dignity , which includes racial discrimination , are the referee in charge of the match and the head of public safety			1
" the use of the legal system and institutional rights , which every member of the public requires to exist in a civil society , does not compensate for the fact that these episodes continue to happen at a frequent rate			2
" both @entity5 and @entity33 declined to be interviewed by @entity0 , while @entity14 issued the following statement on its website			1
" with reference to the incident that occurred during the @entity28 , @entity14 await the results of the investigation and fully condemn any racist expression , " it read			2
" in any case , we also underline the extraordinary fair play of @entity14 fans in general			0
over the years and during the @entity28 last night they supported their team with the utmost sporting values , never transcending into vulgar chants and ensuring visiting fans enjoyed their hospitality			0
" the incident is the latest in a long line of unsavory episodes of racism which have dogged @entity98 football in recent times			2
only last may , the @entity3 itself came under fire from @entity103 president @entity102 after the @entity98 organization fined @entity105 $ 65,000 after its fans were found guilty of racially abusing @entity6 's @entity107			1
" you will always find money , " @entity102 told the world governing body 's website at the time			0
" what is $ 65,000 for such an incident ? i 'm not happy and i will call the @entity115			2
that 's not a way to deal with such matters			0
" in april , @entity119 were fined nearly $ 60,000 by @entity121 governing body @entity120 after its fans were found guilty of " improper conduct " in chants directed towards @entity125 striker @entity124			0
two months earlier , @entity126 received its fourth charge of racist behavior this season -- with @entity105 's city rivals having been fined nearly $ 300,000 after repeated fan transgressions			0
in may , @entity103 adopted tougher penalties for racist behavior during its congress in @entity134			0
punishments for first offenses bring a warning , fine or clubs being forced to play games in empty stadiums			0
a second offense , or one deemed " serious , " could result in demotion , a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament			0
@entity103 also confirmed that any individual found guilty of racist chanting will be suspended for at least five matches			0
according to @entity120 guidelines , which are adhered to by all professional clubs in @entity120 , there is a three - step procedure for abandoning games if they are marred by racist chanting			2
first , the referee should halt the contest and ask for announcements to be made over the public address system			2
the second step would be to suspend the match for a given period of time and , finally , abandon it .			0
