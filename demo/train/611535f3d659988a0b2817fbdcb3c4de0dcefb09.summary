@entity0 , @entity1 -- the man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb - and - gun rampage in @entity1 last summer said his actions were justified to save the country from multicultural forces as he went on trial monday			1
@entity11 raised his arm in a fascist - style salute -- a symbol of " strength , power and defiance against @entity19 tyrants , " to quote the 1,500 - page manifesto attributed to him -- as soon as his handcuffs were removed in court monday			1
" i acknowledge the acts but do not plead guilty , " he told the court			0
his trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror is expected to last up to 10 weeks			0
he is accused of setting off a bomb in central @entity0 that killed eight people , then fatally shooting 69 people at a youth camp run by the ruling @entity33 on nearby @entity34			1
dressed in a black suit and sporting a jawline beard , @entity11 listened impassively as prosecutor @entity37 read the charges , describing how dozens of young people were shot to death			1
@entity11 says his rampage was meant to save @entity1 from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of @entity1 , said his lawyer , @entity44			1
in his manifesto , @entity11 railed against @entity47 immigration and @entity49 liberalism , including the @entity33 , which he said was allowing the " @entity50 of @entity49			1
" and in court , he called the trial political and objected to the judge 's friendship with a former justice minister			2
" i do not recognize the @entity1 court			0
you 've gotten your mandate from political parties that support multiculturalism , " he said			0
" ok , we will make a note of that general objection , " judge @entity62 said curtly			0
prosecutors played a recording of a terrified girl phoning for help during the shooting rampage , a recording punctuated by constant firing in the background			1
they also showed security camera video of the central @entity0 bomb blast that killed eight people , images that participants in the trial watched with ashen faces			1
@entity11 sat in court without restraints , behind a bulletproof glass barrier set up to protect him during the six hours of proceedings			1
prime minister @entity85 vowed to double down on @entity1 's traditions of liberal democracy in response to the attacks , and @entity11 's trial appears to be no exception			1
" he was so close to having a bullet between his eyes			0
the police were so close , " said @entity94 , who rescued some 15 people from the waters off @entity34 during the massacre			2
but @entity94 told @entity2 that he owes @entity11 only " a punch in the face for firing at me			1
" " he will get the treatment he needs , " @entity94 said			0
experts have given different opinions about @entity11 's sanity , which will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted			1
@entity1 does not have the death penalty , and sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility			0
but @entity11 's defense will try to prove he was sane at the time of the killings , @entity44 said monday			1
@entity44 told reporters after the hearing that the defendant had his reasons , but would not disclose them			0
it is important to @entity11 that he be considered sane , @entity44 said after the hearing			1
prosecutors outlined @entity11 's life before the killings , showing a photo of the messy room where he lived at his mother 's house , listing his six failed businesses and referring to his many hours playing the online game " @entity129			1
" prosecutors said he had " no job , no salary , no money from the government " and was " living off his savings			2
" the defendant smiled briefly when his " warcraft " character was shown , one of the few times he showed emotion on monday			0
he also appeared to be overcome with emotion , fighting back tears , when part of his video manifesto " @entity145 2083 " was played in court			0
@entity44 declined to say why @entity11 wept , citing attorney - client privilege			1
but lawyers for the victims said : " no one thought he was crying for the victims			0
" a survivor of @entity34 , @entity153 , said he was surprised to experience " a strange feeling of relief " when prosecutors switched from listing the names of the dead to those of the wounded			2
" it was an intense gratitude , @entity160 said during a break in the proceedings			0
" it took me by surprise that i felt it , that these wonderful people are still among us , that we managed to save these ones at least			2
" @entity11 is to begin testifying tuesday , and asked monday for his testimony to be broadcast , claiming it as a human right			1
most of the relatives of the victims do not want that to happen , according to lawyers who represent the families of victims and survivors			0
" it 's going to be 10 weeks of hell ... to hear this man , to hear his explanation of why he did it and how he did it , " said @entity186 , whose son was killed on @entity34			2
in november , prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined that @entity11 was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward			1
however , the court sought a second opinion because of the importance of the question of sanity to @entity11 's trial			1
in a report released this month , two court - appointed psychiatric experts said @entity11 was sane at the time of the killings			1
the victims on @entity34 were among 700 mostly young people attending a @entity33 camp , the same camp @entity85 said he had attended every summer since 1974			2
" i think that one of the main messages from @entity1 after the tragedy ... was that we were going to protect our democracy			0
and part of our democracy is the divisions of responsibilities between the government and the courts			0
it 's up to the courts to decide whether this man is going to be sentenced or not , whether he is insane or not			2
it 's not a question which is going to be decided by politicians			0
that 's part of our democratic society , " @entity85 said			0
@entity229 , a terror expert and professor at @entity231 , said @entity11 appears to be overly concerned about his self - image and sees himself in the role of a " fantastic , great person who will save @entity49			2
" " it 's we who should decide what kind of a society we want ; it 's not the terrorists , " he said			0
" and the logic of terrorism is to try to provoke responses to get people to act in ways the terrorists want , and it was important that we did n't do that			2
we did n't go down that road , and that was , i think , a big victory			0
" @entity2 's @entity252 and @entity253 contributed to this report .			0
