-- security issues concerning @entity2 have not become a major issue for @entity5 voters , even after the controversial rocket launch that drew international condemnation last week			1
the most pressing issues for @entity5 at the polls on wednesday , are similar to the ones that dominated @entity12 voters when they cast their ballots in november -- the economy			1
polls showed that @entity17 relations ranked fifth in the most salient issues to the @entity5 public , falling far behind job creation , economic issues and education			1
less than 10 % prioritized relations with @entity24 , according to polls by the @entity26			0
" threat perception overall toward @entity2 has somewhat waned , " said @entity27 , an associate professor of political sciences and international studies at @entity30 in @entity31			2
after the announcement of @entity2 's missile launch , about half of the respondents in a poll said they expected the rocket to have no effect in the election			2
" the best reading of the data suggests that the launch will not have a strong impact on the election , " according to the @entity26 's report			0
" it used to be the case that a major blow from @entity2 would critically affect @entity5 's election			1
however , this may not have a major impact as it used to be , because first of all , we are so used to it , " @entity27 said			0
@entity53 , who has examined the @entity2 factor in @entity5 presidential elections in the last two decades , said he observed that the regime is " less and less important " in this election compared with previous ones			1
" this year , the @entity64 atmosphere is not as strong , " said @entity53 , a phd candidate in the department of @entity5 studies at the university of @entity62			2
after signing an armistice agreement in 1953 , the two neighbors have endured an uneasy truce separated by a demilitarized zone			0
@entity5 have become used to provocation from their neighbor , said @entity27			2
" it 's been going on for the last 20 years , despite so many sporadic skirmishes , virtually nothing has happened , " he said			0
" rather than people worrying about warfare , [ voters ] are much more worried about our welfare			0
" on wednesday , @entity5 voters will choose between the conservative @entity81 's @entity80 , and the left - leaning @entity82			1
if elected , @entity83 would become the first female president of @entity5			1
she is the daughter of former president @entity83 , who stirs mixed feelings among @entity5			1
some claim he was a dictator who stifled opposition ; others credit him with overseeing a key phase of @entity5 's economic development			1
he was shot and killed by his intelligence chief in 1979			0
@entity92 , who served as chief of staff to former late president @entity94 , is a former human rights lawyer			0
he was jailed in the 1970s by @entity83 's father			0
both candidates condemned @entity2 's rocket launch earlier this month			2
but they are expected to pursue a more conciliatory line toward @entity2 than the current president @entity99 , who took an uncompromising approach to dealings with @entity24			1
@entity83 wants dialogue with @entity2 , but her overall plan for engagement remains conditional , while @entity92 favors a transformative approach that promotes @entity108 economic ties as an instrument for engaging @entity2 comprehensively , according to @entity110 , a senior fellow for @entity111 at the @entity112			1
@entity83 's policy of engaging with @entity2 may not differ much from @entity99 's , said @entity114 , manager of international affairs for @entity116 , which covers @entity2			2
even if @entity31 was to implement a policy of unrestricted aid for @entity2 , there is little guarantee that the regime would respond			2
" my personal suspicion is because the @entity2 government is only interested in the welfare of a very small percentage of the people that support the regime , they do n't care as much as people in the outside world might think about aid , " @entity114 said			1
an recent editorial published in the @entity5 newspaper , @entity134 , stated : " both contenders seem to fantasize that inter-korean relations will thaw if one of them takes power			0
" in the months leading up to @entity5 's election , @entity2 's propagandists have occasionally dipped into the race , targeting @entity83			1
in september , a @entity2 government website released a video of a " @entity148 " spoof containing @entity83 's face stuck on a dancing figure			0
the video mocked @entity83 's support for her father whose legacy still divides @entity5			0
set to an upbeat 1960s big band instrumental soundtrack , the video includes images from the era of her father 's rule			0
earlier this month , @entity161 , the official newspaper of @entity2 's ruling @entity162 published seven questions for @entity83 calling her stance on @entity2 " inconsistent , ironic , " according to @entity5 media			1
" my perspective is that @entity2 does n't care about who wins the election , " said @entity114			2
" yes they attack @entity80 and do not attack @entity171 , but that is rhetorical			0
" the bizarre @entity2 actions are more for domestic consumption within its borders and for confusing the world of its intentions , he said .			0

@entity2 security issues do n't *weight* *heavily* on @entity5 voters
@entity5 will elect a new president *december* 19
polls show @entity5 prioritize economic issues , education ahead of @entity2
