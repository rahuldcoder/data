-- it 's said nothing is certain in life except for death and taxes			0
for @entity8 football clubs it 's a new punitive tax law that 's worrying them to death			1
they fear one of @entity13 's top leagues , newly resurgent following significant investment from mega wealthy @entity15 and @entity16 , could be irreparably damaged by the tax			1
on thursday , @entity8 president @entity18 told a delegation of professional @entity8 football club leaders he would n't abandon the government 's plan for a 75 % tax on salaries reaching more than a $ 1.35 million			1
the clubs have been lobbying hard against the tax , arguing it endangers their future			0
it 's estimated the tax could increase their costs by up to 30 %			0
and they feel so strongly over the matter that they plan to go on strike			0
so if you 're a @entity8 football fan do n't expect to be watching the likes @entity40 striker @entity39 or @entity41 forward @entity42 in action between 29 november and 2 december			1
if it goes ahead it would @entity8 's first football " strike " since 1972			0
@entity39 is one of more than 10 players at @entity15 - owned @entity40 -- @entity8 's richest club -- whose yearly pay exceeds $ 1.35 million			1
while the average @entity53 player 's salary is estimated at just under $ 800,000 , @entity39 reportedly takes home $ 17.5 million a year			2
many players would already be taxed at @entity8 's top marginal rate of 49 % , which kicks in at $ 675,000 a year			1
just for @entity39 's hefty pay packet alone , @entity40 's costs would increase by nearly $ 12 million under the @entity18 plan			1
since world - class players have their choice of what countries they play in , @entity8 teams would have to absorb the increased taxes themselves if they want to attract top talent			0
ahead of this weekend 's games , @entity40 and @entity41 are joint top of @entity53			2
but @entity40 could be at a further disadvantage in future given @entity41 are exempt from @entity8 taxation laws and the principality club 's tax expenditure would be $ 67.5 million less than the @entity8 champions per year			1
" the high - income tax of 75 % , which was included in the 2013 draft budget of @entity8 , will have a disastrous effect on the competitiveness of @entity8 football , " said the @entity73 of @entity74 ( @entity75 ) in a statement			1
before the start of the season some of the world 's best players -- like @entity86 who joined @entity40 from @entity87 -- if the taxation impasse remains , it is likely @entity8 clubs would struggle to attract the very top talent			2
" @entity8 teams will be at a disadvantage with regard to @entity96 clubs who only pay 40 % tax , " former @entity41 chief executive @entity92 told @entity0			1
" that will affect the standard of the league			0
it might also affect money coming into @entity8 football from foreign investment --- potential owners might be tempted to get more value for money elsewhere			2
" @entity41 and @entity40 have raised the popularity and exposure of @entity8 football outside @entity8 , " added @entity92			1
" some in @entity8 are still quite skeptical as to why and how they have got involved , but if you are supporter or if you enjoy watching @entity8 football they have brought only positive dimensions			2
" as an international observer , it is going to be difficult to uphold the current standard in the years to come if this tax comes in to play			0
" @entity8 football has a strong tradition of developing young players through its academy system , but a @entity8 club has n't won the @entity121 -- @entity13 's top competition -- for over 20 years , though last season @entity40 reached the quarterfinals			1
" in the short term clubs would have to buy cheaper players for lower transfers and would pay lower salaries to avoid paying the 75 % , " said @entity92 as he outlined a grim future for @entity8 football			1
" when the player reaches a level where he starts to attract offers from abroad and will attract wages far above â ‚ ¬ 1 million , or when a player becomes an international or starts to play well in @entity135 competition then there is no other option for him than to move abroad			0
" @entity92 added : " what is a concern for the clubs is that their budgets relate to long - term contracts they have already agreed with players			0
" they feel the goalposts have been moved and it makes it extremely difficult for them to continue or plan to be successful in an environment that is already very challenging			0
" earlier this week @entity75 president @entity153 unveiled a study outlining the economic benefits @entity8 football brings @entity8 , given it has an annual turnover of $ 5.8 billion and there are potentially 25,000 jobs at stake			1
" the return on investment for the state is $ .5 billion " , said @entity153 , who is also the president of second division club @entity161			0
" in addition , each euro generated by clubs creates additional 2.5 euros ( $ 3.38 ) in the country 's economy			0
" a survey by pollster @entity171 in october suggested 85 % of voters did not think football clubs should be exempted from the high tax rate , which requires approval from the @entity8 parliament			1
and given @entity8 's economic problems -- it has only just emerged from recession -- some members of the @entity8 football community remain uneasy about the proposed strike			2
" i think that if our corporation goes on strike , we 'll have to go into hiding , i mean really go into hiding , " @entity185 coach @entity184 , was quoted in @entity186 as telling radio station @entity187			0
" i 'm not totally for ( the strike ) personally , what worries me of course is that there is this tax , but , all @entity8 people suffer from having to pay taxes			0
" i just do n't understand the anger from the club presidents ; i just do n't get it at all			0
" it is not all bad news for @entity8 football fans given some observers expect a compromise to be reached			2
" i remain confident that some sort of solution will be found before the date of the strike voted for by the club 's chairmen , " @entity208 , a @entity8 football expert and writer for @entity210 , told @entity0 .			2
