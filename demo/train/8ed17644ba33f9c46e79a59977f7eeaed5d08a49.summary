-- @entity1 is potentially just a week away from becoming only the third @entity3 driver to win four consecutive world titles , but outside of the @entity8 's continued dominance the big talking point of sunday 's @entity6 was another ugly tire issue			1
for the second time this year , @entity3 's official supplier @entity10 has been forced to explain a potentially dangerous blowout during a race			1
several incidents at june 's @entity15 @entity6 forced the @entity17 company to strengthen its compounds amid threats of a driver strike if safety was not improved , and the issue has come to light again after @entity24 had to wrestle for control of his @entity26 after the right - front tire fell to bits			1
" i 'd done 21 laps with that set , when , all of a sudden , the front - right just exploded , destroying the front win , " said the @entity29 , who also suffered blowouts at @entity32 in practice and during the race			2
" it was lucky , because there were n't any other cars around me			0
" @entity10 motorsport director @entity42 defended the tires			1
" it was a big flat spot that put a huge hole right the way through the tread			0
there 's not a lot we can do about that one , " said @entity42 , whose firm will again be @entity3 's sole supplier next year			2
" it was a big lockup and he just burned this huge hole which lost air , and when tires do that , all sorts of things can happen			2
so we 've absolutely no fears going forward			0
" @entity61 's @entity60 , however , voiced his disapproval			0
" the drivers are n't super important , it is what other people want , " said the 37 - year - old , whose race was ended when his car burst into flames after being hit by the @entity67 of @entity68			1
" the tyres are wearing a lot and they also explode a bit , but that is for @entity10 to sort out , " the @entity73 added			1
" @entity10 will also put the puncture of @entity24 down to a lockup , but the reason the drivers are locking up is because there is no tread left			1
" @entity1 was able to clinch his fourth successive race victory , avoiding the chaos and tense battles going on behind him despite twice being held up when the safety car was brought out after the @entity24 and @entity60 incidents			1
he led from pole position to notch up the 34th win of his career as he closes in on the 41 of @entity94 , who is third on the all - time list			0
" this track , it 's known that the limit is the front - right ( tire )			0
we saw it the previous years , and basically it 's good to have the team on the radio warning you -- because obviously you see what 's going on , the tire grains immediately and then kind of stabilizes , " said @entity1 , who now has a 77 - point lead over @entity101			0
" but when it stops graining basically there 's nothing left and that 's quite dangerous because it 's quite likely to have a big lockup			2
you have a flat spot , which could end with pitting the stint earlier than you want or having a tire puncture			0
" so yeah , they were quite worried , similar to last year			0
i thought i had it more or less in control but obviously it 's good to communicate			0
" the @entity8 will join @entity126 and @entity127 in the history books if he wins next weekend 's @entity129 @entity6 and @entity101 is no higher than ninth			1
the @entity131 finished sixth in @entity132 after tangling with @entity133 near the start -- while @entity101 lost a place , his @entity137 teammate was left at the back of the field before battling back to claim ninth ahead of @entity24			1
@entity1 's main threats ended up being the @entity143 duo @entity142 and @entity144 , who claimed second and third			0
@entity147 's @entity146 provided much of the day 's entertainment with an impressive drive to take fourth place ahead of @entity152 ' @entity151 , another driver to complain about the tires after losing 16 seconds in the space of just six laps			1
" after the second safety car , we lost out in traction to the @entity147 , " said @entity151 , who dropped to fourth overall below @entity142			1
" it was a nice battle with @entity101 at the end , but it 's hard to take when it 's only for @entity164 or @entity165			0
it was just not a good race for us , but we have the chance to bounce back in @entity169			2
" the 2008 world champion 's teammate @entity170 was seventh ahead of @entity26 's @entity173 , putting @entity152 a point behind second - placed @entity137 in the constructors ' standings -- which @entity61 leads by 118 points			2
" @entity1 is a very long way off in terms of points , and we can not expect miracles between now and the end of the championship , " said @entity101 , who had also criticized the tires following saturday 's qualifying			1
" second place in the constructors ' championship is probably a more realistic target , but one thing is certain , we are not giving up now and we will give it our best shot right to the very end			2
" @entity1 has won for the last three years in @entity194 and the previous race on the calendar , @entity197			1
he now heads to a @entity169 circuit where he has triumphed three of the last four times			0
" the car is working ... it 's on the edge , to be honest , more so than you would probably think from the outside , but it 's obviously nice when you get the results like @entity197 or this weekend , " he said			0
" i look forward to @entity129 because it 's one of the nicest tracks of the whole season			1
it 's the best track in the world , with the fans completely crazy in a positive way			0
" they 're big fans of motorsport , very passionate , so i 'm very much looking forward to one of the highlights of the season			0
