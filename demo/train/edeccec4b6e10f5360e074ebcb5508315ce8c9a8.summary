-- @entity1 may be agonizingly tight - lipped about the juicy details of @entity3 and @entity5 's honeymoon , except that they 're somewhere in the @entity7			1
but not everyone 's quite so discreet			1
@entity9 is an archipelago of 115 islands in the @entity11 , 16 of which offers hotels and resorts for tourists			2
with a population of around 87,000 people , @entity9 has the smallest population of any @entity20 state			2
the nation is famed for its natural beauty and eco-tourism			0
@entity9 ' @entity24 , which is home to the world 's largest population of giant tortoises , and @entity28 , which has remained unchanged since prehistoric times , are @entity30			1
here are five places , in descending order of honeymoon - likeliness , that have been touted as potential royal rendezvous			1
@entity35 likelihood of a @entity38 and @entity5 honeymoon : 8/10 following @entity9 tourism minister @entity42 's admission that the couple is spending their honeymoon on the tropical island , @entity40 real estate magnate @entity39 told @entity40 newspaper @entity47 that he rented @entity35 to the couple			1
the royal newlyweds would no doubt be attracted to @entity35 for its privacy and green credentials			1
@entity35 , one of the @entity54 of the @entity9 archipelago , is occupied by 11 villas made by @entity58 and @entity59 craftsmen			1
each of them is equipped with plunge pools , gazebos and private butlers , but the most profligate of them all is the 8,000 - square - foot @entity65 11 , which is almost twice is large as the island 's other villas , and comes with circular - flow swimming pool and a private cinema			1
given @entity38 ' love of the wild , he will also love the resort 's conservation policies			1
before the island was sold to the @entity78 family during the 1970s , the island was colonized by pests and alien plant species left over from its days as a coconut plantation			0
indigenous trees and birds have been re-introduced these days			0
cost : an average honeymoon for two costs £ 3,220 ( $ 5,280 ) , whereas renting all the island 's villas costs a staggering £ 43,000 ( $ 69,700 ) -- a price tag that does n't seem to faze @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , all of whom reportedly holidayed there			1
@entity98 likelihood of a @entity38 and @entity5 honeymoon : 6/10 some tabloids like @entity102 are speculating that the royal honeymoon will include a " nostalgic excursion to @entity98			1
" in august 2007 , following a temporary break - up , the couple spent a week in @entity98 , which is only accessible by plane from the main island of @entity109			1
the experience was romantic enough for them to decide to soldier on with their relationship			0
the resort certainly seemed to impress @entity3			1
he allegedly told islanders that it was the best vacation he has ever had			0
@entity98 consists of 20 suites and 28 villas , scattered over the island 's 14 kilometers of un-spoilt beaches			1
the island has enough facilities to satisfy all hot - blooded young couples , such as diving hotspots , bike trails , fly fishing , tennis courts , sea kayaks and surfing			0
and they 'd be sharing it all with onlookers they probably do n't mind -- the 150 green turtles that call the island home			2
cost : rates of a beach suite per night starts at € 1,100 ( $ 1,580 ) per person for one night during high season			0
@entity143 private likelihood of a @entity38 and @entity5 honeymoon : 4/10 before word got out that the couple had chosen @entity35 , most thought they had gone for @entity149			1
with only 17 villas , @entity143 is almost as exclusive as @entity35			1
non-residents are banned from visiting the island			0
the island is fringed by seven beaches , one of which is a hawksbill turtle nesting ground			0
their spa , perched on top of a cliff , uses oils and pastes made from island - grown ingredients			0
the island 's vigorous conservation programs should impress the eco-minded prince			2
almost 80 percent of @entity143 's surface area has been restored to its original flora and fauna			1
the island also claims to have rejuvenated the populations of @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 on the island			0
cost : rates for a one bedroom villa starts at € 2,950 ( $ 4,230 ) per person per night during high season			0
@entity9 likelihood of a @entity38 and @entity5 honeymoon : 2/10 since @entity7 opened in 2006 , it 's been subjected to a lot of press -- perhaps too much press for the low - key - loving newlyweds			1
the resort continues to feature on hot travel lists in publications around the globe , the latest being the @entity196 2011			0
here 's why : it 's regarded by some as the first top - notch resort to appear on the main island of @entity109 , its native @entity201 cooks meals with the wow factor ( bat curry , anyone ? ) , and its @entity207 spa is regarded by @entity208 as " the most spoiling set - up in @entity9			2
" its 4.8 - hectare garden was named the best in @entity20 in 2008			0
the only reason the resort is not flooded with rubbernecks is because it only has 30 villas , dispersed over a 12 - hectare hill top			0
each member of staff is trained in yoga and meditation to deal with hissy fits from diva customers			0
that said , given @entity109 houses 90 percent of the country 's population , the resort is probably not secluded enough for the royal couple			2
rates : @entity65 rentals start at € 1,590 ( $ 2,280 )			0
@entity228 likelihood of a @entity38 and @entity5 honeymoon : 1/10 @entity228 probably has the last word in exclusivity in @entity9			1
the tiny island , situated 1,600 kilometers from @entity234 , only has four villas			0
it 's only accessible by helicopter , and hotel management encourages guests to rent out the whole 25 - hectare island			2
guests are encouraged to volunteer in the resort 's conservation projects , from tree - planting to monitoring endangered sea turtles			2
endemic plants take up 95 percent of the island 's vegetation			2
with carbon footprint kept to such a minimum , it 's little wonder that the resort frequently wins green tourism awards			1
it also has the standard facilities that its competitors offer , including a spa , deep sea fishing and a myriad of water sports			0
but it 's not quite as opulent as some of the other resorts available to the couple , so we have this one down as an ' if all others fail ' entry			2
cost : @entity65 rental costs € 1,200 ( $ 1,720 ) per night , and the entire island can be rented out for € 4,500			0
@entity272 © 2011 @entity273 @entity274			0

@entity3 and @entity5 's honeymoon is taking place somewhere in the @entity7
the most likely spot , @entity35 , is attractive for its privacy and green credentials
*possibilities* : @entity98 , @entity143 , @entity7 , @entity228
