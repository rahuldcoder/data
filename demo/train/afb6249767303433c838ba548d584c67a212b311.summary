-- you could see it in his eyes			1
even before @entity5 spoke his first words to the throngs in @entity8 , you could look into his eyes and sense the wonder			1
the world was looking at him			2
but he was looking at something , too : at all those upturned faces			2
at all the eyes staring back at him			1
nothing can possibly prepare a person for such a sight			2
in this life , there are moments , and then there are moments			0
the first appearance of a new pope on the balcony of @entity27 has always been a moment like no other			1
before there was telegraphy , before there was radio , before there was television , before there was the @entity37 , before there was @entity39 , the vision -- the solemn orchestration -- of a newly elected pope stepping onto the balcony was the most dramatic possible way of bringing huge news to the world			1
opinion : @entity5 , open up the church " i would like to thank you for your embrace , " the new pope said , gazing out at all those eyes			1
when authors and orators have searched for ways to express the ultimate example of reverential exaltation , the periodically repeated scene in @entity8 , down through the centuries , has often been the one they have turned to			0
@entity65 , in his book " @entity64 , " about the original @entity63 astronauts , wanted to describe for readers just what level of devotion the newly named astronauts had received from the @entity71 people			0
the seven pilots had been just that -- fighter pilots , test pilots -- before being selected for the space program			0
suddenly , they were something else			0
people would see them and begin crying			0
@entity65 came up with the one ideal analogy to portray the phenomenon : " the boys would n't have minded the following			0
they would n't have minded appearing once a year on a balcony over a huge square in which half the world is assembled			1
the world roars its approval , its applause , and breaks into a thirty - minute storm of cheers and tears			0
... a little adulation on the order of the @entity5 's ; that 's all the @entity96 at the top of the pyramid really wanted			1
" opinion : @entity5 , humble , authentic and credible but humility is not required of fighter pilots and astronauts			0
nor is it required of rock stars or professional athletes or any of the many other public performers , in disparate venues , who are regularly introduced with carefully planned and marketed majesty designed to elevate them in the eyes of their audiences			1
a pope is different , and his introduction to the world is like no other			1
when wednesday morning dawned in @entity118 , a man named @entity5 was one of millions of people preparing to commence the new day			0
by the time the day was over , he was no longer @entity5 , and he was no longer one of millions			0
as @entity5 , he stepped onto that balcony and was greeted by that sight			2
from behind his eyeglasses , he took it all in			0
the eyes of the world met his			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity131 .			1

@entity131 : before radio , tv , pope 's appearance was most dramatic way to *announce* news
new pope 's appearance on the balcony of @entity27 is a moment like no other , he says
@entity131 : you could see the *impact* of the moment in the pope 's eyes
