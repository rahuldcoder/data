-- last week @entity1 levied a fine against @entity3 for one of the biggest wiretapping violations in history			1
the fine ? less than $ 200,000			1
@entity3 's net profits in 2012 ? more than $ 10 billion			1
imagine a driver of a fancy car caught for speeding and then asked to pay a nickel			0
over several years and in countries around the world , @entity3 drove cars with cameras mounted on the roof through communities and residential neighborhoods			2
@entity3 said that it was gathering images to improve its " @entity22 " mapping program			1
but @entity3 was also secretly collecting information about internet access points in private homes and intercepting personal communications across wi - fi networks			1
a privacy official in @entity1 had suspected that this was happening , but was repeatedly reassured by @entity3 that it was n't			1
when the official actually removed the hard drive from a @entity3 vehicle , the true story came out			2
investigations were launched in more than a dozen countries			0
" @entity22 " became " @entity36			0
" the @entity38 privacy commissioner determined that the company had obtained medical records and financial records , private e-mails and passwords			2
in the @entity46 , a group of attorneys general levied a $ 7 million fine against the company , after federal agencies in @entity49 failed to act			1
@entity3 apologized , stopped collecting the wi - fi data ( but not the location data ) and promised to improve its privacy practices			1
last week , the @entity1 official who triggered the original investigation announced the 145,000 - euro fine , almost the largest amount allowed under @entity58 law , though insignificant for a company the size of @entity3			1
the public official was clearly unhappy about the outcome and told the @entity63 , " as long as violations of data protection law are penalized with such insignificant sums , the ability of existing laws to protect personal privacy in the digital world , with its high potential for abuse , is barely possible			1
" as the public concern about privacy is increasing , the failure of public agencies to take forceful action is becoming a problem			1
in the @entity46 , the @entity79 announced important settlements with @entity81 and @entity3 back in 2011 , but it has been reluctant to take any meaningful enforcement action since			1
even after @entity3 consolidated all of the data from across its 60 plus services last year into one data policy to " rule them all , " the @entity79 remained silent			2
the @entity88 launched an investigation of @entity22 but levied only a $ 25,000 fine , even less than the amount in @entity1 , and that was for @entity3 's obstruction during the investigation			1
increasingly , @entity96 companies are advocating " self - regulation " and weak - willed politicians are telling users , " check your privacy settings , be careful what you post			2
" in other words , you are on your own			0
that is terrible advice coming from those who know that users can do little to protect their data			0
user data is gathered surreptitiously , few users have the ability or time to know how it is collected , and even good privacy policies change quickly			2
it was only mr. @entity115 's persistence that made it possible to challenge @entity3 's data collection practices			1
it would have been impossible for those whose wi - fi communications were intercepted to know that their data was gathered by @entity3 , let alone enforce privacy rights against the company			1
that is why it is important for officials to pursue investigations , enforce laws and impose significant penalties when warranted			0
the failure to enforce privacy laws is bad not only for @entity96 users , but also for smaller companies and innovative firms that are developing services that comply with privacy law			1
the success of " @entity138 , " and other new approaches , depends on countries enforcing their laws			0
if they see their larger competitors get away with cutting corners , the message will be that they , too , can ignore the laws			0
this will lead to a vicious spiral that governments must avoid			0
in @entity58 , governments recognize the need to update and strengthen privacy laws			2
efforts are under way to improve privacy protections			0
that will help consumers and internet users all around the world as companies adopt better safeguards for personal data			0
in the @entity46 , president @entity163 has called for a @entity164 and recommended the adoption of new privacy law			0
it is a good , forward - looking proposal that builds on existing law and addresses a key concern of internet users today			0
another proposal now in @entity172 would give internet users the right to know the information private firms collect about them			0
it is a clever approach to privacy that does not restrict data collection ; it simply makes companies more accountable to users			2
but it is not easy to enact new laws , particularly when large companies have so much influence over the political process			2
still , there are many public officials who must share the frustration of mr. @entity115			0
privacy protection without enforcement is no protection at all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

@entity196 : @entity1 levied small fine on @entity3 for gathering *people* 's private info
@entity202 was less than $ 200,000 . @entity3 made $ 10 billion in 2010 . fine has no teeth , he says
public agencies failing to strengthen laws on companies that *threaten* privacy , he says
@entity196 : @entity212 a good step toward enforcement
