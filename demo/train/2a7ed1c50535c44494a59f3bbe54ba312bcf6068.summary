@entity0 -- stressing the unbreakable ties between their nations , @entity3 president @entity2 and @entity5 prime minister @entity4 called tuesday for direct talks between @entity5 and the @entity9 while agreeing that the international community is strengthening efforts to isolate @entity12 over its nuclear ambitions			1
the two leaders spoke to reporters after meeting for more than an hour at the @entity16 , twice shaking hands for the cameras as part of an effort to dispel the notion that relations between the @entity3 and @entity5 have frayed in recent months			0
@entity2 said the bond between the @entity3 and @entity5 is " unbreakable " and added that his country remains " unwavering in our commitment to @entity5 's security			1
" @entity4 chose to paraphrase @entity3 humorist @entity30 by noting that reports of the demise of @entity3 - @entity5 relations " are n't just premature , they 're just flat wrong			1
" the meeting , their fifth since @entity4 took office last spring , focused on revitalizing the @entity38 peace process as well as discussing other issues , including efforts to prevent @entity12 from developing a nuclear arsenal			1
both @entity2 and @entity4 stressed the importance of moving toward direct talks between @entity5 and @entity9			1
presently , @entity4 and @entity45 president @entity44 are n't talking directly , but communicating through @entity3 @entity38 envoy @entity46 , who serves as a go - between for negotiations			1
@entity4 said tuesday that he is ready for direct talks -- a step he has repeatedly endorsed in the past -- and indicated that progress in the peace process is coming			1
" the president and i discussed concrete steps that could be done now -- in the coming days , in the coming weeks -- to move the peace process further along in a very robust way , " @entity4 said			1
@entity44 has refused to meet with @entity4 until @entity5 promises to stop building settlements , but said last month after meeting with @entity2 that direct talks were the goal			1
@entity5 's settlement policy has become a friction point between @entity5 and the @entity3 , with relations reaching a low point in march when @entity5 announced plans during a visit by vice president @entity66 to construct more than 1,000 new houses in @entity68			0
the announcement outraged the @entity2 administration and led to the @entity9 ' withdrawing from agreed - upon indirect negotiations with @entity5			2
in a visit later in march to the @entity3 , @entity4 was presented with a set of concessions that the @entity16 wanted to see @entity5 make in an effort to restart the negotiations			2
neither government detailed what the exact nature of the concessions were , but sources on both sides said a halt in @entity68 construction was among the demands from the @entity2 administration			0
neither leader mentioned settlements in their comments tuesday or their responses to questions from reporters			0
however , @entity2 commended @entity5 for easing limits on goods going to @entity94 , saying there had been " real progress on the ground " that was happening " more quickly and more effectively than many people anticipated			0
" the president said the @entity3 wants to " ensure the people of @entity94 are able to prosper economically while @entity5 is able to maintain its legitimate security needs in not allowing missiles and weapons to get to @entity103			2
" in may , @entity5 's controversial embargo blocking the flow of goods into @entity94 turned deadly when @entity5 forces stormed a vessel that was part of a @entity94 - bound humanitarian flotilla , resulting in the deaths of nine @entity112 activists			0
aside from @entity5 - @entity45 relations , many @entity5 worry about @entity12 's intentions with its nuclear program			2
@entity4 noted that recent sanctions adopted by the @entity117 are helping to delegitimize @entity12 's nuclear program			0
the sanctions " have teeth " and " bite , " @entity4 asserted , noting that the @entity3 also has adopted more of its own sanctions against @entity12			0
" how much do you need to bite is something i can not answer now , but if other nations adopted similar sanctions , that would increase the effect , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .			0
