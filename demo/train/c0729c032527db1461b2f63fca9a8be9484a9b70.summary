a former two - term governor of @entity2 , @entity0 narrowly won election to the @entity23 in 2000 and easily won re-election in 2006			1
his departure increases the difficulty for @entity1 to retain their @entity23 majority next year			2

" @entity65 , the former long - time spokesman for @entity23 majority leader @entity66 , @entity67 , said @entity0 was often a " thorn in @entity66 's side			2
" however , @entity65 said @entity66 " always respected the fact that @entity0 was trying to do what was best for @entity2			1
" according to the @entity23 @entity1 leadership aide , @entity66 and sen. @entity72 , @entity67 - @entity73 , tried to convince @entity0 to stay in @entity74 after @entity0 told a local newspaper a few weeks ago he was still deciding on whether to run			1
" over the last several weeks , there were intense conversations with @entity66 and @entity72 trying to make @entity0 understand how needed he was and how valued he is as a member of the caucus , " the @entity23 aide said			0
" ultimately they understood that this is a personal decision			0
" a @entity1 strategist who spoke on condition of not being identified characterized @entity0 's decision as disloyal to the party			1
" he typically takes the easy way out , " the strategist said			0
" the party has stood by him , but when the going gets tough , he abandons the party			0
" in his statement , @entity0 called for " those who will follow in my footsteps to look for common ground and to work together in bipartisan ways to do what 's best for the country , not just one political party			2
" " public office is a place for public service , not personal profit , " @entity0 's statement said			1
" it 's about promoting the common good , not the agenda of the radical right or the radical left			0
it 's about fairness for all , not privileges for the few			0
and , it 's about protecting the rights of individuals , even if it angers the majority			0
