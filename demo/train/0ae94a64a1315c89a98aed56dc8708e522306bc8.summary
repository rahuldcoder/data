-- on august 15 , @entity4 allegedly walked into the @entity5 in @entity6 , a conservative think tank , and shot the building manager @entity8 in the arm , saying something along the lines of , " i do n't like your politics , " as he did so			2
despite his gunshot wound , police say , @entity8 was able to tackle @entity4 and wrestle his weapon away before he could harm anyone else			2
( @entity4 pleaded not guilty when he was indicted			2
) @entity4 was volunteering at a @entity6 community center for lesbian , gay and transgender individuals and his parents said their son had " strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner			0
" the @entity5 promotes the view that homosexuality is harmful to society			0
three years earlier , also in @entity6 , rabid anti-semite @entity31 was charged with shooting and killing @entity34 security officer @entity33			1
he died while in custody			0
opinion : after 9/11 , how we honored our son 's memory the shootings at the @entity34 and @entity5 underlined the fact that acts of political violence against civilians , commonly referred to as terrorism , can be carried out by those espousing many different types of ideology			2
in fact , since the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people at the @entity52 and @entity53 11 years ago , 19 people have died in terrorist attacks in the @entity56 that were motivated by ideologies that have nothing to do with the ideas of @entity60 , but rather were the victims of terrorists motivated by extreme anti-government views or virulent anti-semitic / neo-nazi views			1
jihadist terrorists , on the other hand , have killed 17 people , according to data compiled by the @entity69 from thousands of news reports and court documents			2
( " @entity73 " terrorists are defined in this database as those associated with or motivated by @entity76 , or its affiliates or like - minded groups			1
) there have been 10 deadly attacks in the @entity56 by nonjihadist extremists since 9/11 compared to just four by jihadists			1
( one of those incidents was at @entity85 , @entity86 , in 2009 in which 13 were killed			0
) the @entity69 study suggests that law enforcement 's tendency to regard @entity92 - @entity56 communities as the most likely source of terrorism risks missing the threat from other extremists			1
since 9/11 , jihadist and nonjihadist terrorists have killed about the same number of people in the @entity56 , yet 61 % of the 337 people indicted for terrorism - related activities since the 9/11 attacks are jihadists , according to the @entity69 data			1
revisiting the mosque at @entity105 since 2009 and 2010 there has been a sharp drop in the number of jihadist defendants , which peaked at 43 and 34 respectively			0
this year the number of jihadist defendants has dropped to 7 , suggesting that the threat from these kinds of terrorists is receding			2
the spike in jihadist terrorism defendants in 2009 and 2010 was itself largely due to the indictment of a ring of men in @entity120 conspiring to send themselves and others to @entity122 in order to fight on behalf of the @entity76 linked militant group @entity124			0
nine of the 43 jihadists indicted in 2009 were involved in plans to send fighters to @entity122 , and 18 of the 34 jihadists indicted in 2010 were also part of this network			0
@entity56 authorities have recently come under fire for purportedly discriminatory counterterrorism tactics , such as the unjustified monitoring of mosques and cafes frequented by @entity138 and the inclusion of language in @entity142 documents and textbooks that stereotypes or presents factually incorrect information about @entity138			1
of course , 9/11 rightly brought great law enforcement focus on possible jihadist terrorists			1
but the @entity69 's data tends to support the view that law enforcement is more likely to target suspected @entity92 militants than other extremists			1
although authorities are just as likely to use information provided by a confidential informant in the investigation of both jihadist and nonjihadist terrorist suspects , they are far more likely to place an undercover agent with a suspected jihadist terrorist suspect than a right - wing or left - wing extremist			0
an overwhelming 78 % of the terrorism - related indictments that relied on an undercover agent were jihadist cases			0
of the 16 people who have been indicted since 2001 on terrorism - related weapons charges after some sort of sting operation in which the weapons were provided by the @entity56 government , 75 % were jihadists			1
yet the data indicates that nonjihadist terrorists are actually much more likely to have acquired weapons			2
since 2001 , 64 % of the 127 people indicted on terrorism - related weapons charges were nonjihadist terrorists , such as @entity179 , one of four @entity182 soldiers indicted in june for allegedly amassing $ 87,000 worth of guns and bomb parts that they planned to use in terrorist attacks against their home base of @entity188 , @entity189 , and a park in nearby @entity191 , @entity189			1
belief : atheists continue battle against @entity52 cross at memorial just last month , seven people , including two with links to the militant anti-government @entity199 movement , were indicted in connection with the shooting of four police officers in @entity203 , @entity204 , two of whom were killed			0
authorities say @entity208 allegedly opened fire with an assault rifle on a policeman directing traffic , and then led cops on a high - speed chase that ended at a trailer park , where others were waiting			0
the two officers were killed in the ensuing gunfight			0
( @entity208 has pleaded not guilty			0
) additionally , the @entity69 found that no jihadist terrorists have acquired or even attempted to acquire chemical and biological weapons since 9/11 , while 11 anarchist , white supremacist or right - wing extremists have been indicted for possessing such materials , and another four were indicted for attempting to produce them			1
some politicians and much of the public continue to believe that the threat from terrorists comes from violent jihadists , when in reality far - right extremists pose as much or possibly even more of a threat , something that we would do well to consider on the 11th anniversary of 9/11			1
( thanks to @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , and @entity242 for their research help			0

in 11 years since *september* 11 , 2001 , sources of terror in @entity56 have been *diverse*
@entity249 : terrorists *unaffiliated* with jihadi groups have taken a toll
he says law enforcement naturally focused on jihadi groups after 9/11 but should *broaden* scope
