@entity0 , @entity1 on the principal 's desk at the @entity0 's @entity5 sits a screen beaming surveillance video from around the campus			1
in one of the desk 's drawers , within easy reach of @entity11 's right hand , lies a fully loaded pistol			0
a teacher for 15 years , @entity11 argues that bringing a gun to school reassures his students , who are still terrified after a brazen attack on the @entity21 and @entity22 in december , when @entity24 militants stormed the building and massacred dozens of students during a six - hour siege			1
" they would look to the door every time they heard a sound			0
now when they see me wearing a gun , they need not worry and can focus on the task at hand , which is to educate themselves , " @entity11 says			0
barbed wire , surveillance cameras and snipers have become a common sight in the schools of this @entity1 city			1
private schools in the province of @entity47 , which lies along @entity1 's northwest frontier , have been instructed by the government to arrange security guards and metal detectors			1
school officials remain tight - lipped about the threats they 've received from militants , but stories have emerged of empty coffins being sent to principals as an ominous suggestion of the danger that could lie ahead			1
after the brutal attack , @entity1 @entity24 spokesman @entity60 told @entity2 the bloodshed was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen during repeated army operations in provinces including @entity68 , @entity69 and the @entity70			1
last month , the provincial government pledged to spend seven billion rupees ( $ 69 million ) on enhancing security at government run schools in @entity74			0
however , @entity76 information minister @entity75 says it is still not enough prevent in an attack on the 35,000 government - run schools in the province			0
so , in an extraordinary measure , the @entity76 government has allowed teachers with firearm licenses to keep guns at school			1
@entity87 , a mild mannered primary school teacher who has been a member of the @entity88 of @entity0 's @entity89 for more than 20 years , is shocked by the decision			1
" why would you glorify guns ? " he asks			2
" if teachers take guns into classroom it glorifies this deadly weapon in the eyes of children , and in the future it could inspire them to seek out guns , misuse them and cause more tragedies to take place			1
" " teachers are meant to teach , " he adds			2
at a shooting range in @entity0 , the @entity47 police force has started basic weapon training sessions for teachers interested in learning how to use firearms			1
@entity110 , a police superintendent , says that one of the reasons given for arming teachers is so they can hold militants at bay during a potential attack until security forces arrive			2
around 20 female teachers have already received training from inspector @entity120			2
most had never held a gun before			0
" the tragedy of december 16 has emboldened these women , " @entity120 tells @entity2			2
" most of them were mothers and they were helpless then -- they will be never helpless again			0
" regardless of the day 's training , @entity110 says none of the teachers involved have expressed interest in obtaining a gun license			2
back at the principal 's office , @entity11 places the gun on his desk and shares his experience of volunteering at hospitals on the day of the attack			0
his eyes tear up as he recalls seeing schoolboys as young as 12 with bullet wounds that would not be uncommon on a battlefield			0
he brushes away those who criticize the decision to bring in guns to schools , saying " these are extraordinary times and we must deal with them in extraordinary ways			0
" after what i have seen i refuse to be helpless and unarmed if anyone comes in to attack my students the way [ the militants ] did in december			1
" we were once warriors of the chalk and the blackboard			0
now we must be soldiers at war and fight for the cause of education and a brighter future for our children			0

follows december school massacre which killed *145* people , including dozens of students
