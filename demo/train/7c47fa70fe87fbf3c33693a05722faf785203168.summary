i should sing opera because i had an interesting voice			1
i said : " oh my gosh , no ! these fat ladies singing on stage ! " she gave me two @entity10 , i listened to them and i started to sing the high notes			2
i started to hear the orchestra and the emotion -- and the power to express so many different feelings through voice , through instruments , through feelings			2
this talent i have got , i had to develop it , because it was a burning flame in my heart			2
when it started , i knew			2
i do n't know how to explain it			0
maybe different people feel that with love -- you just know it ! i felt that with music and opera			1
@entity34 , @entity35 , there are so many great @entity37 singers , but from my little town in the north , i think i was the first one			1
i come from @entity40 in the north of @entity37			1
the city i am from is called @entity43			0
my parents are very proud of me and so are other people in our little town			0
so i worked through the summers so i could get professional singing lessons and then i got into the music academy in @entity51 where i studied for six years			0
when i finished at the music academy , @entity53 from the @entity54 heard about me from a critic			1
he sent me an email ( saying ) that he wanted to hear my voice and from that moment on everything changed			0
i do n't know the details about what the critic wrote -- it must have been something that made him curious			1
more from @entity66 : @entity68 's first female olympic gold medalist @entity67 the difference between one singer and another is of , course , the talent he or she got from nature			1
the color of the voice , yes you could say that , but the most unique thing , the thing that makes a difference , is sincerity			0
it 's not that easy to open yourself to the audience -- to be sincere , to open your soul , to say , " this is me with my talent , my insecurities , with everything i am			1
" of course , technique is important too , but there are lots of singers with good technique who do n't take enough time , maybe , to develop the other part -- the sensitivity			1
my technique is not perfect all the time -- if i am not sleeping enough or having problems and too many thoughts			0
you ca n't force your voice to sound the same all the time because lots of exterior things influence your resonance and your energy , and all that feeds into your voice			1
the voice is a very sensitive instrument			0
it 's not that easy , it 's not just going out there and singing and your voice comes out			1
it would be so easy if it was like that			0
can you imagine how hard it is without a microphone to have the force and the power to sound through an orchestra of 80 people playing loud music ? that 's not normal , right ? you have to be patient and focused and to love what you do and to understand there are lots of moments where you feel very down			1
as an opera singer you have to understand that going through those rough moments is part of the lesson , of development , of enrichment			1
going through those moments , you can learn to inspire yourself			0
i inspire myself when i have to interpret a role where the character is very sad or very depressed			1
i think what i am doing to project that sound is connecting with something beyond this world			0
i just take a breath , and try to focus on one point			0
i ca n't push the sound out ; it feels more like i 'm just connecting myself with the universe			0
there are lots of times where i feel depressed or lonely or misunderstood and different			1
i do n't have a normal life with family or a partner who can help me from time to time			0
more from @entity66 : top designer @entity152 shares secret of staying in vogue the most interesting thing ( is ) that we always work with new people -- new conductors , new musicians , new partners -- on a new repertoire or a new role			1
this is the most beautiful thing that keeps me awake and makes me discover more of myself , to want more			0
you can compare being an opera singer with being an athlete : both have to practice a lot to focus on the distance			2
i also have to somehow know when i can hold myself back to maintain energy			0
some days i practice three , four , five hours , it depends			0
some days i 'm just reading , going through the score			0
we are in the most beautiful and the most known theater in the world , @entity176 in @entity177			1
great musicians , great tradition -- opera was born here			2
i 'm so happy to be here , i could cry with gratefulness and joy for the emotions i feel			2
it 's more than a dream -- it 's that the most pure desire i had in my heart that came true .			2
