@entity0 -- the five surviving @entity3 members on thursday announced their comeback performance in @entity0 next year , and fans are eagerly anticipating which vintage sketches will be dusted off for another airing			1
but their combined age of 357 years has taken its toll , and it remains to be seen how the comedians ' aging bodies stand up to the often slapstick nature of @entity3 sketches			1
one that @entity14 is unlikely to perform is the swivel - limbed " @entity18 , " due to what he says are his ailing hips and knees			1
@entity14 says the show at the @entity21 on july 1 will have some new material , but many old bits -- some featured in perhaps new ways -- that fans will expect , along with " comedy , pathos , music and a tiny bit of ancient sex			1
" " i remember going to the @entity31 and seeing @entity32 where he got booed in the second half for singing new numbers			0
people really do want to see the old hits , but we do n't want to do them exactly in a predictable way , so it 's going to be a mix - up , i think , " @entity14 adds			1
asked what he believes the modern twist will be , @entity42 replies : " the fact that we can actually still walk and stand upright			2
" while the @entity3 stars say they hope the new performance will appeal to a new generation of fans , they are brazen enough to admit that money was one of the main factors in their decision to reform for the first time since 1980			1
" i hope it makes us a lot of money			2
i hope to be able to pay off my mortgage ! " @entity60 said days before thursday 's high - octane news conference at which the five @entity62 announced they will perform at the @entity21 -- the world 's biggest - grossing concert venue			1
@entity65 adds that " money was part of it			2
" but as the five aging comedians lumber onto the stage at the @entity72 in central @entity0 , it is evident how much mutual regard they still have , despite often - fractious years working together and three decades apart			1
" we may not like each other , but we make each other laugh , " @entity14 reflects			2
the show will be the first time @entity14 , @entity60 , @entity42 , @entity65 and @entity78 have performed together since the death of @entity80 from cancer in 1989			1
his presence will be sorely missed -- by both audience and stars			0
" we 've told him he 'll be on with us , " @entity78 says , not entirely in jest , " and if there is a @entity88 , he 'll turn up			0
" there 'll be a nurse on hand just in case of emergencies , he adds quickly			0
despite the show being billed as " a final reunion " and " one down , five to go , " the comedians say a world tour may follow " depending on how long @entity78 and @entity99 live for , " @entity14 jokes			2
when the pair protest , saying they believe the deaths could occur in alphabetical order , he quips : " in your dreams @entity42			0
" the longevity of @entity3 -- and excitement the reunion has stirred up among fans appears to have taken the five @entity62 by surprise			1
" no one expected this to be more than a sunday night show at the @entity115 , " @entity78 says , referring to the first tv broadcast in 1969			0
forty - five episodes and five films later , the @entity62 are comic legends , with their legions of fans around the world able to recite every line of their scripts word - perfect			1
" i 'm just shocked and amazed " at the reaction to the reunion , he says , adding that he thought they 'd waited " until demand had died down			0
" the @entity3 shows mostly consisted of a string of barely coherent sketches , often lacking conventional punch lines and loosely tied together by @entity42 's stream of consciousness animations			2
the group dressed as old ladies , as transvestite lumberjacks , performed sketches about pompous middle - class men , used catchphrases such as " and now for something completely different , " and sang ditties such as " spam , spam , spam , spam , spam , spam , spam , spam ... " some of the material has never been performed on stage before , and the group says fans could expect the crunching frog sketch , a version of the dead parrot sketch and the @entity156			1
other material " they hope people will have forgotten , so it 'll appear new , " @entity78 adds			0
the sketches still make them laugh , despite the passing of time , @entity65 says			0
" we had a read - through of all the material , which to me was far more anxiety - inducing than the press conference			0
but it 's still funny			0
the show is going to be spectacular			0
" @entity3 has appeal around the world , he believes , because " it 's seen as physical but not topical - it does n't require knowledge of @entity174 politics or way of life			2
it 's just quite jolly ! " @entity1 's @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
