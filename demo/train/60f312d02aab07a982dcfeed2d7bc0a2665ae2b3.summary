@entity1 , @entity0 -- at @entity4 , all eyes are usually on the clothes			0
@entity7 @entity6 is one of the @entity10 world 's preeminent jewelry designers but the @entity10 and @entity12 - influenced brooches , bracelets , necklaces and rings adorning the models heading down @entity18 's catwalk are also getting attention			1
they are part of a collaboration between the fashion powerhouse and former @entity24 and @entity7 jewelry designer , @entity6			1
" i really love the craft and the skill and the romance that goes into the pieces			0
so , that teamed with my sense of high octane glamour and my @entity1 high living twist is a great mix and a contrast			0
and that 's what i like , " @entity18 enthused to @entity2			1
in return , " @entity44 " gets international exposure , to the likes of @entity42 , @entity43 and ok !			1
but do n't -- as one @entity1 paper did -- call the catwalk collection " designer bling			2
" " it 's quite a deep and nice collection -- not bling bling			2
i hate bling bling collections , " @entity51 exclaims			0
starting at $ 250 to ' the sky 's - the - limit ' , @entity51 's pioneering blends of gold , silver and precious stones , makes her one of the @entity10 world 's preeminent jewelry designers			1
the only problem is , a mere 30 percent of these ' jewels of the @entity63 ' are sold outside @entity7 -- @entity51 was missing out on the lucrative @entity65 @entity10 market			1
one of the challenges of marketing designer jewelry in the @entity68 is getting past the traditional mentality that measures an item 's worth not by exceptional finishes but by its weight in grams and karats			1
to do well in the @entity68 , @entity51 and her daughters @entity75 and @entity76 steered the family business to the @entity79			1
it started with the @entity18 collaboration , and now exclusive @entity83 stores like @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 are selling their jewelry			1
@entity10 tend to imitate @entity83 spending habits , paying big money for luxury foreign items like @entity91 or @entity92 -- but they do n't give the same attention to their own @entity10 brands			2
@entity51 believes that as her jewelry becomes popular in the @entity79 -- more @entity68 buyers will follow suit			2
the marketing strategy seems to be working			0
her team says the collections now sell in the @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
" to have a product which stands beside @entity92 , etcetera -- it 's a challenge			0
but we are sure of the ourselves because we are presenting something special , something which is different from all these brands , " @entity51 said			0
at her workshop on the outskirts of @entity116 , @entity51 's craftsmen work in the belief they 're turning precious metal into something different -- art. @entity51 's daughter , @entity123 , works for the family business as a designer and says there 's value in the design , the marketing and workmanship poured into each item			2
" at least 20 to 25 people will have touched that piece just to have one perfect piece at the end , " @entity123 explained			0
in the 60 's , @entity51 was the first woman to apprentice in @entity7 's jewelry district			1
the one - time government employee used to run a one - woman shop in her spare time			0
today , more than 180 employees drill , solder , hammer and file under her watchful eye , crafting two to three thousand pieces every year			0
the luxury goods market is a crowded one , as @entity51 well knows : " like any business , it 's not a joke , " says the designer			1
going to the @entity79 to find a better footing in the @entity68 is seriously savvy move			2
a move that could lead to future success on the catwalk -- and with more consumers worldwide .			0
