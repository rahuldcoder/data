-- @entity2 's stories of warped realities , paranoid delusions and authoritarian nightmares have made him arguably the most influential science fiction writer in @entity7 ( not that the movie industry has a monopoly on these things you understand )			2
yet the film versions of his stories -- " @entity14 , " " @entity15 , " " paycheck " -- give a highly sanitized , streamlined impression of his work			2
an inferior remake of 1990 's @entity21 movie , " @entity20 " is inspired by the short story " @entity27 , " about a clerk who dreams of going to @entity29 , but gets memory implants of the trip as the next best thing ( or does he ? )			1
the 1990 version of " @entity20 " starred @entity31			1
in the new movie , the guy , @entity32 ( @entity33 ) , commutes halfway around the world from @entity36 -- " @entity37 " -- to the only other liveable land left , the @entity39 of @entity40 , to work on an assembly line putting together robots			1
miserable about his lot in life , and plagued with a strange recurring dream , @entity32 takes a trip to @entity20 , where they promise to make his fantasies feel true			1
" you could be a spy , " they tell him			0
" work for the resistance			0
or better yet , both			0
" then , just as they inject him , the company is raided in a hail of bullets , and @entity32 is running for his life , no longer sure of who he is or what he believes			0
screenwriter @entity61 ( " @entity62 , " " @entity63 " ) has cut @entity29 out of the proceedings entirely , but he 's also eviscerated the playful , post-modern wit that spiced @entity21 's proudly gory shoot - em - up			2
the new @entity74 " can still be read both ways , as the story of a " sleeper " agent who wakes up or the story of an ordinary @entity72 's escapist fantasy			0
but either way it 's an infinitely more pedestrian entertainment , essentially a long succession of repetitive chase scenes , hollow explosions and the kind of speech balloon dialogue that reduces even good actors to robotic mode			0
why is it @entity33 always seems so much more energized in supporting roles ? none of the new film 's innovations seems to have been thought through			1
why would @entity40 be spared from a chemical apocalypse that claimed the rest of the @entity92 ? and more specifically , why would @entity93 be spared from the fallout , while @entity95 is a toxic wasteland ? why would workers in the colony commute , daily , by rocketship , to the other side of the globe to add rivets to robots ? ca n't they get robots to do that ? what are the rebels rebelling against -- long commutes ? presumably it 's intentional that @entity32 's wife , @entity111 ( @entity110 ) , could easily be the sister of resistance fighter @entity112 ( @entity113 ) -- they might share the same plastic surgeon -- but if there was a point i suspect it wound up on the cutting room floor			1
as to the look of the film , the shunting gamer action sequences will have you itching for your handset while the teeming @entity124 almost makes the much - discussed " @entity14 " sequel redundant			1
a rain - soaked , vertical metropolis fusing @entity130 and @entity131 cultures , the @entity126 replicates @entity133 's @entity132 2019 right down to the hover cars and parasols , switching @entity136 in for the @entity137			2
it has been given a digital gloss , but that might have been imported from yet another @entity2 movie , " minority report			0
" even the robots are cloned			0
in short , " @entity145 " director @entity144 has ransacked bigger , better imaginations to produce something that looks and sounds like a wholesale rip - off .			1

new film is a remake of the 1990 movie starring @entity31
this version stars @entity33 and @entity110
