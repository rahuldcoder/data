-- when players get their hands on " @entity4 " on tuesday , the gaming world will get another titillating dose of the sex and violence that has come to define the series in the eyes of millions -- many of whom have never played it			1
early reviews of the game confirm a checklist of activities from any good criminal 's daily planner : bong hits and lap dances , torture and tasers			1
they also herald the return of what the @entity26 called " the most immersive spectacle in interactive entertainment			2
" and in a world that 's learned to take " @entity33 " and @entity34 in stride , it 's a combination some predict could result in the most lucrative entertainment launch in history			2
" @entity41 is easily one of the biggest game releases of the year , " said @entity37 , editor - in - chief of games and entertainment site @entity40			1
" the previous game is still one of the biggest entertainment launches of all time , and there 's no reason to think @entity4 will be any different			1
" launched in 1997 , the " @entity41 " series is one of the most successful in video - game history , selling more than 125 million units			1
along the way , the series has transcended the gaming world to become a cultural phenomenon through its rare mix of popularity and controversy			1
@entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 are among the voice actors who have lent their talents to the series			2
flipping the script on the typical good - versus - evil story , gamers play " @entity41 " titles as criminals -- from two - bit hoodlums trying to work their way up the ranks of organized crime to seasoned , rough customers hell - bent on revenge for wrongs done to them by other crooks			1
much of the franchise 's appeal is its status as an " open world " game			1
while most video games , even those with story lines attached , keep the player busy on a predetermined course of action , open - world games allow greater freedom to explore			2
and while games with some open - world elements date back to the video arcades of the ' 80s , none had ever combined as many as the " @entity41 " series , creating an immersive experience for players of its 10 titles and numerous expansion packs			1
want to work out ? hit a night club ? get a job ? change the radio station on your car stereo ? all are possibilities			0
but there 's no denying that , for some players , the ability to do very nefarious things in that open universe has also been a draw			1
the game 's big breakout among players , as well as critics , came in 2001 with " @entity123 " perhaps the most notorious discovery in that version , set in a @entity126 - like " @entity41 , " was the player 's ability to hire a prostitute , have ( offscreen ) sex with her , kill her and then steal her money			1
the now - defunct @entity132 named " @entity123 " both " @entity133 " and " @entity134			0
" " i think this is a technically marvelous game that at the same time is absolutely reprehensible ... , " the site 's most - offensive " honor " read			1
" it 's a game that rewards you for killing innocent people by the dozen			1
in @entity123 , i can hijack a car , kill the driver , run someone down on the street , commit drive - by shootings , and score points for doing all of it			0
" in some scripted sequences , i 'm tasked to kill people at random			0
in one , the identities of the victims do n't even matter			0
the goal is merely to kill a certain amount of people within the allotted time			0
there are no significant penalties for offing bystanders			0
" the game was briefly banned in @entity160 and a modified version was later released			2
other bans , protests and even lawsuits would follow			0
but @entity40 's @entity37 says that 's not why the games have endured			1
" the more salacious content definitely gets headlines -- and undoubtedly resonates with some members of the audience -- but the real appeal of @entity41 has always been in its open - ended world , " he said			0
" here 's a game where you exist in a simulation of a real city , a sort of real - world sandbox , where you can play golf , race cars , jump out of airplanes , fly blimps and loads of other activities			1
" while those activities , by themselves , are fun , the real joy is in seeing the way the world responds to your actions and decisions			0
the combat and driving are obviously significant draws for some players , but they 're not what most set @entity41 apart			0
" controversies over violent video games feel almost as old as video games themselves , dating back to the 1980s			1
perhaps that 's why the din leading up to the release of " @entity4 " has n't been so loud			1
which is not to say controversy has gone away			0
as recently as last month , authorities in @entity208 said an 8 - year - old had been playing " @entity211 " before he shot and killed his elderly caregiver			0
( age 8 , it 's worth mentioning , is far too young to be playing the game according to its " @entity216 " rating			1
) the sheriff 's office implied the child 's activities in a violent virtual world might have led to the killing			2
but @entity222 and others see a cultural shift that 's taking the edge off of complaints			0
" i will say that the drift of modern society normalizes subjects that the previous generations would have found objectionable , " he said			0
" creators in all media intentionally shock sensibilities either to make a point or simply to get noticed			0
" games exist within a larger context , particularly with regard to violence			2
violence in games is just an expression of the presence of violence in all of our media and in society at large			2
" and for his part as an avid gamer , @entity37 welcomes anyone offended by popular titles such as " @entity41 " to speak up			0
" i do n't know that i think the protests will stop ( and ) frankly , i do n't think they should , " he said			0
" games are an increasingly important part of our culture , and we all have a responsibility to find a more appropriate , inclusive context to debate what is and is n't appropriate entertainment for certain audiences			2

" @entity4 " marks the return of one of gaming 's top titles
the series is known for expansive play *options* , *including* violence
in game , players are criminals free to act as they please
some say as our culture shifts , *reaction* to violent games is more muted
