editor 's note : @entity2 is a writer and a graduate student studying political science at @entity5			1
her writing has appeared in the @entity7 , the @entity8 , and @entity9			2
@entity2 says @entity10 represents the increasing diversity of @entity12			1
@entity13 ( @entity14 ) -- when i was a small child , even before i had the right vocabulary , i could tell that my parents were different			2
when i was with my mother , strangers would gush over me			2
when i was with my father , i felt a distance			2
for reasons deeper than i could explain , it was safer with @entity24 ; i was more special when , as far as the outside world could see , i belonged to her			2
i later learned this was because people were reacting to the fact that my mother was white and my father black			1
like a growing number of @entity12 , like our new president , i grew up straddling this country 's racial divisions			1
@entity10 , @entity12 's first black president , is also our country 's first biracial president -- no secret , but a fact that , especially in the euphoria of his inauguration , is often downplayed			1
the experience of multiracial @entity12 is as varied and complex as the races and heritages that make up our unique mixes , but when i came of age in the ' 80s and ' 90s , it was a world of stark and often strange choices			1
race was a set of mutually exclusive , ill - fitting boxes			2
we were forced to choose just one , to pick sides			2
often , the world chose for us			2
it was a question not of our culture , or how we self - identified , or even the objective makeup of our dna , but how we looked			0
@entity59 , when he rose to fame as @entity12 's first black golf star , caused an uproar after he told reporters he was " cablinasian , " a nod to his @entity70 , @entity69 , @entity67 and @entity68 ancestry			1
( he is one quarter @entity69			0
) it never occurred to @entity73 , who , after the @entity74 , made an off - color joke about @entity76 ordering fried chicken and collard greens for the next year 's @entity79 , that he might prefer @entity80			0
the story of my own family was similarly complex			0
my @entity85 mother is as white as they come			1
but my father is @entity88 , the descendant of @entity91 slaves and @entity93 plantation owners , as well as @entity94 and @entity95			0
and still , growing up , i was asked to choose between one of the two boxes available to me			0
" are you black or are you white ? " it took until 2000 before the @entity12 @entity100 allowed respondents to check off more than one racial category , a formal recognition that there are no longer two @entity105 , one black , one white , but dozens , maybe hundreds , of overlapping @entity105			1
the most recent census predictions hold that by 2042 , whites will no longer be the majority			0
@entity12 who identify as biracial or multiracial are less than 2 percent of the population , but their demographic is growing at about 3 percent each year , more than 10 times the rate of the white population			1
new immigration from @entity116 and the @entity117 is challenging old notions of what it means to be african - american			0
as the number of transracial adoptions and interracial marriages increase , the old lines , while far from vanished , are blurring			0
at the beginning of his campaign , @entity10 's exotic heritage was a liability			1
we had no idea what to do with him because we could n't place him in any of the familiar boxes			0
there were charges lobbed against him that he was , on the one hand , not black enough for black @entity12 , and , on the other , too black for the white @entity69 mainstream			1
by telling his story of being raised by white grandparents in @entity142 , their love for him and his grandmother 's utterance of racial stereotypes , and his adult quest to connect to his father 's @entity150 roots , @entity10 has changed the entire dialogue about race			1
he has managed to accomplish something truly rare : to both carry the mantle of african - americans ' struggle for justice and to transcend it			0
he is as much the fulfillment of more than 300 years of struggle as he is a symbol of the future : a president who embodies the changing landscape of our imperfect union			0
tuesday , he boldly declared it			1
in his inaugural address , @entity10 said , " ... our patchwork heritage is a strength , not a weakness			1
we are a nation of @entity173 and @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 -- and nonbelievers			0
we are shaped by every language and culture , drawn from every end of this @entity181 ; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation , and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united , we can not help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass ; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve ...			0
" when @entity10 took the stage at @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity195 , on election night , with his family , it was the first time in my 26 years of living i felt like @entity12 really belonged to people like me			1
if you were to ask me , at that moment , if i was @entity69 , even though i have blue eyes and fair skin , even though my grandparents came to this country from @entity88 , with their own language , their own concepts of race , my answer to you would be a resounding " yes ! " without the struggle of brave african - americans who came before me , my grandparents would not have had the same opportunity to pursue the @entity69 dream			0
we would not be allowed to choose freely whom we love , and i might not even exist			0
and yet if you were to ask me , in that same moment , if i were black , or biracial , or a woman of @entity88 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity217 and @entity219 descent , my answer would have been the same			2
before we become a " post-racial " @entity12 , we have to become one that is truly multiracial , comfortable with the fact that more and more @entity12 no longer wear their identities on their skins			1
that you might not be able to tell from just looking at a woman if she is @entity227 or @entity228 , or the daughter of a @entity230 and a @entity231			0
she might consider herself many things at the same time , without planting a flag or declaring an allegiance			0
@entity10 can help lead us into that new era , toward a more sophisticated conversation about culture and race			1
he should be celebrated as our first @entity91 - @entity69 president			0
he should also be allowed to be @entity150 and @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 -- all the legacies that have made him the man he is today			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : when i grew up , the choice was to identify as black or white
she says @entity12 now is more open to its multiracial population
@entity10 symbolizes the increasing diversity of the @entity12 , @entity2 says
she says he declared the change with his " patchwork heritage " remarks
