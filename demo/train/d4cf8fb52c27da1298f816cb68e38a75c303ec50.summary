is it @entity2 , @entity2 or @entity3 ? whatever you call the jihadist group known for killing dozens of people at a time , carrying out public executions , beheadings , crucifixions and other brutal acts , there is no denying they have captured the world 's attention			1
on the eve of president @entity18 's speech outlining @entity20 's strategy against the group , in which he will likely refer to it as @entity2 , we ask : what 's in a name ? it all started in 2004 when the @entity25 formed an @entity27 splinter group in @entity28			1
within two years , @entity29 's @entity27 in @entity28 was trying to fuel a sectarian war against the majority @entity32 community			0
in june 2006 , @entity29 was killed in a @entity34 strike			1
@entity35 , his successor , several months later announced the creation of the @entity3 in @entity28 ( @entity37 )			1
in april 2013 , @entity3 in @entity28 absorbed the @entity27 - backed militant group in @entity39 , @entity40 , also known as the @entity40			1
its leader @entity41 said his group will now be known as @entity2			1
since then , the @entity44 - speaking world seems to have had a hard time settling on a name for them			0
@entity2 president @entity18 , the @entity49 and some news organizations refer to the jihadist group by the acronym @entity2 , which stands for @entity2			1
@entity0 global affairs correspondent @entity53 said the @entity34 has stuck with @entity2 because the group appears to have to set it sights beyond @entity28 and @entity39			1
and also because @entity20 does n't want to recognize their plans for a caliphate			0
@entity0 national security analyst @entity59 believes @entity2 is a more accurate translation of the group 's name			1
the ' l ' stands for @entity63 which is a translation of " @entity65 " -- the word the group uses to refer to itself , @entity59 said			2
" but the @entity63 is a relatively obscure word in @entity44 -- in @entity44 , we refer to @entity39			0
of course , the @entity63 is larger than @entity39 , " @entity59 said			0
" we believe this is the most accurate translation of the group 's name and reflects its aspirations to rule over a broad swath of the @entity79 , " said @entity70 , vice president and senior managing editor for international news for @entity73 , according to an @entity73 blog post			2
@entity65 is a reference to a region that stretches from @entity82 through @entity39 to @entity83 and includes the @entity85 territories , @entity86 and @entity87 , according to @entity88 , a @entity89 professor and expert on @entity39 history			0
part of the confusion stems from the fact that @entity65 has many meanings in @entity96			2
@entity88 said : " how you translate ' @entity65 ' determines whether you have an @entity98 or an 's ' in @entity44			0
it 's the same word in @entity96			2
how you translate the term into @entity44 determines if you 're of the ' @entity2 ' camp or the ' @entity2 ' camp			2
the @entity63 , which can extend from northern @entity83 to @entity103 , is not as precise			0
" on the @entity34 government 's use of @entity2 , @entity88 surmised : " maybe because you do n't want to give the dignity of the name that they give themselves			1
" @entity110 , a visiting fellow at the @entity111 at @entity112 , said via email that @entity2 is preferable in @entity44 " to make it clear to a @entity116 audience			2
" @entity63 denotes @entity39 and @entity87 in @entity96 , " so better to stick to @entity2 and clarify that it 's the same as @entity2 , but a more accurate translation from the @entity96 , " he said			1
@entity2 @entity2 is an @entity44 translation of the acronym in @entity96 for @entity122 @entity121 , or the @entity3 in @entity28 and @entity65			1
the organization has said its goal is to form an @entity2 state , or caliphate , over the entire region , stretching from @entity82 through @entity39 to @entity83 and including the @entity85 territories , @entity86 and @entity87			2
some think @entity2 flows better as a word in @entity44			0
it also happens to be the name of one of a goddess of ancient @entity83			0
@entity0 has been referring to the organization as @entity2 , shorthand for the @entity3 in @entity28 and @entity39			1
arabic speakers say @entity65 can be translated to mean the @entity63 , @entity39 , greater @entity39 , and even @entity137			0
@entity3 the jihadists like to refer to themselves simply as the @entity3 , a term more accurately reflecting the organization 's aspirations of creating a caliphate across national borders			0
they prefer to be known either as the @entity3 -- @entity143 in @entity96 -- or just the @entity2 , @entity144			1
that is what they call themselves in online videos			0
@entity149 finally , a lesser - known acronym to @entity116 readers : @entity149			0
it is the straight @entity96 shorthand for the group known as : al - dawla al - islamiya fi @entity121 , commonly used in the @entity156 world and among many @entity156 media outlets and politicians			1
when people in the @entity156 world , use the term @entity149 , it 's derogatory , according to @entity89 's @entity88			0
" those who disagree with them , call them daiish , " @entity88 said , adding that the jihadists have objected to the name .			0

@entity2 is translation of the acronym in @entity96 for the @entity2
@entity34 *officials* , the @entity49 , some media use @entity2 : @entity2
@entity174 group prefers " the @entity3 " or just " the @entity2 "
