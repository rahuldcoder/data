@entity0 , @entity1 -- for a man who used to hang a framed picture of @entity6 in his @entity8 office , president @entity3 declared that checking out a museum honoring the @entity1 independence hero 's legacy was " pretty cool " saturday			1
shortly after landing here for his first stop on a 10 - day tour of @entity15 , the president and first lady @entity17 quickly headed over to this city 's @entity18 , a three - story home where @entity6 stayed when he was in @entity0			1
it 's now full of historic photos and posters as well as a library with about 50,000 @entity6 - related works			1
this was like manna from heaven for the president , who once declared that the one person living or dead that he 'd love to have dinner with would be @entity6			2
" now it would probably be a really small meal , because he did n't eat a lot , " @entity3 joked then about @entity6 's fasting			2
on saturday , @entity3 was particularly tickled about getting to sign a guest book at the museum and taking a peek at an older guest book that was signed by the rev. @entity41 , who also saw @entity6 as an inspiration for the civil rights movement in @entity44			1
" pretty cool -- 1959 , " the president said after seeing @entity41 's signature			2
the president spent several minutes in the library , which has @entity6 quotations on the walls , such as , " freedom is like a birth			2
" @entity3 seemed particularly moved by another quotation : " to call women the weaker sex is a libel			0
it is man 's injustice to women			0
... if nonviolence is the law of our being , the future is with women			0
" " look at that , " the president said			0
" it 's my favorite , " responded his guide , @entity70 , a trustee of the museum			0
when he signed the guest book , @entity3 left this inscription : " i am filled with hope and inspiration as i have the privilege to visit this testament to @entity6			1
he is a hero not just to @entity1 , but to the world			0
" mrs. @entity17 wrote simply , " this visit will be one that i will always remember ... " the @entity3 tribute to @entity6 will continue sunday , when the first couple lay a wreath at his grave site			1
and on their way out of the museum , the president said the couple would definitely be back someday , next time with their daughters .			0
