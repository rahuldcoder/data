-- breaking nose news ! @entity4 can wear a nasal strip on june 7 in the @entity6 , the third leg of horse racing 's " @entity8 , " track officials confirmed on monday , so we can all breathe a little easier about him now			1
i keep hearing why @entity4 ca n't become our next @entity13 , with a capital s : @entity15 ca n't win the @entity16 because : 1 ) he is the odds - on favorite to win , and the derby 's favorite " never " wins , and 2 ) he is a @entity22 - bred , and a @entity22 horse " never " wins the derby			1
then he did win the @entity16			0
@entity15 ca n't win the @entity25 because : 1 ) he developed a cough before the race , so he 's obviously too " hoarse " to win ( hahaha ) , and 2 ) the horse ate like a pig for two solid weeks following the @entity16 , putting on so much weight that there 's no way he will win the @entity25			1
then he did win the @entity25			2
i suppose it should n't have been a shock that i began hearing why @entity4 would n't win the @entity6 on june 7 , and with it the " @entity8 " of horse racing , becoming the first horse to earn this coveted crown since @entity38 in 1978			1
he was going to lose it by a nose			0
@entity4 wears a nasal strip , not unlike human beings who want to keep dust and dirt and true grit and other stuff that 's hazardous to your health out of their sinus passages			1
he has won six races in a row with a nasal strip across his handsome proboscis			2
it obviously gave this @entity22 smog - breather a little breathing room			0
but whoa ... a possibility suddenly existed that @entity15 would n't be permitted to wear a nasal strip for the @entity6 race , which at a mile and a half is the longest of the @entity8 events and which is run on @entity65 in @entity66 , which has been known to have a speck of dust or two			1
( hey , it 's an " island			0
" ) the last time this nasal - strip business came up , a horse named i 'll have another had just won the @entity16 and @entity25 to become the four - legged darling of 2012			1
if it could win the @entity6 next , it could become the 12th horse in the history of thoroughbred hoofbeats to win that @entity8			2
not to mention the prize money and the millions of dollars in stud fees that went along with it			0
back in 2012 , @entity6 's racing officials had notified i 'll have another 's handlers that a nasal strip would be prohibited			1
it is up to each organization 's discretion whether to permit such a thing , so @entity6 's decision makers , along with those from the @entity91 , had the final say			0
it became moot when i 'll have another was withdrawn on the eve of the @entity6 , unable to go for " another " due to a sore tendon			0
this weekend , the nose thing reared its ugly head again			0
@entity15 's trainer , 77 - year - old @entity100 , pointed out sunday that there was a distinct possibility the horse 's owners might yank their fast horse right out of the race			1
he said a nasal strip had been the idea of @entity109 , the horse 's co-owner , who has been thoroughly pleased with the thoroughbred 's success since strapping it onto his schnoz			1
" he might not run if they say you ca n't run with a nasal strip , " @entity100 suggested			2
@entity109 is an unpredictable guy			0
he did n't even attend saturday 's running of the @entity25			1
the horse 's other owner , @entity120 , a walrus - mustached @entity122 lookalike in a cowboy hat , indicated his partner @entity109 was still doing a burn over what he deemed to be inhospitable treatment at @entity128 during the @entity16			1
it was n't long after @entity4 's impressive victory ( by a length and a half ) in @entity133 that the downside of the @entity136 experience , two weeks before , reared its ugly head			1
" even though we won ( the @entity16 ) , it was a bad day for my partner and his family , " @entity120 blurted out on @entity109 's behalf			2
one complaint reportedly was the way the needs of @entity109 's mother , an elderly woman in a wheelchair , were not met after @entity109 went to great effort to bring her to @entity128 for the race			2
by coincidence , @entity150 , the jockey of the great secretariat during the 1970s , also is in a wheelchair and complained about @entity128 ' indifference to his situation			0
@entity150 implied that he would never go to a @entity16 again			0
" handicap " is strictly a horse - race term in this generation , no longer a permissible word in regard to human physicality			2
oh , though , it sure is becoming a topical double - entendre these days at @entity128			0
as for a certain living creature 's breathing needs ? @entity100 said of nasal strips , " a lot of horses all over @entity22 wear them all the time ... @entity133 lets you use them			1
" furthermore , harness - race horses -- trotters and pacers pulling sulkies -- apparently do have permission in @entity66 to wear nasal strips as well			1
but would @entity6 say nay to @entity15 's wearing one ? nope , they say ok			0
@entity4 , the coast is clear			0
and so is your nasal cavity , so on you go to the third and last run for everlasting glory			0
@entity8 winners thus far : sir @entity185 ( 1919 ) , @entity186 ( 1930 ) , @entity187 ( 1935 ) , @entity188 ( 1937 ) , @entity189 ( 1941 ) , @entity190 ( 1943 ) , assault ( 1946 ) , @entity192 ( 1948 ) , @entity193 ( 1973 ) , @entity194 ( 1977 ) and @entity38 ( 1978 )			2
i was n't among the 123,469 spectators at @entity199 who saw saturday 's running of the @entity25			1
i did , 3,000 miles away , go to @entity203 , basically the " home track " of @entity4 , to watch the race alongside thousands of his fans , many of whom wore a free purple or green @entity4 cap they were given as they entered the track			1
it was a sunny , smog - free day under a beautiful blue sky , so i saw no human in a face mask			0
if the @entity218 's favorite horse did n't get to run in @entity66 because of what he did n't get to wear , a lot of these people would have had a new reason to hold their noses			2
they 'd have all been saying , " this stinks			0
" luckily , no hanky - panky is happening and @entity15 is good to go			0
the nose mess has been cleared up			0
( note : this article was updated with news of the decision by @entity66 officials monday to allow the nasal strips			1

@entity4 wins the @entity25 and could *contend* for the @entity8
@entity234 says nasal strips could get in the way , if racing officials *object* to them
he says the horse 's fans wo n't be happy if it 's not allowed to race with nasal strips
no horse has won the @entity8 since 1978
