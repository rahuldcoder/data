we journeyed down @entity2 's @entity1 when a story appeared before us like a supernatural vision			1
a wave , a long wave , stretched shore to shore , beneath a panorama of snow and icy - gray november splendor in @entity2 's @entity12			1
and there it was , in the distance			0
" they 're surfing ! surfing in @entity2 ! " i exclaimed in immature glee to @entity20 photographer @entity19 , who was driving			2
he and i are a journalistic light infantry : we get our assignments , grab a @entity24 ( a video phone that replaces a satellite truck ) and off we go to far - flung destinations to report on politics			0
now we entered hyper - drive to document a traveler 's surprise : we wanted to catch a wave and a surfer on camera			0
and @entity19 began filming out of the window of the @entity39 rental			0
just who was this mystery surfer ? would they be a good interview ? we arrived on the shore to meet the arctic surfer			0
the trim athlete in the black wetsuit , hood and gloves was a 22 - year - old woman			0
@entity51 , as it turns out , is an @entity2 adventurer who seems as if she 's jacked up on adrenalin , @entity53 and caramel corn			1
could we film her ? why yes , she said			0
by the way , she added , do you want some video she made of herself using a @entity59 camera ? and with a drone flying overhead ? some stories come gift - wrapped			1
@entity62 told us about the thrill of the @entity2 surf and about the constant strain on the thighs during 15 - minute rides on the tidal bore			1
" you just wait for the bore tide to take you away , " she said			2
" you ride it for as long as you can go , which can be miles			2
" what in the name of the @entity78 is a tidal bore ? this rarity from @entity81 occurs when the edge of the incoming tide gets pushed up by the outgoing flow of a river or narrow inlet 's current , forming a wave			1
there are a few dozen tidal bores shredding the globe , in all climates and perhaps most dramatically in @entity94 's @entity93			1
@entity2 gave @entity19 and me our first glimpse of a tidal bore			1
during a prior trip , we played a hunch and found @entity102 voting in a hockey rink on @entity104 and had a nice live chat in 2012			0
now we found @entity51 surfing in 40 - degree water between so much amazing scenery			2
even she says it 's hard to stay focused and not fall off the board .			0

@entity2 's @entity12 is home to 15 - minute long tidal bores
a tidal bore is a natural wonder when an incoming tide is pushed up by current
@entity51 , 22 , rides the bore tide using a @entity59 and a drone
one surf ride can last miles , she says
