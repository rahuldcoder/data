@entity0 , @entity1 -- the new commander of @entity5 forces in @entity1 stood just feet away from @entity7 soldiers on friday			1
just one day after gen. @entity8 was installed as the head of the @entity12 @entity11 / @entity10 , he visited the border between @entity14			1
that area , better known as the @entity16 , or @entity17 , is somewhat ironically named , considering it may be one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world			0
as @entity8 arrived at the truce village of @entity22 and entered the building where the armistice that ended the @entity25 was signed in 1953 , @entity7 soldiers , some with binoculars , watched through the windows from their side of the border , behind a simple concrete threshold			1
they also took photographs -- the usual @entity7 response to @entity35 visiting the area			0
standing at an observation post overlooking @entity7 , the general said , " i thought it very important that i come to the @entity16 to observe first - hand the readiness levels and the training and the leadership of the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) military and @entity5 participation so i have a better understanding of the mission			1
" @entity5 and @entity1 soldiers briefed @entity8 on the security situation there			2
when asked to characterize the current @entity7 threat , @entity8 said it was important " to maintain the deterrence " but also expressed hope the threat would diminish some day			0
despite the armistice signing , @entity7 and @entity1 have been technically at war since 1950 , and recent attempts at peace talks have repeatedly failed			2
tensions have remained high on the peninsula since @entity7 carried out two attacks on the @entity1 last year , killing 50 @entity1 .			0
