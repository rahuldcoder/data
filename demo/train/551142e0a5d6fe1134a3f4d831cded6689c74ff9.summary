-- buggy websites , long hold times and other glitches have marred the first two days of the long - awaited rollout of open enrollment for @entity7 health - care coverage			1
blame the gawkers , at least in part , health - care experts said wednesday			1
" i think a lot of people trying to get on were just curious , like me , " said @entity13 health policy expert @entity11			2
" once that initial curiosity dies down and it 's just people who need policies , you 'll see much less traffic			2
" in the 24 hours after its launch , more than 4.7 million people have visited the federal website providing signups in 34 states , @entity28 spokeswoman @entity27 said tuesday			0
government officials have n't said how many have actually signed up			2
" we expect to see similar volume as yesterday , and while this overwhelming interest is continuing to cause wait times , there will be continuing improvements in the coming hours and days , " @entity27 said			0
states running their own exchanges reported high traffic volumes as well , suggesting that the problems were related to the intense traffic : too many people had bellied up to the virtual service counter , and the hardware dedicated to sending webpages to users ' computers could n't make out the questions for all the shouting			1
the effect is similar to , if less nefarious than , a common attack used by hackers to bring down websites : sending so much traffic its way that servers slow or even shut down			0
' too many people ' such problems do not mean , as some @entity58 critics of the health plan have said , that @entity7 is already a failure , said @entity60 , an assistant professor at @entity61 and a former program specialist with the @entity63 who also served on president @entity66 's health - care task force			1
" it 's a technical problem , too many people coming in , " he said			2
the exchanges are complex technological systems that require a lot of interplay between agencies , and there 's only so much engineers can do to test a system before opening it to the public , he said			2
" you really need to test them in real time and then backfill with some of the things you really need to get them to work , " @entity60 said			0
@entity27 said the department is " working to speed up the process " and expects enrollment times to drop " in the coming hours			0
" obstructionism ? there 's no evidence , @entity11 said , that political opposition to the plan has had any negative effect on enrollment			1
the federal government is operating the exchange in 34 states , many of which refused to participate because of political opposition to the plan			1
in @entity102 , for instance , the @entity100 quoted insurance commissioner @entity103 as saying at a private political gathering in july that state leaders were doing " everything in our power to be an obstructionist			1
" according to @entity110 , the state is one of 15 that passed laws to regulating the work of patient advisers , or navigators , called for in the health - care law			2
but @entity11 said such efforts , which could hinder efforts to reach people who may not be aware of the program or do n't have access to a computer , would n't have played any role in the glitches seen by enrollment websites the past two days			1
and @entity126 , who just passed the test to become a navigator in @entity102 on wednesday , said such efforts are n't having any effect on getting word out about the program			0
he predicted no problems signing up for anyone who wants coverage before the december 15 deadline to get coverage on january 1			0
consumers have until march 15 to sign up for coverage beginning in april			0
just wait @entity139 and many state officials in charge of the plans have suggested that consumers wait until the initial rush dies down before trying to shop for coverage			0
meanwhile , @entity58 -- locked with congressional @entity146 and the president over efforts to eliminate the health reform program -- seized on the glitches as evidence that it has already failed			1
" we have been warned time and time again that @entity7 is not ready for prime time			1
well , it turns out that is right , " rep. @entity154 , @entity155 , said tuesday			0
but sen. @entity157 , @entity158 , said wednesday that it 's only natural to expect " some bumps in the road , glitches maybe , some problems with the website			1
" president @entity164 said as much tuesday , noting that technology giant @entity165 had suffered glitches with its new smartphone operating system			0
" i do n't remember anybody suggesting @entity165 should stop selling iphones or @entity169 , " he said .			0

problems accessing @entity7 insurance exchange sites stem from *big* demand , experts say
there 's no evidence political opposition to the plan has played any role , they say
*advocates* suggest waiting to apply for insurance
@entity58 say glitches prove health reform is n't ready
