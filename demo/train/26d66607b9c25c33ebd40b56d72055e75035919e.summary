-- despite defense criticisms of what it called a " shameful " leading question about whether @entity6 tried to intimidate a neighbor , a judge ruled thursday that the former @entity10 - area police officer 's murder trial can proceed			1
five witnesses took the stand in @entity13 on thursday , but not before lawyers from both sides argued about whether a mistrial should be ordered , thus bringing the entire case back to square one			0
this debate followed testimony wednesday by @entity21 , a @entity22 , @entity23 , neighbor of @entity6 's ex-wife @entity24 and one of those who found her dead in a dry , clean bathtub on march 1 , 2004			1
@entity21 testified @entity28 had asked him to put a lock on her bedroom door and also that @entity6 had once challenged him about the front door locks at @entity28 's house being changed , which @entity21 insisted he did n't do			1
the night of march 1 , he said @entity6 -- a police officer in @entity22 who was barred from seeing @entity28 by a protective order -- called the @entity35 house to say a locksmith was coming to get in his ex-wife 's house			1
after the door was unlocked , @entity21 , some of his family members and @entity6 came across @entity28 's body , with no rug or towel nearby , in an upstairs bathroom			1
later , prosecutor @entity46 brought up the time @entity6 questioned @entity21 about whether he 'd changed the locks of @entity28 's front door , asking him , " did there come a time when you felt intimidated by him ? " " yes , " @entity21 responded			1
" we had a conversation			0
he accused me of changing the locks on the front door			0
i ( said ) i did n't , but i got his message ... i found a .38 bullet out on the driveway			0
" catch up on the @entity6 case in 3 minutes after this statement , defense lawyer @entity62 objected and subsequently judge @entity64 asked the jurors and the witness to leave the courtroom			1
on thursday , @entity62 argued for a mistrial , saying , " ( prosecutors ) are going to try and continue ... to put in evidence that people were fearful of mr. @entity6 ... so far , we have a jury that thinks everybody 's afraid of mr. @entity6			1
how is that fair to mr. @entity6 ? " calling the state 's question leading and unfair , the defense lawyer added that prosecutors were acting as if " the rules of evidence do n't apply to them , " which he called " shameful			1
" prosecutor @entity85 , in response , said it was " absurd " to suggest the state was " trying to mislead this jury			0
" the judge ruled the question and response was inadmissible , later instructing jurors to ignore it and any reference to a bullet			0
but he also said the trial should continue and that the jury could consider the rest of @entity21 's testimony			2
with this issue settled , the trial resumed with the testimony of @entity102 , the paramedic who saw @entity103 " down in the bathtub " with no pulse			0
he spoke about her hair being matted down and skin feeling cold and " waxy			0
" @entity102 said he did n't see any towels to suggest @entity28 might have been taking a bath , questioning whether a blue towel shown in a picture from the scene was actually there that night			0
a locksmith , @entity115 , took the stand next to discuss being called -- with a call straight to his cell phone , even though he was not on call for his shop that night -- and unlocking the front door of @entity28 's house , with @entity6 standing next to him flashlight in hand			1
three @entity22 firefighters later testified about their experience at the @entity28 house that night , noting the presence of several people , including @entity6			2
two of them said @entity6 , who was in uniform , asked them to be respectful of the scene because it was his ex-wife			2
testimony will resume friday and , after a three - day weekend , pick up on tuesday			0
the entire trial is expected to last about four weeks			0
@entity6 's letter to the media @entity6 , now 58 , was married to @entity28 in 2001 when he had an affair with then - 17 - year - old @entity141 , who later became @entity6 's fourth wife			1
he has been called a suspect in her 2007 disappearance , though he 's never been charged and she has never been found			2
@entity28 and @entity6 filed for divorce that october , and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years			2
@entity22 police records indicate officers were called to @entity28 's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004			1
@entity6 had @entity28 arrested twice for domestic violence , though she was found not guilty in both cases			2
a judge in march 2002 granted @entity28 a protection order from her ex-husband , prohibiting him from being near her , entering her home or taking out their children except for two brief weekly visits			0
@entity28 had claimed that months after that order was issued , @entity6 held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her inside her home			2
on february 27 , 2004 , @entity6 picked up his two sons from @entity28 's home , spending the next two days with them			1
prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on february 29 and killed @entity28			0
at the time of her death , which authorities initially treated as an accident , a court was mulling how the couple 's marital assets would be divided , and @entity28 was set to receive part of @entity6 's pension and other support			1
during opening statements tuesday , one of @entity6 's lawyers argued that their client spent his career protecting the public and that murder accusations are groundless			1
" @entity46 slipped , fell , hit her head in a household accident , and drowned			0
case closed , " said attorney @entity190			0
@entity193 's @entity192 in @entity13 contributed to this report .			0

@entity6 's lawyer calls prosecutors " shameful " and demands a mistrial
the judge *refuses* , though he strikes a part of the testimony of one witness
