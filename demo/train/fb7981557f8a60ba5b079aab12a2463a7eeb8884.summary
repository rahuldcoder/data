-- @entity2 's decision this week to shun federal funding for high - speed rail has set off an auction house - like frenzy among some states hoping to get a bigger piece of the pie			1
@entity11 @entity2 gov. @entity10 said he rejected the rail funds because the risks outweighed the benefits , citing the projected costs to state taxpayers and " overly optimistic " ridership and revenue projections			1
the plan " would likely result in ongoing subsidies that state taxpayers would have to incur , " he said in a statement wednesday			0
" i was elected to get @entity23 back to work and to change the way government does business in our state , " @entity10 said			1
with his rejection of the highly touted federal money , @entity10 joined two other @entity11 governors elected in november -- @entity34 's @entity33 and @entity36 's @entity35 -- in turning down funds from the @entity39 initiative for national high - speed rail			1
@entity2 was offered $ 2.4 billion to link @entity41 and @entity42 by rail			1
@entity2 officials had hoped the tracks would be the first of a three - part system that would connect the tourist destinations of @entity42 , @entity41 and @entity49			1
the rail funds are part of the @entity53 administration 's @entity55 project , which the @entity39 hopes will make high - speed rail accessible to 80 % of @entity57 by 2035			0
the administration recently proposed $ 53 billion in additional spending on the national high - speed rail project			0
the plan represents a significant expansion of the $ 10.5 billion already allocated for high speed rail , including $ 8 billion in the 2009 economic stimulus package			0
@entity11 have targeted billions of dollars in cuts from the current year 's budget , with high - speed rail one of the targets			0
given the momentum the @entity39 hoped to gain from the states ' cooperation , transportation secretary @entity68 said he was " extremely disappointed " in @entity10 's refusal to take the funds			1
immediately after @entity10 's decision , state jockeying to take @entity2 's share of rail funding began in full force -- including immediate overtures from @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
@entity57 sen. @entity83 , @entity80 , wrote @entity68 acknowledging the more than $ 1.4 billion sent to @entity53 's home state			1
" but more can be done , " @entity83 said			0
" @entity80 is ready and willing to put rail dollars to work if other states are not			2
in fact , the funding dedicated to @entity2 can accelerate completing other segments of the @entity92 high - speed network , " @entity83 said			0
@entity94 @entity82 sen. @entity93 also wrote to @entity68 , imploring him to redirect the funds to @entity82			0
" these investments will create jobs , spur economic development and continue to build on the growth of ridership we 've seen in recent years , " she said			0
" you are keenly aware of the benefits that high - speed rail development would bring @entity82 and the @entity57 , which is why i respectfully request that these dismissed funds be re-appropriated to @entity82 and the @entity107			2
" the stakes are high : in december , @entity68 announced that 14 states would divvy up the $ 1.4 billion that @entity34 and @entity36 spurned , with @entity81 getting the lion 's share			2
then - gov. @entity111 , a @entity11 , wrote to the @entity53 administration at the time : " you are more than welcome to redirect that money to @entity81			1
" this week , a @entity81 lawmaker acknowledged another potential windfall to the state			2
" it 's a cloudy day in the @entity2 , " @entity94 rep. @entity118 of @entity119 said wednesday			2
" but @entity2 's deep loss is likely to be @entity81 's tremendous gain			1
we 're prepared to show the rest of the country what a modern transportation network looks like and will gladly invest every penny the federal government is willing to provide , " he said			0
on friday , @entity131 threw its hat in the ring			1
" @entity131 and the @entity136 ( @entity107 ) would benefit greatly from receipt of the federal high - speed rail funds recently rejected by the governor of @entity2 , " @entity94 @entity131 gov. @entity134 said in a statement addressed to @entity68			1
in @entity2 , criticism of the governor 's move came from both sides of the political aisle			2
some @entity11 lawmakers wondered if the governor 's actions could be sidestepped			0
" i do n't know constitutionally speaking whether or not this can be rejected by the governor without the consent of the @entity153 , " @entity11 state sen. @entity148 told the @entity149			0
also , @entity2 @entity11 @entity57 rep. @entity11 , chairman of the @entity155 , and @entity57 sen. @entity156 , a @entity2 @entity157 , said they would try to bypass the governor 's decision			1
@entity94 rep. @entity161 said @entity23 could have used the appropriation to create jobs			0
the funds were originally sought by then - gov. @entity165 , a @entity11 turned independent			0
" gov. @entity10 's decision demonstrates a devastating lack of vision for @entity2 and a lack of understanding of our economic situation , " @entity161 said			1
" the governor put his own rigid ideology ahead of the best interests of @entity2 's businesses , workers and families			2
high - speed rail is projected to create thousands and thousands of jobs in our state			0
" the @entity53 administration has given @entity2 until february 25 to accept the transit funds , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity187 in @entity42			1
@entity156 said state officials were researching a plan to have a private metropolitan organization take oversight of the rail project without the governor			2
" looks like we are going to have to find another entity that would be something other than the state in order to channel the funds through , along with participation of the private companies that are bidding to build and to operate the high - speed rail , " @entity156 said on his @entity195 channel			0
" we have the lawyers in the @entity206 that are now doing the research			0

immediately after @entity2 gov. @entity10 's decision , state jockeying for rail money began
on friday , @entity131 threw its hat in the ring , following @entity81 , @entity80 and @entity82
@entity2 officials hope a *bipartisan* *coalition* can save @entity2 rail . *deadline* is february 25
