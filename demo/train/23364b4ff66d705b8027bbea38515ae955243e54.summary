@entity0 -- the @entity2 became a sea of red , white and blue sunday , as tens of thousands celebrated the diamond jubilee of @entity6 -- so perhaps it was only fitting that alongside all the flags , another great @entity9 tradition was very much in evidence : @entity13 skies and rain			1
some 20,000 people took to the water aboard 1,000 vessels for a river pageant featuring dragon boats , a floating belfry and the royal barge			1
the event -- inspired by regal riverside celebrations of the past -- was the largest such celebration on the @entity2 for hundreds of years			1
around a million people were expected to line the route to cheer on the queen , at the head of a seven - mile long flotilla			1
but bad weather meant a planned fly - past was canceled			0
follow @entity1 's live blog @entity34 and her family staked out their claim to a spot near @entity38 -- where the festivities reached a climax on sunday evening			1
" it 's cold , but i do n't mind , " the 10 year old , wearing a cardboard duchess of @entity45 mask that was rapidly dissolving in the drizzle , told @entity1			1
" it was raining for the queen 's coronation too			1
i 'm just really excited , i ca n't wait			0
" " it 's only the second time someone has reigned for 60 years , " her aunt @entity50 added			2
" it 's a big accomplishment , and we wanted to celebrate that			1
" there are about 20 of us -- we 've come well prepared , " she said , pointing out picnic supplies , party masks of the royal family -- including a corgi -- and pink champagne , " and we do n't care what the weatherman says			1
" here 's to @entity65 ! " she toasted , raising her glass			2
@entity67 celebrate @entity6 @entity68 , from @entity69 , was the first to arrive at @entity38 on saturday			1
she had planned to camp out , but when it began raining , stewards persuaded her to spend the night in a tent nearby			0
@entity68 told @entity1 it was " well worth it -- i 'm in the perfect position , " and said such events made her very proud to be @entity9			1
" in 1935 , when i was 10 , my father took the family to @entity80 to watch the silver jubilee celebrations for @entity82 and @entity83 , and i 've been privileged to be present at all of the major royal events since then			1
" after gathering upriver in west @entity0 , the flotilla made its way from @entity87 to @entity38 , passing through the heart of @entity9 's capital city over the course of several hours			1
at the front were 300 man - powered boats , with thousands of volunteers propelling them down river , flags and streamers fluttering around them			1
a barge carrying the eight @entity99 -- the largest of which , at nearly half a ton , is named for the monarch -- led the way , with peals of bells ringing out from church towers along the river			1
bumming a smoke from the queen : when the security bubble bursts @entity109 came passenger boats , pleasure boats , historic wooden vessels -- the oldest built in 1740 -- and boats carrying members of the armed forces , police and fire services			2
one of the boats taking part , the @entity118 , also took part in the 1897 @entity123 celebrations for @entity124 , @entity9 's longest - serving monarch and the only other to reach the landmark 60 years on the throne			1
the biggest cheers were reserved for the present queen , who was carried aboard a specially - converted royal barge , opulently draped in red and gold			2
sailing boats that were too tall to pass under the 14 bridges along the river pageant route lined the river from @entity136 to @entity137 , in the east , creating an avenue of sails set against the @entity141 and the city 's financial center			1
the queen disembarked at @entity38 and looked on as the remainder of the river pageant passed by in a riot of color and noise			1
excitement grew as a gun salute rang out from the @entity141			0
nearby , those not lucky enough to get a riverside spot before the area was locked down , watched the pageant on a big screen			2
cheers , whistles and the odd chorus of " @entity159 " rang out , and the crowd stayed jolly despite the rain			0
@entity162 , from @entity163 , said she bought her family along to enjoy a once - in - a - lifetime spectacle			2
" we 're never going to see this sort of thing again			0
i 've got a little boy and i thought it was important for him to see it			0
i still remember the @entity173 in 1977			0
it 's a great atmosphere here , everyone is so friendly			2
" to @entity178 , from @entity0 , events on the river were just a forerunner of the main attraction of the day - the after party he was planning at home			2
@entity178 , decked out from head to toe in @entity186 flags , and sporting red , white and blue contact lenses , said simply : " i love the queen			0
" not everyone was of the same opinion			0
in a street behind the @entity195 building , scores of pro-republican campaigners had gathered , waving placards reading : " make monarchy history " and " do n't jubilee - ve it " and chanting " monarchy out , republic in			2
" today though , they seemed resigned to the fact that they were well and truly in the minority			0
as the queen 's barge approached and @entity38 lifted in salute , red white and blue streamers were tossed from the crowd			1
and then , as if on cue , the heavens opened , rain lashing those gathered on the riverbanks below			0
hoods and umbrellas went up , coats and ponchos went on , quickly followed by shouts of " brolleys down " from those behind			0
some of those who had gathered fled to shelter , but others remained determined to see out the whole seven - mile flotilla , even in torrential rain			2
@entity226 had been waiting for the flotilla since 11 a.m. on sunday			2
it was well worth the wait , he said			0
" i 've had my son @entity230 , who 's 8 , on my shoulders so we saw the whole thing , and we 'll be staying a little longer			0
" @entity0 's @entity235 said as many as 6,000 extra officers were on patrol during jubilee events			0
the huge security operation comes as @entity0 prepares to host the @entity240 , which open in late july			0
outside the capital , @entity9 gathered for thousands of jubilee - themed street parties and barbecues sunday			1
stores have been filled for weeks with an array of patriotic paraphernalia , from flag - adorned teapots to aprons to picnic sets , to help hosts set the scene for what is billed as a national celebration			0
the celebrations continue on monday and tuesday , which have been declared public holidays to mark the diamond jubilee			0
an afternoon garden party at @entity260 will be followed monday evening by a televised pop concert outside the palace grounds			0
at the end of the concert , the queen will take to the stage to light the " @entity267 , " which will be on the @entity80			0
she will use a diamond made from crystal glass , which has been on display at the @entity141 from the beginning of may , to light the flame			0
more than 4,000 beacons will then be lit in communities throughout the @entity9 , along with the @entity275 and @entity9 @entity276			1
tuesday will be a day of pomp and ceremony , as the queen attends a service of thanksgiving at @entity281 , followed after lunch in @entity283 by a carriage procession back to @entity260 , where she will appear on the balcony , flanked by members of the royal family .			1
