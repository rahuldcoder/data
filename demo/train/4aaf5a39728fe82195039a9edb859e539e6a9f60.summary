-- this month , just outside of @entity2 , a man police say had a history of abusing and threatening women got his hands on a gun and executed six members of his ex-wife 's family -- including four children			1
on that day , local law enforcement officials believe he was on his way to hunt down other family members when , thankfully , they ended his rampage			0
in our country , it 's a sadly common story : an abuser or stalker gains access to guns and destroys the lives of women and families in our communities			1
that 's why it is time for @entity29 to address this lethal mix of domestic violence and guns			1
our leaders must pass laws that prevent stalkers and abusers from accessing guns to intimidate , hurt or kill women			1
domestic violence : the next front in gun control fight the numbers should shock you : women in @entity44 are 11 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than women in other democratic countries with developed economies			1
in domestic abuse situations , if the abuser has access to a gun , it increases the chance that a woman will die by 500 %			1
most of the time , women are murdered with guns by someone they know , either by a family member or an intimate partner , such as a former or current husband or boyfriend			1
between 2001 and 2012 , more women were shot to death by an intimate partner in our country than the total number of @entity44 troops killed in the @entity72 and @entity73 wars combined			2
that is a national shame			0
fortunately , the momentum is on our side			0
on wednesday , the @entity78 will hold its first - ever hearing on domestic violence homicides and the use of gun violence against @entity44 's women			1
many of our elected leaders are calling for new protections for those who are subject to abuse			2
states are already taking bipartisan action			0
and @entity44 support these laws by staggering margins			0
keeping weapons from mentally ill proves elusive currently , federal law prevents people who are under domestic violence protection orders or have misdemeanor domestic violence convictions from accessing guns			1
but even though increasing numbers of couples are choosing to marry later in life , the law has n't been extended to address dating partner abuse			1
and convicted stalkers can still get guns			2
common sense says that these dangerous loopholes should be closed now			0
@entity29 has the power to do it			2
those who argue that stalkers do n't necessarily exhibit violent or threatening behavior have n't been on the other side of a conversation with a woman who fears for her life because her former boyfriend or acquaintance is promising to find her and kill her			0
the reality is three out of four women killed by their intimate partner were stalked before their death			2
we must continue to educate those who do n't understand why we need these protections for abused women			2
democrats and @entity126 in state legislatures around the country recognize the problem and have come together to pass laws that better protect women from gun violence			1
this year alone , leaders in six states -- @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 -- have enacted legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support that will help protect abused women from gun violence			1
faced with laws that do n't do enough to keep guns away from domestic abusers and stalkers , @entity125 and @entity126 chose common - sense change over the status quo			1
opinion : i 'm a gun owner and i want gun control our leaders in @entity139 should follow their example and back legislation that prohibits stalkers and dating abusers from having guns			2
sen. @entity159 of @entity137 , a former prosecutor , has a bill that would do just that			0
it is the responsible thing to do			0
keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and stalkers will take more than a @entity78 hearing and carefully worded statements that say all the right things			1
it will require our leaders to show some courage and stand up for common - sense laws			0
it will require some hard work			0
and it will require overcoming the power of those in @entity139 who continue to fight against these laws			0
but we urgently need stronger gun laws that protect women			2
we ca n't wait any longer			0
women 's lives are at stake			0
join us on @entity186 / @entity185 .			0
