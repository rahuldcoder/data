-- is @entity1 angling for another term as head of world football ? the 77 - year - old vowed at the 2011 @entity7 presidential elections , where he stood unopposed after a bribery controversy ruled out his only rival , that this would be his fourth and final four - year stint in office			1
however , this week he hinted that he has " a mission " to fulfill and said he feels " young enough to be in this office			0
" and he fueled speculation that he may stand again with comments in friday 's release of the @entity17 magazine , in which he said the @entity20 and @entity21 regions deserved more representation at @entity24 finals			1
@entity1 , who has stayed in power since 1998 by vowing to take @entity7 's showpiece tournament to all parts of the world , criticized @entity30 's overwhelming presence in relation to its lesser number of member associations			1
@entity30 will have 13 of the 32 places on offer in @entity36 next year , while @entity37 has four plus the possibility of another via a playoff with fifth - best @entity21 side ( @entity41 vs. @entity42 )			1
@entity43 has five berths , while @entity45 has three plus a playoff with the top @entity48 team ( @entity49 vs. @entity50 )			2
" from a purely sporting perspective , i would like to see globalization finally taken seriously , and the @entity20 and @entity21 national associations accorded the status they deserve at the @entity24 , " @entity1 wrote in an article looking at the future of the sport			1
" it can not be that the @entity60 and @entity37 confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the @entity24 ( 18 or 19 teams ) , because taken together they account for significantly fewer member associations ( 63 ) than @entity43 and @entity21 ( 100 )			1
" @entity1 argues that @entity43 will never fulfill its promise on the biggest stage unless it is given more opportunities			1
" @entity43 , the confederation with the most member associations ( 54 ) , is woefully under - represented at the @entity24 with just five places			1
as long as this remains the case , @entity20 sides may never win an intercontinental trophy , regardless of progress on the playing side , " he said			2
" this flawed state of affairs must be rectified			0
at the end of the day , an equal chance for all is the paramount imperative of elite sport			0
" @entity1 's attempts to curry favor with his traditional powerbase could be seen as the beginning of a bid to sound out support for another tilt at the presidency , according to @entity90 football journalist @entity89			1
" i think that 's @entity1 being @entity1			1
every time he makes a statement there are second thoughts , " she told @entity93			0
" maybe he might be thinking he needs his @entity20 friends to run for a new presidential election			0
he 's trying to be nice to people he needs for a vote			2
" with him you never know , but he works well behind the scenes			0
" having given @entity106 its first staging in 1994 , @entity7 's bid to take the @entity24 to new countries continued two years later , while @entity1 was still its general secretary , when @entity108 and @entity109 were awarded the 2002 tournament -- the first time it was held in @entity21			1
@entity43 's turn came in 2010 when @entity43 was host , and the @entity114 will get a go in 2022 when @entity116 will stage it -- a controversial decision that has led to a likelihood the event will be switched from its traditional summer slot due to the @entity123 state 's intense heat			1
@entity124 will be the first east @entity60 nation to host the @entity24 in 2018 , and it has come under scrutiny already due to the country 's new legislation that many say discriminates against gay people -- @entity7 's statutes forbid this in member nations			1
@entity124 also has a problem with racist behavior by its football fans , which was highlighted this week when @entity137 was charged by @entity60 football 's ruling body @entity30 after @entity140 's @entity139 complained of being targeted with monkey chants			2
@entity139 , whose @entity143 team is hoping to qualify for a third successive @entity24 in @entity36 , suggested a boycott for 2018 if @entity124 could not stamp out its racist elements			2
however , @entity147 manager @entity146 said friday that such an action would be a backward step			0
" i respect his opinion , but i disagree			0
the history of football was made equally by many races			0
and the black players have a fantastic contribution of what football is , " the @entity154 told reporters ahead of his team 's @entity157 clash with @entity140 on sunday			0
" the @entity24 is the biggest expression of national team competitions - races , people from different parts of the globe , people from every continent			1
and the black players are very , very important for that			0
" who is more important , the billions of people in love with the game around the world ? or a few thousand that go to football stadiums and have disgraceful behavior in relation to black players			0
" if i was a black player i would say the other billions are much more important , so let 's fight the thousands , but let 's give to the billions what the billions want			0
and the billions want the best football -- and the best football without black players is not the best football , for sure			0
" @entity1 also said friday that he is against boycotts			2
" @entity194 has never given us any solutions			0
you can not run away from problems , " he told students during an address at @entity201 's @entity200 , where he did not give any more hints about standing for re-election .			2

@entity1 says @entity43 is under - represented at the @entity24 finals
@entity7 president claims the continent 's footballing progress is being held back
@entity1 suggests that @entity30 has too many places at soccer 's showpiece event
comments fuel speculation that the 77 - year - old will stand for re-election in 2015
