@entity1 they are the care - givers who help nurse our nation 's wounded warriors back to health , and some level of self - reliance			1
and until @entity2 got involved , the @entity10 was about to significantly cut their reimbursements for lodging , meals , and incidentals , which allow them to do their important work			1
" my job ( was ) to be with my son pretty much 24/7 , " @entity17 , the mother of sgt. @entity18 , told @entity2			1
@entity18 , an @entity21 senior combat medic , lost both his legs after an improvised explosive device detonated under him in @entity24 , @entity25 , in 2013			2
" not only did my son lose his legs ... but then financially if you got to worry about -- is my house going to be here when i get back from tending to my son , that 's a double whammy , " @entity17 said			2
the @entity10 reimbursement allowed @entity17 to leave her job to care for her son , " and not worry that i could n't pay my mortgage when i came back			1
" the @entity10 classifies caregivers such as @entity17 as @entity36 , or " non-medical attendants			1
" they are sometimes family , or friends , or others , who work with troops who have been severely wounded , often with missing limbs or debilitating brain injuries			1
they treat their wounds , help them re-learn how to stand , or walk , or speak , and nurse them to as much independence as they can achieve			2
all this was at risk when a @entity10 rule went into effect on nov. 1 , 2014 , that sought to eliminate $ 22 million from the budget by discouraging excessive travel for both uniformed and civilian employees of the @entity10			1
that rule would have cut the per diem to 55 % reimbursement for lodging , meals and incidental expenses for those whose work extended beyond six months , or 181 days			1
obviously , the work done by these @entity36 can last far beyond half a year			1
one wounded warrior , worried that the rule change would cost him his caregiver and thus risk his recovery , reached out to @entity2			1
we in turn contacted the @entity10 , demanding to know why these crucial funds were being cut			1
to its tremendous credit , the @entity10 acknowledged the problem and fixed it immediately			1
the original rule was an attempt to discourage unnecessary travel , a spokesperson for @entity10 told @entity2 , but @entity36 got swept up in the rule inadvertently			1
" we want to thank you @entity83 and @entity2 for bringing it to our attention because we had not seen this unintended consequence of what was , in every other respect a very sound an judicious financial policy			1
but you brought it to our attention , " @entity10 spokesman rear admiral @entity90 told us			2
" and we were able to get it changed within a week			0
" @entity36 will continue to be reimbursed as long as they need to be , and those @entity36 affected by the november 2014 budget rule will be able to claim back money spent during that time			2
what would have happened to attendants , and the wounded warriors for whom @entity36 care without that funding ? " i would have had to leave @entity18 and i think his dad would have , too , " @entity17 speculates			1
" we would n't have been able to stay with @entity18 and i 'm sure he would n't be as far along in his recovery and i would say that for anybody			0
they need that help , they really do			0
" nmas take up temporary residence wherever wounded warriors , still in the military , are cared for : at @entity112 , at @entity113 ( @entity113 ) , at @entity114 , @entity115 , at the @entity117 @entity116 , @entity118 , @entity119			1
when the troops transition out of the military , so too do their caregivers			2
because numbers are kept on an installation level , it is difficult to pull together a full number of @entity36			2
there are currently 69 at @entity112 , many of whom are there for more than 30 days			0
@entity113 , @entity131 , and @entity132 have 22 @entity36 , including 17 long - term			2
after staff sgt. @entity135 had his right leg shot off during the @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity25 , in july 2007 , his wife @entity133 had to quit her job as an event planner in @entity141 , @entity119 , and move to a modest hotel on the grounds of @entity112 for 10 months			0
the per diem reimbursements as an @entity36 " gave me the freedom to solely focus on him and his recovery , " she tells @entity2			1
" you want to help them become independent , " she says of her mission			0
but it was a long haul			0
@entity135 had dozens of surgeries on his leg as doctors constantly had to clean the wound , trying to save as much of it as they could			0
she helped him with daily living activities , getting food , using the rest room , and making appointments			0
she became trained in wound care and changing his bandages ; she learned how to administer shots to deal with his blood clots ; she was taught how to administer iv antibiotics to help him with his infections so he did n't have to stay in the hospital			0
she says she ca n't imagine going through that with added financial stresses			0
" you do n't need to be worrying about that sitting next to your husband who saw two guys killed and is bleeding everywhere , " she says			0
it 's even more difficult , @entity133 says , for parents of wounded warriors who become @entity36 , who do n't get the military salaries that couples get			1
such as @entity17 who continues to care for her son sgt. @entity18			0
" at first we pretty much marathoned it with @entity18			0
we would stay there from sunrise to sunset , and beyond , " @entity17 said			0
" having your mom there is important , " @entity18 said			0
" and having my dad there to , you know , wake me up in the middle of the night and keep me calm , that was vital to my recovery			0
" @entity18 has made great strides in regaining his independence			0
he is now out of the hospital , and even dating			0
now , with these funds restored , families like @entity18 's will be able to continue the journey back from battle , together .			2
