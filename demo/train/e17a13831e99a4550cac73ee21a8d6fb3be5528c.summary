-- exploring the heavens with spaceships and fancy orbiting telescopes like the @entity4 is pretty routine stuff for @entity6			1
but the space agency is going low - tech to get a good look at an eagerly anticipated comet			2
the space agency plans to launch a balloon -- yes , a balloon -- to study @entity13 , the much - hyped comet that many hope will put on a big sky show in coming months			1
astronomers are scrambling to figure out ways to learn more about the comet , and that 's where the balloon comes in			2
this is n't the kind of balloon you buy for kids at a party store , but they do have some things in common			0
@entity6 says its scientific balloons are made of polyethylene film like the material in plastic bags , and it will be filled with helium , just like a party balloon			1
but the @entity6 balloons can carry a payload weighing 8,000 pounds ( 3,600 kilograms ) , or about the weight of three small cars			1
it has a gondola to carry the instruments			0
some similar balloons can fly up to 26 miles high and stay for up to two weeks			0
the 671 - foot - tall balloon that will monitor @entity13 is called @entity45 , or @entity46			1
according to @entity6 , it will float about 120,000 feet above @entity48 to observe the comet -- and other science targets -- using a telescope and other instruments			1
it is expected to stay up from nine to 11 hours			0
" by ascending above 99.5 % of the @entity48 's atmosphere , @entity45 will be able to study the materials within the comet , " @entity54 , principal investigator , said on @entity56 's website			0
" it 's possible that water and organic chemicals on comets may have played an important role in the evolution of life on @entity48			0
" the launch , from @entity6 's @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70 , is targeted for 8 p.m. et on saturday , weather permitting			1
@entity13 is nearing @entity72 on its way toward the sun and will fly about 730,000 miles above the sun 's surface on november 8			1
if it survives , it could brighten and put on a big show as it passes @entity48 's orbit on its way back to the outer reaches of the solar system			2
comet enthusiasts hope they will be able to see it without binoculars or telescopes			0
its closest approach to @entity48 would be december 26 , and it could be visible from the @entity89 for weeks in early 2014			0
things to know about @entity13 the comet was discovered by @entity93 astronomers @entity94 and @entity95 in september 2012			2
it is named after their night - sky survey program , the @entity96 , a group of observatories in 10 countries organized to track objects in space			0
amateur astronomers already are posting pictures and making calculations about the comet 's future			0
for those who want to try to track @entity13 themselves , @entity6 has some tips on its @entity13 website .			1

a *giant* @entity6 balloon is being used to get a good look at @entity13
the balloon will rise to 120,000 feet
@entity13 could put on show this *winter*
