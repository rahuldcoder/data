-- the @entity1 finally have their name in lights			1
their @entity5 triumph has lifted a weight from the shoulders of die - hard fans who have been pining for a championship trophy for 45 long years			1
the scrappy @entity1 grabbed the @entity10 's prestigious @entity5 with a 6 - 1 win over the @entity12			1
now @entity13 is rolling out the red carpet for ice hockey 's tenacious new champions , who won a long - elusive crown with @entity20 flair and reality - show grit			1
" i have no words to describe this , " one fan said			0
" other than my children being born and having graduated the @entity27 , this is the single most joyous day of my life			0
" now , he says , he can scratch one more item off his " bucket list			0
" " the mountain has been climbed ! " for him and other @entity1 ' fanatics across @entity35 and in the team 's growing and crazed diaspora , the championship -- the first for the @entity1 since they began play in 1967 -- ended decades of futility for a franchise struggling for success in a sport typically associated with frigid temperatures and icy lakes			1
" we 're no. 1 ! " long - suffering @entity1 fans shouted as they streamed out of the @entity49 after the game on monday night , undaunted by a heavy police presence			1
others formed a mosh pit outside the arena , jumping and smashing into one another other in celebration			0
as of late monday evening , @entity1 police reported a few minor arrests but no major problems			1
the @entity61 @entity60 on @entity62 chronicled the rapture , relief and disbelief from the legions who 've pulled for the team , as one fan put it , " through thick and thin			0
" " i love you my @entity71 , " one elated fan said			0
another did n't know if this was a @entity20 movie or reality : " i still need to be pinched			0
" " an amazing feeling , " another fan said			0
" once an afterthought in the city of showbiz and bright lights , the @entity1 reached the pinnacle of professional hockey in a region long dominated by the @entity88 's @entity87 and @entity89 , baseball 's @entity90 and @entity91 , and football and basketball at @entity94 and @entity95			1
the @entity1 have even been overshadowed by their crosstown @entity98 rival , the @entity97 , which won the @entity5 in 2007 just 14 years after the franchise started			1
this year , @entity1 just edged into the playoffs as the 8th and last seed in the @entity10 's @entity102			1
regarded as a solid and respectable team , chances appeared slim that the team would advance in the grinding post-season play that started two months ago			0
but the black - clad underdogs , led by goalie @entity108 , slew goliaths in several best - of - seven series on their way to glory			1
they humbled the @entity115 , a team that had scored 111 points in this year 's regular season , the most in the league			1
then the @entity1 swept the @entity120 and overpowered the @entity121			1
they dominated the @entity12 , a three - time @entity5 champion , in the first three games of the series , but @entity12 , with great players such as @entity126 , @entity127 , and @entity128 , did n't say die			2
after taking a 3 - 0 lead , the @entity12 beat the @entity1 in the next two games			2
for the @entity1 , the specter of losing the series after taking a 3 - 0 would have been a nightmare for a script that appeared headed to a happy ending			2
but the @entity1 rose to the occasion at the @entity49 on monday night and blocked the @entity12 ' dream of an upset			2
the pace of the game was set in the first period , when the @entity1 scored three goals during a five - minute power play in the first period after the @entity12 ' @entity145 was ejected for boarding			2
that 's when a player is pushed or checked violently into the boards of the rink			0
" i 'm probably going to watch the @entity155 dvd everyday until next season starts , " one person said on the @entity62 fan page			0
@entity108 displayed his usual prowess , winning the @entity158 as most valuable player during the playoffs			1
he outshone @entity12 ' goalie legend @entity161 in the finals , but he deferred credit for the @entity1 ' success to the team			2
for example , @entity166 and @entity167 performed with power and flair			0
@entity171 , longtime player and coach , took over as @entity1 ' coach in december when the team was faltering , and he spurred the team to greater achievement			2
captain @entity177 -- who hoisted the cup before a roaring home crowd at the @entity49 before the trophy passed from one screaming @entity181 to another -- was another cog in the @entity1 ' wheel			2
" you ca n't say enough about this group and how hard they worked , " @entity108 said			2
" i hope everyone realizes how amazing @entity108 is ... he had perhaps the best postseason ever for a goalie , " a man on the fan page said			1
" the @entity1 need to lock him up for the next 10 years ! ! ! " @entity193 flowed freely in the @entity1 ' locker room -- including into the @entity5 itself			1
the team reveled in the fact that it was the first - ever no. 8 seed and lowest seed in the modern era to win the @entity10 championship			0
the mood was much more somber in the @entity12 ' locker room			0
" i 'm not the kind of player that wants to hurt this team , i want to help them , " @entity145 told reporters			0
" they scored three goals in those five minutes			0
" in - depth @entity5 coverage at @entity212 the fan mania is a reminder of that the @entity10 is popular in the @entity215 and the @entity216 , not just in @entity217 and the icy northern @entity219 states			1
the @entity10 's @entity220 , the @entity221 , the @entity222 , the @entity223 , the @entity224 , and the @entity227 sport popular franchises			0
in sunny @entity1 , meanwhile , the high - pitched enthusiasm rippled through the palm trees			2
" this is , " one man told reporters			0
" the best city for hockey			0
" the last time the @entity1 garnered this much attention back home was in the late 1980s and early 1990s , propelled by the league 's all - time top scorer , @entity237			1
" so when are they gon na make the movie about our cup run ? ? ? " one @entity1 ' fanatic said on the @entity62 page			0
@entity244 , share your thoughts on monday 's game @entity0 's @entity248 reported from @entity1 , and @entity0 's @entity249 reported from @entity250 .			1

@entity253 : " i still need to be pinched , " one *disbelieving* fan said
new : this is @entity35 's *2nd* @entity5 ; the @entity97 won in ' 07
new : the @entity1 defeated better teams in the playoffs , including the @entity115
new : one fan says the @entity1 need to " lock up " @entity108 for the next 10 years
