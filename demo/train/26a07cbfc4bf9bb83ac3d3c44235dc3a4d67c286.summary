after a long period of closed beta testing , @entity0 made the beta version of its social network , @entity5 , available to everyone on tuesday			1
@entity5 initially launched this may			2
it 's a search - meets - social networking website that looks more like @entity9 than @entity10 , and has until now been open only to invited @entity0 employees and college students			1
now , everyone with a @entity0 or @entity10 account can access it			1
the sign - up process is effortless -- users simply connect their account with @entity5			1
they can then start sharing content ( e.g. photos , videos , links ) , and comment on other members ' posts			0
@entity5 's forever - scrolling front page , which shows posts from all users , can feel a bit random			2
also , though the site offers categorization by tags , it 's not that easy to find the content you want			0
overall , @entity5 is a solid time - waster at this point			0
as more people join , the site should become more usable , but the question is : with all the social networks and content - sharing sites around , will socl ever reach critical mass ? what do you think ? share your thoughts in the comments below .			0
