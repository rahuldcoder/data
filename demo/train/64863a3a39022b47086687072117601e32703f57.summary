-- the first 3d - printed toy plane will soon jet off to the stratosphere			1
the rocket - powered airplane will reach an altitude of between 25 and 30 kilometers ( 15 to 18 miles ) -- three times higher than the cruising height of commercial airplanes			1
" without doubt , this is the most complicated amateur high - altitude mission ever undertaken , " said @entity9 , head of the @entity11 's @entity10 that is behind the project			2
the components of the airplane have been designed by postgraduate students at the @entity17 and produced using a 3d printer			2
" we do n't know quite what will happen when the big day arrives , but one thing 's for sure -- it 's going to be quite a show , " @entity19 , who also holds the @entity20 for the highest launch of a paper aeroplane , added			0
it took the team four years , thousands of volunteer hours , and $ 60,000 from crowdfunding , to complete the " @entity32			0
" the nickname is short for " @entity34 " and , its inventors say , a reference to the @entity38 star @entity32			0
the rocket will launch from the @entity41 spaceport in @entity42 later this year			1
a helium - filled meteorological balloon will lift the spaceplane to around 20 kilometers above the ground			1
once it reaches that altitude , a rocket motor will fire and push the plane up to 25 kilometers			1
" its going to be doing some very smart things ; collecting data from numerous sources , making decisions in real time , to form its trajectory and landing , " said @entity50 from database software firm @entity51 , which sponsored the project			0
once at the right altitude , the plane will switch to autopilot and glide back to earth , guided by a built - in gps navigation system			0
at the end of its journey , the spaceplane will crash to the ground -- as it has no landing gear .			0

a 3d printed model airplane will reach between 25 and 30 kilometers
the airplane will launch from the @entity41 spaceport in @entity42
it will be lifted by a helium - filled balloon and then powered by a rocket *engine*
