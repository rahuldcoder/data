@entity1 , @entity0 -- he is hailed as a god in his native @entity5 , has been a vital part of the country 's culture since the mid- 70s and is largely considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time			1
@entity13 's crowning achievement was captaining @entity5 to @entity15 glory in 1986			1
now , 11 years since retiring from playing , @entity13 is making a triumphant return to the sport as the @entity19 national coach			1
however , his checkered past has made @entity13 something of a surprise choice			2
the 48 - year - old has regularly courted controversy -- not with - standing his well - publicized drug - addiction			0
his talent has never been in doubt , though , and his performances on a domestic and world stage are the stuff of legend			2
since beginning his career as a 15 - year - old with @entity34 , @entity13 has attracted legions of fans			2
at club level , @entity13 won the @entity19 title with @entity39 , prompting a high - profile move to @entity42 football , where he won the @entity43 with @entity44			1
but it was at @entity46 that his presence was really felt			2
when he arrived , the club were not considered title contenders in @entity50 , but with @entity13 's arrival , the southern side were transformed into one of @entity56 football 's dominant forces			1
during his time with @entity46 , the club won the @entity59 twice , the @entity60 and the @entity61			2
and his status as a national hero was further cemented during his performances in the 1982 , 1986 and 1990 @entity65			0
though he briefly shone in his @entity15 debut in 1982 , before an act of petulance saw him sent off against @entity70 , it was the 1986 tournament in @entity71 that @entity13 made his own			0
@entity13 took the finals by the scruff of the neck , scoring five times , including one of the greatest goals ever scored in the 2 - 1 quarterfinal win over @entity0 -- as well as creating more controversy with his infamous " @entity82 " goal in the same match			0
but his iconic status as a footballer is only outshone by his wild private life			1
his time at @entity46 came to an abrupt end after he was found in possession of cocaine , and his last @entity15 as a player , @entity90 1994 , was beset with controversy , as he was sent home early after failing a drugs test			1
and the @entity13 soap opera has continued after his retirement			0
since quitting in 1997 , he has spent a great deal of time in drug rehabilitation clinics in @entity98 and @entity99 , where he combated his addiction to cocaine			0
he has also been subject to dramatic weight gain , struggling with obesity and eventually undergoing gastric bypass surgery to prevent any further fluctuations in his size			0
in recent years he has also been treated for the affects of alcohol abuse and his health has been a cause for much concern among the world 's sports media			1
he has been hit by hepatitis at least twice and in 2004 he was rushed to hospital after a heart attack , following a cocaine overdose			0
and at times he has even seemed mentally unstable -- in a famous incident the one time chat show fired a gun at media waiting outside his house , hitting and injuring four			0
but , despite the negative stories that have circulated about @entity13 , he is still regarded as a national hero in @entity5			1
no - one can doubt his skills as a player , but it has certainly raised a few eyebrows that he has been put in charge of an @entity5 team that is struggling to hold its own in the @entity15 qualifiers			1
whether he can strategize like a professional manager is yet to be seen , but simply by being @entity13 , he will prove to be a great figurehead for the team .			0

@entity13 is a football legend in @entity5 , one of the world 's greats
his skills at @entity46 and for the @entity5 national side are highly *praised*
he has a *reputation* for leading a wild private life , was addicted to cocaine
