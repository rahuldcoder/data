@entity2 presidential candidates @entity0 and @entity3 said at saturday 's foreign policy debate that they would renew the use of waterboarding , the controversial practice banned by president @entity8			1
" i do n't see it as torture			1
i see it as an enhanced interrogation technique , " @entity0 said			2
his comments were met with loud cheers of support from the debate audience			0
@entity3 , meanwhile , called the practice " very effective " and said @entity8 " is allowing the @entity18 to run the @entity19			2
" after the debate , @entity21 aides told @entity23 that he does not believe waterboarding is torture			1
but this issue does n't divide neatly along party lines			0
during the debate candidates @entity28 and @entity29 outright opposed the practice			1
" waterboarding is torture , " @entity28 said			1
" it 's really un-american to accept , on principle , that we will torture people that we capture			2
" the next day both sen. @entity39 and president @entity8 criticized the pro-waterboarding rhetoric and reaffirmed their opposition to the practice			0
the @entity45 has also been historically inconsistent on this issue			0
although the use of waterboarding was widespread in the aftermath of 9/11 , in the aftermath of @entity51 the @entity45 not only condemned but prosecuted and convicted a number of @entity54 troops and officials for subjecting @entity45 troops to waterboarding			0
so which is it : illicit torture or an acceptable interrogation practice ? and how should we decide ? recently my colleagues @entity67 , visiting assistant professor of law at @entity63 , and @entity64 , a behavioral economist at @entity65 , and i examined the psychology behind how we evaluate enhanced interrogation tactics			1
our experiments revealed several insights that can inform the debate on waterboarding and other so - called enhanced interrogation techniques			2
most countries define torture in terms of pain severity			0
for example , the @entity80 , of which @entity45 is one of many signatories , abjures the use of torture , which it defines as " any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted on a person			0
" this means that , legally speaking , whether waterboarding is illicit torture or an acceptable interrogation practices depends on the amount pain and suffering waterboarding inflicts			1
because most policymakers have never experienced waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation tactics for themselves ( sen. @entity39 aside ) , they must rely on their inexperienced intuitions about how painful these practices seem			1
this task has become all the more difficult with the advent of enhanced interrogation techniques such as prolonged sleep deprivation , social isolation , and exposure to cold temperatures , which are designed to induce physical and psychological distress without inflicting enduring harm			0
yet over the past 15 years , psychologists have discovered that people who are n't enduring a painful experience have a hard time estimating just how painful it is			1
this finding is known as an empathy gap , and it helps to explain why doctors underestimate their patients ' pain and why patients themselves underestimate how painful upcoming procedures will be			0
to test the idea that empathy gaps might distort the evaluation of torture policy , we asked people to evaluate common enhanced interrogation tactics like sleep deprivation , solitary confinement , and exposure to cold temperatures			1
some participants ( the control group ) evaluated these practices under normal conditions , while others ( the experimental group ) made their judgments while experiencing a mild version of the pain associated with those techniques			0
these participants submerged their hand in ice water ( exposure to cold temperatures ) , felt social exclusion by being rejected by a group ( solitary confinement ) , and were tested at the end of a three - hour night class ( sleep deprivation )			0
in each case the experimental group estimated the interrogation tactics to be significantly more painful , less ethical , and less acceptable as a practice than participants who made their judgments free of pain , as policymakers normally would			1
these findings suggest that policymakers ( and the concerned public ) suffer from a fundamental bias when evaluating waterboarding and other interrogation tactics			2
it appears that the legal standard for evaluating torture is psychologically untenable			0
policymakers simply can not appreciate the severity of interrogation practices they themselves have not experienced , a psychological constraint that in effect encourages torture			2
indeed , in several well - publicized incidents , public figures who denied that waterboarding was torture volunteered to experience it themselves , and almost instantly changed their minds			1
in combination , a range of empirical evidence points to the need for a more restrictive legal standard for evaluating the ethicality of interrogation techniques .			0

three @entity2 presidential candidates say waterboarding is not a form of torture
so which is it : illicit torture or an acceptable interrogation practice ? asks @entity194
@entity194 : people who do n't experience something ca n't estimate just how painful it is
people who volunteer to experience waterboarding see it as torture , @entity194 says
