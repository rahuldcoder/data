-- forget brain - training exercises , 12 - hour shifts and those long , uninterrupted , caffeine - fueled study binges			1
when you really need new information to sink in , you ca n't skimp on taking breaks , new research suggests			0
that 's the message from a study by psychologists and neuroscientists at the @entity12 , in @entity13 , who asked a small group of normally aging elderly men and women to recall as many details as possible from two stories they were told			1
following one of the stories ( but not always the same one for all the participants ) , the men and women were instructed to relax , take a brief break and close their eyes for 10 minutes in a dark room			1
following the other story , those same participants were instead distracted with a new task , spotting the differences between pairs of nearly identical images			2
overall , the study participants remembered many more details of whichever story they heard before they were told to rest — and their striking memory boost persisted even a full week out after the story - telling			1
take heed , students , doctors and anyone else who has to process large amounts of information : the elderly may worry most about memory , but given what we know about how memories form , these new findings have implications for people of all ages			2
@entity0 : quizzes help the brain learn previous research has already shown that both the young and the old have better recall of , say , a list of words if they 're allowed to rest for a few minutes in between learning the words and then regurgitating them			2
what this latest study adds , however , is evidence that a few minutes of wakeful rest may have an effect even on long - term memory consolidation			1
in fact , when we first encounter new information , it seems , we are probably " just at a very early stage of memory formation , " according to @entity73 , the research fellow who is first author on the new study			1
" further neural processes have to occur after this stage for us to be able to remember this information at a later point in time , " she told reporters			2
those neural processes do n't have to be consciously planned , however			0
research on rats has shown the animals will " re-play " in their brains the things that have just happened to them — things like walking through a maze — if they are given some idle time			0
scans of human brains suggest that people do the same thing , and , importantly , that this brain activity occurs automatically , without people having to think about it			0
the volume of that brain activity is then linked to memory retention later			2
@entity0 : want to sharpen your mind ? drop a few pounds similarly , there is a growing body of evidence on the crucial role of sleep in memory consolidation			0
the precise mechanisms are not well understood , but sleep seems important both for " declarative " memory ( remembering facts ) and especially for " procedural " memory — remembering how to do things , like learning to ride a bike or to play scales on a piano			0
in fact , it 's even been suggested that sleep 's major role in procedural memory is the reason that infants spend most of their lives asleep ; they need that time , perhaps , to consolidate new memories about how to control their young bodies			0
@entity0 : are e-books harder to remember ? but if resting , either while awake or asleep , is so important for memory consolidation , then it 's unfortunate there seem to be so very many distractions everywhere we turn			1
" in this day and age of information overload there are few opportunities to sit back and rest , " @entity73 and her colleagues write in their new paper , to be published in @entity135			0
whether at work or at school , to learn new tasks well , it may help to schedule in some genuine down time			0

researchers in @entity13 asked study participants to remember details of two stories
those who shut their eyes for 10 minutes in a dark room remember more than others
memory boost lasted a full week after the study took place
