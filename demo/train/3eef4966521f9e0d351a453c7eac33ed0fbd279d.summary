@entity0 -- as the sun sets , clouds of smoke begin to glow deep orange and pink			1
i watch as flames leap from the dark silhouettes of trees and embers are flung high into the night sky			0
i look over the forest that i have watched day in and day out for almost 15 months			1
as fire throws an eerie glow across my upper canopy home , i say goodbye			1
it was over a year ago that i first climbed a rope 60 meters to the top of an old growth @entity21 in @entity0 's @entity22 and vowed to remain at that lofty height until the forest was protected			1
for 449 days , i lived in constant uncertainty about when it would be that i would return to the ground			1
but i never imagined it would be like this			0
in early march , a fire started within two kilometers of my tree - sit			1
it was so close that any change in the wind direction could have brought the flames to my tree within minutes , and i may not have made it out of there alive			1
i had to get down			0
early police investigations found the fire was deliberately lit. that first moment my feet touched earth was incredible and overwhelming			1
i clung to my climbing rope and did n't want to let go			0
after being attached physically to the tree by that rope for so long , it was a big step to take to finally let go and walk through the forest			1
the next big step was the car , which , after only moving as far as the tree could sway for all those months , felt like i was suddenly hurtling along at the speed of light			1
then there was an even bigger step -- the house			0
being surrounded by four walls and a roof again was certainly something to get used to			0
while i now hold the @entity61 record for the longest ever tree - sit , it was never about records			1
i went up that tree and remained there for one reason -- to protect @entity0 's unique , ancient forests that were , and still are , under threat from industrial scale logging			1
in early february , the @entity61 government made a nomination to include 124,000 hectares of threatened @entity0 forest into the existing @entity73			1
when i heard the news i sat and watched as honey eaters and pardalotes hopped from branch to branch around me , imagining what it would feel like to descend from the tree knowing this forest would never be logged			2
within days the reality began to be exposed around the state logging was continuing unabated in those forests nominated for @entity73			1
in response to protests for the logging to stop , @entity0 's deputy premier @entity85 said that it was only occurring in a small number of coupes where " existing harvesting operations " were being completed			1
clearly , the fight was far from over			2
and so , i renewed my determination -- i would stay in the tree for as long as it takes			2
after preparing myself to stay in the upper canopy of that magnificent tree for an indefinite period of time , the abrupt end of my action was a shock and something i am still coming to terms with			1
i do not regret one single day being in the tree tops			2
i am proud of what i have achieved in bringing an international spotlight to these spectacular forests			2
i ca n't say it was always easy			0
there were certainly times when i wondered what on earth i was doing on a tiny platform in the middle of a wild forest , exposed to storms , wind , rain and snow			0
however , through all the challenges the beauty of the forest shone through			0
i watched the forest change through all four seasons , as the tree exploded with flowers in summer right through to seeing the entire forest carpeted in thick white snow in the middle of winter			2
i was lucky enough to have a solar panel and @entity132 to communicate to the world , allowing me to @entity134 my way into conferences , festivals and school groups as well as update a blog about life in the tree			2
for all this technology and communication , the isolation of being alone in the tree tops was often overwhelming			2
the tree became my closest companion , along with the birds , skunks and many beetles that shared my upper canopy home			2
while i was in the tree i had thought many times about how much i missed my friends and family and how amazing it would be when i finally reach the earth again and can spend time with them			0
now i begin to realize how i was never really alone in that tree			0
being on the ground has its advantages of course , and i have enjoyed my first hot bath and sleeping in a proper bed			0
but there is a hard side to it too , and i miss the tree and the birds more than i could have imagined			0
i miss the daily visits from the curious currawongs who would hop around on my platform			0
i miss watching the trees sway in the wind			0
i miss the sound of boo - book owls calling gently across the moonlit valley			0
i miss the constant presence of the tree by my side			0
i may be on the ground but i am no less determined to continue this fight			1
i will be doing everything i can from the ground to keep the pressure up on the industry and the @entity61 government			0
now that the government has recommended these areas for internationally recognized protection , it is even more critical that people around the globe take a stand to ensure these ancient forests survive for the future			0
