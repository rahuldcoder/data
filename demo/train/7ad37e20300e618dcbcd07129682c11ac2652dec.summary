a @entity8 worker handing out hiv / aids drugs in @entity4			1
the study produced by leading international humanitarian organization , @entity8 said the failure by the government to provide hiv / aids treatment to its people is putting the population at risk			1
an estimated 240,000 people are thought to have @entity3 in @entity4 with 76,000 of those people facing death unless they receive antiretroviral ( @entity23 ) drug , the report published tuesday said			1
fewer than 20 percent of the people are are able to access art , according to the organization			0
currently , @entity8 says it is almost the sole provider of these lifesaving drugs -- providing them to more than 11,000 people			1
" it is unacceptable that a single ngo is treating the vast majority of @entity3 patients in a crisis of this magnitude , " the charity 's operations manager @entity29 , said in a press release			0
the pressure on its resources means the charity has been forced to turn away patients			0
" sometimes i wake up at midnight and dream of my patients			0
women who come in are @entity3 positive -- they have three children at home and the husband has passed away and we can not provide any treatment for them , " a doctor quoted in the research said			0
the government and international communities have provided very little to the crisis , @entity29 added			0
the government of @entity4 allocated just $ 200,000 for @entity3 in 2008 , which is one of the lowest amount spent worldwide , according to @entity8			1
drugs that are not provided by aid organizations or the government cost a patient $ 29 per month			0
with most people in @entity4 living on an average of $ 1.20 per day , the cost of drugs is unaffordable for most			2
the charity also appealed for intervention by the international community to avert the crisis			2
@entity4 currently receives around $ 3 per person in aid -- one of the lowest rates worldwide			0
one reason for this may be that international donor groups are reluctant to send aid to @entity4 , a country run by a strict military junta widely criticized for its atrocious human rights record			2
the report states aid agencies may be put off by challenges @entity4 imposes such as strict constraints and difficult bureaucratic procedures			2
earlier this year when a deadly cyclone hit @entity4 that killed almost 100,000 people and left millions homeless , the government turned away international aid to the frustration of many organizations			1
@entity8 has been providing essential healthcare services in @entity4 since 1993 and began an integrated program in 2003 to support people living with @entity3 .			1
