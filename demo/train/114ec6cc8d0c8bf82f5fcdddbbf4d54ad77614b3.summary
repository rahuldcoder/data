customers also can make a partial payment reflecting what they think is appropriate , and then wait for the exact reading to pay the difference , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity9 said			1
the announcement came after outraged customers questioned why they were receiving electricity bills @entity17 that reflected a full month 's use of electricity , even though many were without power for days or weeks			1
the utility had said monday that it was sending out bills based on customers ' estimated usage of the same month last year , because it had reassigned its meter readers to help with power restoration efforts after @entity6			1
" ( the ) next actual meter reading will reflect the amount of electricity ( customers ) have used since ( their ) previous actual meter reading , and it will automatically adjust ... charges , " @entity9 told @entity1 on monday			1
