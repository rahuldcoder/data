-- racism is headline news again			1
this time , @entity4 's conversation on race is focused on whether @entity6 is a racist -- and on his apology			1
but i 'm not clear where we go with that conversation : it feels like a never - ending cycle of accusation and defense and less about long - lasting solutions			1
after all , @entity6 is invested in not being seen as a racist and saving his business			1
when a debate becomes about whether one person is racist , what are the rest of us supposed to do with that ? if we want to have a more useful discussion on how to move beyond racism in @entity4 , there are more productive ways to do it			1
first , we have to resist concluding that condemning racist slurs is all that is required to end discrimination			1
second , to achieve racial equity , we need to be able to do three things : talk explicitly about race ; focus on the impact of policies and practices and the intentions behind them ; and support power - building in marginalized communities			1
racism has evolved over the past 50 years , and our collective understanding of what constitutes justice , how discrimination functions and how to best address it needs updating			1
racial bias is often hidden , unintentional and systemic			1
that means that it is actually possible to create racist impact , even if there 's no easily identifiable racist behind the curtain			1
the notion that racism is always intentional , individual and overt feeds the false assumption that colorblindness is then the appropriate solution			1
but the absence of apparent , or even coded , hostility does not necessarily indicate the presence of fairness			1
that 's why we have to be able to ask explicit racial questions			1
rather than avoiding racial difference , we should engage it , with the goal of creating actual equity in our workplaces , schools and all the other spaces in which we spend our lives			1
in the food industry , for example , there is widely accepted racial hierarchy in high - end restaurants			2
anyone walking into a three - star restaurant can see that often , the people who have speaking parts at the front of the house are white , while those working for lower wages in the back of the house are employees of color			2
the @entity93 ( @entity94 ) has documented such segregation in @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			2
the organization has challenged prominent restaurant owners and chains to address racial exclusion through new employment practices , which often involve actually formalizing hiring practices such as posting jobs internally first before going external or holding performance reviews			2
@entity107 works against equity by making room for all kinds of problematic individual judgments , such as discrimination against applicants with @entity115 foreign accents			2
the lack of rules is in itself a kind of policy			2
a good example is @entity121 , the owner of craft and a host of " top chef			2
" he has a combination of formal employment practices and full intention to build an integrated workforce			2
@entity129 of @entity130 notes that @entity121 " has a good reputation among workers in the industry for being a conscientious employer in this regard , and diners in his restaurants get a visibly different experience of the workforce			2
" an employer 's clear intention to make room for people of color and willingness to apply that intention to recruitment , hiring , training and promotion of employee is the combination that enables real change			0
the second thing we need to create genuine racial equity is to look at the impact of our institutional practices			0
when the rules of an institution are written down , we call them policies , but unwritten rules also shape institutions , in the form of repeated individual behavior , traditions , rituals or common approaches to problems			0
senate majority leader @entity170 called for the @entity171 to take a stand against owner @entity173 -- who insists on preserving a team name that many consider racially insensitive -- the way the @entity178 did against @entity6			1
@entity173 has continued to defend his recalcitrance in the name of " tradition " and to prove his lack of animus toward native people by establishing a foundation			0
if i stretch , i can accept that @entity173 has no real animus toward @entity188			0
yet , the fact is that stereotypical sports mascots dehumanize the people they represent			0
holding onto such a symbol bolsters an image of native people on which other people negatively act			0
lastly , we have to recognize that people who have been marginalized need power to generate racial equality			1
the tools that create the presence of equity , not just the absence of hostility , have little chance of being implemented in situations where people of color are not organized for collective power			0
one such tool is the @entity212 , which allows us to predict bad outcomes and change course			0
it works like an environmental impact analysis , which requires any building project to account for potential pollution , noise , traffic and other environmental factors			0
this worked in @entity223 , when the @entity224 , a coalition of communities of color , pressed the school board to conduct a racial impact review of proposed school closings			0
in a rare reversal , the analysis led them to cancel the closing of a community school serving @entity236 students and to expand the school options available to @entity188			0
now , the @entity238 has adopted a policy of conducting impact analysis on all decisions that affect student learning and resource allocation			0
none of that would have happened if communities of color were n't organizing themselves			0
if we want racial equity , we have to want that kind of power - building , too			0
as we debate issues such as voting rights and affirmative action , the effect on a community 's ability to assert its interests has to be part of our calculation of what makes good policy			0
as a nation , we 've come a long way on race , as evidenced by the fact that @entity6 was not only condemned by individuals but also sanctioned by an institution			1
there 's nothing stopping us from using these news stories to launch a forward - looking , highly effective , unifying approach to our persistent racial problems			1
we can generate fairness -- not just punish hostility -- if we have the courage to be explicit , focus on the rules and their impact and encourage power building among people of color			0
that 's what it means to be brave			0
it 's an @entity4 virtue			0
we can feel encouraged to see it in action every day , and we should never stop pushing for more			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity289			1

comments by *public* figures such as @entity6 have provided fuel to discuss race
more could be learned from these *incidents* , says race forward *president* @entity289
@entity289 : *honesty* about race and *empowerment* of the marginalized are key
