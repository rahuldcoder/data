-- the current round of fighting between the @entity3 and the @entity4 , or @entity5 , in @entity6 has been raging for over three weeks			1
both sides have suffered casualties -- the numbers are much higher on the @entity11 side , as they always are			0
the @entity11 death toll has exceeded 1,000 , while the @entity13 have suffered fewer than 50			2
there are many reasons for the huge disparity , not the least of which are the facts that the ground combat is taking place in densely populated @entity6 , and the effectiveness of the @entity13 anti-rocket / missile system known as @entity24			1
despite calls by the @entity26 , the @entity27 and the @entity29 secretary of state , fighting not only continues , but has escalated in the last few days			2
@entity13 airstrikes , missile and artillery attacks , and naval gunfire have increased in tempo and lethality			2
the targets of the @entity13 attacks have also expanded into areas normally considered to be off - limits , such as the @entity41 mosque in @entity42 , struck during the early morning hours of july 29			2
that same night saw attacks on the @entity5 - run @entity45 radio station and homes of senior @entity5 officials			2
this expands the target set beyond pure military targets and goes to the political structure of @entity5			2
the sole electrical power plant in @entity6 was also in flames ; there are conflicting reports as to the actual cause			0
the @entity13 claim that a @entity5 rocket malfunctioned and landed short in the facility , while the @entity11 claim it was @entity13 tank fire			1
in any case , the infrastructure of @entity6 is being severely damaged			0
so , how does this end ? if one was to look at the previous conflicts in 2008 and 2012 , there would be a @entity66 resolution and a cease - fire with conditions accepted by both sides			0
the fighting stops , repairs to the infrastructure begin and everyone hopes that this cease - fire will hold longer than the last one			0
there seems to be less willingness on both sides to look for the " usual " way out of the armed confrontation			0
the @entity13 continue their operations despite withering international criticism over the high number of civilian casualties in @entity6 ; they appear intent on achieving their stated goals of destroying the @entity5 tunnels that threaten communities and kibbutzim inside @entity13 close to the @entity6 frontier , and reducing , if not eliminating , @entity5 ' substantial rocket inventory			1
on the other side , @entity5 is also committed to continue the fight			0
despite the surprising effectiveness of @entity13 's @entity24 anti-rocket system , which has dramatically blunted @entity5 ' main threat to @entity13 , @entity5 continues to fire rockets at @entity13 cities			1
on the ground , the group appears to have adopted some of the tactics that @entity102 used effectively against @entity13 forces in southern @entity104 during the 2006 fighting			0
there are more ambushes , use of improvised explosive devices and tunnels to attack @entity13 soldiers			2
opinion : five lessons of the @entity6 war there is another consideration influencing @entity5 ' decision to continue the fight			1
@entity5 knows that it will be much harder to re-arm after the end of this round of hostilities			1
the main sources of its rocket arsenal and other weapons have been @entity125 and @entity126 -- @entity5 ' longest range rocket is the @entity126 - made @entity128 , capable of reaching targets 100 miles away			0
the weapons traditionally are smuggled into @entity6 via a series of tunnels on the @entity26 border , after being smuggled from ports in @entity134 and transported across the @entity135			1
with the removal of the government of president @entity138 in @entity26 , @entity5 has lost a valuable ally and source of political support			1
the new @entity26 government of former defense chief @entity144 @entity143 has beefed up its military presence on the border with @entity6 and dismantled many of the tunnels into @entity6			1
@entity143 considers @entity5 to be nothing more than a branch of the @entity151 , which he has outlawed in @entity26			1
@entity5 can not expect assistance from that quarter as it has in the past			0
at some point , the fighting will end			0
as i said , though , this time it is different			0
rather than the result of @entity27 - brokered cease - fire and agreement , in my assessment it will end when the @entity13 have inflicted what they believe is enough damage to @entity5 to render it militarily ineffective			1
this means the destruction of @entity5 ' rocket inventory and the destruction of all the tunnels @entity13 forces can find			1
only then will @entity13 quit			0
prime minister @entity177 has told the @entity13 people to expect a long fight in @entity6 : " we will not finish the mission , we will not finish the operation , without neutralizing the tunnels ... which have the sole purpose of destroying our citizens , killing our children			1
" i would take him at his word			0
join us on @entity183 / @entity182 .			0

in some ways , @entity6 conflict fits pattern of earlier *clashes* , but this one is different
@entity191 says @entity13 seems determined to render @entity5 militarily ineffective
@entity5 knows it will be much harder to re-arm *due* to @entity26 's opposition
@entity191 : @entity177 seems fixed on idea of neutralizing @entity5 ' tunnels
