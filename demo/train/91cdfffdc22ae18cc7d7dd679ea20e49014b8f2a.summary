a hint of @entity3 's expected response to the @entity5 slaughter -- and a claim of responsibility by @entity8 for the rampage that claimed 12 lives -- came in remarks president @entity12 made aboard his country 's nuclear - powered @entity14 aircraft carrier before it embarked to the @entity17			1
" the exceptional situation that we 're in must lead us to revise our rhythm for reducing personnel , " @entity12 said wednesday , referring to military cuts planned before the attacks			2
that exceptional situation was a terrorist rampage that was years in the works , an @entity8 leader said in a video , claiming @entity28 - born cleric @entity27 was the mastermind			1
@entity29 was the terror group 's spokesman before a @entity28 drone strike killed him in @entity32 in 2011			1
as intelligence analysts try to piece together whether the gunmen who attacked the satirical magazine met @entity36 on trips to @entity32 -- a theory that could be bolstered by the new video 's claim -- @entity3 's ultimate response will be colored by numerous factors			1
why deploy the @entity14 ? an invasion of @entity32 is unlikely			0
" in terms of international engagement and what 's happening in @entity32 , the @entity28 has been engaged in drone strikes for a number of years , " says @entity44 , director of the @entity45 and a professor of public policy at @entity48			2
" i would think the @entity28 is doing about everything that could be done in @entity32			0
" of @entity3 's deployment of the flagship @entity14 , @entity44 said : " i do n't know how much of this is symbolic or adding to capability			1
i just have my doubts			0
" in fact , @entity44 wrote in an op - ed piece this week , @entity3 and the @entity28 have been on a " war footing " against terrorism for nearly 14 years			1
" as early as october 2001 , @entity3 participated in @entity65 operations in @entity66 against @entity67 and the @entity68 , " he wrote			1
" in 2013 , @entity3 launched a military operation in @entity70 against an @entity67 affiliate that had overtaken large swaths of the country			1
and last year , @entity3 joined the @entity28 - led military engagement against @entity75 in @entity76 and @entity77			1
" on saturday , prime minister @entity78 declared that @entity3 was at " war against terrorism , against jihadism , against radical @entity82			1
" the attacks and the international response they have elicited evoke the days following the 9/11 attacks , @entity87 , a political science professor at @entity48 , wrote in @entity88			2
" this problem is best understood using the language of war , " he wrote			0
" yes , it requires all of the tools of diplomacy , law enforcement , intelligence , and so on , but they are all components of a larger frame that is war			0
" will @entity3 go to war ? @entity3 has moved more and more in the direction of military force against terrorists overseas in recent years , @entity101 , associate director of the @entity98 and @entity99 at the @entity100 , said via email			1
that 's a change from a decade ago , when the nation tended to focus primarily on the domestic front in counterterrorism strategy			2
an important factor is recognition that the nature of the terror threat has grown increasingly complex , with links to overseas terrorist safe havens , according to @entity101			2
@entity101 said the case of @entity117 , who killed seven people in a series of attacks in southern @entity3 in 2012 , was influential			1
@entity117 was shot dead after a long siege in @entity122 that year			0
@entity117 told police he had attended an @entity8 training camp while visiting @entity66 and @entity125 , according to a @entity3 prosecutor			1
@entity117 's relatives denied the claim			2
" @entity3 's decision to intervene against @entity130 in @entity70 in 2013 was shaped by this growing concern about the ways that overseas terrorist safe havens increase the threat to @entity3 itself , " @entity101 said			1
( " @entity136 " refers to @entity135			0
) " all of this suggests that , contrary to what might have been the case a decade ago , a @entity3 counterterrorism operation against @entity8 is a real possibility			1
" is a large @entity3 operation likely ? you probably wo n't see a repeat of @entity70 , where @entity3 had 2,150 soldiers on the ground and 1,000 more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere			1
instead , @entity3 might chose to use special operations forces , which have been working closely with the @entity150 in recent years , or even air strikes against specific targets , according to @entity101			1
" from a @entity3 perspective , airstrikes have the additional benefit of being high - profile and showcasing @entity3 airpower , " he wrote			1
" @entity157 was used to great effect in @entity70			0
@entity3 ( special operations forces ) performed well in @entity70 , however , when it came to the element of surprise and keeping the initiative against a retreating @entity8 foe			1
" for @entity3 , an international and domestic response are in order			1
" in both cases , @entity3 can not go it alone , but needs allies like the @entity28 to back it up , " @entity101 said			1
" there are always risks that such operations can backfire , and i 'm sure that @entity3 leaders are doing their best to weigh those risks against the risks of not responding			1
" has the military option worked ? it depends on the goals , experts say			2
" has it led to the destruction of @entity8 ? no , " @entity44 said			0
" has it prevented any 9/11 - sized attacks in the @entity28 or anywhere else in the world ? the answer to that question is no as well			0
" the effectiveness of the military approach is hard to measure			2
" @entity29 has been taken off the battlefield , " @entity44 said			0
" he was a very threatening individual and , even in his death , is having influence			0
some of the things that were done there have contributed and maybe helped to contain this organization but it has n't led to its elimination			0
" and the rise of @entity75 in @entity77 is instructional			0
" we did think when @entity197 was killed and @entity8 central was really strongly wounded that maybe we were on the down slope of this problem , but the civil war in @entity77 has really been a game changer , @entity44 told @entity1			0
what can @entity3 do at home ? in his op - ed piece , @entity44 wrote that @entity3 should revise laws to make support for foreign terrorist organizations , whether fighting or training with them , a crime punishable by a lengthy period of incarceration			1
" in the @entity28 , our ' material support for terrorism ' law has been an effective tool for incapacitating potential terrorists , " he wrote			2
" the law is only triggered by specific actions taken in furtherance of terrorist organizations			0
if applied properly , it does not violate civil liberties by punishing people for their ideas			0
" toughening criminal laws will expand the scope of surveillance against people with terrorist connections , according to @entity44			0
" can every single person that has radical impulses be arrested and prosecuted in a democracy ? no , " he told @entity1			0
" but people who have known connections and have in some way interacted with foreign terrorist organizations , to me that 's a crime and we should consider locking more people up			0
that 's not a long - term response to this problem that the whole world is facing , but it is something that can reduce the immediate level of risk that they 're facing			1
" @entity253 , 32 , and @entity254 , 34 , who authorities say carried out the @entity5 shootings , were killed during a standoff northeast of @entity257 last week			2
the brothers were @entity3 citizens known to the country 's security services , according to officials			1
one spent time in jail for ties to terrorism , and was in @entity77 as recently as this summer , according to a @entity3 source			1
the other went to @entity32 for training , officials say			0
before they were killed in a shootout with @entity3 security forces , one of the brothers spoke on the phone to a journalist from the @entity3 news network @entity275			2
" we are just telling you that we are the defenders of @entity278 , " he said			0
" i was sent , me , @entity253 , by @entity8 in @entity32			0
i went there and @entity280 financed my trip ... before he was killed			0
" @entity253 , the younger of the brothers , was arrested by @entity3 authorities in 2005 when he was about to leave to fight in @entity76			2
he planned to travel to @entity76 via @entity77			0
he was sentenced to three years in prison in 2008			0
@entity44 wrote : " the key steps @entity3 needs to take to address the current threat have everything to do with expanding domestic counterterrorism and little to do with the tools of war			2
