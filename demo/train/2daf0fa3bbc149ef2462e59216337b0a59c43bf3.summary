for much of the past decade , @entity1 's nuclear weapons development program has been one of the top national security concerns for the @entity4			1
even as we fought wars in @entity7 and @entity8 and hunted down @entity10 's leaders , @entity4 intelligence officers , military and top diplomats have been working round the clock to prevent @entity1 from developing the bomb			1
an @entity1 armed with nuclear weapons , capable of threatening @entity16 and other regional states , would touch off a nuclear arms race in the world 's most volatile region			1
it would be an unmitigated disaster			0
we must make all efforts to prevent this			0
for this reason , i have pressed for ever - tightening sanctions to isolate @entity1 from the global economy and have supported a policy that leaves all options on the table , including military force			1
the stakes are simply too high to risk any miscalculation of our resolve by @entity1 's leaders			1
in pushing for ever more punitive sanctions , we held out the hope that by increasing the economic pressure enough , we might be able to force @entity1 to give up its nuclear weapons ambition and rejoin the community of nations			1
now , we are at a moment in the standoff with @entity45 that will test that assumption			0
opinion : why @entity16 , @entity49 states are wary of @entity1 nuclear talks in repeated statements since his election as @entity1 's new president in june , president @entity51 expressed interest in exploring a negotiated end to the sanctions in exchange for walking back its nuclear program and a verifiable inspections to ensure compliance			1
the just - concluded @entity65 meeting , though unsuccessful in achieving a breakthrough on an interim deal , reportedly came close			0
the @entity1 and the @entity67 group will be reconvening there this week for a second round			2
in the meantime , there have been calls for the @entity73 to continue work on a new round of sanctions that was passed by the @entity77 with my support earlier this year			2
advocates of this approach say that sanctions brought us to this point and passage of a new round of sanctions during the negotiations will improve the likelihood of success at the bargaining table			2
president @entity93 and @entity4 secretary of state @entity94 have asked for more time to test @entity1 's willingness to enter into a tough and verifiable process of ending its nuclear weapons program , and i think we should give it to them			1
the sanctions have succeeded in forcing @entity1 to the table , and a further round right now -- when it has the potential to derail the negotiations -- is unnecessary			1
we will know soon enough whether the @entity1 regime is serious about a new direction in its nuclear program and its relationship with the @entity109			1
if it is not , there will be ample opportunity to tighten the stranglehold on @entity1 's economy , and further sanctions will have my full support			1
@entity4 - @entity16 rift over @entity1 nukes now in the open @entity16 prime minister @entity119 has raised the concern that any relaxation of sanctions in an interim deal risks unraveling the whole sanctions regime			1
this is not an illusory concern , and for this reason , any partial lifting of the freeze on @entity1 assets must be quickly reversible if the @entity1 balk on a final deal			2
but the absence of an interim deal is also problematic if it means another six months of @entity1 enrichment			2
the @entity1 must be made to understand that if they walk away or cheat , the sanctions will be tightened to the point of strangulation -- and the international community must be prepared to make good on that threat			2
i have no illusions about the character of the @entity1 regime , nor do i trust it			0
i do not believe that we can look into @entity51 's eyes and see the truth , let alone his soul			0
even if @entity51 was serious about his intentions , there is no guarantee that @entity1 's @entity152 , ayatollah @entity153 , would bless any agreement with the international community that forces @entity1 to verifiably foreswear development of the bomb			1
i share the concerns that have been expressed by others here , in @entity16 and in the @entity160			0
ultimately , this is not about trust			0
it 's not about making concessions to @entity1 or rewarding the mullahs for thwarting the will of the international community for many years			2
it is about seizing the opportunity to see whether we can end @entity1 's nuclear weapons program without resorting to military action			1
and if we can not , no doubt will remain that the @entity4 made every effort to resolve this grave threat diplomatically			0
no negotiation is without risk , and the @entity1 ' track record is cause for great skepticism			0
the administration must not accept a bad deal -- and any interim agreement that provides sanctions relief must be easily and quickly reversible			0
but neither should the administration be prevented from testing whether it can obtain a good deal that advances our security interests and those of our allies			0
@entity192 , the former @entity16 prime minister who signed the @entity193 two decades ago , once noted that " you make peace with your enemies -- not the @entity197 of @entity198			0
" i agree and urge us to give diplomacy a chance .			0

rep. @entity204 : @entity1 's nuclear program has been a top national security concern for 10 years
@entity204 : *escalating* sanctions were meant to force @entity1 into a deal , and @entity1 is at the table
he says another round of sanctions could derail negotiations and is unnecessary
@entity204 : we must seize this chance ; if it fails , there would be no doubt we tried diplomatically
