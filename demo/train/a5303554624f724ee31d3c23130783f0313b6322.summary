-- as @entity2 has recently calculated , there is a real possibility that the @entity5 primary process could fail to yield a majority winner			0
what would happen then ? journalists like to speculate about " brokered conventions " : the kind of conventions we had 50 and 100 years ago , where party bosses chose presidential nominees in smoke - filled rooms			2
but you ca n't have a " brokered convention " in a system where there are no " brokers			1
" here 's an example of how the old system worked : in 1952 , most rank - and - file republicans wanted to nominate sen. @entity24 of @entity25 , the leader of the party 's conservative wing			1
in the dozen or so primaries and caucuses held that year , @entity24 won nearly 2.8 million @entity5 votes , as compared with only 2 million for @entity32			0
but about three - quarters of the states had neither primaries nor caucuses			2
their delegates were chosen at state party conventions , and those delegates answered to powerful state officeholders , typically the state governor			2
so when the @entity5 convened in @entity42 in 1952 , those powerful state officeholders could negotiate among themselves , confident that they controlled the delegate count from their state			2
that 's how @entity32 won in 1952			2
the two most powerful @entity5 governors in the country -- @entity48 of @entity49 and @entity50 of @entity51 -- preferred @entity32 , and so @entity32 it was			0
that 's not how it would happen today			2
modern governors do not control their state parties the way governors did in the 1950s			0
and today 's delegates wo n't do as they are told			1
what would happen today ? two possible scenarios : 1 ) imagine that @entity61 falls just slightly short of the 1144 needed to nominate			1
in this scenario , an individual party chairman from a smaller state with more old - fashioned rules might be lured to find some way to redirect his state 's votes to @entity61			1
that is what happened in 1976 , when @entity71 narrowly defeated @entity72 by gaining the last - minute support of the @entity75 state delegation ; that 's the most recent occasion when a convention chose a nominee			1
the problem is that there are many fewer such old - fashioned states today than there were in 1976 , with the result that the price such " available " states might be able to exact will be considerably higher than it was back then			0
@entity86 only needed to replace his vice presidential candidate , dumping @entity89 , anathema to party conservatives , in favor of @entity92 , then a conservative hero			0
but what price would be exacted from @entity61 ? and what effect would that have on the election ? @entity61 badly needs to pivot back to the center for the general election			1
would a convention - season deal to get the votes of strongly conservative delegates veto that pivot and doom his hopes ? 2 ) imagine now that @entity61 falls substantially short of the 1144			1
he might have won more votes and delegates than anybody else , but it becomes hard to argue that he is a clear favorite			0
party insiders begin to murmur again about the need to find another candidate			0
in an earlier era of @entity116 politics , that could be done			0
in 1920 , a conclave of @entity5 bosses could bypass stronger candidates to choose sen. @entity120 , a politician whose main claim to fame was that he had kept on good terms with all party factions , and who would go on to win the presidency			0
in 1940 , @entity5 leaders chose a total outsider , @entity129 , a businessman who had not only never been elected to anything , but who had actually been a @entity132 delegate at the @entity134 convention of 1932			1
but now ? who even are the @entity5 leaders -- aside from @entity137 , that is ? the big donors ? but they already chose @entity61 and now find they can not make their choice stick			1
the big change in @entity116 politics over the past two decades has been the decline of followership			0
party members expect the party to serve them -- one major reason that both parties have drifted to the ideological extremes since the 1970s			0
that expectation would only be intensified and concentrated in a party convention with @entity153 and talk radio whipping and riling the delegates into angry emotionalism			1
a decision - making convention in modern times wo n't submit to the edicts of smoke - filled rooms			1
the delegates will want their own way			0
if @entity61 fails to win the primaries over the next few months , brace yourself : not for a replay of 1920 , when @entity5 bosses made their coldly calculated deal , but for a replay of 1896 , when the @entity169 went wild for @entity171 after one thrilling speech			2
of course , @entity171 went on to lose in a landslide			0
follow @entity174 on @entity175 join the conversation on @entity177 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			1

@entity180 : it 's possible no candidate could reach delegate total to claim nomination
he says an open convention would n't follow *historical* pattern
media *spotlight* and *indepedent* - minded delegates could sway the outcome , he says
@entity180 says @entity61 might be forced to take positions *unpopular* in general election
