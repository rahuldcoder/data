@entity0 -- the saga of billionaire @entity3 enters a new phase monday when a @entity6 probate court trial examines his estranged wife 's takeover of the couple 's trust that owns the @entity11 , which she is now trying to sell for a record $ 2 billion			1
it 's been an operatic tale			0
@entity3 slurred african - americans in a taped conversation with a woman acquaintance			2
the @entity17 banned him and ordered the couple to sell the team			1
his wife , @entity20 , negotiated a price that would be unprecedented for a sports franchise in @entity23			0
she did so as doctors certified @entity3 , 80 , as incapacitated with early @entity25 or another brain disease			2
questions persist , however , on whether the team 's planned sale to former @entity31 ceo @entity30 is a done deal , because @entity3 disputes his wife 's authority in the negotiations			1
the couple own the @entity17 franchise through a trust			1
will there be a trial on monday ? it 's anybody 's guess : anything can happen in the @entity45 saga -- and just about has			1
@entity3 now wants to move the controversy over the basketball team 's proposed sale to federal court -- a legal move he made just before friday 's @entity52 holiday			1
it 's unclear whether he 'll be successful -- or what impact the last - minute maneuver will have on monday 's scheduled trial in a state court in @entity0			2
@entity59 's attorney described the move as desperation			0
" @entity3 's 11th - hour attempt to move the probate trial into the federal courts is a desperate act by a desperate man , " said @entity62			1
" this latest bad - faith maneuver on the eve of his reckoning is a cowardly ploy to do just one thing : kill a record - setting $ 2 billion sale of the @entity11 , " @entity62 said			0
but @entity3 's attorney says federal court is the appropriate place to hear how the publicizing of his medical diagnosis " trampled " his privacy rights under the federal @entity80 ( @entity80 ) -- which @entity59 denies , saying the trust allowed for the information 's release			1
" while @entity59 and her team will claim that this is merely a ' tactic , ' we feel strongly that this important issue should be addressed by the federal court at this time , " said lawyer @entity84			1
" while it has become popular to attack @entity3 for his regrettable comments , his right to privacy and to the protection of his medical records should not be acceptable collateral damage			0
" even @entity30 has entered the dispute , with his attorney saying he would file papers to block what he called a frivolous move by @entity3			0
the parties will be monitoring how the state and federal courts will proceed monday			0
will we hear more about @entity3 's mental issues ? no. the trial will focus on @entity59 's right to sell the @entity11 and not @entity3 's mental capacity , attorneys for both sides say			1
testimony will largely focus on how the couple own the team through a trust and whether procedures for removing one of the trust 's owners -- namely @entity3 -- were followed			1
the trial , however , will address an accusation by @entity3 that his wife duped him into undergoing separate examinations by a neurologist and a specialist in geriatric psychiatry , who both judged him to be mentally incapacitated			2
@entity3 also disputes those findings			0
" we are going to argue that their examinations were by way of undue influence , that their examinations were not complete , that there was fraud in the examinations , and the letters that they have issued do not comport with technical requirements that the trust requires , " @entity84 said			0
@entity59 maintains her husband 's arguments about being tricked are baseless , her attorney said			0
" there was no duping or whatever , " @entity62 said			0
" @entity3 voluntarily went to ... get the brain scan			0
" late last month , another doctor found @entity3 to be mentally fit , a source with knowledge of the situation told @entity1			0
so what will the probate trial be all about ? the court will hear five issues , according to court papers filed by @entity59			2
first , the court will determine whether the physicians ' evaluations of @entity3 were obtained by fraud , undue influence or breach of fiduciary duty , as he claims			2
the court will then decide whether @entity59 's may 29 contract to sell the team to @entity30 is binding			2
even if the court does n't affirm that , the judge will weigh whether the contract is nevertheless binding on the couple 's trust because it 's in the trust 's best interest -- in other words , whether it 's too great a deal to pass up			2
the court will then have to examine how @entity3 later revoked the trust in june -- in apparent retaliation for his wife negotiating a proposed deal to sell the team -- and whether his revocation prevents the sale of the team or the court 's jurisdiction over the trust			1
finally , the judge must decide whether to provide relief to prevent injury or loss			0
how did this deal ever get done ? facing pressure from the @entity17 , @entity3 signed a letter in may -- on the same day when one of the physicians examined him -- to the basketball league agreeing to the sale of the @entity11 and authorizing his wife to negotiate the sale of the team			1
but @entity3 changed his mind on the entire controversy : he sued the @entity17 for $ 1 billion for its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise			1
he then opposed the proposed sale of the team negotiated by his wife			0
what 's the rush in all this ? the contract between @entity59 and @entity30 has a july 15 deadline to close the deal -- with a 30 - day extension , if needed			0
at the same time , the @entity45 face a september 15 deadline to sell team , as set by the @entity17			1
if not , the league may sell the franchise on its own or renew termination proceedings against the @entity11 or both , according to @entity17 general counsel @entity221 's statements in @entity59 's court filings			1
@entity3 in @entity1 exclusive : i 'm not a racist , i 'm a giver			0
