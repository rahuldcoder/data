-- @entity1 is a champion of the internet as a catalyst that lets anyone become a publisher or a promoter of worthwhile causes			1
but for his first book -- which happens to be about that very topic -- @entity1 is turning to the traditional publishing channels			1
the book will tentatively be called " without your permission : how the 21st century will be made -- not managed , " said @entity1 , who co-founded website aggregator @entity15 and started his own independent book publisher			1
to develop the book , he and his agent sought the services of @entity21 , an imprint of the @entity21 - owned @entity23			2
" there 's a big value that going through a traditional publisher brings to someone like me , " @entity1 said in a phone interview from @entity25 , @entity26 , where he was speaking at a conference			2
" frankly , i just needed the help			0
" the tiny , charitable publisher that @entity1 runs , called @entity34 , puts out books for popular web comics , such as @entity37 and @entity38			1
because those websites already had fans accustomed to paying for posters , t - shirts and other merchandise , @entity34 did not need to focus on marketing , building online storefronts or dealing with retailers , as most book publishers do			2
after co-founding , leading and now advising @entity15 , which continues to grow as its peers have withered , @entity1 helped launch the fast - growing travel search website @entity50			1
he relinquished his role as head of marketing this summer in order to focus on writing and on his speaking engagements			2
people in the publishing industry began approaching @entity1 in 2009 after he gave a @entity59 talk about an obscure web meme called @entity61			1
the name is taken from a @entity64 mascot that some blogs and @entity15 users helped promote			2
the book will combine advice for building successful startup ventures and marketing secrets with examples of heartwarming stories about using the internet for grass - roots campaigns			1
it will also include doodles , which perhaps should n't be surprising coming from the man who designed the logos for @entity34 , @entity50 and @entity15			1
" without your permission " is expected to be published in early 2013 , according to @entity79 , the publisher and editor - in - chief for @entity21			0
the publishing house has produced best - sellers from @entity0 founder @entity85 , former @entity86 secretary of the treasury @entity87 , and @entity90 founder @entity89			0
@entity1 , at 28 , is the least experienced of the group , despite his major accomplishments since graduating from the @entity93			0
" this guy is a real personality , and he obviously knows the @entity73 , " @entity79 said			0
" there are a lot of books out there about how to become a success on the @entity73			0
most of them do n't sell much			0
" however , @entity1 has @entity79 and his team convinced			0
if the budding author can help rename a serious @entity64 initiative as @entity61 , maybe his viral abilities can sell books , too .			0

@entity15 co-founder @entity1 says he is writing a book
he is leaving his post as head of marketing for travel - search site @entity50
the book will include tips for web *entrepreneurs* and people running viral campaigns
