@entity0 -- @entity3 's drug war in @entity4 is failing badly , according to a new report from a @entity3 government watchdog			1
@entity4 farmers are growing record bumper crops of opium poppies , an unprecedented 209,000 hectares in 2013 , according to a report issued tuesday by the @entity11			1
this despite various @entity3 agencies spending $ 7.6 billion to try to stop narcotics production in @entity4			1
@entity4 is the source of 80 % of the world 's illegal opium , the @entity3 government says , yielding $ 3 billion in sales in 2013 , up from $ 2 billion from the year earlier			1
according to the report , a big chunk of that money funds the insurgency and terrorism			0
" the recent record - high level of poppy cultivation calls into question the long - term effectiveness and sustainability of those prior efforts , " the report by the @entity11 office says			0
" given the severity of the opium problem and its potential to undermine @entity3 objectives in @entity4 , i strongly suggest that your departments consider the trends in opium cultivation and the effectiveness of past counternarcotics efforts when planning future initiatives			2
" the report says the 209,000 hectares record in 2013 , surpasses the previous mark of 193,000 of opium poppy grown in 2007			0
the report relies on figures from the @entity49			0
the inspector general report says that areas that were once models for successful counterinsurgency and counternarcotics efforts are now booming poppy producers			0
the report cites @entity57 in eastern @entity4 , which the @entity58 declared " poppy - free " in 2008 , but saw a fourfold increase in opium poppy production between 2012 - 2013			2
the inspector general sent the report to the @entity65 departments , whose agencies fund various anti-drug efforts in @entity4			2
the @entity68 called the findings " disappointing , " but blamed the increase in opium poppy production on shifts in the @entity4 government 's own security efforts			1
the @entity75 asked the inspector general to remove defense secretary @entity77 from receiving the report because the military plays a secondary role to other @entity3 government agencies in thwarting drug production in @entity4			1
" in our opinion , the failure to reduce poppy cultivation and increase eradication is due to the lack of @entity4 government support for the effort , " @entity83 , assistant secretary of defense wrote to the inspector general			0
" poverty , corruption , the terrorism nexus to the narcotics trade , and access to alternative livelihood opportunities that provide an equal or greater profit than poppy cultivation are all contributors to the @entity4 drug problem			0

the report comes tuesday from the @entity11 .
@entity3 agencies have spent $ 7.6 billion to stop narcotics production in the @entity114 country .
