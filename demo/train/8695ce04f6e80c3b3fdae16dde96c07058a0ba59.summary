-- one of the nightmare scenarios of the 21st century is a " rogue state " or terror group getting its hands on nuclear material that could be sufficiently enriched to make a weapon			1
and diplomatic cables obtained by @entity8 show that from @entity10 to central @entity11 , it 's a constant preoccupation of @entity13 officials			1
two cables from 2007 detailed the discovery of uranium in " multiple containers " in the @entity18			1
" all items have marking and labels indicating that they were produced in @entity21 , " one says			0
the cables , written by the @entity23 in neighboring @entity24 , quote an unnamed informant as saying the uranium was found in a fortified bunker			1
" it took four months to open the bunker			0
in the process of opening the bunker two men were killed by a grenade booby trap			0
there were also land mines planted around it , " one cable says			0
the informant , described by the @entity38 newspaper as a local elder , added : " one container weighing 3 kg is currently located in @entity41 and another 3 kg container is located in @entity43 , " two towns in eastern @entity18			1
and he said he knew of " someone who has 3 containers who would be willing to sell them			0
" regarding the motivation of the man and his associates , the cable quoted them as saying " they did not want these items to fall into the wrong hands , specifically mentioning that they did not want @entity58 to possess the items			0
" and they were reluctant to notify the @entity18 authorities because " they were afraid that the corrupt @entity18 police would steal the items and sell it themselves			1
" for @entity13 diplomats , one of the challenges is to work out what might amount to a real danger , and what might be a scam			1
the @entity18 informants were " anxiously waiting for some sort of indication from us that we are willing to pay for it , " according to the cable			1
" the men did not know if the uranium was weapon - usable fissile material , highly enriched uranium , what the percentage of uranium - 235 isotope or other isotopes were , or how its content was determined			1
" in the end @entity13 diplomats concluded : " this case fits the profile of typical scams involving nuclear smuggling originating from the eastern @entity18			1
" in 2006 , another cable -- from @entity94 in @entity95 -- discussed the possible shipment of @entity98 uranium overseas			1
it says that " according to a senior @entity103 diplomat , the shipment of uranium through @entity94 is common knowledge to two @entity103 shipping companies			1
" the uranium was supposedly from @entity18 and was destined for @entity107 -- though embassy officials pointed out that the reports were unsubstantiated			1
security at nuclear installations has been another cause for alarm			2
in 2006 , @entity13 diplomats toured a non-functioning nuclear research center that included two reactors in the @entity18 capital , @entity117			1
one , according to the director of the center , contained " 5.1 kilograms of enriched uranium , " which is @entity122 , enriched to 20 percent			2
the visitors noted : " external and internal security is poor , leaving the facility vulnerable to theft			0
the fence is not lit at night , has no razor - wire across the top , and is not monitored by video surveillance			0
there is also no cleared buffer zone between it and the surrounding vegetation			0
" as for the guards , " some are elderly , and some are occasionally caught sleeping on the job , " the cable adds			0
" it is relatively easy for someone to break into the nuclear reactor building or the nuclear waste storage building and steal rods or nuclear waste , with no greater tool than a lock cutter			2
" in fact , two fuel rods had vanished from the facility in 1998			0
one was subsequently found when the @entity152 in @entity153 tried to sell it to unidentified buyers from the @entity156			0
the other was never recovered			0
guarding nuclear materials appears to have been a problem in @entity160 , too			2
a cable from the @entity13 embassy there earlier this year noted , " the lone security guard standing watch at @entity160 's main radioactive materials storage facility was removed from his post on december 30 , 2009 , according to ( name redacted )			1
" and it adds , " very little now stands between the bad guys and @entity160 's nuclear material			1
" @entity13 president @entity171 has made it a priority to secure vulnerable nuclear stocks within four years in a global drive to pre-empt nuclear terrorism			1
while some progress has been made , data from the @entity178 show there is plenty of nuclear material on the loose			1
in the year to june 2010 , the @entity178 reported 61 incidents involving theft or loss			0
five of the incidents involved high enriched uranium or plutonium , including one of illegal possession			2
several cables refer to attempts to sell nuclear and radiological materials stolen in the wake of the collapse of the @entity198			1
one of the more bizarre incidents occurred in @entity200 in 2008 , when a man walked into the @entity13 embassy to try to help sell " uranium plates " owned by an unidentified @entity205 general living in @entity200			1
" the material was allegedly stolen from @entity208 , " the cable says			2
" the walk - in stated he is not on any medications and has not consulted any mental health specialists			0
" several incidents are reported in cables from the @entity216 nations -- the most recent so far published referring to an incident last year			2
a car carrying three @entity219 set off a gamma alarm as it crossed into @entity221			0
" the driver of the vehicle said that he had recently had surgery , during which time a radioactive isotope was injected into his body , " an explanation that apparently satisfied the @entity221 border guards			0
but the alarm sounded again when the car crossed the border at a later date and an inspection " determined that the car was contaminated with @entity234 , " a radioactive isotope frequently found in the low - level waste from medical or research labs which in the wrong hands could be an ingredient for a " dirty bomb			0
" however , a search of the vehicle failed to produce any radioactive material and the occupants were allowed to go			2
the @entity234 had apparently been delivered			0
one interesting aspect of that incident was that the alarm was set off by a " radiation detection portal monitor , " hundreds of which have been installed at border crossings in many parts of the @entity251 as part of a program run by the @entity13 @entity254			1
however , the effectiveness of the devices has been questioned			0
one cable on the incident says it " reveals that some training gaps remain within the patrol police on how to appropriately handle alarms			2
" in another case that is not covered by the leaked cables published so far , two @entity219 pleaded guilty last month to smuggling highly enriched uranium into the nation of @entity221 , hiding it in a lead - lined box on a train from the @entity219 capital , @entity268 , to @entity269 in @entity221			2
their illicit cargo was not detected by alarms , but they were eventually caught by a good old - fashioned sting operation			0
the two @entity219 , a physicist and the former owner of a dairy business , are now serving long jail terms in @entity221			0

cables from 2007 describe a @entity18 incident thought to be a scam
