-- " slow and steady wins the race " may be the moral of a children 's tale , but the adage did n't hold up over the weekend in the case of @entity8 the tortoise vs. @entity11 police			1
the 150 - pound tortoise decided to make a break for it in @entity15 , @entity11 , on saturday			1
but he was no match for local police , who found the creature wandering the streets east of @entity21			1
" almost had a pursuit ! " the @entity22 wrote on its @entity24 page			2
" it took two officers to take this guy into custody , " they explained -- because of the creature 's weight			2
@entity34 , they joked , were n't an option			2
in short order , police say , @entity8 was reunited with his family			1
locals chimed in on @entity24 , most celebrating @entity8 's safe return			1
one woman claimed she saw the tortoise while he was on the lam " eating grass and leaves and moving at a fast clip			0
" others made @entity50 jokes			0
but the @entity22 shut those down , writing that @entity8 " did not respond to ' @entity52 , ' ' @entity53 , ' ' @entity54 , ' or ' @entity55			2
' " it 's not the first time the police department has taken a walk on the wild side			0
