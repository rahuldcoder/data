@entity0 -- some elections are fueled by passion			0
others are guided by a sense of urgency			0
this one seems to be driven by ambivalence			0
that is where we 're at as we near tuesday 's @entity13 caucuses , the kickoff to the voting portion of the 2012 election			1
according to the polls in the @entity13 , @entity18 and @entity19 are virtually tied for the lead , each with no more than a quarter of the vote			2
a new @entity1 / @entity25 / @entity24 poll finds that @entity19 has 25 % and @entity18 has 22 % , with @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 each in the teens			0
@entity31 officials would like to convince @entity32 that they have an embarrassment of riches on their hands , but many of us can see that they 're only half right			1
it 's just an embarrassment			0
a big part of the @entity31 ' problem is having a " front - runner " who ca n't seem to get out in front			1
many voters feel as if the choice has already been made for them , and they 're not having any of it			1
on a recent trip to @entity49 , i was reminded again that the @entity51 media and the @entity31 establishment have ordained @entity19 the party 's presidential nominee and all but declared that the voting is just a formality			1
yet , someone forgot to tell the voters , who elevate one candidate after another from the " anybody but @entity19 " pile while keeping the former @entity65 governor trapped under a 25 % ceiling in the polls			0
as recently noted by @entity70 , a recent @entity72 poll of @entity31 put support for @entity19 at 24 % , and last month , his level of support floated between 22 % and 25 %			2
it 's hard to see how @entity19 could cobble together a string of second - place finishes , with a possible win in @entity78 , and wind up as a credible contender for the general election			0
and even if he does somehow wind up being the nominee , it 's even harder to imagine that the more than three - fourths of @entity31 who were thoroughly uninspired by him just a few months earlier would suddenly get excited enough to turn out and vote			1
in fact , even in this late hour , @entity31 thought leaders such as @entity89 , publisher of the @entity90 , are still suggesting that another @entity31 candidate could enter the race			2
that is not likely to happen , but the fact that some people would like it to tells us a lot about a level of dissatisfaction with the current crop of @entity31 prospects			1
the grass is n't any greener for @entity104			0
while they have the advantage of knowing who their nominee will be , they also have to contend with the same difficult task that the @entity31 face : energizing the base to support the candidate			2
many of those who voted for @entity116 in 2008 do n't seem all that eager to give him an encore			1
he lost much of his support from independents early on , but he also has an enthusiasm gap developing with liberals who think the president lacks courage and caves in to republicans too easily			0
according to a new poll by the @entity128 , while most @entity104 want to re-elect @entity116 , one in five of them are n't so sure			1
just 37 % of those surveyed -- republicans , @entity104 and independents --- are certain they want to give @entity116 another term			2
and , despite all the campaigning up to this point , nearly 20 % of voters are still undecided about whom to support			0
to be re-elected , @entity116 needs to recapture the support of two groups of voters : young people and @entity141			1
unfortunately for @entity104 , he 's not doing a good job of inspiring either			0
both groups still support @entity116 , and they certainly prefer him to every possible @entity31 alternative			1
the problem is the same kind of enthusiasm gap that @entity19 is facing with @entity31 voters			1
while 18 - to - 29 year - old @entity32 remain solidly in the @entity104 camp , only 49 % of them approve of @entity116 's job performance , according to a survey by the @entity153			1
that 's a 23 point drop since february 2009			0
something similar is happening with @entity157 voters , many of whom are deeply disillusioned -- even wounded -- by @entity116 's broken promise to fix the immigration system combined with his heavy - handed deportation policies that have resulted in the removal of more than 1.2 million people in less than three years			1
according to a new @entity169 - @entity168 poll , the president 's support among @entity141 continues to plummet			0
in april 2009 , 86 % of @entity141 approved of @entity116 's job performance			2
today , it 's only about 56 %			0
according to an analysis done by @entity169 , that drop suggests that , " the disillusion among @entity141 is more pronounced than among the general public			0
" add all this up , and this could be an election with one of the lowest turnouts in history -- for @entity31 and @entity104			2
voters are sending a message that both parties need to heed : " do n't just tell me i need to vote for your candidate			1
give me something worth voting for			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190			2

@entity190 : we 're about to see the start of the voting for @entity195
he says voters in both parties are ambivalent about the choices
@entity31 ca n't seem to crown a front - runner ; liberals *lukewarm* on @entity116 , he says
@entity190 : many people may choose not to vote , unless candidates rise to the *occasion*
