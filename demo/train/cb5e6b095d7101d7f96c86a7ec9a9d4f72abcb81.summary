-- there has been momentous change in @entity4 's attitude around gay rights			1
in 2012 , a @entity7 poll showed that 59 % of @entity4 adults said gay and lesbian relationships are morally acceptable , up 19 percentage points since 2001			0
polls show that a majority in the country support same - sex marriage			1
the gay marriage question has even reached halls of the @entity17 which , today , struck down a key provision of the @entity19 , and @entity21 's @entity20 8 , a voter - approved ballot that banned same - sex marriage			1
there has been much written in the press about how gays have gone from a reviled minority to accepted in just a matter of decades			0
but it is important to remember that this is not some magical shift that happened because we watched lovable gay characters on " @entity32 " and " @entity33			0
" it is due in part to real people led by youth , who came out of the shadows to work to change attitudes within their own communities , neighborhoods , workplaces and places of worship			2
over the past three years , i 've filmed @entity46 , which examines how the black community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the marriage movement and the fight over civil rights			1
the film is centered in @entity54 , which has a significant black voting bloc , during the 2012 election			0
it documents the activists working to build support for a referendum supporting marriage equality			0
it features young people like @entity64 , who spent the past three years working to build support for marriage equality in black churches and communities			0
i followed her in the streets of @entity71 and the leafy suburbs of @entity73 as she engaged with people from all walks of life about how the push for gay equality was an expansion of civil rights			2
she questioned how black people , given their struggle to be granted freedoms , could be against granting rights to someone else			0
what i saw in @entity54 was that the activists who were working for marriage equality were untangling the layers of the issue , and they were engaging african - americans in a way that had not happened before			2
and it was youth -- the " @entity46 " in the film -- who pushed their parents , their teachers and some of their clergy to understand gay rights as an expansion of civil rights			1
these conversations helped lead to a very different outcome in @entity54 in 2012 than in @entity21 in 2008 : for the first time , the public voted for marriage equality			0
these discussions were happening in different homes around @entity4			0
even president @entity110 cited his daughters , @entity112 and @entity113 , in his evolution from supporting civil unions to supporting same - sex marriage			1
it feels like their efforts have now allowed this new understanding about who gets civil rights , and also the perception of gay @entity4			1
and even as there are still more battles to fight -- to stop hate crimes , allow for adoption laws and end workplace discrimination -- it is significant that the gay community is seen less as a deviant group asking for special rights and more as humans entitled to civil rights , fairness and equality to all			1
