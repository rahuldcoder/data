-- in the scorching desert of @entity3 , scientists are showing that saltwater can be used to help grow crops			1
a one hectare research initiative known as the @entity7 -- modest in size , but not in ambition -- has produced a harvest of barley , cucumbers and arugula in the last few months using a mix of ingredients not usually associated with successful agriculture : seawater and @entity3 's ample supply of heat			1
conceived in @entity20 , the first - ever @entity7 facility launched last november to coincide with the @entity22 climate conference e ( @entity22 ) in @entity23			1
it implements a range of cutting - edge environmentally - friendly technologies that takes the things that @entity3 has in excess -- heat and seawater -- and converts them into a range of valuable resources			1
" these are ideas that could sound too good to be true , " admits the project ceo , @entity7 , adding that in the early days the project met with an equal measure of enthusiasm and skepticism			1
" really , though , there 's a very simple principle behind this			0
our starting point was to take what we have enough of -- seawater , heat -- and use it to produce what we need more of -- water , energy and a sustainable production of food			1
" the project has a global scope			2
it boasts seawater - cooled greenhouses , concentrated solar power and algae production -- all working symbiotically to solve several of the world 's ecological crises in one go			1

" the high temperatures and humidity make it very challenging for our technology			0
but if the technology works there , and it has , it proves it 's feasible for many locations around the world			0
" in addition to producing food and desalinated water in regions that indigenously lack both , the facility is also looking into greening the desert and creating alternative , eco-friendly fuel sources			1
@entity89 is one of the cornerstones of the project ; it 's what allows it to address so many issues at once , like an elaborate , environmental @entity96 mechanism			2
the facility features a concentrated solar power plant , which turns heat into steam , then , with turbines and generators , into electricity , which in turn pumps seawater to the site , where it is used to cool the greenhouses			1
freshwater waste from the greenhouses is then used to irrigate plants outside			0
strategically planted hedges outside the greenhouse help filter the remainder , creating a humidified and cooler environment for plants downwind			0

algae production on its own , says @entity63 , can be expensive and dependent on geographical constraints ( it usually needs to be developed along expensive , sought - after coastal property )			1
" what we 're doing is putting an algae cultivation system into an even broader system that can share costs and increase energy			2
one of the biggest shared costs we have is the saltwater infrastructure , " she says			0
@entity134 , the chair and ceo of @entity136 , an ngo that promotes green energy , says the project is , potentially , a " game changer "			2
" the biggest issues right now are climate change and water resources globally , and these simple technologies can tackle both , " he says			2
" i ca n't help thinking that this is vision , not mirage			0
" read more : risks and rewards in @entity149 city project some experts , however , question if the @entity7 is the best use of resources			1
the facility , which was funded by fertilizer companies @entity155 and @entity156 and cost $ 5.3 million to set up			0
" with the same funding , you could restore ecosystems and help people more effectively through community - based natural resource management , " says @entity157 , a forest ecologist who has conducted research in the @entity160 region of @entity161 with the @entity162			0
" rather than pouring water on desert sands that have n't had much vegetation in centuries , you can restore land that until recently had a healthy tree cover			2
natural regeneration of trees in the @entity160 is less flashy and more difficult , but you could directly benefit the families that depend on the trees , " he adds			0
despite the mixed reviews , @entity180 says that the site has proven itself with the new crop influx , adding that many skeptics have been won over			0
" it helps when people can see it on the ground , and taste the cucumbers and see that this is real , " he says			0
" we 've proven that this can be implemented			0

@entity7 in @entity3 implements a range of cutting - edge green technologies that all work together
the system includes seawater greenhouses , concentrated solar power and algae production
the goal is to produce food and other vegetation , as well as desalinated water
the project has *elicited* enthusiasm but also skepticism over whether it is a good use of resources
