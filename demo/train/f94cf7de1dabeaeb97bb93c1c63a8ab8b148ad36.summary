@entity0 -- president @entity2 released his long - awaited debt reduction plan monday , outlining a roughly $ 3 trillion savings blueprint that was immediately criticized by top congressional and other @entity5			1
the president 's plan includes $ 1.5 trillion in new revenue generated largely by higher taxes on the wealthiest @entity11 , a proposal strongly opposed by @entity14 leaders who insist that any tax increase will undermine an already shaky economy			1
the measure -- which would add to nearly $ 1 trillion in savings signed into law under the debt - ceiling deal enacted in august -- does not include changes to @entity22			1
it would increase @entity25 premiums for individuals with higher incomes starting in 2017 -- the year @entity2 leaves office if he wins a second term			2
" we are not going to have a one - sided deal that hurts the folks that are most vulnerable , " @entity2 said at the @entity30 , offering a defense of tax hikes on the highest earners			1
spending cuts alone " will not solve our fiscal problems			0
we ca n't just cut our way out of this hole , " he added			0
" it 's going to take a balanced approach			0
if we 're going to make spending cuts -- many of which we would n't make if we were n't facing such large budget deficits -- then it 's only right that we ask everyone to pay their fair share			0
" @entity2 explicitly promised to veto any debt - reduction legislation that cuts benefits while failing to include higher taxes on the wealthy			1
@entity53 : what do you think about @entity2 's plan ? " i will not support any plan that puts all the burden on ordinary @entity11 , " he insisted			1
republicans responded by dismissing the plan as little more than a cheap political gimmick			2
it 's " a thinly veiled attempt to score political points , " said @entity65 chairman @entity64			0
" by raising taxes on job creators , @entity2 may win back some support from disgruntled liberal voters , but @entity11 will lose even more sorely needed jobs			1
" " veto threats , a massive tax hike , phantom savings and punting on entitlement reform is not a recipe for economic or job growth â € ” or even meaningful deficit reduction , " said @entity72 minority leader @entity71 , @entity73			2
" pitting one group of @entity11 against another is not leadership , " added house speaker @entity81 , @entity82			0
key congressional democrats quickly rallied to @entity2 's defense , calling the blueprint a serious attempt to take on one of the most contentious issues in @entity0			2
the " proposal is clearly moving in the right direction , " said @entity93 sen. @entity92 , chairman of the @entity94			0
" it represents a significant and balanced plan for bringing our deficits and debt under control			2
" on monday night , @entity2 referred to the @entity65 response as predictable and said the issue shows the fundamental difference between the parties on how the nation should deal with mounting federal deficits and national debt			2
" what has been clear over the last two and a half years is that we have not had a willing partner , " @entity2 told a @entity111 fundraising event			2
" now , we 've been able to get some stuff done despite that , and despite a filibuster in the @entity72			0
but at least over the last nine months what we 've seen is some irreconcilable differences , let 's put it that way			1
" the release of @entity2 's blueprint is likely to set the stage for a fall dominated by harsh partisan debates over taxes and spending , as well as a 2012 presidential campaign focused on growing economic fears			1
under @entity2 's plan , $ 800 billion in revenue would be generated by allowing some of the @entity134 - era tax cuts for high - income households to expire , as the president has repeatedly called for			1
an additional $ 400 billion would result from capping the value of itemized deductions and other exemptions for high - income households			2
read the @entity30 plan ( @entity142 ) the remaining $ 300 billion would come from closing various tax loopholes , according to a senior administration official			1
a new tax surcharge could also be imposed on millionaires : the " @entity147 , " named after investor @entity148 , who argues that the richest @entity11 are not taxed enough			1
wealthier @entity11 often derive much of their income from investments , which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income such as wages			0
as a result , they can end up owing a lower percentage of their income in federal taxes than someone who makes less money , especially once payroll taxes are factored in			2
the concept behind the @entity147 is that those earning more than $ 1 million should not be allowed to pay a lesser percentage of their income in federal taxes than @entity11 lower down the income scale			1
read more : on taxes and debt , left and right dare to agree in terms of spending , @entity2 's plan incorporates $ 580 billion in mandatory cuts , including $ 248 billion from the politically popular @entity25 program			1
roughly 90 % of those savings will come from reducing overpayments in the system , according to a senior administration official			2
any changes to @entity25 benefits wo n't kick in before 2017 , the official said			0
an additional $ 72 billion will come from @entity182 and other health programs			0
the president 's plan does not include any social security reform proposals or changes to the @entity25 eligibility age , reforms that have reportedly been put on the table by the administration in the past but are strongly opposed by a number of progressive @entity193			0
another $ 1.1 trillion in savings would be generated by winding down the wars in @entity196 and @entity197			1
in addition , the administration is counting savings that would result from spending caps it has proposed on future overseas contingency operations			0
the administration also estimates interest savings of approximately $ 430 billion , a result of less borrowing and smaller annual budget shortfalls			2
roughly $ 450 billion in the plan would be used to pay for the @entity209 , the economic stimulus measure proposed by @entity2 last week			1
@entity5 call the president 's plan a form of class warfare			1
" when you pick one area of the economy and you say , ' we 're going to tax those people because most people are not those people , ' that 's class warfare , " sen. @entity214 , @entity73 - @entity215 , said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity216			1
" " we have a difference of opinion on how best to fix these problems , " @entity226 chairman @entity225 , @entity227 , told " @entity231			0
" " but when the president does things like this , it leads you to believe that he 's not in bipartisan consensus - making mood			0
he 's in a political class - warfare mode and campaign mode			2
and that 's not good for our economy			0
" @entity2 explicitly rejected the class warfare claim monday			1
" i reject the idea that asking a hedge fund manager to pay the same tax rate as a plumber or a teacher is class warfare , " the president said			1
" i think it 's just the right the thing to do			0
i believe the @entity11 middle class , who 've been pressured relentlessly for decades , believe it 's time that they were fought for as hard as the lobbyists and some lawmakers have fought to protect special treatment for billionaires and big corporations			0
" @entity193 have blamed republicans for blocking the @entity2 administration 's initiatives purely for what @entity193 insist are short - term political gain			1
" i do n't think people like that style of politics , and that 's the reality ... we 'll be facing in november 2012 , " sen. @entity268 , @entity269 , said sunday			0
@entity276 action on deficit reduction is moving on multiple tracks now			0
@entity268 said the @entity193 - controlled @entity72 would take up @entity2 's jobs plan next month , while leaders in the @entity65 - controlled @entity30 have rejected some parts of it			1
meanwhile , a special deficit reduction commission created under last month 's debt - ceiling agreement has started its work amid the longstanding political divisions on key issues			0
the 12 - member committee , evenly divided between @entity193 and @entity5 in the @entity30 and @entity72 , has until november 23 to draft a $ 1.5 trillion deficit - reduction plan that can win congressional approval by december 23			1
otherwise , more than $ 1 trillion in across - the - board spending cuts will go into effect , on top of $ 900 billion in cuts already mandated under the debt ceiling deal			1
the special committee " is taking this issue far more seriously than the @entity30 , " @entity297 said monday			0
more than a year of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction has failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between @entity5 and @entity193 involving the size of government and whether to raise tax revenue while cutting spending			0
the brinkmanship of the negotiations , with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal was reached , was one reason that ratings agency @entity312 's downgraded the @entity11 credit rating from @entity314 to aa - plus in august			0
@entity1 's @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 contributed to this report .			0
