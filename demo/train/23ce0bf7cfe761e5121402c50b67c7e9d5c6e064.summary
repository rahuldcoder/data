this is the image that struck me more than any other watching the completed " @entity3 : an @entity6 " documentary for the first time			0
a group of women in @entity9 huddled around a television screen watching and recording the moment that history was made -- and barriers were broken -- blazing a trail for future generations of women in their country			2
@entity18 becoming the first @entity9 woman to represent their flag on the track at the @entity23			1
never before had these women been able to watch one of their own running and representing like that on an international stage			2
it was unique , and unprecedented			2
and for me , it sums up @entity23 and women 's sport			1
those three weeks of the @entity23 were undoubtedly like no other in my career as a sports journalist			1
never before had we seen so much coverage of women 's sports			1
it was n't just the number of women we were talking about , but also the way in which we were talking about them			2
from @entity18 to her fellow @entity9 trailblazer @entity45 , to @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , there were women making the headlines everywhere you looked			0
we were discussing the battles , their performance , power and skills -- not just their hairstyles and love of shoes			1
it made it virtually impossible to rationalize the now infamous words of the founder of the modern @entity67 movement -- @entity68 -- from 1896 : " olympics with women would be incorrect , unpractical , uninteresting , and unaesthetic			0
" i 'm pleased to say we really do seem to have moved on from the view of women 's sport as incorrect , unpractical and unaesthetic			1
@entity9 was the last stronghold of that			0
but worryingly , now the excitement of the @entity23 has died down , " uninteresting " seems to have returned to the psyche			1
twelve months on from " the @entity77 " where has all the coverage gone ? i carried out a quick survey on friday august 2 : admittedly it was pretty unscientific , but of 56 pages of sports coverage in six daily national newspapers from the @entity85 and @entity86 there were only five -- yes , five -- stories about women 's sport			1
that 's five out of 122 stories , and that would be classed as a good day			0
the ones there were covered @entity95 golfer @entity94 going for her fourth straight professional major in a calendar year , a feat that 's never been accomplished in the women 's game			1
it would have been a quite incredible achievement			0
can you imagine the excitement if it had been @entity105 or @entity106 on the verge of such an incredible quadruple ? the other stories were about @entity110 pulling out of the @entity111			0
or in other words , the reigning @entity67 heptathlon champion pulling out of her sport 's second biggest event			2
compare that to the coverage @entity118 got when it was announced he would n't be defending his @entity121 crown in 2013			0
hands up ( honestly ) if you knew it was n't in fact @entity94 that won the women 's @entity126 but @entity86 's @entity128			1
how much coverage in newspapers , or in tv news bulletins , was given to the phenomenal achievement of @entity134 's women 's football team winning its sixth straight @entity135 ? or @entity136 winning a record sixth gold medal at the world swimming championships ? these women at the top of their game are done a disservice by the media			1
why should men 's sport be seen as more worthy of coverage than women 's events ? why should we have to search these stories out online ? there 's no less competition , skill or sacrifice in what they achieve			1
just like the @entity159 's fight to get @entity9 to send female athletes to the @entity23 , it was n't easy for those women to watch @entity18 's historic moment			1
such was the opposition to allowing women to compete , domestic television stations and newspapers chose to ignore it altogether and instead focused their attention on the bronze medal - winning men 's equestrian team			2
but the race was shown on a number of satellite channels and word did get out there			0
the @entity23 has begun a process in @entity9 that looks set to dramatically change the lives of women in the country			1
having previously been banned , sports classes are now allowed in girls ' schools -- and the country 's first sports club for women opened in june , with training programs including physical fitness , karate and yoga			2
whether we like it or not , the way media covers -- or does n't cover -- people and events goes a long way to shaping attitudes			0
look at what 's trendy or in fashion or who 's beautiful			0
if the media tell us it often enough , then people start to believe it			0
@entity18 is being held up by many as an example to young girls in @entity9			0
a trailblazer to inspire not just a generation but a whole shift in society			0
maybe a few more of us need to take note .			0

@entity215 's @entity214 heralds impact @entity23 had on women 's sport
coverage of female sport was unprecedented for two weeks of the @entity77
@entity223 was on ability , power and performances and not on hair or shoes
but 12 months on where has all the coverage of women 's sport gone ?
