-- as a young boy , i loved watching the @entity3			0
i can recall countless historic moments over the course of their 47 - year history in the city			0
it was in @entity10 that the @entity3 won an unprecedented 14 division championships from 1991 to 2005			2
it was in @entity10 that hall of famer @entity13 hit his record - breaking home run in 1974			0
it was in @entity10 that the @entity3 won a @entity18 championship in 1995			2
there is no doubt that the @entity3 belong to @entity10			2
for 18 months , my administration has been involved in good - faith discussions to keep the @entity3 in downtown @entity10 as their lease at @entity24 nears expiration			1
on monday , the @entity3 organization announced its intention to relocate to @entity28 -- in a new stadium			1
our partners in @entity28 will provide $ 450 million in public funding to build the new $ 672 million stadium , we 're told			2
we are simply unwilling to match that with taxpayer dollars			0
on my inauguration into office in january 2010 , i made a promise to strengthen our city 's finances and tackle our looming $ 922 million infrastructure backlog			1
over the last four years , we have balanced four consecutive budgets without property tax increases , built our cash reserves to more than $ 125 million and improved our bond ratings across the spectrum in every fund			0
@entity47 too steep to keep @entity3 in city limits over the next four years , i am committed to making $ 200 million to $ 250 million in infrastructure investments in our neighborhoods			1
professional sports teams and stadiums drive economic development and investment in their communities , but taxpayer dollars need to be spent responsibly			0
my decision not to invest $ 150 million to $ 250 million for renovations to @entity24 or interfere with a transaction when the @entity3 are moving 12 miles away means that @entity10 is going to be stronger financially and not choked by debt			1
this decision also means critical investments in our city 's infrastructure -- on bridges , green spaces , roads and traffic lights			0
for many years , the @entity71 and the @entity3 have been fixtures in our city 's downtown			1
there will be a new stadium for the @entity71 -- but there are meaningful differences between our efforts to keep the @entity71 in the city and the @entity3 ' decision to relocate to @entity28			1
the agreement to keep the @entity71 involved an existing revenue stream from a hotel - motel tax paid largely by the 42 million guests who visit our city every year -- lessening the burden to taxpayers			1
the hotel - motel tax , which would be extended only to fund and maintain the @entity71 stadium , also generates significant direct revenue to the city 's general fund			1
in the case of the @entity3 , no identifiable revenue stream exists that would allow us to pay for a commitment of $ 450 million or even $ 250 million responsibly			1
the @entity71 stadium is expected to cost $ 1 billion , and that kind of transaction is tough			1
but we negotiated a favorable agreement for the city with 80 % private funding and 20 % public funding for the new facility			0
so we wish the @entity3 well knowing the city of @entity10 has much to be proud of			2
over the last four years , business relocations have included the @entity110 's decision to move 2,000 jobs back into the city , @entity107 moving its @entity114 headquarters into the city , and @entity116 relocating its corporate headquarters to @entity10 from @entity118			2
the city of @entity10 is vibrant and thriving , and we 're just getting started			0
when the @entity3 leave the city of @entity10 in 2017 , @entity24 will be demolished			1
over the next three years , we will be working with our prospective partners to bring residential and business development that is worthy of our city and strengthens our downtown			0
the @entity3 will remain in the @entity10 metropolitan region , and i look forward to going to the opening day game in 2017			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity128 .			0

@entity10 was *hoping* to keep the @entity3 downtown as @entity24 lease nears expiration
@entity128 : but @entity28 made an offer @entity3 could *n't* *refuse*
@entity128 : @entity24 needs up to $ 250 million in repairs ; money could go to city infrastructure
@entity128 : @entity10 is backing a new @entity71 stadium , but it 's getting funded largely by hotel tax
