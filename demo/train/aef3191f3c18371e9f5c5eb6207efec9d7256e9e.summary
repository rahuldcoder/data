@entity0 -- authorities in @entity3 on friday identified the man whose severed head , hands and feet were discovered this week as 66 - year - old @entity7			1
the victim was from @entity0 , said lt. @entity9 with the @entity11 coroner 's office			1
earlier in the day , @entity0 police completed their biggest search in recent memory , with 120 investigators scouring seven acres in the @entity17 hills looking for more body parts			1
but the search , which began tuesday , did n't find additional limbs or a torso , and detectives were continuing their investigation , police said			1
upon concluding the hillside search , police friday reopened @entity25 beneath the @entity17 sign and urged hikers and other recreational visitors to be careful and not walk the trails alone			1
the body parts happened to be located near the home of actor @entity32 , and authorities interviewed his bodyguard for possible leads , police said thursday			1
" it 's standard procedure for us to have our detectives canvass the neighborhood , " @entity36			0
the bodyguard saw nothing unusual , he added			0
meanwhile , the dog walker whose golden retriever , @entity46 , discovered the head in a park tuesday below the @entity17 sign said she at first thought the head was a movie prop			1
" our assumption was that there was always people filming up there , and it was a prop , " @entity53 , who was walking with her mother at the time , told @entity56			1
" we walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head			2
" authorities believe the dismemberment occurred in a place other than the park , @entity9 said			2
officers , coroner 's investigators , helicopters , all - terrain vehicles , a swat team trained in climbing skills and mounted officers searched the section of @entity25 , next to @entity78 , @entity9 said			2
the coroner 's cadaver dog located the two hands and two feet scattered across the brushy and steep terrain , police said			1
authorities believe the human remains were placed in one spot and then were spread by wild animals , @entity9 said			0
the body parts were hidden until the animals found them			1
" you could say it was a determined effort to hide them , " @entity9 said of the body parts , declining to elaborate			1
a search on wednesday located first one hand , about 50 yards from where the head was found			1
another hand and then two feet were found just before waning daylight forced an end to that day 's search , police said			1
the real - life @entity17 mystery began tuesday afternoon as @entity53 and her mother were walking dogs in the park below the @entity17 sign			1
in the interview with @entity56 , @entity53 said she was walking eight dogs when one of them , the golden retriever named @entity46 , ran away from her			0
@entity53 was joined by her mother , who was walking her own dog			2
" we were wandering the trail and the dogs are sniffing around , and he ( @entity46 ) pulled away from me and made a beeline for some brush			0
he was barking , " @entity53 said			0
" a few minutes later , he had something in his mouth , which he immediately dropped , " @entity53 said			0
the object rolled down the ravine , @entity53 said			0
@entity53 and her mother discovered it was a human head belonging to what she described as a white man			2
" we were pretty much gasping , saying , ' oh , my @entity129 ! ' i was shaking			0
it felt like a script , " @entity53 said			0
" it still does n't feel real			0
" the secluded trails , adjacent to @entity78 , are a favorite place for residents , including many celebrities , to walk their dogs or hike			0
the coroner 's office is examining whether the man was dead when the dismemberment occurred , and what kind of instrument may have been used to remove the head and limbs , @entity9 said			2
police do n't have a theory on what happened			2
" right now , we 're keeping an open mind ... on why this poor person was dismembered and deposited up there , " @entity9 said			0
detectives estimated the man had been dead since sunday			0
@entity1 's @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity56 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
