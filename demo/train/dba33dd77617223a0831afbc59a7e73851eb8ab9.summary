-- a major clean - up operation is underway along the north coast of @entity5 's @entity4 as debris and oil leaking from a cargo ship that ran aground on a reef wash ashore , officials say			1
the @entity10 , a @entity12 - flagged vessel , struck the @entity13 , about 12 nautical miles off the city of @entity15 , last week			1
@entity5 's oil spill response agency , @entity17 ( @entity18 ) , estimates that as much as 300 tonnes of fuel oil has leaked from the vessel , which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters ( 450,000 gallons ) of fuel			1
the country 's environment minister , @entity22 , has called the spill @entity5 's most significant maritime environmental disaster			1
as of friday , clean - up teams collected 95.45 tonnes of solid waste and 6 tonnes of liquid waste from beaches in the @entity30 , @entity18 said			0
about 60 kilometers of coastline , from the towns of @entity34 to @entity35 , is contaminated with oil , the agency said			1
pubic access to some waterfront areas has been restricted due to health concerns			0
" we are now coordinating a team of around 1,000 people involved in operations on land , sea and air and covering areas like field operations , planning , logistics , wildlife recovery and community and iwi [ indigenous @entity57 people ] liaison , " said @entity41 commander @entity40			0
@entity18 said that 500 dead birds have been found following the oil spill			1
the agency said 140 people scoured the coast yesterday for wildlife affected by the spill and 51 oiled animals are being treated at a center that has been set up in @entity15			1
a team has been established to capture seals and five of the animals are being kept in captivity			2

" this is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea , " the organization 's @entity78 said			2

salvage teams have three tugs mobilized either to hold the stern on the reef while efforts continue to remove oil from the ship , or to tow the stern to shallow water to extract the oil , the agency said			1
containers remaining on the vessel continue to move , making it dangerous for salvage crews to work on board			0
salvors have worked to build a platform to attach to the side of the vessel today to be used to assist fuel recovery operations , @entity18 said			0
