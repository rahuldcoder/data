-- @entity1 did n't belong to any particular clique in the schools he attended			1
those who knew him described him as quiet , someone who was guarded and rarely spoke about his tumultuous family life			1
but they never would have thought that he 'd turn out a killer -- walking up to a table in the cafeteria of @entity15 's @entity14 with a .22 - caliber gun and pumping 10 rounds at students he picked randomly			2
three students -- @entity21 , 16 ; @entity22 , 16 ; and @entity23 , 17 -- died			2
that was on february 27 , 2012 , when he was a 17 - year - old sophomore			2
@entity26 admitted his crime , did n't offer a reason , and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences at the @entity30 in @entity31			1
three life sentences with no possibility of parole			1
on friday , he was back in the news after he escaped from the facility , triggering an intense manhunt			2
he was captured about six hours later , enough time for him to reopen the wounds that his victims ' families are trying to salve			2
" there has certainly been an undeniable , profound and deep impact on our community , " @entity42 , @entity43 school superintendent , said early friday morning			2
schools will remain closed but counselors and other support services will be provided			2
at school @entity53 's niece rode the school bus each day with @entity26 , and he displayed no warning signs of the violence to come			1
" he was a really nice kid to her , " @entity53 told @entity0 after the shooting in 2012			2
" he would n't start up a conversation , but if she talked to him , he would hold the conversation with her			1
she said her niece noted no personality changes in @entity1 in the weeks leading up to monday 's shooting			0

" @entity26 may have been dealing with his own family problems , according to reports by @entity112 newspaper in @entity89			1

he rarely opened up about his family , some said			0
" i 've asked him once or twice , but he never would go into detail			0
he just said he had family trouble , " @entity64 said online posts on @entity26 's facebook page show him sharing links to music videos			1
yet one long , poetic rant , from december 30 , 2011 , appears to be darker			0
the post refers to " a quaint lonely town , ( where there ) sits a man with a frown ( who ) longed for only one thing , the world to bow at his feet			0
" " he was better than the rest , all those ones he detests , within their castles , so vain , " he wrote			0
@entity26 then writes about going through " the castle ... like an ominous breeze through the trees , " past guards -- all leading up to the post 's dramatic conclusion			1
" feel death , not just mocking you			0
not just stalking you but inside of you , " he writes			0
feel smaller beneath my might			0
seizure in the @entity169 that is my scythe			0
die , all of you			0

he had on a similar shirt during his shooting rampage			0
before the sentencing , he addressed the victims ' families using profane imagery and ending with the expletive , " f --- all of you			2
" he then held up his middle finger			0
" for everyone in that courtroom -- the victims , their families , the prosecutors , defense -- everyone in that courtroom was just absolutely taken aback , " said @entity190 , who represented him at his trial , said late thursday			0
@entity190 , has n't talked to @entity26 in about a year			1
at the proceeding , prosecutor @entity199 said @entity26 never said why he carried out the attack			1
