-- four months after he was escorted in his pajamas onto a military plane and flown out of the country , ousted @entity7 president @entity6 could return to power within days , analysts said friday			1
negotiators for @entity6 and @entity10 , the politician who was appointed president hours after @entity6 's june 28 removal , reached an agreement late thursday to form a government of national reconciliation			1
the nation 's congress , in consultation with the supreme court , must approve @entity6 's return to power			1
the reconciliation government would rule until a new president , to be chosen in november 29 elections , takes office in january			1
@entity10 announced the agreement in a televised speech to the nation thursday night			1
@entity6 said friday his return to the presidency is " imminent " and should occur within days			1
he has been staying at the @entity33 embassy in @entity34 , the @entity7 capital , since secretly returning to the country september 21			2
" at this moment we are trying to reach a consensus so we can reconstruct democracy , " he told @entity36 on friday			2
although @entity6 's return to the presidency is not guaranteed in the eight - point pact , several analysts say they expect the congress will approve the measure			1
" if @entity10 came forward with a public announcement , the odds of this being approved by congress are pretty good			1
it 's a done deal , " said @entity50 , a senior foreign policy fellow at the non-partisan @entity51 and a former vice president of @entity53			1
" it would be a horrible letdown if congress did not approve the agreement			0
" @entity59 , president of the @entity61 policy institute , also believes " they 'll go ahead and vote for it			2
" said @entity64 , director of the liberal @entity65 : " there seems to be no other way			0
" the @entity68 played a key role in the accord after weeks of stalemate			0
@entity72 , assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs , and two other high - level @entity68 officials arrived wednesday and met separately with @entity6 and @entity10			1
an agreement appeared possible thursday when @entity72 announced at a news conference that the @entity68 delegation would stay another day			0
a delegation from the @entity78 had visited @entity7 in early october but failed to obtain an agreement			0
@entity53 president @entity80 had held consultations with both sides but did not get them to agree on a solution			1
the @entity78 , the @entity85 , the @entity86 and the @entity68 condemned the military - backed coup and demanded that @entity6 be reinstated			1
the @entity68 and others imposed economic sanctions , which some analysts say have started to hurt @entity7			0
" the dark secret here is that the @entity7 economy has been devastated , " @entity64 said			0
" huge numbers of @entity7 have crossed over into @entity95 and are desperate for jobs			0
" crumbling economic conditions left @entity10 little choice , @entity64 said			1
" all along @entity10 was holding a diminishing deck , " he said			1
" not only the poor were being hurt			0
the cutoffs were hurting the nation 's economic elite			2
so there was a very strong economic motive to reach a solution			0
" there also was a strong political motive , @entity59 said			0
" the candidates for president , the people looking forward , wanted to see the elections on november 29 as being legitimate , " he said			0
@entity64 agreed that " the candidates wanted a resolution because of legitimacy			0
" the @entity68 and many other nations had said the elections would be considered illegitimate if held under @entity10 's rule			1
" by far , the most important thing right now is not whether @entity6 will be reinstated , but that the @entity68 is going to recognize the elections , " said @entity117 , a @entity118 analyst with the @entity120 consulting firm			1
" the next president will be able to receive diplomatic recognition and much - needed access to international aid and financing , which will be crucial given the weakness of the economy and the fact that the government is running out of money , " she said			2
@entity6 also appeared to have little choice but to accept the pact , even though it does not automatically return to him to power , as he had demanded all along			2
" he did n't have many options , did he ? " said @entity50 of the @entity51			0
" he was never able to mobilize people in the numbers he claimed to have			0
he did n't have much clout , frankly			0
holed up in the @entity33 embassy he became much more marginalized			0
that 's as good as it gets for him			0
" the president 's four - year term -- whether it 's @entity6 or @entity10 -- ends january 27 , when the new head of state will take over			1
@entity117 believes @entity6 heard the clock ticking			2
" @entity6 probably accepted this agreement because he was running out of time and leverage , and he may have thought that going through congress was his best bet at getting an agreement in his favor , " she said			2
@entity64 sees it as a face - saving move			0
" the only thing @entity6 gets out of this is the dignity of serving out his complete term , " @entity64 said			1
" he will be a president without any authority			0
basically , he 's been rendered into a figurehead president			2
" in addition to the formation of a reconciliation government , the pact also stipulates -- at @entity6 's insistence -- that there will be no amnesty for those involved in his ouster			1
@entity10 said in an interview friday evening with @entity36 that he 's certain @entity6 will try to prosecute him			1
just a few weeks ago , it was @entity10 who was saying @entity6 would be prosecuted if he left the @entity33 embassy			1
" yes , we are certain that there will be persecution , " @entity10 said friday			2
" but i am not afraid			0
what we did was within the constitution			0
" @entity10 has insisted @entity6 was removed through constitutional means , not a coup			1
some analysts say legal proceedings might not be the best course			0
" any attempt to seek revenge here is going to be costly and inefficient and conflictive , " said @entity64 , head of the @entity65			0
the pact also calls for the creation of a " truth commission " to investigate the events surrounding @entity6 's ouster ; the formation of a " verification commission " to ensure that the agreement is adhered to ; and a solicitation to the international community to lift economic and diplomatic sanctions			1
the political crisis stemmed from @entity6 's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president			1
the country 's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal			2
@entity6 has said since his ouster he would not try to revive the issue if returned to power			2
that 's a good thing , @entity59 said			0
" the most important thing , " he said , " are the assurances that @entity6 will be limited in his powers			2

negotiators for president @entity6 and de facto president @entity10 reach deal
two sides to form a government of national reconciliation that could reinstate @entity6
@entity6 forced out of country in june 28 coup , *replaced* by *legislative* *leader* @entity10
crisis stems from @entity6 's referendum plan that may have given president longer term
