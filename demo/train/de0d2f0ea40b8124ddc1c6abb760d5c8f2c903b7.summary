nearly two years after tech blogs screamed " @entity5 ! " over problems with the @entity4 's reception , owners will be getting a little pocket change for their troubles			1
@entity8 over the weekend settled a class - action lawsuit filed about the issue , promising to pay $ 15 or give a free case to everyone in the @entity13 who bought one of the wildly popular phones			1
released in june 2010 , the slimmer reworking of @entity8 's smartphone became a huge seller			2
but soon after it went on sale , some owners began complaining that their phone frequently dropped voice calls			0
the culprit , it was ultimately determined , was the antenna , which is wrapped in a band around the phone 's edge to help create its slim form			0
using what became known as the " death grip , " ( i.e. holding the phone at a certain spot ) caused reception to suffer or cut out entirely			0
" this settlement relates to a small number of customers who indicated that they experienced antenna or reception issues with their @entity4 , and did n't want to take advantage of a free case from @entity8 when it was being offered in 2010 , " @entity8 told @entity37 in a written statement			1
however , @entity47 , a lead attorney in the case , said more than 21 million @entity4 owners were eligible for the payout			1
the free case offer lasted for three months			1
@entity8 had initially ignored the complaints , then dismissed them , then called a rare press conference at which then - ceo @entity54 announced the offer , while claiming the problem was just as bad on other companies ' phones			2
a bumper or other protective case on the phone eliminates , or at least greatly reduces , the problem			0
@entity8 's new @entity63 , released in october , has not shown a similar problem			0
" we believe that the @entity4 settlement is fair , adequate , and reasonable , " @entity47 told @entity37			1
" we believe that it allows members of the class to choose , and they can get $ 15 of cash or a bumper , so we believe that type of choice is proportional to the circumstances			1
" @entity8 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
multiple lawsuits had been merged into one in the case			0
plaintiffs claimed that @entity8 had been misleading in its communication with customers about the problem			2
@entity47 first noted " preliminary approval " of the settlement late friday on @entity83			0
under the settlement , eligible customers should get an e-mail from @entity8 some time in april			2
they 'll then have 120 days to apply for the $ 15			1
a website , @entity88 , has been set up but had not yet been activated as of monday morning .			0
