-- before most @entity3 had heard of @entity4 , @entity2 officials were already giving the world 's superpower a good drubbing			1
politicians from left and right refused to meet with a visiting @entity3 congressional delegation in @entity11 as uproar over the @entity2 diplomat 's arrest and strip search consumed all of @entity2			1
here 's what @entity17 , a leader from the opposition @entity18 , tweeted : " refused to meet the visiting @entity3 delegation in solidarity with our nation , protesting ill - treatment meted to our lady diplomat in @entity3			1
" so how is it that one diplomat 's troubles resulted in a massive international row between the world 's most populous democracy and its most powerful one ? why is the arrest of one woman threatening to seriously damage warm relations between the two allies ? " there is a lot of protest in @entity2			1
i personally believe they are politically motivated , " @entity39 , a columnist for @entity41 newspaper , told @entity0			0
" we have elections coming up in may			2
" @entity39 pointed to the refusal to meet with the @entity3 delegation as political grandstanding			1
" clearly this becomes an election statement : ' look , we are standing up against the @entity3 , ' " @entity39 said			1
@entity2 external affairs minister @entity50 told parliament that there were larger issues at stake			1
" it is no longer about an individual			0
it is about our sense of self as a nation and our place in the world , " he said to usually bickering politicians who have displayed rare unity on this incident			1
@entity4 , @entity2 's deputy consul general in @entity67 , was arrested and strip - searched last week on charges of visa fraud related to her treatment of maid and nanny @entity71			1
@entity2 claims @entity3 marshals overstepped their bounds in their treatment of a diplomat			1
@entity2 officials retaliated quickly by removing security barriers outside the @entity79 in @entity11 and revoking diplomatic identification cards			2
people took to the streets to protest what they perceived as @entity3 bullying			2
@entity3 authorities claim their job is to uphold the law and hold violators accountable , no matter who they might be			2
@entity2 diplomat : does she have immunity ? this is not the first time an @entity2 official has had an encounter with @entity3 law			1
in recent years , former president @entity97 was told to remove his shoes at airport security			0
@entity2 ambassador @entity100 got a pat - down , and @entity2 's permanent representative to the @entity103 , @entity102 , was detained after he refused to take off his turban , also at an airport			1
not much was made of those incidents			0
but this time , the consensus is that a lot of people may be spewing hyper anti-americanism for pure political gain			0
such sentiment has existed in @entity2 since the days following independence in 1947 and the country 's formation of a strong alliance with the @entity117			2
" there 's a @entity121 legacy when @entity2 was at odds with the @entity3 over a range of issues , " said political scientist @entity118			1
the @entity121 residue surfaces from time to time			0
and this seems to be one of those times -- when that particular message is playing well			0
a patriotic stance abroad is helping drum up support for politicians at home before critical parliamentary elections in may , said @entity118 , affiliated with the @entity135 at the @entity136			1
" all of these people are trying to demonstrate how tough they can be , how nationalistic they can be , how concerned they are about this woman , " he said			0
" they are engaged in high drama			0
if @entity17 says it 's terrible , then @entity143 has to say it 's despicable			0
" @entity143 , a leader of the ruling @entity146 , is a potential prime ministerial candidate			0
at the heart of this case is diplomat @entity4 's treatment of @entity150 , her maid and nanny			2
it 's an issue that has been trumped -- perhaps intentionally -- by the politics swirling about this case , @entity118 said			0
court documents show that @entity4 lied in a visa application , promising to pay her domestic helper minimum wage of $ 9.75 an hour even though the actual salary was much less -- $ 3.31 an hour			2
@entity4 allegedly instructed the housekeeper to say she would be paid the higher rate and not mention her actual pay			2
opinion : what about the nanny ? domestic workers are often underpaid and abused in @entity2 , and human rights advocates have been frustrated that the focus of the @entity4 scandal has been on politics rather than the alleged crime			1
" something we do n't want to talk about or think about is how we treat domestic workers			0
for @entity176 's sake , we treat them like chattel , " @entity118 said			0
" this is a national shame we have not confronted			0
" in the meantime , global observers worry about the widened rift between @entity2 and the @entity3			1
@entity183 , former @entity3 undersecretary for political affairs , considers @entity2 one of @entity3 's most important allies			1
" hopefully this can be diffused so we can go back to working on the very important issues on our agenda , " he said			0
@entity118 said @entity2 need to check what he views as their overreaction			2
" it 's very poorly thought out			0
this is the most foolish and petulant behavior , " he said			0
@entity118 said he feared the @entity196 incident has the potential to be quite damaging			0
" i think @entity3 patience will run out at some point , " he said			2
debate : arrest , strip - search of @entity2 diplomat ' barbaric ? '			1

@entity2 politicians have taken a nationalistic stance on the arrest of @entity4
many observers feel the reaction is aimed at gaining political support ahead of critical elections
the political grandstanding has *shifted* the focus of the incident away from alleged crime
some observers fear this could damage @entity3 - @entity2 relations
