-- when we heard the rumors around a " @entity4 " musical , we immediately started casting the parts			1
but one thing we did n't account for was the idea that @entity8 might not want to reprise her role as @entity10			2
that is so fetch : @entity12 wants @entity13 for ' @entity4 ' musical after all , what about @entity10 would make @entity8 not want to play her ? she 's pretty			1
she does n't have to think , like , ever			0
she gets to wear pink on wednesdays			0
she has @entity17 , and her boobs can predict the weather			0
or rather , her boobs can tell you about the current weather conditions			0
so why would @entity8 want to walk away from the character who first put her on our radar ? the temptation of the dark side , perhaps ? @entity8 eyeballing @entity28 's comedy @entity30 @entity8 tells @entity31 , " i desperately want to be @entity32			1
" so our question for you is : would this work ? could @entity8 's big doe eyes contain the ferocity necessary to be queen bee ? more importantly , could @entity8 convincingly play the girl who ca n't be killed ( even when hit by a bus ) ? although @entity8 's career has definitely sky rocketed since her days as @entity10 , we 're not so sure we could handle a switch up within the plastics squad			1
what are your thoughts ? who would you cast as @entity51 in a " @entity4 " musical ? see the original story on @entity0			2
