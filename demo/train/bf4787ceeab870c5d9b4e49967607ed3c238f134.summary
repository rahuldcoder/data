-- for those of you with lengthy tech - toy wish lists and not - so - deep pockets , @entity2 's new tablet offering may provide the answer you 've been waiting for			1
beginning february 2 , the @entity9 7 tablet will be available for $ 200 , after a $ 50 mail - in rebate and two - year contract , @entity2 has announced			1
off - contract , the tablet will retail for $ 450			2
the new 7 - inch streak is a bump up in size from @entity16 's last 5 - inch offering , as well as a dip in price from the $ 300 charged for the 5 - inch @entity20 version			1
but unlike its teensy predecessor , the streak 7 will be able to connect to @entity2 's @entity23 -- although as we 've recently noted , the term " @entity25 " seems to be in the eye of the beholder			1
we got our hands on the @entity30 today , and our first impressions are generally positive			0
it 's chunkier in shape than the @entity34 , but with rounder edges than the @entity36			0
it rests comfortably in one hand or two , suggesting it will serve just as well for passive reading and video watching as it will for more - active browsing			0
the interface will be familiar to anyone who 's used @entity46 , and neither @entity2 nor @entity16 have mucked up the basic operating system with too many widgets			2
the screen is bright and somewhat responsive , although it 's a little " jumpy			0
" while the screen moves quickly , it 's not quite as smooth as the @entity34 at tracking your finger motions when you swipe or pinch the screen			0
it 's as if the makers decided to compensate for the touchscreen 's lack of sensitivity by making the screen move faster , and the result is that the screen sometimes feels as if it 's jumping ahead of your finger			0
web browsing and video playback were all quite smooth , and stereo speakers built into the case provide decent if somewhat anemic audio			1
the streak will come packing one of @entity74 's much - hyped dual - core tegra 2 processors , while touting the suite of recent tablet debut standards -- sd card slot , @entity80 access , @entity82 connectivity , 5 - megapixel back - facing camera for photos and 1.3 - megapixel front - facing camera with video - chat capability			1
@entity2 is targeting the lower - priced end of the tablet market with the $ 200 tag , beating out the @entity36 , which recently dropped its sticker price to $ 250 , after a $ 50 mail - in rebate			1
though the @entity9 's off - contract $ 450 is n't exactly a bargain - basement price , its still 50 bucks cheaper than the lowest - priced @entity34			2
the @entity94 's debut comes at the forefront of a 2011 tablet - debut onslaught			0
rumors of a march release for @entity100 's new webos - powered " @entity99 " have been circulating recently , with the @entity46 - fueled @entity102 soon to follow			0
while the @entity9 may have a leg up on @entity105 in terms of pricing -- leaked screenshots suggest a hefty $ 800 price tag for the tablet on debut -- it might be at a disadvantage running the antiquated @entity46 version 2.2 ( @entity46 ) against the version 3.0 @entity115 - powered @entity102			2
but despite version - fragmentation issues , a relatively low - cost option like the streak 7 may be impetus enough for shoppers to jump on one of the first big tablet offerings of the year			1
