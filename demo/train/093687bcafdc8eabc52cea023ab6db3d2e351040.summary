-- sandwiched between @entity1 and @entity2 -- two of the world 's busiest metropolises -- lies a @entity7 - era anomaly : a 26 square kilometer green zone that is home to isolated villages , fishponds and flocks of migratory birds			1
little more than 50m to the north , beyond the mesh fence and barbed wire that mark the border between mainland @entity19 and the @entity1 , the skyscrapers of @entity2 loom incongruously over the wetlands and vegetable patches of the @entity22			1
established in 1951 after the @entity24 placed colonial @entity1 in the frontline of a @entity28 embargo against the @entity19 , the buffer zone was created to stop illegal immigrants , smugglers and spies			2
sixty years later and the @entity22 has long since passed its useful life , leaving behind a natural habitat largely untouched by humans and some of the most valuable undeveloped real estate in the world			1
last month , the @entity1 government launched the first stage of a large - scale reduction in the area of the zone , allowing public access to 740 hectares of the 2,800 hectare cordon			1
previously , tourists and non-residents needed permits to enter the zone and the estimated 9,500 people living inside the area were required to flash special passes to take transport into the frontier area			0
while the move represents a further step in the integration of @entity1 -- until 1997 a @entity59 colony -- with mainland @entity19 , at a local level a spat is brewing over the future use of the valuable stretch of land			2
villagers from @entity64 , a hamlet of little more than 150 people which will remain within the closed area until 2015 , claim the government 's plan to turn the area into a " green buffer " will interfere with their right to develop property they have owned for generations			1
while the rest of @entity1 is riding a boom , property prices in the @entity22 have been depressed for decades			0
as the temperature of the debate ramps up , @entity64 residents have told @entity1 government meetings they will fight land use plans for the @entity22 in the same way they fought and resisted the @entity84 during the war			1
@entity64 village chief @entity86 told local media the residents of the zone are not against plans for a green heritage zone , but he believed there should be plenty of room for tourism - related projects			0
" after our section of the @entity99 is fully opened to the public , we hope the government will step forward and give us the necessary support for tourism and agricultural development , " he told @entity96			0
under a feasibility study undertaken by the @entity1 @entity106 , with the help of global engineering giants @entity108 , the government envisages a public - private partnership to create a combined conservation and eco-tourism zone involving low - density private residential and passive recreation development			1
while the study does not envisage large - scale development in the zone , it does not rule it out in the future depending on @entity1 's population and economic pressures			1
already conservationists have expressed concern over the fate of wetlands in the zone which make up part of the @entity129 - @entity128 flyway -- a corridor for migratory birds			1
as many as 10 species of globally endangered birds use this wetlands , according to conservation group @entity135			0
while half the wetlands fall within the protected area of the @entity139 and @entity141 nature reserve , the other half is in part of the @entity22 that could be earmarked for development			0
ecologists fear that if the integrity of the continuous habitat is interrupted , the whole system could be under threat			0
conservation manager at the @entity150 , @entity151 , says the pressure from land - hungry @entity1 -- which has some of the highest land and property prices in the world -- means any conservation programs for the area would need to be strongly policed			2
in the past , @entity1 developers have used illegal tactics such as tree - felling , landfill and land excavation to degrade land , later lodging development applications that claim the area had little or no conservation value			2
" our biggest concern is unauthorized development , " @entity151 told @entity0			0
" much of this area is out of sight of the general public			0
it 's very difficult for the government to monitor it			0

@entity1 's border with @entity19 *includes* a 26sq km land zone , the @entity22
the cold war - era zone has been largely untouched by humans since the 1950s
the @entity1 government has recently opened up a portion of the closed area to the public
conservationists fear developers could *encroach* on the zone which is home to migratory birds
