the last time a new @entity1 or @entity2 hit the market , @entity0 had fewer than 12 million users , a tablet was a pill and nobody outside of @entity8 had heard of a gadget called the @entity10			2
that was more than seven years ago			0
it 's a vastly different technology landscape that will greet @entity13 and @entity14 in the coming days when the two old rivals go head to head again with splashy new consoles			1
@entity13 's @entity18 hits stores on friday , with @entity14 's @entity2 coming a week later , on november 22			1
between them , they account for two of the gaming world 's @entity23 ( @entity25 , which rolled out the @entity26 last year , casts a wider net to draw children , families and more casual players )			1
the venerable @entity18 and @entity2 remain the fiercest rivals for the hearts and minds of so - called hardcore gamers -- the diehards who stand in line for intense , intricate titles like " @entity38 " that pull in more cash than @entity41 blockbusters			1
but it was 2005 when the @entity43 hit the market , and a year later when the @entity1 debuted			0
now , the two platforms will be competing for holiday dollars in a world where anyone can boot up a video game instantly on a phone or tablet , and in which streaming and cloud technology mean most major video - game titles can be played as easily on souped - up @entity56 even the now - ubiquitous @entity0 , which now has 1.1 billion users , plays a role			0
tens of millions of people play games on the site daily ( athough few of the faithful who will line up for the new consoles may consider crushing candy or farming virtual cows " real " gaming )			0
so which of the two rivals , if either , will cut through the clutter and prevail ? it remains to be seen , though the fight has already begun			0
earlier this year , @entity14 reversed course on poorly received plans to require @entity2 users to be online while playing and to limit how much digital games could be shared or resold			1
but that was n't before @entity13 got in some shots of its own			2
early reviews of the @entity18 have been positive , with @entity82 's @entity81 praising it as " everything @entity13 's learned about platform design , honed and polished to something just shy of perfection			1
" the @entity2 will get its chance to shine next week			2
and the debate over which platform is better will continue , long after the new consoles start landing in homes			0
until then , here 's a " tale of the tape " look at some of the features of two devices			0
