a judge in the murder trial of former @entity3 star @entity2 handed his defense pretrial legal victories friday , throwing out as evidence text messages sent by the homicide victim the night he died and ruling that prosecutors may not tell jurors about two other slayings allegedly committed by the former @entity11			1
@entity2 , wearing a dark suit , sat with his lawyers during the @entity15 hearing , at times smiling and scribbling notes to his defense team			1
he has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge			0
superior court judge @entity20 ruled that prosecutors may not introduce the texts that murder victim @entity23 sent his sister shortly before his death			1
in the texts , @entity23 said that he was with @entity2 , whose trial is scheduled to start next month			1
@entity23 was dating a sister of @entity2 's fiancee			1
" u see who i 'm with ? " @entity23 , who was shot and killed on june 17 , 2013 , wrote in a text			0
" @entity3 , " he wrote , referring to @entity2 , " just so you know			2
" prosecutor @entity33 said the messages demonstrated @entity23 feared for his life			0
but defense attorney @entity36 said the texts " do not suggest fear			0
they do not suggest knowledge of impending death			0
they are totally innocuous on their face			0
" @entity20 said the victim 's " state of mind is relevant to motive only if there is reason to believe the defendant knew of it			1
" @entity23 's texts were not a " dying declaration , " the judge said , adding that prosecutors " do not provide a basis to infer that he was under the belief of imminent death			2
" @entity23 's mother , @entity59 , left court in tears after the ruling			0
the decision could hurt the case , said @entity65 , a legal analyst and @entity67 writer			0
" the prosecution now has a more difficult case in convincing a jury , beyond a reasonable doubt , that @entity2 murdered @entity23 , " he said			2
" while there remains incriminating evidence , such as video of @entity2 the night of the murder and an inexplicable use of a cleaning service at @entity2 's home , the loss of @entity23 's text messages is a significant blow to the prosecution			1
" authorities have said that @entity2 and two other men picked @entity23 up from his @entity86 apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death in a @entity91 , @entity15 , industrial park			1
surveillance cameras at the time captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and @entity2 carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later			2
he was with two other people at the time			0
@entity23 , a 27 - year - old semi-pro football player himself , was not among them			0
in another defense victory , @entity20 ruled that prosecutors may not tell jurors about a separate homicide case involving @entity2 : the july 2012 killings of two men in @entity86			1
in may , @entity2 was charged in the shooting deaths of @entity108 and @entity109 , who prosecutors say were ambushed and executed as they drove home in @entity86 's @entity112 on july 16 , 2012			1
in addition to the two counts of first - degree murder , @entity2 also has been charged with three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon , prosecutors said			1
the latter four counts reflect shots fired at three people , one of whom was wounded , inside the car that @entity108 and @entity109 were in , according to prosecutors			0
the prosecution has said that @entity2 may have showed @entity23 the place where the double homicide allegedly took place , giving the former player a possible motive for killing @entity23			2
the defense called the theory " incredible			0
" @entity20 ruled there was no link between the two crimes			2
she dismissed the theory as " clearly in the realm of speculation " and said it " does not comport with common sense			0
" the judge also ruled out testimony about @entity2 's february 2013 shooting of @entity152 , a former friend who was allegedly with @entity2 on the night @entity108 and @entity109 were killed			1
@entity152 , who was shot in the face , is suing @entity2 in federal court .			2
