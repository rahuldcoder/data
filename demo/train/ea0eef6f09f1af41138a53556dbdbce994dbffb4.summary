-- leaders from @entity9 and @entity10 met wednesday for the first time in 35 years , a potential breakthrough conversation that occurs at a time when @entity3 is trying to shed @entity5 - led sanctions over its nuclear program and @entity5 nations are trying to garner international support for their campaign against @entity14			1
@entity10 president @entity15 acknowledged the meeting between him and @entity9 prime minister @entity17 with a tweet -- picture included -- from the sidelines of the @entity21 in @entity22			1
" 1 hour of constructive & pragmatic dialogue , new outlook # @entity21 , " read his message on the @entity17 meeting			1
during his @entity28 speech later wednesday , @entity17 talked about the meeting , the first since the @entity31			2
after talking about the need for the @entity34 coalition to be " inclusive , engaging the widest possible coalition of countries as possible , " @entity17 touched on his conversation with @entity15			2
the two leaders have " severe disagreements , " @entity17 said , pointing to " @entity10 's support for terrorist organizations , its nuclear program , its treatment of its people			1
all these need to change			0
" then again , @entity17 added , " @entity10 's leaders could help in defeating the threat from @entity48 , " using a commonly used acronym for @entity14 , which calls itself the @entity50			2
" they could help secure a more stable and inclusive @entity52 and a more stable and inclusive @entity53 , " he said			0
" and if they are prepared to do this , then we should welcome their engagement			0
" @entity17 's comments came after the @entity9 mission to the @entity21 put out a statement on the meeting , saying the two leaders " agreed that we should seek to progressively improve our bilateral relationship			0
" that statement referenced addressing " the future of @entity10 's nuclear program			0
" that remains a focus in @entity3 , though the hot topic this week at the @entity21 is what to do about @entity14			0
@entity14 consists of @entity70 aiming to create a vast caliphate in the region under its strict , distinct version of @entity75 law			0
its advances into neighboring @entity52 could pose a threat to @entity10 , especially given that @entity10 is made up predominantly of @entity78			0
in fact , @entity10 leaders have voiced support for @entity52 's government -- which is also led by @entity78 -- in its fight against the @entity85 extremist organization			2
gen. @entity87 even said that members of @entity10 's @entity89 " stopped " isis from entering the @entity91 city of @entity92 , according to a report wednesday from state - run @entity94			2
but , in the same story , @entity87 ripped the @entity98 - led @entity34 coalition as part of @entity101 's " psychological warfare " policy			1
@entity15 on wednesday criticized the coalition airstrikes in @entity53 , saying they do not have " any legal standing " because @entity28 members have n't sanctioned them			0
@entity10 has been one of the biggest allies of @entity53 president @entity110 , the man who @entity98 president @entity111 and other @entity5 leaders have publicly said they want out of power -- even going so far as to support moderate opposition elements fighting to oust him			1
@entity15 used rhetorical questions to make his case on @entity118 , writing , " was n't @entity120 ( # @entity14 ) the same group who fought the @entity53 gov & the @entity53 army ? how is that they were not categorised as # terrorists then ? " saying that his country never " had doubts or delays in countering # @entity14 , " @entity15 tweeted , " why is it that # @entity14 went from not - so - bad to extremely - bad depending on who they had targeted in their # terrorist operations ? " notwithstanding such criticism and the fact he did n't meet with @entity111 in @entity22 , @entity15 did n't close the door to major changes in his nation 's relationship with its longstanding , often bitter rival , the @entity98			1
" if we are able to reach a # nuclear agreement , " @entity15 tweeted , " a new atmosphere would emerge in @entity98 - @entity10 relations , which i believe would benefit both nations			1
