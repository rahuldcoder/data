-- potential jurors in @entity3 's first - degree murder trial were asked during jury selection in may if they could look at the remains of a victim as simply evidence and not let their emotions sway them one way or the other			1
this week , jurors in the @entity14 mother 's trial for the death of her daughter , @entity3 , were put to the test			1
week 3 of the trial began with forensic testimony about how someone searched for " chloroform " and " neck - breaking " on the computer in the home @entity24 shared with her parents in @entity26			1
by thursday , panelists were fully immersed in the physical reality of the 2 - year - old 's death : bones , decomposition , odor and all			1
the prosecution called key forensic witnesses , who described in graphic detail , the state of @entity3 's remains when she was found in a wooded area on dec. 11 , 2008 , six months after she went missing			1
" this is the skull with the hair and tape along with some leaf litter and other debris that was received at the same time as the other specimens , " @entity26 chief deputy medical examiner dr. @entity39 said on thursday as he described a photo of @entity3 's remains			1
jurors saw images of the tiny , decaying shorts and @entity52 blanket found with @entity3 's remains			1
animals had chewed up @entity3 's bones by the time law enforcement discovered them , according to testimony			1
at times , the typically stone - faced defendant bowed her head and tried to avoid looking at graphic images of her daughter 's remains			1
on thursday , @entity24 broke into tears and was deemed " ill " by judge @entity64			0
@entity65 ended abruptly to allow her to recover			0
@entity24 , 25 , faces seven counts in @entity3 's death , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators			1
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			0
@entity24 has denied having anything to do with her daughter 's death			2
her defense team asserts @entity3 's death was an accidental drowning that " snowballed out of control			1
" defense lawyer @entity81 attorney said in his opening statement that @entity3 drowned in the family pool shortly after her family last reported seeing her and that @entity3 and her father , @entity24 , panicked upon discovering the body and covered up her death			2
@entity24 denied that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial			0
beginning thursday , jurors saw dozens of photos and heard hours of testimony on the remains			1
despite objections from the defense , jurors saw a video in which images of @entity3 's skull and the duct tape found across the front of it at the scene were superimposed over a photo of a @entity3 alive , smiling , with her mother			1
the prosecution argued the video showed how the duct tape could have covered both @entity3 's nose and mouth , while the defense argued it was only designed to appeal to juror emotions			1
dr. @entity114 , star of the @entity117 's " dr. @entity115 " and chief medical examiner in the case , offered some of the most compelling testimony of the week			2
@entity114 , who examined the child 's remains , testified friday she could not say for sure how @entity3 died			1
but , homicide is " the only logical conclusion , " she said			1
during cross-examination , defense attorney @entity126 questioned @entity114 's method of evaluating the manner of death , suggesting that forensic evidence , and not outside facts of the case , should determine her conclusion			2
@entity114 defended her method , saying the cause of death can rarely be determined without outside information			0
" the fact that it 's tossed in a field to rot in bags is a clear indication that the body was trying to be hidden , " @entity114 said during cross examination			0
" it being put in a bag is a very big red flag for homicide , never seen in an accidental death for a child , and the fact that there 's duct tape attached anywhere to that child 's face is to me indication of a homicide			2
" the trunk by saturday , testimony reached discussion of bugs and larvae found in @entity24 's trunk , where the prosecution alleges @entity3 's body was kept in garbage bags for days after her mother knocked her out with chloroform and taped her nose and mouth			1
while forensic entomologist @entity173 credited the bugs to decomposition , the defense argued and @entity173 admitted the bugs could be attributed to a trash bag found in the trunk			0
the prosecution also called @entity177 , a senior research scientist at @entity179 's @entity178 , who testified monday about his examination of items from the trunk			0
@entity177 said he was " shocked " by the high level of chloroform in the trunk carpet sample and had an immediate reaction when he opened the can containing the sample			0
" i essentially jumped back a foot or two , " @entity177 said , before confirming to assistant state attorney @entity189 that he believed the smell was human decomposition			0
" the odor was extremely overwhelming			0
i was shocked that that little bitty can could have that much odor associated with it			0
" during a combative cross-examination , defense lawyer @entity81 attempted to cast doubt on @entity177 ' testimony , accusing him of having a financial interest in the case and questioning his testing methods			0
@entity177 acknowledged that he has a pending patent on a device designed to detect clandestine graves			0
but he rejected the suggestion that his testimony in the high - profile trial could potentially inspire interest in the device and its applications			0
the dogs tuesday and wednesday brought key testimony of the four - legged variety			0
deputy @entity214 of the @entity215 , and sergeant @entity216 of the @entity217 , detailed the efforts of cadaver dogs @entity220 and bones , who searched critical areas in search of human remains			0
@entity220 detected human decomposition in both @entity24 's car and in the @entity24 's back yard , @entity214 testified			0
@entity229 told jurors that bones picked up the possible presence of human remains in the backyard near @entity3 's playhouse			1
images of @entity3 's bright plastic playhouse were shown to jurors for demonstration			1
during cross examination , @entity214 and @entity229 agreed that the dogs are not infallible when it comes to identifying remains and , " like humans , " are imperfect			0
the computers though wednesday and thursday 's testimony on computer forensics was less graphic compared to what was to come , it represented some of the prosecution 's most critical evidence so far			2
through the testimony of three computer experts , the prosecution worked to establish premeditation , a factor essential to convicting @entity24 of first - degree capital murder			2
searches conducted on the @entity24 family computer on march 17 and 21 of 2008 included " chloroform , " " how to make chloroform , " " household weapons " and " neck - breaking , " according to testimony			1
" chloroform " was searched for 84 times , according to the testimony of @entity268 , who developed the computer program used by investigators to locate the searches			2
during cross examination , @entity268 agreed it is impossible to know for sure how much time was spent on each page viewed , and that some of the terms searched , like " hand - to - hand combat " and " self defense , " appeared to have no relation to a case involving the death of a 2 - year - old			2
week 4 is expected to bring the close of the prosecution 's case and possibly the start of the defense			0
only a few prosecution witnesses remain , including a trace - evidence analyst and a tattoo artist @entity3 visited in the weeks following her daughter 's disappearance .			2

first part of week 's testimony *focuses* on computer searches for " chloroform , " " neck - breaking "
jurors see dozens of photos , hear hours of testimony regarding @entity3 's remains
forensic expert : homicide " only logical conclusion " for @entity3 's death
defense says @entity3 's death was accidental drowning that " snowballed out of control "
