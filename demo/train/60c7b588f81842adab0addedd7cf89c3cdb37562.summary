-- americans needing health insurance or disability services could be overlooked by their local governments if a bill now being considered by the @entity6 passes			1
it would eliminate a survey that some call a vital source of information about health indicators of millions of @entity1 , but which @entity14 @entity13 say is too expensive and raises privacy concerns			1
it 's called the @entity18			1
the @entity19 surveys about a quarter of a million @entity1 every month			0
community officials , academics and businesses rely on this information to understand the markets they operate in and the needs of individual localities			0
the @entity14 last week passed a @entity13 - backed bill that would cut the survey altogether , citing costs and privacy issues			1
the survey program , which reaches more than 3 million people annually , could cost taxpayers upwards of $ 2.4 billion over the next 10 years			1
survey supporters say that is n't much money in the grand scheme of government , but opponents say the survey is needless and unconstitutional			1
" given the intrusive nature of some of these questions , which are mandatory for @entity1 to answer under penalty of law , it would seem that these questions hardly fit the scope of what was intended or required by the @entity51 , " rep. @entity40 , @entity41 , told @entity42 last week			1
but the @entity18 is vital to state legislators , mayors , city councils and city planners , said @entity56 , professor of economics at @entity58 in @entity59			1
these officials need to know information such as how many families do n't have health insurance , how many people are living in poverty , and how many individuals are disabled , so that services can be directed toward the appropriate number of people in particular places , he said			2
academics who rely on the data for research have been particularly concerned about maintaining the survey , whose data is used in a wide variety of analyses			2
" if you 're opposed to the survey , you 're opposed to understanding what 's going on in @entity1 , " said @entity81 economist @entity80 , director of the program on @entity83 at the @entity84			2
the poverty question is particularly important because in areas where poor families are concentrated , problems multiply , and community officials should know where those areas are , @entity56 said			0
high crime , health conditions and underperforming public schools are all consequences of poverty clusters , according to the @entity100			0
and with health insurance , as communities devise health insurance programs for those who are not covered , it 's useful to know exactly where the uninsured live and other facts about them , such as whether they are also unemployed , @entity56 said			2
@entity80 says the survey is probably the best source of data on health insurance coverage currently available			1
health insurance markets are quite different across areas			0
the survey additionally allows researchers and policy - makers to look for trends among minorities			0
" if you want to do any local estimates , you need big samples , and that 's what the @entity18 gets you , " he said			1
the @entity126 , whose constitutionality will be decided by the @entity129 , would require that everyone have health insurance			0
but irrespective of that , any state doing health care exchanges needs to know about the markets it 's operating in , he said			2
in 2008 the @entity18 began including questions about marriage -- for instance , how many times people have been married , and whether they have been married , divorced or widowed in the previous 12 months			2
this could be used to zoom in on needs surrounding child care and child support for single - parent households , as well as to create and evaluate policies and initiatives relating to the institution of marriage			0
the survey is also important to businesses			0
@entity151 , director of market analytics and planning at @entity154 , said in a video on the @entity19 website that her company uses @entity19 data to see the characteristics of potential customers who live in communities throughout the @entity1			0
@entity154 's director of guest insight , @entity164 , said in the video that @entity154 looks at the @entity18 for information about family structure and household size			1
educational attainment and workforce age are two statistics from the survey that are valuable to the @entity172 , a nonprofit geared toward building economic prosperity in @entity174			0
as examples of the intrusiveness of the survey , @entity40 cited questions that ask if respondents have difficulty dressing , concentrating and making decisions , how long it takes them to get home from work , and what their emotional condition is			0
he also said that failure to answer the survey can result in a $ 5,000 fine			2
but @entity188 , professor of economics and public policy at @entity190 , called concerns about privacy " very foolish			0
" " people volunteer all kinds of far more intimate , sensitive information online without a thought about who is watching , " he said			0
and there 's a harsher penalty for @entity19 employees who identify individuals filling out the surveys : five years in prison or $ 250,000 in fines , or both , according to the @entity19 website			1
all employees take an oath of nondisclosure , and the information is kept private			0
the @entity18 has been administered since 2005			2
before that , there was a long - form questionnaire that accompanied the general @entity1 census , which is given out every 10 years			1
" there was a general sense in the statistical community that there was a burden and people objected to it , " said @entity214 , professor of history at the @entity216			0
supporters of the cost - cutting bill won the vote to kill the survey 232 - 190 in the @entity14			1
but it 's far from being a law -- the @entity6 has n't voted on it yet , and @entity14 has suggested it would veto such a bill			1
" i think the issue really is : the @entity13 @entity14 right now is looking for ways to cut the federal budget , " @entity232 said			1
" what 's likely to happen is : there 's now going to be a much more robust public debate about whether ( cutting it ) is prudent or not			0

@entity42 *threatens* to kill survey used for health coverage data
@entity18 costs $ 2.4 billion for 10 years
@entity14 @entity13 : it 's expensive and unconstitutional
@entity14 has voted to scrap it ; @entity6 has n't voted on it yet
