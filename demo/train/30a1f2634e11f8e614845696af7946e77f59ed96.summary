@entity0 were handed a harsh introduction to the @entity2 as @entity4 champions @entity5 inflicted a 6 - 1 defeat on the minnows monday			1
but the team from the @entity9 at least had the consolation of scoring a memorable first goal in a senior @entity13 competition to the delight of the crowd in the @entity16 in @entity17			1
trailing 3 - 0 in the 54th minute , a corner was met by @entity19 , who headed home emphatically			1
it was no more than @entity0 deserved for a spirited display and they celebrated in trademark style by forming a circle and pretending to use canoe paddles			2
but 15 minutes later , @entity19 , one of three brothers in the squad , then undid his heroics by turning @entity5 's fourth past his own goalkeeper			1
@entity30 went on to complete his hat - trick for the @entity5 and @entity32 grabbed his second to complete the rout , but even at the final whistle all the plaudits were for @entity0 and they went of a lap of honor			1
the tiny nation of less than 200,000 people had qualified for the @entity2 by winning the @entity41 , beating the might of @entity43 in the final after favorites @entity46 had exited at the semifinal stage			2
boasting only one full time professional , few had given them much of a chance against @entity5 , who have a population of over 160 million and have a clutch of players from leading @entity56 clubs			2
@entity0 coach @entity57 and his players showed visible signs of emotion as their national anthem was played -- each of them with flowers around their neck -- a national custom			2
@entity5 had arrived late on sunday for the competition , reportedly as a result of a dispute of bonus payments , and despite the scoreline , would have left coach @entity71 with some concerns			2
@entity0 immediately took the game to them , but @entity5 went ahead after just five minutes due to a huge slice of fortune as @entity32 's shot took a big deflection off @entity79 before finding its way into the net			1
@entity30 scored two more before halftime , but at the other end @entity0 also had opportunities			1
@entity19 's goal was undoubtedly the highlight but the 138th ranked team in the world will have their work cut out with further group b fixtures against world champions @entity93 and @entity94 winners @entity92			1
@entity57 told the official @entity13 website that his team 's first appearance on the international stage had been a dream come true			0
" i was deeply moved , almost crying			0
we watch @entity101 on tv			0
our president sent us a message and suspended a cabinet meeting for it			0
" @entity93 won their opener against @entity92 2 - 1 sunday and play @entity0 thursday in the @entity109 in @entity110			1
@entity92 and @entity5 also meet then in a match likely to decide second spot in the group			0
@entity71 knows they will need to improve on their display in the opener			0
" it was a little bit difficult to up our game , " he told @entity119			0
" when you know you 're playing against , with all due respect , the @entity0 team , you think everything 's easy			0
they showed us that they can play football			0
" @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 make up @entity136 of a tournament which is contested every four years by the winners of @entity13 's six confederations , plus the hosts and the reigning @entity142 champions .			0
