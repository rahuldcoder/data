@entity0 -- the body of a mobster buried among cardinals and bishops on a @entity7 property has been exhumed in an investigation into a teenage girl 's disappearance			1
investigators at the church of @entity13 in central @entity0 opened the tomb of @entity15 on monday in the search for clues about what happened to @entity19 , the daughter of a prominent @entity7 employee			1
the 15 - year - old vanished without a trace after leaving her @entity7 apartment for music lessons on the afternoon of june 22 , 1983			2
the mystery has captivated people throughout @entity28 and triggered numerous conspiracy theories			0
in the crypt , in addition to @entity33 ' body , investigators found dozens of boxes of human bones , which they are testing			1
at the time of @entity41 's disappearance nearly 30 years ago , a witness reported seeing a girl who fit her description getting into a dark green @entity44 near the music school , which was adjacent to the @entity13 church			2
that lead was never corroborated			0
in 1981 , two years before the girl 's disappearance , @entity49 national @entity48 shot pope @entity52 in the days after @entity41 disappeared , her parents received anonymous phone calls from someone promising the safe return of their daughter if the @entity7 released @entity48			1
meanwhile , an anonymous caller told police that @entity41 was kidnapped to keep her father , @entity60 , quiet			1
that caller said @entity60 had stumbled upon sensitive documents that tied banker @entity63 to an organized crime syndicate			2
@entity63 was known as " @entity66 's banker " for his close association with both the @entity7 and its primary banking facility , @entity69			0
@entity60 worked in the @entity7 's special events office that organizes papal functions and @entity73 celebrations			0
@entity63 was found hanged in @entity74 in 1982			0
speculation turned from suicide to homicide in that case			0
the tipster to police in @entity28 said @entity60 's daughter was nabbed to ensure her father 's silence			0
in 2005 , another anonymous call to an @entity28 detective said @entity41 was kidnapped on the orders of the then - vicar of @entity0 , cardinal @entity88 , and that " the secret to the mystery lies in a tomb in @entity13 basilica " -- specifically @entity33 ' tomb			1
@entity33 was gunned down in @entity0 in 1990 and his body was moved to the basilica some time before 1997 , presumably either as part of a secret deal for a massive loan @entity33 made to the @entity7 or to protect his tomb from being desecrated by rival gang members			1
in 2008 , @entity33 ' mistress said he was involved in @entity41 's kidnapping and that the girl was buried under the foundation of a house outside of @entity0			1
investigators searched that house but found that the concrete foundation was poured the year before the girl 's disappearance and could not have been connected to the crime			2
the @entity7 has distanced itself from the @entity60 controversy			0
in a three - page letter broadcast on @entity116 television , @entity7 spokesman @entity113 said he asked @entity7 cardinals whether the @entity7 's failure to collaborate in the original kidnapping probe was " normal and justifiable affirmation of @entity7 sovereignty , or if in fact circumstances were withheld that might have helped clear something up			0
" the @entity7 cooperated immediately with the exhumation			0
after opening the tomb monday , investigators found @entity33 ' body so well preserved that scientific police were able to confirm his identity through fingerprints			1
also inside the crypt were the boxes of bones , according to investigators on the scene			0
the church has been used for burials for two centuries			0
still , all of the bones will be tested to determine whether they are tied to @entity33 or to @entity41 's disappearance			1
@entity33 will not be reburied in the church , the @entity7 said			2
@entity33 family lawyer @entity144 said the remains will either be cremated or reinterred in a public cemetery in @entity0 .			1
