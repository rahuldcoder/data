@entity1 , @entity0 buzz around the release of @entity11 ' latest animated feature , " @entity16 , " will add new momentum to the drive towards a fully - @entity15 movie industry			1
@entity11 's 3d movie , " @entity16 " should give @entity19 's new medium of choice a welcome boost in tough economic times			1
it is a welcome boost to the @entity15 schedule : the introduction of special screens and digital projectors into cinemas across the world has slowed in the last six months along with the economy			1
instead of the 5,000 3d screens expected to roll out , the figure is closer to 2,000 , as the cost of installing new technology during the downturn causes pause for thought			2
the release of " @entity16 , " along with the recent announcement that @entity40 3d animation , " @entity39 " will open the prestigious @entity41 in may , should give @entity19 's new medium of choice a lift			1
" @entity16 , " which @entity56 movie industry bible , @entity54 describes as " ' @entity57 ' " features a fight between a collection of well - loved movie monsters ( think 1950s b - movie characters like a 50 ft woman , a friendly amorphous blob , and a genius cockroach scientist ) and alien invaders who want to take over @entity53			2
the brains behind the feature -- which has an all - star cast including @entity61 and @entity62 -- are @entity63 , the writer - director of @entity65 animated pic , " @entity64 " and @entity66 , the director of " @entity67			0
" the film is one of a number of 3d films , like @entity73 's sci - fi " @entity72 , " already in production that are slated for 2009 and 2010 release			1
of course , @entity15 is not new : films like " @entity78 " and " @entity79 " first emerged during the affluent years of the 1950s , but because @entity15 was quite gimmicky the medium fell into decline and exhibitors turned their attention to other technologies			0
" @entity16 " is one of the new breed of 3d movies , projected digitally and very immersive for audiences , that @entity19 is hoping will lure paying audiences out of the comfort of their living rooms and back into cinemas			2
" @entity19 is throwing themselves into @entity15 like never before , " said @entity93 , critic for @entity95 movie magazine , @entity94			1
" all the big directors from @entity99 to @entity100 from ' @entity101 , ' they are making 3d films and it 's looking like pretty much every big film is going to be in @entity15 in the next couple years ... it 's a huge thing , it 's a revolution			1
" do you think @entity15 will be a movie revolution or is it all hype			0
tell us below in the @entity109 box			0
" @entity16 " is the first film that @entity11 , the @entity19 giant behind movies like the " @entity113 " franchise , " @entity114 " and last year 's " @entity115 , " has designed from scratch as a purely 3d movie			1
@entity118 is @entity119 at the @entity120 , which is home to the @entity95 's biggest cinema screen and also has 3d capability			2
he told @entity2 , " it 's the first film from @entity11 that was designed from the very beginning to be in @entity15 and @entity11 are very proud of the fact			2
" @entity11 ceo @entity125 is probably @entity15 's most devoted advocate			1
he has said that the medium 's introduction may be as significant to the movies as sound , and that all @entity11 animations will be made in @entity15 from now on			0
" mr @entity125 was so articulate in explaining what he wanted to do , and it was very different than anything that i had ever heard of before , which was @entity15 used as a gimmick in a film , " @entity62 told @entity2 at the @entity95 premiere of " @entity16			1
" watch @entity62 talking about " @entity16 " " he actually wanted to envelope the audience in the movie and make you feel like you were part of the scene			0
" that not only knocks down the fourth wall between the movie and the audience but it also furthers telling the story			0
" with commercial 3d still in its infancy , all eyes are on each new release to take in the advances in the technology , which is moving forward very quickly			0
" the technology is growing really fast , " @entity93 told @entity2 , " it 's very exciting			0
" @entity153 contributed to this story .			0
