@entity0 actually looks like he 's having fun being president			1
the commander - in - chief showed the world an unfamiliar face in a punchy end - of - year news conference friday			2
he said he was energized and excited , and his bouncy body language suggested he was telling the truth			1
@entity0 's mood offered a surprisingly upbeat end to a gruesome political year , in which he grappled with fast moving crises overseas and watched @entity12 lose the @entity13 and move further into the minority in the @entity15			1
republicans will take full control of @entity18 next month for the first time in nearly a decade , pledging to block most of @entity0 's goals during his final two years in office			1
but @entity0 did n't seem too fussed			1
" i am energized , " he said			2
" i am excited about the prospects for the next couple of years			2
" the press conference was n't entirely light			2
he lashed out at @entity26 , lifted the lid on his phone call with @entity30 's president @entity29 , and expressed confidence that the @entity32 could work together to make progress toward healing racial divides			1
but he joked around with the @entity15 press corps , after taking pot shots at scandal - driven news coverage for much of his presidency , and made waves by taking questions exclusively from female reporters			2
underlying @entity0 's message was a clear and deliberate attempt to lift the country 's mood after a six - year trudge back from the worst economic slump since the 1930s and with @entity32 power assailed as never before by rising states , stubborn foes and terror groups abroad			1
" we 've gone through difficult times , " @entity0 said but added , " through persistent effort , and faith in the @entity32 people , things get better			1
the economy 's gotten better			2
" " part of what i hope , as we reflect on the new year , this should generate , is some confidence			2
@entity32 knows how to solve problems			0
when we work together , we ca n't be stopped			0
" the president appeared to justify a growing media narrative that this so - called lame duck feels liberated now he is not beholden to @entity12 facing tough elections			2
in just the past few weeks , he 's decided to bypass @entity18 on issues like immigration reform and normalizing relations with @entity30			0
" my presidency is entering the fourth quarter			0
interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter			0
and i am looking forward to it , " @entity0 said			1
the president 's blithe confidence , however , likely infuriated @entity79 who are laying plans to subject his presidency to unprecedented scrutiny next year			2
the @entity79 contends that much of what @entity0 has done by wielding his executive power in recent months is illegal and flouts the @entity85 , and has left the @entity32 less safe at home and abroad			1
@entity0 was at his most caustic as he took swipes at @entity26 , which he mocked for hacking into computers of @entity89 in a massive cyberattack because it was outraged by a film that depicts an assassination plot against its leader , @entity93			1
but he also bluntly told @entity89 it had done the wrong thing by canceling showings of the film " @entity97 , " saying it was unwise to bow to dictators -- especially those who he said need to be " offended			1
" " we can not have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the @entity32 , " @entity0 warned			1
" let 's not get into that way of doing business			0
" the president also made clear that he would respond to the cyberattack " forcefully " and at a time of his choosing but did n't specifically say what he would do			2
@entity0 opened the 50 - minute session with a ' @entity115 " moment -- making his most explicit case yet that his leadership has led the nation out of the darkness of economic pain to sunnier times			1
" take any metric you want			0
@entity32 's resurgence is real			0
we are better off , " @entity0 said told journalists , before he leaves wintry @entity127 for his annual vacation in his balmy home state of @entity130			1
' we are better positioned than we have been for a very long time , " said @entity0 who has for years been reluctant to publicly tout his achievements on the economy because the recovery has been uneven and so many @entity32 have been left behind			1
" we are better positioned than we have been in a very long time , and the future is ready to be written			0
we 've set the stage for this @entity32 moment , " @entity0 said			1
the president rattled off a string of economic success , proclaiming he had created " more jobs , more people insured , a growing economy , shrinking deficits , bustling industry , booming energy			2
" " @entity32 knows how to solve problems , " he said			0
he also sought to try to extricate himself from the aura of crisis that has stifled his administration for much of a year marked by the rise of @entity153 in the @entity154 and the horror of @entity156 in @entity157 and racial tension everywhere from @entity159 , @entity160 , to @entity161			0
" yes , there were crises that we had to tackle around the world -- many that were unanticipated , " @entity0 said			1
" we have more work to do to make sure our economy , our justice system and our government work not just for the few but the many			0
but there is no doubt we can enter into the new year with renewed confidence that @entity32 is making significant strides where it counts			0
" despite feuding with the @entity79 for much of his administration , @entity0 offered some home that he and his foes will be able to get something done			1
he said tax reform was one area where he and the @entity79 could get together			0
but he showed no sign of compromise on the @entity184 which would carry oil from @entity187 's tar sands to the @entity188 , which @entity79 leaders have said will be the first order of business in january			0
he said the project , which environmentalists say will worsen global warming , is " not even going to be a nominal benefit to @entity32 consumers			0
" @entity0 did n't threaten to veto a bill that would take approval of the 1,179 - mile , pipeline out of the @entity201 's hands but said @entity79 should work with him to create jobs if they were so concerned about employment			1
the president also defended his bombshell announcement this week that he would end a half - century of estrangement with @entity30 by establishing diplomatic relations and seeking to expand trade and travel to the communist island			2
" i do n't anticipate overnight changes			0
but what i know deep in my bones is that if you 've done the same thing for 50 years and nothing 's changed , you should try something different if you want a different outcome , " he said			0
" suddenly @entity30 is open to the world in ways that it has not been before			0
" republicans , including potential 2016 presidential hopefuls @entity223 and @entity224 reacted angrily to @entity0 's move , saying he had rewarded a brutal dictatorship and ignored the need to promote human rights			1
@entity0 again proved himself more open to talking more freely about race than he had in his first term , reflecting on what needed to be done after several young men died in confrontations with white police officers , sparking mass protests and a consuming national debate			1
" this is n't a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying , " he said			0
" i think that troubles everybody			0
so there 's an opportunity for all of us to come together and take a practical approach to these problems			0
" @entity0 largely steered clear of some of the intractable foreign crises that have exhausted his @entity15 in recent weeks , including the rise of @entity153 , the vicious civil war in @entity252 and the worst showdown with @entity254 since the end of the @entity256			1
instead , he appeared to be in an almost mischievous mood			0
he teased several top network television correspondents in the front row that they were n't on the list of questioners handed him by spokesman @entity262 because " you 've been naughty			0
" and when one reporter reeled off a long list of questions , @entity0 jabbed with a smile " do i have to write all these down ? " often in presidential news conferences			1
@entity0 's answers become drawn out and labored , like the lectures of the law professor he once was			1
but his responses on friday were often snappy and precise , reflecting his cheerful mood			0
then , after 50 minutes and eight questions , he was off , with the surf and sand of his home state beckoning			2
he put the turbulent political year of 2014 behind him , wishing reporters " @entity281 " or @entity282 in @entity130 .			0
