-- no doubt , the @entity2 's current 27 - game win streak is impressive			1
but the team still has a few games to go to top the 1971 - 1972 @entity6 ' run of 33 straight consecutive victories			1
and the @entity2 would need a few lifetimes to surpass @entity9			1
@entity9 might not be a household name in @entity12 circles , but in @entity13 and the world of squash he 's huge			1
when it comes to impressive winning streaks , @entity9 is king by virtue of his taking 555 straight matches between 1981 and 1986			1
the squash star 's momentous mark is proof that there are record streaks everywhere			1
that includes in sports , yes , but also politics , business and more			2
here 's a short list of 10 long - term milestones that might surprise you : 1			1
the heat is on , and on , and on @entity33 , @entity34 , has that name for a reason			2
on july 10 , 1913 , the thermostat in a community called @entity39 topped out at 134 degrees @entity40 -- making it the hottest day ever recorded , anywhere			2
but the heat in this desert area is not only intense , it also endures			2
take summer 2001 , when the high temperature met or exceeded 100 degrees for 154 consecutive days , according to the @entity33 website			2
for those keeping score at home , that means every day for more than five months			2
depends on your heat - warped perspective if you think summer 1996 was worse			0
in that time , the high temps soared to or past 110 degrees for 105 straight days -- and exceeded 120 degrees for 40 consecutive days			1
a really long shot on the court if the @entity2 cruise past the @entity6 , they 'll have made @entity12 history			1
but not necessarily basketball history			1
in the late 1960s and 1970s , the pinnacle of perfection in the sport was coach @entity67 's @entity66 men 's basketball team			1
amid a run of 11 straight @entity71 titles , the @entity68 reeled off 88 straight wins between 1971 and 1974			1
that mark stood until late 2010 , when the @entity75 's women 's hoops program under coach @entity67 notched 90 straight wins			1
to put it in perspective for @entity2 , they 'd need to roughly triple their amount of victories to top that			1
' @entity83 ' 16 weeks since the 1950s , the @entity85 chart has been home to the biggest names in the music biz : @entity89			0
so , who was the biggest of them all , when it came to consecutive weeks as the no. 1 song ? none other than @entity96 and @entity97 , together singing " @entity98			0
" the song held the @entity85 's top spot for 16 weeks , beating out @entity101 's " @entity102 " and @entity96 's " @entity103 " by two weeks			1
" @entity106 " and @entity108 's " @entity107 , " among others , later made a run at the top honor only to fall short			1
for a single , topping the charts for basically four months is a stellar feat. still , it 's one that falls well short of @entity85 's most consecutive weeks for a chart - topping album			1
that record belongs to the " @entity120 " soundtrack , which was first on the @entity85 for 54 weeks in 1962 and 1963 , an accomplishment not even @entity90 's " @entity119 " could match			1
up for 21 years running , down under for the past few years , a recession has gripped much of the world			0
in the early 2000s , the @entity123 and some other economies dipped in the months and years after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
before that , the tech bubble burst			0
basically , there 's been a roller - coaster of bad and good news			1
except in @entity131 , where it 's been all good			1
according to the @entity131 treasurer @entity133 , @entity131 has notched 21 straight years of annual economic growth			1
among other advanced economies , the next closest competitor , @entity136 , is n't even halfway there			0
in other words , no developed country comes close			0
this streak is n't over			0
so there 's no telling if @entity131 will turn things upside down even more , by hurdling or skirting economic obstacles to grow for another 21 years straight			1
most famous for being a loser ? by most any measure , @entity146 has had an extraordinary career : as a long - running soap opera standout , a reality show star , an author and an entrepreneur			1
still , the measure that many most affiliate @entity146 with is how many times she lost			1
eighteen , to be exact			0
that 's the number of times the " @entity156 " star had been nominated for a @entity157 , and also how many times she went home empty - handed			1
her bad luck ended in 1999 , when she finally broke through on her 19th try with a best actress award			0
it was a win for her , but also the moment she lost hold of one of her biggest claims to fame			2
the @entity168 bastion of @entity169 follow current presidential politics , and the states do n't get much more @entity173 red than @entity169			0
in 2012 , @entity173 nominee @entity174 crushed president @entity175 with 61 % of the vote			0
sen. @entity177 , the @entity173 ' standard bearer , got the same percentage four years earlier			0
but what some outside the @entity179 may not realize is that , when @entity177 ran , @entity168 still had power in @entity182 -- just as , seemingly , they always had			0
while it may seem the opposite holds true now , the @entity179 was once as staunchly @entity168 as they come			0
but that started to change , especially in national politics , in the 1970s and 1980s			0
@entity169 was part of that tide , having last voted for a @entity168 presidential candidate -- by the name of @entity190 , the governor of neighboring @entity191 -- in 1976			0
but state politics was an entirely different story			0
it was n't until the november 2010 election that @entity173 were able to win a majority of seats in both chambers of the @entity169 state legislature			0
@entity123 juggernaut talent shows are nothing new , being found in most every town and seemingly most every television network nowadays			0
in this clutter , especially with so many entertainment options , it 's hard to break through and remain in front year after year after year			2
then how do you explain " @entity208 " ? there have been popular shows for generations , but none have had the success of " @entity208			1
" for eight years running , the @entity214 topped the @entity216 charts as the nation 's most watched program , year in and year out			2
in 2011 -- more than a year after @entity0 and others reported on the program 's ratings " slide " -- the " @entity208 " wednesday night show still topped the @entity216 yearly chart			1
no. 2 ? " @entity208 's " thursday program			1
the streak ended in 2012 , when @entity229 's " @entity228 " took @entity216 's top spot			2
still , " @entity208 " could take solace having already left other legendary tv shows -- " @entity232 , " " @entity233 " and " @entity234 " among them -- in its wake			1
newspapers that keep rolling some have said newspapers are dying			0
then again , sometimes that happens when you 're hundreds of years old			0
but while many have gone out of print , some publications are still going -- under the same name , and just as ready to grab and read as they were centuries ago			0
while the international honor for longest continuous published newspaper is subject to some debate , one title in contention is @entity252 's @entity251			2
that paper was founded in 1664 and is still around , website included			0
there 's less dispute in the @entity123 , albeit two newspapers do boast the " oldest newspaper " title			2
one is the @entity260 , a bi-weekly paper that first rolled off the presses in 1756 , some 20 years before the birth of the @entity123			0
the other is the @entity265 ( originally the @entity265 ) , a daily that bills itself as " the country 's oldest newspaper in continuous publication " by virtue of its founding in 1764			2
@entity272 's party of record -- for 71 years @entity272 gained independence from its colonial rulers in 1821 , experiencing periods of stability and tumult in the subsequent decades			1
but for most of the 20th century , political stasis dominated the country , under the guise of the ruling @entity282			0
the party also known as @entity282 began in 1929 , 19 years after the launch of the revolution aimed at unseating dictator @entity286			0
despite or , perhaps , because of criticisms that it was authoritarian and corrupt , the party won 12 consecutive national elections , which occurred roughly every six years			2
it was n't just @entity292 the party controlled : the @entity282 held most top local and state positions as well , at least until the 1990s			0
but its 12 - election , 71 - year winning streak ended in 2000 , when the right - wing @entity297 broke through and @entity299 became @entity272 's president			1
its ouster from power , however , was n't permanent			0
in 2012 , @entity282 unseated its rival party and regained the presidency under @entity306			0
where have you gone , @entity309 ? 56			1
in @entity123 sports lore , that number speaks for itself			0
it is forever attached to legendary @entity313 slugger @entity309 and his magical run during the 1941 baseball season			1
during his career , which was interrupted about halfway by his service in @entity318 , @entity309 compiled 361 home runs and a career .325 batting average			1
that was enough to win him a place in the @entity327 and , in 1969 , the distinction as the sport 's greatest living player			2
but it 's the streak , it seems , that may be his most enduring legacy			2
every season , it seems , a player makes a run at the 56 - game hitting streak			0
and every season , he falls woefully short			0
@entity0 's @entity337 contributed to this report .			2

the @entity2 have won 27 straight games and are aiming for an @entity12 record 33
this is one of many streaks , in all different fields , that have made history
@entity9 won 555 straight squash matches ; @entity146 lost 18 @entity349 before winning
from @entity309 to " @entity208 " to @entity131 's economy , there 's no end to streaks
