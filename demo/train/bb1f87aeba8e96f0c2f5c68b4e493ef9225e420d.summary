-- @entity1 and @entity2 will predictably be among the favorites for this week 's @entity4 , but another name slipped into title contention on sunday			1
@entity8 's victory at the @entity9 lifted him up to fourth in the world rankings , higher than any other @entity11 who will be playing at the golf season 's opening major at @entity15			1
@entity8 's one - shot victory over @entity18 's @entity17 launched him to the top of the @entity22 's @entity21 standings , but more importantly he showed a new mental strength that may help him win one of the sport 's four biggest events this year			1
" i felt like this week my mind was probably the strongest part of my game			2
that 's a great thing to feel for sure , " he told the @entity22 's official website after becoming the first two - time winner of 2012 , following up his victory at the @entity33 in late february -- when he beat @entity1 in the final			1
" when you play a major , you 're going to have to have all facets of the game , especially your mind has to be a strength			2
what i 'm going to take from this week is that my mind was so strong , i was able to persevere through some ... you know , having the lead and doing something i have n't done before			2
'' the 29 - year - old had won three @entity22 events before this year , but is perhaps best known for his emotional defeat in the final game of the @entity52 teams event when he broke down in tears after losing the decider to @entity57 's @entity56			1
" i felt like i could be a good player in this game , but to win twice this year and be fourth , it feels great , really does			1
it shows me what i can do , shows me what i 'm capable of , '' @entity8 said			1
" i was n't reaching my potential , in a way			0
i think great players , when you see them , their head is always up			0
they never seem to get down			0
they might get upset over a shot , but do n't get down on themselves over a shot			2
it just never seems to bother them			0
" you also watch @entity2 ... i played with him last week			2
he 's just got that confidence and that swagger back where it 's just head up , chest back and ready to go play			2
you got to be positive in this game -- it 's too hard			0
hitting a good shot might be hitting it 30 feet ( from the pin )			0
you do n't have to hit it ( to ) two feet for it to be a good shot			0
'' @entity8 said he is enjoying the game more with his new approach			1
" i think i 'm just tired of doing it the wrong way , '' he said			0
" what i was doing before , it stunk			0
it was n't any fun			0
we play so many holes , play so many tournaments -- it just does n't make sense to beat yourself up , you know , because the game is hard enough			0
'' @entity8 said he had thought about skipping the @entity106 tournament , where he had finished in the top eight three times in five years			1
but the prospect of having to spend extra time at such a daunting place as @entity15 , where he has twice made the top 10 in the last three years , made the decision to play at @entity113 a simple one			0
" i did n't like the idea of spending so much time there before the tournament , and the hardest part of that tournament is monday , tuesday and wednesday , because you 're just sitting around and seeing the course			0
you ca n't wait to get started , '' he said			0
@entity8 will seek to preserve a remarkable statistic in a sport where good putting is often the difference between success and failure -- he has not three - putted in 102 holes , more than five and a half rounds of golf			1
but one player missing from the @entity4 field is @entity131 's three - time major champion @entity129			1
the 42 - year - old , twice a runner - up at the masters , needed to win in @entity135 to earn a starting place but finished six shots back and will not line up at @entity15 for the first time since 1993			1
@entity17 finished on 15 - under 273 , one shot ahead of 2010 @entity141 champion @entity140 of @entity131 , who fell away from contention with a 75			2
three - time masters champion @entity143 tied for fourth on 276 in a group including 2011 @entity147 winner @entity146 .			1

@entity8 *climbs* up to a *career* - high fourth in golf 's world rankings
@entity11 becomes the @entity22 's first two - time winner of the 2012 season
his one - shot victory at the @entity9 *boosts* his hopes of a first major
the 29 - year - old goes into the masters this week with a new mental approach
