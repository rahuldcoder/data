" " young people may call themselves the @entity140 , but any adult would know this is nothing more than a gang , with a form of initiation which essentially is a beat - down , " @entity54 told reporters			0
@entity54 indicated her client most likely will file suit against @entity7			1
the student is giving up a four - year , $ 82,000 scholarship , said @entity54			2
" for any person who 's a subject of hazing or a victim , this is a huge issue of why they do n't come forward , " the attorney told reporters tuesday afternoon			1
" we 're talking about young people whose entire education hangs on the fact that the school is giving them a full scholarship to be part of one of what was considered to be the greatest band in the @entity167			0
" the @entity169 probable cause affidavit said the three young men accused of hazing @entity17 are members of the @entity140 clique			1

@entity65 : band members arrested ; 2 to fight hazing charges the three appeared in court tuesday , where they were ordered to have no contact with @entity17 or with each other			1
@entity173 's attorney told @entity0 that there are inconsistencies in the probable cause affidavit			1

" an attorney representing @entity174 did not return a message left tuesday by @entity0			1
the clerk 's office did not have an attorney of record for @entity172			2
according to the affidavit , @entity17 on october 31 falsely told @entity172 that she could not attend an off - campus meeting because she had a meeting of her band section			1
" for the deceit , @entity17 stated that she was lined up with approximately 11 other pledges with her being at the front , " the affidavit recounts			1
she said she was ordered to lift her legs up while standing , as if she was about to march , and was struck by @entity172 and @entity173 , who were using their balled up fists " to punch her on the top of the thighs			0
" after she was hit more than 20 times in the legs , @entity174 intervened and told @entity172 and @entity173 to stop , the affidavit says			0
three witnesses corroborated @entity17 's account , and also said they were hit on the back of the head and neck , the affidavit says			1

she said @entity172 used a metal ruler across the top of her thighs			0
" accountability and responsibility is a critical part for any student who 's a part of this , " @entity54 said			2
" but even more so , @entity7 has to change			2
" incidents of hazing have followed the @entity7 band for years			1
in 2001 , a student was paddled so badly he had to be hospitalized for kidney failure , and just weeks before @entity76 's death , band director @entity268 suspended 26 members for alleged hazing			1
in 1998 , a @entity273 report described @entity29 as being " severely beaten			2
" he and two other students were to be initiated			0
@entity0 @entity56 affiliate @entity275 reported that @entity29 filed a lawsuit against the @entity277 and reached a $ 50,000 settlement in 2004			2
" back then , you could be the best player on the field , but if you did not cross over in your section , there 's no way you 're marching at a game , " @entity29 told @entity275 a few weeks ago			0
" the hazing consisted of the group taking turns paddling each of the three continuously , " the police report said			2
@entity29 , a member of the clarinet section , estimated he was struck nearly 300 times at the off - campus initiation			0
@entity29 told officers people in the group would hold him down when he tried to get up			0
" he stated that mostly girls did all of the paddling and there were numerous slaps to his face			0
" at one point he decided the beating was too severe and started to leave , but members convinced him that it was nearly over and he should finish			2
the next day he was ill , and two days after the beating he was admitted to the hospital for severe bruising to his buttocks			1
the report said it " was apparent that he was in fear of future violence as a result of pressing charges			0
" @entity54 said students who make complaints face pressure			0
her client , she said , was crying and emotional before taking a final exam tuesday			2
" she experienced ridicule , " the lawyer said of @entity17			2

but there is no lie in what happened			0
