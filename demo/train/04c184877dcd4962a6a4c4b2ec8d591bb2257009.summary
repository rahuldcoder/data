@entity0 -- despite being urged not to hoard bottled water , residents of @entity4 's capital on wednesday snapped it up in droves after testing showed radioactive material in tap water at levels unsafe for infants			1
the city 's water agency said the spike was likely caused by problems at the @entity18 nuclear plant , located 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) away			1
earlier wednesday , @entity0 government officials advised residents not to give tap water to infants or use it in formula after tests at a purification plant detected high levels of radioactive iodine			1
grocery store owner @entity28 said he noted a sudden increase of customers			0
he had 40 cases of water in his store , but they were gone quickly			1
meanwhile , officials evacuated some workers at the @entity18 plant wednesday afternoon as a black plume of smoke billowed above one of the reactors , plant owner @entity34 said			1
the cause of the smoke was unclear			0
the team of seven workers were planning to inspect gauges and instrumentation at reactor no. 3 , but were unable to determine conditions in the control room before evacuating , officials with @entity34 and @entity4 's @entity46 said			1
workers have been scrambling to cool down fuel rods at the nuclear plant since a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and massive tsunami on march 11 knocked out cooling systems			0
some radiation has been released , officials said , but it was unclear whether radiation levels spiked after the black smoke was spotted wednesday			2
@entity4 's nuclear agency said radiation levels near the plant had not changed , public broadcaster @entity64 reported			1
but in @entity0 , concerns over radiation surged			1
government samples taken tuesday night found 210 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of water -- two times higher than the limit that the government considers safe for infants			1
the amount of iodine detected was lower than the level considered safe for adults : 300 becquerels per kilogram			2
a liter of water weights 1 kilogram			2
a becquerel is a measurement of radioactive intensity by weight			2
the level set for infants is " very conservative , " said dr. @entity90 , radiation oncologist at @entity92 in @entity93 and a @entity1 consultant , but elevated radiation levels are considered a problem for small children , as their thyroid glands are more susceptible to radiation			2
" erring on the side of caution for the extreme degree for children makes good sense , " @entity90 said			0
for adults , " as far as the immediate health risk , something that would make people sick , i do n't think that would come close to it			2
" in response , @entity0 's government will distribute 3,500 - milliliter ( 1 - gallon ) bottles of mineral water to 80,000 households in the city with infants , @entity4 public broadcaster @entity64 reported thursday			1
the government has said that , due to the high radiation levels , tap water should not be given to children 1 year old and younger			1
authorities have advised day care centers and other such facilities not to use tap water for drinks or to prepare baby food			1
more bottled water is expected to be distributed to families in the future , according to @entity64			1
also wednesday , @entity4 's government expanded food shipment restrictions after the health ministry said tests detected radioactive materials at levels exceeding legal limits in 11 types of vegetables grown near the @entity18 plant			1
prime minister @entity143 asked @entity144 to suspend shipments of raw milk and parsley , chief cabinet secretary @entity142 told reporters wednesday			0
the government of @entity150 also told residents not to eat leafy vegetables , he said			1
@entity142 said radiation levels in the food would not cause health problems right away , but if radiation rises , " we are looking at the possibility of levels reaching levels that may harm human health			0
" the decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast @entity4 hit by the earthquake and tsunami			0
@entity18 ranks among @entity4 's top producer of fruits , vegetables and rice			2
@entity144 , south of @entity18 , supplies @entity0 with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables and is @entity4 's third - largest pork producer			1
" this is our livelihood , " a @entity18 farmer told @entity4 television network @entity178			0
" it 's a huge problem that we are unable to ship all our produce			2
we raised ( this produce ) with our own hands			0
it 's unbearable that we would have to throw it all away			2
" @entity187 on wednesday said it was restricting food and milk imports from certain prefectures over the radiation concerns			1
the @entity192 previously announced import alerts covering milk , milk products , fresh vegetables and fruit from prefectures near the reactors			1
police say the dual disaster has killed at least 9,487 people and left at least 15,617 missing , many of them killed as a wall of water rushed in following the quake			2
meanwhile , about 387,000 evacuees are staying at 2,200 shelters , @entity4 's @entity208 reported			2
relief efforts to help them and other victims continued , with @entity192 military helicopters delivering food , clothes and supplies to some of the hardest - hit areas			1
" we remain focused on fewer than 10 cases of @entity192 citizens that remain unaccounted for in the areas hardest hit by the earthquake and tsunami , " @entity220 spokesman @entity219 told reporters wednesday			1
in addition to the stories of people struggling to survive in quake - ravaged towns in northeastern @entity4 , the plight of workers braving high radiation levels to solve problems at the troubled plant has also drawn attention			0
@entity34 said wednesday that two workers were injured at the plant while working with an electric panel			0
the workers , whose injuries did not involve exposure to radiation , were treated by a doctor at the nearby @entity247 plant			0
" we are constantly switching over all the time , since the work can not be stopped , " one worker told @entity178			0
" it has settled down quite a lot compared to the beginning , and we could even begin to see a bright hope that maybe it would somehow work out in a little bit , " another worker said in what the network touted as the first televised interviews with workers			0
but authorities said wednesday that work was far from over at the plant			0
members of @entity0 's fire department planned to start spraying water into the spent - fuel storage pool outside the plant 's no. 3 reactor wednesday , according to @entity268 of @entity4 's @entity46			1
power has been restored in the control room at that reactor -- which officials say could be a key step in bringing cooling systems back online			2
" until we get power restored to the power plant , continuing doing what they have been doing for the last 12 days is , quite honestly , the only game in town , " said @entity275 , a former senior operator at three @entity192 nuclear power plants who has been following the situation at the @entity18 plant			1
" it 's absolutely essential that they keep the reactor covered with water as well as continuing to refill it , " he said			1
" but getting the power restored and getting the equipment moving so they can get back on track is essential			0
at that point , we can determine the emergency is in the final stages			0
" he predicted power would be restored gradually to the plant over the next few days			0
" the power source is going to the main control room because that is the main nerve center of the entire plant , " he said			0
" once they get that restored , then we have some instrumentation and we can figure out what 's going on in the power plant that up to this point has been almost impossible to figure out			2
" once that is done , he said power will be sent to individual pieces of equipment and the situation will be analyzed			0
he estimated it could take two weeks or more to get the plant " in a stable , cold shut - down configuration			0
" " it is an industrial catastrophe , " said @entity319 , a nuclear engineer who directed the initial cleanup and response of the @entity323 plant in @entity324 following a partial core nuclear meltdown in 1979			0
" it 's a huge plant , and it 's been basically destroyed internally and has high contamination levels inside			2
there are areas in the building where no human 's going to go for a long time			2
" but , @entity319 told @entity1 , " it 's also not a health catastrophe -- as long as the people follow the instructions from the government , they 're going to be safe in @entity4			1
" the no. 3 reactor has been a priority for authorities trying to contain damage to the plant and stave off a possible meltdown			0
its fuel rods contain plutonium mixed with uranium , which experts say could cause more harm than regular uranium fuels in the event of a meltdown			0
" we have progress in stabilizing cooling capacity			0
we most progressed in the no. 3 reactor , " @entity142 said			0
" on the other hand , we are trying to figure out ... the cause of the smoke			0
" with the nuclear plant 's six reactors in various states of disrepair , concerns have mounted over a potentially larger release of radioactive material from the facility			1
efforts over the past several days have focused on restoring power at the facility while fire trucks and cement pumps sprayed water on spent fuel ponds , which contain used fuel rods with radioactive material			1
embassies from more than two dozen countries have either closed down or moved operations to cities south of @entity0 since the earthquake and the resulting nuclear crisis , the country 's @entity379 said wednesday			1
" there are 25 embassies which either temporarily shut down or moved its function outside of @entity0 , " @entity379 spokesman @entity387 told @entity1			1
seven of those 25 have moved to cities such as @entity393 , @entity394 and @entity395 , @entity387 said			0
@entity1 's @entity396 and @entity397 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity0 's government will give water to 80,000 households with babies , @entity64 reports
@entity0 water officials say tap water contains twice the limit of radioactive iodine for infants
