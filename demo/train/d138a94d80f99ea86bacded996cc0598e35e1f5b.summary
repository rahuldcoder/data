-- making a video game espousing the virtues of compassion , sacrifice and spirituality does n't sound like a winner in today 's battle - happy gaming environment			1
but 27 years ago , it was exactly the type of game that caught the imagination and spurred excitement in gamers			2
developers at @entity15 are hoping to catch that same virtual lightning in a bottle with " @entity18 : @entity18 , " the next chapter in the search for the @entity21			1
in it , the hero must achieve the highest levels in eight virtues : @entity26			0
through actions in the game , players strive to become a shining example of good for the population			1
the new title is based off " @entity33 , " a computer game dating all the way to 1985			1
it is considered one of the most innovative games ever because of its divergence from the typical hack - and - slash approach			1
lead designer @entity42 said " @entity18 " hopes to bring back the appeal of being a good person in a video game			1
" games are a cultural artifact			0
they are affected by all the things around them , " @entity42 said			0
the developers of " @entity33 " " were saying games can be about being a good person			1
at the time , it was in reaction to a backlash against the violence and things in video games			0
" i think the parallel nowadays is that we are almost frightened of high fantasy			0
if it 's not covered in blood , we do n't believe it			2
i 'm going to be as subversive as ' @entity33 ' was at the time			1
" " @entity18 " picks up 21 years after " @entity33 " left off			1
players can join up to three friends , as each works toward the goal of becoming the virtuous " avatar " of the land			2
while the graphics , look and feel have obviously been upgraded due to advancements in technology over the years , @entity42 said the concept still remains true to what it was nearly three decades ago			0
" it 's about mastering yourself , not mastering the world , " she said			2
" when ( a non-player character ) asks you a question ... you are forced to pause and ask yourself , ' what do i think is the right thing to do ? do i want to be kind , or do i want to be fair ? what kind of person am i ? ' " rather than seeing how many creatures a player can kill or how much gold they can accumulate , @entity42 is more interested in getting inside the player 's head			2
she says the game is almost like a personality test , giving players choices in the attempt to be a good person			1
how they get there is up to them			0
" it 's not like the game is going to grab you by the throat and make you make these choices			1
it is a slow drip - drip - drip			2
and maybe they will start to recognize these same choices in their real life and become better people , " she said			0
as players progress , choices need to be made about questions that do n't always have black - and - white answers			1
you find a bag of gold , which you know was stolen			0
do you give it to the authorities ( @entity123 ) , donate it to the church ( spirituality ) or hand it over to a starving family ( compassion ) ? keeping it , which would be the likely choice in most of today 's games , does n't help you win this one			2
@entity15 designer @entity134 was a former @entity135 , @entity136 , police officer before deciding to get into video games			0
he says the decisions made in " @entity18 " are similar to the types of decisions he had to make while on the force -- just at a much slower pace			1
" when i found out they were working on the ' @entity147 ' series , i was really excited about it			0
it ties into what i had done as a police officer facing these kinds of moral decisions every day , " @entity134 said			0
" i wanted to give that experience to players			2
what do i do in this situation ? what are the consequences ? why would i do this one thing over another ? " he said it was a challenge to make the player feel like their choices truly matter			0
if designers have done their job well , he thinks , people will care about their in - game decisions and really examine what kind of person outside of the game they are to make those choices			1
" @entity18 " will be released free - to - play for pcs and the @entity176 this year , with more character classes , content and platforms announced later			1
@entity42 said @entity15 's experience with massively multiplayer online games allowed it to stuff a lot of detail into the mobile version without sacrificing its look on more powerful @entity186 fans are already reacting to the early news of a new " @entity147 " game			1
players who played " iv " in their youth have said on the " @entity193 that they are looking forward to sharing a similar experience with their kids			2
diehard fans of the franchise are also very excited			0
" ' @entity33 ' is the game that all modern ( role - playing games ) flow from , but it 's also kind of the impossible platonic ideal of a ( computer role - playing game ) , " said retro - gamer @entity198 , 31 , of @entity200			1
" it came at this incredibly special time in game development history where that kind of game could exist			0
really , if ' @entity18 ' is one - tenth as engrossing as ' @entity33 , ' then we 'll have a pretty fantastic game that 's worth playing on its own merits			1
" @entity42 said she tried to be respectful while working on this project			0
she understands the history and emotion tied into the franchise and did n't want to override people 's memories of the game			2
" it 's not going to suit everybody , " she said			0
" and in fact , making a game that does suit everybody is going to let the fans down more , in a way			0
it 's the worst possible thing you can do with ' @entity147			0
' i 'd rather try and make a statement than not			0
" players may sign up now to be involved in the " @entity18 " beta test .			1

" @entity18 " challenges players to gain virtue , not hack and slash
the game is a *followup* to 1985 's " @entity33 "
designers say questions in the game have no black - and - white answers
it will be released late this year for @entity186 , @entity176
