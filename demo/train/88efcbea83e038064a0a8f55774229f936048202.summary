and do n't underestimate that power			2
do n't underestimate that transformation , " @entity5 told the crowd friday at the @entity13 convention in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the @entity17 from @entity18 was answering a question about the racial polarization in @entity7			1
@entity5 said " race is still an enormous factor in our society			1
but economics can overcome a lot of racial division			2
" the @entity29 presidential hopeful also said that action , rather than high - minded discussions , is the way to end racial inequality			2
@entity5 said " if we 're doing the right thing and making sure that our young people are going to school , that they 're getting good jobs , that they 're starting businesses , that they 're living in thriving neighborhoods and communities , that will do more to lessen racial tension , division and conflict than any set of roundtables and blue ribbon commissions are going to do			1
" two of @entity5 's main @entity29 rivals , sen. @entity50 , @entity52 - @entity51 , and former sen. @entity53 , @entity52 - @entity54 , also spoke about racial inequality during the @entity13 convention			1
@entity57 told the crowd that she rejects " a conversation about 1.4 million young men as a threat , as a headache , or as a lost cause			2
i reject the conversation about 1.4 million disappointments , failures , and casualties of a broken system			0
that is not who these young men are			0

" rep. @entity94 , @entity95 , also spoke at the @entity13 convention , but no @entity98 candidates came to the presidential forum			0

all of the @entity29 showed up in @entity110 on july 12 for the presidential forum at the @entity113 convention			0
black voters are crucial to the @entity29			1
" nearly nine in 10 blacks vote @entity29 , making them the most reliable @entity29 voting block in the country " said @entity1 pollster @entity115			1
and they 'll play an important role in picking the next @entity29 presidential nominee , especially in @entity121 and @entity122 , two early primary states			0
in @entity1 's most recent polls , @entity57 and @entity5 are running neck and neck among black voters nationally , though @entity57 was well ahead in @entity121			1
