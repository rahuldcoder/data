-- a @entity2 man protesting @entity4 's rule of the region set himself on fire saturday , his death believed to be the first case of self - immolation this year -- but one that adds to a grim , growing toll			1

it was reported by @entity16 , a @entity18 - based organization that campaigns for self - determination for @entity2 , and by the @entity21 - based @entity20			2
@entity16 said the man was 22 , while @entity20 put his age at 19			0
details of the death -- as has been the case with other such incidents -- are sketchy and difficult to verify			2
internet content controlled by local authorities makes reliable information almost impossible to come by			0
self - immolation is a common form of protest for @entity2 , who want genuine autonomy from @entity4 and accuse @entity35 of repression			1
@entity4 began a gradual occupation of @entity16 in the 1950s			2
@entity16 's spiritual leader , the @entity38 , fled for @entity39 in 1959 after a failed uprising , and many ethnic tibetans followed him			0
