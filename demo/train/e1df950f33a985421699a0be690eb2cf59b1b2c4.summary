@entity0 , near @entity3 - @entity2 border -- a low hum rises high into the onion - shaped dome of a village church			1
the priest , shrouded in a gold cape , peers through steel - gray eyes at the small flock standing before him , intoning ancient religious chants			2
a few miles of forest , swampland and rolling potato fields is all that stands between this community of 2,500 people and @entity3 's eastern border with @entity2			1
in the congregation , tears stream down one lady 's face			2
hard to tell whether she 's moved by the power of prayer or whether she 's just plain terrified of the prospect @entity2 troops could invade			1
before he took his vows , father @entity30 -- an engineer by profession -- was an officer in the @entity35 army			1
he came back to this region after the fall of the @entity38 but found no other work except rebuilding churches , including the one in this village			2
he can not believe his old comrades will roll into @entity3 , even less that rank - and - file @entity2 soldiers would heed orders to open fire on their @entity3 neighbors			1
but if they do , @entity30 is preaching to the faithful that there can be no question of turning the other cheek			1
" i will preach to our people to defend our homeland from any invader			1
this is the land of our grandfathers			2
i 'll pray for our army			0
and if they need me i 'm ready to join them to protect our holy land , " he told @entity4			0
' truth is where @entity64 is ' @entity30 knows firsthand the might of the @entity2 military			1
he served the @entity35 at a base in @entity69 between 1986 and 1988 building storage facilities for @entity72 tanks			0
but in his new life as a priest , he believes he and the rest of village have two key tactical advantages against advancing @entity2 armor			1
" we know how to fight a partisan ( guerrilla ) war			2
we know these forests and swamps like the back of our hand and it will be very hard to fight us , " he said			0
truth is where @entity64 is and @entity64 is on our side , " he added			0
@entity91 , who during the week works in the village store , is trying to keep her nerve , hoping and praying for the best			0
" of course i 'm praying for peace			0
but i think the @entity2 will come in , " she said			1
she was at @entity95 with her 3 - year - old grandson @entity96 and her son @entity98			0
@entity99 was a soldier in the @entity3 army and later served in the police force			1
he 's an army reservist , and if war did break out he would almost certainly be dispatched to the front line			0
that thought terrifies his mother			0
" every mother worries when her son is mobilized			0
we understand our young men have to protect the homeland			2
but it 's painful to think that our sons must go to war in the 21st century , " @entity91 said , her voice rising in a mix of fear and defiance			2
this talk of facing down a far more powerful enemy may not be mere bluster			0
the young men of @entity122 know they have the lessons of history to live up to			0
this border region was the scene of a bitter guerrilla campaign during @entity128 @entity3 villagers -- known as " partisans " -- fought in small , lightly armed and highly mobile squads against the @entity132			1
in that era , @entity2 soldiers were their allies			1
in another village near @entity122 , a concrete , wartime monument still stands , emblazoned with a red star and the logo of the @entity35			0
on one side the names of dozens of @entity35 troops who died in combat			2
on the other side , the names of even more @entity3 partisans who fell			1
the locals clearly take pride in that legacy			0
@entity3 military peers intently across border over the past week , @entity155 officials have estimated @entity156 has massed around 40,000 troops on the border and that a further 25,000 are deployed a little deeper in @entity2 's interior			1
the @entity3 government 's @entity161 and @entity160 puts the total figure a little higher -- around 88,000			1
@entity2 foreign minister @entity164 last week said @entity156 had no intention of moving into @entity3			1
however , at the same time , @entity2 president @entity166 has continued to accuse @entity3 nationalists of threatening ethnic @entity2 living in @entity3 -- a pretext he also used to send his troops into the @entity3 region of @entity171			1
@entity173 secretary of state @entity172 met @entity164 sunday for talks in @entity175 about the troop buildup			2
in a press conference afterward , @entity172 said both men had exchanged ideas and suggestions , but there was no hint @entity156 was about to pull its men back			0
far from those diplomatic discussions , in a potato field near @entity122 , a @entity3 military unit has spent days monitoring the border region using a mobile radar station and other sophisticated listening equipment			1
a major , who was not authorized to speak on the record , told us he had seen a huge buildup of @entity2 troop numbers			1
he added they had also spotted attack helicopters , tanks and even missile batteries			0
digging in among the civilian populace , fear is palpable			1
preparations for war are gathering pace			0
on the corner of the square in @entity122 , an abandoned @entity35 - era village store has been reopened			0
a handful of locals turned up sunday bringing supplies of food to donate to @entity3 troop detachments			1
@entity217 , sacks of potatoes , cooking oil and an assortment of home - pickled vegetables were laid out on the ground			0
it 's not clear how many @entity3 troops have been deployed into the border region			1
a few armored personnel carriers and tanks can be seen positioned near strategic points along the highway that leads to the capital , @entity227			0
but many more may be located in the forests			0
villages immediately on the border have been declared closed military zones , according to the @entity3 @entity233			1
outsiders are not being permitted to enter			0
a @entity4 team did briefly manage to get in unhindered			0
in a wooded area just a few hundred yards back from the border , the @entity4 team found a series of recently dug defensive positions , including trenches and foxholes			2
there was no immediate sign of troops			2
a few moments later , a plainclothes border agent arrived and ordered the journalists out of the zone			2
" they 're troublemakers , " he told his men , referring to the journalists			0
but of course , if the @entity2 do roll in , the trouble will only just be beginning .			2
