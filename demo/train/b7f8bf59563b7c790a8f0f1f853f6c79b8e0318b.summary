@entity0 -- first lady @entity2 found herself at the center of an unlikely breast - feeding debate this week when three prominent conservative women criticized her for encouraging the creation of a " nanny state			1
" conservative radio talk show host @entity8 on tuesday asked rep. @entity10 , @entity11 , about an announcement by the @entity13 that the purchase of breast - feeding equipment would be considered a medical expense			1
@entity8 suggested that the first lady 's advocacy of breast - feeding as a way to fight childhood obesity might have been " coordinated " with the @entity13 decision			1
@entity10 , a frequent critic of the @entity2 administration 's policies , was quick to point out that the decision falls in line with the " hard left " agenda			1
" i think this is very consistent with where the hard left is coming from , " @entity10 said			2
" for them , government is the answer to every problem			0
so government got us in this problem , and so they think government is going to get us out of the problem			0
" i 've given birth to five babies and i breast - fed every single one of these babies , and to think that the government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies			0
i mean , you want to talk about the nanny state ? i think you just got a new definition of the nanny			0
" at an event in @entity49 on thursday , @entity47 joined the conversation -- although somewhat lightheartedly			0
" no wonder @entity2 is telling people to breast - feed their babies , because the price of milk is rising so high , " @entity47 joked , later warning reporters , " that better not be the takeaway here			2
" the controversy stems from an @entity13 announcement earlier this month that breast pumps and other breast - feeding supplies would qualify for reimbursement as a medical expense under federal tax law			1
previously , new mothers who set aside pre-tax money in health savings accounts , or who itemized their medical expenses at tax time , were prohibited from filing claims for money spent on breast - feeding equipment			1
as for the question of whether politics played any role in the @entity13 decision , spokespeople for the @entity13 and the @entity81 said the decision was a legal one made by the @entity13 general counsel 's office			0
two days before the @entity13 announcement , @entity2 held a lunch with print reporters to celebrate the first anniversary of her " @entity91 " campaign to fight childhood obesity			2
when asked what plans she had for the campaign 's second year , the first lady said , " breast - feeding			2
kids who are breast - fed longer have a lower tendency to be obese			0
" five months earlier , she used nearly identical language in a speech to the @entity102 ' annual legislative conference			0
" because it 's important to prevent obesity early , we 're also working to promote breast - feeding , especially in the black community , where 40 % of our babies never get breast - fed at all , even in the first weeks of life , " she said in september			1
" and we know that babies that are breast - fed are less likely to be obese as children			2
" while the extent to which breast - feeding affects obesity is still unknown , some connection between the two is largely accepted			1
in 2009 , the @entity118 lobbied the @entity13 directly on the matter because of what it says are the " diverse and compelling advantages for infants , mothers , families and society from breast - feeding and use of human milk for infant feeding			1
" more specifically , the academy 's 2005 policy statement on breast - feeding found that " some studies suggest decreased rates of ... overweight and obesity ... in older children and adults who were breast - fed , compared with individuals who were not breast - fed. " a 2007 report on breast - feeding from @entity142 found that " there is an association between a history of breast - feeding and a reduction in the risk of being overweight or obese in adolescence and adult life , " along with a variety of other health benefits			1
when asked if her problem with the @entity13 decision stemmed from a belief that breast - feeding should n't be in the same category as other medical expenses , @entity10 's office issued a statement that refocused her criticism on the federal tax code			1
" the issue @entity165 have with the tax code is n't with one specific tax deduction , " the statement said			0
" instead of social - engineering through select tax breaks , the government should scrap the current tax code and put all @entity165 on the same playing field			0
" the @entity13 has a fairly broad interpretation of the term " medical expenses " in the federal tax code , including wigs , acupuncture , artificial teeth , eyeglasses , contact lenses , certain home improvements , lead - based paint removal and television equipment for the hearing - impaired as deductible expenses			2
the cost of the @entity13 announcement is hard to estimate			0
although the @entity13 provides broad instructions , individual insurance companies set their own guidelines for what is covered under health savings accounts			0
additionally , only one - third of taxpayers itemize their deductions , and medical expenses need to exceed 7.5 % of income in order to qualify for deduction			2
@entity201 ' @entity200 called the announcement a " regulatory decision " and has not prepared any public information on the issue			0
a 2010 cost analysis of low breast - feeding levels published in the @entity118 ' medical journal @entity118 found that if 90 % of @entity165 families followed medical recommendations to breast - feed for six months , " the @entity165 would save $ 13 billion per year and prevent an excess ( of ) 911 deaths , nearly all of which would be in infants			1

@entity2 promotes breast - feeding as way to limit obesity in children
@entity13 says breast - feeding supplies can be listed as medical expenses
conservative @entity10 links two as " hard left " move to " nanny state "
medical organizations back breast - feeding , support @entity13 move
