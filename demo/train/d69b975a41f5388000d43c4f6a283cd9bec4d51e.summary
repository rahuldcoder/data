-- " are you for @entity2 or for @entity3 ? " @entity5 's boss asked him thursday			1
@entity5 , 35 , from @entity6 , opposes the @entity3 invasion , and the proposed rejoining of @entity9 to @entity3			1
but he carefully said his views are " something in the middle " -- just in case his opinion could affect his job			0
" he says that @entity3 is more rich than @entity2 and we will have stability , " @entity5 said			1
" most of ( the ) people think like that			0
" it 's amazing how normal life continues to appear in some parts of @entity9			1
people still go to work , to restaurants , to bars			0
but tensions continue to mount in the region , where lawmakers voted thursday in favor of rejoining @entity3 and having a referendum in 10 days			1
many people are sincerely grateful for the @entity3 presence , said @entity34 , 24 , who lives in @entity9 and is translating for international radio journalists			1
" i do n't know if they fully realize -- if they know what it means , " @entity34 said of the @entity37 supporters			2
many of them were born in the @entity44 and speak @entity3 , she said			1
as to how they would benefit from @entity9 becoming part of @entity3 , people who support breaking off from @entity2 do n't seem to have answers , she said			1
@entity34 herself is against the @entity3 invasion			1
in the main square in @entity52 , a crowd gathered wednesday in support of @entity3 , waving flags			1
" our grandparents protected our land from the @entity59 , and we will protect our land from @entity62 extremists , " one woman shouted			1
" thank you @entity3 for protecting us			1
" biscuits with @entity9 jam were served up at a pro-russian militia recruitment center , with a portrait of @entity3 president @entity68 watching over			1
@entity69 a @entity3 supporter , told @entity0 's @entity71 that she has been receiving threatening texts from far right elements , and even death threats from @entity75			2
" @entity3 is far more stable , " she said			2
" they have no economic problems , not like here where we have movements like the @entity85 and are in a political and economic mess , " she said , referring to the popular @entity77 street rallies that led to the ouster of @entity2 president @entity79			0
areas around military bases showcase the bubbling tensions			0
wednesday , outside the headquarters of the @entity2 navy in @entity93 , women tried to sneak up to windows and shove food through to the soldiers inside			0
the facility is surrounded by @entity99 civilians who call themselves a " civil defense group , " backed up by masked , armed men in green combat fatigues , presumed to be @entity3 soldiers			2

he thought the @entity99 presence would be even bigger			0
@entity5 does n't mind people expressing their opinion , but the latest string of political developments has him depressed			2
" it 's happening so fast that i am kind of lost and disoriented by all of this , " he said			0
with tourism as a main industry in the city , several hotels are closing their doors , with at least one big hotel firing personnel , @entity5 said			1
" smaller hotels , they just closed because maybe they think there is no hope of having tourists in summer , " he said			0
it 's unclear if they will re-open			0
for now , the region is largely blocked off by troops and vacationers are likely making other plans in the face of obvious tensions			0
@entity5 has not seen any of the presumably @entity3 soldiers in unmarked green uniforms , as his friends have encountered in other cities such as @entity52			1
as a joke , people refer to these troops as " polite armed people , " @entity5 said			2
one of @entity5 's friends brought food to @entity2 soldiers at a military base in @entity167 , near @entity52 , and told @entity5 he was stopped by soldiers about 20 times on the way			2
after answering many questions , he was able to deliver the food through a gate , but could not go inside			0
if @entity9 does become part of @entity3 , as @entity5 suspects it probably will , he will consider leaving the country			1
@entity5 has been studying @entity176 , so @entity176 could be an option , or perhaps elsewhere in @entity178 or the @entity179			2
" if you dislike living in a place ruled by a power you dislike , maybe you should change your life , " @entity5 said			2
