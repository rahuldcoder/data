a @entity3 governor has approved a measure to allow for the relocation of a controversial @entity7 military base on @entity1 , breaking 17 years of stagnation on the base 's transfer plan , the government of @entity1 said friday			1
the @entity1 prefecture 's gov. @entity11 on friday approved a landfill proposal by the @entity3 central government that will permit the construction of new military facilities in a sparsely populated area			1
the @entity18 praised the move			1
" this decision comes after many years of sustained effort between the @entity7 and @entity3 , and it is the most significant milestone achieved in these realignment efforts so far , " defense secretary @entity20 said in a written statement , which the @entity18 initially attributed to rear adm. @entity22 , the @entity18 press secretary , before correcting it			1
" the realignment effort is absolutely critical to the @entity7 ' ongoing rebalance to the @entity28 and our ability to maintain a geographically distributed , operationally resilient , and politically sustainable force posture in the region			2
" the @entity34 air base , which is in a highly populated area , has been unpopular with the island 's residents due to crimes committed by @entity7 military personnel and allegations against them in the past			1
many residents were incensed by the rape of a 12 - year - old @entity3 girl in 1995 by three @entity7 military personnel			1
it sparked some of the worst anti- @entity7 military demonstrations seen in @entity3 in decades			1
in 2002 , a @entity7 staff sergeant in the @entity50 was convicted of raping a @entity3 woman in a parking lot outside a popular nightclub in @entity1			2
intense media coverage of the case brought pressure on the @entity3 government to review its agreement with the @entity7 about handling criminal cases in @entity3 involving the @entity7 military			2
and allegations that a @entity62 raped a 14 - year - old girl caused a furor in 2008			0

about half of all @entity7 military personnel in @entity3 are stationed on the island			1
the stagnation of the relocation issue has been a thorn in the side of relations between @entity78 and @entity79 since 1996 when the two governments agreed on the original plan to move the base			2
@entity11 , the governor , also implied that escalating tension with neighboring countries pushed @entity1 to cooperate with the central government			0
" regardless the will of the @entity1 people , the tension is heightening on ( the ) international front			0
@entity1 needs to play a certain role for that , " he said			0
@entity1 administers the @entity92 , a flash point in a territorial dispute between @entity3 and @entity94			0
