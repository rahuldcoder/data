-- to @entity2 , gifs are a form of visual music			1
" when i started to look at the physics of music , i saw something that is unchanging			1
it 's like you have a unique moment , and it repeats endlessly in the form of musical notes			2
i realized that i could do the same thing in video			1
" the @entity18 digital artist has made a name for himself -- both online and in the gallery circuit -- for his surreal , looping works			1
in keeping with the demands of the art form , @entity2 's videos consist of short , one - to two - second clips looped in an endless run			2
@entity27 features prominently in the backdrop of his work , as does @entity2 himself			1
" the city has really nice scenery and a beautiful light scene			2
i 've decided to use this beautiful scenery as a decoration of some show			2
i 've decided to use it as a set , " he says			2
@entity2 seems to favor theater terms			2
though his audience tends to view his work from their living rooms , he still sees what he does as a public performance , albeit it one in which he plays all the roles			1
though there may be only one of him , he is able to use cloning tools to make more			1
he is also the crew ; he is at once choreographer , director , editor and distributor			0
" you ca n't put on a show in a public space without permission from the municipality			1
if you want a crowd scene , you need too many people			0
with this technique , i have a chance to show choreography to people in any possible place , like @entity71			0
and i just need one person			0
that 's why i use myself -- it 's the easiest way to do it			0
when you clone yourself , you can create an army that will move as you want			0
you do n't need any production or special cameras , " he says			0
his looping selfie army can be slightly comical , but it can also be eerie and haunting , which is precisely the effect he 's going for			0
" sometimes people tell me they find my work spooky or scary			1
to hear that the work makes people feel something is the best comment for me , " he says			1
though his gifs , once looped , contain a mere second or two of footage , it can take @entity2 as much as ten days to film and edit a single piece			0
to make sure he is alone with his city when filming , he usually sets up his camera on a fixed tripod between 3am and 5am			1
" some people are out that time of day , " he concedes			0
" sometimes they wo n't see the camera , because it 's far away , and they 'll just see me streaming nonsense , or running on a spiral path , like a crazy man			0
" @entity2 says he finds comfort in the patterns he 's able to create using just himself , a light source and the background			1
" i create a human pattern			0
i can fill a space with those patterns			1
i have a chance to draw a line with people			0
the repetition makes me personally relaxed , " he says .			0

@entity18 artist @entity114 clones himself on @entity116 to make surreal patterns
he stages public performances in @entity27 when no one is around
