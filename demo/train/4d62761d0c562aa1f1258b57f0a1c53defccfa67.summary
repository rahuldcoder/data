@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has already begun a @entity5 revolution -- now he wants @entity7 football to take over the world			1
the president of high - flying club @entity10 believes playing a @entity12 league game abroad during the regular season could provide huge benefits in the long term , especially if it helps crack the lucrative @entity18 and @entity19 markets			1
the 56 - year - old has been pondering the idea ever since news emerged that the @entity23 was considering playing matches outside the @entity25 in a bid to connect with fans around the world			0
and with @entity12 struggling to match the entertainment of the @entity23 , the @entity29 or @entity31 's @entity30 , @entity3 is keen for @entity7 football to strike back -- although he concedes he may struggle to convince other club owners			1
" i 'd love to take @entity7 football abroad , " @entity3 told @entity2 in an exclusive interview thursday			1
" i do n't know how it would work with @entity12 with the home games , and you 'd have to figure that out , but i 'd love to play a bunch of games abroad or in @entity41			0
" i 'm not saying what form it should take , but we 'd be willing to listen about playing a game in some place			0
" i do n't know it it would be a 39th game or part of the 38 games , but i do n't think it 's a bad idea to get your product out there			0
" in 2011 , @entity10 became the first @entity12 club to be bought by foreign owners -- a @entity18 consortium led by @entity59 , a partner in the @entity60 that also owns @entity1 club @entity61 and baseball 's @entity62			1
@entity3 was one of the new investors , and succeeded @entity59 as president the following year			2
the club has not won the @entity12 scudetto since 2001 , but was runner - up last season			2
that success has continued this season , with @entity10 second in @entity12 after five victories from six games and in a good position to qualify from the group stage of the @entity77			2
a preseason tour to the @entity18 helped underline @entity10 's new commercial pulling power across @entity18 but it is in @entity19 where @entity3 has been pleasantly surprised			1
the club has organized a reality tv series with a @entity85 company in which a group of children undergoes trials and plays matches before being picked to travel to @entity7 and train with @entity10 's youth team			1
@entity7 already has a presence in @entity85 , with the preseason @entity92 being played in @entity94 in 2009 , 2011 - 12			2
" we 're looking worldwide because that 's where our fans are , " @entity3 said of the club 's marketing strategy			0
" we sent our youth team to @entity101 this past year and 25,000 people turned up to see them			0
" can you imagine what would have happened if we 'd sent ( veteran club legend ) @entity105 ? " the @entity18 is clearly important to us , @entity19 is huge for us			1
we have an enormous amount of fans in @entity108 -- we do n't know why yet but we 're trying to learn			0
" in terms of @entity110 , @entity108 was our second biggest market			0
