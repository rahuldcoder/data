-- environmentalists are encouraged by president @entity3 's focus this week on renewable energy and stricter emissions standards , although some economists are skeptical he can pull the country out of the recession while cleaning up the planet			1
president @entity3 with transportation secretary @entity10 and epa administrator @entity11			1
@entity3 must strike a careful balance between stimulating the economy in the coming months and investing in the long - term future of the environment , said @entity16 , professor of economics at the @entity18			1
" if you spend money too quickly , you lose site of the long - term vision , " @entity16 told @entity0			0
" if you focus too much on the long term , you may not act on spending money			2
" framing his remarks with an eye on the recession , the president on monday announced a plan for " a new energy economy that will build millions of jobs			1
" @entity3 proposes to put 460,000 @entity32 to work through clean energy investments , increasing fuel efficiency in vehicles and reducing greenhouse gas emissions			1
by 2025 , the @entity3 administration hopes one - fourth of the nation 's energy will come from renewable sources			1
over the long term , the president hopes to create millions of new jobs by investing $ 150 billion in taxpayer money to help private companies develop new sources of clean energy , such as wind , solar and geothermal power			1
it 's about time , say scientists who often clashed with former president @entity52 on environmental policy			1
" by repowering our nation with clean energy , we will create millions of jobs that ca n't be sent overseas			1
by harnessing the energy of the sun and wind , we can refuel our nation and end our addiction to oil , " said @entity55 , director of programs for the @entity56			2
environmental scholars , however , say the changes @entity3 seeks are not easy			2
" these technologies are not new			0
they have been around for 10 to 15 years , " said @entity65 , dean of the @entity66 at @entity67			0
" @entity69 can push new policies , but it has to prove to be economically competitive or else it will not happen			1
" " it is going to require massive investments , " said @entity72 , former acting assistant secretary of energy under the @entity74 administration and senior fellow at the @entity76			2
" the only question is , are we going to be the leader and export our technologies or a follower and continue importing our resources ? " some economists question whether spending government money on new energy technologies is the best way to stimulate the economy in the short term			1
opponents of @entity3 's proposals say renewable energy would be expensive , take up large amounts of land , and might not even be able to generate sufficient energy given the aging infrastructure of the nation 's electric grid			1
" if the private sector will not invest in these technologies , it will not be efficient , " said @entity100 , senior fellow at the @entity101			0
" creating jobs by switching from one form of energy to another is a bad idea , " he added			2
" you do n't need subsidies for anything that is free			0
getting a $ 7,000 rebate on a $ 100,000 plug - in electrical hybrid that gets its power from a coal plant does n't make a lot of sense			0

" in fact , the solutions to the climate crisis are the same solutions that will address our economic and national crisis as well			0
" @entity3 may have science on his side			2
by overwhelming consensus , scientists agree that our warming planet poses a greater global threat with every passing day			0
the replacement of current technology with energy generated from natural resources , such as sunlight and wind , could help reduce co2 emissions by 50 percent by 2050 , according to the @entity160			0
" frankly the science is screaming at us , " said sen. @entity161 , chairman of the @entity133 , at wednesday 's hearing			0
" carbon dioxide emissions grew at a rate of four times faster in the @entity52 administration than they did in the 1990s			0
" even so , experts agree the faltering economy will complicate any discussion about investment in clean energy			2
" the country is running two deficits , " said @entity173 , a professor of environmental studies and politics at @entity176 , " the economy in the short term , which will take one to five years to figure out [ and ] the environment in the long term , which if we do n't do anything about it will see catastrophic effects			0
