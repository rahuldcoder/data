-- @entity1 says it would be " spectacular " if his new @entity4 team were able to compete when the 2013 @entity6 season begins in march , but the 2008 world champion is not expecting to challenge at the front of the grid			1
@entity1 ended a career - long association with @entity11 to sign a three - year deal with @entity4 in september			1
despite competing for race wins in each of his six seasons with @entity11 , the @entity13 accepts that his new team are some way behind the pace set by his former employers and @entity20 and @entity21			1
" i think it 's important to be patient and realistic , " the 28 - year - old was quoted as saying on @entity6 's official website			1
" you 've got to remember that the way @entity6 has gone over the years , with the car evolving each year and how long it takes to find one second throughout the season			1
" @entity4 were 1.1 seconds behind in @entity30 ... it 's going to be very difficult for them in three months to gain two seconds			1
so i 've just got to be wary of that , but i know that the guys are working as hard as they can and every little bit counts			0
" this is a marathon , not a sprint			0
it 's looking like the long haul			2
i hope that this year that we can be competitive			2
if we arrive at the first race and we are at the front it 's going to be spectacular , but if we 're not , then we just have to keep on working at it			2
" @entity1 endured a frustrating 2012 campaign with five race retirements denting his title challenge , eventually having to settle for a fourth - place finish in the drivers ' championship			1
the @entity13 is willing to display similar patience with his new team			0
" you 've got to remember i had a couple of half - dodgy cars in the past , one in particular in 2009 , but it did get better , " he continued			2
" @entity56 is going to be key for all of us			0
" there is a great spirit -- just as there was in my previous team -- and the guys seem hungrier than any group of people i 've seen before			0
they seem seriously hungry to win and excited that they have another shot of it again this year			2
" @entity1 is looking forward to getting behind the wheel of his new car during preseason testing in @entity71 , @entity72 next month , before making his grand prix debut in @entity74 in march			1
" hopefully in those first days i 'll have quite a good impact because i 'll be able to compare one car to the other and say what we do and do n't have , " he said			0
" i 'll be able to say how the car is and how it could be better			0
but it 'll take some time to dial in and get up to speed because they 've got different controls on the steering wheel , different settings , a different set - up , and different characteristics of aero balance			0
" i do n't know how long it 'll take for me to dial those in but i 'm on top of it and i 'm ready to get going			0

@entity1 is not expecting @entity4 to challenge immediately
@entity1 left @entity11 to join @entity4 on a three - year deal
the 2008 world champion finished fourth in last year 's drivers ' championship
@entity1 will make his @entity4 debut at the @entity74 @entity102 in march
