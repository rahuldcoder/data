@entity0 -- the past week in @entity0 has been like living in a disaster movie			1
" escape from @entity12 " would have been an apt title on monday as we broadcast live from the center of the riots , which saw gangs of several hundred young men and women looting shops , terrorizing by - standers and mugging news crews			1
we arrived on @entity13 in the early evening to find a scene of anarchy			1
the police were outnumbered and only able to hold a small side road while the mob -- emboldened by the lack of arrests -- controlled the main highway			1
our crew was equipped for a war zone -- perhaps an overreaction in hindsight , but during those febrile hours , gunfire did n't seem impossible			1
thugs in balaclavas patrolled the streets , menacing anyone that they saw as they helped themselves to televisions , alcohol and cash from local businesses			1
as we beamed the pictures around the world , we too were targeted -- bottles and bricks thrown at us in an attempt to drive us back			1
one journalist approached , breathlessly warning us his video camera had just been snatched by a group of about 10 young men			1
we soon realized the presence of the police nearby was n't enough to stop us being targeted			1
as we walked back from a supermarket that we 'd filmed being looted and then " re-taken " by police dog handlers , we were accosted by more criminals			2
these men , women and children were high on the intoxicating sense of anarchy that had turned a once bustling shopping area into a no - go zone			2
in a matter of hours they 'd completely lost all fear of arrest -- it was clear to see that the looters now were in control and , for a few hours , could do anything they wanted			1
it sounds ridiculous , but i was as scared in @entity12 as i 've ever been in @entity67 , @entity68 or the @entity69			1
the crowds were skittish and moved in packs			2
every so often , without warning or apparent pretext , there would be a panicked stampede			2
hooded kids would run down the road as if fleeing from other looters			1
after several hours the police managed to re-establish order in @entity12 , but by then the genie was out of the bottle			1
copycat gangs were on the rampage elsewhere			2
we drove north into central @entity0 , seeing shops smashed on @entity87 , and then into @entity88 -- the bohemia of cool -- suddenly awash with gangs of masked teenagers without a policeman in sight			2
then reports came in of trouble in @entity97 -- a leafy suburb to the west			2
as we drove the radio relayed eyewitness accounts of fires burning out of control across @entity0 and beyond			2
we arrived in @entity97 to find a car abandoned in the street , its windshield smashed , as if it had been attacked while traveling along the road			2
i shuddered to think what happened to its occupants			2
it did n't take a great leap of imagination to empathize with terrified local residents ; i used to live not far from here -- and have friends who still do			0
nearby , a parade of shops was smashed , bins set alight			0
further on , we found burning cars , ominous sentinels marking the fault - line between " turf " held by the gangs and the relative sanctuary of streets controlled by the police			1
the fire brigade and police watched the vehicles burn , but made no attempt to extinguish them , apparently for fear of being attacked			1
i do n't blame them -- the risk was very real			0
amid all this chaos though , there were signs of civility			0
i met a man , @entity142 , who 'd rescued a bus driver from a gang of vandals			0
the bus remained abandoned in the street , windows smashed , interior charred , wipers -- bent 90 degrees -- still occasionally moving in unison			0
the driver , @entity155 , spoke of the horrifying moment he saw the gang was coming for him , his bus boxed in by traffic and unable to move			0
he was unhurt , but profoundly traumatized by what had happened , thankful of the kind actions of a stranger who helped him to the safety			0
the feeling of depression and fear about what we 'd seen was vivid			0
it felt like @entity171 society was collapsing			1
i wondered how on earth order would be restored and realized how fragile civilized law and order can be			0
in one night , it seemed we 'd collectively lurched towards a precipice -- a small minority of idiots had hijacked the country			0
by tuesday in @entity0 it was clear that sheer numbers of police were needed			0
the officers faced down the gangs with " robust " action -- as the prime minister @entity187 had called for			0
we watched in @entity189 as youths , some mere children , were arrested for the slightest infraction			1
anyone who looked suspicious was stopped , searched and detained if there was resistance or " back - chat			0
" and there was a new weapon against the mob -- the public			0
@entity200 - up with the spreading chaos , communities were taking on the role of the police , groups of men protecting businesses , mosques , temples and cafes in different parts of the city , applauding the police as they sped past to the latest flash - point			0
elsewhere in @entity171 , though , the mayhem was just starting -- the great industrial cities of the midlands and the north were now facing the same destruction and looting quashed in @entity0			1
we traveled to @entity221 , where three young @entity171 @entity223 men had been mowed down by a car and killed while trying to protect a local garage			1
reports from @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 re-enforced that this was now a nationwide phenomenon			0
and then as suddenly as it started , it stopped			0
the invisible momentum which had propelled the gangs evaporated			0
perhaps idle parents suddenly took their offspring in hand , perhaps the " game " of destruction had become boring , perhaps the police were too visible and numerous , perhaps the community vigilantes too threatening			0
the debate about why it happened is already in full swing -- all i know is that , like millions of other @entity171 , i am relieved that it appears to be over and hope we never stare into the abyss of anarchy again .			1

for five nights , @entity1 and the world watched as riots spread across @entity171 cities
@entity1 *'s* @entity255 and crew became targets of attackers as the violence spread
looters roamed the streets , emboldened by lack of arrests as hours wore on
' i was as scared in @entity12 as i 've ever been in @entity67 , @entity68 or the @entity69 '
