@entity0 , @entity1 -- if the first episode of " @entity5 " focused on pressure the @entity7 , @entity8 and emerging economies heaped on @entity1 for artificially keeping the value of its yuan low , the sequel could be called : " currency wars : the @entity13 strikes back			1
" at least that is how it 's playing abroad			0
at the @entity20 summit in @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23 meet in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity7 president @entity16 finds himself on the defensive after the @entity13 's decision last week to pump $ 600 billion into the economy			1
that was brought into sharp focus thursday when @entity30 president @entity29 , host of the @entity20 , was asked at a press conference about the impact of the @entity13 's decision			0
" i think that kind of question should be asked to me when president @entity16 is not standing right next to me , " he joked			0
the @entity13 move was the latest volley in the topsy - turvy trade among global currencies			1
the euro started the year at $ 1.44 , did a mid-year swan dive to $ 1.19 , and is now back to $ 1.38			0
the @entity44 hit parity with the @entity7 dollar last week for the first time since @entity48 floated the currency in 1983			1
@entity18 's economy was among those hardest hit by the financial crisis , yet the yen is trading at 15 - year record highs			2
@entity56 president @entity55 jumped into the fray on monday , suggesting in a @entity59 commentary a limited return to the gold standard to provide stability to the markets			0
by wednesday , he had backpedaled on that statement			0
so what 's going on ? analysts say there is a sea change happening in the balance of world wealth in the wake of the financial crisis , churning large waves that are being felt in the currency markets			1
interactive : the new global economy " to me the big subject that is just starting to be talked about now ( is ) ... how does the whole global currency system work ? " said @entity77 , global head of equity strategy for @entity79			1
" the idea of floating currencies and free capital flows and no gold standard , that 's a fairly recent development that only came in 1971 with ( the ) @entity89 doctrine , " @entity77 said			0
" that 's not how the world was run in most of the last 200 years , and that whole area is going to get re-thought			0
" here are the key factors at play this week in the current currency conflict			1
@entity96 = printing greenbacks they do n't call it ' quantitative ' easing for nothing			0
the @entity13 announcement last week to increase the quantity of dollars sloshing through the global economy by $ 600 billion was the second round of quantitative easing since the financial crisis , ( nicknamed ' @entity96 ' )			2
the policy aims to lower interest rates and encourage consumer spending , by pumping more cash into the economy , which the @entity13 hopes will boost @entity7 consumption and generate more jobs			1
the by - product of that move : as more dollars hit the market , the value of the dollar decreases			0
hence the outcry from countries that side with the @entity7 against @entity1 monetary policy , because the @entity13 's move can be seen as a way to artificially lower the value of the dollar			1
" whether that was the intent , the @entity13 certainly knew that would be the outcome , " said @entity127 , chairman of @entity128 and an advisor to several @entity20 government boards			0
more dollars + emerging economies = bad ? @entity96 also means emerging economies are bracing for an influx of dollars , and taking measures to guard against it			0
why is the money headed to emerging markets , and why are developing nations worried about it ? the money will inevitably flow into emerging economies like @entity145 and @entity146 because they have the largest growth rate , therefore the largest possible return on investment			2
world underdogs take the lead " if it was 1997 , they would say , ` @entity159 ! ' " to the large influx of dollars , said @entity153 , director of the @entity154 in @entity155 , @entity156			0
in 1997 , developing economies in @entity162 were being battered by the @entity163			0
" but right now they have enough capital , have enough employment			0
moreover , when the capital arrives , the exchange rate ( of the local currency ) will strengthen , " @entity153 said			2
" one thing ( emerging economies ) have learned from the @entity1 : sustainable , high growth rates requires you to export a lot			2
" if the local currency goes up against the @entity7 dollar , the export industry will be hurt			1
that 's why countries from @entity146 to @entity145 have implemented new controls to slow the influx of cash expected from @entity96			0
the blank check of the @entity7 the @entity7 economy has an incredible fringe benefit it alone enjoys : the @entity7 dollar is the reserve currency of choice among foreign nations			1
@entity1 alone sits on $ 2.7 trillion in its foreign currency reserves			1
" it 's like writing a check that nobody cashes , " @entity127 said			0
" other countries say , ` i like this check , i 'm keeping it , one day i may need to cash it ' , " @entity127 said			0
" but your bank account remains the same , so what do you do ? you keep on writing checks			0
" being the reserve foreign currency of the world allows the @entity7 to borrow money at very low interest			1
this also presents a problem for the @entity7 -- it makes erasing its trade imbalance impossible , analysts say			1
" i 'm slightly oversimplifying it , but by definition , the @entity7 has to export more than it imports , " said @entity77 of @entity79			2
" something like 70 percent of global reserves are in @entity7 dollars			1
that means all those countries need to export more than they import to the @entity7 , because they need to put all those dollars in their reserves			2
" @entity1 's force field there has been a lot of pressure placed on @entity1 regarding its peg to the @entity7 dollar --- meaning it only allows the currency to appreciate in small doses relative to the dollar			1
critics argue that places an unfair advantage that keeps the price of @entity1 products artificially low			2
@entity1 quit allowing its currency to appreciate after the financial crisis in 2008 , but it began to move again in june --- although only rising about 2 percent			1
critics argue it should be 30 percent higher or more			0
what is currency manipulation , anyhow ? but another factor has shielded the @entity1 monetary system			1
whereas @entity7 dollars are stacked as reserves in nations around the world , the @entity1 yuan is not allowed to leave @entity1 through use of capital controls			1
" if you 're not a @entity1 resident , you 're not allowed to buy yuan , yuan bonds or have a @entity1 bank account , " @entity153 said			2
" it 's the only major economy with capital controls			1
" that allows @entity1 to have tight control on the value of its currency			1
what 's next ? the @entity7 came to @entity21 with the hopes of setting hard targets for trade deficits and trade surpluses that would , in turn , limit when nations can allow their currency to appreciate or depreciate			1
so far , that looks unlikely			0
the strongest opposition against setting targets has come not from @entity1 , but the @entity8 , especially @entity267 , said @entity268 , a fellow at the @entity269			2
" fiddling around with exchange rates is papering over the real problems , " said @entity127 , who used to be a currency trader			0
for @entity1 , the larger issue is switching over from an export - led economy to a domestically driven one			1
for the @entity7 , it 's jumpstarting growth and scaling back its growing national debt			2
the direction of these two macroeconomic trends , analysts say , will determine the future skirmishes or peace on the currency battlefield			0
" in the long run , @entity1 needs to have an open financial system , " @entity268 said			2
" my fear is that the 21st century will be for @entity7 what the 20th century was like for @entity289 , when the pound was the world 's largest reserve currency , " @entity127 said			1
" losing it is hell , because all those checks you 've written ? people start cashing them			0

a sea change in global wealth is churning waves in currency markets
@entity7 and @entity1 monetary policy are the key factors in ' currency wars '
as a global reserve currency , the @entity7 dollar also *perpetuates* trade imbalances
@entity1 is the only major economy that restricts its currency flow through capital controls
