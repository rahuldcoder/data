-- @entity1 has a smile on his face again , and it is all to do with a new love in his life -- golf			1
after reams of column inches devoted to his split with @entity13 © e @entity11 , the two - time major champion has decided to go back to basics in order to fill the void			1
as he heads for the third major of the year -- the @entity18 in @entity19 that begins thursday -- he 's been busy stalking the links courses of his native @entity21 and rekindling his passion for the game			1
" i 've sort of fallen in love with golf again , " the current world no. 8 told @entity0 's @entity26 show			1
" i 'm a golfer first and foremost and the last month or so i 've really buried my head in my golf game			2
" @entity26 is my first passion and my first love and it 's great to be able to spend days playing and remember where you started again , remembering those rounds at @entity38 , " he added referring to his local club in @entity21			1
" just remembering the love and the joy you have for the game			2
i feel like i 've found that out these last few weeks			0
" the 25 - year - old 's decision to call off his planned wedding to @entity46 tennis star @entity11 predictably sparked a maelstrom in the press			1
two high profile sporting stars , known the world over , ending their engagement just days after wedding invitations had been issued became headline news			0
a bereft looking @entity1 fronted up at @entity54 ahead of the @entity55 in may merely hours after the news broke , and promptly won the @entity58 's flagship event			1
that triumph represented his first big win on @entity62 soil , his other victories on the tour coming either in the @entity65 or @entity66			0
the 2011 @entity67 and 2012 @entity69 pga champion spoke of the " sanctuary " the course offered away from all the questions about his state of mind and emotional well - being			2
and a large chunk of his time since has been spent honing his game on the links courses of his homeland in preparation for his assault on another prestigious crown -- the @entity18			1
despite being brought up on courses similar to the one he 'll try to tame at @entity87 in the 143rd incarnation of golf 's oldest major , @entity1 has struggled to make an impression since 2010			1
but that is something he is determined to change this time around			2
" i feel like my record in the @entity18 has n't been great , " he explained			1
" it 's important to prepare to play links golf , to know the course as much as you can			1
" i finished third at @entity99 's in 2010 but apart from that i have n't done much			1
i want to really put all i can into it and try and compete this year			0
" i do n't want to curse my luck but it was incredibly windy on the friday afternoon ( at @entity99 's , where @entity1 followed up his opening round of 63 with a second round 80 )			1
" it was my first time leading a major after the first round and i did n't really handle it that well but i came back well and at the weekend i shot a couple of rounds in the 60s			1
as well as @entity38 , @entity1 has spent time honing his game at @entity113 and @entity114 in @entity21			1
" i 've been getting as much practice around the greens because that 's where you have a lot of variety and play shots you normally do n't play on tour , " he said			2
" @entity123 and @entity21 have some of the best links courses in the world so to not take advantage of that would be a shame			0
" after that third place finish in 2010 , @entity1 's form at @entity18 has lurched ever further backwards			1
he finished 25th at @entity131 's in 2011 , as compatriot @entity132 lifted the @entity133 , then 60th at @entity134 the following year			0
last time out , at @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity1 endured a miserable start , shooting 79 on the opening day and describing himself as " brain dead " in a typically frank press conference immediately after			1
it was one of the low points in a slump that saw him relinquish the world no. 1 ranking and fend off persistent questions as to whether his equipment deal with @entity148 had disrupted his game			0
and though he missed the cut after a round of 75 on the second day , he took some valuable lessons from his playing partner on the opening two days , and eventual winner , @entity155			0
" i played with @entity155 for two rounds at @entity135 last year and i was really impressed with the way he controlled his ball flight , " @entity1 said			1
" he was bouncing balls into the green , getting the ball on the ground as soon as possible and i feel that 's something i need to do more of			0
" back when i was an amateur i was used to playing links golf much more so you are much more comfortable playing those shots			0
" now as a pro most weeks you 're playing everything through the air and trying to adapt your game for these two weeks a year			0
" that 's why i 'm going to try and practice those shots so when the time comes i 'm comfortable with them			1
" @entity1 does have some memories of the course at @entity180 , having played there as a teenager , but they ca n't be classed as fond ones			2
" i actually played at @entity180 in 2003 in the @entity184 boys as a 14 - year - old and got beaten in the first round , " he said			0
" that was the first and last time i have played the course			0
it 's quite a flat golf course			2
i like the bunkering -- the faces look at you off the tee so you have a good visualization and good definition of where you need to hit the ball round there			0
" i remember watching @entity18 in 2006 and how hot and burnt it was , @entity198 ( @entity199 ) taking an iron off every tee and going on to win			2
" i 'm looking forward to seeing it again			0
i think it 's a course from what i remember should set up pretty well for me depending on the conditions			0
" as he rekindles his love for golf , another important relationship in @entity1 's personal life has also deepened			1
he and @entity210 -- the greatest golfer of all time with 18 majors to his name -- are neighbors in @entity215 , and @entity1 is a member at the 74 - year - old 's @entity216			1
and that means @entity1 has the ear of one of the most important opinions in the game			2
" @entity210 has always been so generous with his time , we 've formed quite a nice friendship over the last few years , " he explained			0
" being a member of his club in @entity228 we 've talked a lot			0
most of the time it 's about golf and how to handle certain situations			1
the ( most recent ) meeting was how he manages his time			2
" all the things he had to manage on the course and still dedicate himself to his game			0
finding a balance in life in a way			0
" it 's always nice to spend some time with him , if nothing else it inspires you to go out and be better , practice and be a better player			2
" i think he gets me and i do too			0
a lot of the things he says really make sense			0
