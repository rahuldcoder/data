its sponsor , @entity19 @entity18 rep. @entity17 , said the bill would clear up questions such as those raised by last month 's @entity24 shootings involving contractors from the @entity7 security firm @entity14			1
@entity17 introduced the measure in january , and the @entity27 approved the bill in august			1
the @entity29 was expected to begin debate on the bill wednesday afternoon , with a vote tentatively scheduled thursday morning			1
but the @entity35 , in a formal statement of policy , said the measure would overburden the military , overstretch the @entity37 , intrude on prosecutorial decisions and extend federal jurisdiction overseas in ways that would be " impossible or unwise			1
" " the administration welcomes the opportunity to discuss these important issues further with @entity45 , " the statement said			0
the bill would state that contractors working for the @entity7 government overseas are subject to the @entity49 , which allows @entity7 courts to prosecute crimes committed in a war zone overseas			1
the act covers contractors " supporting the mission of the @entity56			0

wednesday , @entity17 released a statement calling the @entity3 administration 's objections unfounded			1
the @entity35 position " should infuriate anyone who believes in the rule of law , " the statement read			2

the @entity35 said the bill would saddle the @entity37 with the responsibility of investigating deaths caused by private contractors overseas			1
it would place " inappropriate and unwarranted burdens " on the @entity56 , which the administration said would be required to arrest contractors and support a specially created @entity37 unit that would investigate killings in a theater of war			2
" the administration is concerned that this sweeping expansion of extraterritorial jurisdiction would create federal jurisdiction overseas in situations where it would be impossible or unwise to extend it , " the @entity35 said			1
" the bill would have unintended and intolerable consequences for crucial and necessary national security activities and operations			1
