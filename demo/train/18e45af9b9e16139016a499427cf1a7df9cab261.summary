there was a time when there was nothing like @entity5 on television			1
@entity5 was the guy who dropped bowling balls and watermelons from the roof of a tall building			1
@entity5 was the guy who had a writer come on to read , straight - faced , from " @entity12			1
" @entity5 was the guy who let his stage manager recap " @entity14 , " let two @entity16 gift - store owners named @entity17 and @entity18 serve as " roving correspondents " and always -- @entity20 -- bit the network hand that fed him			1
( or , perhaps , gave the " @entity24 handshake " to his corporate bosses			0
) he took elements of @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , ran them through his own skewed perspective and came up with something new : the anti-talk show			0
this week 33 years ago -- february 1 , 1982 , to be precise -- " @entity34 with @entity5 " made its debut			1
the first guest ? @entity37			0
the talk show host announced in april that he was stepping down from " @entity34 's " @entity40 successor , " the @entity41 with @entity5 , " in 2015			1
@entity5 's final show will be may 20			1
' do our own thing ' if you were a celebrity who came on " @entity34 " ( his 1980s @entity48 show ) or " @entity41 " ( his @entity40 successor ) simply to chat about your new movie or album or tv show , good luck to you			0
@entity5 -- he was always " @entity5 " -- might be interested , but more likely he was bored or cranky			1
he much preferred the @entity55 or @entity56 of the world who would use their spot to do something silly			0
it was a comedic style that never really captured @entity63 -- for most of their 20 - year rivalry , @entity61 's ratings were much higher than @entity5 's -- but influenced a generation of comedians and comedy writers			1
" @entity69 , " @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , any comedian or comedy that used irony , silliness , absurdity and a little bit of antagonism as their stock in trade -- @entity5 made network television , previously an irony - free zone , safe for all of them			1
( there was more than a little @entity5 in @entity87 's curdled , insecure faux talk - show host , @entity88			1
) " he did the thing that everyone 's tried to do since and has never done , which is to take the talk - show form and redo it , " @entity89 , an early @entity5 guest , told @entity90 in 2011			1
" the mindset was , ' we 're tired of pretending there are no cue cards and no cameras and nothing 's rehearsed			2
it 's late , and we 're going to take over this little piece of territory and do our own thing			2
' now that mindset is everywhere			0
" reveling in friction at its best , @entity5 's late - night show was unpredictable , particularly in the 1980s , when it was all new			1
he once used pictures from an old @entity111 catalog over the opening credits			0
he did a " 360 - degree show , " letting the camera rotate all the way around during the course of the hour			2
( at the half - hour mark , @entity5 was upside - down			1
) his interviews -- the " talk " of talk shows -- were often deliberately devoid of content			2
sometimes he used his guests for comedy bits , as when @entity124 , allegedly on the set to promote a movie , deplored @entity5 's questions and then had the @entity129 launch into a gospel song about himself			1
other times they were , shall we say , antagonistic			0
perhaps the most famous example was an appearance by actor @entity135 ( " @entity136 " ) in 1987			0
at one point , @entity135 got up to demonstrate a roundhouse kick			0
@entity5 went to a commercial break			2
when he returned , @entity135 was gone			0
of course , @entity5 reveled in friction			2
both @entity141 and @entity142 had tetchy interviews with the host			0
he made much of an alleged feud with @entity146			0
during the " @entity34 " days , he booked people like @entity148 or " @entity149 " cartoonist @entity150 : types who were the very antithesis of talk - show guests , types who made audiences uncomfortable			2
@entity5 grew up a bit when he went to @entity40 in 1993			2
with @entity48 , he wore blazers and sneakers , very much the impish college boy			0
suddenly he was in nice suits and shined shoes			0
the guests became more of the a-list variety , though @entity5 was still the type to make room for a musician like @entity167 , a personal favorite who would never have passed muster on @entity61 's " tonight			1
" but it probably says something that @entity5 's most striking moments of recent years came when he dropped the ironic pose and spoke from the heart			1
these moments -- paying tribute to mentor @entity28 , thanking his heart surgeons , talking about his son , confessing to an affair -- made the very private host seem a little more approachable			0
given some of the stories about @entity5 's self - loathing that his former partner and onetime head writer , @entity186 , has told over the years , he probably hated that			1
who shall be the heir ? perhaps all that irony does n't make sense anymore			0
with @entity193 's takeover of the " @entity194 , " commentators have been making much of a " return to earnestness , " playing up @entity198 's niceness and wide - eyed wonder			2
@entity198 himself has named @entity26 as a model , not so much @entity5			2
( @entity71 would never have said that			0
) and there 's something a little awkward about @entity5 , the @entity205 , still presiding over his anti-talk show circus at the age of 67			1
( he turns 68 in april			0
) it 's not that he ca n't pull it off ; it 's that he 's been doing it for so long that his original college student audience now has children ( and grandchildren ! ) of their own			0
they have so many more options , and @entity5 is now one of many			2
@entity218 , who created his own kind of looking - glass show , will take over this year			1
no doubt he 'll bring his own absurdity to the role			0
but nobody will replace @entity5			1
that was obvious 33 years ago .			0

@entity5 's comedic style has always been different
his late - night shows were often unpredictable
@entity218 will replace him this year
