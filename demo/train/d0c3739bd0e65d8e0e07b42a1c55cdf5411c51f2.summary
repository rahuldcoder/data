-- @entity1 ca n't get enough of @entity3			1
the @entity5 - winning director recently completed " @entity6 , " his third feature - length documentary on the iconic folk - rocker , which mingles footage of @entity3 alone onstage at @entity11 's @entity10 with moving scenes of him driving through his childhood home of @entity15 , @entity16			1
it opens on friday , june 29 , in @entity18 and @entity19 , then rolls out across the country all summer			1
@entity1 is the acclaimed director of a long list of dramatic films , including 1991 's horrific " @entity23 " and 2008 's " @entity24 " -- but music is never far from his mind			1
he collaborated with @entity28 on the classic @entity27 concert film , " @entity36 , " in 1984 , and music is a crucial part of his dramatic movies , including 1993 's " @entity33 , " which features deeply emotional original songs from @entity3 and @entity35			1
in 1995 , @entity1 and @entity3 followed their " @entity33 " collaboration with " @entity39 , " a five - song short film with @entity41			1
between 2006 's " @entity43 , " 2009 's " @entity44 " and now , " journeys , " they 've completed a trilogy of feature - length films that capture different phases of @entity3 's work			1
@entity1 , who just finished shooting an adaptation of @entity54 's " @entity53 " with @entity55 and @entity56 ( " @entity57 " ) , spoke to @entity0 about his love of music , @entity3 's film director alter - ego @entity3 and his long journey through the past with @entity3			1
@entity0 : when did you first become aware of @entity3 and his music ? @entity1 : in the @entity62 , when @entity63 came out			1
like most young people , i was very engaged with contemporary music , especially because of the @entity67 , which made everybody listen that much closer to everything			1
it was such a thrilling moment in popular music			1
and now , here 's @entity63 , and they 're great			1
and there 's one particular individual in there -- he was n't singing too many of the songs , but he was writing these amazing songs , singing a little bit			1
i remember the @entity3 brand hitting me very hard immediately			1
he was n't an acquired taste			1
@entity0 : @entity63 broke up pretty fast			2
@entity1 : they only put out three albums			1
i kind of despaired a little bit : " oh , what , no more @entity63 ? " then , bam , here comes the solo album , which was so amazing			2
i was a rock critic at that point			2
i lived in @entity88 and was a writer for a @entity91 - based alternative newspaper called @entity92			1
i reviewed @entity93 at the @entity94 in ' 69			2
i read that [ review ] fairly recently , and i was very turned off by @entity95 talking too much , but then i was very turned on by @entity3			1
@entity0 : it seems like the last 20 years of his career are the most documented ones			2
journeys is your third feature - length film with him			1
@entity1 : the first one we did , " @entity43 , " really turned out well , and we got to know each other aesthetically and personally quite well			1
" @entity108 " was not conceived as a movie			2
he had a great tour going , great lighting , great set , great song list , great band			2
that 's a concert film			2
i do n't think " journeys " is a concert film -- it 's a performance film with a strong documentary component to it			1
a couple of years later , he 's touring with the [ " @entity124 " ] show			2
i was struck immediately by the magnitude of the sound in the context of one man , this grizzled maestro with electric guitars and other things , filling up these halls with this amazing music			2
and i thought , " there 's never been a performance film like that before			2
" so it became an opportunity to do something completely different from what we 'd done before			2
and maybe we can add this other travel dimension to it			2
he 's a great artist , a great entertainer , and endlessly desirable to see and hear			2
@entity0 : are you a fan of @entity3 's work as a filmmaker ? @entity1 : i have a lot of respect for @entity3			1
it 's a wonderful @entity154 independent movie			2
when @entity28 and i were getting ready to do " @entity36 , " we were looking at concert films and trying to figure out how we could do a film that was different from all the rest , and also would be really good			0
for @entity28 , " @entity160 " was the one he wanted to be as good as			0
@entity0 : you do a lot of driving with @entity3 in " journeys			0
" how is he behind the wheel ? @entity1 : he 's good			1
i do n't know if you 've driven a pre-power steering car lately , but those things are hard , man			0
they 're physically demanding , and they do n't respond really well			0
we started in little towns with serene back roads			0
we wound up on the freeway , and what was cute and charming in a @entity177 back in @entity15 , now becomes this bizarre relic amidst a stream of modern speeding cars			0
it wound up kind of poignant			0
i never thought i 'd say to myself , " oh , poor @entity3			0
" by the time he 's in downtown @entity11 in his charming old car , he looked really vulnerable			0
@entity0 : for anyone who has listened to @entity3 's music , to actually see the " town in @entity16 " that he sings about in " helpless " was fascinating			0
@entity1 : i know ! whenever you heard that line , did n't you always picture something ? it was very beautiful , whatever it was			1
and it was kind of amazing to get to that town in @entity16 and see , what do you know , it is gorgeous			0
and , amazingly , it 's still here			0
@entity0 : there is also a scene where you go to a childhood home of his , and all that 's left is the lawn			0
@entity1 : yeah , and the symbolism of actually seeing the earthmovers right at work even as he 's driving away			1
it 's almost like , " you better get out of there , @entity3 , before they gobble you up like that old house			0
" @entity0 : how do you explain the powerful connection between film and music ? @entity1 : we 're raised on these two incredible treats			1
we hear music coming over the radio first ; we fall in love with music			0
we see television , and we fall in love with the moving image			0
a music film is what takes these two separate , wonderful experiences and marries them			0
i felt from time to time that shooting live music is the most purely cinematic thing you can do			0
ideally , the cinema is becoming one with the music			0
there is little artifice involved			0
@entity0 : it 's also a big part in your dramatic films , like your use of the song " @entity243 " in " @entity23 , " when the serial killer @entity245 is primping in the mirror			1
@entity1 : that song was n't in the script			1
the first time i heard that song , i was doing the final mix on a " @entity254 " video with @entity253 and [ producer ] @entity255			0
we finished it up , and there was a blizzard going on in @entity18			0
@entity255 and i got in a cab , and after we drop him off , the driver says to me , " are you in the music business ? " " uh , not really			0
" so she puts on " @entity243 " going through a blizzard , and , " @entity265 , what is this and who are you ? " she was an unsigned singer @entity268 , and that song ended up in @entity23			1
and i asked her to sing @entity28 's song " @entity271 " at a party scene in @entity33			0
@entity0 : it added so much depth to the moment			0
@entity1 : music has that potential			1
it can be like something that saves you in a scene that is n't working that great -- the right music can make a weak scene acceptable			0
it can also add a whole other dimension to a scene			0
it can send it right into the ozone			0
