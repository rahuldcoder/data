-- one of the more striking things about holding a new @entity3 model is how your old @entity3 , which seemed perfectly sleek and adequate just an hour earlier , can suddenly feel slow , clunky and heavy			1
it 's a neat trick , one that @entity6 is betting on to help it ship new units to existing @entity3 owners in the coming year			1
after wednesday 's @entity6 media event , we were given some hands - on time with the upgraded @entity3 5 , as well as the @entity13 and @entity15 nano			1
here are our first impressions of the taller , lighter @entity3 , which we tested next to a crusty , practically fossilized @entity17			1
opinion : the @entity3 is not our savior the iphones and ipods were laid out on tables in the dim , windowless hall at the @entity24			1
protective @entity6 employees made sure the devices were n't pilfered , wiped off journalists ' fingerprints and visibly flinched every time someone dropped a phone ( which happened quite a few times while we were there )			0
from the front , the @entity3 looks just like the @entity17 and @entity34			1
it actually takes a moment to register that it 's taller ( holding it next to a previous @entity3 model helps bring it home )			1
the display is the same retina display found in the @entity17 , the @entity34 and now , the new @entity13 but is now 4 inches instead of 3.5 inches			0
then you pick it up			0
the phone is incredibly light , and that weight is its most striking and memorable feature			1
it feels almost delicate in the hand , naked without some sort of protective case to prevent it from snapping in half			0
of course , the @entity3 is not nearly that fragile			1
the body is made out of the same aluminum found in @entity55 , as well as glass			0
it feels expensive , not like a plastic device that could break easily			0
( we look forward to the inevitable drop tests			0
) 2007 : @entity61 unveils the first iphone on their own , thinner and lighter are interesting selling points			0
yes , it feels incredible in the hand , but the @entity17 was n't exactly weighing anyone down , and consumers were n't clamoring for a thinner smartphone			1
on the other hand , @entity6 prides itself on delivering features people will want before they know they want them			0
there has been demand for more screen real estate , and on that front the @entity3 delivers , but it might still not be enough for those hoping for a 4.5 - inch screen , which is found on many @entity82 devices			1
the new @entity3 has a faster @entity84 processor			2
it did feel zippy as we flipped through the new passbook feature , watched movies and scrolled through websites ; however , these tasks were n't exactly lagging on the @entity17			2
games were a great place to see the processor in action , where detailed graphics are rendered incredibly fast			0
also noticeably speedy was the new panorama feature in the camera app , which processed a 360 - degree image of the room almost instantly			1
for many similar third - party apps , there 's a short wait time while the images are stitched together			2
the demo devices were all running the new version of @entity6 's mobile operating system , @entity106 6 , which has @entity6 's first @entity108 - free maps app. the flyover feature turns cities into interactive , @entity112 images			2
you can drag a finger to spin around a skyscraper and zoom in and out of the city from any angle , not just the straight - down satellite view			0
there is a bit of lag on the loading time when you move to a new area , but somehow the features still feel shockingly fast			0
flyover is more fun than functional , but perhaps the stunning graphics and turn - by - turn directions will distract consumers from what 's newly missing from the @entity131 app , like the very useful public transit directions feature			2
the room was too loud to test out the @entity135 voice assistant , which has turned to third - party services to improve results			2
restaurant results are now powered by @entity140 , movie times and reviews by @entity143			0
it has also added @entity146 integration			0
and the devices were all connected to @entity148 , so tests of the new @entity151 cellular connections will have to wait until we have devices in hand			0
@entity6 refreshes the @entity15 we also spent a bit of time with the @entity13			0
the @entity13 is like the @entity3 's kid brother , always inheriting old clothes and toys			2
it has @entity135 and the 5 - megapixel camera from the last version of the @entity3 , as well as the @entity163 processor			1
the last generation @entity13 got the retina display and front - facing camera already available on the @entity3			1
but this time , the @entity13 got two of the @entity3 's most stunning new features at the same time : the taller screen and crazy thin and light body ( the @entity13 is actually .06 inches thinner and weighs 0.85 ounces less than the @entity3 )			1
the choreography of an @entity6 event during the hands - on time , @entity6 executives milled about the room , including smiling ceo @entity176 , who was shaking hands and giving a lot of hugs			2
he had good reason to be happy ; the phone appears to be top - notch , its new body an impressive feat of engineering			0
it may not be the most mind - blowing upgrade , but that does n't diminish its level of quality .			1

most striking feature of the new @entity3 is how light and thin it is
the @entity3 has a 4 - inch screen , making room for extra row of apps
upgrades are n't mind - blowing , but final *product* is still incredible
