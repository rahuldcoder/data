@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 returned early wednesday to a large swath of central and southern @entity1 that was plunged into darkness when power from a major hydroelectric dam was lost			1
up to 18 of @entity1 's 26 states were left without power when electricity from the @entity11 dam was interrupted around 10:15 p.m. ( 7:15 p.m. et ) tuesday , leaving @entity12 , @entity0 and other cities in darkened chaos			1
hundreds of people were trapped in elevators			2
subways , trains and buses stopped running their routes			2
@entity21 showed long snaking lines of cars at a near standstill on the roads , their headlights the only illumination			2
the outage also led to medical emergencies , with a report in @entity12 of neighbors having to rescue someone who breathes with the help of a ventilator but the back - up battery was running low			1
police also reported increased robberies and looting related to the blackout			1
authorities in @entity0 and other cities stepped up enforcement			0
officials said up to 60 million of @entity1 's nearly 200 million residents were pitched into darkness			1
" i thought , ' how is this happening ? ' " said @entity0 resident @entity46			0
" all of @entity48 is black			0
" @entity52 was restored to most of @entity1 by 6 a.m. ( 3 a.m. et ) , the government - run @entity50 news agency said			1
but some water - treatment plants remained affected wednesday			0
authorities in @entity12 reported that 3 million residents in the metropolitan area remained without water , down from a previous 6.7 million			0
@entity12 is the largest municipality in @entity58 , with about 11 million inhabitants in the city and nearly 20 million in the metro area			2
the @entity11 , one of the world 's largest hydroelectric facilities , is shared by @entity1 and @entity65 , which also lost power			1
neighboring @entity67 also reported outages			1
@entity11 provides more than 19 percent of @entity1 's energy and 87 percent of @entity65 's , @entity50 said			1
the outage affected 18 states , the @entity71 news outlet said , citing @entity1 's minister of mines and energy , @entity76			1
the states of @entity12 , @entity78 do @entity79 , @entity0 and @entity80 went totally dark , while @entity81 , @entity78 , @entity82 , @entity83 do @entity79 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity83 do @entity93 were partially affected			0
the @entity94 in which @entity95 , the nation 's capital , is located also had outages			2
as a point of reference as to how widespread the blackout was , it is about 2,000 miles from the southern tip of @entity84 to the northern tip of @entity92			2
@entity104 , the director general of the agency that runs the dam , said the blackouts were caused by a failure in the @entity1 power delivery system , not the hydroelectric plant at the dam			1
officials said three transmission lines went out			0
officials said they had not determined an official cause for the power failure , but pointed at the weather			2
they discounted any type of sabotage			0
" apparently , according to information that we have , it was because of meteorological conditions that were pretty adverse , with strong winds and strong rain at the same time , " @entity120 said			0
some experts agreed that the electric system should not collapse because of a storm			0
" there is a problem , " said @entity130 , director of the @entity131 at the @entity132			0
" and you ca n't say under any circumstances that this is due to nature			0
there is a transmission problem , and the worst part of it is the dimension it takes			0
that is to say , an accident that can tumble one line is always possible			0
but for the power to go out in so many cities for such a long time , that should n't happen			2
" some residents blamed a sudden surge in electricity use as @entity1 , which is in the @entity153 , enters spring and the weather gets warmer			1
" those responsible for the energy supply do not perceive that the weather is changing and that there 's a lot of hot weather in the spring , " said @entity132 resident @entity155			1
" @entity161 promises to be hot , and everyone is turning on air - conditioners and fans			0
" the nation 's ability to handle basic utilities concerns some officials as @entity1 prepares to host the @entity169 in 2014 and the @entity170 two years later			1
" i always say that @entity1 is a country that is growing much , that everyone takes pride in , that is talked about favorably in the rest of the world , but that has a @entity179 infrastructure , " said @entity171 , director of the @entity1 center for infrastructure			1
" when we have consumption peaks , there are blackouts			2
if the government does not invest in infrastructure , the problems will be more serious each time			0
it will lead to the strangulation of economic growth and could embarrass the country in events like the @entity169 and the @entity170			0
" @entity2 's @entity192 and journalists @entity193 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			1
