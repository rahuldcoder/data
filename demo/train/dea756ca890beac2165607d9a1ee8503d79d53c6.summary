-- voters this year may be more anxious than angry			1
just 35 percent think the country 's on the right track , according to exit polls tuesday night , to 62 percent who think things are heading in the wrong direction			2
voters are n't quite as pessimistic as they were just two years ago , when those numbers were 21 and 74 percent -- but they 're unhappier than they were back in 2006 , when 41 percent felt the nation was on the right track , to 55 percent who said they were headed in the wrong direction			1
the economy was n't just the most important issue to voters this year -- with unemployment hovering around 9.6 percent , it was roughly twice as important to them as the other top issues of concern combined			1
sixty - two percent of voters named the economy as their most important issue this year			1
health care ranked a distant second , at 19 percent , with illegal immigration and @entity28 trailing at 8 and 7 percent			0
with the exception of the 3 percent of voters who said the economy 's doing just fine , most of those polled -- on either end of the political spectrum -- think the economy 's ailing			1
but who 's to blame ? thirty - five percent of voters in early exit polls say @entity43 's the villain			1
the next name on the list : former president @entity47 -- 29 percent point their fingers in his direction			1
president @entity51 follows , at 24 percent			1
they may not blame him for the state of the economy , but just 45 of voters in early exit poll results are happy with @entity51 's performance , while 54 percent disapprove			1
that 's the same territory president @entity60 's numbers were in back in 1994 exit polls , when 44 percent of voters approved of the job he was doing , while 52 percent were unhappy			1
back in 2006 , the same numbers for president @entity47 were 43 and 57 percent			1
the rest of the federal government is n't off the hook -- voters in both parties are upset with how activist the government 's been : 4 in 5 @entity73 say it 's doing too much			1
and 2 in 3 @entity74 say it is n't doing enough			0
sixty - one percent of @entity74 say the new health care law needs to be expanded			0
and 82 percent of @entity73 say it should be repealed			0
today 's result is all about who showed up ... and who did n't			0
independents made up about a third of the electorate today -- and they broke big for @entity73			0
@entity74 are barely holding on to their advantage among women -- but men have turned @entity73 by a wide margin			0
( in @entity87 , they broke big for @entity89 candidate @entity88 , giving him half the independent vote in a three - way race			0
) two - thirds of @entity94 voters , 6 in 10 young voters and the overwhelming share of black voters backed @entity74			1
there just are n't as many of them as there were last cycle , as a percentage of the total vote : the percentage of youth voters dropped by half in early exit polls , from 18 to 9			1
the black vote also edged down by at least a fifth			0
midterm voters tend to be older than voters in general			1
but this year 's midterm voters were n't just older than the voters who show up when the @entity115 is up for grabs			1
they 're older than a typical midterm voter			0
in fact : seniors have n't made up this big a share of voters since 1994			1
twenty - four percent of those who cast ballots this year were over the age of 65 -- and their support for @entity74 has plummeted			0
back in ' 94 , 48 percent of voters over age 65 backed @entity74 candidates			1
in 2006 and ' 08 , 49 percent supported the party			0
this year , that number sank to 39 percent			0
and older voters -- who are n't fans of the health care bill -- have discovered a new - found fondness for the @entity73 : the @entity73 's share of the senior vote soared from 48 percent last cycle to 58 percent this year			2
how much credit should the @entity138 take for tonight 's @entity73 gains ? exit polls paint a mixed picture			0
forty - five percent of independent voters expressed support for the movement , which is 4 for 6 in @entity89 races so far tonight , with two still too close to call			2
the older you are , the polls suggest , the more likely you are to back the @entity138 -- and tonight was a senior moment			0
forty - seven percent of those 60 and older back the @entity138 ; the number for 18 - 29 - year - olds was more than 20 points lower			0
on the other hand : a majority of voters ( 56 percent ) said the @entity138 was n't a factor in their vote tonight			2
the percentage that said they wanted to send a message in favor of the movement ( 23 percent ) was just a few points higher than those who said they were trying to strike a blow against it ( 18 percent )			0
@entity73 are on track for the biggest @entity115 pickup by any major party since 1948 -- a historic win			2
voters clearly are n't too happy with the @entity74			2
but exit polls suggest they are n't terribly thrilled with the @entity73 either			0
@entity74 have a 10 - point favorability gap : 43 percent of voters have a positive opinion of the party , while 53 percent are n't thrilled			2
the @entity73 also gets a thumbs - down from 53 percent of the nation 's voters , with just 41 percent saying they 're happy with the party			2
compare that with 1994 and 2006 , when voters had a net positive view of the incoming party			2
the numbers suggest tuesday night may signal a rejection of the @entity74 -- but something less than an embrace of the @entity73 .			0
