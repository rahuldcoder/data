-- it 's no @entity2			2
but then again , 007 probably could n't patrol the ocean depths , in disguise , for hours at a time			1
@entity6 , the robotic jellyfish			1
designed by a team of researchers at @entity12 's @entity11 , the robot is 5 feet , 7 inches wide and weighs 170 pounds but is stealthy enough to one day be used as an underwater spy for the military			1
@entity6 is part of a nationwide , multi-university $ 5 million project funded by @entity18 @entity17 and the @entity19			0
the goal is to create self - powering , autonomous robots that could be used for underwater surveillance or to monitor the ocean environment			1
" we are trying to get it as close as possible to the natural animal , " said @entity24 , a @entity12 doctoral student in mechanical engineering			1
" the way it looks , the way it moves , the general feel of it			0
" the @entity34 has been involved with robotic jellyfish in the past , but none has been of this magnitude			1
@entity12 's research team , led by mechanical engineering professor @entity39 , unveiled an early prototype called @entity41 in 2012			1
but that robot was only as big as a man 's hand			1
" one reason to develop a larger vehicle is payloadâ € ” more room to put instruments , allowing you to achieve more complex missions , " @entity24 said			2
" but another important thing is that as your robot gets bigger , it actually becomes more efficient ... biologists have shown that the animals , as they get bigger , actually use less energy going from point a to point @entity58 " @entity6 , named after the jellyfish @entity59 , has eight aluminum arms and a white , flexible silicone covering			1
it is designed to mimic the way a real jellyfish propels itself through the water			2
a control box in the middle of the jellyfish serves as the robot 's " brain			1
" the robot does not currently carry a camera , but researchers say one could be added , along with other monitoring instruments			1
" @entity6 has a basic control system			0
we program @entity6 beforehand and basically map out what we want it to do			0
so when we turn on @entity6 in the water , it follows this mission that we pre-programmed , " @entity24 said			0
one of the limitations of this prototype is how long it can swim			0
the robot can last about four hours continuously using a rechargeable nickel metal hydride battery			2
" we 're somewhat limited by the batteries , " @entity24 said			0
" the idea behind the project is to develop these vehicles that can last as long as possible and require as little maintenance as possible			2
in the future , we 're trying to leave this robot in the ocean for weeks and months at a time			1
" the research team is exploring alternative energy sources to power the robot			2
" if you look at the natural animal , it ca n't swim infinitely without eating			0
it 's the same thing with the robots			0
they have to refuel , " he said			0
" we 're looking into energy harvesting using any sources that we can in the ocean â € ” solar , wave energy			0
we 're also looking into some more novel methods such as the digestion of nutrients in the ocean waters using microbial fuel cells			0
" although this prototype is still years away from being deployed in the ocean , there are plenty of potential uses			1
the robot could be used to study schools of fish , monitor ocean currents or handle cleanup duty from oil spills			1
not to mention play a role in covert military surveillance operations			0
" one of the strengths of the jellyfish as far as stealth is that it 's an animal you do n't really feel threatened by , " @entity24 said			2
" if i saw a shark and a jellyfish ... and both of them turned out to be robots , i would definitely pay more attention to the shark			0

researchers develop a robotic jellyfish that could be used for undersea surveillance
the robot has a white silicone covering that acts as a disguise
it 's been developed by grad students at @entity12 's @entity11
the robot is still years away from being deployed in the ocean
