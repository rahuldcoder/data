-- democrat @entity1 , buoyed by strong results from voters in @entity4 , has defeated @entity6 attorney general @entity5 in the race for @entity4 's governor , @entity0 projects			1
while both campaigns took on national issues , such as the partial government shutdown earlier this year and the health care law 's flawed rollout , the race was nasty from the outset and devolved into incessant mudslinging and personal attacks			0
voters throughout the commonwealth of @entity4 were bombarded by negative ads. libertarian @entity22 , a third - party candidate , has pulled in 7 % of the vote with more than 90 % of the vote counted			2
that 's a significant chunk when the @entity6 and @entity27 candidates are so close			0
@entity1 will succeed @entity28 gov. @entity28 , who 's not running for re-election because @entity4 governors can not serve consecutive terms			1
what might make results from @entity4 -- along with races including a gubernatorial contest in @entity36 , a race for mayor in @entity39 and a primary battle for a @entity43 @entity42 seat in @entity44 -- most interesting is what they may tell us about 2014 midterms and the 2016 race for the @entity42			1
5 things to know about this year 's most important race democrat @entity52 has defeated @entity6 nominee @entity53 in the race for mayor of @entity39 , @entity0 projects , making the public advocate the first @entity52 to lead the nation 's largest city in 20 years			1
after @entity52 won the @entity27 nomination in a crowded and circus - like field earlier this year , the @entity52 's victory in the general election was never in question			2
all polls going into the election had @entity52 defeating @entity53 in a landslide , with one released monday indicating @entity52 was ahead of @entity53 with likely voters by more than 40 %			2
earlier tuesday night , in another long - predicted result , @entity36 gov. @entity70 won four more years leading the @entity36 by defeating @entity27 state sen. @entity72 in the state 's gubernatorial race			1
@entity70 's victory became a forgone conclusion long before polls closed in @entity36 , as public opinion polls for months have indicated the tough - talking @entity6 headliner was far ahead of his @entity27 challenger			1
there are national implications to the race , too			0
with @entity70 considering a run for the @entity6 presidential nomination in 2016 , his re-election campaign is seen as a tuneup or stepping stone for that likely @entity42 bid			2
according to @entity0 exit polls of @entity36 voters , @entity70 performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for @entity27			1
early exit polls indicate the @entity6 governor grabbing 56 % of the female vote , and winning all age groups other than those 18 - 29			0
@entity70 also took a fifth of the @entity102 - @entity43 vote and 45 % of @entity103 , a much better performance than most @entity6 in recent elections			2
@entity4 and @entity36 are the only two states that hold elections for governor in the year after a presidential contest			1
and as a more moderate @entity6 won in @entity36 and a conservative @entity6 lost in @entity4 , the establishment candidate defeated the @entity112 candidate in a @entity6 primary runoff for a congressional seat from @entity44 's 1st district			1
@entity116 , a former state senator , defeated businessman @entity117 in the race , according to @entity0 projections			2
the contest was seen as a precursor to more intraparty fights ahead in primary elections for the 2014 midterms and was the first time @entity6 voters could weigh in on which direction they want to take their party after the partial federal government shutdown in october			0
here 's a closer look at some of the night 's most interesting races and ballot measures : a nasty race in purple @entity4 the @entity1 and @entity5 campaigns engaged in nasty political warfare that took over the airwaves in @entity4			1
@entity1 made sure women were aware of @entity5 's support of " personhood " legislation that critics say restricts abortion and some forms of birth control , while @entity5 frequently highlighted federal investigations of an electric car company that @entity1 co-founded			1
both sides also attempted to frame the race as a referendum on larger national issues			0
@entity5 's supporters argued a vote against @entity1 was a vote against @entity154			1
@entity1 and @entity27 pinned @entity5 as a tea party activist , linking him to conservative lawmakers in @entity158 who initiated a strategy that eventually led to last month 's government shutdown			2
democrat @entity1 wins @entity4 governor 's race , @entity0 projects what @entity70 's 2013 re-election bid tells us about 2016 @entity70 performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for @entity27			1
early exit polls indicate the @entity6 governor grabbing 55 % of the female vote , and winning all age groups other than those 18 to 29			0
@entity70 also took one fifth of the @entity102 - @entity43 vote and half of the @entity177 vote , a much better performance than most @entity6 in recent elections			2
what @entity70 's victory means for the next presidential race @entity39 picks first @entity27 mayor in a generation at the center of the race were disagreements over taxes and the city 's controversial " stop - and - frisk " program backed by incumbent mayor @entity191			1
@entity193 campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $ 500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten , an idea @entity53 vehemently opposed			0
while @entity53 painted himself as a fiscal conservative , he sought distance from national @entity6 on social issues by reiterating his support of abortion rights and same - sex marriage			0
@entity193 expected to win @entity39 mayoral race deep - pocketed @entity6 pick winner in @entity44 @entity116 , the establishment candidate , far outraised @entity117 , the @entity112 candidate , thanks to major help from the business wing of the party , including the @entity210			1
he also garnered endorsements from establishment figures , including several @entity6 @entity42 leaders			0
in total , @entity116 has raised nearly $ 700,000 , with substantial donations from business community political action groups and individual business donors			0
@entity117 , on the other hand , has raised $ 260,000 and has received donations from a political action committee run by former @entity223 @entity6 @entity222 candidate @entity221 , a darling of the tea party movement , as well as endorsements from conservative talk show hosts @entity229 and @entity228			0
however , despite that support for smaller tea party personalities , @entity117 was largely ignored by the national tea party groups			0
@entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 -- three of the largest national tea party groups -- sat on the sidelines of the intra-party fight			0
establishment beats tea party in @entity44 runoff also on the ballot @entity39 is not the only major city holding a mayoral contest on tuesday			1
voters in @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 are also electing mayors			0
and voters in six states will be weighing in on 31 ballot measures			0
among the most interesting : genetically modified food labeling in @entity255 , a proposed special marijuana tax in @entity257 , secession in 11 @entity257 counties and a push to raise @entity36 's minimum wage to $ 8.25 per hour			2
pot tax , secession top state 's ballot measures @entity0 's @entity265 contributed to this report .			0
