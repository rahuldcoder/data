-- a @entity2 space freighter carrying cargo to the @entity5 has crashed in a remote area of @entity7 , @entity2 emergency officials said wednesday			1
the unmanned progress cargo craft , which launched at 7 p.m. in @entity9 ( 9 a.m. et ) from the @entity10 , was due to dock with the @entity5 on friday			1
rescue teams have been dispatched to the crash site of the @entity13 , the regional branch of the @entity14 told @entity0			0
officials could not immediately confirm whether the crash might have caused any damage on the ground			0
@entity2 's @entity20 news agency reported that the rocket had come down in the @entity22			1
earlier on wednesday , @entity2 government space agency @entity23 reported that the cargo ship had deviated from its planned trajectory shortly after takeoff , failing to reach the target orbit , and had disappeared from radars			2
" the engine system 's erratic functioning and its subsequent breakdown occurred during the operation of the third stage at the 325th second of the flight of the @entity39 carrier rocket with the @entity41 resupply vehicle , " @entity23 said in a statement			0
the spacecraft was to deliver more than 3.5 tonnes ( about 3.85 @entity43 tons ) of cargo to the crew of the @entity5 now orbiting the @entity46 , @entity23 said			2
the load included food supplies , medical equipment , personal hygiene items , as well as scientific equipment needed for experiments aboard the @entity5 , according to space officials			1
there are currently six astronauts at the @entity5 -- three from @entity2 , two from the @entity43 and one from @entity57			2
" the situation with the loss of the @entity13 is not good , of course , but there are stocks of necessities aboard the @entity5 to support the cosmonauts that will be sufficient to last out until the arrival of the next progress " cargo ship , @entity2 's @entity69 executive @entity68 told @entity2 's @entity20 news agency			1
" the cosmonauts wo n't have to save on food - stuffs , " he said			0
another @entity13 freighter is scheduled to launch on october 28 , @entity68 said			0
space experts said wednesday 's crash was the first failure of a progress cargo unit in more than 30 years of operation			1
however , it is the second failed space launch in @entity2 in less than 10 days			0
on august 18 , @entity2 lost a sophisticated @entity81 - @entity80 telecommunications satellite when the launch vehicle put it into the wrong orbit			0
in the latest incident , mission control @entity84 said it had received a report of an " off - nominal situation " during the progress rocket 's third and final stage			2
@entity94 spokesman @entity93 , at the @entity92 in @entity84 told @entity0 that contact with the space craft had been lost about three minutes before it was to reach orbit			0
he said the six people currently living on the @entity5 are " well supplied -- actually oversupplied " since the delivery of goods by the final @entity43 shuttle mission , carried out by @entity102 last month			1
@entity94 is now reliant on the @entity23 to ferry @entity43 astronauts to orbit , since the grounding of the @entity43 shuttle fleet has left the @entity43 with no way to lift humans into space			2
plans are in the works for private companies to begin shipping cargo to the station , and eventually to carry astronauts as well			0
progress - series space freighters have been the backbone of @entity2 space cargo operations for decades , @entity2 news agency @entity116 reports			1
in addition to taking supplies to the @entity5 , they have been used to carry out scientific experiments and help adjust the space station 's orbit , the agency reports			1
the @entity92 in @entity126 is home to @entity94 's astronaut corps and trains astronauts from the @entity43 and other nations			1
@entity0 's @entity131 and @entity132 contributed to this report .			0
