@entity0 -- an unprecedented court hearing for @entity5 's @entity4 in a financial corruption scandal , scheduled for april 27 , was postponed friday after a prosecutor filed an appeal , judicial officials said			1

princess @entity4 is @entity24 ' youngest daughter			1
this is the first time since democracy was restored in @entity5 in 1975 that a member of @entity24 ' immediate family has faced preliminary charges of any kind , in any case , a spokesman for the @entity26 said			1
on wednesday , the investigating magistrate , judge @entity34 , issued the 18 - page order that brought preliminary charges against @entity4 in a fraud case centered on her husband , @entity38 , the king 's son - in - law			1

the other is well - known criminal lawyer @entity69			0
the @entity26 initially said on wednesday it would n't comment on judicial matters , but later in the day announced that it was surprised that the judge -- who last year said in an order that there was insufficient evidence to name the princess as a suspect -- had changed his mind			1
in his order , the judge said that further investigation since last year had led to the decision to bring preliminary charges against the princess			0
