-- psychic or just plain phony ? if there was any reason to believe that a crystal ball is hiding in that bulbous head of @entity5 the octopus , be warned : this article might just disappoint			1
ready ? some marine biologists and experts say it 's more than likely that @entity5 does n't have the gift of prophecy after all			1
what 's more likely is that he 's learned to recognize the @entity16 flag			1
the 2 - year - old octopus , who was born in @entity19 and now lives in a @entity16 aquarium , has become a @entity22 phenomenon after correctly predicting the winners in all six of the @entity16 national team 's matches			1
" he has a run that many gamblers will only ever dream of , " said @entity27 , a spokesman for the @entity28			0
" @entity5 is running a remarkable series of picks , but i honestly doubt that he has extrasensory abilities			1
" during each prediction , two mussel - filled acrylic boxes labeled with a team 's flag are lowered into his tank			2
whichever box he chooses conveys the winning team			0
the eight - tentacled oracle has been relatively consistent , plopping himself over the @entity16 box in his first few predictions			1
but he drew cries of despair from assembled watchers before the semifinal round , when he lingered over the box for the @entity16 flag before opting for the @entity54 flag instead			1
@entity54 won the match 1 - 0			0
for the final game of the @entity22 , @entity5 picked @entity54 , again , to win against the @entity57			1
octopi are among the most intelligent sea creatures in the world , said @entity61 , an animal keeper at the @entity62			1
being keen learners and natural hunters , they quickly figure out how to maneuver and finagle objects in the wild in order to sustain themselves			0
yet when kept in captivity , as @entity5 has been , they must often be trained to accept prepared food , @entity61 said			1
@entity27 said that at the @entity28 , which has a giant @entity75 octopus , marine biologists usually give the animals @entity78 boxes with different latches , lids and arrangements to see if they are able to retrieve their food			0
and it 's this ability to pick things up quickly that might explain why @entity5 is consistently picking the winning team			2
" looking at the series of predictions , it appears that this may have been a learned task , " said dr. @entity86 , a marine biology professor at @entity87 in @entity88			0
@entity86 , who has worked with cephalopods for more than 20 years , believes that @entity5 's first pick may have just been pure luck and that he has been picking the @entity16 flag since his @entity97 days because the sea creature has learned to do so			1
" it 's a simple form of conceptual learning , " she said			0
by recognizing shapes and patterns , octopi will learn to gravitate toward them and even pick up skills , such as opening a jar or a box , that will lead them a food treat			2
" they are very attentive to people			0
it 's possible to train them , even unwittingly , " @entity86 said			0
but what about the times that he did n't pick the @entity16 flag ? part of their learning process , @entity86 said , is that " once in a while , they might choose something else			1
" then what about the red and yellow in the @entity16 and @entity54 flags that @entity5 has been consistently attracted to ? there 's no truth in that either , experts say			1
while octopi have excellent eyesight , they 're colorblind			2
" they do n't have color vision , but they are able to see different shades of gray , " said @entity134 , curator of fishes at the @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138			0
" if anything , you have to factor distance and his trained abilities into this whole mystery of @entity5 's psychic powers			2
" @entity5 's trainer , @entity150 , could not be immediately reached for comment			2
@entity61 , the @entity62 animal keeper , said that fans will have to wait until sunday to see whether the octopus will be able to prove to the world his powers			0
" it 'll be amazing to see what he does next , " @entity61 said			0
" he 's just gotten lucky every time			0
we should take him to @entity161			0

experts say @entity5 the octopus has simply learned to recognize the @entity16 flag
@entity167 are *highly* intelligent and can recognize shapes , patterns and even people
the creatures have keen eyesight but are colorblind
