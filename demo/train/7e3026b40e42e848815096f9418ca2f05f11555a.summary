-- " it 's not fair ! " as advertisers quit the @entity4 radio program -- and as @entity8 politicians squirm uncomfortably -- the broadcaster 's fans are complaining about double standards			1
yes , they 'll concede , maybe @entity4 went too far in denouncing a female law student as a " slut " and a " prostitute " and then demanding that she post a sex tape online for him to view			1
but look ( they continue ) at all the liberal / lefty broadcasters who have also said obnoxious things ! no one calls @entity20 politicians to account for them			1
why us ? it 's a question that will be aired often in the week ahead			2
here 's the answer , in four points			2
point 1 : even by the rough standards of cable / talk radio / digital talk , @entity4 's verbal abuse of @entity26 set a new kind of low			1
i ca n't recall anything as brutal , ugly and deliberate ever being said by such a prominent person and so emphatically repeated			0
this was not a case of a bad " word choice			0
" it was a brutally sexualized accusation , against a specific person , prolonged over three days			0
point 2 : the cases that conservatives cite as somehow equivalent to @entity4 's tirade against @entity26 by and large did bring consequences for their authors			1
after @entity45 for example made an ugly joke about @entity48 's daughter , he delivered an abject seven - minute apology on air			2
( to which @entity48 responded by refusing the apology and insinuating that @entity45 was a child molester			0
) when liberal talker @entity54 nastily called my dear friend @entity56 a " slut " on his radio show , @entity53 responded by suspending @entity59 for a week without pay from his tv show			1
@entity59 likewise apologized in person on air			0
( @entity56 accepted the apology with grace and humor			0
) the exception to the general rule is @entity69 , who never apologized for calling @entity48 by a demeaning sexual epithet			0
but now see point 3 : point 3 : @entity4 's place in @entity73 public life is in no way comparable to that of @entity45 , @entity69 or @entity54			1
@entity45 is not a political figure at all ; and while @entity69 and @entity59 strongly identify as liberals , neither qualifies as anything like a powerbroker in the @entity20			0
i 'm sure the @entity82 re-election effort is happy to have @entity69 's million - dollar gift , but i sincerely doubt there is a @entity20 congressman who worries much whether @entity69 criticizes him			2
a word of criticism from @entity4 , by contrast , will reduce almost any member of the @entity8 caucus to abject groveling			1
see , for example : @entity93 , @entity94 among tv and radio talkers and entertainers , there is none who commands anything like the deference that @entity4 commands from @entity8 : not @entity103 , not @entity104 , not @entity105 , not @entity106 at his zenith			1
@entity20 politicians may wish for favorable comment from their talkers , but they are not terrified of negative comment from them in the way that @entity8 politicians live in fear of a negative word from @entity4			1
the ultimate test came in 2002 , the vote to authorize force against @entity119			0
almost every liberal talker opposed that vote			2
@entity125 , with her eye on a presidential run in 2008 , voted in favor			0
that is why no one asks @entity20 politicians to repudiate the latest strident statement from an @entity106 or a @entity105			0
there 's no sport in it			2
it 's too easy for them to say , " sure			2
" for @entity8 , it 's tough			0
but maybe , after this latest outburst , a little less tough ? @entity136 : @entity137 on why men are the missing element in the contraception debate point 4 : most fundamentally , why the impulse to counter one outrageous stunt by rummaging through the archives in search of some supposedly offsetting outrageous stunt ? why not respond to an indecent act on its own terms , and then -- if there 's another indecency later -- react to that too , and on its own terms ? instead , public life is reduced to a revenge drama			1
each offense is condoned by reference to some previous offense by some undefined " them " who supposedly once did something even worse , or anyway nearly as bad , at some point in the past			0
but this latest @entity4 outburst is so " piggish , " to borrow a word from @entity164 , as to overwhelm the revenge drama			1
( on saturday , @entity4 apologized " for the insulting word choices			1
" ) it is the bottom of the barrel of shock talk			0
and the good news is that from the bottom of the barrel , there is nowhere to go but up			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			1

@entity175 : @entity4 's *backers* *assert* liberal talkers also *guilty* of outrageous statements
he says the hunt for equally offensive comments is a waste of time
@entity186 : no one on the left holds the power broker position @entity4 has on the right
even by the standards of radio talk , @entity4 's tirade was a new low , @entity175 says
