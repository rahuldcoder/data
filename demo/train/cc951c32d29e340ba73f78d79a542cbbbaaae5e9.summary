-- the judge in the sodomy trial of @entity4 opposition leader @entity3 handed him a key victory tuesday when he ruled that dna taken from items @entity8 used in his police jail cell is inadmissible			1
authorities had hoped to swipe dna taken from a toothbrush , water bottle and hand towel in @entity8 's cell -- and compare it with the dna recovered from semen left in his accuser 's body			1
" none of their witnesses gave evidence that @entity8 drank from the bottle of water or used the towel or toothbrush , " said defense lawyer @entity22			2
" the items were taken from the police cell and anybody could have used them			0
so the evidence was lacking from the start			0
" " if the prosecutors ca n't link @entity8 's dna to the boy 's body semen , which is the main crux of the case , then they do n't have a case , " she added			1
" so that 's why we feel a big chunk of the case is gone			1
" @entity48 , even if consensual , is punishable by 20 years in prison in the majority - @entity51 country			1
@entity8 has pleaded not guilty to the charge			0
investigators arrested @entity8 in july 2008 -- four months after a loose coalition of opposition parties he led made gains on the ruling party in parliamentary elections			0
" i do n't believe that i 'm going to get a fair trial , " @entity8 told @entity0 in february 2010			0
" a fair trial would require a competent , independent judge to immediately strike out the charge because any sexual assault must have a case to support the charge			2
" @entity8 has called his arrest a " dirty trick and conspiracy " orchestrated by authorities who are trying to discredit him			2
" they think that by doing this they can frustrate the opposition because they think the coalition will be more fragile without me , " said @entity8 , who oversees a multiethnic opposition alliance and his own @entity72			0
" clearly they have underestimated the commitment of the ( parties )			0
" the @entity81 has said that @entity8 's arrest " raises serious questions and concerns			2
" @entity8 was the heir apparent to former prime minister @entity85 until 1998 , when he was sacked and charged for corruption and sodomy			0
@entity8 spent six years in prison after being convicted on corruption charges in 1999 and on sodomy charges involving his wife 's former driver in 2000			1
@entity4 's highest court overturned the sodomy conviction and ordered him released from prison in 2004			1
however , the corruption verdict was never lifted , barring him from running for political posts until 2008			0
a loose coalition of opposition parties -- with @entity8 at the helm -- won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections in march of that year			0
it was the second time in the country 's history that the ruling party failed to gain the two - thirds majority needed to amend the constitution			1
@entity8 has said the investigators trying to build a case against him are the same ones who hid evidence that could have cleared him in his sodomy - related conviction in 1999 .			1

authorities had hoped to compare the dna to that taken from the victim
the main crux of the prosecution 's case was the dna , defense says
sodomy can result in a 20 - year sentence in @entity4 even if consensual
