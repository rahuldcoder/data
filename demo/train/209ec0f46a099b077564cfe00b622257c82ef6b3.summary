-- very few people outside of comic book store regulars knew what " @entity4 " was before this past summer , and yet it 's now the biggest movie of 2014 so far			2
@entity7 hopes to continue that astounding success for years to come			1
so when the studio announced its movie slate through 2019 , there were character names and terms used that might be unfamiliar to a lot of moviegoers			1
but never fear -- we 're here to explain			2
' @entity7 ' set for july 6 , 2018 , the movie about @entity20 ' cosmic alter ego caused a lot of excitement on social media , especially among fans who feel that female comic book characters have gotten short shrift on the big screen ( something which rival @entity29 recently addressed by announcing a " @entity31 " movie )			1
@entity7 first appeared in the comics in 1968 , sharing the name of a once wildly popular character from the 1940s ( which was the subject of a lawsuit with @entity29 in 1952 for his similarities to @entity38 )			1
@entity7 's version of @entity7 was originally an alien officer , and the name has been transferred to multiple characters over the years			1
however , @entity7 achieved new popularity when @entity20 ( previously @entity44 ) assumed the captain 's mantle			1
the character has been something of @entity7 's answer to @entity31 , so in some ways , it makes sense that she would be the star of its first female - led movie			1
( the long - rumored " @entity55 " movie appears to be on hold , at least for now			2
) ' @entity57 ' the first black superhero in mainstream comics appeared in 1966 , and will make his big screen debut on november 3 , 2017			1
@entity61 will portray the character ( though he will be seen in the next " @entity64 " movie first ) , who hails from the fictional @entity67 nation of @entity68 and is chief of the tribes there			2
in the comics , he has been an on - again , off - again member of the @entity72 , and even replaced @entity73 for a brief time			2
in 2006 , he married the @entity75			0
' @entity76 ' up until now , this is the character we 've heard the most about , especially when it comes to plentiful casting rumors ( most recently , @entity81 )			0
what we know is that the movie is out on november 4 , 2016 ( delayed from july ) , directed by @entity84			0
and the doctor title is for real -- he was a neurosurgeon before becoming a sorcerer			0
since 1963 , anything involving the occult would eventually lead in the direction of the good doctor			0
( and check out that incredible cape ! ) ' the @entity93 ' november 2 , 2018 will see another @entity7 movie , not necessarily based on a household name			1
the @entity93 are actually a race of superhumans ( not to be confused with the @entity98 ) that has a royal family			0
they 're a society in and of themselves			0
and it does n't hurt that they can live about 150 years			0
there 's more than enough material here for what @entity7 surely hopes will be a franchise of " @entity93 " movies			1
' @entity109 : @entity110 ' ever wanted to see @entity111 face off against himself ? looks like you 'll get your chance in the third " @entity109 " movie ( which co-stars fan favorite @entity115 ) on july 28 , 2017			0
@entity110 is a cyborg clone of @entity109 who is up to no good			0
this will almost certainly put the @entity38 vs. @entity121 fight from " @entity122 " to shame			0
' captain america : @entity124 ' as long rumored , @entity125 will once again reprise his @entity127 role in this " @entity64 " three - quel			0
2006 's " @entity124 " is one of the most memorable recent story arcs in @entity130 , with @entity64 and @entity127 coming to blows over the @entity132 , which requires anyone with powers to register themselves with the government			2
@entity127 is all for it , but @entity64 , not so much			0
' @entity72 : @entity137 ' this is the big kahuna , which will take place over two movies , releasing on may 4 , 2018 , and may 3 , 2019			1
@entity7 promises these two films will bring everything that preceded them to a head			1
the 1992 comic book story involved many characters of the @entity147 , and followed up on a previous story arc setting up @entity149 ( most recently seen in the " @entity4 " movie ) as one of the big bads of @entity130			1
this promises to be the big showdown between the @entity72 and one of the most powerful villains of all			0
the next five years will be huge for @entity7 fans , no doubt about it .			2
