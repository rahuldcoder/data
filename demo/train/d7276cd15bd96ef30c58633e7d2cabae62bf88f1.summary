@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 air force colonel and pilot who was entrusted with flying @entity5 across @entity1 has pleaded guilty to charges of murder , rape and dozens of sexually motivated break - ins			1
police say col. @entity11 confessed that he murdered two women , sexually assaulted two others , and broke into dozens of homes in search of women 's lingerie			1
he was arrested in february after being pulled over at a police roadblock near the home of @entity20 , one of his murder victims			1
he pleaded guilty in an @entity24 courtroom on monday , sparing victims and their families weeks of gruesome testimony			1
the country is now bracing for victims ' impact statements during the sentencing phase			1
lurid details of how the colonel video - recorded and photographed his victims and saved this evidence as " trophies " are expected to be aired			1
a portrait of @entity11 as a merciless sexual predator is beginning to emerge			1
many are wondering how a man trusted with the country 's most sensitive military secrets could have , for so long , kept so many secrets of his own			2
" down deep it 's still hard to believe it , that it 's the same guy			1
but we 've accepted it			1
it does n't make any sense at all for those that knew him , " said @entity49 , a neighbor and friend of @entity11 for 14 years			2
" i think there 's two personalities there , " added @entity49 , who said that the colonel kept many details of his life to himself but was always very friendly and a good companion			1
he described a man who was an avid fisherman and jogger , and someone who was the consummate professional at work			0
but @entity49 said that in hindsight it was strange that @entity11 never spoke of his family or his past			0
" he was extremely secretive			0
we never knew anything about his family till after the fact			0
but that 's all in hindsight , of course , " he said in an interview with @entity2			2
@entity11 divided his time between his home in @entity0 and a country cottage in southern @entity24 , both of which he shared with his wife , @entity84 - @entity83			0
in legal evidence filed as part of a civil suit , @entity84 - @entity83 said she had no idea of the crimes her husband had committed and described herself as being devastated by what she had learned			0
@entity49 said he took the time to write her on behalf of their mutual friends			0
" i sent @entity95 a letter , a letter on behalf of our small group that sat together every evening for coffee and that			0
i sent her a letter , explained that we were her friends , we were there to stand by her , " he said			0
" @entity105 heard back from her			0
" no one seems to have had any idea that the colonel was leading a double life			2
for many , to try to figure out what could have triggered such a deadly spree of sexual attacks has been a nagging mystery			2
most troubling for victims and their families is the great lengths police say @entity11 went to to preserve the video , pictures and mementos from his crimes			1
it seems to have been a consuming obsession for the highly decorated military commander			0
police say dozens of these " trophies , " along with other souvenirs of his crimes , were hidden and even catalogued in his upscale @entity0 home			2
despite his confession , @entity11 has so far given no indication as to what could have driven him to such bizarre and cruel behavior			0
victims were subjected to hours of sexual torture and made to pose for video and photographs , usually while blindfolded and bound			1
" unanswered questions : how , why , when , where , everything , " said @entity49 , who added that despite @entity11 ' guilty plea , " i 'm sure we 'll never know			0
