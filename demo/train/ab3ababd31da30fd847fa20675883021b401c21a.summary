travelers gather their luggage before checking in for a flight at @entity9 tuesday			1
about 41 million @entity1 will travel at least 50 miles from home around the holiday , according to @entity13 auto club			1

the dip represents the first decline in travelers since 2002			1
" i think with the economy going downward , people are holding off on traveling , " @entity13 spokeswoman @entity19 said , noting that the largest drop this @entity2 is in flying			1
the @entity23 of @entity1 is projecting a 10 percent decrease in the number of air passengers flying over a 12 - day period around the holiday , but airline capacity cuts prompted by record - high fuel prices over the summer mean planes will remain crowded			1
travel in the skies appeared to be off to a good start wednesday afternoon			1
only a few major airports were experiencing delays by mid-afternoon , and most delays were well under an hour			2
the @entity23 expects planes to be close to 90 percent full , on average , on the busiest travel days			1
" you 'll see plenty of people on airplanes that are full , " @entity23 spokesman @entity40 said			2
he urges air travelers to arrive at the airport early , be prepared to go through security checkpoints and travel light , as space in overhead compartments and underneath seats will be limited			1
@entity52 : share your travel experiences @entity55 student @entity54 , 21 , planned to fly out of @entity57 ' new airport for the first time			1
she usually makes the trip to @entity60 , @entity61 , to visit her father a couple times a year			2
" i know they have more @entity67 checkpoint lanes , so it should be faster getting through security , but i 'm not sure as far as lines , " @entity63 said of the new airport			2
" i 'm going to try to get there at least two hours before my flight this time			0
" last week the @entity67 expanded its family lane program to every security checkpoint			0
families , individuals who are unfamiliar with security procedures , travelers with special needs and those carrying medically necessary liquids in amounts exceeding the @entity67 's allowances can use these lanes to get through security at their own pace			1
@entity63 planned to check a bag on her @entity89 flight because her travel dates dodge the carrier 's fee for a first checked bag , going into effect december 5			2
many major carriers have instituted fees on passengers ' first checked bags , with higher fees for additional bags			0
in addition to mounting airline fees , @entity2 holiday travelers are paying on average 8 percent more for tickets this year , according to @entity13 's @entity106			1
ireporter @entity107 , 28 , could n't afford to pay the fares he found to fly from @entity110 , @entity61 , with his son and fiancee to visit family in @entity114			0
he looked for tickets online four or five times a week for several months , but the lowest fare he could find was $ 348 per ticket			0
@entity107 said he drives to @entity114 when he has time to make the 16Â½ - hour trip			0
" lately , it 's turned into a trip that i have to drive			0
even whenever gas prices were at almost $ 4 a gallon , i had to drive it , because it 's still less expensive than flying when you look at three people traveling , " @entity107 said			0
driving is n't an option for the long weekend , he said , even with average gas prices dipping below $ 1.90 a gallon			0
@entity107 wo n't be among the 33.2 million @entity1 @entity13 expects to travel by car this year			1

" even though people might be trying to tighten their purse strings right now , it 's not the time to let your maintenance lapse on your car , especially if you live in a cold - weather environment , " @entity19 said			0
have your antifreeze checked , check your windshield cleaning fluid , replace your wiper blades and monitor your tire pressure , she advised			0
as with any travel , the weather will be a big factor in how smoothly drivers are able to get to their destinations			2
to ease congestion in the sky that may be compounded by weather , president @entity157 has authorized the use of military airspace for @entity2 " express lanes			1
" corridors along the @entity165 , in the @entity166 , the @entity167 and the @entity168 will be opened to commercial airliners			0
" every little bit helps , no question about that , " said the @entity23 's @entity40			0
" when we run into congestion in the airspace , having those extra lanes is a benefit			0
it 's not a solution to delays			0
it 's one of a number of solutions to reducing delays			2
