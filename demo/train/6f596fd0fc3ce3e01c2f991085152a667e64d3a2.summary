-- one more time , @entity1 brought a crowd to its feet			2
" @entity5 " had earned record of the year at the 1994 @entity8 festivities , with the accompanying " @entity10 " soundtrack taking home best album			1
but for all the awards that @entity1 earned that night , it was her voice that resonated most -- as it did throughout her career			2
the iconic songstress ' range and power were on display once again sunday night , echoing through the packed @entity20 moments after the music world 's luminaries bowed their heads in prayer in honor of her death			1
by the time a replay of her 1994 performance was complete , the audience 's applause gave way to an emotional standing ovation			1
a day earlier , @entity1 was pronounced dead in her fourth floor room at a @entity35 , @entity36 , hotel			2
the world may wait as many as eight weeks -- when results from toxicology and other tests should be in -- to learn what happened , with assistant chief @entity42 of the @entity44 's office saying little sunday besides " foul play is not suspected			0
" headlines in recent years about @entity1 have tended to focus more on her battles with drug addiction and her relationship with her ex-husband , " @entity53 " performer @entity52 , than her musical accomplishments			0
yet recollections of her enormous talent took center stage sunday night in @entity44 , as did the six - time @entity8 winner 's membership in the music world 's " family			1
" @entity63 , host of the @entity64 , spoke right away to @entity1 's personal and professional legacy , soon after taking the stage following an opening performance by @entity68			1
" tonight , we ask ourselves : how do we speak to this time ? to this day ? there is no way around this			0
we 've had a death in our family , " he said			0
the rapper and actor then offered his prayer , thanking @entity79 " for sharing our sister @entity1 with us			0
" " and although she 's gone too soon , we remain truly blessed to have been touched by her beautiful spirit and to have her lasting legacy of music to cherish and share forever , " he said			0
during the show , stars of past and present -- from @entity86 to @entity87 -- celebrated the late singer			1
the sentiments voiced sunday night echoed those that have been offered ever since news broke of @entity1 's death from close friends , musical icons and everyday fans who never met the iconic performer but were moved by her music			1
then , after a memorial honoring other stars from @entity104 to @entity105 who also died this past year -- and nearly three hours after @entity63 promised the @entity8 " will remember you the best way we know how : with a song " -- @entity107 appeared under a bright , solitary spotlight			1
wearing a black sleeveless dress and anchored firmly in the middle of the stage , the @entity109 and two - time @entity8 winner offered her own rendition of " @entity5			2
" twice during the song , the crowd burst into applause			0
@entity118 offered one small embellishment , changing a lyric to sing : " @entity1 , we will always love you			0
