-- when @entity2 is forced to defend its citizens from @entity5 terrorism originating from @entity6 , we 've come to expect outrage around the world			1
critics are quick to condemn @entity2 's military actions -- some with such heavy - handed charges as " war crimes , " " atrocities " and even " genocide , " while remaining silent about the terrorists who started the conflict			1
at anti-israel protests around the world , violent anti-semitism is on full display , thinly veiled as criticism of @entity2			1
demonstrators in @entity23 have attacked @entity2 embassies			1
in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 and other @entity30 countries , the protests have led to anti-semitic attacks on @entity33 people , community centers and synagogues			0
we 've seen violence and incitement against @entity33 rising in @entity39 as well			0
it has been lost on no one that this pronounced anti-semitism has its antecedents in @entity25 and the @entity44			0
fortunately , some responsible @entity30 leaders are standing up to the hatred and bigotry			0
but their words may not be enough , as @entity2 continues to be treated as the international community 's whipping boy in the latest conflict			1
it is time for moral clarity on @entity6			0
@entity55 intentionally started this conflict			1
@entity55 militants built miles of underground tunnels -- at least 30 tunnels in all -- using about 600,000 tons of cement and other materials that could have built homes or schools for @entity65			1
instead , it went into a sickening subterranean network of tunnels designed to carry out surprise terrorist attacks across the border in @entity2			1
it has been said that the only real growth industries in @entity6 are in rocket - building and tunnel construction			0
this unconscionable waste of resources has brought about the two crowning " cultural " achievements of @entity55 : thousands of rockets raining down on @entity2 towns and cities and terrorists armed to the teeth emerging from holes in the ground , intent on kidnapping more @entity2 soldiers and killing @entity2 civilians			1
this culture of death is an essential part of @entity55 ' identity and ideology and has motivated the @entity55 leaders for the more than eight years they have controlled @entity6			1
the world knows that @entity55 intentionally stores its rockets in homes , mosques , hospitals and schools			1
no matter how careful @entity2 tries to be in warning civilians before attacks , no matter how much restraint it exercises , @entity55 has guaranteed that civilians will be victims			1
children make up nearly half the population of @entity6 , and so women and children are among those dying because of @entity55 's maximalist strategy against @entity2			1
@entity2 did not want this war , and certainly does not want to see civilians killed			2
but no matter , the calumny continues to rain down on @entity2			2
has anyone condemned @entity55 for the death of 160 children during the construction of the @entity6 tunnels ? the @entity120 reports @entity55 uses child labor to build its terror tunnels and prizes their nimbleness and work ethic			1
on the news every day there is the macabre body count of how many civilians have lost their lives in @entity6 , invariably accompanied by a comparison with the cost of life for @entity2 soldiers and civilians			2
counts vary , but most put the numbers of @entity5 deaths around 1,800 and @entity2 deaths at 65			2
all deaths that come about as a result of this conflict are tragic			0
but who is taking steps to limit casualties ? @entity2			2
who is apologizing for the loss of life in @entity6 ? @entity2			2
@entity55 , on the other hand , tries at every opportunity to inflict as much pain as possible on @entity2 , trying to kill more @entity2 civilians by firing rockets at large population centers , by sending suicide bombers across the border and sacrificing the lives of their own children			1
they make no apologies for their culture of death			0
look out at the world , there is no shortage of horrific violence and tragic death			0
death by the thousands , by the tens of thousands in @entity171 ; human destruction in @entity173 , in @entity174 , in @entity175			0
and in @entity175 , @entity176 are killing @entity177			0
why have the voices of outrage in response to the more than 170,000 dead as a result of @entity171 's civil war gone silent ? there are no cameras out there , there are few editorials , and there are even fewer demonstrations in the streets of @entity191 , of @entity192 or @entity193			0
here is where moral myopia verges on moral blindness			0
it seems the world wakes up only when @entity33 in their own defense -- defending their men , women and children -- are forced to kill @entity176 and @entity65			2
that 's when the world demonstrates			0
this is the true hypocrisy of the " condemn @entity2 " phenomenon			0
and there can be no doubt that the @entity211 campaign that is unfolding around the world is a function of the anti-semitism that we know lurks just underneath the surface in some @entity30 societies and is all - but rampant across the @entity218 .			0

@entity220 : the world is outraged when @entity2 is forced to defend itself from terrorism
at global protests , he says , anti-semitism is thinly veiled as criticism of @entity2
@entity220 : we must *remember* @entity55 intentionally started this conflict
@entity220 : @entity55 spent millions on tunnels to attack @entity2 rather than helping @entity233
