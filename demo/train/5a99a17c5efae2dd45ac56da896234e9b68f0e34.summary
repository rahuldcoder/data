here we go : a new round of confrontation between the @entity3 and @entity4 over the federal budget is in the offing , this time in a new attempt to avert the looming " sequestration " process			1
what is sequestration ? it 's a series of automatic , across - the - board cuts to government agencies , totaling $ 1.2 trillion over 10 years			1
the cuts would be split 50 - 50 between defense and domestic discretionary spending			1
it 's all part of attempts to get a handle on the growth of the @entity22 national debt , which exploded upward when the 2007 recession hit and now stands at more than $ 16 trillion			1
the sequester has been coming for more than a year , with @entity4 pushing it back to march 1 as part of the fiscal cliff deal at the end of the last session			1
by the numbers : recent defense spending why does this seem familiar ? it started with the 2011 standoff over the @entity22 debt ceiling , when republicans in @entity4 demanded spending cuts in exchange for giving the @entity40 administration the needed legal headroom to pay the federal government 's obligations to its bondholders			1
in the end , @entity4 and the administration agreed to more than $ 2 trillion in cuts			1
about $ 1 trillion of that was laid out in the debt - ceiling bill and the rest imposed through sequestration -- a kind of fiscal doomsday device that @entity4 would have to disarm by coming up with an equal amount of spending reductions elsewhere			1
what were they thinking ? the plan was that a special congressional panel , dubbed the " super committee , " would find a less painful way to cut spending			2
it failed in november 2011			2
that left federal agencies facing what outgoing defense secretary @entity66 called " legislative madness " in the form of harsh cuts that no one wanted			0
" for those of you who have ever seen ' blazing saddles , ' it is the scene of the sheriff putting the gun to his head in order to establish law and order , " @entity66 said in a speech at @entity74 's @entity73			0
" but for many conservatives , sequestration is a feature , not a bug			0
it 's " the first chance we have for real savings and deficit reduction , " the @entity92 - aligned lobbying group @entity91 tells supporters on its website			0
" president @entity40 already agreed to the sequester savings when he signed the debt ceiling bargain into law , " @entity91 says			1
" he needs to follow through			0
" military pay in play in game of political poker where will the cuts fall ? more than $ 500 billion will be cut from the @entity108 and other national security agencies , with the rest cut on the domestic side -- national parks , federal courts , the @entity114 , food inspections and housing aid			2
while the @entity108 has laid out plans ranging from furloughs of hundreds of thousands of civilian workers to combat readiness training and weapons maintenance , the @entity3 budget office has n't specified which domestic agencies would take the biggest hits			0
@entity66 says that the $ 46 billion in spending cuts for 2013 would cut sharply into military readiness -- and the longer the cuts are pushed back , the deeper they 'll have to be to achieve the required savings			1
opinion : republicans , be smart about defense cuts so now what ? @entity4 put off the sequester until march 1 as part of the last - minute fiscal cliff deal on @entity137			1
without that agreement , economists warned that the one - two punch of sequestration and the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 @entity144 tax cuts could have thrown a still - struggling @entity22 economy into reverse			2
even with the fiscal cliff deal , the austerity moves already were slowing the economy , @entity40 suggested over the weekend			2
the @entity148 said a large cut in federal spending , primarily on defense , contributed to the 0.1 % decrease in gross domestic product seen in the last quarter of 2012			0
" @entity74 can not continually operate under a cloud of crisis			0
that freezes up consumers , " @entity40 said during a @entity157 interview with @entity158			2
" it gets businesses worried			0
we ca n't afford these self - inflicted wounds			0
" how our tribes cause gridlock in @entity4 tuesday , @entity40 urged @entity4 to pass a short - term deal that puts off the cuts , allowing some breathing room for a long - term deficit reduction plan			1
but @entity40 said any deal should include more revenue from ending some tax breaks -- a stance that inflamed @entity131 who already had to swallow a tax increase for top earners in the fiscal cliff deal			2
" i do n't like the sequester			0
i think it 's taking a meat ax to our government , a meat ax to many programs that will weaken our national defense , " house speaker @entity179 , @entity180 , said wednesday			0
but , he added , " @entity22 do not support sacrificing real spending cuts for more tax hikes			0

@entity40 , @entity4 try to avert automatic budget cuts
the $ 1.2 trillion in cuts were part of a plan to end the 2011 debt ceiling standoff
@entity4 was supposed to replace them with other 10 - year spending reductions , but failed
