@entity2 rumors of another major change in @entity6 - @entity5 policy are sparking a surge in @entity5 migrants in recent days , according to the @entity9			1
agency officials tell @entity1 that @entity5 are being told the decades - old " wet foot , dry foot " policy is going away on january 15 , and that has many of them attempting to reach the @entity6			1
the policy , which was enacted in 1995 , grants asylum to any @entity5 who reaches @entity6 soil , or " dry foots			1
" but most @entity5 found at sea would be sent back to @entity5			1
any change to that policy , which is part of the @entity19 , would need approval by @entity21 , which is highly unlikely to happen			0
" we recognize that when these rumors continue to perpetuate , they grow			2
they may try and take to the sea , " said capt. @entity27 , the chief of response for the @entity9 's 7th district , which patrols most of the waters around the island nation			1
since the @entity37 administration announced a renewal of diplomatic relations with the @entity41 government on december 16 , the @entity9 says there has been a 235 % increase in the number of @entity5 found at sea , compared with the first two weeks of december			1
overall , the final month of 2014 saw a 117 % jump year to year in the number of migrants from the @entity49 island			2
" having this many people at sea , in very unseaworthy vessels -- it just makes for a very dangerous environment , " said @entity27			2
the source of the rumors is unknown			2
but , @entity9 officials believe human smugglers and builders of makeshift boats may be partly to blame			1
" these boats are n't just laying around			0
these people are getting paid to build these boats			0
that 's the profit motive behind all this , " said @entity27			0
" there are people making money off of this			0
and they do n't care about the safety of these folks			0
i think it 's in their benefit to perpetuate these rumors			2
and we 're trying to combat that			0
" ever since @entity41 took power in @entity5 in 1959 , there have been incidents of mass migration from @entity5 -- the most famous of which was the @entity82 of 1980 , when roughly 125,000 @entity5 landed on @entity84 's shores within a six - month span			1
although the recent surge is not considered a mass migration , @entity27 says , " we 're always attentive to that			0
there 's a variety of factors that could lead to a mass migration			0
but right now , we 're not at that level			0
" but , just in case , @entity27 says the @entity9 has put additional resources in the @entity96 to deal with the current situation .			1
