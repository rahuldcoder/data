@entity0 , @entity1 -- cars and commercial airplanes move the vast majority of us around , but as any frequent traveler knows , both of these modes of transportation have their limitations			1
cars are restricted to highway speeds and the sometimes circuitous routes of our road infrastructure			1
commercial airlines , with their high security , fixed schedules and hub - and - spoke system , offset their fast point - to - point speed with large amounts of waiting , and you still have to drive on each end of the flight			1
personal aviation , where pilots operate small private aircraft , offers an alternative with the potential to get you where you need to be quickly , safely and on your own schedule , but it , too , comes with limitations			2
we founded @entity35 in 2006 to develop a solution to many of the barriers to the more widespread use of personal aviation : our work led to the development of a new kind of aircraft , which we call the " transition			2
" watch @entity47 's @entity46 i co-founded @entity35 as a graduate student in the @entity50 and @entity51 at @entity52			1
a pilot myself , i was interested in taking advantage of the new @entity55 and @entity56 that the @entity57 created in 2004 to lower the barriers to entry to personal aviation for both pilots and manufacturers			2
we used the resources that were available at @entity52 and with our local @entity65 chapter to start building a team and a business while doing early conceptual design on the transition itself			2
since the beginning i 've enjoyed applying engineering problem - solving skills to the challenge of company creation : in many ways , starting a company is just a big systems engineering design - within - constraints problem			2
i 'm also looking forward to fulfilling a dream i 've had since grade school by being able to fly something that i 've both helped design and build when i take the transition out for the first time			2
@entity46 : @entity86 flies on solar wings in describing the transition , we use the phrase " roadable aircraft " instead of " flying car " to help set expectations for what it is and how it will be used			0
as a light - sport aircraft , the transition must be operated in and out of designated airports by certificated pilots			0
( because this aircraft is easy to fly , the appropriate pilot license can be earned in weeks , instead of months or years			0
) unlike any other airplane on the market today , the transition can fold its wings on command , shift power from the propeller to the rear wheels and drive as a fully street - legal vehicle on any road in the @entity110			1
designed to meet the @entity111 , it is the first light airplane to incorporate automotive - style safety features such as dash - mounted airbags , a passenger safety cage and energy - absorbing crumple zones			1
for added safety in flight , there is a full vehicle parachute for use in case of emergency			0
while the transition is not intended to replace the modern automobile , it does have the potential to improve travel significantly			0
at less than 7 feet tall , it will fit in most garages , saving rent on hangar space			0
it runs on unleaded gasoline instead of more expensive aviation fuel			0
@entity46 : @entity136 on the future of space the transition can also use any of more than 5,000 public - use airports in the @entity110 , letting the operator avoid the congestion of commercial hub airports while also flying over traffic jams on the roadways			1
after landing , being able to drive to your final destination solves the " last mile problem			1
" flying at 100 mph and traveling point - to - point in the air , on your own schedule , the transition can save hours off the typical regional trip			0
and what about the weather , something that often halts small airplane travel ? with a transition , if the weather gets bad , fold the wings without leaving the cockpit and continue the trip safely on the road			1
if the weather clears later in the trip , drive to a nearby airport and get back in the air			1
in short , the transition addresses the cost barriers , weather sensitivity , long door - to - door travel time and lack of ground mobility that has thus far kept personal aviation from playing a significant role in meeting our transportation needs			1
as of early 2012 , @entity35 is conducting an extensive set of tests on our two production prototype aircraft			0
these aircraft incorporate all of the improvements that we were able to make following the completion of flight and drive testing of our proof of concept aircraft in 2009			1
covering both flight and road use , we 're using a combination of powered testing , static load testing and sophisticated analysis and simulation to demonstrate compliance to the light - sport aircraft standards as well as the applicable @entity111			0
if this testing program continues to go well , we could be delivering the first aircraft to private owners around the end of this year			0
while it is not the " flying car " of " @entity204 , " the transition is a state - of - the - art solution to improving personal mobility today			2
from the reactions we get to the aircraft whenever we have the opportunity to share it , it 's clear that even with its practical approach , the transition is rekindling a shared dream of more personal freedom			0
as with many disruptive products , it is difficult to predict where this technology will take us in the future , but i believe that the transition is the next major step in improving how we navigate our world			0
i would encourage you to think about where you 'd like to go once you have an airplane in your garage			1

@entity47 : we depend on cars and planes for most transportation
she says the highway system and commercial plane *network* limit mobility , choices
@entity242 and her *colleagues* are developing a plane that can drive legally on roads
if the prototypes succeed , *people* will be able to park airplane in garage , she says
