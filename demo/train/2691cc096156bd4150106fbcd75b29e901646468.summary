nearly 35 years ago , @entity1 revolutionaries stormed the @entity3 embassy in @entity4 and began a painful chapter for @entity3 as the " @entity6			1
" today , the building where @entity8 raged and captives were held for 444 days is now an @entity11 cultural center and a propaganda museum of sorts for the @entity14			1
@entity16 's chief national security correspondent @entity15 visited the complex this week			1
it is rare for westerners to walk its halls			2
although the two - story building shows no signs of terror from the 1979 - 81 hostage crisis , it remains a symbol of mistrust that still endures for many			1
upon entering , the counter area where @entity31 guards had been posted when the embassy was seized is intact , as is the colorful tile work on some of the walls			1
there are offices on the first floor , while exhibits are displayed on the second			2
upstairs is an office where @entity16 's guide says the @entity43 was housed			1
the entrance is the door to a vault			2
" is it the same combination that it was ? " @entity15 asks			0
" yes , " the guide responds , explaining the students who stormed the building extracted the combination from hostages during what he said were " negotiations			1
" past the vault door , the @entity1 claim was the secure section where the @entity43 worked			0
that 's a reason the guide gives for the takeover , which was dramatized in the @entity62 - winning film @entity63			1
while many @entity1 have grown disillusioned with the @entity11 revolution , anti-american anger endures			0
" do you still believe it was justified to hold the @entity3 as hostages ? " the guide is asked			0
" based on international law the @entity3 embassy should function as the embassy and not interfere in internal affairs			1
it 's like somebody is snooping around your house			0
what would you do ? " each room and every piece of equipment is an exhibit			0

bright red murals cover the main stairway walls leading to the second floor			2
the paintings tell a familiar @entity98 conspiracy theory claiming the @entity3 was behind the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
" do you believe @entity3 brought down the twin towers ? " the guide is asked about the @entity101 in @entity102			0
" for sure , yes , " he replies adamantly			0
why would @entity3 would kill its own people ? " they wanted to make their people believe they are in danger so they could attack other countries , " he says			0
