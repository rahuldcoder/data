-- working in public health for 14 years in @entity2 , @entity3 , in a border region with poor health conditions , has taught me a lot about how disease threats can get a boost from an unsuspected source			0
for tuberculosis , this unsuspected source is now diabetes			2
@entity13 is common globally but mistakenly thought of as something that does not affect the @entity15			1
it is an airborne , bacterial infection , easily spread by coughing , and it can be fatal			0
it often lies dormant in the body for many years , and most of the 11 million people in the @entity15 who have the infection are not even aware of it			2
the only vaccine has limited effectiveness and is not given in the @entity15			2
@entity13 continues to have a serious impact in @entity15 , with nearly 9,600 cases in 2013 , according to the @entity26			1
it is not only an issue on the @entity15 border with @entity30 ; rather , it is found in every state , with a particular impact in @entity33 , @entity3 , @entity34 and @entity35			2
drug - resistant varieties pose an alarming threat since the required treatment is so lengthy and often toxic			0
today , the biggest risk for tuberculosis is not @entity41 , which led to a surge in cases in the late 1980s , but diabetes			1
diabetes impairs the immune system and leaves a person who has been exposed to @entity13 much more likely to develop active disease			1
fast facts on tuberculosis this is precisely what we saw when we started to investigate @entity13 in communities on the border with @entity30			1
the alarm has spread to @entity34 and the @entity57 , where 20 % to 30 % of @entity13 cases can be traced to diabetes			1
@entity13 experts in @entity33 are also concerned about this phenomenon			2
is this on the radar of health providers treating diabetes patients in the @entity15 ? unfortunately , few are aware of the risk of @entity13 or are looking for it			1
they are also unaware that the course of @entity13 disease is frequently more severe in patients with diabetes , who do not tolerate @entity13 drugs well			1
diabetes patients often have difficulty completing treatment , take longer to be cured and are more likely to relapse , even die , and develop drug - resistant @entity13			1
@entity13 physicians in @entity3 are acutely aware of the problem			2
one told me about a woman with severe diabetes in her 30s			0
when exposed to @entity13 , she quickly developed active disease			2
despite the best efforts of the medical staff , she was not able to absorb the @entity13 medication due to nausea and vomiting			2
as a result , her @entity13 became drug - resistant , and she had to undergo a rigorous , two - year ordeal of treatment			0
five of her children also became infected , and two had to be treated for active disease			0
she was cured and survived , but this is not always the case			0
the dimensions of the problem are truly staggering			0
diabetes is an exploding global epidemic , much larger than hiv / aids			0
in @entity104 , diabetes has nearly doubled the number of cases of @entity13			1
today , 26 million of the 382 million people with diabetes live in the @entity15			1
by 2035 , nearly 600 million people in the world will have diabetes , and by 2050 so will a third of all @entity15 , according to the @entity112 and the @entity26			1
ignoring this new threat could result in a reversal of the decline in @entity13 experienced over recent years			0
diabetes took my teeth but not my life so what do we need to do ? we must educate health care providers , patients and communities			0
all @entity13 patients should be screened for diabetes			1
diabetes caregivers and their patients need to be aware of the risk of @entity13 , and patients born in or traveling to neighborhoods or countries where @entity13 is common should be screened			1
if @entity13 is found , these patients need treatment , along with the support they need to get through the many months of daily medication			0
we also need strong investment in research and development of @entity13 vaccines , rapid and inexpensive diagnostic methods for both @entity13 and diabetes , and fast - acting , easy - to - take @entity13 medication			1
research largely depends on government funding since the pharmaceutical industry shows little interest in @entity13			0
@entity148 has not made @entity13 a priority despite the increasing risk to the public at large			0
we all know someone with diabetes			0
diabetes could reverse the achievements of several decades in @entity13 control , but , if we combine good science , adequate funding and above all , political will , we can get ahead of this looming crisis			1
we responded slowly to the combined @entity41 / @entity13 threat in the 1980s			0
we need to react faster to the diabetes / @entity13 threat today			2
diabetes continues to spread around the world the opinions expressed are solely those of dr. @entity167 .			0

nearly 9,600 cases of tuberculosis were *reported* in the @entity15 in 2013
diabetes impairs the immune system and can leave a person *vulnerable* to @entity13
the rise in diabetes cases is *worrisome* , especially for tuberculosis , doctor says
