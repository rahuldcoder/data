-- @entity1 recently announced that it would start including individual users ' names and photos in some ads. this means that if you rate some product positively , your friends may see ads for that product with your name and photo attached -- without your knowledge or consent			2
meanwhile , @entity16 is eliminating a feature that allowed people to retain some portions of their anonymity on its website			0
these changes come on the heels of @entity1 's move to explore replacing tracking cookies with something that users have even less control over			1
@entity29 is doing something similar by developing its own tracking technology			2
more generally , lots of companies are evading the " @entity39 " rules , meant to give users a say in whether companies track them			1
turns out the whole " @entity39 " legislation has been a sham			1
it should n't come as a surprise that big technology companies are tracking us on the internet even more aggressively than before			1
if these features do n't sound particularly beneficial to you , it 's because you 're not the customer of any of these companies			1
you 're the product , and you 're being improved for their actual customers : their advertisers			1
for years , these sites and others have systematically improved their " product " by reducing user privacy			1
this excellent infographic , for example , illustrates how @entity16 has done so over the years			0
the " @entity39 " law serves as a sterling example of how bad things are			1
when it was proposed , it was supposed to give users the right to demand that @entity46 companies not track them			2
internet companies fought hard against the law , and when it was passed , they fought to ensure that it did n't have any benefit to users			1
right now , complying is entirely voluntary , meaning that no internet company has to follow the law			2
if a company does , because it wants the pr benefit of seeming to take user privacy seriously , it can still track its users			2
really : if you tell a " @entity39 " - enabled company that you do n't want to be tracked , it will stop showing you personalized ads. but your activity will be tracked -- and your personal information collected , sold and used -- just like everyone else 's			1
it 's best to think of it as a " track me in secret " law			1
of course , people do n't think of it that way			0
most people are n't fully aware of how much of their data is collected by these sites			2
and , as the " @entity39 " story illustrates , internet companies are doing their best to keep it that way			1
the result is a world where our most intimate personal details are collected and stored			0
i used to say that @entity1 has a more intimate picture of what i 'm thinking of than my wife does			0
but that 's not far enough : @entity1 has a more intimate picture than i do			2
the company knows exactly what i am thinking about , how much i am thinking about it , and when i stop thinking about it : all from my @entity1 searches			0
and it remembers all of that forever			0
as the @entity123 revelations continue to expose the full extent of the @entity126 's eavesdropping on the @entity46 , it has become increasingly obvious how much of that has been enabled by the corporate world 's existing eavesdropping on the @entity46			2
the public / private surveillance partnership is fraying , but it 's largely alive and well			2
the @entity126 did n't build its eavesdropping system from scratch ; it got itself a copy of what the corporate world was already collecting			0
there are a lot of reasons why internet surveillance is so prevalent and pervasive			0
one , users like free things , and do n't realize how much value they 're giving away to get it			0
we know that " free " is a special price that confuses peoples ' thinking			0
@entity1 's 2013 third quarter revenue was nearly $ 15 billion with profit just under $ 3 billion			0
that profit is the difference between how much our privacy is worth and the cost of the services we receive in exchange for it			0
two , internet companies deliberately make privacy not salient			1
when you log onto @entity16 , you do n't think about how much personal information you 're revealing to the company ; you 're chatting with your friends			0
when you wake up in the morning , you do n't think about how you 're going to allow a bunch of companies to track you throughout the day ; you just put your cell phone in your pocket			1
and three , the @entity46 's winner - takes - all market means that privacy - preserving alternatives have trouble getting off the ground			1
how many of you know that there is a @entity1 alternative called @entity174 that does n't track you ? or that you can use cut - out sites to anonymize your @entity1 queries ? i have opted out of @entity16 , and i know it affects my social life			0
there are two types of changes that need to happen in order to fix this			0
first , there 's the market change			0
we need to become actual customers of these sites so we can use purchasing power to force them to take our privacy seriously			1
but that 's not enough			0
because of the market failures surrounding privacy , a second change is needed			0
we need government regulations that protect our privacy by limiting what these sites can do with our data			1
surveillance is the business model of the @entity46 -- @entity202 recently called it a " stalker economy			0
" all major websites run on advertising , and the more personal and targeted that advertising is , the more revenue the site gets for it			1
as long as we users remain the product , there is minimal incentive for these companies to provide any real privacy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity220 : it 's no surprise that companies are tracking us more aggressively
@entity220 : keep in mind that you 're the product ; their real customers are the advertisers
he says for example , the " @entity39 " law is essentially *useless* to protect *consumers*
@entity220 : many sites run on advertising ; companies have little incentive to provide privacy
