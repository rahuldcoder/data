-- every now and then , i spend time on @entity2			1
i dig my naked toes into the fine , red - orange soil , watch how it clings to my skin -- and feel an incipient itch			2
the iron - rich dust is pretty alkaline			2
the air -- or lack of it -- also makes me itch			2
pretty soon , i 'll break out in what the locals call " vacuum rose , " as the blood boils in capillaries beneath my skin , because the air on @entity2 is pretty nearly a vacuum			1
that does n't mean the atmosphere ca n't kick up a planet - girdling storm when the weather is just right			1
right now , as evening approaches , the sky is a dusty pink , tending to brown - black in the east			2
the sun is a brilliant disk in the west , one - third smaller than i 'm used to on @entity31 and not nearly as warming			1
feathery layers of dust fan out around the lowering sun , and a few smeared - out ice - crystal clouds glint silvery gray , but the rest of the sky is clear , and the stars above stand out brighter and sharper than night on @entity41			2
one of @entity2 ' two moons , @entity43 , or " panic , " named after one of the war - god 's dogs , is little more than a big , tumbling rock			1
the second dog or moon is @entity51 , " @entity52			2
" @entity43 is blacker than sin , blacker than soot , but still visible to my naked , freezing eye			2
it 's cold out right now , about -40 degrees @entity57			2
martians call this a balmy summer evening			2
tech : internet explodes with joy over @entity63 of all the planets apart from @entity31 in our solar system , @entity2 is the most hospitable			1
better keep my visit short			0
and yet , despite the discomfort , the danger , i love it here			0
i love coming back for these imaginary vacations			0
trudging up the slope of @entity76 , the largest volcano in the solar system , you 'll hardly notice the climb , it 's so gradual			1
but by the time you 've finished the 180 - mile journey , you 're about 14 miles higher than the datum -- what passes for sea level here			0
@entity84 is about 5Â½ miles			0
but once very likely there were seas , possibly big ones			0
mostly shallow , basic and even fizzy , especially around out - gassing volcanic vents , all just right for potential extremophiles			0
extremophiles are life forms that adore conditions we find harsh			1
for them , @entity2 could have been heaven			1
and here 's where the romance of @entity2 gets really good			1
i 'm going back in time			0
... ca n't stop myself			0
@entity102 somehow guessed the correct number of @entity2 ' moons ( two )			1
@entity106 astronomer @entity105 saw what he described as " channels , " or canali			0
@entity112 @entity111 , knowing a good @entity110 move , then made " canali " into " canals			0
" @entity114 had us invaded by octopoid , blood - drinking @entity117 tired of living on their old , worn - out world			0
@entity119 upped the ante on @entity122 's canals by populating the ancient red planet with gorgeous , oviparous princesses and warlike , four - armed green @entity117			1
in a few decades , @entity2 heated up			1
news : rover captures nearby rocket footprint @entity128 sealed the deal by making us all @entity117			0
he sent us there ; we stared into the water in the canals -- and our reflections , the faces of new @entity117 , stared back			0
but not even @entity128 , back when he wrote " @entity136 , " could have imagined how the real story might play out			2
the " canals " are n't there any more			0
we ca n't find them , do n't see them			0
but if evidence of @entity2 lakes and oceans pans out , @entity2 might have been hospitable to life hundreds of millions of years earlier than @entity31			1
@entity31 was still cooling down from its natal heat , still barraged by asteroids , and life , if it developed at all here , was probably getting the crap kicked out of it on a regular basis			1
starting over again and again from scratch , or not starting at all			0
until -- and this is just speculation , but it may have a foundation in fact -- until something big hit @entity2 and sprayed the seeds of @entity2 life across the gulf of space to land on @entity31			1
we 've analyzed small meteorites knocked loose from @entity2			1
they fell onto @entity167 , and some scientists have taken the very controversial view that there is evidence of life in them			1
not proven , not certain , but ... light years : 5 reasons to be excited about @entity63 my vacation on @entity2 could really be a homecoming			1
we may all be @entity117			0
would n't that be utterly cool to know ? scientists need to know			2
but you do n't have to be a scientist to find the science of @entity2 compelling			1
maybe an interest in genealogy will do			0
the challenge of getting to @entity2 is extreme			1
it 's close as planets go , every now and then approaching less than 40 million miles to @entity31 -- but missions to @entity2 can spend months or years in space , depending on the economics and fuel load			1
landing is tricky because aero - braking and parachutes are far less effective than in @entity31 's thicker atmosphere			1
in the 1970s , the @entity198 landers came down on their own rockets , but they did n't carry rovers and looked around from a fixed position			0
still , they sent us our first clear pictures of @entity2 from the surface			1
engineers like making tough jobs look impossible , sometimes			0
in 1997 , @entity207 bounced down , literally , within a big cluster of very tough beach balls , which then deflated and released @entity210 , a cute - as - a - bug wandering robot			0
in 2004 , @entity214 and its twin , @entity216 , both came down bouncing as well			0
news : unmanned versus manned exploration @entity63 , too large for that kind of landing , made its final descent winched from a @entity222 , rocket - powered flying crane			0
but doubtless you know that story			2
the animation and videos are astonishing			0
and they 're only going to get better			0
why do we capital - @entity229 love @entity2 so much ? because it 's beautiful , it 's tough , it 's buried in our mythic , childhood memories			1
it 's covered with human triumphs but also with sad stories of failure			2
this time , the engineers and scientists are jubilant			2
we 're back , baby			0
@entity31 is definitely our mother , but maybe , just maybe , we 're going to learn who 's our papa			1
it would be fun to be a martian			0
complete coverage on @entity2 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			1

@entity249 : i like to imagine taking a vacation on @entity2
he says the thin atmosphere and frigid *temperatures* make it a harsh *environment*
after @entity31 , it 's considered the most hospitable planet for life in the solar system , he says
bear : scientists , *writers* and nerds have all been fascinated by the story of @entity2
