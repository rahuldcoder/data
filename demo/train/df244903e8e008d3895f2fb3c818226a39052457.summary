-- last week , we gave you digital tips and tricks for surviving a layoff -- the first seven days , at least			1
now , here we are again , an entire wednesday later , prepared to help you gird your loins for the job search ahead			1
so , wipe the @entity9 dust from your fingers and peel yourself out of that body - shaped imprint you 've made on your bed			1
your bout in the ranks of the unemployed probably wo n't be short -- on average , unemployed workers have been jobless for 40 weeks , a number that has n't changed much in the last six months			0
but of course , you should aim to make it as brief as possible			0
" the longer you 're laid off , the harder it is to get back in the market , " says @entity19 , @entity21 's connection director			1
act fast to get the ball rolling before you forget what it feels like to wear real pants and chit - chat over a box of donuts ( with other people , that is )			1
one positive note : the whole ordeal might not be as miserable as you think ( " funemployment , " anyone ? )			0
last year , an @entity36 study found that unemployed folks were actually happier than the drones stuck in miserable jobs			0
maybe this 'll be the best thing that ever happened to you			0
( @entity44 jump ! rah ! rah ! ) read on for a few social network to - dos to get you back in the rat race			1
last week we covered strategically letting your circles know about the change in employment status ( in short : be brief , be upbeat , and only tell those who could specifically help you )			0
a similar principle is at play as you 're seeking out potential business contacts to bug			0
" a mistake a lot of people make is just contacting everyone they can find with a generic note , " @entity19 says			0
a better approach : figure out something ( or someone ) you have in common with the individual , and send a personalized note along with your @entity73 / @entity72 / @entity21 request			1
" you have to get them to be interested in your situation , " she adds , " because people are busy , and why should they worry about your career ? " stalk potential employers			0
not literally , of course			0
but when job - searching online , most people tend to think about job boards such as @entity85 and @entity86			1
while there 's nothing wrong with keeping an eye out for appropriate openings ( and plenty of people indeed find new gigs on such sites ) , massive job listings are often a slang word that rhymes with " duster - duck " -- meaning they 're disorganized , crowded and teeming with humanity			1
sometimes a job will be posted days after the hiring managers have made a decision , when corporate policy requires it			2
months - old listings will mysteriously float to the top long after they 've been filled			2
and in the journalism world , for example , a listing on industry tracker @entity108 can yield hundreds of enthusiastic applications			2
go ahead and wade in the morass of job aggregators , but we recommend taking a more targeted approach in the meantime			2
brainstorm some corporations that should be dying to hire you , and figure out how you can keep dibs on them			0
" that way you 'll be privy to any movement in jobs or anything they 're doing industry-wise , " @entity19 says			0
if the company 's striking out on a new project that matches your skills , you have an in to request an informational interview with a higher - up over there , for example			1
and if you note that someone with your dream job just departed for @entity137 , you can swoop in			2
poke around their website for an rss feed of company news and add it to your own feed reader ( such as @entity145 ) for easy stalk - age			2
follow the company on @entity21 ( go to the company tab along the top , search , and follow ) to see who 's leaving ( and who will , presumably , leave behind a vacancy ) , and what current employees are in your circle -- they 're your goldmines in the " whom do i address this cover letter to ? " game			1
downplay the layoff in your job apps			2
here 's the thing : if you 're the right candidate , then you 're the right candidate -- whether you 're currently at another company or currently signing up for market research focus groups to pay the bills between rounds of job - searching			1
while there 's no shame in having been let go ( at this point , we all know upstanding employees who fell victim to the economy ) , your cover letter should shimmer with hireability , not with the grayish @entity179 of woe - is - me teardrops			1
think of it this way : if you come across as defensive , insecure or bitter about the layoff , you 'll raise all sorts of red flags in a hiring manager 's mind			0
but if you 're bursting with confidence and talent and good ideas ( and , oh yeah , it comes up in the interview that you 're looking for a new job because you do n't have one but the job termination was circumstantial and , hey , here 's a recommendation letter from your former boss ) , you seem like the kind of employee who always lands on his feet			1
and in this earthquake of an economy , a little catlike agility is a very good thing .			0
