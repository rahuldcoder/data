@entity0 -- in the wake of the @entity5 protests across the @entity6 and @entity7 , president @entity2 will pledge @entity9 economic assistance to @entity10 and @entity11 on thursday in a speech highlighting his administration 's revised policies toward the changing region			1
the highly anticipated address at the @entity17 will touch on all the @entity6 - @entity7 flash points -- the @entity21 - @entity20 peace process , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and the recent killing of @entity27 leader @entity26 -- with a focus on @entity2 's plan for how the @entity9 can help the region develop through political and economic reforms , according to administration officials			1
new bin laden audio tape released @entity2 " will be laying out a vision tomorrow for the region of what it can be long - term and its role in the world , and as part of that , we 'll be announcing a series of initiatives to support that long - term vision , " a senior administration official said wednesday			1
he was one of three senior administration officials who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified by name			0
want to reach @entity51 mr. president ? try this the speech comes nearly two years after a 2009 address in @entity56 , the @entity10 capital , by @entity2 that called for " a new beginning " between the @entity9 and the @entity59 world			1
now many in the @entity6 and @entity7 consider the @entity56 speech a collection of lofty ideals that lacked sufficient follow - through , and they want @entity2 to signal substantive and concrete policies that support the aspirations of the region 's people			1
@entity69 , a former @entity70 foreign minister and longtime advocate of @entity51 reform , said the @entity6 is a new environment now , where young men and women are laying their lives on the line for democracy throughout the region			2
they need to be told their cause is just and how the @entity9 will support them			2
" if this is going to be another @entity56 speech , forget it , " said @entity69 , now at the @entity84			0
" it was great two years ago , and even then the feedback was mixed because people wanted to see what he would do			0
if he does n't have much to add this time , people will not be fooled by it			0
" @entity2 's do - over on the @entity6 @entity96 , a 24 - year - old @entity10 activist and blogger , said that @entity2 's words will have little impact in her country			1
" at this point , whatever president @entity2 will address will really be irrelevant to what the situation is now because we 're really building democracy from the bottom up , " @entity101 said , adding that " @entity9 is not the model of democracy that we are striving for			1
" she called @entity9 policy on the @entity6 " hypocritical " because , she said , the @entity9 " will support a dictatorship if it 's aligned with its interests			1
" that attitude is rife throughout the @entity6 and @entity7 , noted @entity1 senior political analyst @entity116			2
with @entity10 facing economic crisis , the @entity22 conflict at a stalemate , an ongoing harsh crackdown on demonstrators in @entity23 and the @entity21 - @entity20 peace process at a standstill , there is little belief in the region that @entity2 or the @entity9 can do much to help , @entity116 said			1
" i think it 's going to be very difficult in the near term to generate excitement about his policies in the @entity6 , " @entity116 said			2
what 's next for the @entity5 in an effort to start changing such perceptions , the @entity2 administration on wednesday imposed tough sanctions against @entity23 president @entity137 and six other senior @entity23 officials in an effort to stop the regime 's fierce crackdown on anti-government protests			1
the sanctions also target two top @entity24 officials whose unit was a " conduit for @entity24 material support " to @entity23 intelligence , according to a copy of the executive order issued by the @entity150			0
according to the senior administration officials , thursday 's speech will focus on the opportunity for the @entity9 to help people in the @entity6 - @entity7 region gain a say in their future governance through the changes they have launched			1
@entity2 will emphasize @entity9 principles such as freedom of assembly , the right to self - determination and respect for human rights while promoting economic development as a significant contributor to helping people of the region realize their aspirations , the officials said			1
" it 's important to note that some of the protests in the region are deeply rooted in a lack of individual opportunity and economic growth , as well as a suppression of political rights , " one of the senior administration officials said			2
" we also know from our study of the past that successful transitions to democracy depend in part on strong foundations for prosperity , and that reinforcing economic growth is an important way of reinforcing a democratic transition			0
" that means that " one of the most important areas for us to focus on is supporting positive economic growth that again can incentivize and reinforce those countries that are transitioning to democracy , " the official continued			0
" we see this as a critical window of time for the @entity9 to take some concrete action to demonstrate our commitment to their future and to again reinforce their democratic transition with support for a broader base of prosperity , " the official added			2
in particular , the senior administration officials focused on economic aid for @entity11 and @entity10 intended to bolster the democratization and economic development efforts of two countries at the vanguard of political reform			1
will there be aid for @entity5 nations ? @entity2 will announce several programs intended to increase @entity9 and international investment , create jobs and spur economic growth in the two countries , the officials said			1
the goal is for @entity11 and @entity10 to serve as models for a region undergoing change , so that other countries have incentive to undertake similar reforms , according to the officials			1
specific programs include relieving @entity10 of up to $ 1 billion in debt over the next two to three years so the money can be invested by the @entity10 government in economic development plans , and providing $ 1 billion in loan guarantees to finance infrastructure development and job creation , the senior administration officials said			1
in addition , programs through international banking and funding organizations such as the @entity247 , the @entity248 , the @entity249 and the @entity250 will be worth a few billion dollars , the officials said			0
" one of the most important things we can do is empower positive models " in @entity10 and @entity11 , one of the officials said			2
" that will have a positive impact beyond their borders			0
" the @entity9 also will work with international groups and allies to help @entity6 - @entity7 countries modernize and integrate trade policies , according to the senior administration officials			1
currently , nations in the region of 400 million people export about the same amount of goods as @entity272 , a country of 8 million people , if oil is removed from the equation , said a @entity150 background document on the speech			0
@entity2 's speech comes in a week when the @entity150 has focused on @entity6 issues			2
he met tuesday with @entity70 's @entity280 at the @entity150 and will meet friday with @entity21 prime minister @entity281			0
after his talks with @entity280 , @entity2 said it was " more vital than ever that both @entity21 and @entity20 find a way to get back to the table and begin negotiating a process whereby they can create ... two states that are living side by side in peace and security			2
" however , former sen. @entity293 unexpectedly submitted his resignation as the president 's @entity6 envoy friday , and deadly clashes broke out sunday between @entity299 protesters and @entity21 forces			2
ongoing @entity21 settlement construction in the @entity302 and @entity20 steps toward a unilateral declaration of statehood have driven the two sides further apart since @entity2 took office			0
they have also placed new obstacles in the path of the administration 's push for a mutually acceptable two - state solution			0
@entity5 not good for @entity21 ? additional doubts about the viability of the stalled peace process were raised this month in the wake of a formal reconciliation agreement between the two largest @entity20 factions : president @entity321 ' party , the @entity302 - based @entity322 ; and the @entity324 group @entity323 , which rules @entity325			1
both @entity21 and the @entity9 consider @entity323 a terrorist organization and have voiced strong opposition to the inclusion of the group in any unity government , demanding that it first renounce violence , recognize the state of @entity21 and abide by all previous agreements			0
@entity281 has called on the @entity333 to pull out of the deal , saying it jeopardizes prospects for a peace agreement			0
the @entity2 administration has " made it clear that @entity323 must stop its outrageous use of terrorism and must recognize @entity21 's right to exist , " @entity150 press secretary @entity338 said tuesday			0
" any participation in a @entity20 government would require that it abides by those standards in our view			0
" in other engagement in the region , @entity2 helped push @entity10 president @entity351 from office in february and subsequently committed @entity9 forces to a @entity355 air campaign in support of the rebel movement in @entity22			1
the administration has repeatedly called for an end to strongman @entity360 's nearly 42 - year rule			0
the @entity150 has been much less vocal , however , in dealing with allies such as @entity363 , a small @entity364 state that is home to the @entity366 's @entity365			0
@entity1 's @entity367 , @entity368 and @entity369 contributed to this story .			0
