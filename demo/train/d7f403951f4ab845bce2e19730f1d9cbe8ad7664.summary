@entity0 , @entity1 -- long before @entity3 and @entity4 blazed their own paths , and decades before the @entity6 became a half - billion - dollar annual business , a hippie musician with long blond locks paved the way			1
@entity11 sang about drugs , politics , racism , sex and @entity16 -- sometimes in the same song			1
@entity11 was a christian rock musician before the genre existed , combining faith with a backbeat and social consciousness			1
think of him as rock music 's street preacher , often referred to as " the father of christian rock			1
" " between 1969 and 1979 , @entity11 was the @entity34 's answer to @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , " said @entity27 - nominated director @entity26 , who takes a critical look at @entity11 's career and life in his documentary " @entity32 : the @entity38			1
" " he set the standard			0
he created the space for others to exist			0
... the vision he created for where @entity44 could go still resonates today			0
" the documentary is scheduled to go into limited theatrical release in early 2010			0
@entity11 hit the @entity48 music scene at a turbulent time for the nation			1
his first solo album , " @entity53 , " came out in late 1969 , after he left the band people ! the @entity55 psychedelic group was fresh off the success of a @entity57 hit with a cover of the @entity60 ' " @entity59			1
" it was a time when college campuses were erupting in @entity64 protests and the nation was still trying to digest what had just happened that summer at @entity67			0
as many @entity48 looked for answers , @entity11 offered his faith , a bold decision for an unknown solo artist making his major - label debut			1

" my songs were n't written for @entity83			2
... i was saying , ' i 'm going to present the @entity84 , and i 'm not going to say it like you want			0
this album is not for you			2
' " no small surprise , given that rock music at the time was the soundtrack of the counterculture and was far from the mainstream			2
a national survey conducted by @entity95 and @entity96 in 1966 found that rock ' n ' roll was by far the most unpopular music in the country			2
about 45 percent of adults said they disliked it , with only about 5 percent saying it was their favorite			0
compare that with today , when nearly two - thirds of those asked in a recent @entity107 poll said they listen to it			0

" there were no happy songs about going to heaven ; the tunes tackled the social issues of the day			2

" stuff like that shocked uptight @entity83 , " @entity73 said in an @entity130 interview shortly after his brother 's death in february 2008 at age 60			0
" one of his songs , it 's called ' @entity139 , ' one of the lines is : ' you 've got gonorrhea on @entity144 [ @entity145 ] and you 're still looking for the perfect lay			1
... why do n't you look into @entity16 ? he 's got the answer			0
' " the album also contained what became @entity11 's signature song , " why should the @entity151 have all the @entity152			1
" nearly two decades after its release , " only visiting this planet , " helmed by @entity154 ' producer @entity153 , was recognized as a seminal recording for the genre , voted by @entity80 in 1990 as the greatest @entity34 album ever recorded			1

then he was introduced to @entity11 's music , " and i just was overjoyed and thrilled , because suddenly i could relate ... and there seemed to be a @entity34 who could do it as well , if not better , than the rest of us			1
" @entity197 of the alternative rock group the @entity199 said @entity11 has been a lifelong influence			1
" i listened to his records growing up , and saw him perform many times			0
in fact , i used to dress up like him ; long blond hair with bangs , sort of a grown - out @entity180 invasion look , with black jacket , black shirt , black pants and two - tone black and white cheerleader shoes , " @entity197 said			0
" while @entity11 is always referenced by his @entity34 beliefs , to me he was always an entertainer ... humorous , poignant and always @entity214			2

" they immediately have fans that are passionate and devout not only about them as a band or artist , but to their message			0
