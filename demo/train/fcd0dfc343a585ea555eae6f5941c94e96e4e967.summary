-- in the most comprehensive speech he has delivered on terrorism , president @entity1 declared last month that the " core of @entity5 in @entity6 and @entity7 is on a path to defeat			1
" on may 23 , the very same day that @entity1 delivered this keynote speech at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , the leader of the core of @entity5 , fired off a lengthy memo to two @entity5 affiliates in the @entity17			1
this memo demonstrates @entity19 considers himself and the @entity5 core to be still relevant and very much in charge of the global jihadist movement			0
the @entity19 memo , which was published on monday by the @entity26 news network in the original @entity27 , is addressed to the leader of @entity5 in @entity29 and the leader of @entity32 's @entity31 , which is a front organization for @entity5 , according to the @entity34			1
in the memo , @entity19 chastises the leader of @entity5 in @entity29 , in a tone that an irritated parent might use , for announcing in april the merger of the @entity29 and @entity32 wings of @entity5 " without asking permission or receiving advice from us and even without notifying us			1
" @entity13 also unloaded on @entity43 , the leader of the @entity32 wing of @entity5 , who at the same time had publicly announced his allegiance to @entity19 and the core of @entity5			1
@entity13 complained that the @entity32 branch of @entity5 had publicly outed itself as an @entity5 affiliate " without having our permission			2
" he instructed that the merger of the @entity5 's @entity29 and @entity32 wings " be dissolved " and that the @entity32 wing is " under the ( @entity5 ) general command			1
" @entity13 said he made these decisions " after holding consultations with my brothers in @entity57 , " an ancient word for the region that today contains @entity7 , which indicates that @entity19 is able to communicate with , or perhaps even meet with , @entity5 leaders along the @entity7 - @entity6 border			2
why does this matter ? it matters because " @entity68 " is now trying to assert control over two of its most virulent affiliates			0
@entity68 in @entity29 has mounted a series of spectacular attacks over the past year , which demonstrates that it is a force to be reckoned with again in @entity29 politics			0
the @entity73 reported this month that there were some dozen days in 2012 in which @entity5 carried out multicity attacks that have killed hundreds of @entity29			0
and the @entity5 affiliate in @entity32 is widely acknowledged to be the most effective fighting force that is now fighting the regime of @entity80			0
a long - term safe haven for this group in @entity32 , which is in the heart of the @entity85 world and next door to @entity87 and that is now directed by @entity89 , could create an organization with the intention and capability to attack the @entity93			0
that @entity19 continues to try to assert his control over @entity5 - affiliated groups is not all that surprising considering that @entity97 did the same thing while he was holed up in a compound in @entity100 , @entity6 , for the last five years of his life before he was killed by a navy seal team in early may 2011			0
documents found at the @entity100 compound show that @entity5 's founder was deep in the weeds of key personnel decisions			2
in a letter to the @entity110 - based @entity109 , @entity97 was adamant that @entity110 - @entity112 cleric @entity111 not become that affiliate 's new leader			0
@entity111 never did get promoted and was killed in a @entity112 drone strike in 2011			0
the mere existence of the @entity19 memo shows that he is able to communicate with relative ease with @entity5 's affiliates in the @entity17			2
because of the now - well documented dangers of using any kind of electronic communication system , @entity13 , like @entity97 before him , is almost certainly using a courier network to hand - deliver his letters			0
in closing his letter to @entity5 's affiliates in @entity32 and @entity29 , @entity13 appointed a man named @entity129 to resolve any future disputes that might arise between the two groups			1
it is n't clear to what extent @entity5 's affiliates in @entity32 and @entity29 will actually pay attention to directives from @entity19 but it is a fact that these affiliates have pledged their allegiance to him			1
if the core of @entity5 is indeed on the road to defeat as @entity1 asserted three weeks ago , @entity13 clearly has n't gotten this message .			1

president @entity1 said @entity5 's core is headed for defeat
@entity147 : terror group 's leader is still acting as if @entity5 matters
he says @entity13 *intervened* to block merger of @entity29 and @entity32 wings
to avoid *tracking* , @entity13 likely using a courier to deliver messages , @entity147 says
