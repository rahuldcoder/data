@entity1 's appearance on @entity3 's " @entity2 " on friday turned into a somewhat heated discussion when @entity3 and author @entity5 voiced their opinions on @entity8			1
" @entity9 " star @entity1 took umbrage at the pair 's contention that @entity8 is , in @entity5 ' words , a " mother lode of bad ideas " and that liberals are squeamish about criticizing @entity8 for stances on women and @entity20 issues because people " have been sold this meme of @entity22 , where every criticism gets confused with bigotry toward @entity25 as people			1
" @entity1 said @entity5 -- a neuroscientist known for works criticizing religion -- and @entity3 were guilty of using a broad brush themselves			1
it 's racist , " @entity1 said			2
" it 's like saying ' shifty jew			0
' " @entity1 added , " how about more than a billion people who are not fanatical , who do n't punish women , who just want to go to school , have some sandwiches			0
" @entity3 disagreed , questioning @entity1 on his stance : " you 're saying that the idea that someone should be killed if they leave the @entity8 religion is just a few bad apples ? " " that 's horrible , " @entity1 replied			1
" ( but ) the people who would actually believe in an act that you murder someone if you leave @entity8 is not the majority of @entity25 at all			2
" after some crosstalk , @entity5 chimed in with his view that " we 're misled to think that the fundamentalists ( in @entity8 ) are the fringe , " as @entity3 added that moderate @entity25 are afraid to speak out			1
@entity1 responded that a better idea would be to criticize the @entity25 who hold such views , not the whole religion			0
" what is your solution ? to condemn @entity8 ? " @entity1 asked			2
the actor , who also directed the @entity66 - winning film " @entity65 , " set in @entity67 and shot partially in @entity68 , has received some positive response from viewers who appreciated his perspective			0
" did anyone enjoy watching an impassioned @ @entity74 on @entity3 as much as i did ? " tweeted actress @entity72			0
" @entity2 with @entity3 " airs on @entity75 , which -- like @entity76 -- is a division of @entity77 .			0

@entity1 says @entity3 's criticism of @entity8 is " gross , " " racist "
@entity3 and guest @entity5 made point that liberals are afraid to criticize @entity8
@entity1 : @entity3 and @entity5 are conflating fundamentalists with majority
