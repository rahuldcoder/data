the campaign trail for two candidates in top - tier @entity3 races took a detour thursday to a @entity6 committee room for a high - profile hearing on @entity8			1
the outbreak has become a wild card issue in the midterm elections , and both @entity14 @entity13 rep. @entity12 and @entity16 @entity15 rep. @entity15 were eager to question top @entity18 administration officials about the federal response at a hearing that was carried live on most television networks			1
@entity12 is running neck - and - neck for the open @entity3 seat against @entity25 state sen. @entity24 , who repeatedly tries to tie him to president @entity18 and his policies			2
but @entity12 used his opening statement to criticize the federal efforts to date , saying , " the administration did not act fast enough in responding in @entity31			0
" @entity12 also name - dropped an @entity14 company that is working on an @entity8 vaccine and pressed dr. @entity34 , director of the @entity35 , for information on how quickly the government could help advance the company 's research			2
like many other @entity25 @entity3 candidates , @entity15 , who is competing against @entity13 sen. @entity40 , came out in favor of a travel ban for those flying to and from countries in @entity46 fighting the @entity8 epidemic			1
he used his time at thursday 's hearing to question @entity50 , the director of the @entity51 , about his reluctance to put more limits on travel			2
federal officials worry that a travel ban would make it harder to track people because they could take circuitous routes to get into the country			0
" their reasons today are basically the same thing as saying that all children with chicken pox stay in school so we know who they are			0
it simply makes no sense			0
we must make sure we are protecting the @entity72 people by making sure that travel from the affected area is restricted , " @entity15 said			0
it was clear that members of both parties who traveled back to @entity79 during a week when @entity80 was n't in session wanted to show voters back home they are responding to the crisis and holding federal officials accountable			0
" it 's become the top issue , " the no. 3 @entity86 , rep. @entity88 , @entity89 , said about @entity8 and the midterm elections , which are just 19 days away			1
@entity92 , the executive director of the @entity93 , told reporters thursday that concern about @entity8 is showing up in his party 's internal polling and that @entity25 candidates are responding to the public 's worries about the spread of the disease			1
" it think the @entity104 have been offering pretty concrete leadership on this issue , including calls for travel bans and such that you 're starting to see the @entity13 mirror , " he said			1
on thursday , a pair of @entity112 @entity13 -- reps			1
@entity114 of @entity115 and @entity116 of @entity117 , who are in competitive races -- also publicly called for the administration to enact travel restrictions			1
@entity114 also recommended a 21 - day voluntary quarantine for those traveling to the @entity72 from countries affected by @entity8			2
@entity25 rep. @entity124 , a physician who is running against @entity13 sen. @entity125 , did n't return to @entity79 for the hearing , but he scheduled a conference call with reporters thursday afternoon			1
he said that voters are approaching him as he travels around the state , and he slammed @entity18 's handling of the issue			0
" it seems to be part of a broader narrative that that administration lacks leadership , and that the senator whom i 'm running against frankly enables the administration and is part of their lack of leadership , " @entity124 said			0
@entity125 focused her response to the @entity8 outbreak by calling on the federal government to increase airport screenings			2
" i urge the administration to expand the current screenings from five to all 20 airports in the @entity72 where tourists , international workers and business leaders from @entity46 arrive , " @entity125 said			0
" in addition , it is important to remember , in the face of constant calls for budget cuts , that the investments we make today in our health care system , @entity161 research and emergency response training at our hospitals can help prevent and quickly contain diseases like @entity8			0
