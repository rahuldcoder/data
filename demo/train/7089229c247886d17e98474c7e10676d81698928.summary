city , @entity1 is one of the most enduring and endearing characters in movie history			1
part of what she discovers on her voyage over the rainbow is that apparently heroic , magical and / or much - admired folk -- such as the @entity13 -- will probably turn out to be no better than anybody else			1
now that i 'm a parent , i realize that @entity16 is the father figure in the movie : he 's not a bad man but not someone who can solve all his children 's problems for them , either			1
all he can really do is appreciate them for who they are , so that they learn to appreciate themselves			0
but is @entity16 someone we care to know more about ? maybe			1
as much as i enjoyed @entity33 's new movie , which is breezy and bright in myriad dimensions , i doubt his story will exert a comparable hold on the popular imagination for generations to come			1
dads just are n't that interesting -- not even to other dads			0
@entity42 @entity41 wrote 13 sequels to his most popular novel , but so far as i know , he never hit on the idea of a prequel			2
ingeniously scripted by @entity47 and @entity48 , " @entity16 " mimics the movement and character arc of the original			1
it begins in the @entity53 in black - and - white and then falls to a @entity55 in the eye of a twister			0
but we 're no longer watching @entity1 , an innocent abroad			2
instead , we have @entity59 's @entity13 ( " @entity16 " for short ) , a charismatic charlatan and a two - bit showman with an eye for the ladies -- any lady , really ; wiccans welcome ! if there 's a throne and a treasure trove at the end of the rainbow , maybe he 'll stick around the next morning			1
he 's not all heel , though			2
at least he has the decency to be embarrassed that he 's not the magical savior everyone seems to be expecting			2
he says he aspires to greatness , even if he never seems likely to stretch for it			0
@entity59 does n't quite get there , for me , in this role			2
he 's an unconvincing fraud and a shaky charlatan -- too young , perhaps , to fool anyone except himself			0
or , maybe he 's just too contemporary to pass as a 19th century illusionist			0
reportedly , @entity83 and @entity84 turned down the role , and either might have played him with more aplomb			0
presumably they were wary of messing with a solid gold classic , but while " @entity16 " does present a wide target for critics , they should n't have worried : director @entity33 ( " @entity93 , " " @entity94 " ) takes care to honor the original in spirit and in style			1
it may be an impossible job , but he 's surpassed reasonable expectations			0
the production design and the saturated colors are close enough that this movie really does work as a prequel ( albeit in @entity106 ) , and while the @entity109 is unmistakably 21st century , @entity33 's unironic celebration of pure artifice does suggest a continuum of sorts			1
today 's fashion for green screen and chroma key is not so far removed from the back projection and studio sets of @entity118 's @entity117			0
because the @entity119 exists outside our reality , even the most ersatz effects -- butterfly trees and flowers that toll like bells -- are fair game			0
in this place of garish , unnatural wonders and exotic fauna ( @entity127 turns up in the form of a diminutive winged monkey ) , the bewildered magician is swept off his feet by not one , but three magnificent witches -- @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 -- one after the other , each appealing to his better judgment and worst instincts , and none copping to the wickedness that we know will show its hand eventually			0
will our flawed hero measure up to the fix in which he finds himself ? and how , with nothing but an army of peaceniks to counter the witches ' @entity151 ? the new " @entity16 " falls short of the 1939 " @entity16 " in charm and innocence and certainly in songs ( there is only one , a brief , jokey number from the @entity159 )			1
but as family entertainment , it 's hard to fault such a rapturous spectacle and astute , suspenseful piece of storytelling			1
a true fantasist , @entity33 has conjured up a valentine to the imagination , to smoke and mirrors and to the movies as a magical space where we might envisage , and possibly even realize , our better selves			2
that 's more than good enough .			0

@entity33 's " @entity16 " is a prequel to " @entity13 "
instead of @entity1 , @entity59 's @entity13 is the focus
director @entity33 takes care to honor the original in spirit and style
critic : " @entity16 " is short on charm and innocence but astute and suspenseful
