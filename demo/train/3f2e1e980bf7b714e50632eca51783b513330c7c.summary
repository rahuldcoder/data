@entity0 -- a federal appeals court has slammed the reliability of @entity5 government intelligence documents , saying just because officials keep repeating their assertions does not make them true			1
a guard looks over the @entity5 military detention facility at @entity10 , @entity11 , in this file photo			0
a three - judge panel from the @entity14 in @entity0 likened the @entity17 administration 's case to a line in an 1876 nonsense poem by @entity20 : " i have said it thrice : what i tell you three times is true			1
" portions of the court 's findings were released a week ago , including a ruling that a @entity28 accused of being a foreign fighter was wrongly imprisoned			1
the full ruling was released monday			1
@entity31 is being held by the @entity5 military at the @entity33 in @entity11			1
in its ruling , the court ordered that @entity31 be released or transferred , or that a hearing be held quickly to determine whether he is being held properly			1
the judges criticized the government for offering unsubstantiated evidence , and referred to @entity20 's poem , " @entity40 , " in which the line is uttered by a pompous character called the @entity40			1
" the government suggests that several of the assertions in the intelligence documents are reliable because they are made in at least three different documents , " wrote judge @entity44			0
" we are not persuaded			0
@entity20 notwithstanding , the fact the government has ' said it thrice ' does not make the allegation true			1
in fact we have no basis for concluding that there are independent sources for the documents ' thrice - made assertions			0
" the court also ruled the military improperly labeled @entity31 as an " enemy combatant , " marking the first time a @entity10 detainee has been given an opportunity in a civilian court to seek his release			1
the decision throws into serious doubt the underlying reasons for keeping @entity71 in custody for more than six years			2
the @entity20 poem is similar to many of his other works , nonsensical in nature , described by the author as an account of " the impossible voyage of an improbable crew to find an inconceivable creature			1
" @entity20 , who lived from 1832 to 1898 , is best known for the children 's fantasy " @entity85			1
" the ruling came 18 days after the @entity87 concluded that the approximately 270 men held at @entity10 have a basic constitutional right to challenge their detention in federal courts , another setback for the @entity17 administration 's anti-terror and war policies			2
a different panel from the federal appeals court in @entity0 concluded last july that the @entity5 military could not limit what information the courts hear when foreign detainees are challenging their imprisonment			2
the government had argued national security concerns gave the military the discretion to decide what documents were pertinent for judicial review			0
lawyers for the @entity110 also claimed the lower court decision would " impose extraordinary compliance burdens			2
" about 180 detainees have appealed their continued imprisonment and complained the government is unfairly restricting access to evidence that could clear them of wrongdoing -- evidence the men may not even know exists			0
hearings known as combatant status review tribunals determine whether a prisoner can be designated an " enemy combatant , " and prosecuted by the military			0
some legal and military analysts have likened them to civilian grand jury proceedings			0
those who are designated as enemy combatants have restricted ability to challenge tribunal procedures and findings before the @entity134 federal appeals court under a federal law passed in 2006 , the @entity136			2
the legal issues surrounding the foreign nationals held in @entity5 custody have reached greater urgency in recent months			2
many of the men are in their seventh year of detention , and several have already had pretrial hearings before the military tribunal			0
@entity31 , a muslim of ethnic @entity148 descent , is accused of attending a terror training camp in @entity150 at the time of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
the @entity87 on three occasions since 2004 has limited the government 's power to detain and prosecute foreign nationals held at @entity10			2
federal judges in @entity0 have met with the prisoners ' lawyers in recent days , trying to coordinate an expected flood of appeals in the wake of the high court 's june 12 ruling			0
those judges are expected to meet privately among themselves , probably this week			0
the government has promised to comply with the justices ' latest ruling , but president @entity17 said he would still consider proposing further legislation limiting the power of federal courts to oversee appeals from enemy combatants			0
the case is @entity176 ( 06 - 1397 ) .			0

@entity178 in case of @entity28 held at @entity180
just because claim is repeated does *n't* make it true , court says , citing @entity20
*suspect* has been detained for six years , accused of attending terrorist training
@entity14 says he must be released , transferred , or get new hearing quickly
