just two weeks ago , @entity0 was regularly strapped into an explosive vest and handed a pistol , an @entity3 and a radio to stand guard at an @entity7 base in the eastern @entity9 city of @entity10			1
@entity0 -- not his real name -- is just 15 and an @entity7 child soldier			1
when we first met , he was clearly nervous , his hands slightly quivering as he picked up his cup of tea			2
understandable , given all he has been through and the twisted mental maze he is trying to navigate			2
@entity0 had followed his father to be with the @entity21 - linked @entity20			1
when @entity7 took over their area , father and son swore allegiance to @entity7			1
" i spent a month without seeing my family or anyone that i knew , " @entity0 recalls			1
" it was forbidden to see or speak to anyone			2
" he says there were about 100 children and for a month they were kept isolated from all that they knew and loved , and not allowed even to see or speak to their families			2
rather , they were entrenched in intense religious indoctrination			1
there were daily lessons on the violent and radical version of @entity37 practiced by @entity7			1
rigorous military training was also a daily feature of their lives			1
he says : " we used to crawl under webbing			0
there was fire above it , and we would be firing our weapons			0
we would jump through large metal rings and the trainers would be firing at our feet and telling us if we stop we will be shot			0
" he says the trainers would have them run for 2 kilometers			0
" i was very careful not to stop running , i did n't stop , even if i was exhausted , out of breath , i did n't stop			0
" @entity7 posts videos and pictures on the @entity56 bragging about its so - called " cubs of the @entity58			1
" while there are no firm numbers on how many children are part of @entity7 , the @entity59 says there are confirmed reports of children as young as 12 undergoing military training			1
@entity0 admits he missed his parents			1
it was the first time he had stayed away from them , but he says he and the other boys would laugh , joke and talk about their training			2
after a month he was sent home and began to regularly report for duty			0
" when we arrived they gave us guns and the explosive belt and the radio , " he says			0
" we would get calls from the checkpoints alerting us [ when ] the @entity82 were coming			0
anyone who was n't a vip , we would pick up our guns and stop them			0
" but his mother would beg him to leave			0
@entity0 says : " she would say that i am too young			1
' please leave , you have nothing to do with this			0
' i would tell her that this is the jihad that we all must do			0
" he says the first time he saw a beheading he did n't eat for two days , repulsed by the scene but not the actual act			0
he admits he was afraid the explosive belt he wore would accidentally detonate if he was hit by shrapnel			0
he also felt proud , strong and filled with a sense of purpose			0
but his father realized he had to save his son and himself			2
he decided to defect and tricked @entity102 into leaving with him for @entity103			1
@entity0 says : " i was asking him ' why are you doing this ? what happened ? ' my father turned to me and said they are not on the right religious track			1
" the @entity0 we met appears to have a gentle demeanor , but he 's clearly confused , struggling to define what is right and wrong , and wrest himself from the psychological damage @entity7 has done			1
he initially says he wants to go back to @entity7 because his friends are there , and he defends some of the strict interpretations of @entity37 , but he also says : " i am discovering over time they have no religion			2
" toward the end of our interview , he tells us he regrets having joined them			0
@entity0 has a chance to emerge from the hold of @entity7 , to return to the @entity124 and math - loving schoolboy he was before the war			1
but that is not the case for the other children firmly in the grasp of @entity7 , living under their rule , easily manipulated and lured toward the terrorist organization .			2

@entity0 , 15 , trained with @entity7 in @entity9
he had military training and religious indoctrination
his father helped him escape into @entity103
but now @entity0 is torn between school and returning to @entity7
