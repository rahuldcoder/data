-- the phenomenon of women choosing not to have children is afflicting the industrialized world in alarming numbers			2
@entity6 is steadily becoming more widespread , particularly in @entity8 - speaking countries but also in @entity9 and in much of @entity10			2
in 20 years , the number of childless women in many countries has doubled			1
in the lively debate that has followed the @entity16 publication of my book " the conflict , " much has been said and written about the pros and cons of breastfeeding and mothers staying at home			1
but this larger issue receives scant attention			0
in the @entity16 , where fertility rates remain high , 20 % of women are childless , which is twice as many as 30 years ago			1
there are an estimated 18 % in @entity8 , 20 % in @entity31 , and between 21 % and 26 % in @entity32			1
we do not have figures for childless @entity9 women , but we do know that @entity9 has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world , along with @entity32 , where it hovers at 1.3 children			1
although a minority of women choose not to have children , the trend constitutes a genuine revolution , pointing to some unspoken resistance to motherhood			1
as we know , as soon as women were able to control reproduction , pursue studies , enter the job market and aspire to financial independence , motherhood stopped being an inevitable , self - evident step and became a choice instead			1
whether we like it or not , motherhood is now only one important aspect of women 's identity , no longer the key to achieving a sense of self - fulfillment			2
and the rate at which women are saying no to children -- most notably among those with college education -- suggests that the choice , for many , threatens the other facets of their identity : their freedom , energy , income and professional accomplishments			2
no country can afford to ignore a decline in its birthrate			2
in the long term , a nation 's pension payments , power and very survival are at stake			0
to curb the drop in recent decades , some @entity10 governments have re-evaluated their family policies			0
@entity32 's example is especially instructive : although the state 's family policies are now among the most generous in @entity10 -- a parent who stays home with a child receives 67 % of his or her current net income for up to 12 months -- they have failed to boost the birthrate or reverse the figures for childless women			1
@entity32 's policies provide considerable financial help , but they essentially encourage mothers ( recent figures show that only 15 % of fathers take advantage of the leave ) to quit the work force			0
only an astonishing 14 % of @entity32 mothers with one child in fact resume full - time work			0
thus the family policies end up promoting the role of the father - provider , while mothers in effect feel the need to choose between family and work from the moment the first child is born , an especially risky proposition when one in three marriages ends in divorce			0
in this situation , where a high number of mothers are able to stay at home but the birthrate remains exceptionally low , the message is clear : women do not want policies that serve only to support mothers in their family life			1
for women to want children , they require policies that support the full range of their needs and roles and ambitions -- maternal , financial , professional			0
the varying @entity10 experiences show that the highest birthrates exist in the countries with the highest rates of working women			1
it is , therefore , in society 's interest to support working motherhood , which requires considerable public investment			0
generous leave is not , by itself , an incentive			0
to raise more than one child , a mother must have access to high - quality , full - day child care , but that is still not enough			0
income equality , flexible work hours and partners sharing family - related tasks -- these are the essential components that will allow women to be mothers without forgoing their other aspirations			0
tellingly , these are the rallying causes of traditional feminism , more pressing and relevant than ever			0
it turns out that profound feminist reform , in the workplace and in family policies , might just be what is needed to keep the birthrate from free fall			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			2
