@entity0 -- the @entity2 appeared ready to give government regulators the continuing authority to regulate profanity and sexual content on broadcast television after a lively hour of arguments tuesday			1
the justices and lawyers all stayed polite , not actually using any obscene words , preferring the legally acceptable " f - bomb " or " s - word " to describe the controversial content at issue in the high - stakes free speech dispute			2
the court will decide whether the @entity18 may constitutionally enforce its policies on " fleeting expletives " and scenes of nudity on television programs , both live and scripted			1
the agency had imposed hefty fines on broadcasters			0
in many televised instances , " one can not tell what is indecent and what is n't " said justice @entity31			1
" it 's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the @entity18 is defining indecency in concrete situations , " she added			1
but with so many programming choices on broadcast , cable and satellite tv , " all the government is asking for is a few ( broadcast ) channels where you can say -- they are not going to hear the s - word , the f - word			1
they are not going to see nudity , " chief justice @entity47 said			1
the court 's ruling , which will come in a few months , could establish important @entity53 guidelines over explicit content on the airwaves			1
the @entity56 had filed an appeal , and helpfully provided the justices with a dvd of a 2003 episode of the now - canceled " @entity61 " on @entity62 in which a naked woman was shown			0
the content of that program is central to the ongoing legal dispute			0
lawyer @entity67 representing @entity62 said the @entity18 's tough action against the network was " a shot out of the blue			1
" a federal appeals court last year for a second time struck down the government policies , concluding they were vague and inconsistently applied			1
pending fines against the broadcasters were dismissed			0
@entity62 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 are all parties in the case			0
controversial words and images have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the - air networks in the past eight years , dating back to when the @entity18 began considering a stronger , no - tolerance policy			1
the policy became known as the @entity87 , for singer @entity90 's 2003 acceptance speech at the live awards show on @entity78 , where he uttered the phrase " really , really , f --- ing brilliant			2
" the commission specifically cited celebrities @entity94 and @entity96 for potty - mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 @entity98 , which aired live on @entity79			0
@entity103 , in an apparent scripted moment said , " have you ever tried to get cow s -- t out of a @entity102 purse ? it 's not so f --- ing simple			2
" justice @entity106 dryly noted the language from the two women " seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary			2
" that drew laughter in the courtroom			0
the @entity77 complaint involved dirty language on " @entity117 , " a news and interview program			0
the high court two years ago ruled in favor of the @entity18 on the issue of " fleeting expletives , " concluding federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on broadcast tv networks airing isolated cases of profanity			1
the court , however , refused at the time to decide whether the commission 's policy violates the @entity53 guarantee of free speech , ruling only on the agency 's enforcement power			1
the justices ordered the free - speech aspect to be reviewed again by a @entity139 - based federal appeals court , which subsequently ruled in favor of the broadcasters			1
the @entity56 , in its new appeal , lumped both the expletives and nudity cases together , saying the court should decide the free speech questions as one			1
explicit language is heard with greater , albeit varying , frequency on cable television , the @entity152 , and satellite radio , which do not use public airwaves			0
but the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints of " indecent " language and images on broadcast television and radio , which is subject to greater regulation			1
that is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours , when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching			0
the commission formally reversed its policy in march 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal			0
in addition , a voluntary rating system is used by all television networks to warn viewers when material that might be offensive will be aired			2
much of the oral argument tuesday centered around the @entity62 television stations fined $ 27,500 each for airing the " @entity61 " episode featuring a woman with her breasts and buttocks exposed			0
" the episode is called ' @entity183			0
' it 's about the sexual awakening of a child , " @entity106 said			2
" the whole thing was titillating , " suggesting the @entity18 in this case could step in and declare it indecent			1
but justice @entity190 echoed the sentiments of the networks			2
" there is some amount of uncertainty , and @entity62 finds itself in that area of uncertainty , " she said			0
" because it turns out that nudity -- sometimes it 's allowed as to some body parts and sometimes it 's not allowed -- and the commission had n't really said anything about it for 50 years , " until the clampdown a decade ago			1
the networks complain the @entity18 allowed profanity in such movies as " @entity207 , " and full - frontal nudity in " @entity209 " when they aired on broadcast tv , but fined stations for other allegedly " indecent " material			1
" context matters , " said @entity47 , skeptical about what he was hearing from the networks			1
" people understand that , including children			0
when they hear a bad word when someone hits their thumb with a hammer , they understand that 's different than having an adult stand in normal conversations and use the words			2
and it seems to me that your position is saying that the government can not regulate with an understanding of what takes place in the real world			2
" another source of contention is whether broadcast radio and the tv networks -- @entity62 , @entity77 , @entity79 , @entity78 , and the @entity243 -- should receive treatment differing from their satellite and cable cousins , in a content way			1
most broadcast stations are part of the basic cable packages people buy , and just 10 % of the population receives its tv only through the airwaves			1
but the government countered that 69 million television sets are not connected to cable or satellite , and that broadcasting is the medium of choice for children			2
" what do you call it , you surf through all the ( cable ) channels			2
and it 's not apparent to many people which are broadcast and which are not , " justice @entity267 said to solicitor general @entity268 , who argued for the @entity18			1
" but you 're saying that there 's still a value , an importance , in having a higher standard or different standard for broadcast media on the television			1
why is that , when there are so many other options ? " justice @entity291 : " sign me up as supporting @entity267 's notion that this has a symbolic value , just as we require a certain modicum of dress for the people that attend this court			1
... if these are public airwaves , the government is entitled to insist upon a certain modicum of decency			1
" but @entity31 interjected : " the expletives are in common parlance today			1
i think that the children are not going to be shocked by them the way they might have been a generation ago			0
" @entity190 suggested the broadcast regulatory model has been around since the 1920s			2
" it seems to work and it seems to be a good thing that there is some safe haven , even if the old technological bases for that safe haven do n't exist anymore			2
" justice @entity312 went further , saying the whole broadcast debate may be moot in a few years			1
" @entity314 is living on borrowed time			0
it is not going to be long before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight - track tapes , " he told the network lawyers			0
" i 'm sure your clients will continue to make billions of dollars on their programs which are transmitted by cable and by satellite and by @entity152			0
but to the extent they are making money from people who are using rabbit ears ( antennas ) , that is disappearing			0
" @entity268 warned that without the current regulations , viewers would see only more profanity and nudity			0
" the risk of the race to the bottom is real , and i think history is showing it			0
" there were flashes of humor throughout			0
when @entity67 noted viewer complaints after a recent @entity348 , showing a female statue -- " very much like some of the statues that are here in this courtroom , that had bare breasts and buttocks " -- several justices began looking about in search of the artwork			0
" right over here , @entity291 , " said @entity67 , pointing to a carved frieze atop the courtroom showing legal figures , including a bare - breasted symbol of justice			0
everyone enjoyed that moment of levity			0
the @entity2 first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978 , when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian @entity369 on society 's taboo surrounding " seven dirty words			1
" the bit had received some radio airplay			0
the justices said " context " should be applied when deciding whether words or images are " indecent			0
" the major broadcast television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity , racy images or expletives , even after 10 p.m. , when some potentially vulgar words are permitted			1
@entity386 -- the parent company of @entity1 -- filed a supporting amicus brief in the high court dispute two years ago			0
the company is part owner of the @entity243 broadcast network and operates several cable networks			0
the case is @entity18 v. @entity394 ( 10 - 1293 ) .			2

new : justice *scalia* : " the government is entitled to insist upon a ... modicum of decency "
the court looks at whether the @entity18 can limit expletives and nudity on broadcast tv
sometimes it 's hard to tell " what is indecent and what is n't , " @entity31 says
the @entity18 just wants a few channels free of such material , chief justice @entity47 says
