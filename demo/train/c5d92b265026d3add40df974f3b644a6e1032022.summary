-- @entity7 's " @entity6 " is now actually one man , played by @entity2 , one near - man , played by @entity4 , and one manchild			1
that would be @entity9 , who made his debut monday night on the @entity12 sitcom as @entity13			1
@entity13 is nearly the opposite of @entity16 's now - dead sleaze king @entity15 : sweet , unsarcastic but -- here we stay true to the show 's gawping bawdiness -- possessed of an astounding anatomical endowment that he soon puts to use			1
the instant verdict : @entity9 was not at all bad			1
first , though , we must dispose of the corpse			0
i think if creator @entity26 could have had all the cast and crew come out shrieking and tear apart a lifelike effigy of departed star @entity16 , with blood and viscera and intestines tossed into a vat of hot oil , he would have			1
it 's not as if anyone would blame @entity26 : @entity16 's outrageous behavior earlier this year left a top - rated sitcom without a completed season , without an anchor -- and , regardless of how you regard @entity16 personally , without one of the best sitcom actors in prime time			1
and so the first half of the episode practically danced with sadistic , vengeful glee in explaining how @entity16 's character , the irredeemably low - life womanizer @entity15 , had perished : at a memorial service , @entity49 ( the very funny @entity50 ) hinted that she had shoved him under the @entity53 after she caught him cheating during their honeymoon			1
" his body just exploded , " she said , " like a balloon full of meat			0
" the only memories @entity61 's many lovers shared were about the sexually transmitted diseases he 'd given them , and one woman regretted not being able to spit on the body			2
none of this was funny			0
it probably was n't supposed to be			0
it was a shiv , and it was being stuck in @entity16			1
@entity71 then @entity9 showed up as @entity13 , sopping wet from having tried to drown himself over a broken heart			1
( he gave up , he said , because the water was too cold			0
) with his long hair , scruffy beard and hippie - dippy , somewhat stupid sincerity , he seemed at first to have wandered in from a production of @entity79			2
except that , as mentioned , he is apparently better endowed than @entity81 and , unlike mr. @entity16 , possesses a body that can be paraded around naked with a preening , unembarrassed confidence			1
he 's very nearly a character out of porn			0
did you think you were tuning in to " @entity88 ? " and the fact is that @entity9 , despite having spent so much time over the past few years branding and tweeting himself , is a good comic actor			1
his limit may be that he knows how to play a doofus while subtly reminding us that he really is n't -- he likes to clown , but he probably does n't want to be a clown			0
his self - love may not allow that			0
@entity16 , on the other hand , had the cold toughness of loathing , anger and regret , a comic style almost radical ( for prime time ) in its thin ash of contempt			2
true comedy does n't require a smiley face			0
how else could @entity16 have managed to sell tickets for something called the @entity113 ? but you see where we are now : @entity9 on @entity16 's old sitcom			1
@entity16 , appearing on the @entity117 , wishing all the best for " @entity6 , " seemingly purged of his acidic irony			2
it was like watching the @entity121 from @entity122 's " 1984 " after @entity123 got through with him			0
@entity9 is the one known for punking			2
@entity16 , one might say , is the one who ended up punk 'd			2
