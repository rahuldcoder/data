outgoing speaker @entity47 , who presided over the chamber for the conclusion of wednesday 's vote , said the discussion was " about holy and sacred ground			2
" @entity55 sen. @entity54 , who acknowledged that approval of the bill was in doubt until a few hours before the vote , called it a " great day " for the nation -- and especially for first responders sickened by exposure to toxic pollution from the collapse of the @entity67 towers , because now they know their country will take care of them			1
in @entity55 , outgoing @entity17 gov. @entity70 said the bill " will provide much - needed funds for medical treatment to the rescue workers and residents of @entity55 who suffered illnesses from breathing in toxic fumes , dust and smoke from ground zero			1
" he said it also reopens the victims ' compensation fund for rescue workers who were hurt as a result of the attacks			0

" " it was a lot of time and a lot of effort and it 's a little disappointing to see something like this only now receive the bipartisan support that it should have received from the beginning , " @entity96 said			0
negotiations wednesday morning involving @entity54 and fellow @entity17 sen. @entity111 of @entity55 with @entity113 sens. @entity112 of @entity114 and @entity115 of @entity116 led to a deal that reduced the cost of the bill by $ 2 billion and made other changes sought by @entity113 opponents , according to statements by the participants			1
" the @entity128 we 've been looking for has arrived , " said a statement issued by @entity54 and @entity111 , adding : " we are pleased to announce that we crafted an agreement that will allow this legislation to pass the @entity9 , and the @entity8 , this afternoon			1
we thank our @entity113 friends for coming together to fulfill @entity131 's moral obligation to the heroes of 9/11			2
" @entity112 , a conservative who led the opposition to the bill , said the agreement produced a better piece of legislation			2
" every @entity131 recognizes the heroism of the 9/11 first responders , but it is not compassionate to help one group while robbing future generations of opportunity , " said @entity112 , who had demanded that the cost of the bill be lowered and fully paid for			1
" i 'm pleased this agreement strikes a fair balance and improves the bill the majority attempted to rush through at the last minute			2
" according to @entity112 , the agreement reduces the overall cost of the bill by $ 2 billion to a total of $ 4.2 billion over a 10 - year period			0
his statement said that $ 1.5 billion of the cost goes for health benefits and $ 2.7 billion will pay for compensation for health problems of emergency responders			0
the agreement also caps attorneys ' fees at 10 percent of any total compensation award , and includes potential limits on compensation for individuals who already have received workers compensation for injuries due to the 9/11 response , the @entity112 statement said			0
@entity17 previously agreed to pay for the bill with fees collected on various services involving foreign countries and foreign visitors			0
on tuesday , @entity54 said it appeared the bill would come up for a @entity9 vote once lawmakers voted on @entity178 , a nuclear arms control pact with @entity179 that is one of @entity10 's top foreign policy priorities			1
both votes occurred wednesday afternoon			0
the @entity183 is named after a deceased @entity185 detective who had worked in the toxic plume at ground zero			0
the @entity8 earlier passed the previous version of the bill on a mostly partisan 268 - 160 vote			1
according to the bill 's supporters , it is funded by a procurement fee on some foreign countries that trade with the @entity131 , the continuation of a fee on some travelers to the @entity131 and a fee on visas for some companies			1
the version being negotiated by the senators wednesday drops some of those funding sources			0
on tuesday , a group of 9/11 first responders joined lawmakers in @entity0 to urge the @entity9 to pass the health care bill			2
" we continue to see our friends die on a day - to - day basis , " said @entity209 , a @entity55 police officer who said he is sick with lung disease			0
" we 're asking for the right to live			0
" in the years following the attacks , health experts have noted respiratory and mental health conditions , such as post-traumatic stress disorder , in those who engaged in ground zero rescue and cleanup efforts			2
