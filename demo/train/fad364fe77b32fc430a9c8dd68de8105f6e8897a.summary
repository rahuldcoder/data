@entity0 -- the @entity2 has not attempted to recoup some $ 643 million in payments that were improperly given to 160,000 individuals for housing and other aid following @entity8 and @entity9 , an independent government investigator says			1
in a letter to @entity2 administrator @entity13 , inspector general @entity11 wrote that a federal court in 2008 ordered @entity2 to change its process for recovering the money			1
but monday , three years after that court ruling , " these payments remain uncollected because your office has not given final approval of a new recoupment process , " @entity11 wrote			1
following the back - to - back storms in 2005 , @entity2 disbursed more than $ 7 billion in assistance to survivors			1
at the time , the government placed a premium on distributing the money quickly because of the dire needs of residents of the @entity30			0
the money was intended for rental assistance , home repairs , housing replacement , moving costs , medical costs and other individual assistance			0
but in the storm 's wake , @entity2 estimated that approximately $ 643 million of the payments were improper due to human error and fraud			1
early efforts to recover the money were themselves flawed , and in june of 2007 , a federal judge ordered @entity2 to discontinue its debt collection until changes were made to the process			1
@entity2 immediately complied , @entity11 wrote , and in 2008 the agency announced that it was stopping its recoupment of improper disaster payments until it could establish new procedures			2
@entity2 also announced it would review each case of suspected fraud to confirm the validity of the debt			2
but , @entity11 wrote , @entity2 's new recovery process has been awaiting approval by the administrator since late 2008			2
while @entity2 has established a strategy , identified the necessary staff and initiated a review of the 160,000 cases , " your office has not instructed the responsible parties to restart the recoupment process , " @entity11 wrote to @entity13			0
" further delay only makes aging debts more difficult to collect , " @entity11 wrote			0
in a statement to @entity1 , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity71 said @entity2 is " committed to being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars			0
" " not only do we agree with the inspector general 's recommendation to recoup disaster assistance payments that were improperly disbursed ... but we are and have been actively working with state and local leadership and other stakeholders to finalize plans to recoup misspent funds , while continuing to support @entity30 communities as they recover , " she said			2
" under our current leadership , we have worked diligently to put protections in place that will safeguard against fraud and abuse , significantly reduce the percentage of improper payments , and develop a fair , open and transparent process for recovering these payments , " @entity71 said			1
@entity71 said she did not have a date for when @entity13 would authorize collection of debts , but said , " we are well underway in taking the steps we need to begin this new process			0
" in @entity11 's letter to @entity13 , @entity11 wrote @entity13 should " promptly take action " to recover the money			0
noting that president @entity102 signed a presidential memorandum in march of 2010 asking departments to identify and reclaim misspent funds , @entity11 said @entity13 should " promptly authorize the collection of this debt , " he wrote .			0
