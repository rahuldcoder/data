@entity0 -- president @entity2 of @entity3 arrived in @entity0 on friday ahead the 15th anniversary of the territory 's handover from @entity7 , an event likely to bring into focus the city 's complex feelings about @entity13 's influence			1
@entity0 has prospered since its last @entity7 governor , @entity14 , bade the territory a tearful farewell on july 1 , 1997			1
it has benefited from its position as a financial and commercial gateway to @entity3 , riding the mainland 's spectacular economic boom of the past two decades			2
but the economic rewards have been mixed with unease about @entity13 's intentions for @entity0 in the longer term , with concerns about possible threats to freedom of speech and the rule of law			1
some @entity31 have also expressed reservations about the effect that mainland @entity3 people are having on property prices and public services in the city			1
nonetheless , @entity0 has its own borders and immigration control , even with @entity3			1
it has its own currency , its own police force and system of law courts			0
it has freedom of expression and demonstration to a degree unheard of anywhere on the mainland			0
this nuanced situation is expected to be reflected during @entity2 's three - day visit			1
he stepped off an @entity54 plane friday onto a red carpet to be welcomed by a people wearing red caps and waving @entity3 flags			2
the outgoing @entity0 chief executive , @entity59 , greeted @entity2 at @entity60 , the state - run @entity3 news agency @entity61 reported			1
also present were other senior officials from the territory , notably the @entity13 - backed chief executive - elect of @entity0 , @entity65			1
@entity65 , who has long - standing ties to the mainland , is set to take office on sunday in @entity2 's presence			1
the @entity3 president is scheduled to attend a string of other events over the next three days , including a flag - raising ceremony , a firework display and a parachute jump by members of the @entity78			2
protesters have said they will follow @entity2 throughout his visit in order to bring attention to human rights abuses in @entity3			1
they are planning a big demonstration on sunday afternoon			0
one particularly sensitive issue for the protesters is the death this month of @entity88 , a high - profile dissident who had spent more than 20 years in jail following his support of the @entity92 student protests in 1989			0
@entity88 was found hanging in his hospital room in @entity94 , @entity95 , on june 6			0
the local authorities said he had committed suicide , a claim that friends of the deaf and blind labor rights activist have contested			0
@entity0 government officials have also questioned whether @entity88 could have committed suicide			0
the @entity3 authorities are now investigating his death			0
the weather is also threatening to disrupt @entity2 's visit			2
@entity106 was heading across the @entity107 on friday toward the the @entity3 coast near @entity0 , according to the @entity109			2
the storm is expected to hit land overnight			0
@entity1 's @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 has prospered since @entity7 handed it over to @entity3 in 1997
however , some @entity31 are concerned about @entity13 's intentions
president @entity2 arrives in the territory at the start of a three - day visit
he will mark the handover 's anniversary but also be the focus of protests
