-- two movies that pushed limits -- " boyhood " and " birdman " -- were among the leaders for the @entity7 nominations			1
the nominations were announced wednesday morning			1
" boyhood " was filmed over the course of 12 years and followed its lead , @entity11 , from the age of 6 through his adolescence			1
the film , which was nominated for best ensemble -- the @entity18 ' equivalent of @entity20 's best picture -- also earned nominations for @entity22 and @entity23 , who play @entity11 's parents			1
thanks to some technical wizardry , " birdman " looks as if it consists of a single shot , showing @entity30 as a once high - flying superhero actor who 's trying to rebuild his career with a @entity34 play			1
@entity30 , who has earned wide praise for his performance , earned a best male actor nomination , @entity39 received a best supporting male actor nod , and @entity41 , who plays @entity30 's daughter , picked up a nod for best supporting female actor			2
the film was nominated for best ensemble			1
one of @entity41 's fan @entity47 accounts picked up on the nomination right away and congratulated her co-stars			2
" congrats to @entity30 & @entity39 on their # sagawards nominations # @entity55 , " tweeted @entity52			1
" @entity58 , " a biopic about physicist and mathematician @entity60 , received three nominations			1
other nominees for best ensemble include " @entity63 " and " @entity64			1
" complete list of nominees the @entity18 are closely watched by awards season observers since they provide an early indication of what the performers themselves -- who make up the largest bloc of @entity73 voters -- believe are the top performances of the year			1
as such , they 're noted as much for what did n't make it as for what did			2
" @entity88 , " the drama about the 1965 civil rights march , was shut out , as was " unbroken , " the @entity83 - directed version of @entity85 's bestselling book about prisoner of war @entity86			2
nomination highlights on the other hand , the @entity18 are n't kidding when they highlight ensembles , which may be one reason that @entity94 's " @entity64 " -- a film bursting with colorful cameos -- was included among the best ensemble nominees , though its lead , @entity98 , did n't get a best male actor nomination			1
other films received plaudits for specific performances			0
though " @entity103 , " a drama about troubled heir @entity105 , did n't get an ensemble nomination , both @entity107 -- who plays du pont -- and @entity109 did earn nods for their performances			0
" @entity116 , " about a brutal music instructor and his student , received a nomination for @entity114 ' performance as the instructor			0
twitterer @entity119 was already wondering whether @entity114 was going to go all the way			0
" is there any hope for any other supporting actor outside of # @entity125 for # @entity126 for the @entity20 ? ? ? " she tweeted			0
perennial awards frontrunner @entity127 did not disappoint , picking up a nomination for her performance as the @entity131 in " @entity132			0
" it was the film 's only nomination			0
@entity136 's creepy performance as a videographer in " @entity138 " was also recognized			0
@entity139 did particularly well in the @entity18 nominations			1
not only is he up in two categories -- best male actor in a film for " @entity63 " and best male actor in a miniseries or tv movie for " @entity147 : the last vow " -- " @entity63 " itself snagged a pick for ensemble			1
@entity109 , who was nominated for " @entity103 " and @entity153 's " @entity152 , " pulled off the same trick			2
@entity107 was quick to congratulate him			0
" congratulations @ markruffalo on his two @ @entity157 nominations ! " he tweeted			2
and @entity159 , who has n't been on many handicappers ' sheets , earned a best female actor nomination for her performance in the little - seen " cake			0
" she plays a woman in a chronic pain support group who looks into the death of a cohort			0
" this is the best 6:00 a.m. wake up call ever			0
words ca n't describe how blessed i feel to be recognized like this by my peers for this film			0
what an enormous feeling of joy and gratitude , " @entity159 said in a statement			0
' @entity180 , ' ' @entity181 ' among tv nominees the @entity18 also go out to tv shows , and the list of comedies and dramas wo n't surprise anybody who watches the @entity188			1
the nominees for best ensemble in a drama are " @entity192 , " " @entity193 , " " @entity181 , " " @entity194 " and " @entity195			1
" the nominees for best ensemble in a comedy are " @entity198 , " " @entity199 , " " @entity200 , " " @entity201 " and " @entity202			1

picking among dramas will be particularly hard , tweeted @entity218			0
in a response to a question from @entity0 's @entity222 account , she said , " awwwww crap three really great shows i love up for the same award			2
" @entity226 and @entity227 made the announcement of the nominations wednesday			2
