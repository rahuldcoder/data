the announcement that @entity2 , the 26 - year - old held by @entity4 , has been killed has thrust the question of how -- and whether -- to negotiate with extremists back into the spotlight			1
@entity2 's grace , demonstrated in the letter she wrote to her family while being held by the @entity4 , was inspiring			1
and although the letter was clearly written under duress , that duress could not diminish the strength and beauty of her spirit			2
i 'm thankful that i found out about her , but i 'm also angry at how i did			2
i am , of course , not alone in being outraged by @entity4 ' recent spate of hostage - taking and executions			1
and that raises another interesting question : is @entity4 miscalculating ? it goes without saying that the so - called @entity27 is no more about @entity28 than the @entity29 were about @entity30			1
they are about self - aggrandizement and shocking sensationalism			1
they trade human beings for money , weapons and most importantly , publicity			1
but @entity4 found themselves in over their heads with the reaction in the @entity42 to how they murdered @entity43 , the @entity45 pilot -- burning him alive in a cage			1
previously , the group had been successful at using its murder videos for recruitment -- every outcast in the world seemed a little jealous of the masked miscreant nicknamed " @entity53			2
" in contrast , @entity43 's death brought down swift and powerful condemnation of @entity4 and its tactics from across the @entity59 world			1
yet even as @entity4 were broadcasting video of the pilot 's killing , they were also trying to figure out how to deal themselves out of the situation they found themselves in with @entity2			1
after all , holding a @entity66 female humanitarian aid worker is a delicate negotiation , even for the seasoned commodities dealers that @entity4 have become			1
indeed , there was a similar episode back in 2004 , when the group 's mentors , @entity71 in @entity72 , held humanitarian aid worker @entity75			0
the courageous @entity76 was ultimately murdered by her captors , but the backlash to her death was also swift			0
there is , simply , no good way to spin murdering a woman who is n't your enemy , who has done you no harm and who has actually done a great deal of good for those in a region you profess to represent			0
and spin is what this is all about ; if there is the potential for good publicity , then there is also the potential for some very bad publicity			2
so what do the opportunistic serial killers masquerading behind masks and a religion do ? they see the @entity45 retaliation as an opportunity to rid themselves of a commodity they do n't know what to do with			0
but the idea that a @entity45 bomb would somehow kill only a hostage and none of their oddball lot is ridiculous			0
and reading between the carefully worded statements by the @entity119 , it is clear that our government is not buying this story that @entity4 peddled , either			1
but what should our government be doing now ? for a start , it must recognize that this battle is not just on the ground , it 's three - dimensional			2
@entity4 is telling us they care very deeply about their pr , otherwise they would n't work so hard at it			1
but it is also important to realize that the most dangerous negotiation is the one you do n't know you 're in			0
with that in mind , we should remember that @entity4 started negotiating with the world with their first video -- they just do n't want you to know that 's what they 're doing			2
instead , they hope the debates veer off into a debate over whether this is a conflict of @entity59 versus @entity141			0
and every single time anyone in the western world wonders publicly why @entity145 nations are n't being more vocal in condemning @entity4 , we play into their hands			2
whatever validity you think that argument has , it 's hard not to feel a little uncomfortable that we are even engaging in the very debate and discussion that the enemy wants us to			0
and on the issue of hostage taking specifically ? after about a year of slowly getting familiar with the @entity158 government 's actual policy on kidnapping , our policy implementers are finding out that it is actually quite good			0
the policy says , in essence , that we 're not afraid to talk to anybody			0
president @entity164 once said we should never negotiate out of fear , yet we should never fear to negotiate			0
i 'd suggest taking that principle one step further : we do n't negotiate with terrorists			0
we negotiate against them .			0
