@entity0 -- @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 said thursday that @entity11 's new leader , @entity10 , " has a choice to make " -- become a " transformative leader " or continue the @entity7 nation 's existing policies , which she predicted would lead to its demise			1
" he can continue the model of the past and eventually @entity11 will change , because at some point people can not live under such oppressive conditions -- starving to death , being put into gulags and having their basic human rights denied , " she said			0
" we are hoping that he will chart a different course for his people			0
" the 29 - year - old @entity10 became @entity11 's most powerful figure about six months ago , following the death of his father @entity26			1
he has only made two public speeches since rising to power -- the first coming at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity11 's founder and his grandfather @entity33 , and more recently in june in a speech to about 20,000 children			2
referring to @entity10 , @entity38 expressed " hope that the new leadership in @entity41 will live up to its agreements , will not engage in threats and provocations ( and ) will put the @entity11 people first			1
" " rather than spending money on implements of war , feed your people , provide education and health care , and lift your people out of poverty and isolation , " she advised @entity11 's new leader			1
the comments followed a meeting in @entity0 -- referred to by both sides as the " 2 - plus - 2 " talks -- involving @entity38 , @entity3 defense secretary @entity60 and @entity62 's foreign and defense ministers			1
afterward , the @entity3 and @entity62 released a joint statement reaffirming their cooperation on security matters , an alliance they called " a linchpin of stability , security , and prosperity in the @entity72 and increasingly around the world			1
" that cooperation was evident in crisis management and " intelligence sharing " before , during and after @entity11 's failed long - range rocket launch in april , @entity62 defense minister @entity74 said thursday			1
some expressed concerns that launch , which the @entity82 condemned as a " serious violation " of previous council resolutions , might signal @entity41 's intentions to fire nuclear weapons on its foes			0
foreign minister @entity88 promised that @entity62 and the @entity3 " will show a decisive response " if @entity11 moves to " provoke again			2
" yet he also opened the door for talks			0
" the road to dialogue and cooperation is open should @entity11 stop its provocation , " he said			0
a few years after the @entity97 was divided after @entity98 , @entity3 forces joined @entity62 in the @entity99 -- a conflict that ended in a cease - fire , but no peace treaty			0
@entity11 's nuclear weapons capabilities have further heightened tensions in recent years			2
this week 's meeting in @entity0 showed the strength of the partnership between two of @entity11 's staunchest foes			2
in addition to a continued focus on @entity41 's nuclear and missile programs , the two parties announced a joint defense initiative focused on " evolving threats , such as in space , the maritime domain , and cyberspace , " according to the joint statement			0
" working together , we can improve the security of our government , military and commercial infrastructure and better protect against cyber attacks , " @entity38 said .			0
