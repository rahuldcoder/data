so much for old - fashioned air conditioning : what if you could harness the universe to cool your house ? some @entity6 engineers may have figured out how to do just that			1
according to a paper in the scientific journal nature , a team led by @entity6 electrical engineer @entity11 has come up with a material that can radiate heat away from buildings and send it directly into space			1
the wafer - thin material -- just 1.8 microns thick , about 50 times thinner than a piece of paper -- is made up of layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide on top of a layer of silver			2
it both acts as a mirror , reflecting sunlight back into space , and channels invisible , heat - bearing infrared rays away from the source and into the universe			1
" think about it like having a window into space , " fan told the @entity36			2
the @entity6 team calls it " photonic radiative cooling , " and if the material is applied to surfaces such as rooftops , it could help lower the need for air conditioning			1
in tests , the material was capable of cooling a surface by 5 degrees @entity49 ( about 9 degrees @entity50 )			2
" this team has shown how to passively cool structures by simply radiating heat into the cold darkness of space , " @entity51 - winning physicist @entity52 , a @entity6 professor emeritus , told the @entity36			1
the scientists note that air conditioning currently accounts for about 15 % of energy usage in buildings			0
moreover , in rural and undeveloped areas , the material could provide a cooling technology that does n't require electricity , observes @entity65 , who was part of the research team			0
" across the developing world , photonic radiative cooling makes off - grid cooling a possibility in rural regions , in addition to meeting skyrocketing demand for air conditioning in urban areas , " he told the @entity36			0
there are still obstacles , of course			0
the team believes production of the material can be ramped up into rooftop - appropriate sizes , but right now it exists only as a relatively small prototype			0
moreover , the researchers are uncertain how to conduct heat from a building 's interior to the material so it can be sent into space			1
but the scientists are optimistic			0
after all , the universe is vast and very , very cold : about 3 degrees above absolute zero , to be precise			0
radiating our heat directly into space could help solve a number of problems on @entity98 , @entity11 told the @entity36			1
" every object that produces heat has to dump that heat into a heat sink , " he said			0
" what we 've done is to create a way that should allow us to use the coldness of the universe as a heat sink during the day			2

@entity6 scientists create material that radiates heat into space
material is *ultrathin* and acts as both mirror and infrared radiator
if applied to building rooftops , could help lower *temperature* *significantly*
