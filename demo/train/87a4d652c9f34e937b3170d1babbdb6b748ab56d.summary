a federal investigation has not found enough evidence to charge @entity3 for depriving @entity4 of his civil rights , according to multiple sources familiar with the probe			1
this would be the second time the former police officer has avoided standing trial in the black teen 's fatal shooting last summer in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the @entity16 joined local officials in interviewing more than 200 people -- and looked at much the same evidence -- as a @entity21 grand jury that decided in november not to indict @entity3 , who is white , on any charges in @entity4 's death			1
that federal law enforcement agency has now completed its investigation into the august shooting and sent its findings to the @entity28 , a law enforcement official and a separate @entity31 official said wednesday			2
based on that probe , @entity28 prosecutors wo n't recommend civil rights charges against @entity3 because there is not sufficient evidence to support them , a @entity31 official told @entity1			1
the @entity38 first reported the development wednesday			0
the @entity28 report has not been completed , and attorney general @entity41 ultimately will make the final decision whether to press federal civil rights charges against @entity3			1
still , it would n't be a surprise if @entity41 does n't call for charges			2
while he 's been outspoken on @entity14 , met with @entity4 's family and said he understood @entity49 - @entity31 ' mistrust for police after the incident , the attorney general acknowledged in november that " federal civil rights law imposes a high legal bar in these types of cases			1
" the shooting of the 18 - year - old @entity4 stirred months of emotionally charged , widespread and at times violent demonstrations in @entity14 , a few miles northwest of @entity58			1
" hands up , do n't shoot " became a mantra for protesters nationwide decrying what they called undue , unfair police violence against african - americans , resonating even after grand jury testimony disputed whether @entity4 ever actually raised his arms in surrender			1
those protests bubbled up in the days immediately after the shooting , with anger growing due to what some saw as law enforcement 's heavy - handed response			2
and they swelled again after the grand jury 's decision this fall not to indict @entity3 on state charges			1
if @entity41 decides , based on prosecutors ' recommendation , not to press federal civil rights charges against @entity3 , that could rile things up yet again			1
@entity81 , a @entity58 city alderman who has been involved in the @entity14 protests , thinks some people will be disappointed , at the least			0
" the community and the family wanted a day in court , an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out , cross-examined , " @entity81 said			0
" and it looks like that 's not going to happen			0
i hope we do n't have any violence as a result of this			0
" for now , though , @entity4 's family is laying low			1
what are the @entity4 family 's options ? @entity102 , a lawyer for the family , has said he felt federal civil rights charges against @entity3 were " not very likely " given the " very high standard " that has to be met			1
@entity1 senior legal analyst @entity106 has noted that authorities would need proof that @entity3 exhibited " racial hostility , " presumably by what he said before , during or after the shooting			1
the @entity4 camp deferred comment on wednesday 's news reports suggesting there would be no charges			1
" the family of @entity4 will wait for official word from the @entity28 regarding whether or not any charges will be filed against the police officer who shot and killed him , " @entity102 said in a written statement			1
" the family wo n't address speculation from anonymous sources			2
" even without charges , this story is n't over			2
it 's possible that @entity4 's family will file a civil lawsuit against @entity3 , who resigned in late november citing security concerns			1
and the @entity28 still has another open investigation -- this one looking at the @entity132 as a whole			0
" anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in @entity14 that has received a good deal of attention , " @entity41 said in september			0
" our investigation will assess the police department 's use of force , including deadly force			2
it will analyze stops , searches and arrests			0
and it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at @entity14 's city jail			0
" that investigation could lead to significant changes in @entity14 , much as similar federal probes have produced in @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and elsewhere			0
but it would n't mean charges for @entity3 , personally , or that anyone would go on trial			1
it 's also possible there could be legislation , policy changes or personnel turnovers not forced by the federal government			2
in his state of the state speech on wednesday , @entity15 gov. @entity171 said addressing " the broader , systemic issues " raised by the unrest that followed the killing of @entity4 would demand " sustained effort			2
" " the legacy of @entity14 will be determined by what we do next ... to foster healing and hope ... and the changes we make to strengthen all of our communities , " he said			0
at the least , @entity81 said , he expects more protests to keep up pressure on authorities			0
" that 's a good thing , " he said			0
" but we want to keep them peaceful , nonviolent because violence makes the situation worse			0
it divides the community in a time we need to come together and make everyone feel like they can get equal protection			0
" ultimately , he said , some of the protesters ' goals can be achieved outside the courts			0
" the next steps i think are legislative change , " @entity81 said , " trying to make sure that in cases like this we get a special prosecutor by law , and to create a new level of civilian oversight over police departments			0
" @entity1 's @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 contributed to this report .			0
