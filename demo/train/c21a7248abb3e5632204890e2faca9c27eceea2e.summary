@entity0 -- it is one of a handful global landmarks that needs no introduction			1
the @entity6 in @entity0 is an @entity8 icon and a relic that dates back to the first century @entity10 -- lions , gladiators , chariots and all			1
but with so many historic landmarks to care for -- like the @entity6 , the @entity16 and the @entity17 -- @entity8 is beginning to struggle to manage its vast portfolio alone			1

problems regarding funding started during the global financial crisis a little over five years ago			0
in 2014 alone , the city of @entity0 ran a deficit of over $ 1 billion dollars and required a federal decree to bail it out			2
these budgetary issues are complicated further by social and professional movements pressuring their representatives elected representatives on a number of issues such as pay and public services			0
on the sprightly spring day that @entity1 visited the @entity0 , junior doctors were on the streets seeking a pay hike			1
there are some , however , who say that if there is any hope of bringing back the days of " @entity63 , " @entity8 needs to bundle its history with what the world sees as the @entity8 lifestyle			2
it is here that the private sector has begun to play its part			0
according to @entity74 , owner of high end shoemaker , @entity73 's , the nation 's biggest companies have a responsibility to maintain @entity8 monuments as they are all part of the same brand experience			1
@entity80 , as he is known , is spending $ 34 million on a five year scrubbing of the travertine marble front of the @entity6			0
" the most important things is the tourist project ... ( or ) if you want we call it the made in @entity8 project , " @entity74 said			0
elsewhere , @entity89 is putting $ 2 million into the @entity16 while fashion house @entity90 has offered up nearly $ 3 million for the equally famous @entity92			0
