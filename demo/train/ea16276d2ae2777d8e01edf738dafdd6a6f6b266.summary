what 's more , these officials said some 3,526 patients at the @entity5 still " may be at risk " for receiving poor urologic care , according to an ongoing investigation by the @entity4 's office			1
the problems of very long wait lists for veterans and serious scheduling issues go well beyond @entity28 and exist in many va facilities , inspector general @entity21 and members of his staff told the @entity30			1
nearly 70 @entity5 hospitals or clinics have " knowingly and willingly " altered or manipulated their wait lists and schedules to obscure problems , testified dr. @entity36 , assistant inspector general for health care inspections			1

" i am committed to fixing this problem and providing timely , high - quality care that veterans have earned and that they desire , " @entity47 said			1
" that 's how we regain veterans trust , and that 's how we regain your trust and the trust of the @entity69 people			2
" tuesday 's hearing was prompted by an @entity4 report released late last month , examining the situation in @entity28 and also across the @entity5 system			1
that report found 28 veterans who suffered " clinically significant delays in care associated with access to care or patient scheduling			2
" and of those 28 patients , six died			2
in addition the report found 17 other " care deficiencies that were unrelated to access or scheduling , " and of those 17 patients , 14 died			1

an additional 17 cases identified in the report were not related to access issues			0
a follow - up report specifically focusing on the hospital system 's urology department is underway			1
' disappointment , frustration and loss of faith ' " this report can not capture the personal disappointment , frustration and loss of faith individual veterans and their family members had in the health care system that often could not respond to their mental and physical health needs in a timely manner , " said @entity21			2
" immediate and substantive changes are needed			1
" " i said at the time of my confirmation hearing that i will put veterans at the center of everything we do at @entity5 , " said @entity47			2
" so let me begin by offering my personal apologies to all veterans who experienced unacceptable delays in receiving care			1
it 's clear that we failed in that respect			2
" @entity21 estimated that only one - fourth of 93 facilities were not engaging in scheduling manipulation			1
" the bad news is that on the other three - fourths , we 're pretty confident that it was knowingly and willingly happening , " @entity21 said			2
" and we 're pursuing those			0
" the effects of the widespread wait list manipulation is still being felt			0

sen. @entity170 , @entity171 , implored @entity21 about the report 's findings and whether the @entity5 had edited it			0
his questioning hinged on a line in the report that indicated that the delays in care could not be conclusively linked to the deaths			0
@entity170 asked whether that line was included in the draft of the report submitted for review to the @entity5			0
" it was reported that a line was inserted , " @entity170 said			0
" and if you 're the @entity5 , this is the line you want inserted in that report			0
" " there are many versions of a draft report , " @entity21 replied			0
" the majority of the changes in our draft report came about as result of further deliberations by the senior staff of the inspector general 's office			1
no one in @entity5 dictated that sentence go in that report			0
" scathing report slams veterans ' care but says no definite link to deaths @entity21 explained that he hoped to have the results of the 93 additional site reviews completed by the end of the year			1
