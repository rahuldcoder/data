-- @entity2 rider @entity1 won the fifth stage of this year 's @entity4 after a mass sprint saw him narrowly beat @entity7 's @entity6 and @entity9 's @entity8			1
@entity1 , 26 , a sprint specialist who has now won 16 stages of the @entity4 since 2008 , edged what had been an eventful , crash - filled race			1
both @entity13 and defending champion @entity14 fell during the 164.5 kilometer stretch from @entity16 to @entity17 , the former being taken to hospital with head injuries			0
the @entity21 later retired from the race altogether			0
@entity24 @entity23 retained the leader 's yellow jersey after finishing tenth			2
" i think what the organizers have done this year is to make it harder to have a proper bunch sprint			0
that 's because we have been dominating in the last years , " @entity1 , widely regarded as the best sprint cyclist in the sport , told the @entity4 's official website shortly after the race			1
" the reason why we dominate the sprint at the @entity4 is , well , for me personally i have put every other race on the back foot to be good at the @entity4			2
" this year will be the 98th edition of the race , the most famous in cycling and one of the world 's best known sporting events			0
@entity1 , who was disqualified from an intermediate sprint in the third stage for illegally butting @entity23 -- who was also censured -- will find the next stage much harder : the sixth , 226.5 kilometer stage between @entity52 and @entity53 is @entity4 's longest			1
" that was a proper hard finish , " @entity1 admitted			2
" those last couple of hundred meters my legs were going ... i 'm really happy with that			0
