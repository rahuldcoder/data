@entity0 , @entity1 -- lazy , promiscuous , confused , selfish , brain damaged and overall hopeless are all labels that have been given to @entity1 's so - called post- 90s generation , or those who were born after 1990 who are now mostly in their teens today			1
whatever the post- 90s are , one thing for certain is they are different from those born before them : they have no memory of @entity1 's tumultuous past , instead only experiencing it as a country with rapid economic growth underscored by rampant consumerism and globalization			1
" they have only known a life in @entity1 that is rising and affluent , " @entity19 , a @entity0 - based internet analyst , said			1
" they are considered a wild card generation			2
they are very aggressive and outward looking and are pretty confident because they never felt hardship			0
" and they are also the first generation that has grown up with the internet			1
and it is there , online , where they live lives that are a marked departure from age - old cultural norms that remain ingrained in @entity1 society today			1
" when they turn away from the internet and look at the real world and they see that nothing has changed , there is this huge disconnect in their minds , " said @entity38 , chief operating officer for @entity39 , a @entity0 - based research firm			1
" their minds are in this internet way of thinking , and when their real world is not even moving , not even budging , they feel powerless			2
and so where do they escape ? they go back to the internet			2
" the @entity56 is one of the few , if only places , where those who are not post- 90s can see their sometimes radical behavior , try to communicate with them and attempt to figure out who , exactly , they are and what , exactly , they are thinking			1
" on the internet , they have the chance to be individuals , " said @entity66 , also with @entity39			2
" it is a totally new space for the youth to feel independent			2
they can criticize anyone , and no one will tell them they are wrong , and they can express themselves online without many restrictions			0
" the ways in which @entity1 's teens express themselves online vary			1
they hang out on @entity1 social networks , like @entity85 and @entity86 , post comments on microblogs as well as use @entity90 's highly popular instant messaging service qq and @entity92 , its social networking site and other online bulletin boards			1
on these platforms , they form what some have described as " tribes " or " clans " that can consist of thousands of members communicating via " @entity103 " language			0
" the ' @entity103 ' dialect most closely identified with the post- 90s alternative subculture is ' brain - damaged writing ' , which is essentially standard @entity112 written using the most obscure characters possible , " writes @entity104 , a @entity106 - based internet analyst on the blog @entity107			1
the post- 90s virtual world is also characterized by the photos and videos they share online			1
young women often post cartoon - like pictures of themselves with pursed lips , @entity119 - enlarged eyes ( to appear more like an animated characters ) while wearing chunky glasses , sexy , doll - like clothing or goth and punk styles borrowed from @entity128 and @entity129			2
" they want to show off : ' i am beautiful			0
i am a star , ' " @entity66 said			0
a post on the blog @entity134 titled " @entity138 's @entity137 " shows some of the more shocking sexual content the teen post online : " the general impression is @entity140 kids are ' out of control , ' behaving badly ' ... ' have mental problems ' and are ' engaging in sexual activities way too early , ' " the post says			2
not everyone views their behavior so negatively			0
" in the virtual world , they learn how to be leaders , to solve interpersonal conflicts , " said @entity148 , co-author of " an @entity149			0
" " these online activities make them more mature , give them more options and enlarge their visions			0
former generations did n't enjoy such colorful worlds			0
their understanding of the outside is limited and monotonous			0
" " society views us as wanting to be different , wanting to be full of personality and full of individuality and wanting to be creative in not a good way , " said @entity162 , an 18 - year - old student at @entity163 in @entity106			2
" we see the society as our enemy a little bit			0
we do not want to be so conventional because we think all of these things are old and especially in @entity1 we need some big changes			1
maybe we want to take this responsibility even though we might not have a really clear goal or aim for the future , " she said			0
the impact the post- 90s will have in @entity1 in the future as they mature into adults and become employees is the question many are now asking			1
some have already begun to trickle into the workforce , specifically in factories , a number of which have experienced strikes in recent months by young , rural workers unwilling to accept the low wages and poor working conditions of the past			1
according to @entity19 , the strikes can at least partially be attributed to the " jelly generation " ( another term used to describe the post- 90s ) and their laissez faire , independent and entrepreneurial attitude towards life			1
" they are more picky about where they work , " @entity19 said			0
@entity203 , author of " @entity204 : how the @entity209 is @entity208 " believes the post- 90s generation are much more entrepreneurial than their elders			1
" yes , they will effect change , and yes , they have a completely different culture than their parents , " said @entity203			0
" what happens online does materialize			0
it does drive behavior change in the real world			0

tech - savvy youth of @entity1 have become an *increasingly* studied *demographic*
called post- 90s generation with no memory of @entity1 's tumultuous recent past
they are avid social media and internet users
some social commentators have criticized post- 90s generation as lazy and immoral
