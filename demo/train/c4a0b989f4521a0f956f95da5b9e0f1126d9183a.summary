-- a new smartphone operating system is joining the fray			1
@entity3 released a phone running its new @entity5 in @entity6 on monday , joining leading mobile operating systems @entity8 and @entity9 , as well as smaller players @entity10 and @entity12			1
the @entity13 and @entity14 are very basic phones with 3.5 - inch screens , entry - level specs and appealingly low price tags			2
@entity19 will sell the @entity13 in @entity6 starting july 2 for 69 euros , or about $ 90			0
nonprofit company @entity3 is trying to shake up the typical closed app ecosystems with the @entity22 using open web standards , it will appeal to the estimated 8 million web developers who can jump right in and start creating html 5 apps for the phones			1
there is no timeline for when the phone will come to the @entity31			1
for now , @entity3 is focusing on emerging markets such as @entity6 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and eventually @entity36 , where an @entity37 is prohibitively expensive for most people			2
" for many of the users , this will be the first smartphone they would purchase , " said @entity39 , who heads the product team for @entity22 @entity5 is rolling out in locations where significant portions of the population are still using feature phones			1
multiyear service contracts that can cut the cost of a smartphone are n't as common , and expensive high - end handsets such as the @entity37 or @entity53 s - series are out of reach			0
cheap @entity8 devices are available , but at an event in @entity58 announcing the release , @entity3 cto @entity56 pointed out that most of those are running @entity61 , an old version of the @entity62 also said the company was realistic about its goals			2
" we are not aiming high and crashing into fortress @entity66 and fortress @entity68 , " said @entity56			0
design-wise , the @entity5 keeps it incredibly simple and intuitive to appeal to new smartphone users			2
the current home screen is most similar to the @entity37 , with a four - by - four grid of icons and a dock for the most - used apps along the bottom of the screen			2
@entity39 says this version is just a starting point			0
the company hopes developers will create custom interfaces for the devices that mimic what people love about @entity8 or @entity10 or even entirely new takes on the usual smartphone screens			0
@entity5 already has a few of the most popular apps , including @entity90 and @entity91 , as well as a maps app powered by @entity93			1
the usual built - in phone features are included for making phone calls , texting and browsing the @entity96			0
new html 5 apps will be available in the @entity98 after they 're screened for security , though @entity3 wo n't be kicking apps out for content			1
the first @entity5 phones are practical , not flashy , but the company hopes the combination of low price and open ecosystem will make it a moderate hit			1
" consumers do n't really know or care too much about what 's under the hood , " said @entity56			0
" they want something that has a brand they trust ... a good price and something that satisfies them about the apps			0
that 's a pretty short checklist			0

@entity3 's new @entity5 mobile operating system rolls out in @entity121
the phones are built on open web standards and run @entity126 apps
there are no immediate plans to bring the phones to the @entity31
