@entity0 -- @entity2 already had the highest cigarette taxes in the nation , and a new state law that went in to effect thursday pushed the price of smoking even higher			1
the state legislature on monday approved a bill adding an additional state tax of $ 1.60 to every pack			1
the bill , which was signed into law by gov. @entity13 , raised the state tax to a total of $ 4.35 per pack			1
@entity2 smokers pay an additional municipal tax of $ 1.50 per pack , so the new tax increase means that smokers in the city will pay $ 5.85 per pack in taxes			1
that drives the average local retail price up to nearly $ 11 per pack , according to some estimates			1
and it makes for the highest state - local tax whammy on tobacco in the country , according to the @entity31			1
@entity32 is the runner - up at $ 3.66 per pack in taxes , according to the organization			2
" i am about to quit because it 's getting ridiculous -- who can afford this ? " @entity41 resident @entity40 , 24 , said in response to thursday 's new per - pack price tag			2
and that 's just the kind of response anti-tobacco groups are hoping for			0
but for some @entity2 , the elevated prices are not as important			2
when asked whether he would continue to buy cigarettes @entity49 , 40 , said , " probably			0
we 're all puppets here			0
" he said he has been smoking for 20 years			0
@entity54 , 28 , reacted to the new price tag by saying , " i should quit now ... i get that cigarettes are bad			0
i do n't understand why they are so expensive here , we 're in the most expensive city			0
" the tax hike is aimed at generating an additional $ 440 million in 2010 - 2011 tax revenue to support health care programs			1
@entity63 , a spokesman for @entity64 , parent company for tobacco company @entity65 , said he was " extremely disappointed " with the increase that makes @entity0 's cigarette tax " far and away the highest in the nation			2
" " this huge tax increase will make the present contraband cigarette crisis in @entity0 much worse , " he said in a recent e-mail to @entity71			0
" and it will likely not raise the revenue projected , as it will provide even greater incentives for consumers to purchase contraband cigarettes to avoid paying these extremely high taxes and will cause further loss of business to @entity0 retailers selling state - taxed cigarettes			1
