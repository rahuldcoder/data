-- so much for destiny			0
the @entity2 seemingly had karma on their side and were ready to put a @entity6 ending on a memorable season , but the baseball gods had a different plan			1
for they had created a pitcher who had a performance that surely is n't that of a mortal			0
led by @entity14 , the @entity13 won an exciting and intriguing @entity16 game 7 by a 3 - 2 score			1
in the second @entity16 matchup of wildcard teams , it was n't to be for the young @entity2 , who even got the tying run to third base in the ninth inning			1
but the @entity13 had @entity14 , and no one was going to score against him			1
@entity26 early on , the @entity2 had to think things were going perfectly			1
they knocked out @entity13 starter @entity28 in a hurry , and it looked like @entity32 skipper @entity31 was going to have to make repeated calls to his bullpen			1
they were keeping the game close , even though they trailed by a run			2
sure , the @entity13 had @entity14 , their ace , available , but he just threw a complete game three days ago			1
even if he came in , it seemed impossible he 'd throw more than a couple innings			2
he threw an inconceivable five			0
you know the last time that 's been done before wednesday			0
" i was n't thinking about finishing the game or how many innings i was going to go or pitch count , " @entity14 said			1
" i was just wanting to get outs			0
" @entity14 finished the @entity16 with two wins , one incredible save and an era of 0.43			1
asked if he was fatigued after such a magnificent performance , the 25 - year - old star admitted , yeah , he was			0
" i ca n't lie to you any more ; i 'm a little tired now , " he said with a chuckle			0
90 feet from extra innings with @entity14 locked in and two out in the ninth , @entity32 fans could n't be blamed if they were celebrating			1
but @entity2 still had a little life			1
after all , these are the @entity2 who appeared doomed in the @entity61 wild card game , only to rally for a win			1
@entity64 's @entity63 was the last hope , and he laced a liner to left center			0
hearts in @entity64 sank as it appeared @entity69 might catch it			0
their hearts raced as the ball fell and skipped by the outfielder and rolled to the wall			0
@entity63 headed toward third as @entity76 fumbled the ball			0
could it be ? would @entity63 turn for home and score the most improbable of runs ? @entity32 manager @entity31 said he was just thinking : " let 's get the ball in because @entity63 can run			1
" @entity76 was able to pick up the ball and get it back to the infield in time to keep @entity63 from scoring			0
then @entity14 closed out the game , enticing @entity86 to pop out			1
" to end up losing the ball game by 90 feet , it 's tough , " @entity2 manager @entity87 said			1
" the hard part about this is , you work all year ( beginning in february ) to climb to the top of the mountain and then -- boom -- you fall back , and you got ta start right back at the bottom next year			0
" just wait til next year @entity2 fans have waited three decades ( it seems even longer ) but despite a tough loss , they were still proud of their lads			1
" the @ @entity2 may have lost , but this team and that city is all winner			1
thanks for a great post season			0
congrats @entity13 and @entity109 @ @entity107 ! ! ! ! " " @entity106 " actor @entity105 tweeted			0
" never been prouder of @ @entity2 on a great season and an absolutely unforgettable , drama - filled playoff run			2
well done , fellas , " @entity113 press secretary @entity112 wrote			0
" i love my @ @entity2 ! ! ! thanks for the best series i 've seen in 29 yrs ! congrats @entity13 , " added comedian @entity117			2
fans at @entity120 stayed after the end and even broke into a loud " @entity123 " chant			2
@entity124 bridges the gap years from now , when @entity124 shows off his @entity16 rings , people will ask him about watching @entity14 pitch			1
they 'll have long forgotten , if they ever knew , that @entity124 had a lower era in the 2014 postseason then even the @entity13 star			2
no one scored on @entity124			2
in game 7 , before @entity14 stole the headlines , @entity124 blanked the @entity2 for 2 1/3 innings			1
it earned him the win ( originally the win was given to @entity14 but the decision was changed later )			2
@entity124 has now pitched in 22 consecutive playoff games without surrendering a run			2
only the legendary @entity141 has done better			0
" @entity124 , he is incredible , " @entity31 said			2
" he 's played a critical role in these three championships			0
" party time @entity32 fans are used to watching their team win the @entity16 on the road			1
each of their clinching wins has been a road game			0
according to @entity0 affiliate @entity152 , fans took to the streets in the @entity154 and near @entity155 , where there had been a public watch party			1
and one person was shot in the arm , police told the station			2
the suspect was n't caught , police spokesman @entity162 told @entity152			0
only a few people had been arrested , he added			0
mayor @entity166 took to @entity167 to announce the victory parade would be held friday .			0

no one could have predicted @entity14 would have enough to pitch five innings
@entity124 was just as good , tossing more *scoreless* innings
@entity2 fans stay after game to show their pride
one person shot in @entity32 , @entity0 affiliate *reports*
