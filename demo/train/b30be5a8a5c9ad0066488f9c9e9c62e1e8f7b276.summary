-- call it confidence , or call it arrogance -- but whatever it is , @entity5 certainly has it			1
already 53 points clear in his bid for a fourth consecutive world @entity12 title , and seeking his third successive race victory , the @entity9 driver did not even bother trying to set a second lap in final qualifying for sunday 's @entity18			1
so assured was the @entity19 that he was quickest on saturday at @entity20 , a grueling street circuit where he has triumphed under lights the past two years , he sat in the team garage and watched his rivals try in vain to beat his leading lap time			1
" it was weird standing in the garage with roughly two minutes to go , " the 26 - year - old told reporters			0
" it then became much worse with the others making their final attempt and there 's nothing you can do			2
" interactive : see how @entity12 lights up @entity37 however , @entity39 ' @entity38 fell just short of @entity5 's one minute 42.841 seconds , with the @entity19 clocking 1:42.932			1
@entity42 ' @entity41 was third fastest in 1:43.058 , and the @entity43 will be joined on the second row of the grid by @entity5 's teammate @entity46 ( 1:43.152 )			1
@entity46 was fastest in the first sector , @entity38 quickest in the second and @entity41 in the third , but @entity5 's burst in the final section gave him the 41st pole position of his career " i watched the sector times closely with @entity41 , @entity38 and @entity46 , but fortunately my last sector was strong enough to stay ahead of @entity38 , " said @entity5 , who was fastest in friday 's second practice and edged @entity41 in saturday 's final warmup			1
" in the end it was a great feeling because it could have gone wrong			0
yesterday the gap to the others was a surprise , but today was more what we expected			0
" @entity38 is seeking his first podium placing since winning the @entity65 @entity18 five races ago in late june			1
" @entity68 has been really quick all weekend , " the 28 - year - old said			0
" it was very close in the end			0
one tenth ( of a second ) more would have been possible , but second is still a good result			0
" we 've good race pace and i 'm very confident for tomorrow			0
" his teammate @entity77 , who won the race in 2009 for @entity80 , was fifth fastest ahead of @entity81 -- who again out - qualified his @entity84 teammate @entity83			1
@entity83 , the @entity37 victor in 2008 and 2010 , was seventh -- while @entity85 , who will join the @entity86 at the @entity87 next year , will start in 13th after failing to reach @entity88 for @entity42 as he struggled with a back problem			1
@entity83 , who is second overall , and fellow title hopefuls @entity77 and @entity85 will need significant improvements on sunday if they are to stop @entity5 extending his lead in the drivers ' championship			1
it had been reported that @entity80 wanted @entity83 to return to the team where he had one unhappy season in 2007 , but he said after qualifyingn that he hoped to end his career at @entity84			2
" i 've spent the last four races saying i want to stay at @entity84 and maybe extend the contract when they would like , " the 32 - year - old said			0
" we are working very closely on arriving at that situation			0
to sit together and to try to do it , that 's my desire , and the team has expressed to me more or less the same desire when we talk about this			2
" @entity85 said he would start on sunday , despite problems with a trapped nerve			2
" this morning was very bad , " the @entity112 said			0
" i could n't really try , so we probably did n't get done what we wanted with the car , but at least we got it on the grid and we 'll see what we can do in the race			2
" it was good we drove in qualifying in the end , but it was not that nice			2
" @entity80 's @entity122 qualified eighth ahead of @entity125 's @entity124 , who will replace fellow @entity127 @entity46 at @entity9 next year			1
@entity129 's @entity128 completed the top 10 , with the @entity132 beating teammate @entity131 for the first time this year			0
he will start the race with a choice of tire compounds after declining to set a time in @entity88 .			0
