@entity13 , @entity14 tourists wanting to channel their inner @entity16 should head to @entity13			1
most of the @entity14 town 's 3,000 residents live underground , where they frequent a subterranean church , restaurant , hotel and shops			1

now a two - mile - long section of @entity42 -- accounting for only 2 % of the entire length of the mine 's passages -- is open to the public			1
things to see include statues , a chapel and a cathedral carved out by miners , all under light cast by chandeliers made from rock salt			2

it 's known early @entity107 hid in the man - made caves while they were still being persecuted for their religion			1
@entity112 , extending to a depth of 60 meters , is the largest cave -- it once housed 20,000 people , as well as their livestock			2
almost half of @entity112 is open to tourists			0
it 's connected to another subterranean settlement you can explore , @entity122 , via an eight - kilometer tunnel			1

the densely inhabited close was infested badly and a quarantine imposed on the 500 or so people who lived there in a bid to contain the disease			0
many of the inhabitants were simply left to die -- hence the stories of hauntings			0
the close was eventually opened up again and inhabited until 1753 , when the residents were finally evicted to make way for new buildings built above the old street			0
@entity130 was sealed up for 250 years before being reopened for tours as a vivid snapshot of 18th - century life			0

built on mudflats , the original settlement had been prone to flooding			0
several oceans of concrete later , the new city rose between three and 10 meters above the old			2
you can still visit the original @entity156 , though , on a guided tour			1

used prior to the 1800s to move goods from the ships that docked here , the tunnels got their name from the belief , probably false , that they were associated with " shanghaiing " -- the practice of kidnapping men to serve as sailors			0

this 120 - kilometer - long complex , part of a much larger network throughout the country , now operates as a war memorial and visitors -- or at least those who can squeeze through the tiny trapdoors -- can explore several of the tunnels			0
