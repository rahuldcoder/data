-- if you missed sunday night 's 65th @entity2 , do n't worry -- we can bring you up to speed			1
here are five things that will help you contribute to the morning buzz about television 's biggest night : 1 ) get ready to hear a lot about @entity9			1
you 're forgiven if you said , " who ? " when the " @entity12 " actress was announced as the @entity14 winner for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy			1
unless you 're a fan of the show , you may not have been aware of @entity9 or her smart turn as nurse @entity19 on the @entity21 series			1
but thanks to what host @entity22 called the " best speech ever , " plenty of people are now talking about @entity9			1
after receiving the first award of the evening , @entity9 took to the stage and hastily said , " thank you so very much			1
um , i got ta go , bye			0
" take note future winners of any awards show : sometimes less is more			2
2013 @entity14 : and the award for best acceptance speech goes to ... 2 ) @entity22 , we wanted to love you more			0
it was his second go - round as @entity14 host , and yet it just did n't feel like the @entity22 we were expecting			0
from the lackluster opening -- which featured the actor " binge watching " some of the past year 's television shows -- to his song - and - dance numbers , it felt less than overwhelming			2
" he did n't tarnish the winners ' evening , but he did nothing to burnish it , either , " @entity45 said of @entity22			0
@entity49 and @entity50 heckled him from the audience during the opening monologue , making us yet again sound the alarm for that pair to host every awards show , always			2
past @entity14 hosts show up to help @entity22 3 ) @entity58 loves innuendo			1
the actor scored a best actor in a movie or miniseries @entity14 for his role as @entity64 in the @entity66 movie " @entity67 , " and he used the moment as an opportunity to tease co-star @entity70 , who played @entity64 's lover			1
calling his @entity14 statue a " two - hander , " @entity58 quipped , " and @entity70 , you 're only as good as your other hand			1
... you were magnificent , and the only reason i 'm standing here is because of you			0
so you really deserve half of this			0
do you want the bottom or the top ? " @entity85 laughing			0
4 ) the show was kind of sad -- and it made some mad			2
yes , we lost some stars this year , and the decision to pay homage to some of them -- including @entity93 and @entity94 -- seemed like a lovely idea			0
but the personal tributes from their friends and co-stars definitely brought the energy way down for some viewers and also led to the issue of some stars being left out			0
" i really felt like @entity104 should have been honored in that group of five actors that passed this year that were honored in a very heartfelt and moving way , " @entity104 's " @entity105 " co-star @entity103 told @entity0			2
" i thought he deserved to be singled out as well			0
" 5 ) @entity110 and his kids are way funnier than most of @entity112			1
@entity110 presented the last two awards of the evening -- best comedy and best drama -- with an assist from his three sons : @entity118 , 9 , @entity119 , 6 , and @entity120 , 3			1
dressed more like they were headed to a sporting match than the @entity14 stage , the four had the audience rolling			0
" unfortunately @entity125 and @entity126 dropped out at the last second , and they called me literally 45 minutes ago and i could n't find child care , ok , " @entity110 explained			1
" we had a soccer game ; there was a neighbor 's birthday party , a nut allergy , i did n't have time to do my hair			2
it does n't matter , it 's great to be here			0
" @entity0 's @entity141 contributed to this report .			0

" @entity12 's " @entity9 keeps it brief but to the point
" @entity67 " winner @entity58 teases @entity70
will @entity110 and his three sons steal the show as presenters
