editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			2

@entity2 says it 's hypocritical to oppose school vouchers while sending your children to private school			1
( @entity16 ) -- when president @entity18 signs the $ 410 billion omnibus spending bill , there will be shouts of joy from both sides as @entity23 and @entity24 get their cherished earmarks			1
yet tucked into that bill is an amendment pushed by the president 's former colleague in the @entity30 , @entity31 democrat @entity28 , who used his influence to essentially kill the @entity34 school vouchers program			1
oh sure , it will be portrayed that the @entity24 are n't killing the program , but the initiative calls for no new students to be allowed entry , unless approved by @entity40 and the @entity41			2
and considering that the teachers union has such a death grip on both @entity24 - controlled institutions , you can forget about that happening			0
@entity24 say they believe in school choice , but they do n't fully accept the gamut of choices			2
they will happily tout charter schools , also opposed by the national teachers unions , but stop at vouchers			0
why ? because @entity23 have consistently advocated for vouchers , and @entity24 have convinced themselves that vouchers will somehow destroy the public school infrastructure			1
now , some believe the @entity18 administration is sending mixed signals because education secretary @entity58 has said he does n't want to see kids thrown out of @entity34 schools who are already in the existing voucher program			1
but the reality is that after this year , no new kids will be allowed to enroll in the program , and that folks , is killing the program			0
@entity18 and his party have never been fans of vouchers			2
why ? they contend that vouchers would hurt the public school system			2
vouchers allow parents who ca n't afford private school to remove their children from public schools in order to get a better education			1
well , is n't that what the president and those in his party do themselves by sending their children to private school ? only they do n't need the government 's help			1
the standard fallback position of @entity24 and the @entity18 administration is that the @entity34 program only helps 1,700 children a year , and those who do n't qualify are stuck in a sorry system , and they are largely poor and minority			1
they contend that since every student ca n't be helped by vouchers , none should be helped			0
so parents and children are supposed to sit tight and wait on the promised reform to trickle down from @entity34 to the local school systems , and then all will be well ? to me , that 's sort of like saying that historically african - americans are likely to have high rates of diabetes and hypertension , so instead of launching a program to save some from developing the disease , let 's wait for a comprehensive plan where all can be saved at one time			1
i believe you save as many as you can now , and continue to save the rest later			0
this should n't be an either / or proposition , but an and / both situation			0
the other fundamental problem here is that we have a bunch of politicians deciding what 's best for education over the objections of actual educators ! for instance , @entity24 have had high praise for the superintendent of schools in @entity34 , @entity136			1
just one problem : she supports vouchers			0
" i do n't think vouchers are going to solve all the ills of public education , but parents who are zoned to schools that are failing kids should have options to do better by their kids , " she told @entity140			2
so if @entity136 backs them , why not give her the vote of confidence to continue the program while she tries to fix the ailing school system ? the education reform outlined by president @entity18 on tuesday is necessary			1
but we are a long way from seeing the kind of systemic changes that will fix our public schools			2
his plan goes far on personal and parental responsibility , yet relies on states to enact their own measures of change , and with 50 different state school plans , we know that is a disaster waiting to happen			0
i would have more confidence if president @entity18 and members of @entity40 truly walked the walk and sent their kids to public schools			1
if they have so much faith in them turning around with reform , entrust their own children to public education			0
that 's the kind of confidence our system needs			0
if it 's good enough for yours , then surely it 's good enough for mine			0
but preaching to the rest of us about the virtues of a public education , then sending your own children to private school and denying the use of vouchers so others can do the same , is frankly hypocritical			1
i know the value of a public education , and went to such institutions for elementary , middle , high school and college			0
yet looking at the sorry state public schools are in now , maybe seeing kids leave in droves via vouchers will force school administrators and teachers to stop thinking they have all the answers and allow for innovation and full accountability , from the classroom to the boardroom			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : omnibus spending bill essentially kills @entity34 school vouchers
he says @entity24 oppose the bill because they think it *weakens* public schools
@entity2 : vouchers let parents do what @entity18 does -- send kids to private school
he says president is being hypocritical by not letting the program continue
