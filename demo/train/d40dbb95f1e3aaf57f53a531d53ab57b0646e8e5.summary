-- if it were a heavyweight boxing contest it would probably be ruled a mismatch			0
a cut - above @entity7 player against a @entity8 -- and just about everywhere else -- golfing legend			1
in the blue corner , a man with precisely zero major titles -- tied sixth his best finish			0
in the red , an eight - time major champion -- and so nearly nine , improbably aged almost 60 , at the @entity17			0
@entity19 captaincy experience ? next year is @entity4 's first match in charge , although he was twice on winning sides as a vice-captain			1
@entity5 led the 1993 @entity25 team which shocked @entity26 at its beloved @entity27 to wrest back the famous trophy			1
playing record in the biennial sporting showdown ? @entity4 two wins and two halves from nine matches			2
@entity5 , 10 wins and a half from 15 matches			2
but if the prospect of going head to head against a sporting icon in the ultimate in team sports competition has left him fazed , @entity4 is showing little sign of it			1
as the @entity47 captain , the genial 46 - year - old @entity45 will pit his wits against @entity5 , who not only has won five @entity50 titles , but is revered in @entity51 where the 2014 match will take place at the famous @entity55 course			1
with a year to go until the first shots are struck in anger in @entity58 , @entity4 is well aware that the @entity60 nature of the contest , at least as far as the team captains are concerned , is a talking point			1
" four of @entity5 's open championships came here in @entity51 , he 's got a real affinity with the people , so he 's going to bring that very strong dynamic to his team , " @entity4 told @entity0 's @entity65 program			1
" he won in 1993 , away from home as well , so i do n't underestimate him , neither do the players			0
" he 'll make some astute decisions , no doubt about that			0
but ultimately it 's not between myself and @entity5 , it 's about 12 players in each team and how well they play			1
" as much as the captains are important , it 's really about the 24 players			0
" leading golf journalist @entity87 , who has covered every @entity19 since 1977 , said while the captain 's role was clearly influential , it was sometimes overstated			2
" in many ways a captain can lose the @entity19 , but in the end it is very difficult for him to win it , " said @entity87 , who is the editor at large of @entity90			2
" @entity4 is hugely respected and represents all those players who have made a very good living but are not superstars			2
" i think it 's healthy that you can become a @entity19 captain without winning majors			0
" where @entity4 may also have an advantage is that he remains a full - time member of the @entity7 and gets to see his likely team and picks close up on the golf course			1
the 64 - year - old @entity5 , by contrast , plays on the @entity25 seniors ' @entity110 , occasional appearances in the majors excepted			1
veteran campaigner " i think i 'm the second oldest guy with a card on @entity8 , but i still enjoy playing , " @entity4 said			2
" i played well last season with a couple of top - five finishes , so when i play well , i 'm still able to compete			0
" it has also enabled him to sample at first hand the layout at @entity55 , where battle will be joined from september 26 - 28 next year			2
@entity4 played all four rounds of the recent @entity122 , the last tournament to be played on the @entity58 course before the 40th @entity19 contest			2
" i 'll be watching the positions in the fairway and wondering if there 's anything i can change or if there 's anything we need to change to maximize and give our team an advantage next year , " he told @entity0 before the event			2
" we 've got the experience of playing 10 years around here , the @entity122 , a lot of us know the pin positions and how the course is normally set up , we can use that to our advantage			0
" but like his predecessors as @entity47 captain before him , @entity142 and @entity143 , @entity4 admits that his own playing performances have suffered			1
career sacrifice " it 's tough			0
there 's no doubt there 's a lot of challenges , all the previous captains have taught me how difficult it is to focus on your own career , " he said			0
@entity4 's peak came between 2002 and 2006 , when he played on three successive winning @entity47 teams			1
although his overall personal record is mediocre , it was his 10 - foot putt on the 18th to secure a half against @entity165 at @entity27 in 2002 which secured the cup for @entity26			1
a respected elder statesman , he was a natural to assist both @entity142 and @entity143 as a vice-captain in their victorious campaigns			0
it also put him firmly in the frame to step up when the choices were being made for the 2014 match			0
with @entity142 and former major winners such as @entity181 and @entity182 also being touted for the prestigious job , @entity4 's failure to reach the very top of the game as a player was thought to count against him			2
@entity19 standout @entity184 , although an admirer of @entity4 , went public with his support for @entity182			2
" @entity4 has played three @entity188 , @entity182 has played five , won a major championship and a lot of other tournaments worldwide			0
you have to have criteria somewhere and he edges it for me , " the @entity192 was quoted as saying			0
unanimous choice @entity4 admits that by the time the process reached a conclusion with a vote of the @entity200 in @entity201 in january , he was resigned to his fate			0
" if the captaincy had n't come my way it would n't be the end of the world for me , and to be honest in the last week or so before the vote i had been fatalistic about it , " he revealed			0
@entity4 was eventually the unanimous choice of the committee and has set about forging his own imprint on the team ; winning an extra captain 's pick -- two became three -- was the first task accomplished			1
" it 's going so fast			0
i ca n't believe it 's been six months since i was appointed , but fortunately it 's going very well so far , " he said			0
the acid test will come in the autumn of next year when @entity4 makes those crucial three picks then attempts to lead his team to their eighth win in the last 10 stagings			1
the last two matches at @entity227 and @entity228 , where @entity26 recovered from a four - point overnight deficit to score a spectacular triumph , have been desperately tight and @entity4 believes they act as motivation for the @entity25 team			1
" they are obviously keen to sort this out			0
@entity5 is here to do business and he is taken this on ... again ... at his age ... for a reason : to win it			1
" @entity87 is already predicting another tense affair and believes it adds to the magic of the @entity19			0
close contest " it 's better if there is only a half - point or point in it and it would n't be the worst thing in the world if @entity25 were to win it , to help retain the interest of their public in the event			1
" he believes that the visitors could not have chosen a better captain than the legendary @entity5			1
" he even has a legend 's voice , with so much gravitas ! " he will boost the @entity25 team and is particularly adored in @entity51 , where he has had a love affair with the country after winning the @entity50 four times			1
" @entity4 is also popular wherever he plays and takes great heart from the " incredible " performance of @entity26 's women in the @entity268 against the @entity25 , beating the hosts by eight points in @entity271 last month			1
" i hope this will propel the @entity273 to a brighter commercial future , like the @entity19 did for us , " he said			0
certainly the exploits of the late @entity277 helped to send golf into wider markets , with other major winners such as @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity181 and @entity143 giving the @entity47 team the basis for continued success			1
@entity55 countdown but @entity4 believes there is greater strength in depth now			0
" back then we had six or seven really strong players , maybe four or five not so strong , and there would be a heavy dependence on the star men			0
" it 's different now , illustrated last year ( at @entity228 ) when @entity143 played all 12 players on the first day			1
" @entity298 employs the same inclusive approach at @entity55 , only time will tell , but he gained the reputation of being an astute tactician when he led the @entity303 and @entity305 team to wins over @entity26 in the @entity307 in 2009 and 2011			2
" he 's a detail man and that should make him a very good @entity19 captain , " said @entity87			0
@entity5 will surely inspire the @entity25 to great heights next year , so it remains to be seen if @entity4 can match him in a fascinating subplot to the eventual outcome .			1
