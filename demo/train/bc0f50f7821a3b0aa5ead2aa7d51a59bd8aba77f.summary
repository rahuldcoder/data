@entity0 -- it was 2 a.m. on sunday april 18 , 1989 when the phone rang , jolting me out of bed			1
i recognized the distinctive voice of the caller @entity7 , a student at @entity8 , also known in @entity9 as @entity8			1
" our group is marching out of @entity8 now , " he said excitedly			0
" we are going to @entity13			0
if you want to see this rally , you better come now			0
" @entity7 was a student leader i had befriended weeks earlier while visiting @entity8 , my alma mater			2
for months , @entity8 had been the center of student ferment			2
i was then a correspondent for time in @entity9			1
of course , i was keen to cover what seemed like a reawakening of campus activism			0
i grabbed my satchel , bolted from our apartment and drove to @entity8 , some 12 miles from the city center			0
i was more excited than tense			0
it had been a long time since @entity9 had dared demonstrate on the streets			2
tension had been building in @entity0 , in the officialdom and among political activists , since @entity32 was unceremoniously dismissed as @entity34 chief			1
@entity32 was lined up to succeed his mentor @entity35 , but he was sacked for being too soft on " bourgeois liberalization " , a catchphrase for @entity39 political ideas and cultural influences			2
he was specifically blamed for failing to suppress waves of student demonstrations that buffeted several @entity9 cities from december 1986 to january 1987			1
upon @entity32 's dismissal , @entity9 premier @entity44 took over as acting general secretary			1
on april 15 , 1989 , @entity32 died after suffering a heart attack			0
his death came as a shock to many @entity9 , especially among @entity0 's intelligentsia who considered the defrocked leader as a champion of reform			1
students lionized @entity32 as a open - minded @entity34 leader			1
past midnight on april 18 , more than 4,000 students from @entity8 and @entity57 marched out of their campuses and set off on a 12 - mile bivouac to @entity13			0
holding hands and linking arms , the students chanted patriotic slogans and sung the national anthem and the @entity65 , the @entity34 's anthem			1
as their ranks swelled i abandoned my car and followed their march for four hours			0
hundreds of @entity0 residents joined the procession , on foot and on their bicycles			2
police arrived but did not try to stop them			0
it was a precedent - setting breach of the government ban on demonstrations			0
read more : 25 years on , @entity81 no less taboo for censors when the rallyists reached the mostly empty and unlighted @entity13 , a dozen protesters unfurled a 20 - foot long white sheet of cloth			1
splashed on it in big black characters : @entity9 's soul			1
by then it was daybreak			0
as the students dispersed peacefully , i walked back home , pondering what the march meant and how i could get @entity96 editors interested in doing a story			1
my editors did not need much prompting			0
for the next few days , students continued their public gatherings , making speeches , writing posters , staging sit - ins and marching in the streets			0
their numbers swelled as students from other colleges joined in			0
at each turn of events , the indecision and successive blunders of the @entity9 authorities served only to embolden the protesters , and widen what evolved into an epic student movement			2
week after week for over two months , the global media 's attention focused on @entity81 , as the students and their supporters denounced official corruption and clamored for reforms , freedom and democracy			1
from april through june , time ran five cover stories , four consecutively , on the @entity81 protests			2
little did i know that , when i was awakened by that early morning phone call , it would be just the beginning of what would later be known alternatively as the " @entity132 " and the " @entity81 " , a student movement that would snowball into a massive @entity135 protest -- and end so tragically on june 4 , 1989 .			1

@entity1 @entity0 *bureau* chief @entity137 was a @entity96 correspondent in @entity0 in 1989
25 years *ago* he received a 2 a.m. phone call *informing* him of a student march on @entity81
he followed the students on their march , inspired by the death of a sacked @entity34 chief
he had little notion that what would unfold would shake @entity9 and grip the world 's attention
