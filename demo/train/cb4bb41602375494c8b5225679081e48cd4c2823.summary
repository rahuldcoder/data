-- @entity1 and @entity2 already have photos and memories of 4 - year - old @entity5 , the @entity7 - positive @entity6 orphan they met in november and hoped to welcome into their family			1
now they do n't know what the future holds after @entity6 president @entity14 on friday signed a controversial law that bans the adoption of @entity6 children by @entity19 families			1
the new law creates uncertainty for 46 @entity19 families who have already met prospective adoptees , according to the @entity24			2
the agency , which helps facilitate foreign adoptions , hopes @entity6 will lift the ban altogether , but in the meantime is working to resolve pending adoptions			1
read more : @entity6 's @entity14 signs anti- @entity19 adoption bill as far as the @entity33 know , their dossier was submitted to a @entity6 court on friday , one month after meeting @entity5 in a children 's home outside @entity37			1
otherwise , they have no idea where their case stands or how the new law will affect them			1
" we just hope everything works out so we can bring her home , " @entity43 said in a phone interview from his home in @entity46 , @entity47			1
" we told her we were going to be back for her and she said she would wait for us , " he said			2
" now we 're in limbo			0
" the couple already has one adopted child , 4 - year - old @entity57 from @entity58 , and two biological children			1
but they wanted to continue growing their family , and their @entity64 faith led them to again consider adoption , @entity43 said			1
@entity2 's experience volunteering for an international nonprofit had also opened their eyes to the difficulties orphans with medical conditions face in finding a family , leading them to specifically request a child who was @entity7 - positive			1
" we knew that there was an overwhelming need for children to be adopted , especially children with special needs , " @entity43 said			1
" we had means and love to give , so we figured that would be the best way to serve the @entity84 and the world			0
" they completed about 90 hours of online and classroom training on cultural awareness and raising a special - needs child before arriving in @entity37 at the end of november			1
they met with an official from the region 's @entity93 , who gave them an information packet with @entity5 's picture , @entity43 said			1
they accepted the referral and drove about 70 miles ( 115 km ) east of @entity37 to the children 's home , an imposing facility surrounded by high fences topped with barbed wire			2
inside , they found a clean and safe environment for children ages 4 to 16			2
they first saw @entity5 from a distance in the audience of a talent show and later met her face - to - face accompanied by a nurse and doctor , @entity43 said			1
she seemed shy and unsure at first			0
but when the nurse explained that they were there to take her home , her face flushed and she smiled , he said			0
" she captured our hearts , " he said			0
" we went there guided by the @entity84 , and she was the one the @entity84 put in front of us			0
" @entity19 tend to seek adoptions abroad because of the perception that it 's easier and that there are more children in need in other countries than in the @entity19			2
in the past 20 years , @entity19 have adopted about 60,000 @entity6 children , according to the @entity24			1
in 2011 , @entity19 adopted 970 children from @entity6 , making it third to @entity133 ( 2,589 in 2011 ) and @entity58 ( 1,727 ) , according to the @entity24			1
still , most adoptions are domestic			0
@entity19 citizens adopted 17,416 children from foreign countries in 2008 , accounting for 13 percent of adoptions that year compared to approximately 136,000 children in the @entity19 , according to a 2011 report from the @entity19 @entity141			2
" generally , it 's perceived that orphans have far greater challenges abroad than they do in the @entity19 , so when it comes to adopting a child , families typically want to raise a child out of a desperate situation , " said @entity142 , founder of @entity143 , a faith - based support network for those connected to adoption and foster care			1
another common perception is that it costs less to adopt internationally			0
but estimates show that variables such as travel , visa and attorney fees can drive up the cost			0
international adoptions also offer families who do n't want open adoptions more distance from biological parents -- geographically , psychologically and logistically			0
when @entity170 found out she could n't have children , she and her husband started looking abroad to avoid potential conflicts with birth parents			2
she knows that stance might draw criticism , but at the time it was a very real fear			0
" i was scared of the birth mother having a role in our lives , or taking the child back or changing her mind , " she said			2
" when you 're standing on the edge of adoption , every angle of it is scary			0
until you 're in those shoes and faced with the decision you really ca n't judge			0
" the couple came across @entity6 as an option and ultimately found the experience to be so positive that they planned to return there to adopt a daughter			1
the process was relatively quick , from the moment they submitted paperwork in august 2008 to when they left the country on february 7 , 2009 , with the 20 - month - old boy they later renamed @entity203			0
he knows he is adopted and where he 's from , she said			0
she and her husband try to instill in him an awareness of @entity6 culture through maps , books and tv shows about @entity6			2
they have also become part of a community of @entity6 - @entity19 families in @entity216 in an effort to stay connected to his roots			1
it 's part of his story , and we do n't want to erase that , " she said			0
she remembers the day her son thanked her for " choosing " him			0
it broke her heart and reminded her of the other children still waiting for a family to choose them , which is why she was eager to return to @entity6 for @entity235 's sister			1
if the ban holds up , she and her husband will pursue a domestic adoption			0
she sympathizes with @entity6 who want their children to stay in the land where they born but thinks the children are the ones who will suffer			1
" our son had been in that baby home for 12 months when we came along , " she said			0
" you do n't understand the need until you see it			0
we walked into that baby home and saw the number of children that need homes			2
" follow @entity0 living on @entity254 and @entity255 on @entity256 @entity0 's @entity257 contributed to this report .			0
