-- when members of the @entity5 women 's hockey team received their silver medals this week , they looked as if millstones were being slung around their necks			1
improbably tied by the @entity9 in the final minute of the medal game , then destroyed by a sudden death goal in overtime , they were understandably upset			1
ditto for the men as @entity9 's puck handlers hounded them all over the ice , and left the @entity5 players gasping as their hopes for hockey gold skated away , defeated 1 - 0			1
through the long history of the @entity22 , no country has won more medals than the @entity5			1
so one might think , amid all that bounty , the @entity5 would take a loss or two in stride			2
but in many ways , as a culture , @entity5 often act as if second place -- or third -- is somehow like being tagged with a scarlet letter " l " for loser			2
i like winning as much as the next soul , but treating anything except ultimate victory as @entity38 or a cause for shame is a mistake			1
first , every competitor from every nation at the @entity22 has already joined extraordinarily elite company			1
there are about 2,850 athletes at the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48			2
compared with the world 's population of more than 7 billion , that makes each not a 1 - in - a - million personality , but roughly 1 - in - 2.5 - million			1
yes , some are certainly great athletes			2
and while the rest may come across as adequate amateurs , they are almost all rare , elite individuals with astonishing skills -- even when they finish near the bottom of the rankings			2
breaking through ? nearly impossible			2
true , 294 medals will be awarded before the @entity60 are done , but with so many nations competing , that means for each medal winner more than nine other athletes will go home with nothing but photos and memories			2
the second reason we should cheer louder and longer than we do for those who finish out of the medals ? because their efforts are often no less heroic , and no less demanding than those who triumph			1
they may finish in the back because they struggled with injury , against personal adversity , or amid the tiny genetic imperfections that can make the difference between a champion and a contender			2
in the @entity88 in @entity89 , my friend @entity5 marathoner @entity86 wanted to win			0
he had taken the silver medal in @entity91 in 2004 , becoming the first @entity5 in more than 30 years to make it to the marathon podium , and he was intent on repeating			0
through the winding streets , and over the torturous cobblestones , he ran to win so hard that he had to crawl around his hotel room the next day , unable to even stand on his battered feet			0
he was taken to his airplane in a wheelchair			0
he finished fourth , yet every runner who watched will attest that @entity86 's race was brave and brilliant			1
which brings us to the third reason for everyone to feel better about all who compete : this is where greatness comes from			0
as much as athletes appear to spring fully formed upon the planet during events like the @entity22 , almost without exception they have toiled in anonymity for years			1
while the rest of us have slept in , they have risen before dawn to face the darkness and cold , bending their muscles and bones to compete			0
while the rest of us have commuted home to complain about our jobs , they have rushed from work to train again far into the night			0
and for all that , even the best have lost over and over and over again			0
losing is what teaches you how to get better			1
losing shows you what you 're doing wrong			1
losing is where winning begins			1
maybe i have a natural affinity for the " also ran " crowd			0
i used to win races when i was a kid , but now even though i train thousands of miles , and run marathons and 50 mile ultra-races , age makes it unlikely i 'll ever win anything again			0
but in the middle of the pack i still feel the great struggle of all of those around me ; i see people wrestling with the conflicts of their lives , the pain of effort , the clock , and the relentless miles			0
this is the greatness of sport			0
and i see it in all the olympians			0
a medal around your neck is a spectacular thing , and those who win one ought to be lauded as the best			0
but we should all run to catch up to the " also rans " too , if only for a moment to pat them on the back			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			1

@entity171 offers three reasons we should cheer louder and longer than we do for losers
at the @entity22 level , says @entity171 , just making it there should be *admired*
foreman : losing teaches you how to get better ; it 's where winning begins
