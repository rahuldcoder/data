-- investigators probing the june crash of an @entity4 flight in the @entity5 still do not know what brought the plane down , who was at the controls when it crashed , or what the pilots did in the moments leading up to the disaster , according to a new report released thursday			1
" at this stage ... it is still not possible to understand the causes and circumstances of the accident , " investigators said in the report			1
flight 447 -- an @entity23 -- went down in stormy weather in the @entity5 june 1 while flying from @entity25 , @entity26 , to @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
all 228 people on board were killed			2
most of the bodies were never recovered			2
@entity29 's air accident investigation agency , the @entity34 , released its second interim report into the crash thursday			1
it had been planning a news conference at the same time , but canceled it because of snow in @entity28			2
the plane hit the water belly first , essentially intact , studies of the debris and the bodies that have been recovered show			0
oxygen masks were not deployed , indicating that the cabin did not depressurize , the report said			0
automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring airspeed , the investigators said			1
but that alone was not enough to cause the disaster , they added			0
" inconsistency in the measurements of airspeeds was one of the elements in a chain of events that led to the accident , though this alone can not explain it , " the report says			0
large parts of the plane -- including the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder -- have never been found , leaving investigators without key pieces of the puzzle			1
investigators are preparing to begin a new search for the recorders in february , the report said			1
but the area where the plane went down is far out in the @entity5 -- two to four days for ships from the nearest ports in @entity26 or @entity80 in west africa			1
the underwater terrain is rough , with great variations in depth -- that is , underwater mountains and valleys -- over short distances , the report says			0
the new search will involve air accident investigators from the @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity26 , @entity94 , the @entity95 and @entity29 , as well as the @entity96			1
the search is planned to last 60 days , the report said			2
@entity99 , director of the @entity29 investigation bureau , told reporters earlier this week that the new search , about 1,000 kilometers ( 600 miles ) from @entity26 's northeast coast , will involve sonar and robot submarines			2
@entity99 was in @entity25 to speak to the relatives of the 58 @entity26 who were on board , the @entity29 news agency @entity105 reported sunday			0
" we tried to convince the families that we are conducting the investigation with the full intention of getting to the truth , " he said			0
tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes , which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air , and are part of a system used to determine air speed			0
before it crashed , @entity125 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms , officials have said			1
the @entity128 issued a directive in late august requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by @entity132 on @entity133 and @entity134			0
it said airlines should replace them with other @entity132 tubes and those manufactured by @entity140 .			0

investigators still do *n't* know what caused an @entity4 *jet* to crash
the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have never been found
investigators are preparing to begin a new search for the recorders in february
