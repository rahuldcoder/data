-- on the outskirts of @entity7 , nestled along @entity8 and within sight of the iconic @entity2 statue , one of the world 's largest open - air landfills has closed after more than three decades of operation			1
the landfill , known as @entity12 or @entity13 , is piled almost 300 feet high across 14 million square feet -- the equivalent of 244 american football fields			1
it is the largest landfill in @entity18 and all of @entity19			1
built in the late 1970s , it received close to 8,000 tons of trash daily , 70 % of all the trash in the @entity7 metro area			1
the closure comes less than three weeks before the @entity27 ' @entity26 summit , where world representatives will gather to take a direct look at sustainable solutions for the @entity32 's environment			0
the move also comes in advance of @entity7 's preparations to host the @entity36 and the @entity37			1
it 's part of a continuing effort led by @entity7 's state environment minister to close all of the area 's five official open - air landfills -- as well as an unknown number of clandestine ones -- by 2014			1
@entity18 tries to balance farming and forests the landfills are giving way to more modern treatment facilities designed to reduce their environmental impact			0
in @entity12 's case , the daily trash will now go to @entity53 , which the government says is the most advanced treatment plant in @entity56			1
it 's designed to curb production of greenhouse gases and pollution of the @entity8 marshes			0
according to the city of @entity7 , the sludge from the decomposing trash will be treated and turned into recycled water , and escaping methane will be harvested			1
at @entity12 , about 75 million cubic meters of methane gas will be collected over the next 15 years			2
the @entity18 petroleum company @entity68 will purchase the gas and use it to run one of its refineries			0
after 15 years , the landfill will be turned into a park , officials say			2
at the turn of the century , complaints arose that @entity8 was not safe for bathing because of contaminants leaching from @entity12			1
the city announced the closing of the landfill several times but always postponed it until now			0
part of the proceeds from the methane sales will go toward rehabilitating the drug - infested slums , or favelas , that have sprung up around the landfill			1
@entity7 mayor @entity88 sees the closing of the landfill as an end to " the crime that @entity7 has committed for the last 40 years			1
" at its peak , @entity12 had about 5,000 catadores , people who spend their days scouring landfills for plastic , paper , wood , metal and anything else that can be sold to recycling companies			1
their numbers have dwindled to about 2,000 as business at the landfill has wound down , city officials said , and now there is concern about their future			0
these workers , whose ages range from 16 to 87 , have been depicted by many media outlets and were featured in @entity115 's @entity114 - nominated 2010 documentary " @entity116			2
" the film helped raise funds for the catadores , whose work supports close to 15,000 residents near the landfill , according to government estimates , and is responsible for much of the city 's recycling			1
according to @entity18 's environment ministry , only 18 % of the entire country 's recycling is done as part of a formal program			0
that means most recycling is done by catadores			2
the president of the @entity136 , @entity137 , notes that there are about 1 million catadores all across @entity18			0
" this is a promising market that needs to be a humanized form of work , " he said			0
catadores at @entity12 generally earn about the @entity18 minimum wage , roughly $ 268 @entity146 dollars a month			1
but in many cases , they can bring home twice as much			0
according to the city of @entity7 , the cooperative and city officials negotiated more than $ 11 million as severance to be split among those workers who could prove they had been working at the site for the last few years			1
the severance , paid by the company responsible for the harvesting of the methane gas , is being paid to more than 1,600 workers			0
how loggers are helping replant rain forests the cooperative was also able to negotiate with the state government to set up a fund that will , for the next 14 years , provide funding for projects to educate the workers and provide them with tools to continue the job of recycling			1
the fund will also pay for classes if workers want to pursue another trade or career			0
@entity178 often work in dangerous conditions and receive no benefits			0
they are frequent victims of diseases such as dengue fever , spread by mosquitoes that breed in the landfill 's stagnant water , as well as respiratory ailments and infections attributable to rats , birds and other vermin			0
in addition , medical waste from all the hospitals in the area was dumped at @entity12			2
the workers can seek treatment at state hospitals through @entity18 's precarious public health system			0
the closing of the landfills is bittersweet to these workers			2
the cooperative and its members know this is a step forward in rebuilding and conserving @entity7 's environment , but for many , this also means their only source of income has gone down the drain			2
@entity209 , 87 , is described in the cooperative 's blog as one of the oldest pickers working in the @entity12 landfill			2
she 's worked there for more than 30 years , has nine children and is illiterate			0
" i fear for my future , because i need to keep working , " she said in one post .			0

a @entity7 dump , the largest in @entity19 , is closing after three decades
