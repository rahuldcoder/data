" in a speech on internet freedom and security , @entity5 also urged @entity9 to investigate a wave of cyber attacks against @entity12 and other companies			1
the @entity15 and other technologies are critical to foreign policy , and those who engage in cyber attacks should face international condemnation , she said			1

@entity12 charges that @entity9 hackers have targeted @entity12 and up to 34 other companies			1

@entity9 , @entity68 and @entity69 have stepped up their censorship of the @entity15 , " she said			1

and last friday in @entity75 , 30 bloggers and activists were detained			0
" a member of that group , having since been freed , was in the audience , @entity5 said			0
" so while it is clear that the spread of these technologies is transforming our world , it is still unclear how that transformation will affect the human rights and welfare of much of the world 's population , " she said			2
" the same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable @entity96 to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent , " @entity5 said			0

citizens and businesses must be able to rely on the security of information networks , @entity5 said			0
" our ability to bank online , use electronic commerce and safeguard billions of dollars in intellectual property are all at stake if we can not rely on the security of information networks , " she said			0
referring to social and economic development , @entity5 said the @entity15 can serve as a " great equalizer			2
" by providing people with access to knowledge and potential markets , networks can create opportunity where none exist			0
" over the last year , i 've seen this first hand in @entity136 , where farmers have seen their income grow by as much as 30 percent since they started using mobile banking technology , " @entity5 said			0
