@entity1 's journey was a tough one : dangerous , but also eye - opening			1
the author traveled deep into @entity6 territory -- the area they now call their " caliphate " -- visiting @entity10 and @entity11 in @entity12 , as well as @entity13 in @entity14			1
@entity13 , @entity14 's second largest city , was taken by @entity6 in a blitzkrieg - like sweep in june			1
@entity1 managed to visit the mosque there where the leader of @entity6 , @entity18 , gave his only public address			1
and he saw the realities of daily life under @entity6 , with all shops having to close for prayers in the middle of the day			1
" there is an awful sense of normalcy in @entity13 , " @entity1 said in an exclusive interview with @entity2			1
" 130,000 @entity31 have been evicted from the city , the @entity30 have fled , many people have been murdered and yet the city is functioning and people actually like the stability that the @entity34 has brought them			2
" nonetheless , he says , there is an air of fear among residents : " of course many of the them are quite scared , because the punishment for breaking the @entity34 's strict rules is very severe			2
" according to @entity6 's leadership , the group 's fighters managed to take @entity13 with only about 300 men , even though more than 20,000 @entity14 army soldiers were stationed there when the attack was launched			1
@entity1 spoke with several @entity6 fighters who took part in the operation			1
" it took us about four days to take @entity13 , " a young fighter told him			2
" so you were only about 300 men and you defeated 20,000 troops in four days ? " @entity1 asked			1
" well , we did n't attack them all at once , we hit their front lines hard , also using suicide attacks			0
then the others fled very quickly , " the fighter explained			0
" we fight for @entity65 , they fight for money and other things that they do not really believe in			0
" glow in their eyes @entity1 told @entity2 the enthusiasm the @entity6 militants showed was one thing that stood out			1
" when we stayed at their recruitment house , there were 50 new fighters who came every day , " @entity1 said			1
" and i just could not believe the glow in their eyes			0
they felt like they were coming to a promised land , like they were fighting for the right thing			0
" these are not stupid people			0
one of the people we met had just finished his law degree , he had great job offers , but he turned them down to go and fight ... we met fighters from @entity93 and the @entity94			2
one of them was from @entity96			0
can you imagine a man from @entity96 traveling to fight for the @entity34 ? " he went on to say that one of @entity6 's main points of strength is their fighters ' willingness -- even their will -- to die on the battlefield			1
@entity1 met one somewhat overweight recruit in a " safe house " who said he wears a suicide belt to every battle because he is too chubby to run away if he is cornered and would choose to blow himself up , rather than be captured			1
@entity6 also has a track record of abusing , torturing and executing prisoners of war			1
@entity1 was briefly able to speak to a @entity115 captive while in @entity13			1
the captive claimed he had not been tortured , but @entity1 said he found that hard to believe			1
" this was a broken man , " @entity1 said			1
" it was very sad to see a person in this state			0
he was just very weak and very afraid of his captors			0
" @entity1 conducted the interview with the prisoner while several @entity6 fighters stood guard			1
he asked the man whether he knew what would happen to him			0
" i do not know , " the captive told him			2
" my family does not even know i am still alive			0
i hope that maybe there will be some sort of prisoner exchange			0
" child @entity6 fighters @entity1 was also taken to see child soldiers outfitted with @entity34 gear and brandishing ak - 47s			1
one of the boys seemed very young but claimed he had already gone to battle for @entity6			1
" how old are you ? " @entity1 asked			2
" i am 13 years old , " the boy replied -- though he looked even younger than that			0
one of the most remarkable episodes of @entity1 's trip to the @entity6 - controlled region came when he was able to conduct an interview with a @entity149 fighter who spoke on behalf of @entity6 's leadership			1
the man -- clearly unapologetic about the group 's transgressions -- vowed there was more to come ; he also issued a warning to @entity93 and the @entity94			0
" so you also want to come to @entity93 ? " @entity1 asked him			2
" no , we will conquer @entity93 one day , " the man said			0
" it is not a question of if we will conquer @entity93 , just a matter of when that will happen			0
but it is certain ... for us , there is no such thing as borders			0
there are only front lines			0
" our expansion will be perpetual ... and the @entity93 need to know that when we come , it will not be in a nice way			0
it will be with our weapons			0
and those who do not convert to @entity175 or pay the @entity175 tax will be killed			0
" @entity1 asked the fighter about their treatment of other religions , especially @entity30			2
" what about the 150 million shia , what if they refuse to convert ? " @entity1 asked			2
" 150 million , 200 million or 500 million , it does not matter to us , " the fighter answered			0
" we will kill them all			0
" beheadings the interview became testy when they reached the topic of beheadings and enslavement , especially of female captives			2
" so do you seriously think that beheadings and enslavement actually signal progress for humanity ? " @entity1 asked			1
" slavery absolutely signals progress , " the man said			2
" only ignorant people believe that there is no slavery among the @entity31 and the @entity205			2
of course there are woman who are forced into prostitution under the worst circumstances			0
" i would say that slavery is a great help to us and we will continue to have slavery and beheadings , it is part of our religion ... many slaves have converted to @entity175 and have then been freed			1
" the @entity6 spokesman blamed the beheading of captured @entity221 journalists and aid workers on the policies of the @entity94			1
" people should really think about the case of @entity226 , " he said			0
" he did not get killed because we started the battle			2
he got killed because of the ignorance of his government that did not give him any help			0
" even with recent gains by @entity115 forces against @entity6 in northern @entity14 , @entity1 sees the extremist group as entrenched , building state institutions , and that it shows no sign of losing its grip in the main areas it controls in @entity14 and @entity12			1
" i think the @entity34 is a lot more dangerous than @entity221 leaders realize , " he said			0
" they believe in what they are fighting for and are preparing the largest religious cleansing campaign the world has ever seen			1
" read more : fighting for @entity248 -- from a distance read more : @entity250 now calling @entity6 " @entity251 " read more : @entity6 : enslaving ' unbelieving ' women ok			2

one @entity6 spokesman told @entity265 : " slavery and beheadings *[* are *]* part of our religion "
