-- a three - judge federal appeals panel has ruled that @entity3 shooting suspect @entity2 can refuse anti-psychotic medication			1
tuesday 's ruling comes days after the court said it would review an appeal by attorneys for the government who argued the alleged gunman should be forced to take anti-psychotic drugs for his behavior			1
the federal appeals court last week temporarily halted the forced medication			0
" since @entity2 has not been convicted of a crime , he is presumptively innocent and is therefore entitled to greater constitutional protections than a convicted inmate , " court documents said			1
" while both interests are significant , we conclude that preserving the dignity and bodily integrity of an individual who has not been convicted of a crime is the stronger interest , especially when the government has demonstrated that it is able to prevent that individual from harming himself or others			0
" @entity2 is being held in a federal mental hospital after an earlier court ruling found him incompetent to stand trial			2
the hospital 's medical staff began forcing him to take psychotropic medication after it deemed him to be a danger to himself and others			2
he is charged with killing six people -- including the chief federal judge of @entity41 , @entity40 -- in a supermarket parking lot in @entity3 , @entity41 , on january 8			0
among the 13 people wounded was @entity45 rep. @entity44 , @entity41 , who was shot in the head			1
on may 25 , a judge found @entity2 incompetent to stand trial and committed him to federal custody for hospitalization at the @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 , where the staff will determine whether @entity2 will become competent in the foreseeable future and , if so , oversee his mental restoration			0
