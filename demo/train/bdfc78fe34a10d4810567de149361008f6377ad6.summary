-- scientists say they have proven the existence of the @entity3 -- a never - before - seen subatomic particle long thought to be a fundamental building block of the universe			1
since 2012 researchers have made great strides in the hunt for the so - called " @entity11 particle " at the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , where scientists at the @entity17 particle physics laboratory are looking for particles that slip into existence when subatomic particles crash into one another at high energies			1
experts say finding the elusive particle would rank as one of the top scientific achievements of the past 50 years -- a view proved on tuesday when @entity30 and @entity31 , the two physicists who predicted almost 50 years ago that the particle existed , won the @entity32			2
what is the @entity3 ? the @entity34 of particle physics lays out the basics of how elementary particles and forces interact in the universe			1
but the theory crucially fails to explain how particles actually get their mass. particles , or bits of matter , range in size and can be larger or smaller than atoms			0
electrons , protons and neutrons , for instance , are the subatomic particles that make up an atom			0
scientists believe that the @entity3 is the particle that gives all matter its mass. read more : the woman at the edge of physics experts know that elementary particles like quarks and electrons are the foundation upon which all matter in the universe is built			1
they believe the elusive @entity3 gives the particles mass and fills in one of the key holes in modern physics			2
how does the @entity3 work ? the @entity3 is part of a theory first proposed by @entity31 and others in the 1960s to explain how particles obtain mass. the theory proposes that a so - called @entity31 energy field exists everywhere in the universe			1
as particles zoom around in this field , they interact with and attract @entity31 bosons , which cluster around the particles in varying numbers			0
imagine the universe like a party			0
relatively unknown guests at the party can pass quickly through the room unnoticed ; more popular guests will attract groups of people ( the @entity3 ) who will then slow their movement through the room			0
the speed of particles moving through the @entity31 field works much in the same way			0
certain particles will attract larger clusters of @entity3 -- and the more @entity31 bosons a particle attracts , the greater its mass will be			2
why is finding the @entity3 so important ? while finding the @entity3 wo n't tell us everything we need to know about how the universe works , it will fill in a huge hole in the @entity34 that has existed for more than 50 years , according to experts			1
" the @entity3 is the last missing piece of our current understanding of the most fundamental nature of the universe , " @entity111 , a physicist at @entity112 in @entity113 , told @entity0			1
" only now with the @entity12 [ @entity12 ] are we able to really tick that box off and say ' this is how the universe works , or at least we think it does '			1
" " it 's not the be all and end all -- but in terms of what can we say practically about the world and how the world is , it actually tells us a lot			0
" @entity127 , director of the @entity128 , added that finding evidence of the @entity3 would be a " very wonderful success of science and of people for four centuries			2
" why is the @entity3 called the " @entity11 particle ? " the popular nickname for the elusive particle was created for the title of a book by @entity32 winning physicist @entity139 -- reportedly against his will , as @entity139 has said he wanted to call it the " @entity142 " because " nobody could find the thing			1
" " ' @entity11 particle ' is a nickname i do n't really like , " says @entity111			1
" it 's nothing to do with religion -- the only ( theoretical ) similarity is you 're seeing something that 's a field that 's everywhere , in all spaces			0
" how are scientists searching for the @entity3 ? for the past 18 months scientists have searched for the @entity3 by smashing protons together at high energy in the $ 10 billion @entity12 ( @entity12 ) at @entity17 in @entity13 , @entity14			2
inside the @entity12 , which is located 328 feet underground in a 17 - mile tunnel and is the most powerful particle accelerator ever built , high speed proton collisions generate a range of even smaller particles that scientists sift through in search of a signal in the data suggesting the existence of the @entity3			1
" you 're just hoping that somewhere in these collisions that you see something ... some sort of a statistical bump , " says @entity111			0
so @entity31 bosons exist , but are elusive , popping up and then disappearing again quickly			0
it means , says @entity111 , that scientists at the @entity12 are only able to observe their decaying remnants			0
information from @entity0 wires and @entity0 's @entity182 blog was used in this report .			0

scientists say they *'ve* found new evidence the @entity3 exists
the so - called " @entity11 particle " is thought to be a building block of the universe
the theoretical particle is key to understanding how universe works , experts say
