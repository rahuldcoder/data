-- when @entity2 left prison in 2012 after serving four years on marijuana - related charges , he realized he had gained something more than his freedom : insight into an overlooked consumer market			2
many inmates are stuck in an age before @entity11 or @entity12 , relying on envelopes and pay phones to connect with family on the outside			2
so @entity2 founded @entity17 , a photo - sharing and low - cost phone call service that has already helped 50,000 incarcerated individuals connect with their loved ones , maintain their ties to society , and remain a presence in their children 's lives			2
the story of @entity28 is statistically unlikely : a disruptive technology created by a member of a disenfranchised community , in order to solve a problem within that community			2
it is also a model for the type of entrepreneurship that can revive @entity40 capitalism : both inclusive of and responsive to @entity40 's changing demographics			1
one of the great achievements of the civil rights and women 's rights movements was that they unleashed an enormous pool of talent into the economic life of @entity40			1
desegregation and the women 's movement broke down barriers to education and employment and made our nation stronger by making it more competitive			2
yet 50 years later , a narrow vision of capitalism once again threatens to leave many @entity40 behind			1
our nation 's failure to achieve equal educational opportunity has exacerbated race - based economic disparities and produced two starkly different @entity40 economies			1
and while women have made strong gains in professional life , they remain dramatically underrepresented in many of the most profitable sectors			0
@entity71 is hardly the only place where this is evident , but addressing it here is crucial to turning the tide			0
last year there were eight states where zero @entity79 students took the @entity81 exam in computer science , and 11 states in which no black students took the test			0
in three states , not a single female student sat for the exam			0
it is no surprise , then , that 99 % of venture capital - funded startups in 2010 were founded by whites or people of @entity96 descent , the vast majority of whom were men			1
the result of this pipeline problem is an enormous amount of untapped talent and a tech sector that fails to reflect the demographics of its users			1
to be sure , government can play a crucial role in leveling the playing field			0
but it can only go so far			0
the leaders of the innovation economy can and should play their part in reviving capitalism by making it more responsive to a changing country 's full range of widespread needs and more inclusive in the process			1
this is a practical demand as much as a moral one			0
underrepresented populations are uniquely prepared to do what the tech sector claims to do best : innovate			1
look at the app store on any smartphone			0
there are thousands of programs to edit a photo or help you check the weather , but far fewer that exist to close the gaps in our society			0
in @entity71 , we like to say that every problem is a potential opportunity			0
but it takes a diversity of backgrounds to identify the real - world problems begging for a solution			1
simply put , startups like @entity28 are shattering expectations of what the market demands			1
smart investors are looking at firms like @entity148 , which helps immigrants send cash remittances back to their home countries , or @entity152 , a @entity79 - founded multilingual education software platform that helps parents track their children 's ' school progress in their native language			2
our firm , @entity158 , invests in these companies and dozens of others that work to close gaps			0
we saw that startups like @entity28 were launched by entrepreneurs who identified an unmet need in the market as a result of their life experiences			1
@entity71 tells an idealistic story of itself and the revolutionary role of tech leaders in the 21st century economy			2
tech innovation can and should expand wealth , democratize access to opportunity , and build a meritocracy where talent matters most			1
however , we still have a long way to go			0
we will be there when companies like @entity17 , @entity148 , and @entity152 and their founders -- african - americans , latinos , women of all colors , and others historically excluded -- are no longer the exception to the rule			0
capitalism remains our nation 's operating system			1
the current version needs an upgrade			1
investing in the people who are too often locked out , and their ideas , can advance our economy and our country to the next level			0
join us on @entity12 / @entity201 .			0

@entity203 and @entity204 worry that a lack of diversity in tech firms is *stalling* innovation
startups *succeed* , they say , when they meet unmet needs
innovators from diverse backgrounds can *uncover* fresh , *unsolved* problems
@entity191 , they say , is @entity40 operating system but current version needs an upgrade
