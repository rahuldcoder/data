" my tv program was abruptly taken off the air after prime minister @entity5 targeted me in his election campaign speech in the city of @entity143 in may 2011 , " @entity135 wrote , in a letter printed by the committee			1
she credited @entity5 's @entity145 with removing " the hegemony of the military , " which has overthrown at least four governments in the past 50 years			0
but she also accused @entity5 's government of generating " authoritarian policies in milder forms and under different brands			2
" those sentiments were echoed by journalist @entity154			0
an early supporter of legal investigations into an alleged terrorist network of ultranationalists with the aim of militarily overthrowing @entity5 's government , @entity154 is currently being tried for writing a book allegedly at the behest of the same organization			2
his book , an expose of the infiltration of the police department by adherents of a particular brand of @entity167 , was banned and police raided newspaper offices to collect copies of it			0
@entity154 was released last march after being detained for more than a year , but the court case against him is ongoing and the journalists he was arrested alongside of are still in jail			0
in a phone interview with @entity1 on monday , @entity154 said his arrest was meant " to send the message : if we can arrest even these people , then we can definitely come after you			0
" @entity5 defended his record in a @entity1 interview broadcast last month			0
he was asked by @entity183 , who is also a member of the @entity14 ' board of directors , whether it is off limits in @entity6 to criticize the prime minister			1
" for the last 10 years , i have been fighting against criticism in very harsh terms , " @entity5 responded , speaking through an interpreter			0
" i 've been very patient , but i was not patient from time to time , and i had to actually file a lawsuit against those critics			0
but after a while , i withdrew my applications and i gave up on my rights , let 's say			0
but insult is one thing ; criticism is another thing			0
i will never put up with insult			0
but i will always say yes and put up with criticism			0
" last july , @entity5 's government passed an amendment that reduced penalties some journalists face for their work			1
" this new legal feature would effectively serve as an amnesty for press - related offenses and would affect a significant number of cases concerning journalists in @entity6 , " wrote @entity208 , @entity6 's ambassador to the @entity209 , in a letter to the @entity14			1
but the amendment did nothing to change @entity6 's much - criticized anti-terrorism law , which has been invoked repeatedly to prosecute critics of the government			1
" the big mental block in @entity6 , unfortunately , is the extraordinary breadth of the terrorist definition : it goes far beyond what anyone in the @entity227 would say is terrorism , " said @entity225 , senior @entity6 analyst with the @entity88 , a non-profit conflict mediation organization			2
" it is very out of date and prosecutors are using it , apparently , with a free pass from the ruling party , who could change the law if they wanted			0
" @entity154 , the investigative reporter facing charges of participating in a plot to overthrow the government , believes that press freedom in @entity6 is not possible until the anti-terror statutes are thrown out completely and the criminal code is brought fully in line with that of the @entity227			2
for now , @entity154 said , " journalists have two options : either go to jail or overlook injustices in the interest of self - preservation			0
