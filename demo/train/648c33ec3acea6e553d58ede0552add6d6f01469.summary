@entity0 reacted with outrage wednesday to news of a plea deal for a @entity5 squad leader charged in connection with the deaths of 24 people , in which he received a rank reduction and pay cut but avoided jail time			1
the november 2005 killings in @entity15 , @entity0 , constituted one of the worst attacks on civilians by @entity20 troops during the @entity0 war			1
the deaths enraged @entity0 , put a spotlight on the conduct of the @entity20 military and was compared to @entity27 's @entity26 by one congressman			1
on tuesday , staff sgt. @entity29 was sentenced to a maximum of 90 days in prison , but avoided any time in the brig because of a plea deal			1
the military judge was obligated to abide by the arrangement between prosecutors and defense attorneys , which amounts to a reduction in rank -- to private -- and a pay cut			1
" this court is unjust and its decision was unfair for @entity0 people , " @entity41 , a lecturer at @entity42 in @entity43 , said wednesday as he visited @entity44			1
" this soldier should be executed			1
the verdict is unfair and unjust for the innocent people who were killed in this incident			0
" " this is very sad and very painful , " said @entity52 , a store owner in @entity44			0
" they were just civilian people who did not raise weapons against the occupiers and they were killed this way			0
this is a heinous crime and the soldiers should get the most severe punishment			0
" @entity29 , 31 , of @entity61 , @entity62 , originally faced 152 years in prison on nine counts of involuntary manslaughter , two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and three counts of dereliction of duty in the @entity15 incident			0
he wound up pleading guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty			0
charges against six other @entity5 charged in the case were dropped , and another was acquitted			1
@entity29 's sentence was a " big disappointment , " @entity78 , political adviser to the governor of @entity0 's @entity82 province , said tuesday			1
" i ca n't believe that the court decided to drop all the charges except one charge			2
... this is a joke , because according to the @entity0 law , all those soldiers should be executed			1
we demand from the @entity20 administration to reconsider the court decision			1
" @entity91 also said the @entity20 government should compensate the victims ' families			1
" why is @entity20 blood so precious while the @entity0 blood is so cheap ? " @entity97 , an employee with @entity0 's @entity98 , said wednesday			1
... the @entity0 government should take a strong position and protest the court 's verdict right now			1
" " we have been following this case since 2006 and we were hoping that those soldiers , who killed 24 innocent people , will receive fair punishment , " @entity104 , head of the @entity15 local council , told @entity106 tuesday			0
" but now we are convinced that the judicial system in @entity20 is unjust , " he said			1
" this is not the end , and we will continue pursuing those soldiers legally through the international courts			0
" " the @entity0 government should appoint lawyers and send them to the international courts because these courts have a fair and neutral judicial system , unlike the @entity20 judicial system , " @entity52 said wednesday			1
an expert on @entity20 military law said a public explanation is needed regarding the case 's resolution			1
" the trial counsel and convening authority has a duty to explain this pretrial agreement in order to safeguard public confidence in the administration of justice , " said @entity125 , senior research scholar and a visiting lecturer at @entity127			2
under the military justice system , he said , the " convening authority , " a unit commander , makes the central decision			2
" the prosecution and staff judge advocate play an advisory role , " he said			0
" at the end of the day , it 's the commander 's decision to accept or reject a proposed pretrial agreement			0
" about the investigation into the so - called @entity15 massacre , @entity125 said : " it does seem that a set of cases that began with some pretty terrible allegations has basically fizzled			0
the public ought to have confidence in the administration of justice			2
" the plea agreement was " unjust , " according to @entity158 lawmaker @entity157 , as the @entity5 " committed mass killings in @entity15			1
" " we ask the human rights organizations and ( nongovernmental organizations ) in @entity20 and all over the world to strongly condemn this verdict			1
@entity0 blood is n't so cheap , " @entity157 said in a @entity166 posting tuesday			1
a @entity5 spokesman said a final adjudication will be made on the case by lt. gen. @entity171 , commander of @entity172 , but while he can reduce the sentence , he can not increase it			2
facing the judge in a @entity5 base courtroom tuesday , @entity29 , a divorced father of three young daughters , expressed no emotion			2
earlier in the day , he told the judge : " for six years , i have had to accept that my name will always be associated with a massacre , being a cold - blooded baby killer , an ' out of control ' monster , and a conspiring liar			0
there 's nothing i can do about whoever believes these things			0
" according to previous testimony and court records , @entity29 , who was assigned to @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , was the squad leader on november 19 , 2005 , when members of his patrol unit were moving a supply convoy through @entity15 , an insurgent stronghold where armed resistance fighters hid among the civilian population			0
an improvised explosive device exploded under a vehicle , killing @entity202 @entity201 , 20 , and injuring two other @entity5			2
during the more than two - week trial that ended with the plea deal , prosecutors argued @entity29 lost control after seeing the body of his friend blown apart by the bomb and led his men on a angry rampage , ordering his squad to " shoot first and ask questions later			1
" @entity29 's team stormed two nearby homes , blasting their way in with grenades and m - 16 rifle fire			0
among the dead was an elderly man in a wheelchair			2
when the 45 - minute incident was over , 24 men , women and children were dead			0
@entity29 was accused of ordering his men to storm the homes , part of what his attorney has said was a search for those believed responsible for planting the bomb and , later , shooting at the men			0
the prosecution contended the @entity5 were out for revenge			2
the case did n't come to light until january 2006 , when @entity238 broke the story			0
two months later , the military launched an investigation			0
@entity29 said tuesday that he never fired his weapon at any women or children			0
" when i told my team to shoot first and ask questions later , the intent was n't that they would shoot civilians , it was that they would not hesitate in the face of the enemy , " he said			0
to the victims ' families , he said , " words can not express my sorrow for the loss of your loved ones			0
" " many of the @entity5 who were there that day , along with everyone who has stood by me and supported me , may be disappointed that i pled guilty , " @entity29 said			2
" it might suggest that i believe we behaved badly or dishonorably			0
the truth is , i do n't believe anyone in my squad , nor any member of @entity270 , 3/1 behaved in any way that was dishonorable or contrary to the highest ideals that we all live by as @entity5			1
" the incident provoked the condemnation of the late rep. @entity275 , @entity276 , who compared it to the 1968 @entity26 , and then - president @entity278 , who vowed that if an investigation showed @entity5 killed unarmed civilians , " there will be a punishment			2

" this soldier should be executed , " one @entity0 man says
" @entity0 blood is n't so cheap , " a @entity158 lawmaker says
the @entity5 will have a reduced rank and a pay cut under the plea deal
