-- at first glance , it seems obvious -- of course @entity3 and @entity4 have the right to take down a video showing the @entity9 journalist , @entity8 , being beheaded			1
the question is why taking it down is controversial at all			0
the answer , i think , shows how important services like @entity3 have become , and how this has thrust unexpected responsibilities onto them			1
@entity3 and @entity4 both have rules telling users what they can and can not post , even though the volume of material they deal with necessarily means they 're inconsistent in the application of those rules			1
@entity4 's community guidelines go beyond saying that you ca n't post " bad stuff " that 's against the law , " like animal abuse , drug abuse , under - age drinking and smoking , or bomb making			1
" the site also wo n't let you post legal content that depicts " graphic or gratuitous violence			0
" @entity3 's rules are more minimal , explicitly forbidding only porn in your profile photos , threats and harassment , and spam			1
but , if @entity3 wants to add a new rule in response to a grotesquely violent posting , it 's perfectly within its rights to do so			2
that 's because @entity4 and @entity3 are private websites			1
they do n't have to post anything they do n't want to			0
you 'd feel the same way if you set up a site for people to post photos of their pets and someone started feeding it pictures of animals being beheaded			0
private sites have no obligation to support free speech			1
free speech in @entity9 means the government ca n't tell you what not to say in public			1
if you do n't like a private website 's rules , go somewhere else on the @entity75 or start your own site			0
that 's how it works and it 's how it should work			0
and yet , it feels different for sites the size of @entity3 and @entity4 than for a little pet photos site			1
our society has higher aspirations for free speech than that the government not censor us			1
we want a robust , vibrant public sphere in which ideas of every sort are welcomed and debated			0
and now we have the @entity91 , the greatest venue for free speech in human history			1
would you watch the video ? sort of			0
yes , anyone can talk on the @entity91			0
we 're no longer held back by the limited real estate of a daily newspaper or by the judgment of an editorial board			0
but talking on the @entity91 is like shouting into the ocean unless you find a place where there are lots of people ready to listen			0
@entity4 and @entity3 are just such places			1
not everyone will hear you , but your voice may not be totally drowned out , for these sites also provide ways for friends to connect with one another and with others who share their interests			0
that makes sites like @entity3 and @entity4 especially important to our society			1
their special role comes from what 's known as " the network effect " -- they gain value simply from the fact that there are so many people there			0
this also makes them difficult to replace , because it would require masses of people to move to a new site that at its start has very few people there to speak with			0
with a great network effect comes great responsibility			0
opinion : what is @entity141 hoping its abhorrent beheading video will achieve ? we look to @entity3 for special care in handling content fairly not only because free speech needs sites with lots of people , but also because @entity3 has begun to play a unique and remarkable role in the ecosystem of news so important to informing us as citizens			1
in one sense , @entity3 is just a distribution system for news , most of which has first appeared on a professional news site			2
but , as the tweets from @entity161 have shown , it has also become the leading platform where news breaks before it gets picked up by the professional media			0
@entity3 's stream of tweets is not only an amazing pool of eyewitness accounts of the sort compiled by journalists in their research , it is also a contextualized , socially refined end product			2
this puts a special responsibility on @entity3 to accept some of the norms of journalism			2
@entity3 is not a news site , but if it were caught removing conservative or liberal tweets , there would be a firestorm for violating a prime journalistic ethic			2
@entity3 has been vested with a responsibility , and a trust , it did not ask for			2
removing accounts responsible for propagating a video of the political murder of a journalist does not violate that trust ; the national news sites also are not linking to that video			2
but the fact that we even wonder about @entity3 's social and journalistic responsibilities shows how deeply the @entity91 has transformed our social and media ecosystems .			1
