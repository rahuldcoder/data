-- after @entity3 's devastating earthquake , @entity1 picked up @entity5 's oil - on - cardboard painting like a father would a wounded child			1
he could barely hold back his tears			0
" @entity9 , " glorious in its art naif simplicity , lay before him like a complicated jigsaw puzzle			0
pieces were frazzled , some were even missing			0
like so many other things in @entity3 , the painting by one of @entity3 's foremost artists was gone			1
a masterpiece lost , and with it a part of @entity3 's history			2
no one would ever be able to put it together , @entity1 believed , as he fished through a demolished museum in @entity26 that housed 12,000 pieces of art collected by his family			1
each told the history and aspirations of a people who survived hardship and expressed themselves through painting and sculpture			0
with few functioning institutions or the kinds of buildings and monuments found in wealthier nations , depictions of sun and sea , people and animals by untrained artists -- some infused with the spiritual traditions of voodoo culture -- came to serve as @entity3 's collective memory			1
@entity5 , a voodoo priest and self - taught artist , painted with his fingers and with brushes made of chicken feathers			2
on friday , @entity1 will stand again before @entity5 's 1946 still life , its brilliant hues brought back to life by conservators working with the @entity61			1
" i think it 's a miracle , " @entity1 said			2
the painting is one of two restored works of art that is part of a larger show of 50 pieces created by @entity3 artists -- the other rescued piece is " @entity72 " by @entity73			1
" @entity74 : a celebration of @entity78 " was organized by @entity75 and curated by leading @entity3 art historian @entity76			1
@entity76 , like his longtime friend @entity1 , said the exhibit meant the world to him , a potent symbol of @entity3 's rebirth , especially amid cries that recovery efforts after the earthquake has been too slow			1
" this is the identity of the @entity3 people , " @entity76 said			0
" if we let this go , the next generation in @entity3 will not know where they came from			0
it was a duty we had to fulfill			0
" in the immediate aftermath of earthquake , @entity1 and other art collectors in @entity3 rescued thousands of pieces from the rubble that might have been forever lost			1
in just one room of his museum , he salvaged 1,000 pieces -- 70 percent needed restorative work			1
it was hard to quantify the loss , @entity1 said , because unlike in the @entity107 , @entity3 lacked a plethora of museums and galleries			1
much of the nation 's treasure existed in private homes , in private collections like the one his father built when he began collecting decades ago			2
no one knew for certain how many pieces were lost			0
as the second floor of his gallery transformed into a hospital ward for art , @entity1 was determined to make them all well again			2
he and @entity76 began making phone calls , knocking on doors			0
it would take people with tremendous expertise to perform intricate surgery on delicate paintings and objects to make them whole again			0
they found a partner at the @entity61 and the result was the @entity133 , which recently opened in conjunction with the @entity3 government in the hills of @entity26			1
@entity3 's cultural heritage , like @entity139 's lions in the wild , were endangered			2
the center 's mission was to protect that heritage			0
@entity144 , under - secretary for history , art and culture at the @entity61 , said it would have been unconscionable to leave art under the rubble			2
he said the recovery center is " magically " restoring thousands of pieces that were damaged			2
the center is also training @entity3 how to conserve			0
a course in september taught 26 participants how to identify deterioration agents , apply first aid treatment , prepare and respond to emergencies and create safe storage spaces for collections			0
" i think we look at the restoration of art as the restoration of hope , " he said			0
" by restoring the past you are giving people access to their heritage			0
" @entity172 , the director of @entity75 in @entity173 admitted she did n't know much about @entity3 art before she took on the " @entity74 " exhibit			1
but the gallery wanted to make a contribution to @entity3 's recovery			1
" we wanted to give @entity3 art , the @entity3 people , a voice , " she said about " @entity74 , " the first such show of @entity3 art in the @entity107 in over a decade			1
many of the pieces have previously not been seen outside @entity3			0
@entity1 hopes those who relish the visual feast will gather an understanding of the vital role that art plays in @entity3 society			1
and why it is incumbent on @entity3 to bring back what an earthquake buried last january .			0

a still life painting by @entity3 artist @entity5 was damaged in the earthquake
gallery owner @entity1 wanted to have it -- and thousands of other pieces -- restored
in a troubled land , art serves a vital role as the nation 's memory
the @entity3 government has been working with the @entity61 on restoration
' @entity74 , ' a show of 50 pieces of @entity3 art , opens in @entity173 on friday
