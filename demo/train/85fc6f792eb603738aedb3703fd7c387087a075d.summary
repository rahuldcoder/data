@entity0 -- rapid advances in communications are eroding police departments ' abilities to conduct wiretaps , and @entity7 needs to take steps to ensure that new telephone , computer and wireless systems are designed to allow lawful police access , @entity13 and police officials told @entity7 thursday			1
but other witnesses cautioned that any such move could stifle innovation , place @entity20 technology companies at a competitive disadvantage and unintentionally create systems vulnerable to hackers , criminals and terrorists			1
at issue is the diminished capability of law enforcement agencies to conduct quick wiretaps in an age of @entity32 accounts , @entity34 and @entity35 pages , @entity31 , @entity36 , iphones and @entity38			2
the @entity39 calls the phenomenon " going dark			2
" in testimony before a @entity44 subcommittee , @entity13 general counsel @entity41 said it is " exponentially more difficult " to execute court - authorized wiretaps on new technology , noting that criminals can now communicate using wireless devices and anonymous avatars			1
@entity41 said the @entity13 is not seeking additional authority to conduct wiretaps , but rather is looking for solutions to technical problems the agency encounters in conducting court - authorized intercepts			1
the @entity60 administration currently has no proposal to increase the technological ease of wiretapping , she said , but she added that one may be coming soon			2
a 1994 law , the @entity65 , required telephone companies to build in the means to conduct intercepts			2
but the law was designed to keep pace with changes in telecommunications , not in internet - based communications services , and is now antiquated , she said			1
as an example , @entity41 cites a 2009 case in which a pimp used a social networking site to entice children into prostitution			0
investigators had enough evidence for a court - ordered wiretap , but did not seek one because the website did not provide a means of conducting electronic surveillance , she wrote			1
" there are a lot of things that keep me up at night			1
one thing is the privacy of people who are communicating on the @entity93 , " @entity41 said			0
" but i also get kept up by worrying that we 've got criminals running around that we ca n't arrest and ca n't prosecute because we ca n't actually execute a wiretap order			0
and that criminal may be a massive drug dealer			0
they may be an arms trafficker			0
they may be a child pornographer or a child molester			0
" i worry about things like a @entity106 - style attack where , @entity108 forbid , the attackers are using communications modalities that we do n't have an interception ( for )			1
" but another witness told the committee moves to change technology come with risks of their own			1
" switches " designed to give police wiretapping capabilities were hacked in @entity117 , leading to the unlawful wiretapping of 100 senior government officials for 10 months , and a system was breached in @entity121 , allowing unlawful wiretaps of 6,000 @entity121 , said @entity126 of @entity128 's @entity127			1
another concern is stifling innovation			1
" the person in the dorm room building the next great app may never build it if they have to comply with a government imposed mandate , " said @entity131 of the @entity132			0
" they might not even think about building the next great application			0
and if they did they might have to re-architect it in a way that would be less efficient , less useful to users than it would have been if they had been able to build according to what they wanted to do			0
" @entity131 also takes issue with the idea that the law enforcement is " going dark			0
" " wiretapping is at record levels , " he said			0
" there were more wiretaps placed in 2009 by federal and state officials than ever in history			0
for each of the thousands of wiretaps that are placed , over 3,000 communications are intercepted			0
that 's not an @entity13 going dark			1
that 's an awful lot of light			2
" @entity1 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			2

new technology is giving *suspects* the edge over authorities , an @entity13 official says
" i worry about things like a @entity106 - style attack , " the @entity13 's general counsel says
but changes might bring security risks and stifle innovation , *critics* tell a @entity44 panel
