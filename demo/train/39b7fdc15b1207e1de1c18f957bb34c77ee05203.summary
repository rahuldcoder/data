-- if your post-thanksgiving shopping plans do n't involve leaving the house , you 're in increasingly good company			2
and web sellers are saying , " step right in			2
" as more people do at least some of their holiday shopping online every year , retailers are looking to take advantage of digital deal - seekers -- not just on the much - ballyhooed cyber monday , but on @entity13 and even @entity14			1
@entity15 , the online analytics firm , is predicting that online spending is going to increase yet again this holiday season			1
so far this november , $ 9.7 billion has been spent online , @entity15 estimated , marking a 14 % increase versus the corresponding days last year			1
wednesday , november 16 , has been the heaviest online spending day to date at $ 688 million			1
" with the persistent backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and continued high unemployment , consumers appear to be increasingly favoring the online benefits of convenience and lower prices , " said @entity15 chairman @entity20			2
" based on the expectation that these positive spending trends will continue for the season , this year promises to be a @entity31 indeed for online retailers			1
" the @entity33 says the average shopper plans to do about 36 % of their holiday shopping online , up from 32.7 % last year			1
and retailers are going after them aggressively			2
in a survey , 33 % of respondents told @entity15 they think they 've seen more online sales and bargains this year , while 45 % said it seems about the same			1
only 7 % said they 've seen fewer sales or promotions			0
the @entity33 says that more than nine in 10 retailers plan to offer free shipping for online orders at some time this season			1
and more than one - third say they 're offering free shipping earlier this year than last year			1
among digital shoppers , it 's perhaps not surprising that electronic gadgets appear at the top of the shopping list			0
consumer - electronics site @entity60 's polling results showed that almost one - third ( 32 % ) of its respondents will be searching for a deal on a tablet computer this year			0
in an interesting twist that might point to the future of the tablet market , the same number of people said they hope to get a @entity70 this year ( 10 % ) as said they want an @entity72			1
the $ 199 @entity73 actually finished slightly ahead of the @entity72 , which starts at $ 499 , among men in the survey			1
high - definition televisions were next at 25 % , with laptops and smartphones following close behind			0
@entity60 has n't just been polling shoppers , either			0
their gadget folks have rounded up some lists to help with your online shopping this holiday -- particularly on @entity13			0
they 've assembled a list of online deals to watch for , as well as a list of online " duds " that might not be so attractive			1
they like a 55 - inch @entity91 for $ 1,099 at @entity92 and the @entity94 tablet ( running @entity95 ) for $ 299 from @entity96 , among other potential bargains			0
not so attractive ? @entity98 says a 55 - inch plasma tv going for $ 600 at @entity92 is already available for $ 100 less elsewhere , and a @entity101 blu - ray player being offered for as low as $ 39 on some sites requires a $ 49 adapter if you want it to run @entity106			0
and this year , bargains may be increasingly creeping in front of potential shoppers via social - media			2
retailers are using their @entity113 and @entity114 accounts , among others , to reach out to shoppers			2
examples ? @entity117 is hosting a quiz on its @entity113 page , offering a 20 - percent - off coupon for people who take it			0
in addition to listing specials , @entity124 's page has a " so wrong , @entity132 " contest that lets fans submit a picture of a terrible give for a chance to win a much better one			0
and @entity92 is using @entity114 , as well as @entity113 , to let customers vote on which items they 'd like to see on sale on @entity13			0
" brands are starting to see that this word - of - mouth scale really works and creates a bigger sense of urgency to purchase , " @entity136 , a spokeswoman for @entity113 , told @entity137 .			0

more retailers are offering deals for online shoppers , experts say
@entity33 predicts web spending will be up this year
survey : online shoppers just as likely to want a @entity70 as an @entity72
while there are good deals to be found , look out for duds , as well
