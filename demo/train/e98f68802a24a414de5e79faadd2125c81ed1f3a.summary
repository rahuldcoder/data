editor 's note : @entity2 is the associate editor of @entity3			0
he is also an @entity4 pundit for @entity7 's @entity6 show and writes blogs for @entity9			1
( @entity3 ) -- now we have seven different winners from the first seven races of the @entity4 season			1
there 's never been anything like it in the history of the sport			0
whether it will become eight from eight in @entity20 this weekend is anyone 's guess			2
the latest beneficiary in the on - track " lottery " was @entity25 in @entity26 , five years on from his first @entity4 win at the same circuit			1
but the only thing really surprising about the result was that it took so long for the 2008 world champion to get his name on the 2012 winners ' list			1
who would have thought that @entity38 ' pastor @entity37 would win a race before @entity25 this year ? maybe a few people after the @entity41 's performance in 2011 -- the year that he was seemingly driving a magnet to @entity44 's car , such were the number of times the two collided			1
it was the year of the deep depression , when off - track woes became on - track nightmares			2
okay , he won two races , in @entity55 and @entity56 , but @entity58 teammate @entity57 won three			1
a new management company in the shape of @entity62 's @entity61 -- other customers : the @entity64 , @entity65 and former @entity67 pop idol winner @entity66 -- did little to ease the minds of @entity25 ' fans and team			1
latest f1 standings ahead of @entity73 @entity72 what was happening to the man who walked into the @entity76 in 2007 as if he had been racing there for years ? why the sudden downturn in performance from the record - setting racer who finished on the podium in his first nine f1 races ? " with both our drivers , with @entity25 and @entity88 , they have a continued drive to learn , " @entity58 's managing director @entity83 told me when i quizzed him on the subject			1
" it 's just part of the learning process			0
it 's been commented on ... the process has been gradual , the process of taking life 's knocks			0
" @entity25 has adapted progressively and it 's very easy -- as we all know -- when you 're on a roll to build yourself a virtuous spiral , confidence will get you a long way			2
likewise , when it goes the other way you can get a dose of the jitters			0
the difference between success and failure is really small			0
" it 's an enormous pressure on young people to have the white heat of public scrutiny and media attention on you			0
when you look at some of these drivers -- whether it 's @entity25 or ( @entity121 ) @entity120 -- look at what we 're expecting of them week in , week out			2
it 's a huge ask			0
" nothing can prepare you for that			0
the innate talent was in there with @entity25 , but you 've still got to survive the ravages of the pit lane			2
" @entity135 chief backs tire critic @entity136 this year , though , we seem to have the old @entity25 back			1
the one who would go half a second faster than anyone else in qualifying			0
he did this at last month 's @entity144 @entity72 , but he was promptly , and some say ridiculously , dropped to the back of the grid for not having enough fuel in his car -- a large price to pay for a small misjudgment by @entity58			1
it was his reaction that proved to everyone , however , that @entity25 had sorted the problems that plagued his 2011 season			2
he did n't complain , he drove the wheels off the car and did n't make any contact on his way through the field to eighth place and four crucial points			0
the @entity26 @entity72 was remarkable in that @entity25 finally cracked his 2012 nut , but interesting too because he conserved his tires beautifully			1
his teammate , the one famous for being gentle on those @entity166 , could n't			2
@entity57 finished a lap behind in 16th at a circuit where , in 2011 , he climbed from the back of the grid to win the race on the last lap. @entity25 , meanwhile , was busy crashing into him			1
how @entity4 's roulette tables have turned			1
even stranger about @entity88 's recent performances is that he has no idea why he is so slow			0
he 's not blaming the tires -- take note @entity136 -- but neither is he blaming anything else			0
he simply does n't know where he 's losing the time			0
in his title - winning year of 2009 , @entity57 won six of the first seven races for @entity184 ; he could do no wrong , he was unbeatable			1
come the latter half of the season , though , he started to drop back down the field and could n't work out why			0
his teammate @entity189 was busy winning races in the same car , so clearly it was capable			2
in the end it mattered not -- he sealed the championship in @entity196 with a fifth - place finish , singing , very badly , " @entity200 " over the radio to his team			0
with the 2012 championship so tight , @entity57 will need to work out where it 's going wrong as soon as possible , otherwise he wo n't be singing any @entity204 numbers for a while			1
maybe that 's a good thing ? the future seems brighter for @entity25 , though			2
he 's arguably driving better now than he ever has , and the @entity58 should be capable of being on the podium at every race this year			1
if he keeps up his level of performance for the next 13 races anything is possible .			0

@entity4 circuit moves to @entity144 this weekend for @entity73 @entity72
@entity25 was the seventh winner from seven races so far in 2012
the 2008 world champion is back in form after struggling last year
he has turned the tables on @entity58 teammate @entity57 to lead standings
