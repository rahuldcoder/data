-- with time ticking by and an apparent dearth of clues , an eastern @entity2 family clung thursday to hopes of finding a 43 - year - old schoolteacher , last seen five days earlier out on a morning jog through her small town			2
an @entity11 official noted that investigators have received " dozens and dozens " of calls about @entity16 , agency spokeswoman @entity9 said thursday by e-mail			1
but the woman remains at large , and there are no named suspects in her disappearance			2
" our thoughts are focused on her , we want her to return , we want to get her back , " her husband , @entity22 , told @entity24 's @entity23 on thursday			1
" that 's what keeps hope alive			2
" @entity16 went running around 6:30 a.m. saturday , but never returned home , the @entity11 said			1
other than one of her running shoes that was found along her route , authorities have not indicated there 's been any sign of @entity22			1
this is despite an extensive search effort launched by authorities and aided by throngs of people around the area			1
@entity47 police chief @entity46 said earlier this week that teams had been using dogs and aircraft and have gotten help from @entity53 members as well as volunteers			2
@entity55 , 26 , a @entity57 contributor , said earlier this week that she went to the site of one of the searches , where thousands turned up to help			0
some set out on horses , others on atvs and more on foot covering " a lot of pasture , dirt roads and farmland			0
" @entity22 's disappearance has hit the small community hard , including at @entity73 , where she is a math teacher			1
situated near @entity75 and about 100 miles south of the @entity77 border , @entity47 has a population of just under 5,200 people , according to the @entity80			0
" everybody is involved , " said @entity55 , adding she does n't know @entity22 but still feels the impact			1
" we 're such a small community , and crime is absolutely unheard of , " @entity55 said			0
" we do n't lock our car doors			2
( we 're ) completely shocked			0
" but this type of extensive effort was called off wednesday , when the @entity11 announced that " law enforcement officials determined the prudent course of action is to scale back the ground search			1
" the focus , instead , will shift toward " other investigative efforts , " though the @entity11 did not specify in its statement what those would be			1
" i think the @entity11 is on top of it , as much as they can be , " said @entity22 , adding that he believed his wife 's running route has been " very , very thoroughly searched			1
" " they 're going to do the right thing and ask the right questions from the right people			0
we just need to get that one tip. " on thursday , the @entity11 put out a poster of @entity22 and added her to its " kidnapping and missing persons " website			1
it noted that she was wearing running clothes , mittens , earbuds and a grayish - blue @entity115 at the time of her disappearance			0
" we are hopeful this will generate more tips in the case , " @entity119 said			0
" our goal is to keep her information and picture out in the public			2
" frigid temperatures have heightened concerns			0
the low temperature thursday night in @entity47 was expected to dip to 15 degrees @entity130 , with daytime highs over the next two days forecast to be in the 30s , according to the @entity132			0
@entity22 said his wife 's disappearance has been " very difficult " on the couple 's children , though he said they are staying optimistic			1
" their mother has raised them well , " he said			0
" they are troupers , they are hanging in there , and they are not giving up hope either			0

@entity16 , 43 , went for a run on saturday and has n't been seen since
authorities found a lone shoe on her route but have n't *disclosed* anything else
the @entity11 says it has scaled back its search , even as it pleads for more information
@entity22 's husband says he trusts the @entity11 , adding simply , " we want her back "
