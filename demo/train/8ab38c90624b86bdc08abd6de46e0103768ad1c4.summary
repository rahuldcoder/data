@entity0 -- a @entity0 government minister on tuesday joined a growing chorus of people questioning the circumstances of the death last week of a prominent @entity8 dissident who was found hanged in his hospital room			1
dr. @entity10 , the @entity0 secretary for food and health , said in an interview with @entity1 affiliate @entity13 that the weak physical condition of @entity15 , a blind and deaf labor rights activist , made it hard to believe the hospital authorities ' claim that he had committed suicide			1
@entity10 also cited an interview that @entity15 gave to i - cable a few weeks before his death in which he expressed his commitment to promoting democracy in @entity8			1
" it seems that his character and personality are not of a person who is suicidal and are not of a person who would not have left a suicide note , " @entity10 said			0
he urged other officials to convey the feelings of @entity0 citizens about @entity15 's death to the @entity8 government in @entity38			1
@entity10 has said he will finish his term as health secretary in @entity0 when the territory 's new @entity38 - backed chief executive , @entity41 , takes over next month			2
friends of @entity15 have criticized official claims that he hanged himself at the hospital @entity46 , @entity47 , as " insulting " and " ridiculous			1
" they insist he was too weak to hang himself and was committed to continuing his activism			0
one friend , @entity49 , said last week that he had visited @entity15 at @entity50 in @entity46 a few days before his death on june 6 and found him in " good spirits			1
" @entity15 was blind , deaf and had trouble walking after spending more than 20 years in prison following the crackdown by the @entity8 authorities on protesters in @entity58 in 1989			1
he was one of @entity8 's first labor rights activists and was jailed shortly after the june 4 massacre in @entity58 for urging workers to strike , according to @entity62 in @entity8 ( @entity63 ) , a nongovernmental organization			1
after spending 11 years in jail , @entity15 was released in 2000 only to be imprisoned again in 2001 for doggedly petitioning @entity46 authorities to pay his medical expenses for injuries suffered through torture in prison			2
they refused and he was sentenced to a further 10 years for " incitement to subvert state power , " according to @entity63			0
he was released last year but his family said he had been under 24 - hour police surveillance in hospital			0
@entity15 's brother - in - law @entity76 told @entity63 that hospital staff phoned him and his wife , @entity15 's sister @entity78 , just after 6 a.m. on june 6 to tell them that @entity15 had committed suicide			1
@entity76 said they rushed to the hospital and found @entity15 's body " hanging by the window			1
" he noted that @entity15 's feet were still on the ground			2
" i 've never witnessed a suicide like this , " said @entity86 , communications director at @entity63			0
how do you hang yourself with your feet on the ground ? " despite the family 's claims that they were n't allowed to take photos of @entity15 's body , three images of him said to have been taken after his death have been published on @entity100 , a @entity102 - based @entity8 - language news website			2
two photos show @entity15 standing by a window with a knotted sheet around his neck , apparently tied to bars on a window above			2
a third photo shows @entity15 's feet firmly on the ground , still wearing slippers			2
@entity1 tried repeatedly to contact @entity112 where @entity15 died but no one answered the phone			2
an official who answered the phone at the publicity office of @entity118 said he had n't heard of @entity15 's case and advised calling another number			1
attempts to contact other government offices were also unsuccessful			0
it 's not known how long @entity15 had been in hospital before his death			1
@entity63 said only that he was being treated for his " deteriorating health			0
" @entity76 told @entity63 that the authorities started monitoring @entity15 on may 22			0
in the hours after @entity15 's death , a petition appeared online urging his " suicide " to be investigated by authorities outside @entity46 province and for the findings to be made public			0
it was started by @entity0 - based journalist @entity134 , @entity8 economist @entity135 and literary scholar @entity136			0
thousands of people have added their names to the petition , including many who listed their locations @entity8			0
a memorial service for @entity15 will be held wednesday evening in central @entity0 to mark the seventh day after his death			1
it will include a silent tribute as well as a pro-democracy song			0
protesters demanding an investigation into his death already carried out a demonstration in the city on sunday			0
@entity1 's @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
