the film , titled " @entity22 , " stars @entity0 and @entity23 as two lightweight talk show hosts recruited by the @entity25 to take out @entity7			1
it 's not due in theaters until october , but the trailer is already drawing worldwide attention , including in the corridors of power in @entity11			0

comedians taking shots at @entity2 's dictatorial leadership is hardly new -- it goes back at least a generation			1
a decade ago , " @entity31 : @entity55 " used puppets to lampoon @entity7 's father , @entity51 , memorably featuring him singing about his loneliness at the top of the despotic state			2
