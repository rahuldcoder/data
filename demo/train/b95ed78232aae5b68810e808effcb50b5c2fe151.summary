@entity0 -- a new @entity3 counterterrorism strategy released wednesday focuses on the ability of @entity5 and its network to inspire people in the @entity3 to attack the homeland , said @entity9 , @entity10 counterterrorism adviser			1
speaking at @entity11 , @entity9 said , " indeed , this is the first counterterrorism strategy that designates the homeland as a primary area of emphasis in our counterterrorism efforts			0
" he added , " we are doing everything in our power to prevent another terrorist attack on our soil			0
... it 's not enough to simply be prepared for attacks , we have to be resilient and recover quickly should an attack occur			2
" @entity9 said the ability to snap back quickly in the event of an attack would deny @entity5 " the economic damage and disruption it seeks			1
" he made it clear the administration wants to follow a strategy of drone strikes and targeted raids against terrorists and avoid prolonged wars			1
" @entity5 seeks to bleed us financially by drawing us into long , costly wars that also inflame anti-american sentiment , " he said			1
" our best offense wo n't always be deploying large armies abroad but delivering targeted , surgical pressure to the groups that threaten us			1
" the @entity3 ca n't go after every terrorist group and must focus attention on those that seek to harm the @entity3 , @entity9 said			2
he said @entity5 and its affiliates still represent the greatest danger , even after the may raid by @entity52 that killed @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55			0
@entity9 said the @entity3 wants to work with allies to bring terrorists down , but he would not rule out future unilateral strikes even in the territory of allies			1
" as the president has said repeatedly , if we have information about the whereabouts of @entity5 , we will do what is required to protect the @entity3 -- as we did with @entity53			1
" according to @entity9 , the cache of videos and writings seized at @entity53 's compound shows the @entity5 leader worried " @entity5 is losing the larger battle for hearts and minds			2
" @entity53 " knew that he had failed to portray @entity3 as being at war with @entity74 " and that had hampered efforts to recruit more muslims to his cause			0
@entity9 said @entity53 " called for more large - scale attacks against @entity3 , but encountered resistance from his followers and he went for years without seeing any spectacular attacks			0
" the president 's counterterrorism adviser questioned how well @entity88 will do as the new paramount leader of @entity5 , saying he " lacks @entity53 's charisma and perhaps the loyalty and respect of many in @entity5			1
" but @entity9 acknowledged @entity88 might try to launch new attacks to prove he and @entity5 are still relevant			0
@entity9 admitted there is a concern that @entity3 could become complacent since there has n't been a large - scale attack here since 9/11 and since @entity53 has been killed			2
but with the 10 - year anniversary of 9/11 coming soon , @entity9 said , " we want to make sure that we 're as vigilant and we 're as poised to detect and thwart these attacks			0
" he added @entity102 is well aware of the need to stay focused on the threat of terrorism .			0
