-- worried that her job might be cut in @entity4 , it professional @entity1 took a big step by deciding to work on the other side of the world in @entity8 , @entity9			1
@entity11 's high - tech company in @entity12 , @entity4 , was laying off people in her area of the business and hiring aggressively in @entity16			0
the 45 - year - old decided to take a job in @entity8 and move with her company , even though she could have eventually found work elsewhere in the @entity21			1
@entity11 's husband , @entity11 , a senior research and development manager , followed her to @entity9 with a job that has evolved into something " bigger " than his old one			1
in addition to their careers , @entity1 said the move was a chance at a " new and interesting " life experience for both of them , because they had never lived outside the @entity21 together			1
" i probably could have found another job in @entity12 , but it would have taken some time to find a position given my skill set and seniority , " @entity11 said			0
the couple , married 12 years , arrived in @entity9 with just three suitcases each ( and a small shipment of items ) and left their two adult children behind for their new overseas careers			1
so far , they 're glad they made the move two years ago and say , " it has been an amazing experience filled with a lot of adventure			0
" how common is the @entity53 ' story ? although it is encouraged , a @entity55 official said @entity21 working in @entity9 are not required to register their status with the @entity21 , so it 's not exactly clear how many expatriates are employed there			1
the @entity9 have n't made it clear , either , how many @entity21 are working in their country			1
@entity63 , director of the @entity64 for @entity65 at @entity66 , said long - term residence there is still no more than a niche option for the vast majority of @entity21 , but the total number of @entity21 is rising , as is their status			1
@entity63 said there used to be a very small @entity74 expat community in @entity75 and @entity8 , but those communities have grown substantially , and smaller communities have emerged in other @entity9 coastal and inland cities			1
it 's not just @entity9 that has captured the attention of @entity21			1
@entity82 , editor - in - chief of @entity83 , a clearinghouse for international job advice and opportunities , has seen a significant spike in inquiries from @entity21 interested in expat employment since the economy began to tank in 2007			1
" the year 2010 represented the high - water mark thus far in terms of such inquiries , " said @entity82			2
" we are receiving many more submissions and inquiries currently from individuals who are or who have been confronting the consequences of the weak economy			2
" @entity82 said @entity102 is the most popular destination for work abroad in terms of searches , with @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , the @entity110 and @entity111 topping the list			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity114 said applications are trending up for her organization as well			1
" in 2010 , the agency received nearly 13,500 applications for volunteer positions around the world , " said @entity117			2
teaching jobs are spiking , too , according to @entity123 with the @entity124			0
he said there are more people participating in teach abroad programs than pre- 2008			0
work life for the @entity130 in @entity9 for the @entity53 , assimilating into the culture has not always been easy			1
but they are glad they 've accepted the challenge and they 've made new friends and professional contacts along the way			0
" when i moved to @entity8 , there were a number of people who did n't know why i had come here and it was hard to break down the walls with some of my colleagues , " said @entity1			0
" once my new team realized i was here to help and that i could use my network and knowledge from the @entity21 to bolster the @entity16 - based team , things improved dramatically			1
" the language barrier has been challenging to navigate , too , she said			0
" if the person you are interacting with has good @entity154 , then you can develop some sort of relationship or bond with them , " @entity11 said			0
" but if we have to resort to our functional @entity9 , we 're interacting at a very primitive level focused on accomplishing the task at hand			1
" at work , the @entity53 are surrounded by people who speak @entity154 , but will rely on interpreters from time to time			2
" in my workplace , nearly everyone is @entity9 and is a graduate of a @entity9 engineering school , " @entity11 said			1
" they all learn @entity154 starting in elementary school			0
" everyone 's situation is different , but the @entity53 said the overall work conditions for them are similar to what they experienced in @entity21 , because they work for @entity21 - based tech companies			1
" my building is clean and secure in a very large office complex with about 500 other major high - tech companies , " @entity11 said			0
although @entity9 is communist , the @entity53 said it almost seems " more capitalist than the @entity21 at times , " because state - controlled industries are being privatized			1
" the @entity9 seem generally more hungry for achievement than the @entity21 -- it is a nation of entrepreneurs , " @entity11 said			1
" we do worry about who is reading our e-mail or listening to our phone calls , but it is more fleeting than some cold - war thriller movie , " @entity11 said			0
@entity1 said work - life balance for them in @entity9 is different than in the @entity21			1
" you rarely see people working through lunch , on holidays or on the weekends -- things that were common to us at home , " she said			0
money matters overseas work and lifestyle experiences greatly differ from person to person and city to city			2
in @entity9 , @entity8 , @entity75 and @entity210 are expensive places to live , with prices for top - range apartments reaching $ 10,000 ( @entity21 ) monthly rent or more , according to a variety of published reports			1
@entity21 can live relatively cheaply ( u.s. $ 1,000 a month ) if they stick to the living standards of the lower - and middle - class ends of the local population			1
outside @entity9 's big cities , prices for everything drop , often by more than half			2
the @entity130 said they are paid roughly the same as they would make in the @entity21 and live in an above - average 1,500 square foot apartment in @entity8 's @entity226 , which is partially supplemented by their employers			2
( their 22 - year - old son watches over their 2,400 square foot suburban home back in @entity4			0
) the couple has a part - time house cleaner who comes to their @entity9 apartment twice a week for 2 - 3 hours a time and she is paid $ 75 ( @entity21 ) a month , which they consider a nice luxury			1
they do n't own a car ( they drove everywhere in @entity4 ) and take the subway to work or use an electric scooter , which is typical for living in @entity8			2
as residents of @entity9 , the @entity53 pay @entity9 and @entity21 taxes and " pay a little more in taxes than we paid in the @entity21 " " aside from housing , living in @entity9 is a lot cheaper for us than the @entity21 , " @entity11 said			1
so how do you find a job overseas ? some companies move their employees overseas for work , like the @entity53			2
websites such as @entity83 and go abroad offer travel guides and employment listings for people looking to do it on their own			2
@entity82 offered five tips on making the move overseas : 1 ) be open - minded when pursuing work abroad			2
" as a result of the current global economic situation , it often helps to broaden geographic and career pursuit possibilities based on factors including , but not limited to , commercial areas of growth , potential earnings , and the related standard of living , " said @entity82			0
2 ) research your destination in every possible way			0
@entity82 said , " research as much as possible the economic drivers and conditions of the destination country , and then pursue work in either growth areas , or in areas where you can directly apply your developed expertise			0
" 3 ) students and new grads : consider resum√© - building experiences			0
examples of such positions include , but are not limited to , internships , au - pair work , leading travel tours , working at youth hostels or on cruise ships			0
these types of jobs , while they do not pay much , allow for interesting and often life - changing travel along with networking opportunities for future professions , said @entity82			0
4 ) assess what you bring to the table			0
given the fact that many countries across the globe are under economic pressure , in many instances there are fewer opportunities for those who come from other countries seeking work opportunities			0
therefore , it is important to determine how one 's skill set would give them a competitive advantage , @entity82 said			0
@entity82 said the internet continues to provide more " location - neutral " work opportunities for those with an entrepreneurial spirit			0
" blogging or building a website to support their travels remotely in relatively inexpensive countries is becoming a viable option for those willing to learn new technologies while networking , " he said .			0
