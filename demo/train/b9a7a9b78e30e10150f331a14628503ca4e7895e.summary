-- at the beginning of 2008 , everything seemed set for @entity4			2
his wife , @entity5 , had the money and the endorsements to run for the presidency			0
she also had the experience and the talismanic @entity11 last name			0
everything was in place for @entity4 's return to the @entity15 , this time as first gentleman			2
then came @entity17 , when the supposedly unstoppable @entity5 for president locomotive was derailed by @entity19 , a first - term senator from @entity20			2
@entity4 could n't believe that this @entity21 - come - lately might block his wife 's path to the @entity15			2
@entity4 and @entity19 may be making common cause now , but four years ago the future president drove the former president crazy			1
@entity19 's sins in the eyes of @entity4 in 2008 were numerous and grievous : he denied @entity5 a shot at the @entity30 that @entity4 believed she earned and he attacked @entity31 by playing the race card , or so @entity4 believed			1
in reality , @entity4 played the race card on himself when he compared @entity19 's victory in the @entity37 primary to @entity39 's wins there in 1984 and 1988			1
perhaps @entity4 's intent was to isolate @entity19 as the " black candidate " ; perhaps not , but an uproar ensued , deeply wounding the man who had been beloved by @entity46 voters throughout his political career			1
@entity19 had even gone so far as to compare @entity4 unfavorably to @entity48 , saying that @entity48 had " changed the trajectory " of the nation " in a way that @entity4 did not			1
" the nerve of this whippersnapper , ranking the first @entity11 president since @entity55 to serve two full terms below the hero of the opposition party -- the party that had tried to throw that @entity11 president out of office			0
by drawing that contrast , @entity19 was consciously baiting @entity31 , secure in the knowledge that as @entity5 's campaign brain trust , his outbursts -- about @entity48 , about the " fairy tale " of @entity19 's pure opposition to the @entity67 , about the " race card " -- were doing harm to his wife 's campaign			2
but @entity19 's biggest offense was simply that he was seeking to replace @entity4 as first in the hearts of the @entity11 faithful			1
and he was doing it courtesy of a free ride from the media -- nothing like the trial by fire that @entity4 had undergone in 1992			2
once the nomination fight ended , @entity5 was quick to dismiss her ill feelings toward @entity19			2
but insiders say @entity4 nursed his grudge , only slowly releasing it as his wife took office as @entity19 's secretary of state			1
the coldness between the 42nd and 44th presidents persisted well into @entity19 's first term			0
@entity19 sought to set the nation 's course on his own , without interference from the man who he said had not achieved the kind of transformative presidency to which he aspired			0
within the @entity11 , the two men were still rivals			0
it 's no accident that @entity4 has had a much warmer relationship with both presidents @entity103 than he has had with @entity19 ; he and the @entity105 are not seeking approval from the same audience			1
now , however , mutual interest has pushed @entity4 and @entity19 together			1
while no one would confuse them for best friends , @entity19 needs @entity4 's access to deep @entity11 pockets and his appeal to white blue - collar voters , who are more attuned to @entity4 's messy i - feel - your - pain empathy than to the professorial coolness of @entity19			1
for his part , @entity4 craves political relevance			1
in the 11 - plus years of his post-presidency , he has succeeded in securing both public acclaim , for his work on @entity123 , and private enrichment , pulling down well into six figures for a single speech			0
but talking to 10,000 people at a gathering of furniture - industry representatives , no matter how high the remuneration , ca n't compare to influencing a presidential election -- or , for that matter , to pressing the flesh in a high - school gymnasium packed with adoring fans			0
what 's more , if @entity5 does follow the advice @entity4 is certain to whisper in her ear and run for the presidency in 2016 , when she will be 69 , the party chits he is now amassing will certainly come in handy			0
@entity4 's political advice to @entity19 to focus less on likely @entity145 presidential nominee @entity144 's inconsistency and more on his devotion to " severe " conservatism comes directly from the @entity4 playbook of 1995 - 96			1
after the drubbing he took in the 1994 midterms , @entity4 revived his fortunes by depicting his @entity145 opponents in @entity153 , led by speaker @entity154 , as a band of radical ideologues seeking to knock down the underpinnings of middle - class @entity46 life , and himself as the only thing stopping them			0
when the government shut down in late 1995 , the public blamed @entity164			0
seeking the president 's re-election , the @entity4 campaign hung the unpopular speaker around the neck of the @entity145 nominee , @entity170 , and that was that			1
@entity19 has the opportunity to position himself as the reasonable centrist seeking to save the nation from the depredations it would suffer were a radical opposition to gain unchecked power			0
he has plenty of material to work with -- the @entity145 in power today make the ones @entity4 faced seem like @entity182 socialists			0
whatever his feelings toward @entity4 , @entity19 should listen to him			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

president @entity19 has *actively* *embraced* @entity4 for help on raising money and gaining voters
@entity188 : @entity19 needs @entity4 in his campaign , @entity4 craves political relevance
he says four years ago , @entity19 drove the former president crazy
@entity188 : whatever his feelings toward @entity4 , @entity19 should listen to him
