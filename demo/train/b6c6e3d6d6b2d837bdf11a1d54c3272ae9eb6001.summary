president @entity0 took an evening away from politicking sunday to honor top artists -- and crack some jokes			1
@entity0 received the five @entity5 honorees at the @entity6 before the annual gala that honored this year @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and ballerina @entity12			1
@entity9 got a presidential mention not just for his chart - topping music career , but also for his stage name			2
" now , not everybody can pull off a name like @entity9 , but this guy can			2
his wife , @entity19 , calls him @entity9			0
apparently his kids call him @entity9 , " @entity0 said to laughs at the @entity6 reception			1
" ' @entity22 ' is a pretty good nickname -- but let 's face it , it 's not as cool as @entity9			1
i kind of wish i was called @entity9			0
" but , @entity0 conceded , " i 'm stuck with ' @entity22 , ' " which stands for @entity22			0
@entity9 , however , later said on the red carpet he was " not so sure " his name is cooler than the president 's moniker			2
@entity33 show host @entity32 , who emceed the @entity5 event , made sure he spotlighted the high profile guests at last night 's events , especially whom he called the " most powerful and influential person in the world " : first lady @entity40			1
" madam first lady , lovely to see you , good evening			0
there she is , looking radiant , next to the president , which i assume means she has no future plans to run for office , " @entity32 quipped			1
" there are a lot of @entity50 who do n't have that courage			0
" @entity50 candidates locked in tight races in the 2014 midterms largely distanced themselves from @entity0 , and he stayed away from the campaign trail in the tightest @entity58 races			0
@entity32 also noted the nonpartisan nature of the soir√©e , which he credited to @entity8			0
" tonight , @entity61 puts the arts above politics , because no matter what party you belong to , everyone wants a selfie with @entity8 , " @entity32 joked			1
earlier in the evening @entity0 also honored @entity8 and his cult roles in movies like " @entity70 " -- which @entity0 said he watched saturday night -- " @entity71 " and " @entity72 , " in which @entity8 ' character gives another @entity75 president , @entity74 , a look at his wounded behind in the movie			2
" i 'm glad he got that last one out of his system before this evening , " @entity0 said			0
the entire @entity5 reception will air on @entity81 on dec. 30			0
but before then , @entity32 's interview with @entity0 will air monday night on " @entity83			1

@entity0 's nickname - of - *choice* ? apparently , it 's " @entity9 "
president @entity0 may have dished out jokes sunday , but @entity40 is apparently " the most powerful and influential "
" there she is *...* next to the president , which i assume means she has no future plans to run for office " @entity32 joked
