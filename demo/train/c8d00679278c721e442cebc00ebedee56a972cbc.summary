@entity0 , @entity1 -- for years , @entity3 struggled to make ends meet			1
she worked 30 hours a week at @entity5 , but her paycheck -- along with child support and disability payments -- never seemed to cover living expenses for her and her five kids			2
despite her best efforts , she kept falling further behind			2
" paying the rent , electric and gas -- it takes everything i have , " she said			2
" i do n't like digging up change ... so i can buy the kids ' food			2
i needed help somehow , somewhere			2
" desperate , @entity3 decided to write a letter to @entity23 , whose newspaper column might be considered a " @entity26 " for the down and out			1
within a few weeks , @entity23 showed up on her doorstep			1
they talked for a while , and then he offered to pay one month 's rent as well as her outstanding gas and electric bills			2
he also went to the local grocery store and stocked the family 's empty refrigerator			1
" i was shocked , " @entity3 said			2
the kids are getting tired of macaroni cheese and @entity39 soup every night			2
" it was just another day 's work for @entity41 , a 60 - year - old real estate broker whose weekly column in the @entity44 focuses on people in dire straits			1
through his column and his nonprofit , @entity47 to help , @entity41 has provided about 500 people a year with food , rent , utilities and other necessities			1
" i 'm just addicted to helping , " he said			1
" i do n't have time to go to the show or golf			2
... my fondness in life is helping my fellow @entity62			1
" @entity41 gets about 20 to 30 letters a week from people in the @entity0 area , and he investigates nearly all of them himself			1
he 'll often visit people 's homes to verify their circumstances			1
if someone appears to have a drug or alcohol problem , he refers them to other programs			2
and to make sure people are being honest about their situation , he 'll open their cupboards to see how much food is in the house			1
" i do not want to give a hard - earned dollar to someone who is taking advantage , " he said			2
" but once i verify that their need is genuine , my heart opens right up			0
" at that point , @entity41 springs into action with his unique safety net			0
he 'll start by meeting immediate needs , perhaps providing a hot meal or moving someone without heat into a warm motel room			0
within a day or two , he 'll take care of other basics , like paying overdue rent or turning on utilities			0
his rapid response is a point of personal pride			0
" there 's not any bureaucratic red tape , " he said			0
" i want to help people now			1
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity109 but @entity41 does n't stop there			1
he also goes over each recipient 's budget and finds ways to stabilize their long - term situation -- maybe negotiating lower rent with their landlords , repairing their car or tapping his network of supporters to help find them a job			0
" it 's not just a @entity125 to feed them for that day , " @entity23 said			1
" we get them back on a track ( so ) that ... their pride is given back to them			1
" it 's a level of personalized assistance that 's almost hard to believe , but there are countless stories of @entity41 's good works throughout @entity1 and @entity138			0
the vast majority of people he helps are never even mentioned in his column			1
for nearly a year , @entity143 and @entity144 had been unemployed , using their savings to pay for a small motel room			0
with almost no money left , @entity143 pawned her jewelry , including her wedding ring			0
@entity23 showed up and helped the couple with gas cards and rent			1
and when he heard about @entity143 's sacrifice , he dipped into his own pocket and made arrangements to get the ring back			1
" those that are in dire need , they 'll sell all their personal belongings to survive , " he said			0
" i want to give them their self - esteem back			1
... they need to hang onto parts of their life , and sentimental things are very important			0
" such stories have become commonplace during the hard economic times of the past few years , and @entity41 has been flooded with requests for help , even as his real estate business has taken a huge hit			1
he still gives away at least 20 % of his income -- he estimates that he has given away a few million dollars of his own money over the years -- but in the last decade he has begun to rely more on donations to his nonprofit , which he started in 1989			1
he has also built a strong network of supporters to help him , along with his wife and four children			0
" the movement has grown , " he said			0
" as fellow @entity62 , we 're all together , helping each other			1
that 's what it 's all about			0
" @entity41 is passionate about helping others because he knows what it 's like to be poor			1
born on the @entity197 of @entity198 to a beautician and a tool - and - die maker , he said his family struggled because of his father 's gambling habit			0
" we moved like gypsies , being evicted a lot , " he said			0
" i know how it feels to watch your mother cry when the electricity is turned off and you have no food			0
" when @entity23 was 12 , he got a job as a dishwasher so he could help out at home			1
@entity217 , he promised @entity218 that if he ever became successful , he 'd always help others in need			0
he has spent nearly all of his adult life making good on that vow			0
after he first found success as a rock concert promoter in the 1970s , @entity41 began to give money to various charities			0
but when he realized that much of their money was spent on overhead , he decided he could do a better job himself and started helping people on his own around the @entity198 area			1
he eventually started his nonprofit , vowing that every penny would go to help others			0
@entity41 's philanthropy has gone through various phases			0
in the 1990s , he took an entire community in @entity138 under his wing			0
but for the last decade or so , he has concentrated most of his work in the @entity1 area where he now lives			0
eight years ago , he was approached by a neighbor who knew about his work and asked him to write a column in the local paper			1
he agreed do it anonymously , adopting a pen name , @entity248 , to stand for with @entity249			0
in recent years , he was persuaded to reveal his identity so that people would be encouraged to donate to his foundation			1
his column has become so popular that it now appears in a number of area papers			2
@entity23 says that when he sees a pile of new letters , he gets anxious thinking about all of the people who need his help			1
he 'll often work late into the night doing " marathons of helping " that leave him physically and emotionally exhausted			2
but every morning , he ca n't wait to start again			0
" when people are in need , they often feel alone , " he said			2
" i want them to know someone cares about them			0
i want to ( say ) : ' come on , i have a little extra strength i want to share with you			0
let 's get you back on your feet			1
' " want to get involved ? check out @entity47 to help website at @entity276 .			0

for years , @entity23 has been personally helping people get back on their feet
many of those people have written to him through his local newspaper column
@entity23 grew up in *poverty* and vowed he would do his best to help others in need
