@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the @entity1 house where she grew up , @entity6 's hazel eyes transfixed on television images of @entity8			1
he was now a fallen leader , a fugitive sought for justice			2
he had been known as the ruthless leader of a pariah state , a butcher , a delusional man divorced from reality			0
but @entity6 , 25 , who served as one of @entity8 's five @entity1 nurses for nearly two years , had always seen him in a different light			1
she had checked his blood pressure , monitored his heart , stuck him with a needle to draw blood , gave him vitamins and pills for his ailments , though he did n't seem to have many			2
he was a healthy man			0
she even called him " daddy			0
" all the @entity1 nurses did			2
it was a nickname they used to speak about him among themselves , without attracting attention			0
" @entity32 gave us jobs , money and a good life , " she said			1
far removed now from the sands of @entity38 , @entity6 sat at the kitchen table with her @entity41 husband , looking upward at the boxy tv set atop the refrigerator			1
images of @entity8 's fiery defiance flashed in the face of ouster			1
she would feel sorry for him if he were killed or captured , she said			0
" @entity8 was quite considerate to us , " she said			1
" he would ask us whether we are happy and whether we have everything that we need			0
" every september , on the anniversary of his rise to power , @entity8 presented souvenirs to his @entity1 nurses and other members of his inner circle			1
@entity6 received a medallion and a watch etched with his picture			1
she took turns with the other nurses accompanying him on foreign trips , sometimes sparking rumors spread in the media about @entity8 's harem			1
all of what was being said about @entity8 seemed contrary to what she knew about the man -- including the allegations by @entity8 family nannies and domestic staff that they were tortured and abused			1
@entity8 , she said , always treated her very well			1
her job now lost to @entity38 's civil war , she pitied the nation			0
" if it were not for @entity8 , who else would have built it ? " she said			1
" it was he who constructed it			0
he has transferred @entity38 from camelbacks into cars			0
" the rules were strict : no lipstick by the time @entity8 visited @entity1 in october 2009 , @entity6 had graduated from nursing school in @entity86 and been working in the area of her native @entity0 for three years			1
but life was not easy in @entity1 ; she was making only $ 125 a month			2
she knew of opportunities in @entity38 and had already submitted an application for work there			0
it was an opportunity to make a better life for herself			2
salaries were higher in @entity38 and she would receive housing and other perks			0
she had been waiting for about a month to hear back when @entity8 arrived on his state visit to @entity1			1
a meeting was arranged for him to meet six personal nurse candidates			1
@entity6 was one of them			1
she knew little about @entity8 then and felt nervous at their first meeting			1
three of the six nurses had already worked in @entity38 and knew @entity107			1
@entity6 thought she did not have a chance			1
@entity8 greeted them but @entity6 found nothing special in the selection process			1
" i do n't know how he made the choice ; perhaps he was a good psychologist , " she said			2
she learned later that he understood people from that first handshake , from that first gaze into their eyes			0
soon , she was on her way to @entity118			0
her job was solely to treat @entity8 and his large family			2
the attractive @entity1 nurses wore no flashy makeup or revealing clothes			2
" our appearance was very humble so as to not attract anybody 's attention , " she said			0
" we would never put on lipstick going to his house and have vivid colors in our clothes			0
" she was always surrounded by others -- @entity8 's wife , children , grandchildren , officials within his inner circle			2
" none of us had ever been one on one with him , " she said			0
" there was n't even a single room in his household where we could have possibly been left alone with him			0
" that 's why she was shocked by the gossip that @entity8 had sexual relationships with his foreign nurses			1
veteran @entity1 nurse , @entity150 , 38 , who had worked with @entity8 for nearly a decade , was described in a @entity153 diplomatic cable posted by @entity154 as a " voluptuous blonde " who " knows his routine			1
" it said the @entity38 dictator was deeply attached to her			0
" @entity150 was the same kind of nurse as we all were , " @entity6 said			1
" she is of course a glamorous and very kind woman with a big heart			2
she helped me a lot			0
" i do n't know who created this image about us nurses , as well as about his female bodyguards , " she said			2
" how could anyone in sane mind assume that we could have had any intimate relationship with @entity8 ? " hoping to return to @entity38 both @entity6 and @entity150 left @entity38 in february when the uprising against @entity8 took root			1
but it was not just the threat of war that prompted @entity6 to leave			2
she was pregnant then and had started showing			0
she returned to her native @entity0 , a village south of @entity86			0
her husband @entity182 , a 38 - year - old @entity41 businessman , joined her there			0
a month ago , as @entity8 's regime teetered , @entity6 gave birth to a baby boy			1
journalists were also eager to hear @entity150 's tales of @entity8 , lining up at her apartment door			2
but she has avoided publicity			0
" all that gossip about her is untrue , " @entity6 said			1
" she was totally fed up			0
there was too much attention on her for no reason			0
" the nurses , she said , had no personal relationship with @entity8			1
" i can only say good things about him , " she said , thinking of the comfortable life she had in @entity38 , dreaming of how to make it happen again			2
" i very much hope that we will return to @entity38 , " she said , flipping through an album with photographs of herself in @entity38			0
only , it will be a different @entity38 now			0
" @entity2 's @entity204 reported from @entity205 , @entity1 , and @entity206 reported from @entity207 .			0

@entity6 worked as a personal nurse to @entity8
she says he treated her well ; was kind and considerate
talk of a sexual relationship between @entity8 and his foreign nurses is untrue , she says
@entity8 gave her a good life , one she dreams about having again
