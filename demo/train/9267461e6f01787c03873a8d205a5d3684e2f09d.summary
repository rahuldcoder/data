-- while @entity3 was battling to keep her @entity5 title defense alive on saturday , the scene of last year 's triumph was being recreated in her native @entity6			1
such has been the impact of @entity9 's first grand slam singles champion in her homeland that tennis chiefs are seeking to bring a bit of @entity14 to @entity15			1
a clay court and two giant screens have been set up in one of the city 's major shopping malls for an interactive experience that will last until the tournament ends on june 10			0
" i 'm very pleased that a country like @entity6 follows our prestigious tournament , " @entity24 president @entity23 said in a statement			0
" for us , it 's an extraordinary opportunity to promote clay - court tennis			0
i 'd like to heartily thank the @entity31 for welcoming us on their home soil for this fabulous event			0
" courting a country with a population of 1.3 billion makes sense for any sport serious about global growth , and the exhibition has been backed by major sponsors such as @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			0
@entity3 has become a marketer 's dream in the past 12 months , securing lucrative endorsement deals which have made her the second highest - paid athlete in the world behind fellow tennis star @entity50			1
her hopes of being around for next weekend 's women 's final remained alive after she came from behind to beat young @entity54 @entity53 on saturday			0
the 30 - year - old rebounded from a first - set debacle in which she made 24 unforced errors to triumph 3 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 1 and earn a last - 16 clash with @entity61 qualifier @entity59			1
the world @entity62 had a surprisingly tough match against an opponent 10 years her junior and 29 places lower in the rankings , one who lost in the first round in @entity70 last year and in 2010			2
" @entity73 is best of three sets , so even if i lose the first set , i still have a chance , " said @entity3 , who is the only @entity6 player left in the tournament after @entity72 lost to @entity50 on saturday			2
" in the first set i was just following what she was doing			0
i felt like she was the champion on the court			0
but i changed a little bit at the beginning of the second set to play my way , and i 'm happy i was able to do that today			0
" @entity3 beat @entity86 in last year 's final , but the @entity88 champion will not feature in the second week of this tournament after suffering a 3 - 6 6 - 3 8 - 6 defeat by @entity92 - born @entity54 @entity91			2
the 63rd - ranked @entity91 's reward for beating the @entity94 is a daunting clash with fourth - seeded @entity97 @entity96 , who battled to a 6 - 2 4 - 6 6 - 1 win against @entity100 's world no. 109 @entity101			1
second - ranked @entity50 cruised into the fourth round as she crushed 28th seed @entity104 6 - 2 6 - 1 to set up a clash with @entity97 @entity106 , who defeated @entity107			1
the 25 - year - old @entity50 was a semifinalist here last year and in 2007 , but the @entity100 may finally win the only grand slam title to elude her if she can keep up the form that has seen her drop just five games in three matches so far			1
however , fellow former world no. 1 @entity113 must continue her agonizing wait for a first major title			2
the @entity116 , now ranked ninth , saved four match - points before losing 1 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 6 - 3 against @entity120 23rd seed @entity118			0
@entity118 blew 5 - 1 leads in the last two sets , but held her nerve to earn a last - 16 clash with 21 - year - old @entity126 player @entity125			1
last year @entity125 beat former world no. 1 @entity127 before losing in round three , and she has gone one step further after eliminating @entity131 25th seed @entity134 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 2 - 6 6 - 2 in a match that ended as darkness fell .			1

defending champion @entity3 reaches the fourth round of the @entity5
fans in her native @entity6 can watch her *progress* at special exhibition in @entity15
the 30 - year - old has become one of the world 's highest - paid *female* athletes
she is *joined* in the last 16 at @entity14 by world no. 2 @entity50
