calls come in from all over the @entity3 from people threatening to flee their homeland if a candidate they despise wins the @entity7			1
" that 's the amazing thing , when they speak on the phone			1
they feel very , very strong about it , " said @entity12 , a @entity13 - based immigration lawyer			1
" ' this government does n't speak for me ' is the language that we often hear			0
" as a partner at the @entity22 firm , which specializes in immigration to @entity24 , @entity12 says he has received these calls for decades			1
it sometimes makes him " feel like a therapist because they vent for a while , get this cathartic release			0
" but when it comes down to it , @entity3 do n't move to @entity24 unless it 's for a relationship or new job -- essentially , love and money			1
opinion : where @entity38 , and @entity3 , go from here @entity12 says he can remember only three of four cases in more than 30 years that involved someone actually making good on their threat to move to @entity24 to escape an @entity3 president			1
this election cycle , he said , most of the calls " tended to be conservative or @entity47 supporters			0
there were not as many from the other side , so maybe they had kind of a premonition			0
" it 's all part of the election season 's bluster cycle , and while partisan hot air is typical this time of year , this year 's squabbling has been " palpably ugly , " even if most of it is just talk , said @entity62 , director of @entity64 's political psychology program and author of " political paranoia : the @entity67 of @entity68			1
" " that 's always been the case : more extreme talk than actions , " he said			1
" you can entertain any idea you want to , but there 's a difference between having an idea and acting on an idea			1
" " but , " @entity62 added , " throw enough ugly ideas into a pot and something is going to boil over			1
" @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 were rife with threats to leave the country if @entity38 or @entity47 won , but we 've also seen the more serious headlines			0
@entity90 of the evangelical group the @entity91 reportedly said last week , " i think there will be blood " if @entity38 wins			0
in north @entity102 , the president of the @entity96 of @entity99 homeowners ' association , a residential community for the elderly , said he would shut the complex 's gates for fear of " negative repercussions ( that ) may occur because of the results of the election , " the @entity94 reported			2
in august , @entity110 , @entity111 , judge @entity109 warned that the country could descend into civil war if @entity38 was re-elected and , as the county 's emergency management coordinator , he considered whether he 'd have to " call out the militia " if @entity38 ordered @entity118 troops to quell the uprising			1
opinion : @entity38 's critics , repudiated at last more recently , after tuesday 's election results came in , real estate mogul and reality tv star @entity122 called for " revolution ! " and urged his 1.8 million @entity85 followers to " march on @entity128 and stop this travesty			2
" he further called on them to " fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice , " while proclaiming the country was now in " serious and unprecedented trouble ... like never before			0
" @entity122 has since deleted the revolution missive			0
@entity136 noted that @entity122 was at the forefront of the so - called " birther movement , " which falsely claims @entity38 was n't born in the @entity3 , so he was n't surprised to see @entity122 sound off , but " the intensity of that was rather shocking			1
" best @entity142 tweets asked if he thought @entity38 's race played a part in the vitriolic nature of the polemics around the country , @entity136 said it " seems to be an issue that was played upon , but you can certainly have hatred and delegitimization with two white candidates as well			2
" one place where race played a factor is @entity157 , @entity158 , where @entity158 students " exchanged racial epithets and violent , politicized chants " after @entity38 's re-election was announced , according to the student - run @entity163			1

" @entity38 makes history again it appeared to be an isolated incident			0
in @entity110 , @entity190 chairman @entity189 chuckled when asked if judge @entity109 's ominous prediction about @entity38 's re-election had come to fruition			1
" no unrest , " he said			2
" just a lot of disappointed people			0
" the staunchly conservative county voted more than seven to three for @entity47 , he said , so now the focus moves to strengthening the @entity190 and " carrying our message of self - reliance to the rest of the country			2
" " republicans are pretty naturally a law - and - order - type people , " he said			2
" i 'm still satisfied @entity3 has this amazing , peaceful process of selecting government			1
no matter who wins , we still have our rights , our businesses , our schools , and life goes on			0
we 'll get ' em next time			0
" so , there are no tanks rolling through the nations ' metropolises , no disappointed partisans reaching for their rifles			0
as @entity189 said , life goes on , as it does after each election cycle , despite the disappointment of those in the losing candidate 's camp			2

" @entity245 are just a very patriotic group , and it does n't matter what side you 're on			2
" @entity136 said he hopes bipartisanship will take hold on @entity249 , but it wo n't be easy because each party is torn by conflicting ideals : catering to their bases and governing in the best interest of the people			0
" it 's hard to reach across the aisle and get slapped down , but that 's what has to happen			2
there 's a lot of wounds to heal , " @entity62 said			0
