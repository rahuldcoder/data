@entity0 -- four - year - old @entity2 lies in a hospital bed with curiosity gleaming in his eyes as he listens to a family friend tell him the age - old story of @entity8 and the whale			1
the young boy is surprisingly bright - eyed after the traumatic ordeal he 's endured as a result of the latest outbreak of warfare between @entity15 and @entity16			1
he and his parents were staying in an apartment in @entity19 in southern @entity16 when a rocket sailed over from @entity15 and slammed into it , leaving a gaping hole in the building			1
the blast sheered off several of @entity2 's tiny fingers , badly wounded his father , and killed his mother , @entity27 , one of the first to die on the @entity16 side of the border			1
@entity31 leaders in @entity32 for cease - fire talks involving @entity16 @entity2 learned about his mother from his father , @entity35 , who is recovering in the same hospital			1
" he was saying , ' my mother is not here ; she 's with @entity40			2
' he knows it will be a hard time , " his grandmother , @entity42 @entity41 , said			0
@entity45 is putting it mildly			0
doctors at the @entity48 at @entity50 hospital re-attached four of his fingers , but in the end they had to re-amputate two of them			2
" he lives in the @entity54 and there are rockets all the time in that area			0
@entity31 does n't even think about where the rockets are going , " his grandmother said			0
while nurses attended to @entity2 in @entity64 , one room away nurses were attending to on another child with nearly identical wounds from the most recent chapter of this conflict			1
what sets them apart is that the second child is from @entity15			1
eight - year - old @entity72 lost three fingers when the war came to her home			2
" i heard the sound of a missile that hit			0
i did n't even have time to ask what happened and then the second one ( hit ) , " said her mother , @entity80			2
when the dust cleared , she could see the bones of her @entity87 fingers in small pieces on the floor			0
the girl was taken to @entity15 's @entity91 , but it was too crowded and could n't give her the best care			1
so the family asked @entity16 for permission to cross the border			1
initially , her mother was terrified at the prospect of people considered an enemy in her country handling her wounded daughter			2
" itÂ¹s a strange situation and it 's my first time entering @entity16			1
i was afraid , but they treat me and my daughter in a very nice way , and i understand that medicine has nothing to do with politics , " @entity104 said			1
that 's the philosophy the hospital tries to adhere to -- no matter what			2
after @entity16 - @entity15 : who won , who lost ? " all the tension is blocked outside of the hospital here			1
there is an island of sanity in the stormy water of the @entity122			0
here we actually treat people			0
we do n't actually look from where they are , what they do and what they did before coming here , and what they are going to do after leaving us , " said @entity125 , ceo of @entity48			0
the same doctor is treating the two children of conflict who both lost fingers from rocket blasts			2
" it will affect her life from now on , and his life from now on , in choice of profession ... or in choice of future partners for life , everything			0
and this kind of injury , although it seems minor , it 's affecting the person for life , " hand surgeon dr. @entity149 said			0
@entity149 has worked in this @entity0 hospital nearly her entire career			2
she has treated everyone from soldiers to suicide bombers and the civilians in between			0
" i come to think about what is it about this piece of land that everybody is fighting about it all the time			0
this is what comes to my mind : whether this is our lot for eternity from now on			0
always have injuries on both sides , always fighting -- what 's the point ? " she asks			0
if there is a point , it is lost on a 4 - year - old boy and an 8 - year - old girl from either side of the @entity16 - @entity15 border who just want to be children , but whose innocence has been interrupted by a war they had nothing to do with			1
amid cease - fire , anxiety rules in @entity16 , @entity15			1

@entity2 , 4 , and @entity196 , 8 , were both injured in @entity16 - @entity15 conflict
@entity2 is from @entity16 ; @entity196 is from @entity15
both are being cared for in same @entity16 hospital
" medicine has nothing to do with politics , " one mother says
