-- before humans ever went into space , there were books about the possibility			1
some were fantasies about life in the cosmos			0
eventually , after the @entity13 began , some profiled the men and women who brought space exploration to life			2
with the shuttle @entity19 concluding @entity21 's 30 - year space shuttle program , it seems only fitting that we sample a few books about space exploration			1
the @entity21 began its program with the seven @entity27 astronauts , so here are seven books -- six works of nonfiction and one of fiction -- about aiming for the stars			1
top 5 space movies " @entity36 " by @entity37 @entity37 's history of the early space program , which originated as a four - part series in @entity41 , was a 1979 best - seller			1
the book blends the stories of test pilots such as @entity46 -- fearless , free - spirited fliers who blazed the trail for the future @entity27 astronauts ( all of whom were pilots themselves )			0
" it is @entity37 at his very best , better in fact than he 's been before			0
it is technically accurate , learned , cheeky , risky , touching , tough , compassionate , nostalgic , worshipful , jingoistic -- it is superb , " wrote @entity55 in the @entity56			0
indeed , it may be @entity37 's best book			0
" @entity60 : @entity61 " by @entity62 and @entity63 there are a number of fine books on the @entity60 , including " @entity67 , " by astronauts @entity68 and @entity70 , and @entity72 's " @entity71			1
" but @entity62 and @entity63 's thorough 1989 history of the program that led to the moon landing remains a standout , with finely etched portraits of @entity79 's behind - the - scenes personnel and the drama of overcoming scientific and political obstacles			1
space station crew takes final spacewalk of shuttle era " packing for @entity85 " by @entity86 so you think being an astronaut is easy ? as @entity86 demonstrates in her amusing and informative book , which came out last year , it 's anything but			1
humans were n't designed for space , with its lack of gravity and endless opportunities for boredom , and @entity86 ( " @entity104 , " " @entity105 " ) revels in tales of bodily fluids gone awry , the use of cadavers , and what it 's like being trapped on a long mission , in a small capsule , with people you may not really like			2
something to think about before booking that trip on @entity109			0
minute by minute : atlantis shuttle lifts off for final time " @entity112 " by @entity113 the second man to land on the moon is more than just an astronaut			1
@entity113 has a doctorate in aeronautics and put his name on an @entity121 app. but he 's also had his share of struggles			1
in this memoir , he talks about his life as an astronaut -- but also life afterwards , when he coped with alcoholism and depression			2
he also has some pointed words about the space program 's future			1
" @entity133 " by @entity134 the space shuttle has been praised as " a fantastic vehicle " by a @entity79 employee , but the people who have been at the controls did n't always think so			0
@entity134 , a former pilot who flew three shuttle missions , is brash , profane and blunt in talking about @entity79 's culture -- and often tender when telling stories about his fellow astronauts			2
@entity19 mission extended " @entity145 " by @entity146 for all the people who have gone into space -- about 500 -- just 12 have stepped on the moon and returned to tell the tale			1
@entity146 , a @entity151 journalist , went in search of the surviving moonwalkers and found a set of men who were , by turns , driven , spiritual , reserved and thoughtful			2
he even got in a few questions with the notoriously private @entity158			0
" @entity161 " series by @entity160 ok , so the @entity162 has n't been destroyed to make way for an hyperspace bypass , and @entity165 was n't created by an interstellar architect			0
nevertheless , @entity160 ' points remain timeless : the human race is just a giant science experiment , always bring a towel , and -- above all -- do n't panic			0
good advice whether you 're exploring the galaxy -- or @entity174			0
@entity79 flight director relishes the moment , focuses on the mission			0
