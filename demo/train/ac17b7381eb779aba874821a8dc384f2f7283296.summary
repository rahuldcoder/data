hopes that a peace process might take hold in @entity3 this year were quickly dashed by the resumption of heavy fighting last week around @entity3 's @entity7 airport			1
now , as the tenuous ceasefire observed over the holidays falls apart , the question is whether this latest violation of the @entity13 ceasefire agreement is the beginning of a separatist offensive to claim more territory			2
it certainly looks that way			2
on january 13 , the leaders of @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , one of the two breakaway @entity24 enclaves in @entity3 's @entity26 region , issued @entity3 troops an ultimatum to surrender @entity7 airport			1
since then , the long standing derelict control tower , subject to months of shelling , has finally collapsed and with it any likelihood that this conflict will stay frozen over the winter			2
the assault triggered a @entity3 counterattack , and erupted into a full scale conflagration			1
@entity3 's defense ministry has said it has withdrawn from the main terminal at @entity41 , but it is doubtful that separatist forces only have that in their sights anyway			1
after all , although the site holds symbolic value for both sides , it is a hulking ruin and of little strategic relevance			0
and the leader of @entity21 , @entity51 , has made clear he believes the borders of his breakaway republic should include the entire @entity7 region , which is double the current territory he controls			1
such ambitions are not likely to be realized during the freezing cold of january , but separatist forces are now engaged in combat north of @entity60 and as far south as @entity61			0
it is difficult to see @entity64 's army sitting out on the sidelines as all this unfolds , leaving the stage set for another battle between @entity3 and @entity64 regular forces as @entity3 's leadership and army are put to the test again			1
true , the separatist force barely numbers 25,000 - 30,000 , and only a fraction of it is combat - capable			0
but the timing of this latest operation is clearly aimed at fostering instability in @entity3 at a moment of economic weakness , rather than taking advantage of any newfound military opportunity			1
@entity3 's cash reserves fell to $ 7.5 billion in december , while the political leadership is desperately awaiting a new tranche of funding from the @entity88 , without which @entity3 may soon go bankrupt			1
meanwhile , @entity3 faces an incredibly difficult year due to gdp contraction , inflation , currency devaluation , and anticipated fiscal austerity measures			1
since much of its army depends on volunteer donations to survive in the field , prolonged fighting will create unbearable strain , on the people and the country			2
and despite @entity64 's economic woes , as well as the impact of @entity104 sanctions , nothing seems to have visibly constrained @entity106 's policies in @entity3			1
in retrospect , it is clear @entity64 had no intention of starting this year with negotiations , rather than military action to change facts on the ground			0
@entity64 leaders are for their part trapped in a dilemma of their own making			0
they are unable to secure @entity64 influence in @entity3 through the current agreement , in a manner that relieves sanctions , and satisfies separatist desires for a viable independent territory			1
@entity3 's president @entity125 , of course also lacks domestic political support for a genuine compromise with @entity106 , having created a coalition government with his political rival			1
however , it is @entity64 that struggles under sanctions and must find a way out of the current situation			0
and unfortunately , the only way out for @entity106 seems to be war			0
for @entity64 , the @entity13 agreement is a dead end			0
the fact is that it should be for the @entity139 as well			1
making @entity64 stick to this agreement , despite its uselessness in achieving any path to settlement in the conflict , is a negotiating position that is unrealistic and has run its course			0
the pressure of sanctions is insufficient to coerce @entity64 away from using force , meaning that instead of a diplomatic victory , the @entity104 is witnessing @entity3 cede more territory to the separatists			2
another defeat will shake its political system as well			0
how should the @entity104 respond ? the @entity139 has no good choices , only hard decisions to make			1
the first priority should be to negotiate a new ceasefire to end the bloodshed			0
if separatist goals are truly limited , it should not take long			0
then , the @entity13 agreement should be scrapped as a basis for settlement			0
that is far from @entity3 's first choice , but it is not in a position to expect best outcomes , especially when its army is in retreat			1
meanwhile , the @entity104 needs to work with @entity64 and @entity3 leaders to come up with new terms			2
the framework will look similar to @entity13 , but sanctions and economic woes have undoubtedly created strategic clarity in @entity106 about the need for this conflict to end this year			0
plus , the latest fighting will change @entity182 's perspective as well			2
if all this proves unsuccessful , then there is nothing to stop @entity104 leaders from providing more weapons to @entity3 , or imposing new hardships on @entity64			2
the latest fighting demonstrates the limits of what those policies might accomplish for @entity3			1
@entity64 has not been brought to heel			0
it is time to try for a new peace settlement .			0

fighting has erupted in past week at @entity3 's @entity7 airport
