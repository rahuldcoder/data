-- @entity2 " @entity1 " @entity1 has apologized for the timing of his complaints about the length of his rivals ' prosthetic limbs after his shock loss in the 200 - meter sprint at the @entity10 in @entity11			1
minutes after losing the race to 20 - year - old @entity14 runner @entity13 on sunday , @entity1 accused the gold medalist and others in the race of wearing " unbelievably long " blades			1
" you ca n't compete on stride length			0
you saw how far ( @entity13 ) came back so , you know what , we 're not racing a fair race here , but i gave my best on a great night , " he said			2
live : catch the @entity29 action as it happens early monday , @entity1 apologized for the timing of his comments but said that he believed " there is an issue here			1
" " i accept that raising these concerns immediately as i stepped off the track was wrong , " @entity1 said in a statement			1
" that was @entity13 's moment and i would like to put on record the respect i have for him			2
" @entity13 passed the @entity2 in the final stretch to take the gold medal in a time of 21.45 seconds			0
it was slower than the world record of 21.30 set by @entity1 in the qualifying heat saturday , but fast enough for a decisive win against the race favorite who clocked a time of 21.52			1
like @entity1 , @entity13 , is a double - amputee who runs with the aid of prosthetic limbs			1
immediately after the race , @entity1 expressed incredulity at @entity13 's dash in the race 's final seconds			1
" i think @entity13 's a great athlete but you ca n't come back ( that much )			2
i run just over 10 metres per second and i do n't know how you can come back -- by watching the replay -- from eight metres behind on the 100 to win			0
it 's absolutely ridiculous , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 also accused bronze medalist @entity64 @entity63 of stretching , if not breaking , the rules			1
" the guy came down literally overnight and made his blades longer			2
his knee height 's like four inches higher than what it should be			2
" the @entity2 said he 'd attempted to raise the issue of blade length with the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) in the weeks before the race but his concerns had " fallen on deaf ears			2
" the @entity74 issued a statement saying that all athletes competing in amputee events had their prostheses measured before the race and all complied with @entity83			2
@entity13 said it was " difficult " to hear allegations of cheating coming from someone he regarded as a " great idol			0
" @entity1 ' grandmother on his fighting spirit asked whether @entity1 was just a bad loser , he said : " ( he is ) not a bad loser			1
@entity1 is a great athlete ... i still do not know with whom he is picking a fight			1
it 's not with me			2
" @entity13 denied he had cheated and attributed his performance to training			0
" it 's not just about the protheses , there is training behind			2
i get upset to hear this kind of thing			0
i 'm inside the rules ( of the @entity106 )			0
i came here to celebrate and do not enter in any polemics , " he said			0
it was a sentiment echoed by @entity63			0
" ( @entity1 ) has his opinion			1
you know , we go by the @entity74 rules			0
i 'm following the rules			0
i feel like i 'm not cheating , i do the best i can			0
i still work hard every day -- i train six days a week , two or three times a day			0
so i feel it 's not the legs			0
for him to say it 's the legs , i disagree			0
but he 's a great runner			0
i truly support him and what he does , honestly			0
" after a short meeting with @entity1 after the race , the @entity74 's director @entity121 said the committee 's science and medical director @entity126 would meet the athlete at a later date in a " non-emotional environment			1
" " the @entity74 respects the significant role @entity1 has played in raising the global profile of @entity132 since his @entity10 debut in 2004			1
therefore we are more than willing to give him an opportunity to air his views , " @entity121 said in a statement			0
opinion : @entity1 , an inspiration and a question @entity1 later appeared to back away from his earlier statements , tweeting an image of him shaking @entity13 's hand and the message : " @entity13 of @entity14 for his 200m win			1
. the fastest last 80m i have ever seen to take it on the line			0
pic ! " just weeks ago , @entity1 made history by becoming the first double - amputee to contest an able - bodied @entity152 when he competed at the @entity153 in @entity11			1
while the runner failed to win a medal , his presence on the track was lauded as an example of victory over adversity and a lesson in dedication to a goal			0
after initially being refused permission to compete against able - bodied competitors , @entity1 hired a legal team to prove that his artificial limbs did n't give him an unfair advantage			1
born with a congenital abnormality , @entity1 had both his legs amputated below the knee at 11 months of age and now runs on specially - adapted carbon - fiber limbs			1
later this week , @entity1 will compete in the men 's @entity174 100 - meters -- set for wednesday and thursday -- and the @entity174 400 - meters -- friday and saturday -- both of which he won at the @entity29 four years ago			1
