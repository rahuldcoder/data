-- @entity1 brought misery to a rainy wednesday in north @entity4 as they defeated @entity5 to knock rivals @entity6 off their perch at the top of the @entity9			1
a lacklustre @entity6 had dropped valuable points at @entity11 and @entity1 took advantage to move two points ahead of the @entity14 with a free - flowing 5 - 1 victory against @entity5			1
but manager @entity16 poured cold water on any talk of @entity1 now being title favorites despite the @entity4 rout			2
" i think it 's too soon to be the favorites -- there 's a lot of matches to play , " he was quoted on the club website			0
" if we continue to play the way we are , we will have chances to win but it 's early			0
" @entity33 @entity32 pounced after 15 minutes to give @entity1 the lead only to hobble off the pitch with a right leg injury just before half time			1
even without @entity32 , who has now scored 50 @entity9 goals , @entity16 's men found their scoring boots in the second half			2
@entity41 stroked home the ball from the penalty spot after @entity45 was shown a red card for a lunge on @entity48 in the penalty area			0
@entity48 got in on the act as he clipped in @entity51 's rebounded shot from close range before substitute @entity54 added to the scoreline with his first league goal			0
city captain @entity57 polished off the victory over 10 - man @entity5 late on			1
@entity60 missed their chance to close the gap on @entity6 and @entity1 as they were held to a 0 - 0 draw by a gutsy @entity65 side			1
even with a whopping 39 attempts on goal , @entity67 's men could not find the back of the net as the relegation threatened @entity65 dug in			2
it looked as if there might be a reprieve for @entity60 as seven minutes of extra time were added on but @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 were all denied			2
@entity80 clasped his hands to his face in disbelief at the final whistle as @entity60 missed their chance to go second in the table and for now stay third , three points off the leaders			1
a frustrated @entity67 commented on @entity88 : " if i was at home watching for sure i would turn off or change to another match			0
" maybe the match the @entity93 manager should have watched was @entity95 's pulsating 4 - 3 victory over @entity96			0
it may not be the game that settles the thrilling title fight but it was arguably the match of the night wednesday			0
in @entity101 , @entity100 were back in business in the @entity103 as they rallied to beat @entity104 2 - 1 and stretch their unbeaten league run to an astonishing 43 matches			1
@entity108 's league leaders had @entity109 and @entity110 to thank for getting back on terms after @entity112 had put the home side ahead			2
@entity100 's record run in the @entity101 league dates back to october 2012 and , as if one record was n't enough , they also notched up their 28th away match in the @entity103 without defeat			1
in @entity120 , intensity was the key for @entity122 as he watched his @entity124 side book a place in the @entity127 semi-final , which are staged over two legs			0
a solo strike from @entity130 was enough to sweep aside holders @entity131 and book a last four meeting against @entity133			0
@entity135 host @entity134 in the other semifinal			0
there was rain in @entity139 as @entity140 braved the weather to complete a 5 - 1 victory over @entity143 at a soggy @entity144 to advance to the @entity146 semifinals			1
goals from @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , who scored twice , and @entity151 sealed a 9 - 2 win on aggregate			0
holders @entity154 set up a hotly anticipated semifinal with city rivals @entity157 after beating @entity158 2 - 1 wednesday .			1

a *lively* @entity1 side thrash @entity5 5 - 1 in the @entity9
@entity1 knock @entity6 off the top of the table and now hold a two - point lead
@entity60 are held to a 0 - 0 draw by a plucky @entity65 side
