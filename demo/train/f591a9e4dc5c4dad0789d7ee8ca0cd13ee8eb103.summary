-- @entity2 - @entity1 does n't mince her words			1
@entity5 politics is too " blokey , " traditional media is " dying , " and the press gallery " is a beast that feeds on itself			1
" " i think it 's got me into a lot of trouble , " the former political journalist says of her straight - talking style			1
" but i think it 's something that 's needed more			0
there 's too much spin in the media			2
i 'm so allergic to spin			0
" for 25 years @entity1 was one of @entity5 's best known political commentators , working for @entity21 newspaper the @entity23 , national magazine @entity22 , and public broadcaster the @entity25 , among many others			1
she saw five prime ministers come and go in half a lifetime " living and breathing " the @entity29 press gallery			1
then @entity31 , @entity5 's first female prime minister , came to power and @entity1 got so hacked off she left and wrote a book about it			1
it was n't @entity31 , as much as her treatment by the media that infuriated @entity1			1
" she was mercilessly and relentlessly lampooned for her hair , clothes , accent , her arse , even the way she walks and talks , " she says in book " @entity39 of @entity31			1
" screen star now the controversial account -- which became one of the country 's top - selling nonfiction books and provoked a backlash from some former colleagues -- is set to hit our screens , with @entity56 - winning actor and fellow @entity5 @entity57 playing @entity31			1
@entity1 is pleased with the decision to cast @entity59 , perhaps best known internationally for her role in @entity62 series " @entity63 , " saying both women possess " the same calm demeanor			2
" producer @entity66 -- the man behind other @entity68 bio-dramas " @entity69 " and " @entity70 " -- will oversee the project , expected to be released in 2015			0
though it 's still undecided if it will take the form of a tv drama or feature film			2
power play @entity31 came to power in 2010 , replacing fellow @entity68 leader @entity78			2
three years later , the party voted @entity78 back in			0
" the book is a fairly ' in - your - face ' account of @entity31 's leadership , " says @entity1			1
" it focuses on how she was undermined by @entity78 's forces and the role the media played in it			2
" why did she feel compelled to write it ? " because i got angry			0
not just because of what was happening to her , but because i had given a quarter of a century of my life to trying to report as accurately and fairly as i could , and i was bloody appalled by the mind - set about her leadership , " says @entity1 , who left the press gallery in 2009			1
" there were very few people in the media who were prepared to divert from the pack and scrutinize in an objective fashion -- which as journalists is what we 've been told to do on a daily basis			0
" did the fact @entity31 was a woman affect how she was portrayed by the media ? " it had something to do with it , " says @entity1 , speaking by phone from her home in @entity29 , not far from the country 's @entity109			1
" i do believe we in @entity5 have a deeply ingrained ... how do i say this ? we 're just not ready for women in positions of power			2
" young ambition @entity1 grew up in @entity21 , one of six children in an @entity123 - @entity122 home , with a father who was involved in the @entity125 throughout the 1960s			1
politics had always been a topic around the dinner table			0
but when @entity68 prime minister @entity131 was dramatically dismissed by the governor - general in 1975 -- the only time in @entity5 's history this had ever happened -- it became a passion			1
" you 'd have to have had your head under a rock not to be interested one way or another , " says @entity1 , who dreamed of being a journalist for as long as she can remember			1
" i went for a cadetship at what was then the @entity144			0
and i was told by this bloke who was blowing cigarette smoke all over me that ' we do n't take convent girls , ' because i had come from a school run by nuns , ' " she said			0
after that , @entity1 says she " just sort of winged my through , " working as a copywriter , then for a trade union paper , before landing her first job at the @entity157 , and becoming a familiar face in the @entity29 press gallery			1
life 's work " @entity109 is a little city in itself , with around 3,000 people working there , " said @entity1			2
" it 's a wild card on any given day -- you never know how politicians are going to be reacting to certain policies or events			0
so you have to be basically on - call 24/7			0
even now i ca n't get out of the habit of staying up until all the current affairs shows are done and making sure you 're fully across everything			0
" today , the mother of a 23 - year - old son , who describes her age as " not yet 60 , " still contributes the odd political commentary , volunteers with aboriginal - support groups , and is " plotting her next book			2
" it 's perhaps fitting that her two dogs are called @entity184 and @entity185 -- after 19th century @entity5 boxer @entity185			2
she laughs when i point out the similarities with her own fighting words			0
" i know the book did hit a lot of nerves , " she says			0
" but i do hope it contributes to discussion about the way politicians and the media are responsible to the public			0
if it 's done that , then well and good			0
i 'll be bloody pleased			0
