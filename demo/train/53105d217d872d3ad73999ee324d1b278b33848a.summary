-- who has n't left a strange airport wondering not just whether you should be in this taxi but whether it even is one -- only to be charmed , amused or unexpectedly edified by the person behind the wheel			2
or , it 's true , bored to death , humiliated or even ripped off			2
now an online booking service called @entity11 has released a survey of 2,162 recent @entity14 vacationers , asking them to name the meanest , nastiest , take - the - longest - route - and - still - expect - a - tip taxi drivers on the planet			1
travel shocker ! @entity14 tourists consider @entity20 cabbies rude and get outta ze cab ! it 's the @entity20			1
but -- and here we perform some fabulously expressive gesticulation whose meaning is " leave my hired vehicle immediately " -- it 's also the @entity30			2
that 's right : the two @entity33 nations have drawn up level at the traffic lights and been judged equally rude			2
but for every offensive action , there 's an equal and opposite reaction -- which brings us to @entity39			2
some of its taxi drivers , those on the island of @entity44 , were judged among the friendliest on the planet			1
the news comes on the heels of findings that people on another @entity39 isle , @entity51 , are among those with the longest life expectancy on @entity54			0
diet has a lot to do with it , but so , too , does a famously laid - back attitude -- something that might have infected the @entity44 cabbies			2
but what about those @entity14 vacationers ? could it be that their collective offense - taking at the cab driving @entity66 and @entity67 of this world comes from the famous reluctance of the @entity20 and @entity30 to speak @entity70 just because the @entity14 do ? rides worldwide to broaden the field a bit , what do non-brits think of cab drivers worldwide ? asking around our well traveled staff produced some passionate responses			1
@entity81 cabbies wear suits , white gloves and put doilies and plastic covers on all upholstery			0
but they 're easily inflamed			0
" do n't touch the door ! " warns one editor			0
" that 's for the driver to operate in your first moment of ultra-impressive service			1
" " @entity98 taxi drivers can be mean and whiny if you 're not going far or stuck in a lucrative traffic jam , " says associate producer ( and local ) @entity96			1
" and , as second - jobbing small businessmen , they all have multiple mobile phones on the dash , so forget about small talk			0
" @entity54 's best taxis top storytellers next to @entity110 's beetle - shaped black cruisers , @entity108 yellow cabs must be the most recognizable in the world			1
you 'd expect @entity108 cabbies to be sassy -- but rude ? " are you rude to them ? " parries @entity114 , an @entity115 resident in her early thirties			1
" i 've found that @entity108 cab drivers are some of the best storytellers -- a simple ' hello ' can get them going			1
" some do n't want to be bothered , but most enjoy sharing their adventures , whether it be about celebrity passengers or their lives in a foreign country you dream of visiting			0
" view from the front @entity114 raises a good point			0
what 's the view from the front seat ? " you know , 99 % of people are as nice as pie , " says @entity134 , general secretary of the @entity14 @entity135 , himself behind the wheel of a @entity110 cab for 30 years			1
( another , global survey , it should be said , has consistently rated @entity110 's legendary black taxis the best in the world			1
) " @entity149 driving restores your faith in humanity			0
it can be trying when people say , ' i 'm staying at the hotel with the green door			0
' do n't you know there are 8,000 hotels in @entity110 ? " and you get obnoxious people who 've been drinking -- but that 's not as common as you might think			1
" the 1 % -- the loonies -- can be right wing , left wing , @entity166 or @entity167			0
drivers always say , put ' em all together in an island in the @entity171 ! " pull up here we 're getting out here			0
in the comments section , share your stories of being charmed , amused or unexpectedly edified by the person by the wheel			0
or bored to death , humiliated or even ripped off .			0
