-- @entity2 's mother is dead			1
the same goes for two of his acquaintances , plus a convenience store worker in his hometown of @entity9 , @entity10 , some 30 miles east of @entity11			1
yet rather than preparing for their funerals , @entity2 is likely planning his defense -- from jail			0
all five of the deceased died violently , found over a busy and bloody six - hour stretch monday night within miles of each other in @entity9			1
as of tuesday afternoon , the 36 - year - old @entity2 faced a single charge of murder , in the death of the @entity24 's market worker , the only victim it is believed the suspect did not know			1
but @entity9 police chief @entity27 made clear that " additional capital murder charges " are anticipated			1
" this is a country community , a rural community , " @entity27 said tuesday			0
" people are really close			2
and this is going to have a really big impact on us			0
" the chaos began around 5 p.m. monday with reports of a gunshot victim			0
police arrived to find a dead woman -- later determined to be @entity41 , @entity9 's 55 - year - old aunt -- with at least one bullet wound to the head			1
about a half hour later , a firefighter noticed that a nearby home was on fire , @entity27 explained			0
these flames were quickly extinguished , and authorities found another woman 's body			1
this was @entity53 's house , and the victim was @entity55 , his 61 - year - old mother			1
investigators determined the two deaths -- like the victims -- appeared related and issued an alert to law enforcement to look for @entity53 and the white 2002 @entity61 he was believed to be driving , @entity27 explained			1
as law enforcement looked , more gunshots were reported elsewhere in @entity9 , with no one injured and the shooter getting away in a white vehicle			1
a report of another shooting came in around 10:30 p.m. , where a man and vehicle matching the bulletin had been spotted			2
police went in the home and found 33 - year - old @entity75 and 30 - year - old @entity76 -- both of whom lived there , both now shot dead			1
@entity27 said later that " all indications are that ( @entity2 ) knew those victims , " adding only that " they hung out occasionally			2
" it was a mere 10 minutes later when an off - duty police officer spotted the @entity61 and , after closer examination , the suspect inside @entity86			1
later , 22 - year - old worker @entity88 was found slain there			2
a high - speed pursuit followed , ending in a dead - end			2
the suspect stopped his car , got out , then fled -- shielded by heavy brush and the dark night sky			2
authorities stopped chasing him about 150 feet in , instead setting up a wide perimeter and calling in a state @entity101 helicopter			0
that helicopter 's crew and officers on the ground ultimately located @entity107 hiding in a creek around 1:30 a.m. tuesday and took him into custody " without incident			2
" only one weapon was involved in the crimes , said @entity27 , who did not describe it			0
hours later , disbelief , disgust and sadness permeated @entity9			1
an emotional @entity118 , the owner of @entity86 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity119 that he and the world had " lost a good , honest , caring individual " in @entity121			0
" i loved him as a person , " @entity118 said of his slain employee			0
" i loved him like a son			0
" and @entity126 , who identified himself as the suspect 's brother , told @entity119 that he was at a " total loss " to explain what happened -- including to their mother , @entity55 , whom @entity126 described as " so quiet and good			1
" " i 'm devastated , " @entity126 told the station			2
" ... i 'm in a daze			0
" @entity53 was in police custody tuesday facing one count of evading arrest in a vehicle in addition to the murder charge			2
his listed address is the home that was burned down			0
it was not known who will represent him in court ; @entity0 's call to the @entity150 public defender 's office on tuesday was not immediately returned			0
a public records search indicated @entity2 previously had been convicted on theft , burglary , weapons , assault of a family member and marijuana possession and other charges , though nothing close to this scale			0
so how do authorities explain this week 's bloodshed ? @entity27 said that authorities have " several theories that we 're working , " though he would n't go further than that			0
and asked about @entity2 's condition at the time of the arrest , the police chief said he did " appear to be intoxicated on some sort of substance , ( but ) at this point we do n't have a real good idea exactly what that is			1
" as horrific as the events were , @entity27 said that it might have even worse had the off - duty officer not spotted the suspect at the @entity9 market			1
" all i can say is , i think that had the police officer not intervened , " @entity27 said , " i was very concerned that we would have additional situations that we would have to had to deal with that night			0
" @entity0 " s @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
