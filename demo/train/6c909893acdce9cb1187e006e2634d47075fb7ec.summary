-- for most couples , a few differences -- whether philosophical , religious , or simply about whose turn it is to do the dishes -- are hardly newsworthy			1
but for vice presidential candidate @entity7 and his wife @entity8 , political dissimilarities were enough to land them an article in the @entity11			1
this may not seem like a big deal to the couple themselves -- she 's a " practical conservative " from a prominent @entity19 family and he 's , well , a staunch @entity18			1
yet such seemingly major differences can be mind - boggling to many people , particularly in the heat of election season			2
of course , the @entity25 are n't the first couple to agree to disagree politically in the name of love			2
political strategists @entity29 and @entity31 famously butted heads on the campaign trail , then stunned @entity34 when they fell in love , got married and raised a family			2
and there have always been rumors that some first ladies have n't agreed with their presidential spouses on every issue ; @entity41 is one example			2
it may surprise those of us who are in agreement with our partners -- or who ca n't imagine dating a @entity18 or @entity19 -- but political differences can actually be a benefit to some relationships			1
" if a couple who does n't share political views has a healthy relationship , then that speaks to other strengths , " says psychotherapist @entity52 , author of " @entity53 : @entity59 in 28 days			2
" " for example , they may have good communication and conflict resolution skills , a healthy sex life , shared goals , and similar interests -- all of which are possible even if their politics differ			0
" but how does that conflict play out in the bedroom ? democrats and @entity18 may be able to agree to disagree , but their differences appear to continue between the sheets			1
according to a recent survey by @entity77 and dating website @entity79 of more than 5,000 single @entity34 men and women , politically liberal respondents were more likely to have sex more often , but conservative respondents reported having " better " sex			1
specifically , 53 % of those who described themselves as conservative @entity18 said that they reached orgasm every time they had sex , compared with 40 % of @entity72			1
" orgasm , particularly among women , takes practice and knowing one 's body , " suggests @entity90 , a postdoctoral fellow at @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity94 and a co-researcher on the study			0
" conservatives tend to be more traditional and rigid			0
so , it reasons that this might also manifest in the bedroom -- once they 've found something that works , they stick to it ! " that 's just a guess , of course			0
but the survey also uncovered some other interesting sexual - political tidbits			1
for example , the @entity72 surveyed placed more importance on sense of humor , independence and equality in a partner , while conservative @entity18 were more likely to seek out someone of the same background and political party and were more apt to want to get married			1
overall , such fun facts make for excellent cocktail party fodder , but they may not have much of an impact on real relationships			2
in fact , the survey found that just 17 % of men and 20 % of women said they must be with someone who 's in their political party			1
" the interesting message from this survey is that , regardless of political affiliation , almost everyone in @entity34 recognizes the importance of love and sex , either in their lives or the world around them , " @entity90 says			1
" this is an important message during an election year -- human sexuality should not be a politically divisive issue , since it truly concerns us all			1
" if you do find yourself in a relationship with someone of the opposite political party , take heart -- and follow @entity52 's advice			0
" do n't define yourself by your political affiliation			0
you 're a husband , a wife , a brother , a sister , a daughter , a son , " he says			0
" use the different opinions to learn something new			0
with every political view is a possible discussion where you can learn about your partner			0
set ground rules about when to argue -- and know when to walk away			0
" so this election season , look past the parties and cast your vote for a happy , healthy relationship			0
the opinions expressed are solely those of @entity178 .			0

political differences may be a boost to some relationships
