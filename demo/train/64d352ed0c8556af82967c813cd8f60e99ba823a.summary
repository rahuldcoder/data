@entity0 , @entity1 -- six months ago , i stood on a corner in @entity0 , in northeastern @entity1 and believed this small city would never recover from the devastation caused by the march 11 earthquake and tsunami			1
i was n't being a pessimist			2
it was simply that my eyes could barely comprehend the damage to this town			0
cars sat atop four - story apartment buildings , as entire neighborhoods looked as if the homes had been placed in a blender			1
a fishing vessel was even swept from its mooring onto a street			0
but the physical damage paled in comparison to the human toll			0
missing person notices wallpapered the makeshift city hall			1
the line of family members filing for death certificates went from one side of the building to the other			0
living with aftermath of @entity1 's tsunami to an outsider it appeared @entity0 had little to offer other than grief and despair moving forward			1
@entity39 , a city worker , feared the living would abandon the city , killing what the tsunami did not			1
in his unheated city office , @entity45 told me in march that @entity0 was his city , the only place he ever wanted to and hoped to live			1
" i fear the residents may be too afraid to come back and live here again , " he said			0
but when i asked if @entity0 as a city would cease to exist , @entity45 was emphatic			1
" i am convinced it will come back			0
i will do all that i can for that			0
" he paused , tears choking his next sentence			0
" this is the city i was born in			1
i do n't want to lose my hometown			0
i want to see my city come back			2
" i met up with @entity45 again recently , my first trip to @entity0 since the immediate aftermath of the tsunami			1
he was keen to point out the progress made in the reconstruction effort			1
the change in @entity0 's downtown is remarkable			1
the massive job of clearing debris , while not complete , has been successful throughout much of the city			2
the hotel around the corner , he said , is back in business			0
look down the street , he added , smiling , there 's no debris			0
but what makes @entity45 most proud is being able to report that only 2,000 people from this city of 39,000 have actually left			2
" @entity0 will come back and will become an even better city , " he said			1
" that sort of spirit did n't exist before the tsunami			2
but we all have a passion and we 're all determined			0
" but he admits the city still faces massive challenges			2
the steel and fishing industries , @entity0 's economic base , have yet to resume their operations , while many businesses and jobs have not returned			1
thousands of people , including @entity45 , his wife and two children , are in temporary housing , with no immediate prospect of an income			1
but one by one the city is tackling each obstacle , united in its goal			2
" at the end of each day , i now think ' another day has ended and i 'm glad to have lived this day , ' " reflected @entity45			0
" and i 'm glad when morning comes			0

much of @entity0 looked as if it had been placed in a blender after the tsunami
@entity39 , a *spokesman* for the city , feared the living would abandon the city
six months later , the city in northeastern @entity1 has made huge progress
but many businesses still remain *closed* , with thousands still in temporary housing
