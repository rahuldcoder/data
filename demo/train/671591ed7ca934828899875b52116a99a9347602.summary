by 2030 , the top cancer killers in the @entity1 will be lung , pancreas and liver , according to a new report published monday in the @entity7 's journal			1
lung cancer is already the top killer overall , but pancreatic and liver cancer will surpass the cancers currently considered the second and third leading causes of death , researchers say			1
right now , second most dangerous is breast cancer for women and prostate cancer for men ; and third is colorectal cancer for both men and women			2
researchers looked at trends in cancer incidence and death rates between 2006 and 2010 , and used that data -- combined with expected @entity1 demographic changes -- to predict numbers for 2030			1
overall , the cancer - related death rate has been decreasing , researchers say , as a result of improved screening and treatment options			1
yet while deaths from breast , prostate and colon cancers are projected to drop , deaths caused by liver , pancreatic , bladder and leukemia cancers are expected to increase			1
in fact , liver and pancreatic cancers will surpass breast and prostate to become the second and third - leading causes of cancer - related deaths , the researchers say			1
" we 've been able to turn the tide in other cancers , with an investment in ( research ) , " said lead author @entity54 , vice president of scientific and medical affairs at the @entity56 , which funded the study			0
" we 're hoping that with increased effort ... we will be able to impact and change those projections			0
" the rate of pancreatic cancer has been slowly increasing for the past 15 years , says dr. @entity66 , chief medical officer of the @entity67			1
some of that rise can be attributed to the prevalence of obesity and diabetes			0
" many @entity1 are not aware that the combination of obesity , high - caloric intake and lack of physical activity is the second - leading cause of cancer in the @entity1 , " @entity66 said			1
" it is linked to at least 12 types of cancer , of which these are two			0
this is an @entity1 problem ... the rise in pancreatic cancer is not as severe as in @entity86 where obesity is less of an issue			1
" obesity may affect cancer patients ' outcomes overall , the number of cancer cases is expected to increase over the next 16 years , due to the rapidly aging population			1
in 2010 , the @entity1 had about 1.5 million cases of cancer ; in 2030 , researchers expect that number to reach 2.1 million			0
" we 're living much longer in the @entity1 , so the number of people 65 age and older will be much greater , " @entity54 said			0
" and that 's , of course , one of the biggest risk factors for cancer : age			0
" lung , breast , prostate and colorectal cancers are currently the most common in the @entity1			1
known as the " big four , " these cancers have the highest incidence rates and receive the most research funding from the @entity117			2
this is unlikely to change by 2030 , the researchers say , except for colorectal cancer , which is expected to be surpassed by thyroid , melanoma and uterine cancers in total number of cases			0
" the decrease in colorectal cancer , falling from the top four incidence and top two in deaths , seems to be primarily the result of advances in colorectal cancer screening , " the report authors write			0
the dramatic increase in thyroid cases is not a new epidemic , they say , but simply an increase in the number of cases being diagnosed			0
and while thyroid cancer has a 98 % five - year survival rate , only 6 % of pancreatic cancer patients are alive five years after diagnosis			2
the pancreas is difficult to scan with current imaging technologies , @entity54 says , because of its location in the body			0
and pancreatic tumors are often surrounded by dense tissue that render drugs useless			0
surgery is the only treatment known to cure pancreatic cancer , but less than 20 % of cases are operable , the report says			2
" if we want to change the death rate for these diseases , it is necessary to increase the investment in understanding them and identifying early detection strategies , " the report says .			2

liver , pancreatic cancers to surpass breast , prostate as leading causes of death
rate of pancreatic cancer has been increasing *steadily* , in part because of obesity
aging population will increase cancer incidence rates in the @entity1 and *abroad*
