-- the @entity1 picked up steam throughout the weekend , despite a somewhat unimpressive start			0
early estimates show that @entity7 ' " @entity6 " ( @entity8 : a ) could bring in $ 70.6 million on the three - day weekend , and $ 84.1 million for the four and a half days that it has been open			1
though nothing to scoff at , it 's still underperforming according to initial projections , which hoped for a $ 100 million extended weekend and $ 80 million on the three - day			1
the first " @entity17 " of the @entity7 era opened in early may of 2009 and made an impressive $ 75.2 million on its first weekend out of the gates , without the benefit of @entity16 surcharges			1
this newest film is showing in 336 @entity21 theaters , whereas the first showed in 138 @entity24 venues — accounting for $ 8.5 million in ticket sales on its first weekend			2
@entity0 review : " @entity6 " as we previously said , the nature of @entity7 ' four different directing projects makes him difficult to analyze in terms of pure box office numbers , so his " @entity17 " successes and potential will have to stand on its own			1
the first film stayed in theaters for 21 weeks , ultimately grossing $ 257.7 million for @entity37			2
this is a franchise that seems separate from its stars			0
@entity43 , who plays @entity44 , for example , has not proven to be a box office draw on his own			1
again , this opening weekend is n't bad , but it 's interesting to think about why it could n't live up to early estimates — especially considering the runaway success of " @entity50			2
" perhaps four years is too big of a gap between films			0
there was a three - year gap between " @entity55 " and " @entity56 3 , " but releasing " @entity58 " during the hiatus was likely important for keeping the character present			0
" @entity50 " continues to do well at the box office in spite of the new competition from " @entity6 , " making an estimated $ 35.2 million in its third weekend in theaters			1
this brings its domestic total to $ 337.1 million			2
" @entity67 " took the no. 3 spot with a $ 23.4 million weekend , bringing its domestic total to an estimated $ 90.2 million			1
the $ 100 million mark is close for @entity69 , and it would be a first for the @entity72 director , even accounting for price inflation			2
this could partially be the @entity76 effect , the ubiquity and appeal of the novel , or an indication that there is room amidst sci - fi and comic book blockbusters for other types of films — even if this literary adaptation is also a @entity16 release			0
@entity76 : could anyone else have been @entity90 ? the no. 4 spot went to @entity93 's " @entity92 , " which made $ 3.1 million in 2,429 locations			1
it 's only down 38 percent from last week despite the fact that it lost 874 theaters			0
the relatively inexpensive ( $ 26 million ) @entity100 / @entity99 flick has made $ 46.7 million domestically so far			1
rounding out the top five is " the @entity102 , " the @entity103 and @entity104 - voiced cave - family animated picture , which last appeared on the list two weeks ago			0
the $ 135 million movie has made an estimated $ 176.6 million domestically in its 9 weeks in theaters			1
as one of the only family friendly films available in theaters at the moment , it 's unsurprising that it continues to quietly do well			0
" @entity6 " — $ 70.6 million ( 3 - day ) 2			1
" @entity50 " — $ 35.2 million 3			1
" @entity67 " -- $ 23.4 million 4			2
" @entity92 " — $ 3.1 million 5			0
" the @entity102 " — $ 2.8 million @entity118 's " @entity117 " also opened this weekend in four theaters , bringing in $ 134,000 with an impressive per theater average			2
@entity118 's previous three films all played in under 200 theaters			0
check back next weekend for some powerhouse face - offs , with @entity123 's " @entity124 , " @entity125 " @entity122 " and @entity127 's " @entity126 " all opening wide			0
