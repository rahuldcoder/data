-- can killer whales sue @entity2 for enslavement ? a lawsuit filed wednesday by @entity5 and other " next friends " of five @entity2 killer whales takes that novel legal approach			1
the 20 - page complaint asks the @entity10 in @entity11 to declare that the five whales -- @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 -- are being held in slavery or involuntary servitude in violation of the 13th amendment			2
a @entity5 statement said the lawsuit is the first of its kind in contending that constitutional protections against slavery are not limited to humans			1
" plaintiffs were forcibly taken from their families and natural habitats , are held captive at @entity36 and @entity37 , denied everything that is natural to them , subjected to artificial insemination or sperm collection to breed performers for defendants ' shows , and forced to perform , all for defendants ' profit , " the lawsuit says , arguing that those conditions amount to enslavement and / or forced servitude			0
a @entity2 statement called the lawsuit a baseless publicity stunt by @entity5 , which is known for provocative advertisements and public demonstrations on behalf of animal rights			1
at the heart of the lawsuit is the question of whether a non-human entity can sue for a violation of constitutional rights			2
the 13th @entity21 outlaws slavery and " involuntary servitude " in the @entity61 without any specific mention that it applies only to people			0
" neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the @entity61 , or any place subject to their jurisdiction , " says the amendment 's first section			0
in its statement , @entity5 called the lawsuit " the first ever seeking to apply the @entity21 to non-human animals			1
" the lawsuit seeks an order for the release of the whales " from bondage " and a permanent order against holding them in slavery , as well as appointment of a legal guardian to carry out the transfer of the whales to a suitable habitat			2
in addition , it seeks attorneys ' fees and costs			0
the " next friends " joining @entity5 in representing the killer whales are three marine mammal experts , including @entity95 , who was featured in the @entity98 - winning documentary " @entity102 " about dolphin - hunting in @entity100 , and two former @entity2 trainers			1
their lawsuit contends killer whales -- @entity111 , the largest species of the dolphin family -- " possess sophisticated learning , problem solving , and communicative abilities , " as well as " distinctive cultural traits			1
" in a statement responding to the lawsuit , @entity114 said the court case challenges " the public 's right to enjoy and learn more about marine mammals			0
" " this effort to extend the @entity21 's solemn protections beyond human beings is baseless and in many ways offensive , " the statement says			0
@entity2 is " among the world 's most respected zoological institutions , " it continues , adding that @entity2 parks " are fully accredited by the @entity129 and the @entity130 " with legal permission to display marine mammals			2
" @entity5 has once again showed that it prefers publicity stunts to the hard work of caring for , rescuing and helping animals , " the @entity2 statement said			1
state and federal courts have traditionally understood laws dealing with animal ownership and cruelty as applying only to human actions , meaning the animals themselves could neither be prosecuted nor act as plaintiffs or defendants			0
that would include litigation and legislation involving hunting and breeding of animals and plants , as well as zoo and circus displays .			0
