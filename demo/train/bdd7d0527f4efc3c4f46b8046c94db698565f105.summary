@entity0 -- six months after the improbable revolt that toppled one of the world 's longest - serving rulers , protesters are once again camping in @entity0 's @entity7 to demand speedy change			1
the president they ousted , @entity9 , faces a possible death sentence if he survives a variety of ailments that have left him hospital - bound since april			2
the tourists who once flocked to the pyramids of @entity16 and the beaches of the @entity18 have yet to return , and the joblessness and poverty that fueled the protests is deeper than before			2
the result is a revolution that remains incomplete , with the coalition that formed in @entity7 splintering over different visions of a @entity27 future			1
but few dispute that the uprising launched on january 25 has changed an ancient nation in a fundamental way			2
" i am optimistic about the future			0
we ca n't go back , " said @entity33 , a photographer who was taking part in the protests			1
" the wall of fear has fallen , and the people will now demand their rights and stay on the streets			2
" and @entity42 , director of the @entity43 at the @entity44 , said @entity45 have undergone a " psychological rapture " since the revolution			1
" the psychology of the citizen has changed , " he said			0
" millions of voiceless people have regained their voices ... it 's changed the relationship between sons and fathers and fathers and daughters			0
" the protests lasted 18 days , growing despite clashes with police and @entity62 gangs			0
the armed forces refused to intercede on @entity9 's behalf , and he handed over power to a council of generals on february 11			0
the generals suspended @entity45 's constitution and named a civilian caretaker government , but remain the final authority in @entity0			1
that 's one of the things that rankles the protesters who have made camp in @entity7 since a fresh round of protests in june			1
" for me to leave @entity7 , the ruling generals need to listen to our demands and take action to ensure them , " said @entity78 , a 16 - year - old high - school student taking part in the protests last week			1
" we also want a clear schedule , a path to elections and reform			0
we want a plan that lays out the future			0
" @entity91 , a lawyer and human rights activist , said the revolution " is n't going too bad			1
" but she said patience will be needed for months or even years to come			0
" it will take 5 to 10 years to evaluate the revolution , " said @entity95 , whose group helped organize the first protests			0
" nobody can evaluate it now			0
any evaluation now is premature			1
" with liberals , nationalists , leftists and @entity105 now split over whether elections or constitutional reforms should come first , @entity42 said the protesters are realizing an old lesson : " revolutions are messy			1
" but those debates are " a healthy sign that civil society is still alive			0
" " my worry is the cleavages are much deeper than we think , and the question is , will there be a government that will be able to govern in the next two or three years ? " @entity42 said			2
" if you do n't have a consensus on what the future is , you wo n't be able to govern			2
" @entity125 , a former media consultant at the @entity126 , has been critical of the path the revolution has taken			0
she said secular political parties need more time to organize as a counterweight to the long - suppressed @entity131			0
" right now , the @entity131 is the only strong party , and we need more diversity , " she said			0
but @entity42 said the @entity131 has its own divisions , with younger members " closer to the nationalists and the liberals and the leftists than the old guard			0
" the military 's decision recent decision to delay parliamentary elections until november is a concession to the secular groups , said @entity146 , an analyst at the @entity148 - based branch of the @entity149			2
@entity146 said that vote " will clarify matters , " demonstrating which of the competing factions " have the support and capability to push things forward and challenge the military 's hold on power			2
" @entity125 took part in the january protests at @entity7 and said most @entity45 still support the revolution , but are " fed up " with the new demonstrations			1
" i understand the chaos after a revolution , but i do n't see the people in @entity7 now as revolutionaries , " she said			1
and @entity146 called the renewed protests a " frightening turn " in post-revolutionary @entity45			1
" more and more , the military staff is being portrayed as an enemy of democracy and an enemy of the transition , at least among the people in @entity7 , " @entity146 said			1
neither side appears willing to back down , " and it increasingly looks like the interests of both sides are in some ways impossible to reconcile			2
" @entity45 's military has been the backbone of the state since 1952 , when col. @entity183 led a coup that toppled the country 's monarchy -- and the generals will likely try to keep much of that influence in any new government , said @entity190 , a @entity43 analyst at @entity191			1
" there 's no question the military does not want to be responsible for collecting the trash and running the schools and the health - care system and the economy , which is a mess , " @entity190 told @entity1			1
" they do n't want civilian oversight when they do go back to the barracks , and they do n't want to lose a privileged position in @entity45 political and social life			1
" but that sort of privilege may be harder to come by in the new @entity45			1
during the march referendum on changes to the country 's constitution , @entity190 said , newspapers carried stories about @entity215 who showed up at polling places where long lines had formed , expecting to be allowed to vote ahead of the hoi polloi			0
" every time this happened , they were told , ' wait a minute , this is a different country now			0
you 've got to wait in line , ' " he said			0
" it 's a less deferential , less hierarchical place than it used to be			1
" @entity146 said the most realistic outcome is that the military will keep " some control " over international affairs and defense policy in a new government , as well as its extensive economic interests			1
but he said the generals appear to be boxing in the debate over their own authority in advance			0
at the same time , @entity45 are awaiting a reckoning with @entity9 and some of the leading figures in his former regime			1
@entity9 and his ex-interior minster , @entity241 , are accused of ordering police to use live ammunition on protesters -- a charge that could carry a death sentence upon conviction			2
several other figures , including @entity9 's two sons , face public corruption charges			0
and @entity33 said some of the generals need to be in the dock as well			0
" the main generals were part of the @entity9 regime and part of the corruption , " she said			0
" we need to dig into their files and prosecute them			0
" @entity42 said the show trials that followed the 1952 coup " did a great deal of damage to the whole question of justice , " and warned that similar treatment of @entity9 would be " horrible for @entity45			1
" " i do hope that the @entity45 judicial system and @entity45 resist the temptation for vengeance and give @entity9 and his cronies a day in court and due process , " he said			2
and @entity125 said what @entity45 needs is a process like @entity279 's post-apartheid @entity277 , in which those responsible for human rights abuses became eligible for amnesty if they came forward and testified truthfully about their actions			1
" i do n't believe it is right to call everyone who worked in the old regime as corrupt , " she said			2
" you either agree in the system and let the law decide about the people , or you take matters into your own hands and act like they are acting			0
" this story is based on reporting done by journalist @entity296 in @entity0 , @entity45 , and @entity1 's @entity297 in @entity298 , @entity299 , who wrote it .			1

" any evaluation now is premature , " a human rights lawyer tells @entity1
protesters in @entity7 are calling for speedier reforms
the new @entity45 is a " less deferential , " more *outspoken* place , *observers* say
some worry that interests of military , protesters ca n't be reconciled
