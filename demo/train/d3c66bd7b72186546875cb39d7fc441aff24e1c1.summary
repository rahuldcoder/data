@entity19 , @entity20 : fridays are awesome ! thank you for wrapping up your week with @entity0			1
first up : @entity5 settlements @entity26 : first up , a @entity28 meeting between president @entity29 and the head of the @entity31			1
president @entity32 sat down with @entity29 yesterday , just as @entity34 prime minister @entity33 did last week			1
they 're all discussing the same topic : possibilities for a @entity39 peace plan			1
one of the big issues : @entity34 settlements in the @entity31 - controlled @entity5			1
@entity29 and @entity32 want @entity34 to stop settlement activity , but @entity33 has pledged to expand it			1
@entity44 is in the region , and reports on the situation there			1
( @entity49 ) @entity50 , @entity0 correspondent : we 're right next to @entity52 , which is the biggest @entity54 settlement in the @entity5			1
now , @entity34 prime minister @entity33 has said , he 's insisted , that he wants natural expansion , or growth , to occur in those settlements which means that settlements like @entity52 are going to get bigger and bigger			1
and that 's something the @entity60 are completely opposed to			1
now , what you see on the other side of this valley is the town , the @entity31 town of @entity66 , known from the @entity67 as @entity68			1
now , this town is right up against @entity70 , in fact many people consider it part of @entity70 , but it 's separated from @entity70 by the @entity34 so - called security barrier , what the @entity60 call the apartheid separation wall			2
it can not have growth in the direction of @entity70 because of the wall , and because of @entity52 , it ca n't expand in that direction			2
i 'm @entity44 , @entity0 , reporting from @entity84 on the occupied @entity5			1
( @entity85 ) international highlights @entity26 : catching up on a couple other international headlines , beginning with a series of deadly explosions in @entity90			2
this took place last night in and around the city of @entity94			2
at least eight people were killed in the violence and dozens of others were wounded			2
the attacks came one day after a suicide bombing in the @entity90 city of @entity101			2
and parts of @entity103 are recovering from a deadly earthquake			2
reports yesterday evening indicated that five people had been killed and 17 others injured by the tremor			2
officials say the quake , which struck early thursday morning , registered a magnitude of 7.1			2
it was followed 30 minutes later by a 4.8 - magnitude aftershock			2
@entity114 @entity115 , @entity20 : here 's the deal : today 's @entity114 is budget			1
it 's a financial plan that estimates income and expenses			2
put that in your word bank ! @entity6 ? @entity26 : the state of @entity9 is facing a budget crisis			1
the state is struggling with a multi-billion dollar deficit			2
in a recent special election , voters cast their ballots against some plans that governor @entity131 designed to help the state 's budget			1
now , he says @entity9 has to make some severe cuts			1
@entity135 explores how one might have a big impact on students			1
( @entity49 ) @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 : @entity141 grew up on the rough - and - tumble streets of @entity143 , @entity9			1
he says a strong grandmother kept him out of trouble			2
@entity146 , @entity148 's grandmother : i 'm strict with him			2
@entity151 : when he graduates from high school next month -- he 's number three in his class -- @entity156 would be the first person in his family to go to college			2
he 's been accepted at @entity159			2
@entity148 , high school senior : it makes me feel good that i was doing all the right stuff and doing all the hard work to go , and maybe i can be a guidance to my young cousins and nephews that maybe they 'll want to go to college , too			2
@entity151 : he wants to become a lawyer , but that dream could be shattered because of @entity9 's budget woes			1
the state facing an unprecedented deficit is looking at ways to save billions , and governor @entity131 has proposed slashing what are called @entity179 , money that helps pay tuition for students from low income families			1
200,000 students statewide could lose all or part of the @entity179 they were counting on to pay for college this fall			1
@entity148 : the whole way through school , the teachers and all that tell you as long as you get good grades and all that , the state and the system will find a way to send you to school			2
@entity151 : a promise that would have to be taken back if the proposed cuts happen			1
without @entity179 , @entity141 would lose nearly a third of the money for his $ 27,000 a year tuition and other expenses			2
@entity203 is the college counselor at @entity141 's school			0
she says the ripple effects would be enormous			0
@entity206 , college counselor : our main problem is just getting students to even look at college , because in their head , already , its been ingrained that it 's too expensive as well as with parents ; they do n't want students to apply , because , " oh , it 's too expensive , " so we always talk about about @entity179			1
@entity151 : @entity141 has this message for lawmakers making the touch choices			0
@entity148 : by helping me go to school they wo n't have another person on welfare just taking state money to survive			0
they 'll have another person working , making money for the state			0
( @entity85 ) @entity229 @entity230 : today 's @entity229 goes out to mr. @entity233 's @entity232 classes at @entity234 in @entity235 , @entity236 ! how are tropical depressions identified ? is it by : a ) female names , b ) male names , c ) @entity242 or @entity243 ) @entity244 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! tropical depressions are assigned numbers ; they do n't get names until they become tropical storms			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity252 @entity26 : we already have our first of the year			0
@entity255 formed off the eastern @entity11 coast yesterday			1
forecasters do n't expect it to be much of a threat			0
of course , when these storms increase in intensity , they can become hurricanes , and as we 've seen in recent years , some can cause serious damage			0
@entity265 looks at how prepared we are as hurricane season begins			1
( @entity49 ) @entity267 , @entity268 : @entity269 : rebuilding the seawall continues after @entity271			0
@entity272 : the fortified levees are inspected			0
@entity274 : rehearsal for a massive coastal evacuation			0
days before the start of hurricane season , preseason drills and preparations are nearly complete			1
you 've been paying attention , right ? surely , you 've heard the chorus of warnings			0
@entity285 , @entity11 commerce secretary : public awareness and public preparedness are the best defenses against a hurricane			1
and that defense is more important than ever			0
@entity292 : the @entity272 mayor			0
@entity295 @entity294 , ( @entity243 ) @entity272 : each citizen must have a personal evacuation and recovery plan that accounts for your entire family			0
@entity302 , @entity303 : plan now			0
know what to do , so you 'll be ready when the storm threatens			0
@entity292 : with so much drums beating , everyone living in hurricane - prone communities is ready , right ? well , no. not hardly			1
a new @entity311 poll sponsored by the @entity312 found most people surveyed from @entity314 to @entity315 have done little to get ready , despite recent big ones : @entity317 , @entity318 and , last year , @entity271			0
83 % of the 1,100 people surveyed have taken no steps to make their homes stronger			0
66 % have no hurricane survival kits ; basics like food and water for three days			1
53 % do n't know if their insurance policy covers hurricane damage			1
every year , surveys find hurricane apathy pretty much unchanged , no matter how bad the season was			1
sociologists chalk it up to human nature : procrastinate			0
emergency managers say the " uh oh " factor will kick in when			0
@entity337 , @entity339 emergency manager : i saw people really do when the big ones are coming , they get prepared			1
@entity292 : but this year , emergency managers fear because of the economy , many people ca n't afford to stock up			0
@entity346 : we 'd like people to set aside a little bit of money and buy a little bit of the supplies that they need now , and a little bit more every week as they get the money			0
@entity292 : if they just ca n't , experts say now 's the time to come up with a plan to evacuate			0
( @entity85 ) off the @entity359 @entity26 : and finally today , we 're taking a look at some stories from the lighter side of news			0
so , prepare your taste buds for a tempting trip off the beaten path			0
( @entity49 ) @entity26 : he definitely ai n't the world 's fastest coffee server			0
@entity372 , @entity373 : you better never be a hurry when you 're in here			0
@entity26 : but if you do n't need your espresso express - o , impress your senses with a picture - perfect latte ! @entity379 is an artist and a barista at the same time			0
and if you 're into image and taste , you wo n't mind if this takes a latt - e time			0
for a different flavor ... @entity385 , teacher : i made the deal , and i 'm just gon na have to accept the consequences			0
@entity26 : but for most of us , this would be a deal breaker : worms for lunch			0
the @entity272 fourth grade teacher promised her students that she 'd have grubs for grub if they grubbed up good grades			1
they did their part , so bon appetit ! on the menu : @entity402 , @entity403 : the mealworms are grubs that turn into beatles			0
@entity26 : well , they would have , if they could 've wormed their way out of this			0
some students even stepped up to the table ! but if the worms ' woes seem in bad taste , they still make for one good segment			1
and who can argue with a fudge dessert ? at least , until you find out it 's filled with crickets			0
i guess there 'll be no chirping on this trip @entity425			0
( @entity85 ) goodbye @entity26 : from earthworm entrees to an insect ending ? that whole meal sounds like one big gag			0
time to bug out for the weekend			0
hope you have a great one .			0
