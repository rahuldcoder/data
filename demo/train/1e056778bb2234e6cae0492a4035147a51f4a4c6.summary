@entity0 -- the @entity2 has gone to the dogs , and at least one justice found the results to be laughable			1
the @entity7 television news satire " @entity8 " found a clever way to illustrate the court 's public sessions , which are closed to cameras			1
audio of the oral arguments -- where the justices debate the issues with opposing counsel -- is recorded and made available to the public			1
the solution -- pair each of the nine robed justices -- as well as the lawyers and court staff -- with a dog ( or a duck in one case ) , with fake paws			1
it 's an exercise in democracy that has to be watched for the full effect			2
the work of the court is very important , but the current courtroom setup without cameras is " boring " to the general public , making media coverage " unwatchable , " said the show 's host @entity37			1
but with animals sitting on a mock bench over actual audio of the nine justices , " the video makes it irresistible			1
" the featured case was from earlier this month , over whether a @entity47 prisoner had a @entity49 right to keep his beard for religious reasons , in the face of strict security policies by corrections officers			0
" i thought it was hilarious , " justice @entity55 said of the dog video at a @entity0 event earlier this week			1
" and i imagine my colleagues who have seen it would share that view			0
" @entity55 was portrayed as a @entity62 , complete with glasses			1
for the record the other members of the court and their canine counterparts : chief justice @entity68 ( @entity70 shorthaired pointer ) ; and justices @entity72 ( bulldog ) ; @entity74 ( boxer ) ; @entity76 ( @entity77 ) ; @entity78 ( beagle ) ; @entity80 ( @entity82 water dog ) ; @entity83 ( @entity85 terrier ) ; and @entity86 ( bull terrier )			1
the playfully mocking tone of the skit raises a more serious concern			0
there have been calls for years to allow cameras in the court , for public benefit			1
a television ad released in february urged the justices to do just that , saying , " it 's time for a more open judiciary			2
" the biggest concerns raised by the justices are that having cameras will upset the personal dynamic between them that make oral arguments so unique and useful to their later deliberations and opinion - writing			2
most of them -- past and present -- have been opposed to cameras , while denying they operate in " secret			0
" @entity72 and the now - retired @entity113 have been particularly outspoken			0
@entity113 told a congressional panel in 1996 that cameras in the high court would come " over my dead body			2
" @entity72 has said he worried the media would only air tiny snippets of video from a detailed case being argued , thereby giving a distorted impression of what the court does			2
" it 's news entertainment , and whatever , and they ( the media ) want ' man bites dog ' stories , " he has said			0
" they do n't want people to watch what the @entity2 does over the course of a whole hour argument			0
" for the record , no man bit any of the dogs in the making of the new video , but one animal was seen drinking sloppily from a glass			2
on the bench , the justices wear plain black robes and are referred to by their official title			0
off the bench , however , the court 's oldest member might prefer a t - shirt and her fresh moniker : notorious @entity55 a hip fan page tribute to the pioneering jurist on the microblogging site @entity152 -- " @entity55 in all her glory " -- includes a way to show your admiration -- buy a t - shirt featuring the diminutive @entity159 native			1
she told @entity161 's @entity160 at a @entity163 event earlier this month that she gives them away to friends			0
" i think a law clerk told me about this @entity152 and also explained to me what @entity166 was a parody on			1
and now my grandchildren love it and i try to keep abreast of the latest that 's on the @entity152 , " she said			1
" i have quite a large supply " of the shirts			0
@entity55 has previously applauded @entity173 , a law student at @entity174 , who created the site and the nickname -- a play on the late rapper @entity178 , who was also known as @entity178 it 's not the only @entity55 - palooza floating around popular culture			1
after her recent sharp dissents in cases involving affirmative action and voting rights gained national attention , activists began placing homemade stickers around the nation 's capital , labeled " @entity183			0
" there 's even a tribute song on @entity195			0
the 81 - year - old justice has seen a recent surge in popularity , and -- rare for a sitting justice -- has given a number of media interviews in the past year			0
she has publicly , but politely , resisted calls from many on the left to step down from the bench now , to give president @entity207 another chance to enhance his legacy with a justice who might serve for decades			0
@entity72 , her best friend on the court , has also attracted his share of fan - boy support , with various tribute forums , including http://ninomania.blogspot.com / .			2

@entity37 's " @entity8 " used dogs to illustrate the court 's public sessions , which are closed to cameras
dogs were robed to represent each justice on the court while audio from the hearing played in the *background*
justice @entity55 called the video " hilarious "
@entity230 is also a fan of a @entity152 page that sells " @entity166 " shirts
