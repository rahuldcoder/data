-- matchmaker and dating coach @entity1 is responsible for 750 marriages , and she does n't believe you will find the love of your life by waiting for him / her to spontaneously appear in line at the grocery store or sit next to you on the subway			1
this @entity17 and @entity18 best - selling author advocates a better way -- being proactive and approaching your dating life like a job search			1
sure , there has to be an intersection of luck , timing , and opportunity , to find love , " she says , " but you increase your odds when you do something about it			1
if you have a strategic organized plan , something will come through faster			2
" so , uh , what should this plan be ? her new book , " have him at @entity38 : confessions from 1,000 @entity40 ... or never call back , " just hit bookstores and has some ingenious ideas for us			2
i had the opportunity to chat with @entity1 and get a singles state of the union			1
here 's eight interesting tips i learned			2
the @entity0 : online dating is making me depressed 1			1
the " no effort mentality " is crazy			2
we are officially the instant gratification dating generation			1
if love does n't happen instantly , we 're out of there			1
but anything worth having takes work			0
@entity1 points out that we are willing to put effort into other things in our lives -- our careers , our friendships , our hobbies , our living space -- but we expect our love lives to come effortlessly			1
" you would n't expect to be a ceo in five seconds , " @entity1 points out			1
it takes a village to find mr. or mrs. right			0
an important step in working on your love life is letting people know that you 're looking			2
a lot of us are embarrassed to reach out for help when it comes to finding love			2
we think it seems desperate to admit that we would like to find someone to spend the rest of our lives with			0
i 'm totally not talking about myself , by the way			0
" the stigma is all in your head , " says @entity1			1
" that 's like someone saying ' i 'm unemployed but too embarrassed to find a job			0
' " @entity1 suggests thinking of all the people in our lives as possible networking opportunities			1
the @entity0 : i slept with your husband and here 's why 3			0
stop asking " where ? " ask " how ? " asking a friend , co-worker , family member , or acquaintance where you can meet a great guy is a dead - end question			0
when you mention in casual conversation to your " village " that you are looking to meet someone this year , ask " how			0
" that way you are enlisting them in your search			0
" how ? " is a far more proactive and empowering question			0
it implies suggestions and solutions			0
there 's no stigma about dating online anymore -- one - fourth of the people who got married last year met online			1
so , if you do n't already have a rocking online profile ... make one			2
but @entity1 also recommends @entity122 as an alternative source			1
" why not throw a @entity122 party ? " she suggests			1
" send out a tweet to your friends and tell them that you 're having happy hour drinks on friday at your favorite bar			2
tell them to bring friends			2
" @entity1 's also a big fan of @entity132			1
" it 's much more sophisticated then it was a few years ago , " she says			0
you can search something like " singles , @entity138 , film lovers , " and find groups that meet in your area			0
you can even click through the groups and see mini-profiles and pictures of the members			0
do n't forget about @entity147 ! one - third of married people met through introductions by friends			1
following that logic , @entity147 may be our single most underused resource			1
" treat @entity147 like an online dating profile , " says @entity1			1
if a guy sees a bad photo of you on @entity147 or weird things on your profile , he may not give you a chance			1
" @entity1 suggests crafting the image you want to project on @entity147			1
" pick five words that represent you and make sure your @entity147 profile reflects those five words , " she says			1
once you 're satisfied with your profile , she suggested playing a game she calls " @entity168			0
" here 's how it works : give yourself 10 days to cruise around your friends ' @entity147 pages and find 50 guys that you think are interesting			1
then scope out their profiles and write them a message			0
hey , you already know someone in common			0
married people are a great resource			2
they know a thing or two about relationships , but more importantly , they know other single people who are marriage - minded			0
plus , they 're much more eager to see you settle down than your single friends			2
the @entity0 : why women should ask men out on dates 7			0
you may have tried it all , but have you tried it well ? trying something once or twice is n't enough			2
" doing online dating with a bad profile picture or going to a singles event and leaving after you scanned the room once is like looking for a job with a poorly written resume or applying for a sales job [ when ] you 're an accountant , " says @entity1			1
instead , take a look at what you 've been trying and how , and think of ways to do it better			0
it 's ok to outsource			0
how do we know what we 're doing wrong in our dating lives ? @entity1 says that there 's no shame in hiring a dating coach			1
hey , we have personal trainers , therapists , and head hunters			0
outsourcing is part of our culture -- yet we feel we can tackle the dating thing on our own			2
why ? ok , i 'm sold			0
i will definitely be trying out some of this advice			0
