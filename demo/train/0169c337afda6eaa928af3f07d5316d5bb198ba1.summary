-- " a tragedy with a happy ending " -- is n't that what we want ? people generally concentrate on the happy ending part of that sentence , taking it for evidence of a taste for mass delusion or collective amnesia			2
the movies overwhelmingly give us happy endings			2
but too many give us happy beginnings and middles , too , as if we 're incapable of enjoying the meat in a sandwich			2
@entity21 keeps a smile on his face -- all six of his films could be called comedies -- but he does n't shirk from the other part of the equation , either			2
he 's touched on incest ( " @entity32 " ) , adoption ( " @entity34 " ) , the @entity35 ( " @entity36 " ) , drug dependency ( " @entity38 " -- not exactly a comedy , but a film with as many laughs as most ) , and even existential despair ( " @entity31 " )			1
putting the " antic " into " romantic " , " @entity44 " , is a comedy about clinical depression			1
cynics might roll their eyes -- me too , actually -- but the movie plays like a dream			2
it defeated " @entity56 " for the @entity51 at the @entity52 in september , the first harbinger of the @entity55 season			0
in his most credible attempt to break out of the " light leading man " mantle ( which is not to say he 's all that credible ) , @entity57 plays @entity62 , a @entity64 high school history teacher tipped off his bipolar axis after finding his wife showering with another faculty member			1
released from the hospital after several months , he returns to live with his parents ( @entity70 and @entity71 ) and determined to win back the love of his life -- hopefully without encroaching on the restraining order			1
a blind date with his best friend 's recently widowed and equally traumatized sister - in - law @entity77 ( @entity79 ) furnishes the manically overoptimistic @entity62 with a co-conspirator , and , he hopes , a back channel to his ex. but @entity77 has her own agenda and her own needs -- including a dance partner for an upcoming competition			1
this last item would seem to be a sure recipe for the purest cinematic cheese , but @entity21 does n't let it curdle			0
he 's the ideal director to bring @entity92 's best - seller to the screen because he 's too edgy to wallow			0
just as " @entity38 " fended off punch drunk " rocky " euphorics with a series of swift , cruel jabs , the brisk , eccentric " @entity44 " resists settling into a feel - good groove			1
by keeping things rough and raw -- his scenes are always an inch or three off - kilter , a little jerky and unpredictable -- @entity21 makes the jokes feel sharper , and the sentiment that much sweeter			0
in other words , he reminds us that silver linings are precious because they come attached to great big black clouds			0
nothing if not an actors ' movie , " @entity44 " provides @entity70 with his juiciest comic role since the first " @entity113			1
" his socially sanctioned , but deeply superstitious , obsession with football is as wild as anything going on with his son			0
@entity71 , the @entity119 actress who earned an @entity55 supporting nomination for " @entity121 , " is completely convincing as a loving wife and mom who 's in over her head in this chaotic household			0
and @entity126 ( yes , that @entity126 ) is a hoot as @entity62 's certifiably insane , but scrupulously polite hospital buddy			1
even then , the biggest takeaway has to be " @entity131 " star @entity130			0
she does n't just hold her own , she absolutely bosses her scenes , @entity70 and all			1
does " @entity44 " trivialize depression and mental illness ? in the end , i think you have to say it sugarcoats those things			1
but a little positive thinking never hurts : see this one with a receptive crowd			0
chances are you 'll come out feeling better than when you went in .			0
