-- another day , another @entity2 farce			1
football 's world governing body has already embarrassed itself on a number of occasions with its president , @entity8 , also getting in on the act			1
thursday 's debate between lead investigator @entity11 and @entity2 judge @entity12 over allegations of corruption during the @entity16 bidding process is just the latest episode in a whole catalog of ignominy			1
@entity8 , who has been in charge of @entity2 since 1998 , is hoping to stand for a fifth term as president next year			1
the 78 - year - old has presided over some of the organization 's most troubled times			1
here are a few reminders			0
@entity28 solved with a handshake yes , you read that right			0
in june 2011 , during an exclusive interview with @entity0 , @entity8 said that any racism on the field of play could be solved with a handshake			1
when asked if racism on the pitch was a problem , the @entity2 president said : " " i would deny it			1
" there is maybe one of the players towards another -- he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one			0
" but the one who is affected by that , he should say : ' this is a game			0
we are in a game , and at the end of the game , we shake hands			0
' and this can happen , because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination			0
" @entity8 later said that his remarks had been misunderstood and released a statement clarifying his position			1
let women wear ' tighter shorts ' @entity8 caused a stir in january 2004 when he suggested female footballers should wear " more feminine clothes			2
" " let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball , " he said at the time			0
" they could , for example , have tighter shorts			0
" @entity8 added : " female players are pretty , if you excuse me for saying so , and they already have some different rules to men -- such as playing with a lighter ball			2
" that decision was taken to create a more female aesthetic , so why not do it in fashion ? " no sex in @entity81 when @entity81 was awarded the @entity82 , @entity8 was asked about what gay football fans should do given that homosexuality is illegal in the @entity87 state			1
speaking in december 2010 , @entity8 joked : " i 'd say they ( gay fans ) should refrain from any sexual activities			2
" it was not my intention and never will be my intention to go into any discrimination , " @entity8 said			2
" if somebody feels hurt , then i regret and present apologies			0
" she 's a looker @entity8 was at it again in may 2013 at the 63rd @entity2 congress held in @entity100 where the executive committee elected three women			1
with the world waiting to hail @entity2 's progress , the president took center stage			1
he declared : " we now have three ladies on the board			0
say something , ladies ! you are always speaking at home , say something now ! " oh and before that , he had told everyone that one of the candidates , @entity118 's @entity117 was " good and good - looking			2
" affairs are ok ? in 2010 , @entity8 turned agony uncle to @entity124 's @entity123 following revelations that his @entity127 teammate , @entity126 , had been having an affair with his girlfriend @entity129			1
the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) stripped @entity126 of the @entity124 captaincy and @entity123 's relationship with the @entity134 model fell apart in front of the watching world			2
fortunately , @entity123 had @entity8 to turn to for some advice			2
" listen , this is a special approach in the @entity140 countries , " he said			0
" if this had happened in let 's say @entity143 countries then i think he ( @entity126 ) would have been applauded			0
" big screen @entity8 nothing massages the ego more than having your own film -- hence the production of " @entity151 , " a movie telling the story of how @entity2 came into existence			1
@entity2 coughed up a reported $ 8 million to help fund the film starring @entity156 as @entity8 , @entity134 actor @entity157 as @entity16 creator @entity158 and @entity159 as @entity160 , the disgraced former @entity2 president			1
the flick , which reportedly cost $ 27 million to make , failed to attract many viewers to its premiere in @entity164 earlier this year -- a reported 120 people bought tickets			0
@entity8 the stand - up comedian in october 2013 , @entity8 caused much mirth during a question and answer session at @entity171			1
the @entity164 was asked which player he preferred out of @entity173 and @entity174			0
one might have expected a straight answer -- but not this time			0
after saying that @entity174 was like a " commander on the field of play , " @entity8 got up from his chair and began to do a comic walk across the stage in a bizarre interpretation of the @entity186 star 's movement			1
it went down like a lead balloon -- especially with the @entity190 star who posted a sarcastic response on his @entity193 page			2
the two made peace in the end with @entity8 tweeting an apology			0
