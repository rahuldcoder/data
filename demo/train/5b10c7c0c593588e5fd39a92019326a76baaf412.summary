@entity1 , @entity0 -- in the @entity5 , @entity4 @entity3 is a longtime abortion opponent who has tried repeatedly to pass legislation in his state that would give rights to the unborn			1
this year , on his third try , @entity3 just might get his wish , and that has advocates for women 's reproductive rights concerned			1
the @entity5 passed a so - called " personhood " bill tuesday sponsored by @entity3 that would give unborn children at all stages of development -- including embryos -- the same rights available to " other persons " in the state " subject only to the laws and constitutions of @entity0 and the @entity27 , precedents of the @entity29 , and provisions to the contrary in the statutes of the @entity33			1
" " we need to get back to the respect for life that we used to have in this country that 's been lost , " @entity3 told @entity2			0
@entity0 is the latest front in a long - running battle over women 's reproductive rights -- a fight that has taken center stage in recent weeks after a controversial decision by the @entity46 administration to require religious groups to provide their employees access to birth control in their insurance plans at no cost			2
the administration later offered a compromise , after drawing fire from @entity55 leaders and other religious organizations			0
however , the issue has stayed in the headlines			0
@entity3 's bill must still be passed by the @entity60			1
if that happens , @entity62 gov. @entity62 's office has said he will review the measure if it reaches his desk , but he has not committed to signing it			1
opponents of the legislation believe it could restrict access not only to abortions but to some forms of contraception , like those that prevent implantation of fertilized eggs			1
@entity79 delegate @entity78 , who supports abortion rights , said the legislation represented an " overreach by the state			1
" " these decisions should be left to a woman and her physician , a medical professional , " @entity78 said			0
" this is a slippery slope and eventually , the goal of the personhood movement is to ensure that birth control is illegal			2
" @entity3 says his law does not directly challenge the @entity29 's landmark 1973 @entity94 decision affirming a woman 's right to an abortion , although he acknowledged it is a step in that direction			1
he has dismissed what he calls the " sky is falling " claims of his critics , saying all his bill does is grant legal recognition to the unborn prior to birth			2
" by itself , it does not outlaw abortion			2
it does n't address birth control , " he said			0
" this is a side show designed to distract people 's attention from what we 're doing here			0
" a bill similar to @entity3 's is pending in @entity119 's state legislature			2
voters in @entity121 and @entity122 have rejected " personhood " ballot initiatives in recent years			2
women 's rights advocates say these legislative and ballot efforts around the country to establish fetal personhood are part of a move to place greater restrictions on women 's access to abortion			1
" over the past several years , we 've seen more and more attempts to restrict abortion directly , " said @entity135 , state issues manager at the @entity136 , an organization that describes itself as advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights through research and policy analysis			1
" these efforts around redefining ' person ' are a little more of a back door approach , because they do n't use the term abortion			0
they 're not an outright abortion ban			0
instead they 're using a less obvious approach in a way that does not exactly indicate exactly how far they go			0
" according to the @entity136 , new laws in 24 states in 2011 restricted access to abortion services , while according to the advocacy group @entity157 , the number of " anti-choice " measures being implemented in states has risen steadily over the past decade , from 303 in 2001 to 713 in 2011			1
@entity157 cites measures that place limits on when and where a women can have an abortion , limit state aid or insurance coverage for the procedure , and mandate counseling			1
whether the @entity0 bill ultimately succeeds , politicians like @entity3 are committed to keeping the issue front and center			0
" i 've been here for 20 years , " he said			0
" that means i do n't quit			0
" his dedication is matched by those on the other side -- proof positive that 39 years after the @entity94 decision , the debate over women 's reproductive rights is not going away any time soon .			0

a measure giving rights to the unborn passes the @entity5
it still must pass the @entity60 , and the *governor* has yet to commit to signing it
similar measures are under *consideration* in other states
opponents say " personhood " legislation is a step toward outlawing abortion
