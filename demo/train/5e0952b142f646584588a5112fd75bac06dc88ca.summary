the 17 - time major champion dispatched his @entity14 opponent 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 1 in just 95 minutes and remains on course for a first ever @entity6 meeting with @entity17 in the quarterfinals			1
" i did n't know @entity17 was in my quarter -- i 'm kidding , " @entity3 said in an on court interview			2
" i am well aware of the draw , but at the moment i am clearly focusing on round by round and it would be a big mistake if i was thinking too much about @entity17			0

" i 'm definitely used to it , " @entity4 said of her schedule			2
" i usually play every day			0
in regular tournaments i do n't have a day off			0
only in the grand slams i get the luxury of having a day off			0
i guess i did n't get that			0
" definitely gives you more time to work on things you want to do in your next match , so that 's kind of more or less how i look at it , just as getting more time to be more ready			2
" @entity4 also lent her support to @entity72 's @entity71 , the fourth seed , who made a tearful exit from the tournament after being beaten in straight sets by compatriot @entity78			1
@entity71 said : " i 'm feeling too much pressure			0
i do n't know why , but i 'm not enjoying going on the courts , and that is the worst thing a player can have			0
" the 26 - year - old was runner up at the @entity85 in 2012 and reached the semis in @entity8 last year but @entity4 said the @entity72 should n't be so hard on herself			1
" it 's hard but i think she 's doing a good job , " @entity4 said			2
" i mean , sometimes you have a tough day at the office , and it does n't mean that you did n't handle the pressure well			0
i think she 's a good player			0
