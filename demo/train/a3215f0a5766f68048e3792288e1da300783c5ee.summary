-- president @entity1 is visiting my hometown of @entity4 -- the city i hate to love			1
the president 's visit focuses attention on gun violence , and comes soon after the funeral of @entity11 , the 15 - year - old who was shot down in @entity4 after participating in the president 's inauguration festivities			1
i know way too much about urban gun violence ; three people i love were shot and killed , like @entity17 , on @entity4 's streets			1
i grew up on the @entity19 in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s			1
i was very young , but i recall the evening of my dad 's death vividly			1
we had a green phone mounted on our kitchen wall			0
one night as my mom and i were sleeping in her bed , the phone rang			2
my mom awoke and went to the kitchen to answer			2
she leaned against the wall , that green phone in her hand , with a look of despair and horror as her sister - in - law told her the news			0
the @entity4 police then banged on the door , saying , " we just found your husband dead			1
" at that moment our lives changed			0
@entity4 's ruthless streets had stolen my father			1
@entity44 was shot and killed in a robbery , on his way home from church			1
he died four minutes away from the house where @entity1 grew up			1
and so my mother , @entity50 , was left to raise me in a single parent household			0
without her husband 's income , she struggled to keep me in private school and extra curricular activities -- from ballet , to tap , to flute lessons , to drum lessons			1
her sacrifice can never be repaid			0
she taught me how to be a survivor , and imparted strong values , standards and morals			0
@entity4 's record murder rate : do n't blame guns alone she also taught me the lesson of forgiveness			1
i forgive the two men and woman who killed my father because you ca n't go forward if you do n't			2
in high school , my great friend and honorary " big brother " died in the same street violence			2
@entity76 was intelligent , upstanding , funny and a good student			0
he was gunned down in a robbery on a summer day when he was home from his freshman year at college			0
he had gone to get his car washed			0
as a senior in high school , i vowed to get out of @entity4 , to escape the pain and tragedy			1
i worked hard and landed a full four year scholarship to @entity89			1
but in march of 2010 , @entity4 reached me in @entity90 with another horrifying phone call			2
my grade school buddy @entity92 -- kind , funny and generous -- was leaving his birthday party and was caught in the crossfire of two gangs			0
@entity92 was killed by a stray bullet and his killer was never captured			0
to add to the tragedy for his family , his older brother was a @entity4 police officer who was killed in the line of duty in august 2001			1
my hometown is a war zone			0
too many innocent children and young adults have died			0
@entity4 police reported that 506 people were murdered in the city in 2012 , about 16 % more than 2011			1
compare that with the fact that 310 @entity114 troops were killed in @entity115 in 2012			0
chicagoans can be proud and hopeful that our president is going to the city to bring attention to this epidemic of violence			1
too many mothers , fathers , sisters and brothers of murder victims have been suffering for too long			0
leaders like @entity4 police commissioner @entity129 and @entity4 mayor @entity130 need to figure out why murder rates in cities like @entity133 and @entity134 are plummeting while @entity4 's continues to soar			1
my view : how we talk about guns in my @entity4 classroom and parents , religious leaders , teachers and community organizers also need to help take back the streets			2
the city needs an action plan to save innocent people from becoming victims like @entity148 , @entity92 and @entity17			0
it needs more community centers to offer a safe haven and alternative to gang banging for kids			0
young people need direction and mentors -- people like my mother , who instilled in me the values you need to rise above the challenges of poverty and despair			0
i love @entity4 because it made me who i am			2
it has the best pizza , a great skyline , gorgeous @entity168 , museums and a diversity of cultures on every corner			0
it gave us @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity177 winning author @entity176 -- and the great @entity178			0
it gave us @entity1 , who was also raised on the @entity19			1
but it 's the city i hate to love , and i wo n't go back -- especially now that i 'm raising a son			2
i do n't want to lose him to the streets of @entity4			2
i hope president @entity1 's visit will inspire the city to save itself , so young people in the future will feel they can live and raise a family in the city they love			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2
