-- august 19 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : well , you 've made it to thursday			2
this is @entity0 ! your hearing : listen up , ' cause we 're gon na be talking about that in just a bit			2
we start off today , though , in @entity4			1
first up : @entity4 aid @entity25 : severe flooding has left 20 percent -- one fifth -- of the country underwater , and officials are worried about the threat of disease			1
a lot of the victims are walking through dirty flood waters , and that can lead to the spread of things like cholera or typhoid			1
experts are estimating that as many as 3.5 million children are at risk of getting sick			1
of course , the most immediate concern is aid : food , medical supplies			1
the @entity47 has asked for $ 460 million from the international community			2
only about half of that has been raised so far			2
@entity51 secretary of state @entity52 is expected to announce today that the @entity51 will be sending more aid to @entity4			1
@entity55 has more on the relief efforts			1
@entity57 , @entity0 correspondent : we 're here off the shores of @entity60 on the @entity61 with the @entity62			2
it is their whole mission to make sure to be available when there is some sort of disaster			2
they patrol these waters , and they were in the area to help those in the flood zones in @entity4			1
they 've been able to get about 5,000 people out of those flood zones , rescuing them with helicopters			1
they 've also been able to drop about a half million pounds of aid			1
they say they will be here for as long as it takes			2
there are more helicopters coming in ; there are more ships coming in			2
the @entity51 says that it has a humanitarian commitment that they 're going to make to @entity4			1
they 've already given about $ 90 million in kind			2
but the @entity47 continually saying that there is simply not enough aid being offered to this country			1
@entity5 strike @entity25 : more international news for you now , our next story taking us to @entity5 , the country that hosted the @entity100 this past summer			1
if you watched any of that , you saw huge crowds of people			2
and the nation 's streets are crowded again			1
this time , it 's with @entity5 workers who are on strike			1
people who work in the public sector -- hospital employees , teachers , federal workers -- walked off the job all across @entity5 yesterday			2
organizers have threatened that this strike will go on indefinitely			2
they want the government to give them more pay and better benefits			2
@entity5 officials say those demands just ca n't be met right now			2
they 're worried about the impact of this nationwide strike , though			2
they claim it could end up hurting the entire country , including the very people who are protesting			0
what 's the word @entity128 , @entity14 : what 's the word ? a man - made item from an older time period it 's an artifact			1
that 's the word ! @entity136 @entity25 : artifacts are n't always big or spectacular			1
sometimes simple items , like a button or fork , those can be important , too			0
they can offer clues about a culture , a civilization we did n't know much about before			0
in fact , some scientists think a huge collection of artifacts that was recently discovered in the state of @entity6 could offer clues about what life was like in a @entity136 prison camp			1
@entity156 : if you have n't heard of that , you 're not alone			0
it 's not very well known because it was only open for six weeks			1
but recently , a group of college students found it , and they found hundreds of artifacts from prisoners there			1
buttons , bullets , coins , a pipe			0
some of these artifacts will go on display soon			1
and the reason why experts think this finding is so significant is that the site barely seems to have been touched			1
a lot of @entity136 sites get torn up by people hunting for relics ; not so at @entity156			1
is this legit ? @entity179 , @entity14 : is this legit ? your ear is part of your olfactory system			0
not legit ! it 's part of your auditory system , your sense of hearing			1
hearing loss study @entity25 : well , that sense may be getting worse , especially for you all			0
and as somebody who played the drums in middle and high school , i sympathize with you			0
there 's a new study out about 12 to 19 year olds			1
it found that the number of teens who suffer from early signs of hearing loss is going up dramatically			0
we want you to look at these statistics ; they 're pretty surprising			0
back in 1994 , around one in every 20 teens had some kind of hearing loss			0
by 2006 , that number was up to one in every 5			0
that means about 6.5 million teens experience hearing loss			0
so the next question is , why ? what is causing this increase ? researchers say that 's what they need to focus on in the future			1
one of the authors of this study , though , was asked if technology might be part of the reason			0
@entity225 , @entity226 : is it the @entity228 ? from our study , in specific , it is actually -- we can not say what the cause is of this increase from our data			0
of course , the world around us is getting louder			0
you can stand in a busy intersection in @entity239 , for example , and get sound levels that are dangerously high if you are exposed to it for a prolonged period of time			0
you can also get it from driving in a convertible on the highway			0
and so , of course , teenagers are using headphones and are using portable music devices now that they have not been using previously			0
and so , that 's certainly one possibility			1
@entity256 rising @entity25 : five years ago this month , @entity257 slammed into @entity51 's @entity259 region			1
" @entity264 " -- a new @entity0 documentary -- tells the story of one neighborhood 's struggle to rebuild after the storm			1
the program airs on @entity0 this saturday and sunday at 8 p.m. @entity266			0
and @entity0 has put together a teacher and parent guide to go along with the show			0
you can find them in the @entity272 section at @entity273			1
@entity274 @entity25 : when the power goes out , a lot of times it 's because of that huge lightning storm outside your window			1
if lightning hits a power line , you 're in the dark			1
but there are times when it seems like blackouts happen when there is n't a single cloud in sight			0
@entity291 sheds some light on why some of us could see more days in the dark			1
( begin video ) @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity239 : sizzling temperatures as much of a strain on the power system as on the public			0
why does the power system always strain when the temperature soars ? it 's our electricity grid system , which was not designed for today 's demands			1
@entity308 , a former chief executive of two power companies , warns that the system is at risk			0
@entity312 , energy expert : we are nowhere near where we have absolute certainty that we can avoid a major outage or a disturbance			0
it 's not that it will happen every day , but indeed a strong possibility that that could occur			1
@entity320 : when the heat is on and air conditioners are on full blast to fight it , power demand can overburden circuits and transformers that allow electricity to travel from power plants across transmission lines and into your home			1
@entity332 , @entity333 : the circuits and the transformers , they do n't have the time to cool down , so they get overloaded			0
an overloaded circuit could cause an outage			0
@entity320 : president @entity340 , aware of the problem , last year committed $ 3.5 billion in stimulus money to modernize the grid			0
but it is only about two percent of what the power industry would have to invest for a smart grid			0
and much of the government money has yet to be spent			0
@entity239 's @entity349 recently put off a plan to install smart grid equipment in part of @entity353			2
it 's a disappointment to a @entity356 company that supplies high capacity power cables , superconductors that can protect against dangerous power surges			2
@entity360 , @entity361 : superconductors are a key component of those smart grids in @entity365 , in @entity366			0
and here in the @entity51 , we need to do the same thing , and we urgently need to update our grid			1
@entity320 : smart grid technology would allow utilities to see precise , real - time demand from every customer , so they could take action to minimize the risk of an outage			2
but most power companies have only just begun such an upgrade			0
in fact , the @entity380 says that two regions are especially vulnerable : @entity383 , suffering from drought conditions that are reducing power output from the @entity387 power plant ; and south central @entity388 , where transmission lines need upgrades to improve reliability			0
( @entity392 ) before we go @entity25 : and finally today , we 're gon na go ahead and call in the b - team			1
yes , that is a pun			0
all 50,000 members of the b - team			2
you know they work well together ; you 've had honey before			0
this time , they teamed up to trap a police officer inside his car for 3 hours ! officer is totally fine			0
but can you imagine being trapped in your car by bees in the summer heat ? you know that 's got ta be swarm			1
eventually , some experts came out to box up the bees and free the deputy			2
goodbye @entity25 : which put an end to this arresting development			0
@entity417 - sting : that 's a two - for - one ! you ca n't beee - at that			1
next time , they should just call out the swat unit ! okay , we 'll buzz off			0
but just ' til tomorrow			0
if you watched @entity0 last year , you know that fridays are awesome			0
we will see you then			0
thanks for joining us .			0
