-- @entity1 covers 60 percent of @entity2 , yet this developing country is among the world 's highest carbon emitters			1
the reason : it has one of the world 's fastest rates of deforestation , mainly for palm oil production			1
as trees are felled , the carbon stored in them and the soil is released into the atmosphere			2
the @entity17 estimated that between 2003 and 2006 , deforestation and forest degradation reached 1.17 million hectares per year			1
@entity20 , a leading climate scientist , in @entity2 to measure carbon emissions through deforestation , illustrated the problem			1
" around us here we have a very young oil palm plantation and around the oil palms you can see the stumps of the trees , this area was probably logged between three and five years ago , " he said			2
" we 're trying to understand how this change from forest through degradation to oil palm affects the emission of greenhouse gases			2
" but there is a solution , in the form of the @entity17 program reducing emissions from @entity41 ( @entity42 , which has @entity2 as one of its pilot countries			1
through @entity42 , @entity46 has pledged to give @entity2 up to one billion dollars if it can prove a reduction in its emissions and halt deforestation			1
as part of its new commitments , in january 2011 @entity2 begins a two - year ban on any new clearing of forests			1
@entity55 , @entity56 on @entity57 , @entity2 , said : " if you are living in area where there are no other economic activities you are bound to cut the trees			1
" but if there are other economic activities which will be created by this financial assistance then the local communities , the local companies and the local governments will be able to continue their economic development activities without damaging the forests			2
" however , there is one group that has yet to be convinced , and that is @entity2 's indigenous population			1
@entity76 , a spokesman for the @entity78 people , whose forest homeland has all but disappeared and who are now living in a state - controlled park , said : " the forest is very important for the @entity78			2
we 're born in the forest			2
the huge woods are our home			0
" we want the government to provide us with a reserve area so we can manage the land by ourselves and not break government regulations			0
" @entity91 , of @entity92 , the @entity93 , added : " indigenous peoples in @entity2 have experienced massive encroachment of their land and territories			1
" when their territories change into something else that they do n't understand like oil palm plantations it really has a big impact on their livelihoods			0
" for us forests belong to us because they are in our territories			2
we existed before @entity2 exists , before our country exists			1
" @entity55 knows he must win over these objections if the ban on deforestation is to be a success			1
he said : " what i say to them is let 's give this initiative the benefit of the doubt			0
if they just want to sit back and protest we will only be able to deliver partial success			0
" we can build both economic benefits to local people today , while preserving the livelihood with the same high quality of life for future generations			0
we could really make this breakthrough a reality			0
" @entity20 , too , is optimistic the policy can be a success			0
he is trying to measure the emissions caused by a change from forest to palm oil plantations to give solid data on @entity2 's carbon emissions			1
" i think we 're at a turning point , " said @entity20			0
" a lot has changed but we 're not quite there yet			0
" scientifically , technically we can do this -- there 's not a problem that resources and a little bit of time ca n't solve			0
but there are problems i think that require still more changes in political will to push us over the finish line			0
" @entity55 added : " it should be a no - brainer for decision - makers of the world to choose working on reducing emissions in @entity2 , because it delivers three things instead of one : it reduces emissions ; it alleviates poverty and it conserves biological diversity			1
" why is it so difficult ? let 's make it happen			0
