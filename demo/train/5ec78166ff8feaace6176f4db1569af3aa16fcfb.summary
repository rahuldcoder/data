-- when congressman @entity2 opined recently that there was a " real culture problem " in poor communities , " in our inner cities in particular , " and that this culture was behind some of the country 's economic troubles , he did n't realize how half right he was			1
people are continuing to debate fiercely what @entity2 said and whether he meant to propagate racially coded explanations of poverty 's roots			1
but put that aside for a moment			0
here 's what he was right about : there is indeed a culture in @entity23 that is pathological and now threatens our social fabric			1
it 's not the culture of poverty , though			1
it 's the culture of wealth			1
we live in an age of extreme concentration of wealth in @entity23			1
the problem is not just that the 1 % have managed to nearly triple their share of national income in the last three decades			2
nor is it just that the 1 % increasingly are fed , schooled and housed in a bubble apart from the rest of their fellow citizens			0
the problem is that today 's concentration of wealth is breaking the golden link that @entity2 and others take pains to emphasize -- the link between work and reward			1
economist @entity55 's landmark new book " capital " unpacks this delinking in great statistical detail			0
it turns out that increasing numbers of @entity23 in the 1 % , .1 % and .01 % have done little to " earn " their wealth or privilege			1
contrary to myth , most of today 's plutocrats are not the kind of @entity66 visionary risk - taking entrepreneurs or superstar celebrities			0
the .01 % , for instance , tend overwhelmingly to be high - end corporate managers and executives , particularly on @entity71 , operating in interlocking networks that inflate the standard of what an executive is " worth			0
" or they are the heirs of the great entrepreneurs ( 4 of the 10 richest @entity23 are children of @entity79 ) , inheritors of fortunes of which it can truly be said , " someone else built that			1
" an aristocracy is emerging in @entity23 , a class of insiders that corrodes the promise of equal citizenship			2
and with this compounding of unearned advantage , certain antisocial values and behaviors have taken root among the superrich -- norms that threaten to corrupt the rest of @entity23 society			1
what 's in this dysfunctional culture of concentrated wealth ? look around @entity71			1
you 'll find tribal insularity , short - term thinking , personal irresponsibility , cynicism about playing by the rules , an aversion to socially productive labor , a habit of shameless materialism , an inability to defer gratification and a lack of concern for what " message " all this sends to the youth raised in such an environment			0
in short , you 'll find the very things typically imputed to the culture of poverty			2
now , to be sure , there are poor people who do exhibit these antisocial values and norms			1
and there is no question that plenty of poor people are poor because they made bad choices and behaved in self - destructive ways			0
but rich people who exhibit such values have something the poor do n't : @entity136			2
money buys exemption from bad choices			0
money confers power -- in particular , over the poor			0
it confers the power to frame public narrative and policymaking and to determine whose behavior -- whose culture -- is ( and is n't ) called pathological			2
today , as it was during the last @entity151 , the concentration of wealth gives the rich the political clout to further concentrate their wealth			1
( and now , as then , the @entity155 greases the skids in the name of " liberty " )			0
this clout is wielded in plain sight now , without any pretense of civic equality			0
and it calls to mind the warning attributed to justice @entity165 : " we may have democracy , or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few , but we ca n't have both			2
" when the richest 400 families in @entity23 have more wealth than the bottom 155 million @entity23 combined , the danger to the republic is far more clear and present than that posed by the " welfare queens " of lore or by anecdotes of shiftless inner - city men			1
that would be true even if the super-rich today had entirely benign or merely neutral policy preferences			0
but in fact they 've rigged the game of policy , subsidies and tax preferences to amplify and hoard their gains			1
this is n't to suggest that all super-wealthy people are " welfare kings " ( they 're not ) or to imply that they have a monopoly on selfishness or sociopathic attitudes ( they do n't )			0
yet if it 's unfair to paint everyone in the 1 % with the same unflattering brush of " dysfunctional culture , " is n't it far worse to do the same to the poorest 20 % ? wealth and advantage are as strongly self - reinforcing as poverty and disadvantage			1
it 's possible to recognize this fact while also championing grit , gumption and good values			2
in fact , it 's essential			0
but culture does n't explain everything			2
and where it matters is n't only among the poor or nonwhite			0
if we 're going to reform the norms in this country so that opportunity is truly reflective of effort and talent , we have to do more than pick on those with the least			0
we have to start at the top .			0
