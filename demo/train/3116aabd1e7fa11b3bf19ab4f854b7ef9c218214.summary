in 1990 , a 25 - year - old researcher for @entity1 , stuck on a train stopped on the tracks between @entity4 and @entity5 , stared out the window for hours			2
to those around her , no doubt rustling newspapers and magazines , busily rifling through work , the young woman no doubt appeared to be little more than a space cadet , wasting her time , zoning out			1
but that woman came to be known as @entity14			1
and in those idle hours daydreaming out the train window , she has said that the entire plot of the magical @entity18 simply " fell into " her head			1
@entity20 , during an enormously productive summer of writing in 1874 , spent entire days daydreaming in the shade of @entity22 in @entity23 , letting his mind wander , thinking about everything and nothing at all , and , in the end , publishing " @entity28			1
" such creative breakthroughs in leisurely moments are hardly unique to literature			1
physicist @entity32 idly watched students in the cafeteria goof off by spinning plates			2
for the fun of it , he began to make calculations of the wobbles			2
that " piddling around , " as he called it , led to developing the @entity40 to explain quantum electrodynamics , which resulted in a @entity42			0
legend has it not only that @entity46 had his " eureka ! " moment about water displacement while relaxing in the tub , but that @entity51 worked out the @entity52 while tootling around on his bicycle			0
though protestant work ethic - driven @entity56 have tended to worry about the devil holding sway in idle time , it turns out idle time is crucial for creativity , innovation and breakthrough thinking			1
and now we know why			0
neuroscience is finding that when we are idle , our brains are most active			1
it all has to do with something called the brain 's default mode network , explains @entity72 , a human factors research scientist and author of the new book , " @entity76 , the @entity77 of doing nothing			0
" the default mode network is like a series of airport hubs in different and typically unconnected parts of the brain			0
and that 's why it 's so crucial			0
when the brain flips into idle mode , this network subconsciously puts together stray thoughts , makes seemingly random connections and enables us to see an old problem in an entirely new light			1
using brain scans , psychologists @entity94 and @entity96 have found that just before that moment of insight , the brain turns inward , what they call a " brain blink , " and lights up an area believed to be linked to our ability to understand the poetry of metaphors			0
a positive mood and taking time to relax , they found , were critical precursors to these a-ha ! moments			1
that 's not to say that being idle all the time is the answer			1
sir @entity116 was steeped in the study of physical science when he sat in his garden in a " contemplative mood , " idly sipping tea after dinner one evening , noticed an apple fall straight to the ground , and came up with the @entity125			1
" to be most creative , you need this oscillation between deep study with focused attention and daydreaming , which is why you may have your great ideas when you 're in the shower , " @entity72 told me			1
" they can come into your consciousness when you 're not busy			0
" smart himself typically takes long , leisurely walks during the workday and carries a notebook with him to capture any interesting thoughts or ideas that his default mode network may burble to the surface			0
most employers frown on such behavior			0
but if they 're smart , they would n't			0
one recent study of the pharmaceutical industry by @entity155 of the @entity156 in @entity157 and @entity158 , former dean of research at @entity160 , for example , found that , despite massive research and development budgets , the number of potential breakthrough drugs introduced in the past decade has dropped roughly in half			0
why ? because companies became obsessed with cautious efficiency , they argue , rather than in often risky , dreamy innovation			0
" companies pressure workers to be in the office , to work all the time			1
but at the same time , they 're really interested in innovation , which comes from letting go , " @entity72 said			1
" but you ca n't have it both ways			0
the @entity175 closed up their busy bicycle shop in @entity177 , decamped to the beach in @entity179 and in this playful , leisure time , invented the airplane			1
@entity182 escapes to a cabin in the woods for " think weeks			0
" @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 give employees some version of " 20 percent time " -- affectionately known as " employee goof off time			2
" and giving workers time to daydream , experiment and follow a passion without worrying about failure has resulted in some of their most innovative and successful products , such as @entity198 and @entity199 , an advertising program that @entity201 reports now produces about a quarter of @entity186 's revenue hard as it is to believe in our modern , work - worshipping culture , idleness , leisure time , daydreaming and time away from the hurly - burly , the drudgery of routine and the endless nose to the grindstone , is not only essential for innovation , it is , in fact , what has created civilization			1
art , literature , inventions , innovation , philosophy -- one could argue nearly all that is transcendent about our flawed human species -- has come as a result of a delicate balance between the uninterrupted time in leisure to daydream , to set the default mode network free , and the concentrated time at work to make those flights of whim and fancy something real			1
philosopher @entity234 , in his famous 1932 essay , " in praise of @entity239 , " advocated a four - hour workday and more leisure time for all			2
daydreaming , imaging the possibility of a better world in leisure time , he argued , not only cultivated arts , science and culture , but liberated the oppressed and birthed new , democratic systems of governance			2
without leisure , he wrote , " mankind would never have emerged from barbarism			0
" it 's a crucial truth that is increasingly getting lost as our work hours climb			2
workers in the @entity56 put in among the most extreme hours of any advanced economy on the planet -- as economic uncertainty and fear of the future keep us firmly planted at our desks , the better to show the boss what good workers we are in advance of the next round of downsizing			0
our antiquated laws give no overwork protection to knowledge workers , and as advances in technology , as much as they are designed to free us , keep us instead tethered to the office , checking texts and e-mails , returning work calls everywhere and all the time , leaving us feeling perpetually " on call " and never quite able to get away from it all			1
work , and this insidious work creep says leisure scholar @entity278 , is now how @entity56 tend to answer the existential questions of who we are and how we find meaning in life			2
and in so doing , we have created a world that has no time for something as seemingly silly and unproductive as daydreaming and leisure time			2
and that 's where we 're wrong			0
just imagine , what if , instead of staring out the window , that @entity1 researcher stuck on a train dove into a thick ream of cases to catch up on ? or , if it were today , whipped out her smartphone and tackled the backlog of e-mails in her inbox , diverting herself occasionally with a game of @entity300 ? or would we all have been too busy to stop and notice just how much smaller the world is without magic ?			0

@entity304 : take breaks from your work and use the time to daydream
from @entity116 to @entity20 to @entity14 , creative thinkers have productively used idleness
neuroscience finds brains are especially active when we are idle , she says
