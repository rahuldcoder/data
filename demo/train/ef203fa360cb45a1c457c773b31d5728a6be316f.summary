-- a recent study on global wellbeing showed the @entity3 to be the happiest people on the planet and with about a fifth of them living in their capital it stands to reason that @entity8 must be a little bit special			1
the @entity10 palaces are the royal family 's winter residence			0
so what are they so happy about ? well , lifestyle magazine @entity15 recently named @entity8 as being the world 's most livable city , highlighting the quality of its infrastructure , transport system and contemporary buildings			1
it 's true that the city is well planned and well managed ; it boasts a new metro system , the main arteries in the centre are pedestrianized and the other streets are filled with cyclists rather than exhaust fumes			0
but @entity8 is not some soulless exercise in sterile urban planning			0
there are the winding medieval streets of @entity35 and the @entity36 , the picture - postcard houses of @entity38 , the canals of @entity40 , and the palaces and parks of @entity43 and @entity44			1
the city is , simply , charming			0
if you spend some time in @entity8 you 'll quickly come to understand the @entity3 concept of " hygge " , a word with multiple meanings that is best translated as something between " cozy " and " relaxed "			2
but if that suggests a city of bygone cuteness it does n't take into account the sleek modernism of @entity3 design			1
@entity60 's legacy can be seen throughout the city ( check out the @entity62 and @entity63 ) but no less visionary are recent structures such as @entity67 's futuristic @entity66 or the dramatic new @entity68 , known as the " @entity69 "			0
the clean lines and minimalism that characterize @entity3 design are evident in the interiors of the city 's stylish bars , restaurants and hotels and perhaps their influence can even be detected in the trend away from bland , stodgy cooking to a cleaner , healthier style that is earning the city 's restaurants acclaim and @entity85 stars			1
the alternative side of @entity8 can be seen in places like @entity88 , the ' free city ' founded in 1971 by a collection of dropouts , hippies and social visionaries			1
the fact that this semi-autonomous experiment in communal living has survived for so long is testament to the open - mindedness of the @entity3 ; but the very existence of @entity88 has always been controversial and government plans to ' normalize ' the area suggest it may not be ' free ' much longer			1
like any city of its size , @entity8 has its share of social problems			0
@entity105 has been the scene of a riots in recent years , with some commentators blaming social deprivation and others blaming boredom among young people			0
but it is working class areas like @entity105 and @entity114 , away from the tourist trail , that are the beating heart of the city			0
they are home to many of @entity8 's trendiest bars and clubs and they have a sense of community that is difficult to convey ; it is something @entity3 might describe as " hygge "			2
so why are the @entity3 so happy ? go to @entity8 and you 'll understand .			2

@entity8 has been described as the world 's most livable city
the city is charming , with medieval streets , canals and royal palaces
sleek @entity3 design is evident everywhere and gives the city a modern edge
the ' free city ' of @entity88 is *testimony* to @entity3 open - mindedness
