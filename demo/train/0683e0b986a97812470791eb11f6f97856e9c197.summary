at the start of 2014 even @entity1 's most devoted fans would scarcely have believed he would end it within touching distance of the coveted world no. 1 ranking			1
forget the anticlimax of his withdrawal from the title match against @entity9 at the @entity10 , he had shown enough in the tournament to suggest the old @entity1 magic was back			1
a straight sets near " double bagel " of @entity15 in the group matches -- not to mention his saving of four match points in his epic semifinal against fellow @entity21 @entity20 -- was proof positive of the 33 - year - old 's renaissance			2
he also beat world @entity25 on the way to winning the masters 1000 event in @entity29 and claimed his fifth title of the year in his hometown event in @entity32 , the perfect buildup to the year - end showpiece in @entity35			2
@entity1 told @entity3 that his performances in 2013 , when he slipped down the rankings to seventh as a result of injury and a loss of form , had left even him with doubts he could return to his best			1
" things were difficult mid-year last year , " said the 17 - time grand slam winner			1
" it was a hard year , a long year			0
i had to put in a lot of effort mentally and physically to get back in shape and find the right solution , how i was going to get back			0
" @entity1 parted company with his coach of three years @entity54 in his quest to rediscover his best form and replaced him with former grand slam legend @entity57			1
not only that , he switched to a much bigger framed racket -- something of a gamble so late in his career			0
but with the year only a few days old , @entity1 reached the final of the @entity64 , losing to @entity65 , and the semifinals at the @entity67 where he was beaten by his old rival @entity68			1
" this year , everything has been really good			0
right at the beginning of the year , in @entity71 , " recalled @entity1			1
" i played very well in @entity72 and in @entity73			0
" that was actually quite a surprise for me , because i thought it was going to take until march or april until i was going to find my best game			0
" but it came earlier and in the process , i was able to move up the rankings quicker , " he revealed			0
that progression quickened with titles in @entity83 and @entity84 , backed up by reaching the final of masters 1000 events in @entity87 and @entity88			2
it left @entity1 in fine fettle as he headed into his beloved @entity91 and with a real prospect of adding to his record number of grand slam singles titles			1
impressive play saw him reach his 25th grand slam final , but @entity9 stood in his way			1
it was an epic encounter , @entity1 so close to causing an upset in a five - set final , but he can now reflect with pride on his achievement			1
" i think @entity91 was definitely a highlight -- getting to the final and getting as close as i did to @entity9 , " he believes			1
" that , to me , cemented that i was literally back -- back maybe where i belong and back where i wanted to be			0
" @entity1 also looked set for more grand slam glory at the @entity106 , until he was surprisingly beaten by eventual winner @entity107			2
a lesser player might have suffered an adverse reaction to that defeat , but @entity1 was undaunted and has shown improved form in the closing months of the year			1
" i 've been able to really shift gears -- and i 've had a great finish to the season so far , " he said			0
" and the next thing you know , i 'm playing for world @entity117 , which i quite honestly ca n't believe			0
" @entity1 's hopes of the top ranking were ended when @entity9 beat @entity121 in group play at the @entity10 , but he still has one further milestone to contemplate			1
paired with @entity67 champion @entity20 , @entity1 has lifted @entity21 into the final of the @entity125 for the first time			1
@entity127 will provide the opposition in @entity129 from friday , with @entity1 hoping the minor back problem he sustained -- ironically in beating @entity20 in a three - set epic at the @entity10 -- will clear up in time			2
a @entity21 triumph would cap a remarkable year for @entity1 , who is already looking towards 2015			1
with @entity68 sidelined by injury and illness and @entity15 unable to match his heroics of 2012 and 2013 , the way looks clear for the current top two to dominate			0
but @entity1 is also wary of the new wave of talent that made their mark this year			1
" we definitely have the next wave of generation coming through , " he considers			0
" with @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity107 , @entity149 -- there 's a few guys there			0
the younger guys are pushing up as well -- the guys between 17 and 21 , right now			0
" i think we 'll see some big challenges coming from that generation in the next two years			0
" @entity1 is particularly impressed by @entity147 , who beat @entity9 in the semifinals of the @entity106 and pushed him hard in the semifinals in @entity35 last week			1
" i 've known @entity147 since he was 17 years old , and i 've always been impressed by how he carries himself , how he handles pressure , how well he can play and how talented he is , " said @entity1 of the @entity157 rising star			2
" so i think for @entity161 , it 's a big deal , a big win , because we have n't had a great @entity161 player in some time now			0
" @entity1 is also optimistic about the future of his sport as heads into the autumn of his remarkable career			2
" i think the tennis tour is doing very well , record numbers in attendance , and facilities being upgraded as we speak , so i think it 's really , really good times for tennis right now			0
" when @entity1 does decide to hang up his racket the @entity177 will lose its star attraction			2
but , based on his 2014 appearances , that moment is still some way off .			0

@entity1 reflects on a triumphant 2014
@entity185 in the rankings behind @entity9
highlight for @entity1 was reaching final at @entity91
surprised to find his form so early in the year after ' difficult ' 2013
