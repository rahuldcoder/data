-- as @entity1 hurtles toward a government shutdown , the go - to move for the uninformed is to blame both sides equally			1
just say , " a pox on both their houses , " and you can get through any neighborhood barbecue or tv talk show			2
but what if you really want to know what 's happening ? there are three metrics you should track if you want to know who will come out ahead in a government shutdown : which side is more united ? one of president @entity21 's laws of politics is : " democrats want to fall in love , @entity18 just want to fall in line			1
" which is what makes the @entity18 fratricide so interesting			2
savaging your colleagues , undermining your leaders , backbiting and backstabbing -- these are usually @entity34 specialties			2
credit the strong leadership of @entity37 @entity36 and @entity39 majority leader @entity38 with keeping a remarkably diverse @entity34 @entity40 together			1
when you can keep a strong conservative like sen. @entity42 of @entity43 on the same page with the powerfully progressive rep. @entity45 of @entity46 , you are definitely winning			1
meanwhile , the @entity18 , whose members range from conservative to ultraconservative , is at war with itself and its leaders			0
sen. @entity52 of @entity53 led the fight on the @entity39 floor to block consideration of the funding bill			0
but after a pointless 21 - hour talkathon , the majority of his @entity18 colleagues rejected @entity52 's strategy			1
@entity39 @entity18 split badly and bitterly ; 25 voted against @entity52 while just 19 voted with him			0
in the @entity63 , it is chaos			0
the @entity65 are fighting the @entity66 and the @entity67 tough guys are fighting the australopithecines			0
which side is more mainstream ? a majority of voters do n't like the @entity73 -- although that 's a bit misleading , because a percentage of them dislike it because they think it does n't go far enough			1
i like it -- in fact , i love it -- but that 's not the point of this column			2
@entity73 clocks in at just 29 % support in a recent @entity87 poll			1
so you 'd think that the @entity18 ' position of repealing the @entity73 would be more mainstream			1
but you 'd be wrong			0
that same @entity87 poll shows that @entity92 oppose defunding @entity73 , with only a little more than one - third of voters saying they want it defunded			1
they want to mend it , not end it			0
what 's worse for the @entity18 , when the question shifts to whether you support shutting down the government and / or defaulting on @entity92 debt in order to kill @entity73 , the @entity18 position loses by a crushing 59 to 19 percentage points			1
when you 're down to just 19 % of your countrymen and - women supporting your crusade , it 's time ( as we say in @entity53 ) to pee on the fire and call the dogs : the hunt 's over			2
that is , no doubt , why the @entity63 @entity18 have retreated to their new position : delaying @entity73 for a year rather than outright defunding it			1
but health care delayed is health care denied , and it 's a bit of a reach to demand a one - year delay in the president 's top domestic priority in exchange for funding the government for 10 weeks			1
which side is more reasonable ? it is hard to seem reasonable when you are pursuing a strategy that even conservative republicans like sen. @entity131 called " the dumbest idea i 've ever heard of			2
" keep in mind this is from a man who represents @entity136 , where the @entity18 proposed a law barring federal courts from interpreting the @entity139 , and allowing the @entity140 to declare a state religion			0
( which might have passed had they chosen the right religion for the @entity136 : college basketball			0
) and yet there is hope for the @entity18 here			0
every time the president says " i will not negotiate on the debt ceiling " -- a phrase he utters even more often than " just pass me the ball , @entity153 , i 'm open ! " -- he risks looking unreasonable			0
as a matter of substance , i strongly agree with his position			0
but as a matter of rhetoric and positioning , he would be better served to state his position this way : " i will gladly listen to any idea to improve the @entity73 , or reduce the deficit , or any other ideas my @entity18 friends might have			1
but first we have to avoid default			2
that means paying the bills that @entity40 has already incurred			0
once we 've done that we can negotiate on anything			0
" same substantive position : negotiations on policy come only after the nation avoids default			2
but this formulation emphasizes the president 's willingness to be flexible on improving the @entity73 and other @entity180 priorities			1
of course , nothing is certain in life			0
but if i were a betting man , i 'd bet on president @entity180 and the @entity34 in this fight			1
as long as @entity18 appear more divided , more extreme and more unreasonable , they are going to lose			0
and then they will look weak as well			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

@entity188 asks which party is more united , mainstream and reasonable
@entity188 says that 's the way to see who 's winning shutdown , and democrats win
he says majority of @entity92 voters do n't want to shut down the goverment over @entity73
@entity202 : @entity180 should insist avoiding default is first priority before negotiating
