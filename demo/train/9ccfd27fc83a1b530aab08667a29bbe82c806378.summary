-- you may not even know such a kingdom exists , but it already has a king			0
@entity4 , known to his fans simply as @entity4 , is the self - proclaimed king of bachata , and though he remains relatively unknown to the @entity8 - speaking world , he is poised to take the music world by storm with his unique bachata fusion			1
@entity12 , which originated in the @entity14 , is music that predominantly speaks of heartbreak and sadness			1
the sound is a danceable track heavy on guitar and percussion			1
with his sultry voice , soulful lyrics and way of mixing the traditional island rhythm with more current hip - hop and @entity27 beats , @entity4 is considered a pioneer of the genre , nearly single - handedly making it a mainstream success			1
@entity4 began his career as lead singer of the group @entity35 in the mid- 1990s but has since ventured on his own			1
he just released " @entity36 , " the sequel to his hugely successful first solo album , 2011 's " @entity39			1
" while " @entity39 " included vocals from the likes of @entity42 and @entity43 , " @entity36 " expands on these collaborations			0
" when i was doing ' @entity45 , ' i had so many ideas that i knew one album was not going to be enough			2
in this album , i 'm offering a fusion of bachata with different genres : @entity53 reggae , @entity55 type of reggae and dance hall , " @entity4 said			1
the new album features duos with @entity60 , @entity61 , as well as @entity62 and @entity63 , both of whom offer vocals in @entity67			2
" it 's actually great for both of us , for the artist and for myself , because they 're also trying to do something unique and different , and these types of collaborations allow that , " @entity4 said			1
the album has already released various singles that have quickly climbed to the top of the charts			1
" @entity84 , " the track that features @entity62 , has become @entity4 ' eighth no. 1 hit on @entity83 's @entity82 @entity81 chart			1
the track also debuted at no. 45 on the @entity86 , the highest - charting debut for a @entity67 language song in the chart 's 55 - year history			0
@entity4 also recently announced that he will become the first @entity92 solo artist to headline a concert at @entity96 's @entity95 , and the first @entity92 act to perform at the iconic stadium since the @entity99 in 1973			1
" i understand the big responsibility , and i 'm honored , " @entity4 said at a news conference at the stadium to announce the performance			1
" i grew up in this neighborhood , near @entity95 , and i would walk around with my cousin and we were just trying to buy tickets to see a baseball game			1
i never even imagined that i would be performing , and to just make it to this point in my career as a solo artist is just extremely wonderful , and i 'm just like , wow , this is crazy			2
" it is a big - scale concert planned to meet the ever - growing demand for tickets to his shows			0
that 's definitely a long way to come for the @entity122 - born @entity14 / @entity121 singer who says he found most of his musical influences on the streets of his old neighborhood			2
" i grew up listening to bachata , to some of the greats of the genre			2
but it was very natural for me to create this type of fusion and to incorporate new beats , " he said			0
" i was born and raised in the @entity122 , and growing up here , you would go down the block , and on one corner you would hear bachata , on another corner some salsa , and of course there was hip - hop and r&b all over the place			0
so for me , it is very organic to have these combinations			0
" crossover , however , is not a term @entity4 is comfortable with			2
while both solo albums include @entity8 language tracks , he says bachata and @entity67 are his strong suits , and rather than making an all - @entity8 album , @entity4 said he encourages the @entity8 - speaking audience to cross over , too -- into his world			1
" i 'm a bachatero for the most part ; that 's what i want to do			0
i offer one or two @entity8 language tracks on this album , but ' @entity163 ' is always bachata , " he said			2
" when i reached out to these artists and said , ' look would you consider singing with me , you do n't have to sing in @entity67 , but you know it 's a @entity67 record , ' they accepted right away			0
and i have to say , it was actually @entity62 's idea to sing in @entity67			0
" @entity4 also happens to be a major heartthrob			2
he has amassed a huge fan base , mostly of women who swoon over his suave , romantic vocals , which , in traditional bachata style , speak of love lost and gained			0
but , he said , it was n't always that way			0
" growing up , i was n't the best - looking kid , and you know , i personally do n't feel like a sex symbol			0
i think the girls like me because i 'm very passionate , and i 'm very romantic with my lyrics , " he said , laughing , " i 'm not saying i 'm the ugliest guy in the planet , but i am definitely no model			0
" whatever the formula , it has been successful , something @entity4 credits to his upbringing			1
" having great parents has a lot to do with the success			0
anyone can achieve anything they want if they are just disciplined , if they have ethics , and then just try to reinvent yourself			0
@entity203 plays a big factor in anyone 's career			0
" are music fans ready for @entity4 ' original view of the world ? the odds look good .			1
