-- @entity1 confirmed tuesday evening that its microblogging site has been shuttered by @entity4 authorities			1
this came hours after widespread reports that access had been cut off , as @entity4 took to the streets in what many hope and some fear would be a sequel to the revolution in @entity14 last week			1
the day 's speculation that the @entity17 administration might have pulled the plug on @entity1 underscored the power of the site and other social networks as tools to both coordinate and disperse news of a citizen uprising			1
@entity1 , @entity25 and @entity26 were widely used in @entity14 's recent uprising and in @entity28 last year			1
but it remains an open and hotly debated question about how much of a role these tools actually play in real - world social movements , with some critics rightly pointing out that it becomes tempting for analysts to give more credit to the new and sexy tools than they actually deserve			0
" we can confirm that @entity1 was blocked in @entity4 around 8 a.m. pt today			1
it is impacting both @entity1 @ applications , " the company tweeted from the handle @ twitterglobalpr			2

in a separate tweet , @entity47 - based @entity1 added , " the experts are those using @entity1 on the ground and those coordinating with them around the world			0
" one of the leading authorities on @entity55 censorship , who is based in @entity57 , said in a telephone interview that his @entity25 account was accessible but not his @entity1 account			1
his @entity63 , he said , is @entity64 , that nation 's largest internet service provider			0
the source , who requested anonymity for fear of retribution , said some @entity4 using the @entity63 were getting access to @entity1			2
" @entity1 , it 's almost across - the - board inaccessible in @entity4 , " he said			1
" given the size of the crowds we saw in the streets , i would n't be surprised the outage was from the government			0
there 's been calls to censor the internet here for ages			0
" @entity85 reported from @entity57 that @entity1 was down and that as many as three people were killed as tens of thousands of protesters hit the streets demanding president @entity17 's 30 - year reign come to an end			1
@entity93 , using the handle @ @entity92 , had tweeted " no blocking from our side ! " it speculated that the outage may have been from " overload			0
" @entity99 , who compiles a crowd - sourced ledger of unavailable websites across the globe for the @entity104 at @entity105 , said the center had received about a dozen reports of @entity1 being inaccessible inside @entity4			2
" we can not confirm for sure if twitter.com is blocked , " she said in a telephone interview early tuesday			0
