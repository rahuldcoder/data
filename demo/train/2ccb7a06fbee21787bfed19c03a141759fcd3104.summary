back in august , when @entity1 began talking to exec producer @entity21 about this year 's show , one of their first conversations was about how the broadcast would honor @entity20			1
" it ought to be the best you can have with those two doing it , " @entity1 told @entity0 last month			1
" they 're the heirs to the torch			2
if anybody 's close to the stratosphere that @entity20 was cruising in , it 's them			2
that 's who it needs to be			2
" @entity0 : @entity3 - who will win ( and who should ) fans will also tune in to see what @entity1 and @entity41 come up with for their opening monologue			1

" it 's such a weird thing : on one hand , i 'm glad the government 's not shut down , but yet i 'm not			0
it 's horrible that the @entity85 website is such a disaster , but it 's also not that horrible because there 's a great song about that somewhere			0
we have all these things that we could talk about ... and all i can say is , ' go , @entity92 ! keep it up			0
' " @entity0 : @entity3 nominations 2013 - the snubs and surprises with @entity41 rehearsing for @entity99 's dec. 5 @entity98 , the two worked on material by texting each other whenever they came across something that might make for good fodder			1
" every time i get a text from @entity2 , i picture her dressed as @entity106			0
' in regards to twerking , ' and she 's dressed as a @entity109 writing that , " @entity1 said			1
