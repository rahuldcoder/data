@entity0 , @entity1 -- software developer @entity3 is n't concerned about which of the two most popular applications for personal finance people choose			1
it owns both of them			0
many families use either @entity10 or @entity11 year - round to track budgets and review billing statements			1
@entity3 , which also makes @entity14 , maintains the two personal - finance tools in tandem , and recent updates to each , such as the free mint ipad app that launched on wednesday or the major new version of @entity10 that hit stores last month , are indicative of how different their audiences think about their money			1
@entity10 2012 has a revamped look and a new debt - reduction - planning feature			1
@entity26 comes in many flavors and can cost anywhere from $ 30 to $ 150 , with one advertisement for a @entity10 credit card shown infrequently			2
it 's only available for @entity32 , and it stores data on the user 's computer , which is important for the security - minded but prevents people from accessing their accounts from multiple devices			0
on the other hand , @entity11 's website and applications , which can all provide access to a single account 's information stored on @entity3 's servers , are free with ads for cards , banks and insurance companies tailored to a user 's spending habits sprinkled throughout			1
@entity11 seems to push out updates to its website and mobile apps constantly , but the @entity57 version was a long - awaited release for many people who use the service regularly			1
the two tools take different approaches to money management and have each found niches			0
@entity26 has been around for nearly 30 years , whereas @entity11 was founded in 2006 and was acquired by @entity3 just a couple of years ago			1
" changing people 's habits is hard , " @entity3 co-founder @entity65 said in a recent interview			2
" @entity11 is for the person who does n't want to think			2
they do n't want to track or check anything			0
" @entity10 still has a sizable customer base , and people keep buying it because access to online services expires after about 31/2 years			2
at least three versions of @entity10 appear in the top 50 for software sold on @entity78 , but an @entity3 spokeswoman declined to provide sales data			1
she said @entity11 has more than 7 million users			2
about a third of @entity10 customers buy a new version every year , and another third upgrade every three years , said @entity86 , an @entity3 senior product manager			1
presumably , the last third either loses interest in tracking their bills or switches to something like @entity11			2
one might assume that @entity10 users are obsessively tabulating each transaction they make rather than letting computers do the thinking , either due to a mistrust of their banks or a mistrust in storing their sensitive info in the cloud			0
however , more people are using the automatic input mechanisms provided by financial institutions , while only 20 % to 30 % of @entity10 users input manually , according to @entity86 's research at @entity3			1
" most people do n't like to do all that manual data entry , " @entity86 said			0
" people are n't as scared of the internet anymore			0
" so @entity3 has beefed up @entity26 's web - based features			0
if people choose not to use these features , they can bask in the safety of keeping everything on their own machines			0
the @entity11 and @entity10 teams keep each other informed about what they 're working on for their respective software , but the development teams are separate , @entity86 said			1
@entity3 is mulling how it might converge the two apps , or at least make them more interoperable , but it has no immediate plans to build that bridge , he said			1
@entity3 has managed to ward off many competitors over the years			0
@entity128 made several attempts of its own , most notably with the @entity132 program			0
when it struggled to make inroads and then failed in its $ 1.5 billion bid to acquire @entity3 in 1994 due to federal antitrust concerns , @entity128 retreated			0
according to @entity65 , who founded @entity3 with @entity137 , @entity128 's @entity136 admitted to him privately , " we thought we could copy your products , but we could n't copy your word of mouth			0

@entity3 makes some of the most popular financial management programs
@entity11 and @entity10 , in many ways , compete with each other
@entity3 is not concerned about pitting two apps against each other if it owns both
