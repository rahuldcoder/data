" there are a few corners where we know we can be a bit faster , so tomorrow morning we will try to make some small changes to the setting to allow that , then i need to get a good start			0
" my leg feels better than yesterday , which is good			0
the problem today is the shoulder because my left one is n't strong enough to compensate completely for the lack of power in my right one , and now i have some pain in both !
