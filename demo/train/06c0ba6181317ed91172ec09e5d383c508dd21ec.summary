water tests after a chemical spill in @entity2 are encouraging , the governor said , but it 's unclear when people might be able to use their taps again			1
about 300,000 residents in nine counties in the southwest section of the state ca n't use tap water			1
" our team has been diligent in testing samples from throughout the affected area			2
the numbers look good and , like last night , they are very encouraging			2
i believe that we 're at a point where we can say that we see light at the end of the tunnel , " @entity2 gov. @entity16 told reporters sunday			1
@entity22 , president of @entity23 -- a company affected by the spill -- said that officials will begin lifting the water bans by zone			1
certain areas will be prioritized , including downtown @entity29 , but decisions will also depend on test results			2
he declined to put a timeline on when the do - not - use orders will be lifted			2
" i do n't believe we 're several days from starting to lift , but i 'm not saying today , " @entity35 said			1
officials have warned water customers to watch for symptoms of exposure to the chemical , which is used to clean coal , such as skin irritation , nausea , vomiting or wheezing			1
@entity46 , secretary of the state 's @entity47 , said sunday that more than 1,000 people had called the @entity50 , concerned about their exposure to contaminated water			1

residents were told to use bottled water to wash hands , brush teeth or take showers			1
the federal @entity74 sent 16 tractor - trailer loads of bottled water to help and the water company also provided truckloads			1

" we had bathed , cooked and everything right before the news came on yesterday			0
" " i do n't know anything about the chemical to say too much good or bad about it , so we 're all up in the air , " said @entity104			1
" we 're common folks -- we 're not chemists			0

" that 's one of our biggest concerns for the community , " @entity126 said			0
the goal : less than 1 part per million officials will know that the water is safe for more than firefighting and toilet flushing -- its only sanctioned uses now -- when tests find less than 1 part per million of 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol in treated water , said @entity35 , with @entity23			1
four laboratories have been set up to measure the levels in a uniform manner			0
" the treatment plant must consistently produce samples at or below this level before the current do - not - use order is lifted , " he said			0
@entity165 maj. gen. @entity164 said sunday that sampling and testing at the water treatment facility showed a consistent number of below 1 part per million for 24 hours at the outflow of the facility			1
" this allows us to move forward to the next phase of sampling and testing throughout the system , " he said			0
though the water woes since thursday have led scores of businesses to close , @entity80 said that some restaurants were reopening after devising alternative plans			1
the problem affected people of all ages			1

the leak happened about a mile upriver from the @entity23 plant			0
@entity206 , chief of the @entity209 's @entity74 and @entity208 group , said officials estimate that 7,500 gallons -- the equivalent of about 10 hot tubs that can accommodate eight people each -- leaked through a 1 - inch hole in the tank 's stainless steel wall			1
" it 's an old system , " he said about the physical plant , adding that the company had planned to upgrade it			0
@entity221 , the deputy emergency manager for @entity222 , said the tank appeared to be " antique			0
" " when i see a riveted tank i know it 's an old tank , " he said			0
@entity206 expressed confidence that the chemical , which smells like licorice , did not start leaking long before thursday morning , when it was reported			2
" we would have gotten odor complaints earlier than that if it had been going on longer , " he said			0
after concluding late thursday afternoon that the tap water was contaminated , officials issued a stop - use warning to customers in @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity222 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity245 counties			1

" you have to change your mindset of how you do things right now			0
" an investigative team from the @entity279 on saturday deployed to the scene of the spill			0
the @entity279 is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents			2
@entity197 president @entity283 said two @entity285 employees noticed material leaking from a storage tank into a dike around 10:30 a.m. thursday			0
they contacted authorities and began the cleanup process -- including hauling away the chemical still in the tank and vacuuming up some from the nearby ground , he said			2
" we have mitigated the risk , we believe , in terms of further material leaving this facility , " he said			0
but @entity221 , the emergency management official , said it did n't appear the company was in emergency mode when his team began to arrive thursday			2
" they did n't appear to understand the magnitude of the incident at the time , and we did n't either because we just got there , " he said , adding that investigators from the @entity305 had also arrived and took the lead in the investigation			2
" it took a little bit of time to get a determination how serious it was , " he continued			0
" i never got a good indication from the plant folks how bad the leak was , how much was going to the river , anything else			0
it was probably a little ways into the incident before we realized how bad it was getting into the river			0
