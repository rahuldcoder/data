@entity1 @entity0 , a tourist from @entity3 , has come to @entity1 's @entity5 bridge on a mission of love			1
to celebrate her marriage of 28 years , she attaches a padlock to the bridge 's rail then throws the key into the river below			1
" our love is locked forever , " she says			2
it 's an act that 's been repeated thousands of times , barnacling the @entity5 with a dense mass of " love locks			1
" but its popularity is now straining both the bridge and @entity1 's relationship with its romantic visitors , prompting a campaign that seeks to outlaw the trend			1
@entity27 @entity26 and @entity29 @entity28 say they co-founded @entity31 because the padlocks are endangering historic landmarks and have become a threat to safety			2
' vandalism ' " i understand that this is a modern expression of love and it 's cool , but history should not be compromised , " says @entity36			2
" it 's almost painful to watch this vandalism			0
" she and @entity28 say the @entity5 , built in the 1800s under @entity45 and damaged in a 1979 barge collision , might not survive much longer unless authorities act			2
the bridge currently carries about 700,000 locks with an estimated combined weight of 93 metric tons -- roughly the same as 20 elephants standing on a bridge designed for pedestrian traffic			1
sections of fencing have already fallen out under the weight only to be replaced by unsightly wooden panels			0
no @entity31 has created a petition that 's collected more than 2,200 signatures			1
" we just want to give back to the city we love and protect its heritage and beauty , " says @entity36			0
" one lock is a poem ; hundreds of thousands are a conundrum			0
" pollution concerns according to the official @entity1 website , the padlock trend started in 2008 and was initially seen as charming			2
but the practice quickly got out of hand , with padlocks spreading to other bridges and reappearing as quickly as authorities removed them			1
there are concerns that the keys thrown in the @entity82 will add to the river 's existing pollution			0
graffiti , pickpockets and vendors selling cheap padlocks have also become a problem , prompting many locals to avoid the once picturesque promenade			0
" @entity92 feel helpless because we do n't want to appear unwelcoming to tourists , " @entity36 says			0
" but people need to understand that what you 're doing is impacting the residents of the city you love			0
" she points out that a lock is an inappropriate symbol for love in @entity104 , a country where the main annual holiday celebrates an historic assault on a prison -- the storming of the @entity109			2
@entity110 , the deputy mayor of the @entity1 neighborhood that includes the @entity5 , agrees that the locks have become invasive			1
" the public has to know that a public monument is not there just for lovers , " he says			0
" [ the bridge ] has an historical perspective as one of the most beautiful spots in @entity1 between the @entity121 and the @entity122			1
" both @entity110 and @entity123 want to find another place for the locks , mirroring similar schemes in @entity127 and @entity128			0
" travelers want to leave their mark on @entity1 -- it 's touching and we understand that , " @entity36 says			1
" but show love to the history , to the beauty first , and maybe not putting a lock is the most loving thing you can do			0

the no love locks campaign seeks to outlaw the practice of *affixing* padlocks to @entity1 's historic bridges
the @entity5 bridge is *groaning* under the weight of 700,000 padlocks and is at risk of collapse , campaigners say
a petition to *ban* the locks and move them elsewhere has *gained* more than *1,700* signatures
