-- remember earlier this year when @entity1 went black in protest of anti-piracy legislation moving through the @entity4 ? yeah , well , that may be nothing compared to this			1
a group called the @entity8 , borrowing a page from @entity10 , is trying to create a " bat signal " for mobilizing open - @entity13 activists against similar legislation			1
the group 's tagline : " make sure the @entity13 never loses			1
" technically , it 's more of a " cat signal , " since the group 's website , which launched a couple weeks ago , features a picture of a cat 's face being broadcast into the sky			1
" it 's a cat signal because we see the cat as the symbol of the @entity13 , " said @entity25 , co-director of the nonprofit @entity26 , which helped organize recent piracy legislation protests and is behind the new site			1
" there 's this academic theory ... that talks about if you ban the ability of people to share cat photos , they 'll start protesting en masse			0
" she added : " the idea is we 're building the infrastructure to put up this cat signal or this bat signal all over the internet at a moment 's notice , with the click of a button			1
" the @entity13 went haywire in january when @entity4 was considering two pieces of legislation -- nicknamed sopa and @entity55 -- that aimed to help the government crack down on the online distribution of pirated content			1
the english - language version of @entity1 shut down for 24 hours in protest of the proposed legislation , which died after the digitally based protests			1
@entity63 , the parent company of @entity0 , supported the legislation , along with several movie and music industry groups			2
the @entity8 says it is targeting two upcoming pieces of legislation , @entity69 and @entity70 , which take different approaches to regulating pirated content			1
the group also will seek promises from @entity76 presidential candidates on the subject of @entity13 openness and legislation , according to @entity25			1
" for the past 10 years at least , tech policy has not been based on what 's good for the public interest , " she said			0
the group says it has the support of some big names on the @entity87 , including @entity88 , craigslist founder @entity89 , @entity90 , the @entity91 and the @entity92 , which owns several humor blogs			2
@entity25 declined to comment on whether larger commercial websites like @entity95 and @entity96 would consider supporting the effort			0
pundits have wondered whether this is the dawn of a new era for @entity13 activism , especially from tech and @entity87 companies that , in the past , have been less political			2
" this is the first real test of the political strength of the @entity87 , and regardless of how things go , they are no longer a pushover , " @entity105 , from @entity104 , told the @entity106 during the @entity87 protests in january			0
" the web taking a stand against one of the most powerful lobbyers and seeming to get somewhere is definitely a first			2
" the @entity8 aims to expand on that energy , alerting supporters to new threats to " internet freedom " when they arise			1
a co-founder of the group , @entity90 's @entity123 , explained the idea to @entity125 this way : " you can only cry ' oh my gosh , they 're going to shut down the @entity13 ' so often			2
we 've scared ( @entity4 ) from doing anything as egregious as @entity54 and @entity55 again			0
but the new challenge is this endless series of smaller bills that try to unravel internet rights			2
" on its site , the group pitches its battle against @entity140 legislation as a sort of duel between all - knowing geeks and uneducated or " confused " public officials : " internet freedom and individual power are changing the course of history			1
but entrenched institutions and monopolies want this to stop			0
elected leaders often do n't understand the @entity13 , so they 're easily confused or corrupted			0
" it adds : " with the combined reach of our websites and social networks , we can be massively more effective than any one organization			0
" the internet defense league site lets people donate money to the cause and , perhaps more powerfully , rally people for or against certain pieces of legislation			1
when there 's an @entity13 " emergency , " the group says it will send out snippets of code that will help websites participate in the protests			2
@entity25 said participating companies or bloggers can choose to have messages displayed on their sites automatically or to field the messages on a case - by - case basis			0
by creating the code for web developers to use , @entity25 said it become much faster to mobilize people online			1
that 's what made the @entity87 blackouts so effective , she said			0
" the tool was easy to use			0
it was a low bar to being used , " she said			0
" that was a turning point because the form of protest was very stark and clear and was an example of what internet censorship could look like			0
" and these tools allowed us to reach millions of people very quickly			0
