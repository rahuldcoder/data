@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the searing heat of an @entity5 afternoon , work continues busily on the vast building site that fills an entire block of @entity0 's otherwise quiet town center			1
polls suggest the @entity11 's @entity10 is heading for another victory			1
a massive @entity14 - style shopping complex is rising from the ground			2
next the local mayor , @entity16 , has plans for a smart new bus terminal on the outskirts of this small regional capital a couple of hours north of @entity21			0
designated a " preferential province , " investors in @entity0 already receive lucrative tax breaks			0
now @entity16 hopes to tap into @entity26 funds as part of his efforts to put the town on the map			0
" @entity0 is generally known for being a rural , modest province , " @entity16 tells @entity2			0
" but we are becoming more integrated			0
we are connecting @entity0 to the rest of the world			0
" @entity0 is typical of the @entity1 provincial towns and regions that are beginning to emerge from the shadow of @entity38 and @entity21 driven by surging economic growth -- and the sort of place where campaigning ahead of sunday 's parliamentary elections is at its most fierce			1
yet the issue that forced prime minister @entity11 into early elections showed how fragile @entity1 's young democracy can still be -- and how a dispute in @entity21 's corridors of power can still tip the entire country into political crisis			1
@entity11 's critics in @entity1 's traditional establishment accuse his @entity10 ( @entity10 ) of @entity53 tendencies and of plotting to dilute the secularist principles of the modern @entity1 republic , as laid down by the country 's revered founder , @entity56			1
that came to a head in april when the government nominated the country 's foreign minister , @entity61 , for the presidency			2
the fact that @entity61 's wife chooses to wear a headscarf prompted a secularist outcry , with opposition lawmakers backed by the constitutional court blocking the nomination , millions protesting in @entity21 , @entity38 and @entity71 and even the leaders of the army -- the traditional defenders of secularism -- issuing an e-mail in which they stated their readiness to intervene in the event of the election of a president not to their tastes			2
in @entity0 , it is hard to see how the headscarf could have become such a potent political symbol			0
many women here chose to wear them , but plenty of others do n't and life continues harmoniously as it has done for decades in this culturally conservative country			0
@entity93 , a local @entity10 parliamentary candidate and one of a new breed of technocratic young politicians attracted by the party 's modernizing instincts , told @entity2 the real divide in @entity1 was between " those who want the old order to continue and those who want the old order to change			1
" he argues it has been the @entity10 -- rather than the main opposition @entity105 ( @entity106 ) led by veteran politician @entity107 , the self - styled defenders of @entity56 's legacy -- that has argued for closer integration with the @entity26 and for a globalizing drive that has brought visible benefits to places like @entity0			1
" we represent the people who believe @entity1 should open up and that the old ways of doing things no longer work for us			1
we do not reject secularism -- we just argue for a more user - friendly secularism			2
we do not think it should matter if a woman chooses to wear a headscarf			0
" final polls ahead of sunday 's vote suggest the @entity10 is heading for another victory , but this is not a straightforward election			1
the party still faces the job of electing a president and has vowed to press ahead with constitutional changes to prevent a similar crisis occurring again			2
but without securing an unlikely two - thirds majority , it could find itself blocked by its parliamentary opponents just as easily after the elections as before them			2
and while the @entity106 is not expected to get the votes it needs to form a government , the secular establishment remains a dominating presence in @entity1 politics , notably through its close ties to the army , which has acted four times since 1960 to bring down governments of which it disapproved			1
also damaging for the @entity10 has been a surge in @entity1 nationalism , largely on the back of reaction against regular terrorist attacks by the @entity154 which have led military chiefs to call for action against @entity157			1
that feeling has been capitalized on effectively by the @entity159 ( @entity160 ) , which may well achieve the 10 percent share of the vote necessary to enter parliament , further shifting the political balance of power			0
particularly successful in rural areas , the @entity160 is challenging strongly in @entity0 -- an @entity10 stronghold -- to win a place on the list of three @entity169 the province will send to parliament			2
for @entity174 , an @entity21 - based political analyst and newspaper columnist , the main question surrounding sunday 's vote is not who will win , but whether @entity1 can return to anything approaching normal politics after a bitterly polarized campaign			1
" politicians are ruining @entity1 democracy , they are ruining people 's trust in politics , they are ruining people 's faith in politicians , " @entity174 told @entity2			1
" there needs to be a little more calmness , a little bit more of a sense of responsibility for the immediate future			0
i 'm talking two weeks down the road when they come back to parliament and you have a country to run			0
they have to make some compromises and compromises i think have to begin now			0
