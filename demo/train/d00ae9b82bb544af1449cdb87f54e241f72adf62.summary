@entity0 -- dozens of people , many tapping on iphones and discussing the " @entity7 " biography , lined up at a shopping center here on thursday			1
but these @entity9 fans were n't in line to buy the company 's latest gadget			2
they were here to see " @entity7 : the @entity13 , " a documentary of sorts that 's now playing in a handful of @entity18 cities			1
this particular screening of the never - before - aired interview with the @entity9 co-founder was set to be the final one at this theater , but producers extended its run after showings sold out			1
the film 's interviewer , @entity26 , watched in the audience and answered questions afterward			0
the 69 - minute interview with @entity7 was taped in 1995 for a @entity32 documentary called " @entity33			1
" the program aired only nine minutes of @entity7 ' statements			1
the master copy of the interview was lost in transit , but director @entity39 had secretly kept a copy on @entity42 tape , @entity26 said			0
after @entity7 died in october , @entity39 went searching through his garage until he found it			2
" it was the first time in 16 years he touched the tape , " @entity26 told the audience at thursday 's screening			0
" it wo n't be lost for another 16 years			0
" after the movie completes its brief run in theaters , " @entity7 : the @entity55 " will probably be made available online and on dvd , @entity26 said			1
over the course of one month while pitching the idea to @entity58 , @entity26 and a small team shot an introduction and tacked on a brief text recap that runs without sound at the end			0
the production is crude , as is the low - quality footage from @entity42 , but @entity7 is captivating			1
he told stories with charisma , enthusiasm and his flair for dramatics			0
he spoke candidly and with emotion			0
" he never sat for another interview like this , and what a shame , " @entity26 said			0
the interview shows @entity7 as alternately witty , charming , cranky and bitter toward those he believed crossed him			1
at the time , @entity7 had left @entity9 and was running a small computer company , @entity77 , that targeted the education market			1
@entity77 was purchased by @entity9 the next year , and soon after , @entity7 was again running the company he founded with @entity80 in his parents ' @entity82 garage			1
@entity26 , then a technology columnist , managed to score a coveted interview with @entity7 because @entity77 desperately needed the attention and because @entity26 and @entity7 had a prior relationship			1
@entity26 worked for @entity7 in the early days of @entity9 , where he had turned down stock in the company for a $ 6 - an - hour wage			1
the filmed interview drew laughs from the audience at several moments			0
in one instance , @entity26 asked whether there 's a hidden meaning when @entity7 uses a nasty four - letter word to describe his employees ' subpar work			2
" no , " @entity7 said , it meant exactly what it implied , and he explained that the " a players " do n't require him to " baby their egos			2
" @entity7 reminisced about his early days with @entity80 , including the time they made a prank phone call to the @entity110 and asked for the pope			2
he also panned @entity112 and @entity113 , and was particularly nasty toward @entity114			2
" the only problem with @entity114 is , they just have no taste , " he said in a now - famous line			2
@entity7 predicted the meteoric rise of the @entity120 , which he said would be especially satisfying because @entity114 does n't own it			1
he also described how he runs a business and the difference between workers who specialize in process versus content -- an imbalance he said tainted @entity112			0
@entity7 was especially critical of @entity128 , the @entity129 executive who he hired to run @entity9 and who later fired him			1
@entity7 described @entity128 as a corrupt marketing guy and a failed manager who was wrong for the job			0
he also expounded on the importance of a strong leader but added that companies are not just about one person			0
" people like symbols , " @entity7 said			0
" so i 'm the symbol for certain things			0
