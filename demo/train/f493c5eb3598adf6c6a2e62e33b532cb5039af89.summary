@entity0 has gained a lot from golf			1
at the age of just 25 , she has already earned nearly $ 9 million			0
but the @entity4 , dubbed the " @entity11 " due to her on - course attire and love of a certain fluffy toy , also gives a lot back in return			1
" if you ask me who 's @entity0 , the golfer , i 'll tell you i 'm the player who wants to give back to kids as much as i can , " she told @entity12			1
the 2010 @entity19 champion dedicates a lot of time , and money , to helping future generations make their way in the game as she has done			1
" it 's one of the most humbling experiences i 've ever had , " the world @entity26 said			0
" there 's more to the game when you 're playing in front of kids			1
" @entity35 is about the young kids , it is about growing the game , letting it play 100 , 200 years from now			1
" that 's why she has invested part of the $ 8.7 million she has earned on the @entity41 in helping others			0
for instance , she has offered scholarships at @entity46 's @entity45 , which she attended			0
the sky is the limit one of the kids @entity0 has worked with is @entity50 , an 11 - year - old who plays at @entity52 's @entity51 , the same course where two - time major winner @entity54 grew up			1
" @entity0 has motivated me with advice and i have been playing better golf ever since i met her , " she said			1
" i 've won five tournaments on different ( @entity52 ) courses			1
" @entity50 is the only girl to have won the award for best student at the @entity62 @entity51 golf academy			1
" @entity0 is interested in my education , she asks me what ( scores ) i 'm shooting and tells me that the most important thing is to have fun , to have a good attitude , but most importantly , to have a good time whenever i play golf			1
" @entity50 only gets to see @entity0 once a year , when the @entity41 circuit comes to @entity52 for the @entity73 in @entity62			1
she and her brother @entity74 skip school -- with their parents ' permission -- to get a glimpse of their favorite player			0
the most significant thing @entity0 has shared with @entity82 and @entity74 , besides several gifts like balls , caps and even the @entity11 she carries on her bag , is to " never give up ... the sky is the limit to achieve your dreams			1
" @entity91 others at the age of eight , @entity92 never imagined that meeting @entity0 -- who at the time was 17 -- would change her life			1
@entity0 was playing the @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity46 , but food poisoning forced her to withdraw			1
" she went out to watch , " @entity92 remembers			0
" i hung out with her and she was very nice to me the whole time			0
" two months later , " i went up to the @entity101 and practiced with her for a couple days			0
" however , it was n't until she started playing golf in high school she realized how much of an impact @entity0 had made in her life			1
@entity92 could have been interested in one of the other 140 golfers that play regularly on the @entity41 , but says " @entity0 is very relatable			1
" she is young , energetic , and very kind ... now i can always think back and remember how dedicated she was in high school			0
" one of the most valuable pieces of advice @entity112 gave @entity92 was to respect the rules			0
" i was playing with a friend of mine in a tournament and she tried to get away with cheating until i stopped her			0
" @entity0 wrote me back saying , ' i heard that you had some rules problems but you did the right thing			1
never let someone get away with breaking the rules , even if they are your friend			0
it might be one of the hardest things to do , but the rules are there for a reason			0
' " education is the cornerstone @entity134 , 19 , studies engineering at @entity136 , in @entity137 , @entity46			0
he knows that without @entity0 his academic life might have not been the same			2
" without her generous financial support , i seriously doubt that i would be halfway through my second year at a private engineering college , " he said			0
at 13 , when @entity134 was in 8th grade , @entity0 offered two one - year scholarships to attend the @entity145 academy , located in @entity146 , @entity46			1
@entity134 competed with five other kids and , after several interviews and essays addressed to the @entity150 , he got the financial aid			0
his progress , on and off the course , was so good that @entity0 decided to extend the scholarship through the rest of high school -- another three years			2
besides playing golf at the academy , @entity134 " realized that my career goal was to become a golf course architect			2
" his admiration for @entity0 grew quickly as he realized that she was determined to help others off the course			2
" @entity0 and her family were also actively involved in our local chapter of @entity166 ( a youth development program )			2
each year , they would help us to raise money for it , " he said			2
now , @entity134 analyzes the way @entity0 handles media			2
" she was always so poised , looking directly into the camera , and speaking clearly			0
i have used that model in speeches for fundraisers , for classes in school , and in speaking to people with whom i have a business - type relationship			0
" long distance @entity182 lives in @entity183 , but she has not been able to attend an @entity41 event			0
nevertheless , @entity0 is a huge inspiration to her			2
" she makes me think about golf and she makes me want to play golf more , " the eight - year - old said			1
but how can a girl who has never met her idol feel this way ? her coach , @entity192 , is responsible for introducing her into @entity0 's world			2
her husband @entity194 , an @entity41 rules official , contacted the golfer and her family			0
" she wrote a note to me and what it says is ' practice hard and have fun ' ... she gave me her shag bag with a lot of pink golf balls , " @entity182 said			0
@entity205 , the girl 's mother , believes @entity0 is an example of " a woman who has worked hard to be able to do what she enjoys most			2
" @entity0 's attention and advice has helped @entity182 identify golf as a game for girls			1
she has made quite an impact			0
" i dressed up like @entity0 for @entity216 , i like her a lot			2
