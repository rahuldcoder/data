@entity0 @entity6 : signs of reform , especially political liberalization			2
the chances of meaningful political changes , or those that dovetail with global norms , however , are getting increasingly slim			1
the reason may be simple			0
until around about the time of the @entity18 protests in 1989 , to reform or not to reform belonged in the realm of ideology			2
even before the birth of the @entity25 in 1949 , factions within the party had fought over the future direction of the country			1
when @entity29 was running the show , there was the celebrated " struggle between two lines			0
" this referred to the fierce competition between the @entity35 -- who claimed to uphold unadulterated @entity37 -- and the " capitalist roaders , " led by then - president @entity38 and @entity39			0
after the @entity42 ( 1966 - 76 ) , @entity39 , the @entity41 , battled furiously with conservative patriarch @entity43 , who only wanted " [ market - oriented ] reform within a bird - cage			2
" in the run - up to the june 4 , 1989 massacre , @entity39 , who was paranoid about @entity5 succumbing to the winds of change that were sweeping @entity51 , mobilized the troops to torpedo the westernized political reforms championed by the liberal general secretary @entity54			1
since the early 1990s , three major factions have emerged within the party : the @entity58 faction led by ex-president @entity59 , the @entity60 ( @entity62 ) faction led by president @entity63 , and the " @entity69 " -- a reference to the offspring of party elders -- led by president - in - waiting @entity68			1
despite their apparent differences , these factions have come to a solid consensus on the major goals of the country			1
politically , the @entity7 must preserve its near - total monopoly on power			0
and while aspects of the economy are being integrated with the global marketplace , about 120 yangqi or centrally - held enterprises will continue to enjoy monopolies over key sectors , ranging from oil and gas to banking and telecommunications			0
moreover , an unprecedented number of the spouses and children of party elders have gone into business			1
some have become the yangqi 's senior managers			0
even more have used their sterling political connections to start highly successful private businesses in lucrative areas such as finance and real estate			0
these so - called " red capitalists " are evenly represented by members of the party major factions			1
critics of the government do not seem to be exaggerating when they say that 100 or so of the biggest clans that represent the country 's " red aristocracy " control the largest chunk of the economy			2
the official @entity112 has reported that the top 1 % of @entity5 families owns 41.4 % of the nation 's wealth , while a survey by the @entity118 indicated that 91 % of respondents thought the " nouveau riche " in @entity5 had benefited from their political ties to the @entity7 leadership			1
reform has become nigh impossible because any change of the political or economic status quo will threaten the vested interests -- and finances and earnings -- of these near - omnipotent @entity7 clans			1
@entity131 member and @entity132 party secretary @entity130 admitted this earlier this year			0
" at the early stage of reform , the obstacles [ to liberalization ] were mainly due to ideological differences , " he said			0
" now , the major problems faced by reform come from the configuration of interest groups [ at the top ]			2
" it is most unlikely that the fifth - generation leadership under general secretary - in - waiting @entity68 will change the rules of the game			0
while @entity68 , 59 , has the reputation of " @entity152 , " his siblings are multi-millionaires who have substantial investments in @entity5 and @entity0			2
quite a few of the members of the new ccp @entity156 ( @entity157 ) -- @entity5 's highest ruling council -- to be confirmed at the november congress are representatives of @entity5 's big clans			1
they include the vice-premier @entity163 , head of the @entity166 @entity165 , and vice-premier and @entity168 , @entity169			0
owing to the rigidity of @entity5 's one - party authoritarian rule -- as well as the political elite 's determination to uphold the status quo -- expectations of any kind of reform and liberalization have fallen to new lows among the @entity5 intelligentsia as well as ordinary folk			1
even though @entity5 watchers in the @entity185 are paying close attention to who will be inducted into the @entity131 and the @entity157 , @entity183 's largely apathetic political pundits are seized by a feeling of plus ca change -- the more things change , the more they stay the same			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

chance of meaningful reform from @entity5 's new leaders is slim
different factions have *reached* consensus on major national goals
an unprecedented number of *relatives* of party elders have gone into business
reform *complicated* by vested interests of these " red capitalists "
