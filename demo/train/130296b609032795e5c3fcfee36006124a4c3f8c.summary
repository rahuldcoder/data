-- for more than three decades , @entity1 represented the pinnacle of business travel -- the ultimate status symbol for the jetset executive			2
considered a marvel of aviation technology , the distinctive droop - nosed aircraft traveled at twice the speed of sound , flying from @entity10 to @entity11 in about three and a half hours -- half the time of commercial airliners			2
but even before an @entity1 crashed in 2000 , killing all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board , the luster was beginning to wane			0
battling high operating costs and low passenger numbers , @entity1 and @entity21 grounded their small , aging fleet a mere three years later			0
but the dream of supersonic flight has not disappeared			1
aviation manufacturers such as @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 are working on supersonic technology -- with the latter predicting it could have a supersonic business jet in service as early as 2020			1
industry expert @entity32 , the director of aerospace and defense consulting in the @entity35 for @entity36 's , says it 's likely that a next - generation supersonic commercial aircraft will emerge			1
high demand from passengers , historic profitability on the routes and significant technological improvements have combined to make supersonic flight all the more viable , he said			1

" faster flights consume fuel faster which makes the flight more expensive , " he said			2
" but this is a premium route , and premium prices will be charged			0
" crucial to the efforts to restore supersonic aircraft to the skies is the work of national aerospace programs such as @entity59 and @entity61 's @entity60			1
@entity62 is the supersonics research project manager for @entity59 's fundamental aeronautics program			2
while the agency is not working on a specific supersonic aircraft , he said , " we are working on technologies we feel represent barriers to bringing back successful supersonic aircraft			1
" those barriers include high atmosphere emissions , noise produced when taking off and landing , and the sonic boom -- the sound associated with the shockwaves created when objects travel faster than the speed of sound , which has prevented supersonic aircraft from flying overland routes			1

" @entity59 has been collaborating with @entity26 and @entity27 on systems - level design studies , with each manufacturer producing models that have been subjected to wind tunnel testing to gauge their effectiveness			2
@entity62 said phase one testing had successfully validated the basic design techniques			0
reshaping the aircraft , the designs -- @entity26 's two - jet configuration with engines mounted above the wing , and @entity27 's tri-jet configuration , with two engines below the wing and a third mounted in the tail -- had been proven to significantly reduce the sonic boom to a " thump , " dropping the noise from @entity1 levels to close to what is considered the level of acceptability			1
@entity62 said he expected to see a next - generation " son of @entity1 " in the marketplace by around 2030 , while a supersonic business jet " could happen sooner			1
" " the boom is the barrier and if we can get past that , i think we 'll see people giving supersonic flight a lot more serious consideration , " he said			1
the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) also hopes to develop a supersonic passenger aircraft that is quiet , economical and environmentally friendly , and expects to achieved it some time this century			2
spokesman @entity128 said that while the agency currently had no aircraft in specific development , along current projections it predicted a supersonic business jet to enter the market some time after 2015			1

" it will herald a return to supersonic civil flight without @entity1 's environmental and economic drawbacks , " said @entity28 spokesman @entity143			1
he said development of a joint venture with aircraft manufacturers to produce the @entity141 had been slowed by the recession , but once a deal was struck he anticipated a six - year development program to bring the aircraft to market			2
" we believe the @entity141 will be certified , and enter service around the end of the decade -- 2020 , " he said			0
but not everyone is convinced that a return to supersonic passenger flight is just around the corner			0
@entity165 , head of market analysis with aviation experts @entity167 , was skeptical that there would be much progress before at least 2030			0
" i think there 's so many issues to be considered that i certainly ca n't see it happening in the next 20 years , " he said			0
@entity165 believes that although technological barriers will likely be overcome , the key factor in whether it will become a reality is whether a market exists that is prepared to pay a premium for the ultimate status symbol in business travel -- particularly in an air - travel market that is focused on low prices			1
" will you have enough passengers willing to pay higher fares to fly more quickly ? " he said			0
" if you look at @entity1 , that was n't the case			0
it came along at a time when the 747 also came in , which carried more people for lower fares			0
that 's where the market was			0
" @entity198 , director of @entity199 , also believes that a return to supersonic flight is further off than some are making out			2
" there seems to be multiple technological and commercial obstacles that will need to be cleared , " he said			0
but he conceded : " i 'm sure that when the original plans for @entity1 , the @entity208 and the @entity209 were announced , the same questions about whether it could be achieved were asked			0
i think time will tell			0

the quest continues for a next - generation supersonic aircraft
@entity28 predicts it will have a business jet in service by about 2020
@entity59 is close to *muffling* the sonic boom that prevents overland supersonic flight
some analysts question whether a market exists for expensive supersonic travel
