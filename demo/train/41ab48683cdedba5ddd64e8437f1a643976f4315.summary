-- coffee shops in the @entity3 city of @entity4 have banned foreign tourists , except those from @entity7 and @entity8 , from entering their premises from saturday , according to the local association of coffee shops			1
coffee shops in the @entity3 are places where customers can legally buy and consume cannabis			1
" we have put in place a ' neighbouring country ' criteria , " @entity16 , president of the @entity17 and owner of the @entity20 coffee shop , told @entity0			2
" this is a form of self - regulation			0
it is not a law , there will be no judge , this was just the only choice we had			0
" the move comes after @entity4 's city council decided that something had to be done about the 2.2 million visitors that come to the city every year , according to @entity16			1
" the visitors put a lot of pressure on the city when they come here and make it very busy on our narrow streets			2
so the city said that something had to be done about the traffic and nuisance , " he said			2
" but the biggest nuisance is n't the number of coffee shops or the clients , but the illegal drug runners that can be quite aggressive and start fights and rob the tourists			1
" all visitors to @entity4 's coffee shops -- some 6,000 a day , almost three - quarters of whom are foreign , according to @entity16 -- already have to show their passports and their information is then kept for 48 hours			1
now only those with a @entity3 , @entity7 or @entity8 passport will be allowed in			1
" a number of people will leave disappointed , and we are not very proud of refusing entry to visitors who have come to our shops for the last 28 years and never caused a problem , " said @entity16 , who has himself used cannabis for 35 years			2
" the question now will be if they instead buy from the illegal drug runners here or if they buy illegally in their own countries			0
" nobody from @entity4 city council was available for comment saturday			1
a spokeswoman for @entity4 police told @entity0 that the police were not a party to the ban and that it is not illegal for foreign tourists to enter the city 's coffee shops			1
the spokeswoman , who is not named in line with department policy , said police would not carry out any identity checks to enforce the ban			0
" we will just go about our normal business and carry out our duties where needed , " she said			0
at spokeswoman at the tourist office for @entity4 , which lies near the @entity8 border , said it was not aware of the new rules			1
the @entity17 decided on the ban in july but it only came into effect october 1			0
the organization is also working on a plan to move seven of the city 's 14 coffee shops to the outskirts , where foreign tourists can then go and buy hash and marijuana , @entity16 said			1
" but the first relocation wo n't happen until june 2013 , so we had to put this ban in place now , and we could then change it again once we 've completed the relocation			0
" at these new sites , the parking ( areas ) will have direct access to the coffee shops , so the drug runners ca n't approach the clients as they walk to the coffee shop			2
" @entity16 also says the @entity3 government wants the coffee shops to operate on a smaller scale and is planning to impose a nationwide ban on anyone who does n't hold a @entity3 passport buying cannabis			1
" they want to put this ' weed pass ' in place from january 1 next year , but we are strongly against this			0
" a press release on the @entity3 @entity139 website from may this year says coffee shops will become private clubs where only adult @entity3 citizens can become members			2
" the @entity144 expects that closure of coffee shops to foreign drugs tourists will ensure that they no longer travel to the @entity3 to purchase and consume cannabis			1
after all , many of them can use the illegal markets available in their immediate surroundings , " the press release says			0
the statement does not give a date for the implementation of the new measures			0
@entity0 's calls to the @entity3 justice ministry were not immediately returned			2
but @entity16 says cannabis supply is not only a @entity3 problem			0
" this is also the responsibility of the other @entity163 governments ; nobody is taking responsibility for those millions of customers who want to buy cannabis for their own use , " he said			0
" it is time to get their heads out of the sand to get a decent drugs policy in place to address this problem			0

@entity4 city authorities say they need to cut visitor numbers
many visitors cross the border to use cannabis in the city 's coffee shops
now only @entity8 and @entity7 tourists will be allowed in to such shops
