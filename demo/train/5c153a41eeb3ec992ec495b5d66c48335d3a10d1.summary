@entity0 for years @entity2 has been the envy of the world , hailed as the great ' economic miracle ' thanks to its sustained double - digit growth			1
of late , however , the @entity9 has also become the poster boy for environmental degradation , a target of ridicule for @entity0 's now notorious " airpocalyse			1
" even @entity16 president @entity15 could not resist dissing @entity0 's bad air			1
" i would just point to one simple example , and that is you would not want your kids growing up in @entity0 right now , because they could not breathe , " president @entity15 said while defending his controversial environmental regulation last week			1
" and the fact of the matter is that used to be true in @entity27 -- as recently as 1970			1
and the reason it changed was because of the @entity31 , " he added			0
lessons like @entity27 , @entity0 sits in a virtual ' bowl			1
' surrounded by mountain ranges , air -- clean or dirty -- typically gets trapped when there 's no wind blowing			2
this similar geography hopefully delivers valuable anti-pollution lessons @entity0 can heed			2
speaking at a recent forum held at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity27 mayor @entity40 said that pollution is n't the result of bad geography alone but " human activity in that bad geography			1
" like @entity0 today , @entity27 in the last century went through a rapid rise in population and an economic boom			1
" with this followed demands for more power , more jobs , and the rising middle class that did things like buy cars and drive them , " @entity40 said			2
" we grew and are proud of that growth , as you here in @entity0 should be too			2
but it came at a cost			0
" " our first smog attack came near @entity65 , and it was so bad that some thought it was a chemical weapon attack by @entity69 forces during the war			2
" as the @entity27 population grew , smog in the 1950s and 1960s got worse			2
" our economy thrived but our air did not			0
like @entity0 today , 60 years ago @entity27 was fumed up from oil refineries , power plants , our steel and chemical plants , " @entity76 said			1
pollution came at a human cost			0
" in the 1970s when i grew up			0
we breathed the dirtiest air in the world , " @entity40 explained			2
" kids were kept from playing outside			0
emergency rooms were filled with patients			0
" three step plan to beating pollution @entity40 ticked off three effective measures to combat the smog			1
step 1 : face the truth , accept it and own it			0
when @entity27 was in self - denial , " we used polite words to describe smog , like ' it 's just a hazy day ' or ' it 's overcast ' , " @entity40 recalled			1
step 2 : build a strong government for enforcement			0
in 1963 , the government passed its first @entity31 , which mandated governments at federal and local levels to get involved			0
in 1970 , it passed its first emission standards for cars			0
step 3 : get the public sector and ordinary people involved to make sure that the government 's held accountable			0
private groups and civil society played important roles as whistle - blowers and watchdogs			0
the city did not have to sacrifice growth either , @entity40 said			1
" when you pair a regulation with innovation , you get a pro-growth policy , " he said			0
" turning to new green energy not only improved @entity27 's pollution problem , it sparked an entirely new clean tech industry that attracted new businesses in our city and employed tens of thousands of people			1
" " today , i 'm the mayor of a city that has seen the population double at the same time we reduced ozone level by nearly two thirds			2
we have beautiful sunny days , with clear skies throughout most of the year			0
" consolation it may be a small consolation for @entity0 to know that when @entity27 was mired in bad air and dirty water , the skies in the @entity2 capital were clear			1
i fondly remember @entity0 in the 1970s and 1980s , when rivers where clean and people fished and swam			0
except for the few days when sand storms whipped up from the @entity154 desert swept over @entity0 , the city 's sky was typically blue			1
of course , @entity0 then had a few industries , life was spartan , population movement was severely restricted , and most people got around via bicycles , not cars			0
the encouraging news is residents and officials in @entity0 now agree that @entity2 needs to clean its air			1
last month , when @entity0 hosted the annual @entity167 summit meeting , @entity2 officials pulled out all the stops to ensure the sky was clear -- forcing factories to close , limiting the number of cars on the road and declaring a six - day holiday to encourage citizens to leave @entity0			1
most of the days turned out to be smog free , prompting people to coin the phrase " @entity167 blue			0
" of course , these are short - term fixes and @entity2 needs to make sure long - term measures come to fruition			0
@entity2 's foreign ministry said in response to a question on president @entity15 's swipe it hoped that " @entity167 blue " could last permanently			1
let 's hope they 're successful because at stake is the health and well - being of millions of @entity2 , not to mention @entity2 's national pride .			2

@entity2 is a " poster boy " for environmental degradation
president @entity15 recently took a swipe at @entity0 's bad air
@entity27 ' battle with air pollution could hold lessons for @entity2 , says city 's mayor
