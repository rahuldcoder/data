-- the fight against gun - related crime has taken a hit from budget cuts , as a federal agency has laid off nearly a hundred contract workers at its facility dedicated to tracing firearms used by criminals			1
ninety - eight contract employees at the @entity12 , firearms and @entity10 lost their jobs as of march 31 because of the forced budget cuts known as the sequester			1
the @entity16 confirmed the layoffs with @entity0 and offered a written statement : " @entity23 was forced to cut its budget by $ 82 million across the board , including its firearms program and , as a result , 98 contractors in its @entity21 , @entity22 , facility firearms program have been laid off so far			1
" those 98 were among 380 contract workers and 185 full - time federal employees at the @entity21 facility			1
neither the agency nor the @entity16 would speak on the record about the layoffs			0
" laying off employees at the @entity10 is a big deal , " said @entity34 , a former @entity23 special agent who once headed the agency 's firearms program			1
now , he 's policy adviser for @entity41 mayor @entity40 's gun safety group , @entity42			0
" getting information on purchasers to law enforcement as quickly as possible is a critical need			1
" the firearms bureau hired the contract workers because requests for gun traces kept rising while the bureau 's budget for full - time positions did not , @entity34 told @entity0			2
when there 's a gun - related murder , or when a police officer is shot , the agency 's goal is to trace the purchaser or the owner of the gun within 24 hours			0
" my understanding is , they will still do whatever possible to meet that deadline , though now it 's going to be much harder , " @entity34 said			0
" they 've had to take resources from other sections to do it			0
" he said those other sections deal with tracing stolen firearms and keeping records that help police investigate firearms trafficking			0
" it 's not that things wo n't be done , " @entity34 said			0
" it 's just that things wo n't be done as quickly , " a potentially major problem because , " some crimes , time is of the essence			2
" on top of it , @entity23 has a labor intensive method of gun tracing			1
because of federal laws aimed at preventing a federal gun registry , much of the @entity23 's record keeping is done by hand , rather than by computer			2
so the labor cuts hit that much harder .			0
