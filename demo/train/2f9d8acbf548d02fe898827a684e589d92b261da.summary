@entity2 is the quintessential metropolis , the city other cities aspire to be			1
frenetic , chaotic and glamorous , it may not be the capital of @entity5 , or even @entity6 , but in many ways it 's the capital of the world			1
@entity2 's skyscrapers are instantly recognizable architectural icons			1
more than anywhere else , @entity2 symbolizes the @entity12 and the aspirations of the 20th century			2
ever since it was christened @entity15 in 1694 it has been a beacon for immigrants , the @entity17 where anyone can be anything they want			0
the " huddled masses " who disembarked at @entity28 under the gaze of the @entity30 built a city on hard work , determination , and a belief that anything was possible			0
the result is the @entity32 , the city that never sleeps , the place where you can make things happen			0
@entity2 is a celebrity city -- even if you 've never been there you 'll recognize it from countless movies and tv cop shows			1
there 's something innately cinematic about its skyline of tapered high - rises reaching towards the heavens			0
the skyscrapers of @entity45 and @entity46 may be more modern , and those of @entity48 and @entity49 more immense , but only @entity2 's are instantly recognizable architectural icons			2
when most people think of @entity2 they think of @entity53 , but there are of course four other boroughs in the city , each made up of countless distinct neighborhoods			1
the relentless pace of @entity2 life means no neighborhood maintains its identity for too long -- you wo n't find many @entity64 in @entity65 these days			0
watch @entity66 take my city_my life on a tour of @entity2			0
Â» it also means that the latest " in " place will soon be " out " , giving way to the newest up - and - coming neighborhood known by a suitably convoluted acronym -- whether its @entity76 ( @entity77 of the @entity78 ) , @entity79 ( @entity79 ) , @entity80 ( @entity80 ) or @entity81 ( down under the @entity75 )			1
while @entity53 is still the beating heart of the city , rents there are beyond the reach of most @entity2 , and the relentless tide of gentrification has flowed into the other boroughs			1
where @entity2 was once known for its mean streets , mayors @entity89 and @entity90 have cleaned up the city with their zero - tolerance approach to crime			1
the city 's murder rate is now a quarter that of the early 1990s , the height of @entity2 's crack epidemic			1
while no one would complain about that , some feel that recent noise laws and bans on smoking indoors and serving trans fats in restaurants are signs that the city is losing the edginess on which it always thrived			0
the last century may have belonged to @entity2 , but the world is changing			2
@entity113 is staking a claim as the world 's financial capital , with @entity117 and @entity46 close behind			0
and while the @entity32 practically invented the idea of " cool , " cities like @entity119 and @entity120 are building a reputation as hipper , grittier alternatives , where the real underground action happens			0
they 're the reason the city bounced back from 9/11 , the @entity129 and various @entity131 crises			0
they put up with the noise , crowds and the astronomical rents because they know there 's nowhere on @entity137 that can match @entity2 for sheer excitement			2
it 's still the city where anything is possible and , for hopeful dreamers around the world , it 's still the @entity143 , where anyone can be anything they want .			2

@entity2 is frenetic and glamorous , the quintessential metropolis
the city 's five boroughs are made up of countless distinct neighborhoods
despite up - and - coming rivals , it 's still the most exciting city in the world
