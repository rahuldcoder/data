-- a bipartisan group of lawmakers in @entity3 voted wednesday in favor of a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage , putting @entity7 on the path toward becoming the seventh state in the nation to legalize marriage for gay and lesbian couples			1
" with today 's vote , we tell the nation that @entity3 will no longer deny our citizens the opportunity to marry the person they love , " said gov. @entity14 , a @entity15 who has vowed to sign it			1
" we tell every child of same - sex couples that their family is every bit as equal and important as all other families in our state			1
and we take a major step toward completing a long and important journey to end discrimination based on sexual orientation			0
" the law will go into effect in june , when the legislative session ends , unless opponents halt its implementation by putting it on the november 2012 ballot			2
the 55 - 43 vote in the @entity42 included two republicans in support of the bill			1
the @entity47 vote last week was 28 - 21 and included four republicans			1
" like thousands of other same - sex couples , my partner @entity53 and i are very grateful for these protections that the law now provide , " said state rep. @entity49 , a @entity50 , moments before the vote			1
" but domestic partnership is a pale and inadequate substitute for marriage			0
" in @entity60 : inside my society - destroying family state rep. @entity64 , a @entity65 , disagreed			2
" marriage is about life , " he said			0
" it 's about joining that man and that woman as husband and wife and mother and father , linking them with their natural - born children or adoptive parents and carrying forward our civilization			1
" the @entity81 , which opposes the law , has said it will seek to gather the 120,577 signatures needed to put the issue to voters as a referendum in november			2
the group did not immediately return a call			0
@entity89 , director of the @entity90 of @entity7 , has said the issue should be put to a public vote			1
" if we as a state are going to take the position that mothers and fathers are interchangeable and replaceable , if we are going to send a message to fathers and potential fathers in this state that it is n't important to be in the lives of their children because dads specifically do n't matter , that is something we should all do together , " he said last month			2
preacher : why i fight for traditional marriage but @entity110 , director of public engagement for @entity112 , questioned the fairness of a vote			1
" is it appropriate for all the voters to vote on the rights of a small minority group of people ? " she asked			2
advocates of same - sex marriage have followed several paths toward legality in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and the @entity7			2
" in each state , the question of marriage has come up either through the courts , through the legislatures or directly at the ballot , " @entity110 said			0
" i think this demonstrates the growing support nationally amongst @entity65 , @entity138 and @entity139 who see that allowing committed and loving , same - sex couples to get married does not take anything away from the marriages of their friends , neighbors and family members			0
" the benefits of same - sex marriage translate into benefits for the larger community , said @entity110 , citing one study that predicted $ 88 million in additional spending would occur in @entity7 once the practice becomes legal			0
" it 's a real boost for small business in particular , " she said			0
preacher : why i support same - sex marriage in 2009 , @entity161 state legislators passed a same - sex marriage bill that drew subsequent challenges by opponents who pushed for a referendum that ultimately overturned the law with 53 % of the vote			1
proponents are trying to get it back on the ballot this year			0
gay rights advocates have already garnered thousands of signatures in an effort to force a second referendum in november			0
in @entity176 , a 2008 public vote outlawed gay and lesbian couples ' right to wed. two years later , a federal district court overturned the voter - approved measure known as @entity181 , saying couples were unfairly denied their rights			1
a federal appeals court ruled tuesday against @entity176 's ban , arguing that it unconstitutionally singles out gays and lesbians for discrimination			0
sound off on @entity189 : what 's your view ? the ban has remained in place during the appeals process and could soon get a ruling from the @entity60 @entity197			0
similar battles have unfolded in @entity199 , where same - sex marriage opponents have pressed for referendums to counter bills that appear to enjoy growing support in their state houses			1
