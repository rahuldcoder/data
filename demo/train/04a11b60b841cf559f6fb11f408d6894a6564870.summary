-- it was a beating , a thrashing , a rout , a waxing , a debacle			0
sport is well - equipped with words to describe what took place in the semifinal match between @entity11 and @entity12 on tuesday , but none of them , at least not yet , can capture what really went down			1
one of the oft - cited reasons @entity17 give for not embracing the most popular sport in the world is the low - scoring action that generally personifies the so - called beautiful game			1
excuse me ? in this semifinal 's first half , @entity11 scored five goals in 18 minutes , goals that came so fast and so furious one could hardly keep track : minute 11 , minute 23 , minute 24 , minute 26 , minute 29			1
the final score of 7 - 1 , which propelled @entity11 into the final and @entity12 into a game for third place , is historic in and of itself			1
and never before had five goals been scored in the first half of a @entity35 match			0
never before had four goals been scored in a six - minute stretch			0
and that it took place in @entity12 is no small matter			0
despite the uproar over the money the nation spent building soccer cathedrals , most @entity45 were not only ready to celebrate victory , they expected it			0
their national team had not lost an official game on home soil since 1975 , making the dream of winning the country 's sixth @entity35 title seem not just obtainable , but a sure thing			1
the most brutal ( and funny ) @entity11 vs. @entity12 tweets without question , excuses can be made			1
@entity12 played without its captain and central defender , @entity60 , who had been suspended after the match against @entity62 for the accumulation of yellow cards			0
without him , the @entity45 defense appeared powerless and confused against the likes of @entity68 and company			0
also missing , of course , was @entity12 's star , forward @entity71 , who had been kneed in the back by @entity74 @entity73 , fracturing a vertebra in his spine			2
but it is unlikely even a healthy @entity71 could have created balance against such offense			0
@entity11 was relentless perfection , taking advantage of every opportunity @entity12 offered while simultaneously creating its own prospects			1
tears , puns and a @entity87 record some now worry that the disenchantment on display before the tournament started -- the fury of protests against the billions @entity12 spent on the tournament marked by " @entity94 " signs throughout the country -- will reignite in force , now that the home team can only hope for a third - place finish at best			2
indeed within seconds of the end , @entity87 feeds wrongly assumed images of rioting @entity45 demonstrated postgame fury when , it turns out , people were posting older photos of the protests that had taken place throughout the spring			0
and as the inevitable finger - pointing against coach @entity107 and his players begins , we can hope that sanity will prevail , taking to heart @entity107 's wisdom in his wrenching postgame press conference that " life goes on , " rather than the criminal soccer passion that apparently led to the killing of @entity74 @entity116 , who scored the own - goal that led to his team 's loss against the @entity17 in 1994			2
there are signs to give hope that the love for the game in soccer - crazed @entity12 , a country that truly epitomizes what it means to live and breathe a sport , will transcend the devastation of the historic 7 - 1 score			1
at the conclusion of the semifinal match , weeping @entity45 stood in tribute to the @entity134 team , which had just handed them their most humiliating moment since their loss in 1950 to @entity137 , considered by many to be one of the most shocking results in @entity35 history			2
5 things about the beat down in @entity12 without question , this game , and on home turf , trumps that earlier one			2
but the act of respect shown to @entity11 by the @entity45 ovation in @entity152 stadium demonstrates how sometimes it is more important to love the game than to win a game			0
because it 's the beautiful game , indeed .			1

@entity158 : @entity12 trashed by @entity11 at @entity35 , but it was more : it was historic
she says @entity11 's rout , with fast , furious scoring , *denied* @entity12 its sure - thing victory
she says excuses can be made , but @entity11 was *great* ; @entity12 coach wisely said " life goes on "
@entity158 : @entity12 fans gave *splendid* display of " beautiful game " by standing in tribute to @entity11
