@entity0 , @entity1 -- the fact that you now can explore the ocean through @entity6 is n't going to make @entity8 much money directly			1
but the move is nonetheless smart			1
the new @entity6 5.0 software allows users to explore the ocean depths from their computers			1
@entity8 generated early - stage goodwill from being the best answer to the online search problem			2
but the company is large and getting larger , especially as it shows a better ability to withstand the recession than rivals , and that goodwill wo n't last forever			0
@entity6 , though , gives the company a new way to bring its brand to the world , notably with students for whom the software will help supplant atlases and encyclopedias			2
and in the long run , as @entity6 and @entity31 -- either as standalone software or used through a browser -- will likely become a widely used virtual window on the real world			1
@entity8 will control the technology and commercialization of that portal			2
will the visibility of the ocean depths on @entity6 make money directly ? not likely			1
but it adds incrementally to the overall utility of the software , which in the long run keeps it relevant			1
" the near - term opportunity is in local search , " for example people looking for restaurants or hotels , said @entity46 , director of @entity6 and @entity31 , in an interview			0
@entity8 has begun experimenting with advertisements on @entity31 and @entity6 , added @entity54 , product manager of @entity6 , at the launch event			1
since people often need to discover information about a place before going there , @entity6 and @entity31 could prove a lucrative endeavor			0
it may take years to get there , and it 'll cost @entity8 dearly in server hardware and network bandwidth , but @entity8 has shown patience in subsidizing long - term projects			1
though @entity46 would n't reveal the expense of @entity8 's geographic services , some of the economics are in the company 's favor			1
just as @entity8 's search engine takes advantage of innumerable information that others put on the @entity76 , @entity6 is a platform that houses information supplied by outsiders that @entity8 does n't have to pay			1
it 's the @entity76 's user - generated content story , but this time it 's data that can be overlaid on a map of the @entity80			1
and in the case of the ocean work , there are prestigious users generating high - quality content			2
many ocean researchers gathered at the @entity6 5.0 launch , and several showed there 's pent - up demand for a way to conveniently display their data somewhere			1
and it 's not just to share sea surface temperature data with fellow @entity94 , but also to try to educate the public			2
@entity96 , communications director for the @entity97 , was excited about his layer in @entity6 that shows the location of various types of fish -- along with ratings for people about whether they should eat those varieties or substitute others			2
@entity106 of @entity107 and @entity108 of @entity109 were eager to show the tracks of shark travels recorded by radio transmission to satellites			2
@entity114 of the @entity115 showed a @entity6 animation of the gradually shrinking @entity118 ice cap over the last 29 years			0
and @entity119 of the @entity120 has supplied underwater video of the @entity122 as part of the foundation 's mission to chronicle the state of coral reefs			0
@entity46 envisions much broader information , though , including consumer - oriented material such as the best dive spots and kite - surfing areas			0
ultimately , he wants " every single location " on @entity80 , land or sea , to have information			1
" we 're trying to encourage our users to annotate all the places in the world			0
part of what we 're doing is seeding that ecosystem of spatial information , " @entity46 said			0
" that creates an opportunity for @entity8 to provide location services on phones , mobile devices , in cars in the future , to guide people to the best places			1
being a valued guide , the go - to source of information about the best places to go -- that will be a powerful and valuable thing for @entity8			2
" think of it as a second internet in a way , only instead of using abstract names to locate information , you can use actual locations to locate information			0
some refer to the idea as the " geographic web			0
" the clearest illustration of the indirect benefits @entity6 can bring is the fact that the company could persuade former vice president @entity173 , whose climate change documentary won him an @entity175 and a @entity176 , to bear the @entity6 standard			0
in effect , he provided an eco-halo that can offset the more down - to - earth capitalistic realities of @entity8 's operation			1
@entity8 seems to share the altruistic , educational motivations of many researchers			1
but it 's also got business in mind with @entity6			0
" we try to create products people love to use , " @entity54 said			0
" we create value , then think of appropriate ways of monetization			0

imaging the ocean depths via the new @entity199 is a smart move for @entity8
it adds to the overall utility of the software , which in the long run keeps it relevant
ocean researchers attended @entity8 's launch and are eager to display their data
eventually , @entity8 wants to provide data on " every single location " on @entity80
