if @entity1 is really on the verge of buying video game - streaming website @entity3 , there 's at least one reason behind the move that 's as old as business itself : eliminating the competition			1
little known outside the gaming world , @entity3 has quietly skyrocketed , claiming 43 million monthly users just three years after it launched			1
those users , @entity3 says , watch an hour - and - a - half of video a day , much of it live coverage of things like video game competitions and other players working their way through new games			1
as it turns out , watching people play video games is a big deal on the @entity26			1
at @entity1 , which is owned by @entity28 , some players have amassed follower bases of more than 1 million people by posting video of themselves gaming			1
so when an upstart like @entity3 comes along , analysts say , it makes sense for @entity28 to act			1
" for @entity28 , this is a defensive measure as much as it is anything else , " said @entity35 , a technology analyst with @entity36			2
" @entity28 found early on with @entity1 that play - throughs of video games were a huge traffic draw			1
if you do n't watch those videos , you do n't even know they exist on @entity1			2
but for people who watch them , that 's all they see			0
" on sunday , both the @entity48 and @entity49 were reporting that @entity1 is in talks to buy @entity3 for more than $ 1 billion			1
neither company was commenting publicly on monday			0
@entity52 and @entity53 are among several other companies who were reportedly trying to purchase the site			0
more than just a place to stream video , @entity3 has also succeeded at becoming a social network of sorts , @entity35 said			2
comments are integrated into the site 's videos , letting viewers talk with each other , or even the players themselves , as they watch			0
" it 's no longer just wanting to see how someone defeated the boss on @entity71 , " he said			0
" it 's having that social experience and the comradeship of fellow gamers			0
@entity3 has nailed that and if you 're @entity28 , you realize that people watching stale old videos ... that 's going to dry up			1
" and on the @entity81 , traffic means money			0
advertisers like live events because of the level of excitement they create and the fact that they can reach a target audience all at once , @entity35 said			2
@entity3 made headlines in february when a version of " @entity93 , " a 1990s game for @entity96 's @entity95 , streamed on the online video platform for days , allowing more than 80,000 people to play simultaneously			1
for @entity3 , the appeal of an eight - figure deal ( aside from the eight figures ) would be gaining @entity28 's arguably unrivaled resources to support and expand its site			1
in some ways , @entity3 's massive growth in a short time has been a blessing and a curse			1
@entity3 generates more traffic than @entity110 in the @entity111 and has tripled the amount of bandwidth it uses in the past year , according to @entity114 , a networking - equipment company			2
" to be quite honest , we ca n't keep up with the growth , " @entity3 vice president @entity116 told @entity117 last year			2
" that 's a good problem to have			0
" add @entity28 to the mix , and that problem disappears			2
" i think the whole concept started as a social experiment , " @entity35 said			0
" it became a commercial business so rapidly that they were n't prepared and they did n't have the resources ...			0
when @entity28 wants to care about the outcome of your business ... it ends up being a really good deal			0
" in this way , it 's not unlike @entity137 's recent purchase of @entity138 , which gave that upstart maker of virtual - reality headsets access to @entity137 's vast resources and user base			0
regardless of the outcome of this deal , @entity35 says live streaming is something @entity1 is going to have to figure out			1
increasingly , the entertainment industry is using live tv events -- from " @entity149 " to live voting on " @entity151 " -- to attract viewers who have become increasingly spoiled by the overabundance of digital media at their disposal			0
" the next thing you 're going to have to get into is live - streaming your high school football game or you trying to conquer a new rail with your skateboard , " @entity35 said			1
" if you can get into a world where someone wants to show off that they 're better on the half - pipe than anybody else in the world , you could have a couple thousand people watching live to see if you can pull off that back flip			0
