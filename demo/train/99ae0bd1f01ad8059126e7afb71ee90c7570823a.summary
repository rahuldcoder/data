-- every athlete competing at the @entity2 has an incredible story to tell , of how they overcame tragedy or a disability they had been born with to be considered the best in the world in their chosen discipline			1
but for some the final , bureaucratic hurdle can prove a step too far			2
on thursday it was revealed that the @entity16 swimming team 's great hope of a gold medal in the pool -- 17 - year - old @entity19 -- had been denied a classification to compete			1
@entity21 had dreamed of making the @entity23 able - bodied swimming team until a neurological disease put her in a coma for two years			2
when she woke up she was paralyzed in both legs			2
yet @entity21 continued to swim and this year broke two world records			2
but after the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) reviewed her case , @entity21 was told she could not compete			1
it had been decided that @entity21 's disability was n't severe enough			1
it appeared that she had lost out because of the complex system of disability classification , an essential tool for the @entity41 movement			1
follow @entity0 's live @entity2 blog and she 's not the only one to suffer			1
fellow @entity16 swimmer @entity44 , who lost the use of her legs after a routine epidural injection went wrong , declared she had " lost faith " in the system when her classification was changed just before the start of @entity23			1
" i have trained the past four and a half years for these games and within less then 24 hours before my first race was supposed to start it all changed , everything i had prepared myself for these past four years changed right there and then , " said the 23 - year - old , who had been hoping to compete for nine golds but can now only go for seven			1
complex such is the myriad of different disabilities , and severity of disabilities , each athlete has to be evaluated and placed into a category to compete alongside others of the same potential			1
athletes are placed in one of six main disability groups : those with spinal injuries , cerebral palsy , amputees , the blind or visually impaired , intellectual disabilities and those whose disabilities fall outside of those categories , like those born with dwarfism or multiple sclerosis			1
each of the @entity2 ' 20 sports are divided between the different classifications and given a number that denotes the severity of the disability -- 1 being the most severe , 10 the least			1
join the conversation on @entity88 # cnnparalympics " classification exists in the @entity93 as well , " explains dr. @entity89 , a former @entity90 @entity41 middle - distance runner and academic at @entity91			1
" men and women do n't compete together , and in boxing and judo it 's based on weight , but in the @entity2 it gets broken down much more finely			1
" so take people with visual impairments			0
you have the @entity104 class where someone has 10 % vision , @entity108 class with 5 % vision and @entity110 no usable vision at all			0
" it has a huge impact on how you can train			0
if you have no usable vision you need someone to train with you			0
if you have 10 % they can , and they do , move around on their own			0
that gives them a huge advantage			0
" talent , not disability in recent years the @entity30 has complicated things further by trying to slim down the number of medals and disciplines and look beyond the disability as the defining factor in classification			1
instead , it says , look to the potential of the athlete			2
" during classification ... athletes are assessed for their ability to perform in a particular event , " the @entity30 explains			1
" ' @entity138 ' in this case refers to an athlete 's functional potential and is not an assessment of their disability : this is a complete reversal of the old systems that were clinical and medical in origin and often intrusive			1
" this is why @entity150 , the @entity152 double amputee " @entity150 " who made history by becoming the first track and field paralympian to compete in the able - bodied @entity93 -- can line up against runners with only one prosthetic leg			0
in the pool on thursday , @entity159 's @entity158 won gold in the 100 meters backstroke , destroying the field despite not having any arms			0
according to @entity89 , back when he was competing , the procedure to determine classification was very different and also highly intrusive			2
" when you compete for the first time they make sure you are not fiddling the system , " he says			0
" you have a medical doctor -- i have mild cerebral palsy -- physio and a technical expert			0
now they have the ability to examine classification after competition			1
they used to run them before major competitions and force athletes through them			0
i refused until after the contest because it can be quite exhausting			0
" the move towards streamlining the classifications and having less medals to give out also has it drawbacks			1
" swimming is a bit of fiddle , " says @entity89 when asked about the @entity21 case			0
" i was there to see the @entity197 lad @entity196 win gold , the roar was amazing			0
" but the thing is when they came out ( of the pool ) he looked the most able			0
he was the only one not using a stick or wheelchair			0
" there 's a water - based test and a land - based test , and an element that you are on a performance curve -- and that discourages training			0
you want to be on the right side of the thin line from the next category			0
" the politics of classification but , of course , competitive sport is competitive sport -- and rival teams regularly refer athletes for reclassification if they feel they have an unfair advantage			2
the @entity41 movement has also been stung by several high - profile scandals			0
the @entity225 @entity41 basketball team was stripped of their gold medals at the @entity227 after it emerged that some of the players were n't properly tested and were not intellectually disabled			2
the controversy saw the entire category of intellectually disabled sport withdrawn from the next two @entity93			2
it is only now , in @entity235 , making a comeback			0
" there 's a huge amount of politics in classification , " agrees @entity89			2
" i was never asked as an athlete , ' do you think the contest was fair ? ' for the athletes ( like @entity21 ) it can be hell			2
when this does happen the athletes come together ' @entity249 ' style			0
" @entity21 returns in the end that is exactly what happened to @entity19			0
after an outcry the @entity30 reviewed the evidence again and cleared her to compete in this weekend 's 400 meters heats , one of the most anticipated events at the @entity260			1
but it is unlikely to be the last time the issue of classification hits the headlines			1
" i 've been involved since 1986 and it 's always been an issue , " says @entity89			2
" it 's getting much better			0
but i worry that by bringing in less categories they ( the @entity30 ) are trying to be more media friendly			1
if it is fair , fine , but i am against that if that stops different impaired bodies being involved			0
" we must not forget that , first and foremost , the @entity2 is about celebrating difference			1
it 's not about ability versus disability			1

the issue of disability classification at the @entity2 has caused controversy
each athlete is placed in events according to disability and ability
