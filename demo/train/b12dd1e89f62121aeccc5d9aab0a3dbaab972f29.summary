@entity0 -- vice president @entity2 has " condemned			2
" secretary of state @entity3 scolded -- and then leaked the scolding			2
on background , @entity6 aides fret that the @entity9 announcement of new settlement construction may thwart resumption of the peace process			1
let me advance an unorthodox opinion : the most dangerous cause of instability in the @entity17 is the so - called peace process itself			1
i know this is an unusual point of view			2
by my count , there have been at least 10 major outbursts of violence between @entity25 and @entity26 in the @entity17 since 1936			1
every one of these conflicts ended in a similar way			1
either outside powers imposed a ceasefire -- or else @entity9 halted military operations just before a ceasefire could be imposed			2
every one of these conflicts began in a similar way , too : with a renewed attack by the @entity26 side , or else ( as in 1956 or 1967 ) by @entity26 violations of the terms of the previous armistice or ceasefire			2
think for a minute how unusual this is			2
wars usually end when one side or the other decides it can not continue fighting			1
the losing side accepts terms it had formerly deemed unacceptable because the alternative -- continued fighting -- seems even worse			2
i doubt many @entity51 are delighted to have lost more than half their territory to neighbors in @entity54 and the former @entity55			2
@entity56 still remember the loss of their @entity58 to @entity59 in 1884			0
some in @entity60 continue to regard @entity61 as rightfully theirs			0
yet for the most part , these nations have reconciled themselves to these unwelcome outcomes			0
exactly the opposite has occurred in the @entity26 - @entity9 dispute			1
@entity67 lost the @entity68 in 1956 , but got it back			0
it lost the @entity68 again in 1967 , and again recovered it ( although this time the right way , after signing a formal peace )			1
@entity72 lost the @entity73 in 1967 , attacked @entity9 in 1973 , lost again -- and still demands the return of the territory			0
palestinians rejected the 1947 partition , resorted to war , lost , and to this day demand compensation for their losses			0
it 's like a game of roulette where the management stops the game whenever you begin losing too badly , with promises to refund your money as soon as it conveniently can			0
what gambler could resist returning to the tables ? i understand why @entity95 governments have acted as they have			0
they have feared that unless they somehow smooth the situation , the world oil market will be upset and radical ideologies will spread through the @entity102 world			1
what they do n't see is that their efforts to contain the problem have in fact aggravated it			0
imagine this alternative history : suppose that the western world had not intervened in 1949			1
suppose the @entity9 war of independence had been fought to the bitter end : @entity26 armies breaking apart and fleeing , commanders laying down their arms , columns of refugees crossing the @entity117			0
the 1949 war would have ended not with an armistice , but with a surrender			1
@entity125 refugees would have had to settle in new homes , just as the hundreds of thousands of @entity25 expelled from their former homes in the @entity26 lands resettled in @entity9			1
the outcome would have squelched any hope that more fighting would have yielded a different result -- and the more decisive result might have dissuaded @entity26 governments from any further attempts to resort to force			0
in the 1990s , the former @entity55 erupted into war			0
new states with new borders were carved out of the old country			0
thousands of people were displaced			0
happily , the conflict did end			1
the displaced adjusted to life in their new homes			0
former enemies may still mistrust each other , but violence has faded and seems unlikely to return			0
suppose instead the world had agreed that one of the combatant ethnic groups -- the @entity154 , say , but it really does not matter -- retained a permanent inextinguishable right to reclaim its former homes			1
suppose the world agreed to pay displaced persons from that group billions in foreign aid on condition that they never permanently resettled in the territory to which the ethnic group had moved			1
suppose the world tolerated @entity154 terrorist attacks on @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 as understandable reactions to injustice			1
would there be peace in the former @entity55 today ? the @entity17 peacemakers for the most part act with the highest of intentions and the most exquisite patience			1
but instead of extinguishing the conflict , they have prolonged it			2
a peace process intended to insulate the @entity26 world from the pain of defeat has condemned the @entity26 world -- and the @entity125 people above all -- to unending war			1
every war must end -- and end badly for at least one of the belligerents			0
it 's time for this war to end too , and at last			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1

@entity196 says the @entity17 peace process *unintentionally* prolongs conflict
he says other wars have ended with the parties adjusting to new reality
in @entity125 ' case , he says , much of the world feeds the dispute rather than resolving it
