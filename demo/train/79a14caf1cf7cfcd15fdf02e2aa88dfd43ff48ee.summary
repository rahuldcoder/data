@entity0 on the edge of their seats			0
now , 200 years on from his birth , his genius is to be feted with a host of events marking the bicentenary of one of @entity19 's most famous sons			1
@entity2 2012 will see everything from readings to royal visits , celebrating the man who gave the world " @entity25 , " " @entity26 " and " @entity27			1
" in @entity0 , the special events will begin with a celebrity performance , by actors @entity31 and @entity32 , at the @entity2 family 's graves in @entity35 on monday			1
and on tuesday , the anniversary of @entity2 ' birth , the @entity36 will lay a wreath at @entity2 ' grave in @entity41 , @entity42 , while actor @entity43 , @entity2 ' biographer @entity44 and the author 's great - great - grandson , @entity45 give readings			1
there are more commemorations planned across the country , and around the world , so what is @entity2 ' secret ? and why , above all others , is his work still revered , so many years after his death ? @entity56 , @entity2 specialist at @entity57 , puts his continued popularity down to his modernity			1
" everybody says this about absolutely every author ever , but @entity2 really was a peculiarly modern writer , very attuned to what was new ; he was writing at the beginning of the industrial revolution which , effectively , we are still in			2
" he would have been fascinated by @entity69 , for example -- he loved the telegraph , the railways , all sorts of modern communications technology , he was very ' on the button '			0
" @entity74 , co-director of the @entity2 2012 celebrations , insists that almost 150 years after his death , the " @entity25 " author still has something to say : " @entity2 is not some fusty historical figure , but still an ultra-relevant , dynamic innovator			1
" he rewrote the style , form and substance of the novel ; changed the process and dissemination of the printed word ; wrote the way a camera saw before film had ever been invented , and he remains the most cinematic of writers			0
" " a critic of the young @entity2 once said the writer ' would go up like a rocket and come down like a stick , ' " said @entity92 , director of the @entity93			2
" in 2012 , one thing seems to be sure : that rocket will not come down again			0
" 175 years after he first shot to fame at the age of 25 , @entity2 continues to be regarded as one of the world 's finest authors and storytellers , and one of the most influential figures @entity19 has ever produced			2
" but the @entity2 2012 celebrations are not limited to the @entity19 -- and fittingly so			1
" @entity2 ' fame and appeal spreads well beyond @entity19 , " says @entity56			0
" he has huge global reach , well beyond the bounds of this island -- he 's been taken up by @entity113 , set in the south seas , in ' mr @entity115 , ' and on and on			0
" the bicentenary will kick off in @entity117 , with the first part of a 24 - hour @entity2 read - a - thon to be staged in 24 countries across the world , from @entity121 to @entity122 , with readings from " @entity25 " in @entity124 , and " @entity125 " in @entity126			2
@entity127 , director of literature at the @entity129 , which has organized the event , agreed such a worldwide celebration was truly appropriate , given @entity2 ' international fame -- and his passion for performing			0
" reading aloud -- bringing characters to life -- was a crucial part of @entity2 ' life , " she said , adding that the event would be a " truly global homage to a great @entity19 literary giant			0
" and while many of the festivities are centered on february 7 , others will be much longer - lasting			0
one of the biggest commemorations of @entity2 and his works in 2012 is the @entity2 and @entity0 exhibition at the @entity147 ( until june 10 ) , which celebrates the author 's links with the city , and explores how it inspired so many of his novels			1
it features items from @entity2 ' own life -- including the desk he wrote at , his bank ledger , and the manuscripts for some of his most popular novels -- alongside items evoking life in @entity0 in the 19th century , from playbills , pub signs and theatre costumes to heartbreaking evidence of the extreme poverty @entity2 knew well from his own childhood			0
@entity0 's other big draw for @entity2 fans , the @entity93 , housed in his former home , is -- perhaps surprisingly -- to close for a large part of the bicentennial year , as part of a major refurbishment program , but it is expected to reopen just in time for christmas 2012 , when a further round of @entity2 celebrations are planned .			1
