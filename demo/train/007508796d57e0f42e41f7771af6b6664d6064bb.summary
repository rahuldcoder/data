-- if there were any doubts about the @entity5 's commitment to @entity6 , you can dispel them now after the @entity8 put forward a package of $ 15 billion , matching the sum initially offered by @entity11 before @entity12 was pushed out of power			1
the current tally is now $ 16 billion after a $ 1 billion commitment announced by @entity17 secretary of state @entity16 during his visit to @entity19 tuesday			2
@entity6 leaders have said they will be $ 30 billion in the hole by the end of 2015			1
about half of that debt comes due in 2014 and the country reportedly has about three months of cash reserves			0
without the support from the @entity8 , voters would have gone to the polls in " crisis mode " with the state nearly out of cash			0
the move by the @entity8 is also significant because it will also likely lead to funding from regional lenders : the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) and the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , both of which have deep pockets			1
@entity42 officials are on the ground in @entity6 assessing the economic situation			1
lending may prove to be more difficult in this period of transition			0
shareholders in the fund , 188 member states , usually hesitate to provide money when temporary leadership is in place			0
it is complicated by @entity56 president @entity55 holding the position that @entity12 was forced out of office			0
behind the scenes , commitments must also be coming from the @entity6 to start cleaning up corruption , something that was flagged as essential by @entity16 and during interviews i conducted this week			2
but @entity42 managing director @entity65 on tuesday expressed some willingness to proceed as her team was landing in @entity19 , saying in a statement " we are ready to respond , " and adding , " we are also discussing with all our international partners -- bilateral and multilateral -- how best to help @entity6 at this critical moment in its history			1
" this is very different from the tone taken with @entity75 after the ouster of @entity77 and the subsequent two years of turmoil			0
the $ 5 billion initially on the table from the @entity42 never materialized due to differences on how best to proceed with reforms			2
a crisis was avoided when @entity84 @entity83 filled the void with $ 15 billion instead			0
the stakes , some would say , are higher due to the @entity89 history surrounding @entity6			2
the next stage of the high stakes diplomacy surrounds whether @entity93 countries proceed with economic sanctions or not			1
while at a global financial forum here in @entity103 , former @entity100 president @entity99 told me , " economic sanctions would be appropriate of course if there is no deal " between the @entity17 and @entity56			1
former @entity17 secretary of state @entity105 took a similar position suggesting that the @entity93 countries , led by @entity108 , are marking their support for @entity6			1
" they 've sent the right signal so far which is saying ' hey wait a minute this is not acceptable ; we do n't like this and there is going to be some cost to it , " @entity105 said			0
