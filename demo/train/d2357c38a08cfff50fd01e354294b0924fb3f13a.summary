when teenage girls check out @entity2 , they 'll be getting the complete picture -- no ifs , ands or photoshopped butts about it			2
that 's the pledge the magazine 's staff made in its latest edition , after a push led by a @entity13 14 - year - old to combat the practice of tweaking pictures and picking models whose appearance give teens an unrealistic perspective on what is beautiful			1
" we vow to ... never change girls ' body or face shapes			2
( never have , never will ) , " the magazine states as part of its " @entity31 " from its august edition , a copy of which @entity27 obtained thursday			1
the treaty and accompanying note by editor - in - chief @entity36 promise that @entity2 will " celebrate every kind of beauty " and feature " real girls and models who are healthy , " while vouching that the magazine always has done just that			1
but the more than 84,000 people who signed a @entity47 petition , started by teenager @entity48 , clearly believed @entity2 and other publications did n't always present the full , unvarnished truth			1
" those ' pretty women ' that we see in magazines are fake , " the petition said , in requesting " one unaltered -- real -- photo spread per month			1
" " they 're often photoshopped , air - brushed , edited to look thinner and to appear like they have perfect skin			2
a girl you see in a magazine probably looks a lot different in real life			1
" retouching photographs is nothing new -- especially in magazines and , increasingly , on the @entity65			0
@entity66 and other digital image manipulation programs are widely employed by professionals and everyday users			0
the petition claims that disseminating such altered images to impressionable teens can pose a real danger , helping to spawn a culture that touts unrealistic beauty and contributes to eating disorders , extreme dieting , depression and more			1
on @entity79 , teens ask the world : am i ugly ? " i know how it affects girls and ... my friends , " @entity48 told @entity27 in may , shortly after meeting with @entity82 and presenting the signatures to her			2
" we do n't realize it sometimes when we 're just looking at the magazine and having fun			1
it can lower self - esteem			0
" but not all teenage girls think retouching photographs is a problem			0
@entity95 of @entity96 , @entity97 , said thursday she 'd worry that , if magazines portrayed young women who were overweight or had acne as being beautiful , some girls may think it 's ok to live an unhealthy lifestyle			2
in fact , she feels making models ' bodies thinner and their skin clearer can serve as positive motivation for people to take better care of themselves			0
" some people use that ideal image as motivation to get fit , eat healthy and stuff , while some use it as a crutch , " said the 18 - year - old , a rising freshman at @entity119			0
" you just have to be strong - minded			0
" in addition to going " more public " in its commitment , seventeen states in its latest edition it is partnering with the @entity126 and the @entity127			0
the magazine 's treaty also vows it will " be totally upfront about what goes into our photo shoots " and it understands that , " regardless of clothing size , being healthy is about honoring your natural shape			1
" " we vow to ... give you the confidence to walk into any room and own it			0
say bye - bye to those nagging insecurities that you 're not good enough or pretty enough			0
" even as she pushed another petition urging @entity142 to make a similar public pledge , @entity48 celebrated the proposals made by @entity2			0
" ' seventeen ' listened ! " she said in an update of her online petition			2
" they 're saying they wo n't use @entity66 to digitally alter their models ! this is a huge victory , and i 'm so unbelievably happy			1
" the magazine said that it will continue make small changes to photos , like erasing a stray hair or changing background colors , even as it insists it still wo n't make big changes to a person 's body or face			1
yet by not taking any responsibility for having presented anything but " authentic " beauty in the past , the magazine " does n't really address ( the ) criticism " from many that it has n't always lived by those rules , said former model @entity161			2
" @entity2 essentially says that it 's never had any issues with the way it 's photoshopped ... celebrities and models but that , just to be on the safe side , it will continue not altering the bodies of the people photographed , " said @entity161 , a contributor to the female - focused , commentary - driven online magazine @entity170			1
" it seems like 84,000 people who signed that petition seem to be of the opinion that there were some issues			1
" @entity161 said photo - editing tools have " made it incredibly easy to alter all kinds of things about image including body shape , size , skin color , skin tone , to erase wrinkles			2
and sometimes the effects are downright creepy			0
" the practice is widely used , and accepted , in the fashion and magazine industry -- such that many people now almost assume that most any image of a beautiful person is somehow doctored , @entity161 told @entity27			0
" we 've gotten used to the idea over the past 10 years or so that every single image we see in a magazine , particularly in women 's magazines , is going to be an altered , hyper - real , impossible idealized version of how that person actually looks , " she said			1
empowering young girls online " for young girls , that 's not a healthy visual culture to be growing up in			2
" @entity217 - based celebrity publicist @entity216 said on @entity219 's " @entity218 " that magazine editors generally are " not selling reality , they 're selling where the consumer desires to be			1
" " as much as we would like to think that ( media would show ) a more diverse array of the @entity230 public to young girls , that 's simply not going to happen , " @entity216 said , asserting you 'll find " pretty much the same type of individual " on covers of magazines such as @entity2			1
@entity236 -- a teen activist affiliated with @entity237 , a movement devoted to ending " the sexualization of women and girls in media " for whom @entity238 has blogged -- acknowledged on @entity219 that altered images are widespread and do negatively affect girls			1
still , she expressed excitement about @entity2 's new public declaration and anticipation that it will spur other publishers to follow suit			0
and if it does n't , she promised , young women such as she and @entity253 will keep pushing to affect change			0
" i definitely see that in the future , " @entity236 said			0
" i know that , myself personally and my co-workers at @entity237 will not change until this capitalization off of young woman 's body image stops			0
" what do you think about excessive editing in commercial photography ? has it had an effect on you ? let us know in the comments below .			0

seventeen publishes a " @entity31 " vowing to show " real girls and models "
it 's in response to a teen - led petition signed by 84,000 calling photo altering dangerous
the teen behind that petition celebrates a " huge victory " after the magazine 's announcement
but an *ex-model* questions why the magazine did n't admit to ever seriously altering images
