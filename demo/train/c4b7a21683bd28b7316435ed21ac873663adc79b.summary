@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 dissident @entity3 said thursday he ended his months - long hunger strike after the nation 's @entity5 announced wednesday that the @entity1 government will soon release 52 political prisoners			1
" what we want more than anything is to see our political prisoners of conscience freed -- as much abroad as in @entity1 , " he told @entity2 en @entity14 in an interview from a hospital in @entity17 , @entity1 , where he was being treated for complications associated with his fast			1
@entity3 said his departure from the hospital would depend " on how things evolve			1
" he said his medical team was " very worried " about two blood clots , one in his neck and the other in his chest			1
if either were to break free , " i could die quickly , " he said			0
" at least , if we die , we know that our brothers are going to live in liberty , " he added			0
@entity3 said the planned prisoner release may serve the @entity1 government in two ways -- by pressuring the @entity35 to lift its trade embargo on the island , and by buying the island 's leaders more time in power			1
" if they do n't take these measures , they 're going to lose control of the country , " he said			0
" what they want is to die in power			0
therefore , they 're trying to do some political pirouettes to hold on to power			1
" @entity54 's doctor and fellow dissident , @entity52 , said his patient was drinking water			2
but @entity3 remains frail , unable to eat solid foods , @entity57 said			1
the 48 - year - old psychologist and writer stopped eating in february to protest the @entity1 government 's imprisonment of political activists			1
@entity1 's @entity5 has announced the names of five political prisoners set to be freed			1
all five will leave @entity1 for @entity69 in the next few days , the church said in written statement thursday			0
in addition , the church said , six jailed dissidents will be moved to prisons closer to their homes			0
church officials had announced wednesday that a total of 52 political prisoners were set to be freed and allowed to leave the country			1
it would be one of @entity1 's largest prisoner releases in recent history			0
the announcement coincided with a visit by @entity69 's foreign minister , @entity86 , who met wednesday with his @entity1 counterpart @entity87 , as well as president @entity88 and @entity89 , @entity1 's @entity5 cardinal			0
the first five prisoners will go to @entity69 within a few days and the 47 others will depart within four months , @entity90 , @entity69 's @entity91 spokesman , said wednesday in a telephone call from @entity95			2
in april 2009 , @entity35 president @entity96 said he was seeking " a new beginning " in @entity35 - @entity1 relations			2
the @entity96 administration lifted restrictions on the ability of @entity35 to visit relatives in @entity1 as well as limitations on remittances			0
wednesday 's announcement raised questions about whether the releases will improve dialogue between the two cold - war foes , though many remained skeptical			2
" it 's a good thing , but we 've seen this before , " said @entity111 , deputy director at @entity112 , citing the hundreds of prisoner releases that followed a papal visit to the island nation in 1998			0
" despite these new developments , the law which allows for arbitrary arrests remains the same			0
" the @entity1 @entity5 identified the five prisoners to be released soon as : @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			1
the six prisoners expected to be transferred soon were identified as : @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			1
cardinal @entity89 met with @entity88 in may , describing it at the time as a " magnificent start " to talks surrounding the potential release of some jailed dissidents			0
last month , @entity1 released dissident @entity141 and ailing prisoner @entity143 , who is awaiting approval from the @entity35 government to join family members in @entity147			2
@entity143 's release drew praise from the @entity150 , which called it " a positive development			0
" the two countries broke off diplomatic relations in 1961 but maintain " interests sections " in @entity0 and @entity156 that operate like embassies			0
the founder of the @entity159 , @entity160 , recently put the number of political prisoners in @entity1 at 167 , the lowest number in decades			1
the 52 prisoners to be released were among 75 dissidents arrested in march 2003			2
the other 23 already have been released			2
a group of dissidents traveled from @entity0 to @entity3 ' hometown of @entity17 to persuade him to give up the hunger strike			1
one of them , blogger @entity171 , posted a photograph on @entity173 that shows @entity3 in a hospital bed and someone standing next to him holding a red cup			2
@entity3 is wearing a blue hospital gown and lying back on the inclined bed with his eyes closed			2
the photograph is captioned , " his first glass of water			0
" @entity3 began his hunger strike in february , shortly after jailed dissident @entity182 died in prison at the end of his own prolonged hunger strike			1
@entity187 's death sparked international condemnation from @entity189 and @entity156 , and drew a rare statement of regret from @entity88			0
@entity192 called on the @entity1 government thursday to immediately release all political prisoners , whom the human rights group calls prisoners of conscience because " they acted non-violently and were imprisoned under @entity1 legislation which illegitimately criminalizes political dissent			1
" in addition , the rights group said the @entity1 government must release the remaining political prisoners			1
attorney @entity204 is serving a 12 - year sentence on a conviction of " disrespecting authority and revealing secrets about state security police " after his peaceful manifestation of support for political prisoners , @entity192 said			1
" the @entity1 government must also end the harassment and intimidation of independent journalists , human rights activists and political dissidents , " @entity192 said in a statement			0
" @entity220 and arbitrarily applied legal provisions , used to curb dissent within @entity1 , must be reviewed to make human rights a reality for all @entity1			0
" @entity2 's @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
