he opened fire on police as they tried to break down his apartment door about 3:30 a.m. wednesday , wounding two officers , @entity20 prosecutor @entity19 said			2
wednesday evening , police switched off the street lights in the district around the apartment , leading to speculation that a new raid was imminent as talks stalled			2
three loud explosions and flashes of light erupted shortly before midnight -- but @entity36 spokesman @entity35 told @entity37 the blasts were meant to pressure @entity0 back into talks with negotiators , and police had not moved in on the apartment			1

@entity110 said in @entity5 on wednesday that he expected @entity0 to give himself up , but the standoff continued			2
at one point , a handgun was thrown from the window of the apartment , but the minister said the suspect had other weapons , as well as a car containing more arms near his apartment			0
@entity0 broke off communications with police late in the morning , @entity110 said , but started talking again several hours later , a police officer said			1
