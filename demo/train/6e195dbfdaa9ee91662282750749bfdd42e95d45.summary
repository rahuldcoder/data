when astronaut @entity1 uttered what became one of the best - known -- and most debated -- quotes in all of history , he actually might have said it exactly the way he meant to , not the way people heard it			1
after @entity1 lowered his left foot from the landing craft to the surface of the moon , people watching around the world heard him call it " one small step for man			1
" both he and @entity20 initially insisted that he said " one small step for a man , " and now a new and novel study on the much - analyzed quote backs him up			1
researchers from @entity26 and @entity32 have " bolstered @entity1 's side of the story , " said @entity25 , an @entity26 assistant professor of communicative sciences and disorders			2
after becoming the first person to step on the moon in 1969 , @entity1 said what was heard as : " that 's one small step for man ; one giant leap for mankind			1
" you can hear the audio here			0
later , as @entity20 explains , @entity1 said he had intended to say " a man , " and thought he had			1
but he agreed that " a " did not seem audible in the recording			0
numerous intense studies have been carried out over the years , using high - tech equipment , all in the effort to discover whether he had indeed uttered that one little sound			1
in 2006 , @entity48 said he had found the " a " in a study of the audio waveform , @entity20 explains			2
then , " more rigorous analyses of the transmission were undertaken by people with professional experience with audio waveforms and , most importantly , audio spectrograms			0
none of these analyses support @entity60 's conclusion			0
" first man on the moon gave rare interview until now , perhaps			2
the @entity26 and @entity32 researchers took what they call a novel approach : studying how people from @entity1 's native central @entity68 pronounce " for " and " for a. " the team studied recordings of 40 people in @entity73 , near @entity1 's native town of @entity75			2
they found numerous examples of " for " and " for a " sounding similar			0
their results suggest that it is entirely possible that @entity1 said what he claimed , though evidence indicates that people are statistically more likely to hear ' for man ' instead of ' for a man ' on the recording , " @entity26 said in a news release			1
" we feel we 've partially vindicated him , " @entity25 said			0
" but we 'll most likely never know for sure exactly what he said			0
" recalling @entity1 's " life well - lived "			0

@entity1 was heard around the world calling the first moon walk a " small step for man "
he contended he had said " a man "
numerous studies have been carried out
a new study of speech patterns near his *hometown* found he may have said " for a "
