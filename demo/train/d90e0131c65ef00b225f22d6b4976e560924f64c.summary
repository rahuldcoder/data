, i left @entity9 to start @entity10 , a @entity11 - based non-profit with a bold mission -- to change the course of chronic disease			1
this was the beginning of a very personal journey for me , and the expression of a heartfelt desire to gather like - minded people and make a meaningful contribution to global health			0
at the core of our work is compelling science			0
according to the @entity4 , 80 % of heart disease , 80 % of diabetes and 40 % of cancers can be prevented by increasing physical activity , healthy eating and avoiding tobacco			1
at @entity10 , we believe deeply in the power of prevention			1
globally , we shine a spotlight on @entity8 -- heart disease , diabetes , cancers and chronic lung diseases -- and advocate for their prevention			1
in @entity42 we are implementing programs for diabetes prevention through lifestyle changes			1
there we launched @entity47 , our flagship program , a groundbreaking one - million - person diabetes prevention @entity51 effort conducted with @entity52 -- and an ongoing @entity53			1
over the last two years , we have collected a group of committed , passionate individuals -- including advisors like @entity57 -- and immersed ourselves in the difficult task of moving hearts and minds			0
our approach is to leverage strong science , medical and non-medical experts , public - private partnerships and modern technology to make measurable public health impact -- improving lives and livelihoods around the world			0
why @entity8 ? why @entity42 ? two out of three deaths in the world today are caused by @entity8 , some 80 % of them in developing countries			1
by year 2030 , @entity8 are estimated to cause more than five times the number of deaths from @entity75 , @entity76 , malaria and maternal and child mortality , combined			0
and the cost is staggering -- projected to be trillions of dollars in lost productivity over the next two decades			0
ncds have become a world crisis , changing the face of global health as we know it , demanding urgent political action and international co-operation			0
twenty percent of @entity42 's people have one chronic disease , and 10 % more than one			1
diabetes ( which runs in my father 's family ) is at catastrophic levels in @entity42 , where more than 50 million people live with the disease , and 1 million die from it each year			1
and @entity42 get diabetes on average 10 years earlier than their @entity101 counterparts			1
half of @entity42 ( more than half a billion people ) is under 25 years of age			1
as these young people get into their 30s and 40s and start getting diabetes in large numbers , the public health impact will be huge			2
our immediate goals in @entity42 are : 1 ) educate at least 1,000,000 @entity42 in diabetes prevention			1
2 ) execute and measure the effectiveness of interventions targeting consumers , schools and the workplace			0
3 ) bring about behavior changes proven to prevent diabetes in 50,000 people			2
and , we want to use what we learn to establish a scalable model for prevention of chronic diseases			2
@entity126 is key to achieving these goals			1
in september 2011 , at the @entity128 , we pledged to reach one million people from all over @entity42 over a period of two years , and to measure the effectiveness of our program			1
we 're sending text messages on diabetes and its prevention twice a week in 12 languages , providing six months of content at no charge to the consumer			2
we were joined by many partners in this big , bold effort - @entity52 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 -- and we thank them for partnering with an unknown ( we prefer the epithet " small but mighty " ) non-profit			0
with @entity142 , we developed diabetes awareness and prevention messages with a strong emphasis on science and proven principles of behavior change			1
we then reviewed them for cultural relevancy and technical accuracy with our @entity158 , a group of medical , health promotion and consumer communications experts			0
to date , we 've reached 100,000 consumers , and are on track to reach one million by next year			0
see a 1 minute video on @entity165 's work in @entity42 we are measuring results , so that we can correct course as needed and improve program effectiveness			2
this is no pilot -- we have completed the first phase of research with 750 consumers , and will be conducting more rigorous evaluation of behavior change			0
what is the promise of @entity177 ? we want to evaluate the effectiveness of @entity177 in both urban and rural @entity42 , and then expand our program to include other @entity8 such as heart disease , etc. ultimately , we wish to establish a scalable chronic disease prevention model			1
there are many reasons why we are genuinely excited about the promise of @entity126 : 1 ) mobile phones have a broad reach in the developing world -- some 75 % of the mobile subscriptions today are in the developing world			2
in @entity42 alone there are more than 900 million mobile subscribers			2
2 ) and it is the same developing countries that are hardest hit by @entity8 -- @entity51 could provide helpful and cost effective solutions			0
3 ) initial results from the @entity196 phase of @entity126 research are encouraging : overall , consumers reacted very favorably to the messages and found them clear , compelling and useful			2
eighty - five percent said they would be willing to share the messages -- we find that extremely promising			0
if effective , @entity47 could be replicated in other countries , and evolve into a global solution to the @entity8 crisis			0
developing countries , already burdened by the scourge of infectious diseases and maternal mortality , are finding it hard to grapple with the growing burden of @entity8 , and would likely find such an approach affordable and easy to adopt. the @entity214 on @entity8 adopted unanimously at the @entity215 in september 2011 by all countries , asked for a " whole of society " approach to tackle @entity8 , one of the greatest health and development challenges of the century			0
we at @entity10 agree -- ncds are our collective responsibility to fix			0
@entity126 and the rest of our work , including our global advocacy for @entity8 prevention , are this one @entity232 's response to that call to action			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity236 .			0

@entity10 's key focus in @entity42 is diabetes prevention through lifestyle changes
80 % of diabetes can be prevented by increasing physical activity , healthy eating and avoiding tobacco .
twenty percent of @entity42 's people have one chronic disease , and 10 % more than one .
@entity126 hopes to send diabetes awareness and prevention messages to one million people by next year .
