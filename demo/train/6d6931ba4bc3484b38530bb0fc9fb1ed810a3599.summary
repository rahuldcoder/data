the streets run rampant with stylish people taking pictures of stylish people taking pictures			0
everyone is looking at everyone else -- tweeting , facebooking and instagramming their favorite looks of the night			0
one can judge the success of their ensemble by the number of times they 're asked for a photograph			0

@entity117 , standing out in @entity122 with a bright yellow blazer and black cloche hat , said the event 's appeal lies in its accessibility : it 's an opportunity for the general public to connect with the seemingly intimidating fashion community on a more personal level			1
as @entity133 , a 24 - year - old recent graduate from the @entity134 , strolls into the @entity136 store on @entity2 , she 's clearly in her element			2
