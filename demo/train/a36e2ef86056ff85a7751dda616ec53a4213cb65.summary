-- when the judge 's gavel fell , the future had been decided for the two teenagers convicted of rape in @entity6 , @entity7			1
@entity8 , 17 , and @entity9 , 16 , will spend at least a year in a juvenile correctional facility , although authorities could decide to keep them in custody until they turn 21			1
both must undergo treatment and will have to register as sex offenders			1
for the 16 - year - old victim , the next steps are n't so clear			2
she was raped last summer at a party ; witnesses posted images of the assault on social media			1
the case has garnered national attention and sparked a conversation about rape in @entity29			1
" my family and i are hopeful that we can put this horrible ordeal behind us , " the victim 's mother said monday			2
" we need and deserve to focus on our daughter 's future			2
" every two minutes , someone in the @entity29 is sexually assaulted , according to the @entity38			1
every survivor responds differently to rape , says @entity41 , vice president of victim services for @entity38 , the nation 's largest anti-sexual - violence organization			2
emotions run the gamut from fear to anger to guilt			2
" it 's such a violent and personal crime , " @entity48 said			2
" it 's not somebody just breaking into your house			2
it 's somebody assaulting the most private part of you			2
having that be public , especially as a minor , can be traumatic			2
" victims of sexual assault are three times more likely to suffer from depression and six times more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder , according to @entity38			1
some try to self - medicate with alcohol or drugs			2
many have trouble with intimacy and forming trusting relationships			1
one of the most common issues survivors face is blaming themselves for the assault , @entity48 says			1
a lot of that has to do with our culture : @entity48 says she sees rape cases like the one in @entity6 every day that are n't taken seriously			0
" a lot of times , it gets chalked up to , ' oh , kids will drink , and things will happen , ' " she said			0
" but ... sexual assault is sexual assault			1
and it does n't matter if the victim was drinking or using substances			0
the fact is that something was done to her that she did n't want to be done			0
and i think that 's the conversation we really need to talk about			0
" the victim in the @entity6 case has endured hostility from the attackers ' supporters			0
although mainstream media have kept her name private , it 's obvious she 's well - known in the small @entity7 community			1
defense attorneys questioned the victim 's character on the stand , asking witnesses about her alcohol consumption that night and what she told them the next morning regarding the assault			1
they also attempted to bring the victim 's past into the trial , but the judge did not allow the line of questioning			0
the character attacks were n't over after the verdict was read			0
shortly after the trial concluded , two teenage girls were accused of making threats against the victim on @entity127 , according to @entity129 @entity128			0
one of the girls was charged tuesday with one misdemeanor count of aggravated menacing for threatening the victim 's life			0
this kind of personal persecution is a big fear for victims , says @entity139 , a licensed professional counselor with the @entity141 , a large nonprofit crisis center in @entity142 , @entity143			1
more than half of sexual assaults are not reported to the police ; experts estimate that 97 % of rapists do n't spend a day in jail			1
" when we have a high - profile case that gets reported and we see the victim be re-victimized ... it makes it all the more difficult for victims to come forward , " @entity150 said			1
" survivors are faced with that difficult decision : am i ready and willing to be in a courtroom and face this and talk through all the details again in such a public forum ? it 's a lot to ask			1
" @entity150 says a guilty verdict often offers survivors a sense of validation -- that someone , at least , believes them			1
" does it provide closure for a victim ? i 've never seen it provide closure , " she said			0
" it 's just a step in the healing process			0
" that process never ends , @entity150 says			0
photos of an attack that are posted online can make it even more difficult , acting as triggers to bring back painful memories each time they resurface			0
" as hard as they try to delete or erase those images , five , 10 , 15 years down the road , they 'll be notified that it 's popped up again and in some ways they feel like they 're reliving that assault , " @entity48 agreed			1
how a victim 's support network responds can have a big impact on the long - term recovery for that survivor			0
" the first thing that loved ones should do is believe what the victim has said , " @entity48 said			0
" although we know it 's natural to try to figure out exactly how this happened , we encourage loved ones to avoid using ' why ' questions , because victims often perceive that as blaming them for what happened			1
" @entity208 and friends should also recognize that each victim needs to recover at his or her own pace , she says			0
they should provide love and support without forcing them to do something that they 're not prepared to do yet			0
survivors can contact @entity38 through their @entity38 or go to @entity220			1
many local crisis centers offer individual / family counseling services and support groups			0
rape is n't something survivors get over , @entity48 says			1
but counseling and a solid support system will help them move on			0
" although they may never be able to forget that this happened , it does n't have to define who they are or the choices that they make			0
" @entity0 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 contributed to this report .			0
