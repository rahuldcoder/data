-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 is to be tried on charges of having sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of power			1
. a judge in @entity8 has ruled a fast - tracked trial before three judges should begin in the city on april 6			0
the case is the latest in a long - running series of legal wrangles featuring the scandal - plagued politician and billionaire media mogul			0
what is @entity1 accused of ? prosecutors allege that @entity1 paid for sex with a 17 - year - old nightclub dancer , @entity21 , nicknamed @entity22			1
they also claim he abused his position when he intervened to get her released from the jail where she was being held on charges of theft			2
in @entity2 , the age of consent is 14 , and it is not illegal to pay for sex			0
however , paying for sex with a minor ( under 18 ) is a crime , and can be punished by up to three years in jail			0
@entity1 has said the dancer had been introduced as a 24 - year - old			1
is this the only legal issue facing @entity1 ? no. the 74 - year - old @entity2 pm , currently serving his third term in office , also faces charges of bribing @entity43 lawyer @entity42 to secure favorable testimony in legal cases			1
his trial , suspended last spring after he was granted temporary immunity , resumes next month			0
@entity48 denied receiving bribes and his conviction in the case was overturned last year			0
he has survived a series of political , corruption and sex scandals over the years , involving allegations of embezzlement , tax fraud and bribery			1
@entity1 has been tried on at least 17 charges since he was first elected prime minister in 1994 , but none of the cases have resulted in lasting convictions ; several were overturned on appeal			1
he has always denied any wrongdoing , and had previously claimed immunity from prosecution , though a 2008 law granting him this was overturned the following year			0
how has he reacted to the claims ? @entity1 insists he has never paid for sex -- " not even once in my life " -- and says any suggestion he did so is " degrading for my dignity			1
" both he and @entity76 , who is now 18 , deny ever having had sex with one another			0
but the young woman 's former roommate told investigators that @entity76 confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier			0
@entity1 says he did call the police on @entity76 's behalf , but denies this was an abuse of power			1
the billionaire media magnate and football club owner says the allegations against him are simply political mudslinging			1
his lawyers have called the investigation " absurd and groundless " and a " grave interference " in @entity1 's private life			2
so what happens now ? judge @entity95 has ruled that @entity1 should face trial on the two charges -- having sex with an underage prostitute , and abuse of power			1
the court case , before three judges , is due to begin in @entity8 on april 6			0
@entity1 's lawyers have previously argued that courts in @entity8 do not have jurisdiction in the case -- because of where the alleged crimes were committed -- or the authority to try a prime minister			2
has the scandal damaged @entity1 's reputation ? yes and no. long - running scandals , a playboy lifestyle and a series of well - publicized gaffes have opened the @entity2 pm up to ridicule			2
there are signs @entity2 are tiring of the constant focus on his personal indiscretions , and many doubt the situation will improve			0
" should he resign ? they all should resign ; we are a joke			0
it is the country of jokes , " @entity128 , a 22 - year - old coffee shop assistant in @entity129 told @entity0 recently			1
thousands of @entity2 took to the streets in cities across the country -- and in @entity135 and @entity136 -- on february 12 in protest at @entity1 's alleged behaviour towards women			2
a poll in the @entity2 daily newspaper , @entity141 , found 56 percent of those questioned no longer want @entity1 as @entity143			1
a tv poll found 61 percent felt he should resign , but 59 percent believed the government would continue as it is until its mandate ends in 2013			0
@entity1 has survived two votes of no confidence in recent months , and while his personal approval ratings have been dented , his party , the @entity147 , still enjoys widespread support in @entity2 .			2

prosecutors claim @entity1 paid for sex with 17 - year - old nightclub dancer
@entity143 denies allegations , says investigation is political mudslinging
@entity1 investigated on at least 17 charges since he was first elected in 1994
