-- city life can be stressful			1
@entity3 life can be hair - pullingly , nail - bitingly , heart - attackingly stressful			1
so leaving the city once in a while is essential			1
" i love the diversity and anonymity of @entity3 , " says management consultant @entity7 , who moved to @entity3 from a sleepy village in northern @entity9 17 years ago			1
" people have such drive here and it 's the hip and happening place to be in @entity16			1
but it 's quite a pressurized environment and this forces you to get out when you can			1
" you need to unwind in big sky country			1
" here are four places to do just that			1
@entity23 some @entity24 turn their noses up at this game reserve , saying it 's like a zoo			2
that 's because it has tarred roads and is only a couple hours drive away			1
but it 's pretty big ( 220 square miles ) , malaria - free , has the @entity34 and the animals are definitely wild , judging by the bull elephant that charged me last time i visited			2
the best way to appreciate the park is to pack a few cool ones and some meat and start the day with a fry - up at one of the many braais provided			2
it 's very do - able to spend just a day at the park , located west of @entity48			2
there are gravel roads to escape the crowds and although guided safari drives are available it 's more fun to drive yourself			2
you 'd be pretty unlucky not to see some impressive animals			2
@entity16 are generous about sharing sightings so if someone waves you down , they may want to point out where to go			2
accommodation ranges from camping to luxury lodges			2
if you like being in nature but not roughing it , an executive safari tent at @entity65 ( @entity65 ; @entity66 ; +27 14 555 1045 ) is around @entity67 ( $ 160 ) in peak season			2
or for a surreal experience , @entity69 ( @entity69 ; +27 14 557 1000 ) borders the park			2
the themed resort is @entity16 's @entity73 and takes kitsch to a new level -- but can be pretty fun			2
@entity23 @entity78 mountains @entity16 refer to this range as simply the @entity81 ( mountains ) -- as if there were really only one that counts			1
depending on where you go it takes three to five hours to drive here from @entity3 , but it feels like another world			1
with peaks up to 3,500 meters high , the @entity81 are one of the most spectacular mountain ranges in the world and where @entity24 come for a complete change			1
the contrast with city life could not be more stark , from the wide open spaces instead of electric fences and a slower rural pace of life instead of constant rush			2
the @entity101 are closest to @entity3 and bounded by an eight - kilometer high rock escarpment			1
to lie on the grass gazing up at the escarpment from @entity106 ( @entity103 036 438 6411 ; from @entity109 ( $ 84.50 ) ) , a hutted camp in its shadow , is an uplifting experience			0
there are day hikes of varying lengths from here up the @entity116 waterfall			0
avoid the @entity117 when driving to the northern @entity118			0
an 18 - kilometer section is still unfinished and avoiding the potholes and navigating through the frequent mists while trying not to drop off the edge is terrifying			0
the @entity123 encompasses some of the most challenging peaks such as @entity125 and @entity126			0
detailed maps and preferably guides are needed for hiking here -- snow , floods , arduous climbs and snakes make it a serious prospect			0
@entity125 is popular with @entity16 families and has fantastic facilities , but the decor is decidedly 1980s			0
you can stay in a dorm ( from @entity141 ( $ 14 ) ) or a traditional rondavel ( from @entity143 ( $ 23.50 ) ) at @entity144 ( @entity145 ; @entity146 ; +27 36 4681202 ) , which has a great asset in the form of owner and former mountaineer @entity152 @entity153 @entity155 green fields , cows , drizzle and mist			1
not @entity159 , but the @entity153 three hours drive south of @entity3 in @entity9			1
the area was originally settled by @entity162 farmers			0
the dairy cows lead a happy existence here , making for a delicious cream tea			0
the @entity153 are lovely to visit in autumn or winter , when you can warm up around the fire after a stroll over the hills and eat and drink in one of the many excellent hotels			1
staying at @entity172 ( @entity172 ; @entity173 , @entity174 ; +27 33 263 2713 ) is like being in the middle of a posh @entity159 country estate			0
it 's also a working stud farm , housing famous stallions from racing history , which you can visit on a tour			1
the restaurant is one of the best in @entity16 , a blend of classical and inventive use of local ingredients			0
the @entity187 is n't that easy to navigate , mainly due to the ridiculous ye olde worlde names given to places that tell you nothing about what they offer			0
there are several interesting micro-breweries and craft shops along the way			0
tsonga shoes are locally made and benefit rural communities			0
( they 're also the most comfortable shoes i 've ever worn in my life			0
) the @entity153 are a convenient base to visit the famous battlefields around the towns of @entity207 and @entity208			1
it may seem like boring history but the stories behind the battles between @entity162 and @entity214 warriors in the green foothills are spell - binding			0
@entity216 you 'd describe this ancient mountain range as pleasant , rather than awesome like the @entity78			1
but it 's under two hours from @entity3 and a great place to breathe fresh air and recharge			1
there 's a 120 kilometer - long mountain range to explore , as well as forests , streams and @entity226 , which borders the @entity216 in the east			1
i only have one moan , and that 's the lack of public walking trails			0
the only way around it is to join a guided walk on private land , pay for day access or stay somewhere you can hike			0
you can burn off some stress walking at @entity239 ( @entity239 ; @entity240 ; +27 14 534 0114 ) nature reserve and cool off by jumping into the clear rock pools			0
this is also a lovely place to stay , either camping ( @entity244 ( $ 9.40 ) ) or in a log cabin ( @entity246 ( $ 42.30 ) )			1
i also like @entity247 ( @entity248 ; @entity249 ; 014 576 1035 ) , right at the foot of the mountains and that does simple but delicious food			1
@entity255 campsite ( @entity255 ; @entity256 ; +27 82 555 9681 ) has lots of shady spots			0
though many @entity16 view camping as an excuse for a party and it can get pretty rowdy			0
the @entity262 ( @entity262 ; @entity263 ; +27 ( 0 ) 14 535 0150 ) is not for those with a fear of heights			0
you slide down cables between platforms perched high on the rock face ( @entity271 ( $ 46.50 )			0
there 's also a fantastic view of the mountains from a hot air balloon , operated by several companies			1
@entity277 is a wine , food , culture and travel journalist based in @entity16 .			0

the @entity78 mountains are just a few hours from @entity3 , but feel like another world
the @entity153 are a convenient base to visit famous battlefields around the towns of @entity207 and @entity208
@entity216 is a great place to breathe fresh air and mess about on the river
