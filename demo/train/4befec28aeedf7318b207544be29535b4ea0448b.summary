all you might feel is someone brush by you and a slight pin prick			2
but very quickly you would be suffering muscle paralysis followed by suffocation			0
you would be dead within a very short period of time			0
this is the deadly effect of just one of the weapons found on a failed @entity12 assassin last year on the busy streets of @entity14 , now shown exclusively to @entity15			1
disguised to look like a @entity18 ballpoint pen , it contains a poison needle and is practically impossible to identify as a weapon			1
the second pen shoots a poison - filled bullet which penetrates the skin and releases the toxin and the third weapon is a flashlight , loaded with up to three bullets			1
they all look completely innocuous but all three will kill			0
an individual willing to be identified only as an " investigation official " showed @entity15 the weapons , pointing out the flashlight as the most significant find			0
" this flashlight is new , " the man familiar with @entity12 assassination devices said			1
" i 've never seen this weapon			0
if you look at the front , there are three holes , there was a bullet in each hole and here is the trigger			0
this is currently loaded and dangerous , two bullets remain			2
" the third bullet had been fired by investigation authorities to test the weapon			0
it was accurate and deadly			0
the would - be assassin who was carrying these devices was arrested on his way to kill his target			1
that target was anti-north @entity12 activist , @entity57 , who has since been given round - the - clock police protection by @entity60 authorities			1
we showed @entity62 the footage of the weapons intended for him			2
" you 'd notice a gun , but these weapons are so innocuous , you can easily kill someone , i 'd be dead immediately			0
" @entity62 says he will continue to send @entity73 propaganda leaflets across the border in balloons , a practice which has angered the regime , sparking threats of military retaliation			1
he was aware he was at the top of @entity12 's hit list			2
@entity62 had been in contact with the would - be assassin , named only as @entity84 , as @entity84 had expressed interest in funding his activism			1
he was on his way to meet him when the @entity88 intervened and stopped him			0
it was at that meeting @entity84 was believed to have planned to kill @entity62 , according to @entity60 authorities			1
@entity84 was convicted in april and sentenced to four years in prison			0
" i did n't believe they 'd try and kill me on the crowded streets of @entity14 , i thought the @entity88 was over-reacting , " @entity62 said			2
he now knows they saved his life but is also convinced that it will not be the last attempt on his life .			1
