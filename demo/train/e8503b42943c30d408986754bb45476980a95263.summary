@entity0 -- major decisions abroad for president @entity3 , a peek inside @entity6 ' new campaign playbook , and reminders of how important @entity8 and @entity9 are in national politics -- just some of the topics that emerged from our trip around the " @entity15 " table			1
@entity16 , a digital extra from @entity18 's @entity17 shows new signs that @entity21 supporters are ready to get more aggressive			2
@entity23 's next play : @entity9 's @entity25 battle the @entity23 continues to be a major player in the 2014 fight for control of the @entity25 , with its next move to be a multimillion - dollar ad buy for @entity32 @entity31 in @entity9 's @entity25 contest			1
@entity31 is running against @entity35 rep. @entity34			0
the @entity9 play comes on the heels of a @entity23 ad buy in @entity39 featuring a @entity41 testimonial for @entity43 @entity25 candidate @entity42			1
with 58 days to @entity45 , one reason @entity32 feel good about their odds of capturing the @entity25 majority is the fact that @entity9 and @entity39 , two states president @entity3 won handily twice , remain within reach for the @entity43			1
inside @entity6 ' new playbook @entity52 of the @entity53 spoke with insiders in the @entity43 and they say that @entity6 is shaking up his entire campaign			1
" he brought in @entity57 , who got to @entity58 this weekend , a consultant from @entity59 , and they got rid of @entity61 , @entity6 ' longtime confidant and campaign manager , " said @entity52			1
" and look for them this week to try and define ( @entity65 ) @entity64 , the independent candidate			0
" who is behind that effort to define @entity6 ' opponent ? @entity52 reports that @entity70 protege @entity69 is coming in to help with opposition research and get @entity6 back on track			1
@entity8 gets help from ambitious democrats @entity18 's @entity75 took us inside sen. @entity78 's strategy of turning the national political importance of his state , @entity8 , into a boon for local political causes			1
@entity21 , he reports , is in discussions to raise money soon for the @entity85			0
@entity87 gov. @entity86 and vice president @entity88 already have attended fund - raisers of late			0
" the reason why that 's important for @entity78 is that he needs his candidates in this november 's location , local candidates , to win , " said @entity75			1
" because if they do , his chances of survival in 2016 really improve			0
" the key race in @entity78 's election - day calculations is the lieutenant governor 's race			1
@entity78 is concerned that @entity99 gov. @entity99 may try to grab his @entity25 seat in 2016			1
the thinking is that if a @entity103 lieutenant governor is elected this year , @entity99 wo n't want to leave the @entity104 in two years and hand it over to a @entity105			0
@entity43 leadership on ' pins and needles ' over budget showdown will another budget deadline at the end of this month lead to another government shutdown ? @entity114 of the @entity115 reports that no one expects a shutdown , but the @entity43 leadership is on pins and needles about being able to get the continuing resolution passed			1
" they do n't have a game plan for how they are going to get @entity127 conservatives to fund the government , " said ball			0
" as we mentioned on immigration , it 's riled up the right and emboldened a lot of conservatives to make demands			2
the @entity135 is also a really tough issue and the leadership has signaled they 're going to try to get it reauthorized in the continuing resolution			2
" so there may be fireworks on @entity142 this month -- stay tuned			0
the ' @entity143 ' is n't going anywhere @entity145 of the @entity146 shared smart insights suggesting the " @entity143 " is likely to carry over into the next administration -- even if the newly announced ceasefire in @entity150 holds			0
" the problem is that that does n't end the story ; it does n't solve the fundamental issues , " said @entity145			0
" that 's why what i think we 're going to see is what we call ' frozen conflict , ' as we see elsewhere around the @entity163 , in which it remains a continuing set of tensions and frictions basically for now and the next few years to come			2
" @entity166 gets a little help from her friends we knew the onetime @entity170 had morphed into a pro-hillary @entity166 super pac			0
but after a relatively quiet 2014 , @entity18 's @entity17 shared reporting that the group is prepared to get more aggressive , meaning prepared to inject itself into the 2016 @entity103 primary competition			2
" it was made very clear at a private meeting of people involved with it several weeks ago that they are prepared to spend in the primary to defend her , " said @entity17			0
" that means this is much more like what we saw with @entity41 and the super pac that went after @entity185 in a devastating way in the 2012 election cycle , and less like something that 's just on hold to attack the @entity32 nominee			2
