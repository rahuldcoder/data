nurse @entity0 says it 's her right to roam outside her home , but leaders in @entity4 warn she could be a threat to public welfare			2
yes , @entity0 recently treated people with @entity8 in @entity9 , but she has no symptoms of the disease , and has twice tested negative			1
" to put me in prison is just inhumane , " @entity0 said about being placed into an involuntary quarantine after she landed last week at the @entity14 , @entity15 , airport after working in @entity16			0
" i just feel like fear is winning right now , and when fear wins , everyone loses			0
" @entity15 gov. @entity21 disagreed			0
citing public safety , officials had @entity0 spend more than 65 hours in mandatory quarantine outside a hospital before she was released and transported to her home in @entity4			0
@entity21 on @entity8 policy : ' we 're not moving an inch ' officials in @entity4 also disagree with the nurse			1
gov. @entity32 says he will " exercise the full extent of his authority allowable by law " to keep her away from public places			0
a police cruiser trailed @entity0 and her boyfriend as they took an hourlong bicycle ride through rural @entity4 thursday -- a move the governor said was meant to protect the nurse			0
the showdown between @entity0 and @entity4 officials strikes at a larger dilemma about what health workers ought to do when they return home from fighting the unprecedented @entity8 outbreak in @entity9 , especially when the doctors and nurses show no symptoms of the deadly virus			1
it 's an emotional debate that pits individual liberty against public safety , now elevated to a high public drama because @entity0 has been outspoken against a quarantine			2
" i 'm fighting for something much more than myself , " she said wednesday after emerging from the home where she had been staying			0
" there are so many aid workers coming back			2
it scares me to think how they 're going to be treated and how they 're going to feel			0
" raw emotions @entity8 's arrival to @entity74 soil this year has caused a visceral reaction among some @entity74 who advocate quarantines as a prudent vigilance against a disease with no established cure			1
but medical experts say that reaction is merely fear , and they explain that an individual without the virus ' symptoms is no public threat at all			0
that does n't satisfy some @entity74 who demand a higher precaution : they want health care workers to be in quarantine for 21 days , the incubation period for the ebola virus			1
they cite how dr. @entity91 , 33 , a @entity93 physician , moved freely about @entity94 for days until he developed @entity8			1
@entity91 just returned from treating @entity8 patients in @entity96			1
@entity15 's 21 - day quarantine policy drew sharp criticism from @entity0 , who described it as a " knee - jerk reaction by politicians to @entity8			1
" @entity102 and @entity103 announced similar 21 - day quarantine orders this week on anyone who has had contact with an @entity8 patient in affected areas of @entity9			1
it 's an approach @entity4 's top health official says she wants the state to take -- and an idea that one of @entity0 's neighbors said he supports			2
" why she 's being so defiant , i 'm not sure , " neighbor @entity116 said , " but it 's causing consternation here , and people are trying to ask why she wo n't honor it			2
it 's a simple thing : stay in the quarantine until it 's over , and we 're good			2
" president @entity126 tried to quash that public sentiment this week by inviting to the @entity128 a group of @entity74 health workers who worked in @entity132 ebola zones			1
after being in direct contact with those non-symptomatic workers , @entity126 reiterated how there 's no public danger when a health worker does n't have symptoms of the virus			1
" we do n't react to our fears , but instead , we respond with common sense and skill and courage			2
that 's the best of our history -- not fear , not hysteria , not misinformation , " @entity126 said			1
but in a move that seemed to contradict the @entity128 , the @entity148 this week put 30 @entity74 soldiers in quarantine -- or " controlled monitoring " -- in @entity153 after they were stationed in @entity8 - stricken @entity9			1
@entity155 major general speaks to @entity156 from inside @entity8 quarantine high stakes at stake in the quarantine debate is the fight against @entity8 itself , advocates say			1
specifically , it 's the ability of health care workers who fight @entity8 at its source to return immediately to their private and professional lives			1
a 21 - day quarantine would discourage this rare pool of labor from taking on such hazardous duty in @entity9 , advocates say			1
if there are fewer doctors and nurses on the @entity8 front , there 's a likelihood that the epidemic in @entity9 could spread , experts say			1
the rights of these health workers once they return home is governed by @entity74 guidelines and health laws that ultimately favor states over the federal government			1
the federal @entity189 now requires greater symptom monitoring of doctors and nurses returning from @entity9 , but stops short of requiring any type of quarantine , according to new rules implemented this week			1
states have the power to exceed those @entity189 guidelines , and some do			1
" we have a federal system in this country in which states are given significant authority for governing their constituents			2
that is certainly true when it comes to public safety and public health , " @entity128 spokesman @entity203 said this week			0
" what we believe is important -- and i think this is a view that is shared by governors and local officials across the country -- is that these kinds of policies should be driven by science and the best scientific advice that is available			0
" the humanitarian group @entity93 , for which @entity0 worked while in @entity9 , condemned " blanket forced quarantine for health care workers returning from @entity8 affected countries , " the organization said this week			1
" such a measure is not based upon established medical science , " the group said			0
the group supports " scientifically grounded monitoring " for homeward - bound aid workers , which " is in accordance with the recommendations of public health experts			1
" the virus is spread through the direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infectious person -- that is , someone who shows symptoms of the virus -- and with surfaces and materials contaminated with those fluids			0
people remain infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus , and men can still transmit the virus through breast milk and semen for up to seven weeks after they recover from the disease , the @entity242 says			0
how the ebola virus spreads division among supporters to demonstrate how the @entity0 case can divide even the most sympathetic supporters , the freelance @entity254 cameraman who was a former @entity8 patient endorsed @entity0 's declarations that she has a human and constitutional right to exit her home and roam the outdoors			1
but would @entity263 make that choice himself in the aftermath of his recovery from @entity8 ? not entirely , he said			1
even though the cameraman is now free of the virus , he recently chose not to visit a @entity270 gathering because he did n't want to provoke public anxiety at a jack - o ' - lantern exhibition attended by more 8,000 people			2
" you know , i just worry about making people uncomfortable			0
i think i need a couple of weeks out of the hospital where i really can say , look , i 've been fine for three weeks , " @entity263 told @entity156			0
@entity263 : ebola ' more intense than anything ' @entity263 's concern has a precedent : when @entity254 chief medical editor dr. @entity283 violated a precautionary 21 - day quarantine to reportedly obtain takeout food , she provoked public outrage			1
that anger was expressed on @entity283 's @entity289 page			2
" it is quite obvious that @entity283 is an arrogant and egotistical woman who has no concern / regard for anyone but herself , " one man wrote			0
" i hope this does n't just ' blow over ' in a month and @entity254 does n't allow you to return to your position as chief medical correspondent , " one woman wrote			0
@entity283 later apologized for how members of her team , which had visited @entity8 - infected @entity301 , " violated " quarantine guidelines			1
court challenge @entity304 , @entity4 's health commissioner , has said the process to seek a court order imposing a quarantine on @entity0 has already begun			1
it 's not entirely clear which side would win that court battle , partly because @entity8 is regarded as a menace with no established cure and partly because there 's no evidence that @entity0 has the disease , let alone a symptom suggesting it , experts say			1
under the @entity319 , states have the authority over public health issues , except at international airports and seaports , where the federal government has jurisdiction , said attorney @entity326 , who wrote @entity328 's quarantine laws			2
" we quarantine folks who have been exposed to a communicable disease , but who are not yet infected , " @entity326 said			0
" the goal is to try to keep people who have been exposed , who may or may not be sick , from infecting other people			0
and so there 's a sound basis for quarantine medically , but there 's a lot of debate about whether -- what @entity94 and @entity15 did was really appropriate			2
" science vs. politics @entity0 's attorneys contend there is no medical evidence that @entity0 has any sign of @entity8			1
she 's therefore no threat to society , her attorneys say			0
rather , @entity4 's effort to seek a mandatory quarantine is based on politics , not science , said one of @entity0 's attorneys , @entity356			2
" this should not be directed and led by the politicians			0
it should be led by the medical community , " @entity356 said			0
" the government ca n't take away your liberty unless there is a compelling basis for it			0
" the absence of any illness in @entity370 is among the more salient facets of the expected court case , said @entity156 legal analyst @entity367 said			0
" @entity4 has a law , like all states have law , that say people with contagious diseases can be forced in quarantine , " @entity367 said			0
" the legal question ... is whether her condition , in perfectly good health without symptoms , counts as something that is covered by the law			0
that is a hard legal question because judges usually defer to public health authorities about their sense of risk			0
" but here every scientific expert says that people without symptoms are not contagious , " @entity367 added			0
" i think this is going to be a very hard legal problem unless her lawyers and the state of @entity4 can work out some sort of compromise			0
" complete coverage on @entity8			2

nation struggles with how to handle workers returning from @entity9 's ebola zone
some states are ordering 21 - day quarantines for any returning workers
@entity126 and @entity189 discourage quarantines , seek to allay fears
at stake is the fight against @entity8 itself , advocates say
