-- months after @entity3 's deadly accident in @entity4 , @entity5 , in 2006 , i continued to look through the thousands of pages of official evidence to understand what happened			1
although this was my fifth airline accident investigation , no matter how many times i examined the documents , there simply was no egregious act leading up to the disaster 's key event : the airliner took off from the wrong runway			2
then it dawned on me -- and shook me to my core			2
as a captain flying the same type of aircraft in and out of the same airport , i could have had the same takeoff accident			0
this could have been me			0
this was not some troubled crew , but one that had been praised for their safety standards and passion for flying			0
while pouring over the accident " facts , " i could not help but notice how normal everything seemed early that morning			0
the documents painted the picture			0
this looked like any other morning i had experienced as an airline pilot			0
but yet , something was terribly wrong , we had just suffered the worst @entity43 airline accident in five years and 49 passengers and crew were dead			1
how would we ever put our finger on one item and identify it as the factor with which in its absence the accident would not have occurred ? how do we establish this one component as being more important in causation as compared to the others discovered ? and in the @entity43 we do this even if the evidence still does not support it			1
we do it because we have to , and the federal organization that investigates plane crashes , the @entity58 , has no choice			1
when @entity58 investigators are finished walking through the rubble and sifting through the broken parts , they analyze the results and offer up what -- for some people -- are palatable answers			1
these answers might include phrases such as " he failed to do this ... " or " she did not follow a procedure , " explanations that strip away the confusion and reveal a supposed weak link in an otherwise robust transportation system			0
these explanations satisfy our desire to understand how order can become disorder so quickly			0
these single cause explanations unfortunately read like who is to blame			2
when the @entity58 was created by @entity85 more than 40 years ago , lawmakers ordered them not to assign blame			1
but @entity85 did command the @entity58 to find a probable cause			1
however , using single , narrow explanations -- with qualifiers such as " failed to " or " did not " when aimed at a single incident or person -- does just that			2
single explanations fall short of answering a larger , perhaps more important question : why ? why did " he fail to do this ? " or " why did she not follow procedure " this is where the true lever for change firmly rests			1
the missed opportunity to truly understand the complexity of these events			0
as seen in the recent hearings surrounding last year 's crash landing of @entity109 , the complexity is evident and is painfully clear that you can not choose one thing to stand above the rest			1
you can not say that one item of interest was the most important at the expense of other causal roles taking a backseat			0
maybe some are more central to the final act moments to the event , but there is no metric for determining which event is the one that goes to the top of the list and everything takes a lesser role			0
why are we so convinced that we can ? in fact , sizable research into these events shows that it is simply wasted energy to try to do so			0
why are we so focused on trying to find that one elusive smoking gun when it is never really there ? this is why many countries no longer try			0
the @entity43 is one of the last industrialized nations that still tries to find a single cause to these complex transportation accidents			1
this is an impossible task left over from an outdated congressional mandate that has caused the @entity43 to lag behind in accident investigation			1
for example , in @entity148 , the @entity147 has done away with causal statements altogether			0
instead , it lists its findings and recommendations -- thus avoiding an artificially narrow focus on blaming a few things or people			0
it recognizes as do many other countries that it is a futile effort			0
after an accident last year , @entity148 's tsb chair @entity160 reported : " we hold by the theory that no accident is ever caused by one thing			2
it 's always a series of things , and it always involves an organization and how they operate			2
we need to look deeply into that			0
it never comes down to one individual			0
years ago when our congressional mandate was written , investigative methods were still in their infancy			2
additionally , over the past 20 years , increased regulatory oversight , improved engineering methods and better procedures to name a few have helped reduce the number of deadly airline accidents to its lowest in history			0
single factors by themselves do not " cause " safety			2
why would a single factor also be responsible for an accident ? so why do we continue to offer explanations to the traveling public at the expense of improving the larger system ? do we really believe that a single human decision could topple a safe transportation system ? fourteen years ago , a @entity195 of the @entity58 titled " safety in the @entity199 " specifically addressed the issue of single , probable cause			1
one recommendation said , " the @entity58 should move away from simplistic , one - line probable cause statements , and instead consistently adopt a comprehensive statement that reflects the reality that a modern aircraft accident is rarely the result of a single error or failure			1
" after the @entity210 accident , then - @entity58 board member @entity208 , who is the current @entity58 chairman , stated the same concern in a statement at the end of the accident report			1
" i do suggest that the @entity58 should explore other approaches to determining probable cause or causes as a way to refine our approach and if necessary , ask @entity85 to grant us the statutory relief needed to structure our probable cause findings to be more comprehensive			1
" it 's an idea that has been sitting around longer than the @entity225 report			2
what are we waiting for ? do we think these accidents will become less complex with time , or that our systems are so brittle that despite safeguards and resilience they will collapse with a single inevitable human error ? of course not			2
then why do we still try to find the one item that did ? i think the traveling @entity43 public deserves the same breadth of investigative findings that other world citizens are offered			1
if we hope to improve upon the currently stalled accident rate , we must -- like the rest of the world -- move beyond artificially narrowed construction of causation statements and truly see the events before us as they are instead of forcing them into an outdated congressional mandate of single cause			1
@entity85 , it 's your move			1

@entity3 investigator on crash that killed 49 : this could have been me
@entity255 says crash probes should cast wider net beyond a single factor
the @entity43 is one of the last industrialized nations that still does it , @entity255 says
@entity255 calls on @entity85 to change the @entity58 's mandate
