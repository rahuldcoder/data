-- @entity2 's answer to @entity3 went public on tuesday afternoon			1
for the past three months , @entity4 , the company 's social network , was available only to users who had been invited by the company or by friends who already had access to the site			1
" for the past 12 weeks we 've been in field trial , and during that time we 've listened and learned a great deal , " @entity2 's @entity11 , a senior vice president for engineering , said in a blog post			1
" we 're nowhere near done , but with the improvements we 've made so far we 're ready to move from field trial to beta , and introduce our 100th feature : open sign - ups			0
" this way anyone can visit google.com / + , join the project and connect with the people they care about			0
" the update comes as many people who use the site are questioning its value			0
" my @entity4 home page is worse than a ghost town			1
it does n't even feel haunted , " wrote @entity33 , a columnist at the @entity34			0
writing on the @entity37 blog @entity38 , @entity39 adds : " the stream of updates has basically run dry -- reduced to one buddy who regularly writes			0
my initial excitement about signing on and inviting people to join me has waned			0
nowadays , i apparently get tired just thinking about it			0
" i must be doing something wrong on @entity4 , " @entity47 , founder of the blog @entity47 , wrote on his @entity4 page			2
" it is n't ' worse than a ghost town ' for me			1
it 's active and pleasant , albeit lacking some of the initial rush			0
" introduced in late june , @entity4 gained an estimated 25 million users by early august , although the company has released no recent figures on its membership			2
by contrast , @entity3 has more than 750 million users , and @entity61 has more than 175 million			2
@entity2 continues to add features to its social network in an apparent effort to spur growth and further differentiate itself from @entity3 and @entity61			1
on tuesday , the company announced a few more , including : better search for topics and personalities on the site : " @entity4 search results include items that only you can see , so family updates are just as easy to find as international news , " the company says			2
" on - air " hangouts : @entity2 's group video - chat feature , called hangouts , has helped it stand out from @entity3 , which does not have a similar tool			1
now users can broadcast these group chats to the public : " the setup is simple enough : just start a normal hangout , and you 'll have the option to broadcast and record your session			0
once you 're ' @entity95 , ' up to nine others can join your hangout ( as usual ) , and anyone can watch your live broadcast , " @entity2 's blog post says			1
@entity99 : these video chats now work on smartphones running @entity2 's @entity103 2.3 operating systems			1
support for the @entity105 is coming soon , @entity2 says			2
to promote the new hangouts features , @entity2 will host an @entity107 with rapper will.i.am on wednesday			0
what do you think ? now that @entity4 is public , will you join ? or is yet another social network too many ? let us know in the comments , or , if you 're so inclined , join a conversation about this on my @entity4 page .			1
