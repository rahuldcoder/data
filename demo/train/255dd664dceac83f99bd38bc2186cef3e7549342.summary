@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 founder @entity3 is looking to " digital hippies " as a potential theme for his next conference			1
the @entity9 entrepreneur runs the biggest tech gathering in @entity11 and he 's cautious to firm up a tagline too early			0
but when @entity2 caught up with him at the @entity13 in @entity0 , which he has attended for 11 years , he revealed what 's on his mind			2
why @entity0 matters in social media age @entity18 is seeing a trend of entrepreneurs who reject money , fame and power -- they just want to be happy			1
taking inspiration from events such as @entity29 's art and music festival " @entity31 , " which he attended for the first time in 2012 , @entity3 told @entity2 digital hippies are : " vegan , they do n't drink alcohol , they want to know where their food comes from , they are trying to go slow when we are going fast			1
" he referenced @entity45 's @entity44 and @entity47 's @entity46 as examples of those who began business as digital hippies			1
digital hippies are creating a sharing economy -- one that includes creations like @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 -- without a focus on exchanging cash			1
at burning man , @entity18 " took $ 500 and came back with $ 500			2
" the event , packed full of successful entrepreneurs , changed how he saw the world , @entity3 said			1
" it is a little crazy			0
" @entity65 : @entity11 is open for business @entity3 said the theme may be a bit risky , and he 's a " little scared " it will scare his sponsors			1
although " @entity72 " seems a good tag , he added			0
@entity73 hippies are not the only trend on his radar			1
the return of hardware is another			2
in the world of apps , hardware can be unattractive for investors			2
but @entity3 points to the ability of hardware creations to entirely disrupt supply chains			1
" we build websites , then apps , and now we are back to hardware , " @entity3 said			2
@entity91 printing , for example , could revolutionize the way we buy products			0
" you need a knife and fork ? you can print it			0
a glass ? you can print it			0
" @entity0 , a gathering of the world 's elite , could not be further from the idea of digital hippies , but it serves an important role , @entity3 says			1
" it is the only place you can meet so many stakeholders			0
instead of reading or watching the news you are in the news , " he says			0
" i take out of it a lot of innovation , a lot of ideas , that you can use			0
but i do n't come here with a specific goal			0
i come here very curious and try to learn			0
