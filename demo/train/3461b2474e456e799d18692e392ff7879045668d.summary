-- golfing prodigies just keep getting younger			0
the latest name to wow the sport is 11 - year - old @entity4 , who made her own slice of history on monday			2
she is officially the youngest player to qualify for the @entity7 after securing her place at an event in her native @entity10			1
@entity4 , from @entity11 , shot rounds of 74 and 68 at @entity13 to beat the field by seven shots and book her place at @entity16 next month			1
she beats the previous mark held by fellow @entity19 @entity18 , who qualified for the 2007 installment aged 12			1
but @entity4 wo n't be the youngest to compete at the tournament -- that honor is still held by @entity23 , who competed in 1967 aged just 10 without having to qualify			1
@entity4 already has a victory at the world famous @entity26 under her belt , having won the inaugural drive , @entity29 and @entity30 at the @entity32 venue in april			2
now she 'll be heading to @entity16 as the third major event of the women 's season follows on directly after the men 's tournament at the same venue on june 17 for the first time in its history			1
@entity4 was one of those to make it from the @entity44 's first international qualifying events , which took place in @entity19 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			2
all of the 17 women to qualify will be making their first appearance at the @entity52 , with another raft of events running right through until the end of may			1
at the @entity57 course just outside @entity58 , @entity46 , 20 - year - old @entity59 from @entity60 qualified first just weeks after her first professional win			0
" i 'm very happy			0
i played very well today , so i 'm very pleased , " said @entity59 , who was one of eight players to make the cut			0
" i knew there were a lot of good players , but i still felt quite confident			0
" i 've grown up playing with a lot of the girls playing , so i just tried to play my own game and i knew that if you were under par you were probably going to qualify here			0
" it 's one of the biggest majors , so i 'm looking forward to going to the @entity75 and playing against the best players in the world			0
