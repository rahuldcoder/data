court documents filled tuesday call the potential sale " unlawful " and " fraudulent , " and ask for an injunction to block the sale			0
" @entity1 's latest lawsuit is a frivolous , last ditch act of desperation by a delusional , bitter man , " said @entity16 , an attorney for @entity1 's estranged wife , @entity17			1
" this action shows once more how obsessed he is with ruining a record - setting $ 2 billion sale of the @entity9 -- a sale that would solve the problems his racist rant started three months ago			1
" @entity1 came under fire for making racist remarks against african - americans in comments to his companion @entity31			2
the recorded conversation was published online			0
in response , the @entity6 banned @entity34 for life , fined him $ 2.5 million and ordered that the team be sold			2
@entity1 , in turn , sued the league for $ 1 billion for alleged antitrust violations in its handling of the matter			1
after @entity45 had her 80 - year - old husband declared mentally incapacitated by two physicians , she took over the @entity48 that owns the team			0
@entity1 , an attorney and real estate investor , has early @entity52 's or another brain disease , the doctors said			2
