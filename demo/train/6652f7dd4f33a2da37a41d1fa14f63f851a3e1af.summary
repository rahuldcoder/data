-- it 's been building for months			0
and now , according to some , @entity2 has launched a " full - scale invasion " of @entity5			1
@entity7 officials say @entity2 troops were directly involved in the latest fighting , alongside @entity11 rebels			1
" @entity2 is responsible for the violence in eastern @entity5			1
the violence is encouraged by @entity2			1
the separatists are trained by @entity2 ; they are armed by @entity2 ; they are funded by @entity2 , " president @entity13 told reporters thursday			1
@entity16 , meanwhile , has said it would do everything possible to protect ethnic @entity2 in eastern @entity5 , but denies direct involvement in the fighting			1
it says the @entity7 must stop interfering			1
a @entity2 senator and the deputy head of the @entity23 in @entity2 's upper house of @entity25 , @entity26 , dismissed reports of a @entity2 incursion as patently untrue			1
" we 've heard many statements from the government of @entity5 , which turned out to be a lie			0
what we can see now is just another lie , " he told the @entity2 state news agency @entity34			1
as the stakes seem higher than ever in @entity5 , what does this latest development -- a significant one , most believe -- mean ? @entity0 breaks down some basics : how did we get here ? last december , then - president of ukraine @entity42 backed out of a trade agreement long in the works with the @entity45 and chose to take a $ 15 billion loan from @entity2 for his economically hurting nation			1
that move angered many @entity5 who wanted their country to move more in line with the @entity45 , and who also saw their president as a corrupt politician who 'd done little to help the nation 's limping economy , experts say			0
protests broke out in the streets of @entity5 's capital , @entity60			0
shortly afterwards @entity42 lost power , and @entity2 president @entity62 ordered military exercises in @entity2 , just across @entity5 's border			1
before february was over , armed men had seized regional parliament and government buildings in @entity68 , a peninsula in southern @entity5 @entity2 whose population is mostly ethnic @entity2			1
in march , @entity2 troops annexed @entity68			1
at one point , a security camera at @entity5 military base captured a bizarre sight -- a @entity2 armored personnel carrier busting through a base gate			2
since then , fighting between @entity5 's military and @entity79 rebels has continued to rage in eastern @entity5			0
why does @entity2 care so much what happens in @entity5 ? there are strong cultural and historical ties between @entity5 and @entity2			2
more than 100 years ago , @entity5 was part of imperial @entity2			2
in march , @entity62 gave a speech at the @entity85 in which he said @entity2 planned to " welcome back " @entity68			2
" @entity68 has always been an inseparable part of @entity2 , " he said			2
a @entity88 piece by journalist @entity89 argues that @entity2 will " risk almost anything " to keep @entity68 while the @entity7 and @entity91 have minimal interests there and wo n't expend the risk to reverse the annexation			1
a former ambassador to @entity5 explained in june to @entity96 why the @entity7 should care about the nation , ranging from the fact that it 's been a solid international partner on nuclear issues and in the war in @entity102			2
@entity103 said that the " illegal seizure of @entity68 is the most blatant land - grab that @entity91 has seen since 1945			0
" if @entity91 and the @entity7 do n't adequately respond , " the danger is that mr. @entity62 may pursue other actions that would further threaten @entity91 security and stability , " he said			2
what has the @entity110 done , what can it do ? the @entity110 can always do something			0
but what is realistic and practical ? most experts believe that answers are diplomacy and sanctions			1
@entity120 , a professor of international affairs at @entity122 , says the @entity7 and allies can keep trying to isolate @entity2 diplomatically -- prohibit @entity2 leaders from attending major summits or temporarily halt trade talks , for example			1
" the dialogue should continue , " @entity120 said , on a conference call initiated by the @entity129			0
" we have to look at this crisis with a certain amount of sobriety , in the sense that we still need @entity2 cooperation , if we can get it , on a lot of issues			2
" keeping communication open with @entity2 is important to help deal with situations that are n't directly related to @entity5 -- nuclear talks with @entity143 , the continuing crisis in @entity145 , energy supplies and prices in the region and the @entity150 war			2
what 's going on with sanctions the @entity7 previously imposed on @entity2 ? back in march , interim @entity5 prime minister @entity153 said that he was afraid diplomatic pressure is n't enough			1
so far the @entity7 and allies have relied largely on sanctions to punish and influence @entity2			1
sanctions have been imposed on major @entity2 banks making it hard for those institutions to provide new medium and long - term financing in the @entity7 , senior administration officials have said			1
@entity13 imposes new sanctions on @entity2 over @entity5 there have also been sanctions that sought to freeze any @entity7 assets in @entity2 and prohibit @entity7 business contacts for eight @entity2 arms companies that make weapons			1
some of those arms are the type being used by the @entity173 separatists in @entity5			0
specific @entity2 government officials have also been the targets of sanctions			1
@entity2 sanctions : @entity110 's top 15 targets but global economist @entity179 , of the @entity129 , told @entity0 thursday that sanctions can cut both ways			1
when sanctions were stepped up after @entity183 was downed in @entity5 -- a tragedy the @entity110 blamed on @entity2 - backed separatists ( a charge @entity2 has denied ) , @entity62 attempted to retaliate by banning food and agricultural imports from countries such as the @entity7 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192			1
the ban was enacted to help ensure " the security of the @entity2			2
" @entity2 is @entity91 's largest importer in value of animals , meat , dairy products , fruits and vegetables , according to the @entity45			2
that forced the @entity45 to pay for temporary storage of butter , skim milk powder and some cheese to help farmers who would be take an economic hit			0
@entity179 said sanctions can work but the ones currently imposed are engineered to produce long - term results			0
sanctions are n't moving , he said , at the pace that matches @entity62 's actions			0
what about military options ? president @entity13 has reiterated that @entity2 's military moves in @entity68 violated international law			2
it 's a line the administration has often said -- that no nation can send troops into another country without provocation			0
while the rhetoric has been hard , it definitely does not mean military might in the force of @entity7 's own troops will ever be on the table			2
using military force to undo @entity2 's military control in @entity68 is " out of the question , " @entity120 said			0
" i do n't think anybody believes that it is of significant enough interest " to bring in @entity238 or @entity7 forces			0
even @entity5 's leadership has said military might is a mistake			0
in march , interim prime minister @entity153 told @entity0 that military force " is the way to nowhere			0
" @entity246 col. @entity245 , who served as gen. @entity248 ' executive officer in @entity102 from february 2007 to may 2008 , told @entity0 on thursday the @entity7 can " send a message to @entity2 that their conduct is unacceptable without sparking a war " with @entity2			1
what could happen next ? col. @entity245 said he was surprised by recent incursions in @entity5			0
" for a while this summer it seemed that @entity2 was backing off , " he said			0
it 's possible that @entity62 recognized gains @entity5 government security forces made in august against the @entity11 militias			0
a @entity7 official told @entity0 on thursday that intelligence suggests that up to 1,000 @entity2 troops have moved into southern @entity5 with heavy weapons and are fighting			1
satellite imagery , both commercial and from @entity238 , purportedly support that			0
@entity179 said he thinks what 's happening now could go on for some time -- a stalemate			0
the @entity7 could ramp up equipping @entity5 armed forces to fight the @entity11 separatists and the @entity7 could also station troops in @entity275 states and in @entity276 which borders @entity5			0
the @entity276 would be receptive to that , he said , and doing that would " reassure our allies that we could defend them			0
" there could be more sanctions , too			0
but any moves made must be strong , experts agreed			0
@entity62 must be made to understand " his actions are not increasing @entity2 power , " @entity245 said , " but actually bringing @entity7 power closer to @entity2			1
" because , right now , what 's happening in @entity5 thursday " shows that @entity62 's desires in that region have not yet been satisfied , " @entity245 said , " and he 's willing to risk further sanctions and further war			0

the @entity7 and allies blame @entity2 for the violence
@entity16 denies direct involvement in the fighting
diplomacy and sanctions must play a role , experts say
