-- facing anger from families of flight 370 passengers , @entity2 's prime minister said thursday his government will release its preliminary report on the plane 's disappearance			1
in a tv exclusive , @entity10 told @entity0 the report will be available to the public next week			2
" i have directed an internal investigation team of experts to look at the report , and there is a likelihood that next week we could release the report , " @entity10 said			1
later in the interview with @entity0 aviation correspondent @entity21 , he gave a more definitive statement , saying the report will be released next week			1
he also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week , his office said			1
in the @entity0 interview , @entity10 discussed why he is not yet officially declaring the flight -- and the 239 people on board -- lost			0
the report has already been sent to the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , the @entity35 body for global aviation , but not made available to the public			1
the @entity33 told @entity0 about a safety recommendation in the report : @entity2 said the aviation world needs to look at real - time tracking of commercial aircraft			1
it 's the same recommendation that was made after the @entity45 disaster in 2009			2
the prime minister 's comments did n't convince @entity48 , whose partner , @entity49 , was a passenger on the plane			1
she accused @entity10 of " political maneuvering , " shirking responsibility and deflecting blame in his interview with @entity0			1
" i spent most of the morning with my jaw basically scraping the floor , " @entity48 told @entity0 's " @entity57			2
" " i 'm just so astounded by this new shift that the prime minister is taking			1
... he 's reading from a script sheet that some qualified , professional pr person has put together for him			2
" @entity2 authorities need to do a better job of communicating with the families and answering their questions during briefings , she said , rather than treating passengers ' loved ones " as if we are the enemy , as opposed to an interested party in helping to solve this mystery			1
" " actions speak louder than words , " she said			0
" the briefings are a joke			0
... the patience level of the families group is just gone			0
" @entity2 has insisted it has nothing to hide and is working to find answers			1
a committee representing some of the @entity85 families have posted 26 questions on the @entity85 social media site @entity87			0
families plan to demand answers from @entity90 the missing flight is a @entity90 777			0
while pushing @entity2 authorities for answers , " we 're also extending our reach now , " @entity48 said			1
some of the questions the families have , including technical questions , " we will be bringing directly to @entity90			0
@entity90 has a shareholders meeting next week			0
and if we 're not getting information directly from @entity100 and from the @entity2 government , we might as well try to go directly to the source			1
" @entity90 is a publicly traded company in the @entity104 , and that puts them in a position of a little bit more fiduciary responsibility , " she said			2
asked for a response , @entity90 sent @entity0 a written statement : " our thoughts and deepest sympathies continue to be with the families and loved ones of those aboard @entity116			2
@entity90 continues to serve as a technical adviser to the @entity104 national transportation ( safety ) board , and in that role we have been an active and engaged party to the investigation			0
" ongoing search as an underwater drone keeps going up and back down , so do hopes that evidence of the plane may be found			0
a metal object that washed ashore in @entity127 and sparked the curiosity of investigators wednesday turned out to be unrelated			0
and while the @entity131 plunged into the @entity132 for its 13th mission friday , no one was certain the drone would find anything new			2
the underwater probe has already scanned 95 % of the designated search area , with no significant results			1
friday marks day 49 of the search for the plane , which disappeared on march 8 on a flight from @entity141 , @entity2 , to @entity142			1
what 's next ? @entity2 and @entity145 authorities are mapping out a long - term strategy for the search , which could go on for months or years			1
an expanded search area might include the last 370 miles ( 595 kilometers ) of the plane 's flight path , ocean search specialist @entity147 said			1
" if the idea is to go more strategic and investigate the entire aircraft flight path , maybe 15 miles or so either side , then you need a more strategic tool , and something like a deep - towed sonar that can provide a very large range indeed -- at the expense of resolution			0
" the use of a deep - towed submersible device called the @entity164 is overdue , said @entity165 , managing director of @entity166			0
" that should be brought in as quickly as possible , again , from the @entity104			0
" he said it may be time to go back and revisit the calculations of where the plane may be , although officials have already been doing that			0
" this is not an exact science , " @entity165 said			0
" we have to understand that			0
" why so private ? @entity2 has not been known as a model of transparency			2
the same political party has ruled the country for the past 50 years , and the media is not completely free			0
for its part , the @entity186 has agreed to have an international team investigate the disappearance of flight 370 , the country 's acting transportation minister said			1
@entity191 said the names of the members will be announced next week			0
he also said the team will not be looking into the criminal aspects of the investigation , which remain under the @entity197			2
" the main purpose is to evaluate and determine the cause of the accident , " @entity191 said			0
the question no one wants to ask : what if flight 370 is never found ? inside a black box investigation lab sad , angry relatives in agonizing limbo @entity0 's @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			1

new : the @entity131 has combed 95 % of a search area with no significant results
@entity218 's partner accuses @entity2 prime minister of deflecting blame
the *pm* asked an investigation team to see what other information can be released
