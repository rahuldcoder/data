-- by the year 2050 , @entity1 will no longer be the most populous country in the world			1
@entity4 will see its population grow by 700 million people by 2050 , the @entity3 estimates			1
that distinction will pass to @entity4 , where more than 1.8 billion people could be competing for their country 's resources , according to the @entity3 's @entity11			1
the 2007 population estimates from the @entity3 and the @entity13 set @entity1 's current population at around 1.3 billion people , and @entity4 's at around 1.1 billion			1
if population continues to grow at the estimated rate , such rapid growth in @entity4 between now and mid-century could lead to overpopulation and an uncertain future for the environment and the people living there			1
and while organizations like the @entity26 and the @entity27 are working to promote the human rights and environmental consequences of overpopulation , not everyone views the newest population estimates with pessimism			1
" nothing ever continues at its present rate , neither the stock market nor population growth , " said @entity33 , the dean of the school of @entity36 at the @entity37 , and an expert in the history of cities and urban design , which he 's taught for more than 31 years			1
" there is a substantial body of evidence that the world population will flatten out in about 30 years , " he said			1
" built into that model would be an assumption that more of the world 's population will become urban , and as such the population will begin to decline			1
" citing historical evidence of falling birthrates in urban populations , @entity33 looks to @entity60 as a current example of the phenomenon			0
" @entity60 right now [ is ] not at a point where it can sustain its current level			0
and i do n't think that 's because people in @entity60 have suddenly become aware of the need to conserve resources			0
i think it has more to do with decisions that are made by families on the margin not to have as many children			0
" consequences of overpopulation overpopulation occurs when a population 's density exceeds the capacity of the environment to supply the health requirements of an individual , according to the @entity84			1
environmentalists have long been concerned about the resources threatened by rapidly growing human populations , focusing on phenomenon such as deforestation , desertification , air pollution and global warming			0
but the worst - case scenario for people experiencing overpopulation , according to @entity95 , president of the @entity26 , is a lack of fresh , clean water			1
" if the water goes , the species goes , " he said			1
" that sounds kind of alarmist , " @entity95 conceded , " considering there 's water all around us , but 97 percent plus is saltwater , and the freshwater that we use to sustain ourselves is just native to 3 percent			1
... so the accessibility of water , the competition for water , the availability of water is going to be a major , major threat , " he said , noting world population growth estimates at more than 9 billion people by 2050			1
nine billion is an exceptional amount of people , considering the world 's population only reached 1 billion in 1830 , according to the @entity26 , a nonprofit organization that works to fund population and family planning programs around the world			2
by 1999 , world population reached 6 billion , and in the relatively short time between 2007 and 2050 , there could be roughly 2.4 billion more people on @entity125 needing clean water , space and other natural resources from their environment in order to survive			1
governments facing overpopulation will also struggle to manage waste , said @entity33			2
" handling your waste and the public health consequences of not handling it well is the biggest problem that will be faced in rapidly growing urban areas in the developing world			2
" when @entity144 , @entity145 , faced a population boom in the 1850s , for example , its infrastructure was not prepared for the excess waste , which resulted in cholera outbreaks			2
" huge outbreaks , " said @entity33			0
" fifty - thousand people dying over the summer			0
that 's the kind of thing that in the developed world we no longer have problems with , but in the developing world are very , very real			2
" @entity95 said that 97 percent of world population growth between now and 2050 will occur in the developing world , where governments face serious economic and social challenges			1
" i would say most of this is in @entity161 , where by every other health indicator , they rank at the bottom , " @entity95 said			0
" this growth rate is taking place despite the high levels of @entity168 and @entity169 and [ tuberculosis ] and malaria			0
" health care -- and the lack of it -- is also a factor in the rising populations in developing countries , according to @entity177 , @entity27 senior policy adviser			2
" we 've seen a global trend of people wanting smaller families , but in the poorer settings that 's not quite the case yet , " @entity177 said			0
" and it 's certainly not the case within countries that the poor [ do not ] have access to the kinds of services that the wealthy avail themselves of			0
" globally , @entity177 said the poorest fifth of people in countries with rapid population growth have twice as many children , on average , as the wealthy people in those same countries			2
birthrates make a difference the massive growth in developing nations is due in large part to fertility rates , where women during their reproductive years will have an average of five children , said @entity95			1
" that 's considerably higher than it is in the developed world			0
" in addition to the growing demands of developing nations , emerging countries like @entity1 and @entity4 are rapidly industrializing , said @entity95			1
" their demands for food alone will have considerable impact on global markets			0
" @entity1 's government has instituted population control methods in order to curb growth			2
their controversial " one child " policies have garnered an uneasy reception , especially in rural populations , where people complain of stiff fines or forced sterilizations and abortions as a result of breaking population laws			2
traditionally , rural populations are larger than urban populations , said @entity95			0
this is because rural families need to be larger in order to work and live off the land , and urban populations -- with better education , health care and family planning opportunities -- offer parents the luxury of choosing how many children they will have , he said			0
this year is the first year that rural and urban populations are nearly equal , according to the @entity27 's annual report			0
this creates a mixed bag of concerns , according to @entity95 , that include susceptibility of young urban populations in poor countries with weak governments to recruitment for terrorism and conditions of instability			0
" we have never in the history of the world experienced urban growth rates or metropolitan growth rates at the same level that we are experiencing now , " said @entity33			0
