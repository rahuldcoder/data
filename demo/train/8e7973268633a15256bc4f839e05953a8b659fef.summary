@entity0 -- there 's no shortage of diners in @entity0 , but one of its most beloved will soon be taking up residence in @entity7			1
the @entity8 , which opened in 1940 in @entity0 , shut its doors in april 2008			1
the @entity8 , which first opened in 1940 , was split in two monday night to begin its move on a pair of flatbed trucks some 860 miles to its new home near @entity14			1
the dining experience at the @entity16 was typical of many similar @entity0 eateries , where more often than not , you 're guaranteed a hearty meal at a comfortable price			1
after taking a seat in a roomy booth or even at the counter , you check out the flimsy paper placemat with innocuous historical information or a simplified map of the @entity29 isles			2
a busboy places a glass of ice water on your table			2
then it 's time to break out the reading glasses and flex those muscles to heft the always lengthy menu			2
while it may take you several minutes to sift through it , take comfort in knowing that you may actually burn some calories by lifting this bible of comfort food			0
unlike the sometimes stuffy pretense of a formal restaurant , the diner experience is generally simple , while the food offerings are diverse -- from apple pie to baked ziti and everything in between			1
while never known as a bastion for fine dining , the @entity16 saw brighter days before it unceremoniously closed on a chilly sunday in april 2008			1
originally known as the @entity54 until its moniker was changed in 1986 , the pre-assembled restaurant stood as a rare classic definition of free - standing diners			1
its streamlined , railcar - inspired design boasts a reverse - channel illuminated neon sign			2
horizontal and vertical stainless steel strips border the colorful enamel panels and wrap - around windows on its facade			2
celebrities from @entity68 to @entity69 entered through its curved entryway lined with glass blocks			1
but , like a beloved baseball team whose owner has tossed in the towel , the @entity16 is moving to a new town for a new life in a new home			1
the owner of the diner , @entity80 , wanted to change the flavor of the block and replace the eatery with a multilevel condo building			2
enter preservationist @entity86 , a 26 - year - old patron saint of sorts for unwanted diners			2
@entity86 found out that the @entity16 was facing demolition and began to look for a guardian angel to save it			1
he connected with @entity7 businessman @entity91 , head of the investment group @entity92 , who saw the @entity16 for sale on a web site devoted to the preservation of @entity0 structures and fell in love with its " gorgeous structure			1
" " i like it better each time i see it , " @entity99 said			0
the exterior facades are second to none			0
i think it 's the most beautiful diner in the world			2
" @entity99 and his business associate , @entity108 , have a grand vision for the diner and eventually want to incorporate it as part of an entertainment and historic area outside of @entity14			1
once it 's restored , which could take up to a year , the @entity16 will become the first free - standing diner in @entity7 , @entity99 said			1
a longtime collector of antique cars and @entity121 memorabilia , @entity99 is a firm believer in the lessons that can be learned from the past			0
" if you think about what 's wrong with today , in order to fix the problems of today , you 've got to look back ... [ to ] when it was better , " @entity99 said			0
" i think [ the diner ] is symbolic of the glory days			2
technology and more money does n't necessarily mean progress			0
we long for simpler times , " he explained			0
" these types of buildings can be an instrument for our youth to learn from the past			0
teenagers need a clean environment for entertainment , a ' hang out			0
' " the departure of the @entity8 brings back some bitter memories for aficionados of historic @entity0			1
the @entity149 encountered a similar fate in 2007 , after it was put up for sale by developers who purchased the land it was sitting on and planned to build a hotel			0
that summer , a couple from @entity157 found the @entity149 's sale notice on the @entity160 web site			0
@entity86 acted as a conduit there also , helping to broker the sale of the 1920s diner located in the @entity166 section of @entity167 , which the couple planned to move to their home state			1
when news of the sale and move came out , the @entity171 began to have some doubts			0
" we 're quiet people , " said @entity176 , of @entity177 , @entity157			0
" [ but ] the media response has been a blessing as people have shown a keen interest			0
" @entity181 and her husband paid $ 7,500 for the @entity149 and ultimately invested $ 40,000 to move it more than 2,100 miles to @entity177 , where it became a popular site in the town of 600 residents with few other restaurants			0
the barrel - roofed diner reopened on january 12 this year , complete with its original floor and window frames			1
customers can sit at the old - fashioned soda fountain or on the outdoor patio in the summer			2
the menu contains the traditional diner fare -- burgers , fries and milk shakes -- but also caters to the local palate , with chicken fried steaks , ribeye steaks and prime rib			2
" business has been exceptional			0
we 've been able to hold our own , " said @entity181			0
" we get a lot of people who take a detour to visit us			0
" she noted that it 's a lot of work , and a huge commitment , but said she and her husband " have been blessed			0
" " there 's never going to be another @entity149 , " she said			0
in response to critics who complain that historic pieces of @entity0 are being sold off , @entity181 said that in the cases of old diners , " to keep it alive , somewhere else is the best option , [ rather ] than seeing it demolished			1
we 've run into @entity0 who are appreciative that we brought it back to life			1
" @entity99 is hoping that will be the case with the @entity16 , which was loved as a no - frills refuge for comfort food on @entity167 's desolate west side			1
but now it 's served up its last order in @entity0			1
and that last order was to go .			0
