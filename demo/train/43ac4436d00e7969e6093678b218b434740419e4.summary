an @entity2 journalist kneels in the desert , dressed in an orange prison - style jumpsuit			1
a masked " executioner " lords over him , wielding a knife			2
the journalist speaks ; the executioner speaks			2
and then the horrific happens : the victim is beheaded			0
" it is almost the exact same choreography , " said @entity12 , a professor at @entity13 , comparing @entity15 videos showing the deaths of @entity2 journalists @entity17 and @entity19			1
the executioner appears to be the same person			2
the location of the two killings also appears to be similar			2
@entity12 suspects they took place in or around the @entity29 city of @entity30 , one of the safest areas for @entity15 , which calls itself the @entity33			1
" it 's titled ' a second message to @entity2 , ' and it basically contains exactly the same message , " @entity12 said about the @entity17 video , which was posted tuesday			1
a video of @entity19 's execution was released last month			2
the executioner @entity17 's apparent executioner speaks in what sounds like the same @entity44 accent as the man who purportedly killed @entity19			2
he 's dressed identically in both videos , head to toe in black , with a face mask and combat boots			1
he appears to be of similar build and height			2
he waves a knife in his left hand , as did the militant in the video of @entity19 's death			0
and then , there are his actual words			0
" i 'm back , @entity63 , and i 'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the @entity33 , " the executioner says in the second video			1
" just as your missiles continue to strike our people , our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people			0
" @entity63 on @entity15 in @entity29 : ' we do n't have a strategy yet ' at the end , the video threatens the life of a @entity44 captive , just as the @entity19 video threatened @entity17 's life			1
the @entity78 says there 's no question the same masked fighter appears in both videos			0
adds @entity84 's @entity83 , " he certainly wants us to think that he is the very same man			0
" following @entity19 's death , the @entity44 ambassador to the @entity2 said that experts in his country were close to identifying his killer			1
he has not yet been named			0
questions the @entity2 intelligence community is busy analyzing the @entity17 video to try to answer some key questions : when it was shot ? where was it shot ? is the killer the same as the one in the @entity19 video ? the administration does not want to speculate on specifics of the video until those questions can answered , a senior official told reporters			1
@entity107 , a forensic audio and video expert , said analysts will comb through every inch of the video , " analyzing the electronic impulses , the audio , the video , the speech , voice identification , the geography -- for whatever information it can provide -- as well as the production techniques			1
" @entity2 analysts have said it 's not possible to know from the first video who beheaded @entity19 because the entire slaying is not shown			1
a man moves a knife across @entity19 's neck , then the picture fades to black			0
@entity131 : ' the cancer of @entity15 will not be allowed to spread ' one forensics expert has raised the issue that there appear to be two militants in the video			1
the second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit			0
" there 's definitely a change of actor , " said @entity140 , the forensics expert			0
" there are noticeable -- there are subtle -- but there are also noticeable changes in their build , their physical appearance			0
" the man who speaks , holds a knife in one of his hands			0
it looks to be a different knife than the one that was left next to @entity19 's body			0
also , the dimensions and style of the knives are slightly different , @entity140 said			0
in the @entity17 video , the picture fades to black immediately before and after the start of the beheading so , again , it 's not immediately clear whether the man speaking is the same man who then killed the journalist			1

the @entity2 intelligence community is analyzing the latest video
@entity15 videos of journalists ' beheadings are strikingly similar
they appear to be shot in the same place , with the same executioner
the videos fade to black at certain points in production
