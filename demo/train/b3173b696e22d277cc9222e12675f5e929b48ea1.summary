-- think of eight people you know			1
one of them may go to bed hungry tonight			1
not surprisingly , about 98 % of hungry people live in developing countries and the crisis will likely get worse			1
over the next 12 years , the @entity8 projects the global population will hit 8 billion people			1
if we want to solve the problem , we first have to target the people who produce the food			1
for nearly 70 years , @entity15 has been working with small farming communities to raise productivity and create a surplus that can be sold or provided to other hungry people			1
next , we focus on the women			2
there are 600 million small farmers and herders in the world , but one of the key reasons there are so many hungry people is because nearly half of those farmers are women			1
even though they are as equally capable as male farmers , these women face challenges that cause them to grow less food			1
according to a recent report by the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , women farmers typically have less land to farm and probably do n't own that land			1
they own fewer farm animals and have less access to improved seeds			0
in addition , they have lower education levels than men and are less likely to get credit or insurance			0
in fact , if women farmers were on the same playing field as their male counterparts , the @entity37 says the number of hungry people in the world would be reduced by up to 17 %			1
so how do we level that playing field ? we connect the unconnected			0
this is simply organizing farmers -- connecting them to each other , to supply chains and then to markets			2
but it goes deeper than traditional community development			0
communities have to become engaged in a journey of personal transformation as individuals , families and villages			0
for success to be solid , there must be harmony that connects and heals the psychological and social effects of generations of poverty and hunger			2
it takes months of training for this transformation to take root			0
only then does the physical transfer of livestock and other agricultural inputs like goats , heifers , seeds or trees take place			0
then we prepare the families and work together to build pro-poor , wealth - creating systems to get their products into markets			0
the transformation we witness in community after community is a path from hopelessness to a sense of personal leadership , ownership and purpose			0
self - confidence is built and equality develops between men and women			2
it is so powerful to watch people being incredibly proud that they have made the step from feeling oppressed , diminished and insignificant to becoming part of the solution			2
one of our largest programs is @entity116 in @entity117			0
it 's a five - year commitment to rebuild rural communities and improve economic opportunities			2
by the end of the project , we will have helped more than 20,000 vulnerable rural families with jobs , skills training and disaster preparedness			0
working faster and bigger has to be our ultimate goal so that the small farmers of today can be fed and can prepare for the rapidly growing population			1
success will depend on deeply embedded social engagement on the part of those farmers			0
and , on our part , to connect with them in ways that are supportive , patient and ultimately highly productive			0
ending world hunger can be done .			1

about 98 % of hungry people live in developing countries
@entity15 's *mission* to end world hunger begins with small farmers
women make up nearly half of farmers , yet challenges cause them to grow less food
@entity15 believes *empowering* women is key to ending the global hunger crisis
