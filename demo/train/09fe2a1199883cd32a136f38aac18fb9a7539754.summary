@entity0 is on the hunt in @entity3			0
her tour of the region will see her travel to @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			0
not in search of lions , rhinos or other big game			0
rather she 's on a quest for a much more elusive creature -- the @entity18 poet			1
" we have a rich oral tradition and it 's important that we document what is happening in history poetry-wise , " she explains			1
" @entity3 has a history of a lack of documentation and we really did n't want this to happen to our poets			2
" @entity0 , 29 , is part of the team behind the @entity31 , the largest online archive of @entity18 poetry , accessible via mobile phone , in the world			1
the @entity37 project was originally conceived as an annual poetry festival overseen by the @entity39 , a pan-african organization based in @entity41 in 2008			0
over the following years it grew to become a powerful mouthpiece for showcasing @entity18 wordsmiths			1
and by 2012 , the institution decided to move online in an effort to break down geographical borders and open up their diverse anthology to a wider audience in @entity3			0
poetry in your phone following an overhaul of the site last year , @entity53 relaunched in september , making its immersive archive accessible to a broader international following through a " mobile - first " site			1
it 's a shrewd move on a continent where mobile phones have revolutionized critical sectors such as education , healthcare and agriculture			1
adoption of mobile phone use has been prolific in @entity3 with mobile data services going from strength to strength			2
seven out of 10 mobile users in @entity73 use their phones to browse the web , according to a recent report from @entity77			1
elsewhere , a study by analyst firm @entity79 predicted in november that " mobile broadband connections in @entity3 are set to rise from 96 million in 2013 to 950 million to cover 77.3 % of all mobile subscriptions in the continent by the end of 2019			1
" @entity89 adds : " a lot of @entity91 use their mobiles to go on the @entity93 and because they are own main target audience , we had to cater for them and make it easy for them to access this content			0
" to date , the project has collected almost 400 @entity18 poets from 31 countries in @entity3 and across the diaspora , in 14 different languages			1
since the relaunch , users are able to navigate the site through a myriad of options including by theme , poet , country , language , emotion or by their " @entity113 " list , a popular feature curated by a guest poet each month			1
and it seems their following has embraced the organization 's decision to go forward on mobile with an average of 3,000 visitors to the site monthly			1
" we want the archive to be a place where people can come and get educated about what other @entity18 poets are saying			1
a place for them to interact with one another , " says @entity0			0
" there is great value in a @entity8 interacting with a @entity132			0
a @entity132 interacting with a @entity18 ... " also the archive has now reached an international status and it has become a global stage			1
poets can get the exposure that they usually do not get			2
" @entity41 - based poet @entity139 , who compiled this month 's " @entity113 " list , says : " i do n't think the importance of an archive like this can be overstated			1
it is the first ' living archive ' focusing solely on poets from @entity3 and the diaspora			1
" the archive serves a number of purposes : it makes poets available to an international audience -- and for less known poets , this is a chance to be heard beyond their own community , city or country			1
it raises the the profile of poetry from and of the continent , while allowing people to engage with the words through hearing and reading them			1
" hot on the trail of poets two poets are introduced to the platform weekly and each poet profile features a short biography , two text poems , a photograph and audio podcast recordings of the wordsmith reading their works			1
@entity0 , a poet and writer herself , says : " it adds so much value to actually hear the poet 's voice recite their work			1
it adds a different dimension , it adds a texture			0
we really want to give our audience a holistic experience of poetry			0
" if some people just choose to read it , that 's fine			2
but if others want to hear it , ( the podcast ) really brings the work to life			0
" meanwhile , @entity139 , who also runs poetry and performance workshops , says the multi-layered format " democratizes poetry " by " offering an equal platform to poets working in all languages on the continent , and to established and emerging poets			1
" poets can supply their work directly to the organization via the project 's submissions page			1
it is then evaluated by a rolling judging panel who determine whether the work is suitable for @entity53			0
" at any given time we have two or three poets sitting on the panel , " says @entity0			2
" we try to have a mix of people so we will invite poets to come curate for us			2
it keeps the selection process exciting and diverse			0
" conversely , the team also approach poets directly to inquire if they are interested in adding their work to the collection			2
additionally , they travel to various nations in search of poets to connect with			2
" we write to publishers or anybody who has access to these poets and build those profiles			2
we do , from time to time , have to travel to a specific country			0
we really have to do a lot of ploughing and digging of the poetry scene and that space			0
" one such voice on the platform is @entity246 - born @entity245 poet @entity244			2
having first encountered @entity53 while visiting @entity41 several years ago , he is thrilled to see how the organization has created a burgeoning poetry scene online			0
" i had the chance to visit their studios and to learn more about what they intended to do			0
it was exciting to see this fledgling idea blossom into what is simply one of the best things to happen to @entity18 poetry in a long time			1
" the concept is simple , but the impact is massive			0
" existing in an online space @entity244 , who is also a distinguished actor , documentary writer and founder of the prestigious @entity264 , has not only curated content for the site but he 's also featured in this month 's " @entity113 , " compiled by @entity18 's @entity139			1
he adds : " of course it feels good to see that other poets are engaged by my work			2
i am not sure what it means really ( to be included in the @entity113 ) , but i have to think that the few poems on the site resonate with people in positive ways			1
i am in good company , frankly , and i find that an honor			0
" it 's a sentiment project manager @entity0 says many poets share about their inclusion in @entity37			1
" when we first started there was obviously a bit of resistance			0
people not understanding how being online works			0
now as a society , we are more accustomed to being online , a lot of our activities are based online -- we shop online -- so as society becomes more comfortable with the idea of the web , so do poets , " explains the curator			2
" poets are very open to it and they appreciate having such a space there they can engage with one another			2
" @entity53 is principally funded by @entity300 , a @entity18 wine estate , with additional financing from applications to the government and other private institutions			1
and in a time when traditional publishers are shying away from printing poetry due to lack of sales , the project offers poets a new outlet for presenting their work in a digital age			0
but @entity89 is quick to clarify @entity53 's position as an alternative literary publisher			0
" a lot of publishers right now are n't publishing a lot of poetry , ( and ) we do n't want that to be what stops us as poets from having thriving careers			0
i think we can exist online and maybe when people see how popular poetry really is , they can start increasing the number of books being published			0
i think we can coexist and work with one another			0
