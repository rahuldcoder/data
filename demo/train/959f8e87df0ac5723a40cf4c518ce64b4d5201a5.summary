-- @entity2 's fraught relationship with @entity3 is set to erode further after the @entity3 @entity4 passed controversial legislation criminalizing any public denial of what the bill calls the @entity10 genocide in @entity2 in 1915 -- a description @entity2 has rejected			1
under the legislation , anyone denying the deaths were genocide could face a jail term and a fine of â ‚ ¬ 45,000 ( $ 58,000 )			0
the lower house of @entity3 parliament passed the so - called armenian genocide bill last december , prompting @entity2 to recall its ambassador from @entity21 and to cancel certain bilateral visits between the countries			1
the @entity3 @entity4 then voted late monday to approve the bill			1
what do @entity25 say allegedly happened in 1915 ? @entity10 groups and many scholars argue that starting in 1915 , @entity29 committed genocide , when more than a million ethnic @entity25 were massacred in the waning days of the @entity2			1
the @entity29 - @entity10 controversy over the killings that took place last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist			1
what does @entity2 say happened in 1915 ? modern - day @entity2 , which emerged after the collapse of the @entity2 , has always denied a genocide took place in 1915			1
it argues instead that hundreds of thousands of @entity10 @entity40 and @entity41 @entity29 died from intercommunal violence , disease and general chaos -- not from a specific plan to eliminate @entity25 -- around the bloody battlefields of @entity47 " it has always been a sensitive issue , " said dr. @entity48 , a lecturer in @entity49 at the @entity50			1
" @entity2 has always refused to accept that it was a planned event			0
they argue that genocide only applies if it was a plan to exterminate people			0
" why is @entity3 doing this now ? @entity3 formally recognized the killings as genocide in 2001			2
as there is no new information or new recognition about what the facts are about events of 1915 , some experts believe @entity3 president @entity66 may be using the genocide bill for political gain ahead of the country 's presidential election in april			1
" it 's clear that president @entity66 has put this on the table for electoral reasons - there is an @entity10 community in @entity3 which will of course be voting , " @entity71 , senior foreign analyst at @entity72 , told @entity0 on monday			2
the bill has been applauded by @entity25 , roughly 500,000 of whom live in @entity3			1
the bill 's author , @entity82 from @entity66 's ruling party , has denied any political motivation			0
as for @entity66 , he has said his country does n't need an ok from another nation to develop its policies			0
in a letter to the @entity29 government , he said the law is not aimed at any country , but only at addressing past suffering			0
what is the public opinion in @entity2 regarding the @entity10 massacre ? using the word genocide when talking about @entity10 may not be as taboo as it once was , but @entity29 still chafe at the idea of other countries writing their history , says @entity102 , @entity2 analyst at @entity103 , a @entity104 - based think tank			1
" things have been progressing , but the population does not like foreign powers defining their history , " he said			0
" it generates a lot of misgivings			0
" how would passage of the genocide bill affect @entity2 - @entity3 relations ? ties between the two countries could now unravel further			1
@entity2 already recalled its ambassador from @entity21 and cancelled some bilateral visits between the two countries after the @entity3 lower house passed the bill in december , and @entity29 prime minister @entity120 warned " this is only the first phase			1
" @entity120 has also accused @entity3 of committing its own genocide during the war in @entity124 in the 1950s and 1960s			2
" in @entity124 , an estimated 15 percent of the population had been subjected to the massacre of @entity3 from 1945 on			0
this is genocide , " @entity120 said at a conference in @entity128 last year			0
" @entity124 were burnt en masse in ovens			0
if @entity3 president mr. ( @entity66 ) @entity66 does not know about this genocide , he should ask his father @entity135			2
his father @entity135 served as a soldier in the @entity3 legion in @entity124 in 1940s			0
" once under @entity3 colonial rule , guerrillas in the @entity140 nation fought a bloody war against the @entity3 presence there from 1954 to 1962			2
the @entity144 shot back at @entity120 's comments , saying " we deplore excessive use of formulas and personal attacks that do not meet up to the standards of our mutual interest and of our relations			0
@entity3 recalls that it assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history			0
" @entity120 has said that passage of the bill would result in @entity2 initiating additional measures against @entity3			1
" this will create a lot of noise and difficulty in @entity2 's overall relationships with @entity3 and other @entity170 states that will complicate " @entity2 's efforts to gain accession to the @entity170 , said @entity162 , a former @entity163 ambassador to @entity2			2
@entity2 and @entity3 are @entity177 allies , and , according to official @entity29 statistics , the volume of trade between @entity2 and @entity3 from january to the end of october this year was more than $ 13.5 billion			1
do any countries recognize the killing of @entity25 in @entity2 in 1915 as genocide ? twenty countries do , including @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 , according to @entity102			1
the genocide debate is an annual source of tension between @entity2 and the @entity163 , also two @entity177 allies			0
the @entity191 , for example , annually beats back efforts in @entity193 to pass a resolution which would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of @entity25 as genocide			2
