-- support from the @entity4 , @entity5 and other @entity2 allies is crucial to the success of reconciliation talks with the @entity9 , @entity2 president @entity1 said in an interview with @entity0 's @entity11 that aired sunday			1
" the @entity12 is authorized by the @entity2 people to talk with the @entity9 , " @entity1 said			1
" these are initial contacts being made , but these contacts would not yield results , would not give us the results that we seek , unless and until the @entity4 and @entity5 , especially , with our other allies , back it with practical application of the means that they have in their disposal			1
" last week , outgoing @entity4 defense secretary @entity29 said , " there 's been outreach ( to the @entity9 ) on the part of a number of countries , including the @entity4			1
i would say that these contacts are very preliminary			0
" " my own view is that real reconciliation talks are not likely to be able to make any substantive headway until at least this winter , " @entity29 said			0
among the conditions required by the @entity4 of the @entity9 : complete disassociation from @entity36 and " meeting the redlines that president @entity1 and the coalition have laid down			1
" @entity1 said earlier this month that " peace negotiations with the @entity9 and with other countrymen have been started			1
those who accept the constitution , freedom , democracy and development of @entity2 can take part in this negotiation			2
" " the @entity2 people need peace , " @entity1 said in the @entity0 interview			1
" the @entity2 people want peace			2
they want their children sent to school			0
mothers want to be without worry when they have their children go to school or their husbands to ( a ) job , or when the women go out to work			0
this country needs to live like all other nations live			0
" " ... we must reach this human desire through a reasonable means , through a realistic approach , " he said			0
" and that is dialogue with a condition that the gains of @entity2 over the past 10 years not be compromised , that the gains of our women not be compromised , that our children must continue to go to school , that our constitution be respected and recognized			2
and that having fulfilled that , that the @entity9 , who agree to this -- and the absolute majority of them agree to this -- will return to their homes in dignity			2
" @entity1 also said he welcomes @entity4 president @entity85 's plans for a drawdown of @entity4 troops , calling it a sign that @entity2 is ready to take control of security in the war - torn nation			1
" the number of troops that he has announced to be withdrawn is a sign that @entity2 is taking over its own security and is trying to defend it territory by its own means , " @entity1 said			1
" so we are happy about the announcement			0
" as the @entity4 pulls back , @entity1 painted a picture of a more stable @entity2 , despite the fact that may was the bloodiest month for @entity2 civilians since 2007			1
@entity1 , who spoke to @entity11 earlier this week , said @entity2 were ready to take the reins of their own country			1
" it is the responsibility of the @entity2 people to protect their country and to provide security for the citizens of the country , " @entity1 said			1
" if you fail in fulfilling our most important responsibility with regard to our country and our people , then somebody else should take over			0
" @entity85 announced wednesday night that 10,000 @entity4 troops would leave @entity2 this year and all 33,000 forces , sent as part of a 2009 surge , would return home by the summer of 2012			1
@entity1 also defended his public criticisms of @entity129 , which in recent weeks have taken on a more angry tone			1
@entity1 blasted the alliance for civilian deaths and nighttime raids			2
he said his comment on @entity129 becoming an " occupying force " was taken out of context			0
" no i do n't regret having made that comment , " he said			0
" that comment was not seen in the full sentence that i spoke			0
it was after the incident of civilian casualties in @entity2 where children were killed in an aerial bombing , where i said , ' no more of such aerial bombings on our residents			0
' " the question was what if they continue ? " @entity1 said			0
" when @entity2 asks that these operations cease and even then , if they continue , this means we are not in charge of our country , " he said			2
" and that , of course , becomes an occupation			0
it was in this context that i spoke , and i stand by that			0
" " my statements are neither hostile nor inflammatory nor designed to get anything but an understanding from our partners that the @entity2 people need to feel secure , they need to see this war take a direction in which they can see the end of the tunnel , " @entity1 said			2
he said @entity2 , dependent on @entity4 dollars for security and development , was grateful to @entity4 taxpayers but expressed dismay that @entity4 humanitarian efforts have not always taken @entity2 wishes into account			1
he cited a @entity181 electricity project in which he said the @entity4 spent $ 250 million to buy generators			0
@entity1 said @entity2 would have preferred the construction of a dam , which he called a more lasting solution .			2
