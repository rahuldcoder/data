@entity0 -- as thousands gathered sunday in @entity0 for a march and rally focused on gay rights issues , lawmakers showed that some of the demonstrators ' key goals face major obstacles ahead			1
president @entity11 speaks to a major gay - rights group saturday night in @entity0			1
even with president @entity11 pushing @entity13 to repeal the @entity14 -- a stance he highlighted to one of the nation 's leading gay - rights groups saturday night , to huge applause -- members of his own party told @entity1 they 're not in lockstep			1
" i 've said in the past i do n't think that 's the way to go , " sen. @entity23 , @entity24 , told @entity1 's @entity25			2
he added , " we can move forward on a lot of measures , but i 'm not sure there 's the support yet for that			0
" sen. @entity34 , @entity35 , noted that her state is one of many that has a law prohibiting same - sex marriage			0
" so i think , for a number of us , that becomes a challenge , " she said			0
@entity34 would not say whether she would vote to repeal the @entity14			2
the law , signed by president @entity45 in 1996 , defines marriage as being between a man and a woman , and ensures that states do not have to recognize same - sex marriages performed in other states			0
@entity45 has since changed his mind , and said he no longer opposes same - sex marriage			0
@entity11 does not support same - sex marriage and has said he believes marriage is between a man and a woman			1
he does , however , support civil unions for same - sex couples that offer similar rights and protections			2
the two @entity63 senators on sunday expressed support for the president 's stances on several other key issues regarding gay rights , including legislation expanding the definition of hate crimes to include attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity			1
the bill passed the @entity76 last week			0
both also expressed support for the president 's efforts to end the military 's " @entity81 " policy			1
on @entity85 's " @entity84 , " sen. @entity83 , @entity35 , said he thinks the president will succeed on that front			2
" i think he will and he can , but it has to be done in the right way , which is to get a buy - in from the military , which i think is now possible , " @entity83 said			1
" other militaries in the @entity94 -- the @entity97 and other @entity96 armies -- have ended this discriminatory policy			0
we can do it successfully , but it ought to be done with thoughtfulness , with care and with a buy - in from the military			1
" retired gen. @entity106 , former chairman of the @entity107 , said , " gays can serve in the military ; they just ca n't do so openly			0
and they do , and there are lots of them , and we 're the beneficiary of all that			0
" @entity106 did not weigh in on whether the change should happen , but said he agreed with @entity83 that the " senior military leadership needs to be part of this , the @entity119 needs to be part of this			0
" but retired @entity123 gen. @entity122 disagreed			0
" there 's no question that it 's time to change the policy			2
the key to it is n't buy - in from the military ; it 's for @entity13 to change the law			1
they ought to do so , and i 'm confident that the military will move ahead on it , " he said			0
sen. @entity136 , @entity138 - @entity137 , rejected @entity122 's suggestion			2
" it 's my belief that if you do n't have buy - in from the military , that 's a disservice to the people in the military			1
they should be included in this			0
i 'm open - minded to what the military may suggest , but i can tell you i 'm not going to make policy based on a campaign rally , " @entity136 told @entity85			1
" if this policy about ' @entity81 ' changes , it should be done based not on politics , but on reason			1
" in his speech saturday night to the @entity158 -- the nation 's largest gay rights group -- @entity11 praised the gay community for making strides in equal rights and pledged to deliver on major campaign promises that critics say he 's left on the back burner			1
" for nearly 30 years , you 've advocated for those without a voice , " @entity11 said			2
" despite the progress we 've made , there are still laws to change and hearts to open			0

some *democrats* *cautious* about @entity11 's pledge to end @entity14
some say they think he *'ll* succeed in ending military 's " @entity81 " policy
others *debate* whether military " buy - in " is necessary to end that policy
thousands of gay and *lesbian* rights supporters hold rally in @entity0 on sunday
