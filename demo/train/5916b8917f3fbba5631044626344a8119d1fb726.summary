@entity0 -- with more than a dozen lawmakers absent due to travel delays caused by bad weather , the @entity2 postponed until tuesday a key procedural vote on a politically charged proposal to extend long - term unemployment insurance affecting some 1.3 million @entity9			1
senate majority leader @entity10 received unanimous approval for a postponement from both parties just before the chamber was scheduled to hold the test vote on the first partisan showdown of the new year on monday evening			1
backers of the bill to extend long - term unemployment benefits were nearing the 60 votes they need to clear the procedural vote			1
four republicans said monday they will join the 55 members of the @entity25 caucus to vote to begin debate on the bill			1
but that 's still one vote shy of the 60 votes needed to overcome a @entity22 filibuster			2
@entity22 aides and senators differed on whether any other @entity22 would vote for the measure			1
the vote is scheduled for tuesday at 10:30 a.m. big moments on @entity35 from here on out should be viewed through the lens of november 's midterm elections , especially in the @entity2 , where @entity22 are aiming to retake control			1
extending benefits is a political priority for congressional @entity25 and president @entity43 , who is trying to make income equality a centerpiece of his second term			1
@entity43 reached out to several @entity22 senators to try to persuade them to support the bill			1
many @entity22 argue a $ 6.4 billion extension would hurt the economy and act as a disincentive to job creation			0
others members of the @entity22 have signaled they might back an extension if the cost is offset elsewhere in the budget			1
sen. @entity57 of @entity58 , a @entity22 who often works across the aisle , got a call from @entity43 but missed it because he was n't in the office			1
@entity57 said he wants to help people but insisted @entity64 must find a way to pay for the measure			1
" i , obviously , have people in my state who would benefit			0
the better way to go is to not add to the deficit in an irresponsible way , " @entity57 said			0
sen. @entity73 , @entity74 , is one of the four republicans who said she would vote to begin debate on the bill			1
however , she would n't rule out blocking it later if cost offsets are n't added			1
" i want us to get on the bill so we can talk about an offset to pay for it			2
ultimately , i think we should restructure the unemployment compensation program so it 's more closely linked to job training for the long - term unemployed whose jobs probably are not coming back , " she said			2
the other three republicans are @entity88 of @entity89 , a co-sponsor of the bill , @entity92 of @entity93 , and @entity94 of @entity95			2
@entity25 see themselves in a win - win position on the test vote			2
they could build momentum for the bill if @entity22 back it			0
they get a political weapon if @entity22 do n't			2
seventeen senators absent in remarks just before the vote was to have been held , sen. @entity101 of @entity102 , the no. 2 @entity22 , noted that 17 members were not in the chamber and urged that the proceedings be delayed " so we can have a real debate " and decide how to pay for the extension			1
republicans and @entity25 alike were delayed by rough winter weather that plunged the @entity113 and much of the @entity114 into a deep freeze , triggering widespread travel delays			2
sen. @entity117 tweeted that his commuter flight to @entity0 returned to @entity119 shortly after takeoff due to a possible engine problem and made a safe emergency landing			0
benefits expired benefits for the long - term unemployed expired last month after @entity64 opted not to continue a 2008 recession - era law providing nearly a year of payments , footed by @entity9 taxpayers , that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out			1
@entity25 insist the program is critical to help @entity9 who are struggling and to maintain the economic recovery			0
@entity22 argue that the program -- which the @entity133 estimates would cost $ 26 billion to continue for another year -- is costly and is a disincentive to looking for work			0
the @entity9 unemployment rate stood at 7 % in november , the most recent @entity137 statistics show			0
that means more than 10 million people were out of work , a third of them without a job for at least 27 weeks			0
@entity43 : extend unemployment insurance over the weekend , key republicans , including potential 2016 presidential candidate sen. @entity146 of @entity147 , insisted that an extension must include cuts elsewhere to offset the cost			1
" i 'm opposed to having it without paying for it , " @entity146 said on @entity152 's " @entity151			0
" " i think it 's wrong to borrow money from @entity157 or simply print up money for it			0
" house speaker @entity161 will insist on such offsets before agreeing to an extension , a spokesman for the @entity22 leader said			0
@entity43 supports passage during his weekly address over the weekend , president @entity43 underscored that failing to pass an extension could result in a drag on the economy			1
new year , same old fight over jobless benefits " it actually slows down the economy for all of us			0
if folks ca n't pay their bills or buy the basics , like food and clothes , local businesses take a hit and hire fewer workers , " he said			0
while @entity10 is optimistic about reaching the 60 votes to begin debate , conservative interests are applying heavy pressure and keeping score			0
the @entity189 urged all senators to vote " no " on the proposal and cited the lack of spending offsets			2
" @entity64 should end the federal unemployment insurance program and return the authority back to the states , which already have programs in place , " the group said			1
" absent this , @entity64 should pay for this extension by cutting spending elsewhere in the budget			2
after six years , an extension can no longer be called an ' emergency ' with any credibility			0
there is plenty of waste in the federal budget from which to find an offset , " it said			0
@entity1 's @entity212 contributed to this report .			0
