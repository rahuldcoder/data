-- in the past couple months , thousands of teachers and parents have been calling for radical change in the education system , citing issues with the @entity6 policy			1
teachers , students , and parents across the country have come together with one goal in mind : fix a faulty education system			1
organizers are calling for a march on @entity17 , where they hope to inspire change			1
@entity18 is a national board - certified teacher and mentor teacher for the @entity22 , @entity23 , schools			1
he is one of the organizers of the @entity25 , set for saturday			1
he recently spoke to @entity0 about the march , its purpose and what teachers hope to gain			1
@entity0 : where did the idea for the @entity32 march come from ? @entity18 : the idea was born after president @entity34 was elected			1
teachers , especially , were tired of @entity6 and the emphasis on standardized test scores to judge students , schools and teachers			1
teachers really hoped for change			1
when we did n't see that change coming , we got concerned			2
i got involved last december with teachers , parents and professors			1
we started doing the hard work of building our coalition , strengthening our guiding principles and figuring out what we wanted instead			0
there was a lot of dissatisfaction with education policy , and we needed a positive agenda and not just be critics			0
there 's a lot of momentum building for the march , rally and conference			2
endorsements are lining up from parent organizations , students , academics and , of course , from teachers			1
people are excited about the chance to get our voices heard			0
opinion : why @entity76 's teachers are enraged @entity0 : why do the organizers feel it 's necessary to " save " our schools ? @entity18 : for the last 10 years , since @entity6 was enacted , more and more emphasis has been put on test scores			1
the underlying belief is that if we punish schools for low test scores and reward schools and teachers for high scores , then student achievement will improve			2
those who work in schools see the effects that this has had			0
the practice of labeling schools " failures " has n't worked			0
it is actually undermining public schools			0
more support is going to semi-private charter schools and flowing away from public schools			0
more money and instructional time is being spent on more complicated and sophisticated tests			0
the actual education of our students is suffering			2
teachers are demoralized ; many are leaving the profession			2
those teachers still here are taking a stance to protect schools and students from this			1
tests are not going to fix our schools			0
real solutions are needed to improve our schools , and those start with students , teachers and parents who invest in our schools			1
@entity0 : what 's the objective of this march ? @entity18 : secretary ( of education ) @entity128 sent a letter to @entity76 teachers in honor of @entity132 in which he heaped a lot of praise on teachers but at the same time made it clear that policies that are so destructive in our schools are not changing			1
the response that he got to that letter was overwhelmingly critical from teachers			2
teachers simply could not believe his praise , because at the same time @entity128 says he appreciates teachers , he has supported the firing of entire staffs			2
so there 's a real disconnect between education policy and the rhetoric that says that teachers are so valued			2
what we hope will happen as a result of this march is a recognition that there is a serious problem in education reform policies in this country , that there is serious and principled opposition to those policies and real alternatives that are actually working in schools			2
opinion : why we protest education cuts @entity0 : some teachers are afraid to appear at rallies or speak out against the status quo for fear of losing their jobs			2
have you encountered any teachers who want to participate but feel they ca n't ? @entity18 : teachers comment all the time online that they are fearful of speaking out more			1
social movements take some bravery , some guts			0
standing up in large enough numbers , that 's what it 's all about			0
only then , teachers ca n't be dismissed or discriminated against			0
it 's incumbent on all teachers who are professionals to take stock of the ethical commitment to students , and at a certain point , that commitment requires taking risks			1
the time is now to take some risks , or else the teaching profession is not worth working in			0
@entity0 : how are you looking for parents to become activists ? @entity18 : recently in my district , i worked as part of a group that brought together 200 teachers to discuss ways that we could improve teaching			1
the energy that was unleashed is the energy of activism , the energy of people taking responsibility and control of their profession			0
that energy is completely absent if you try to coerce people into doing things , if you try to bribe them with merit or punish them by saying they will lose their jobs if their test scores do n't improve			0
what teachers wanted is to improve schools and work together			0
the result ? a lot of concrete ideas on how to do this			0
parents need to do the same thing by getting involved in local schools , running for the school board			1
a social movement across this country is needed to defend neighborhood schools			0
it is n't going to happen without the parents ; it is n't going to happen without the teachers			1
it should n't happen without the students			0
everyone needs to get involved			0
the march is just one part of that			0
@entity0 : how will determine if this event has been a success ? @entity18 : if we strengthen the network of people who care about schools , we raise the profile of a positive vision for public education , we make it more difficult for the @entity255 to pretend that the majority of the teaching profession supports their policies , and we remind @entity260 and the president that there are many , many thousands of people who care deeply about the future of our schools			2
we do n't want schools sold off to corporate charters , do n't want them micromanaged by standardized tests			0
teachers , parents and students should be entrusted with the real work of reforming our schools .			1

parents , teachers , students plan @entity32 march in @entity17 on saturday
