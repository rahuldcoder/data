@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is best known for the unwavering gaze of his war photography			1
for thirty years he traveled to places most people run from , depicting horror unflinchingly and with enormous compassion for the people he captured in unimaginable situations			1
considered one of the greatest war photographers , @entity3 's pictures chart conflicts in @entity17 , @entity18 , the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 , including the @entity24 in june 1967			1
he has , as he puts it , taken " terrible liberties " with his life -- dashing through rice paddies in @entity17 to escape snipers ' bullets ; jumping up to snap a shot during gun battles -- to bring home images that are , at times , excruciating to look at but often unforgettable			1
and yet , as enduring as these images are , forgetting them is exactly what @entity3 now wants to do			1
" that war stuff ... i do n't even want to print it anymore , " he says			0
" i want to put it right out of my mind			0
" but , along with his photos of poverty , " that war stuff " has won @entity3 a handful of photography awards and filled tens of books and exhibitions across the world , including his latest , " shaped by @entity24 , " which opened friday at the @entity52 in @entity0			1
much of the photography that appears in the exhibition he shot during the 18 years he worked for the @entity58 's @entity57			1
he went to his first war in @entity60 in 1967 and covered every major conflict of his generation until the @entity63			0
the thrill of war @entity3 , now 76 , admits that at first he found war " incredibly exciting			1
" " you 've got to remember i grew up as a child looking at @entity70 films where no one seemed to die , " he says			2
he liked the thrill of making it home alive and seeing his images published even more : " i felt as if i could levitate and forget gravity as a human being -- i felt really amazing			0
" how he made it home alive is another matter			0
as @entity3 himself admits : " you ca n't learn about survival after a certain point			1
after that , it 's sheer luck really			2
" but his bravery under fire is well known			0
@entity88 , then editor of @entity89 wrote of @entity3 in @entity91 newspaper many years later : " @entity3 has the bottle			1
this is the man who , amid a fusillade of bullets , would stop to take a light reading			0
" shell shock in @entity17 in 1968 , one of @entity3 's greatest moments of " bottle " produced arguably his most celebrated image : a shell - shocked soldier in @entity17 that he photographed during a huge battle for the ancient city of @entity107			1
the battle raged for two weeks , @entity3 remembers			1
the city was being shelled constantly from navy boats in the @entity110 17 miles away , and phantom bombers were dropping napalm just a few streets from where he was			0
he said : " when you saw those napalm tumbling , carrying molten death , you 'd say to yourself , ' keep going			0
" and he did , staying with the @entity119 for the duration of the battle , during which time , he says , they lost 70 men and 300 wounded			0
@entity3 came away having taken some of the most powerful photographs of his career -- but he was left suffering combat stress , much like the soldier in his photograph			1
a personal battle @entity3 himself says he was " completely insane , " by the end of the battle			1
when he finally got back to the press center and changed and showered , he realised some remnants of that fight would be harder to get rid of			0
" i thought , you know , it ( the shower ) could cleanse the filth of war off me			0
it did n't , really , because by then it had all gotten into my brain			0
" i was sleeping next to bodies and things ( in @entity107 ) ... and then you say , ' what the hell 's this got to do with photography ? ' ' who am i ? ' ' where the hell have i just been ? ' ' what 's happened to me ? ' " @entity3 has spent many years battling the psychological after effects of war , trying to balance the quest for excellence in his work with the horrors he 's witnessed			1
" it really messes you up , " he said			0
" it 's incomprehensible the way human beings can slaughter each other in front of you			2
and you take it home with you			0
and it 's like you have n't cleaned your teeth in several months , it leaves a bad taste in your mouth			2
" @entity3 's gentle approach throughout his career , @entity3 has been driven by a search for equality			1
he puts it down to his background growing up , ill - educated and impoverished , in @entity0 's @entity183			1
that empathy comes through in his gentle approach to the victims he photographed			2
" i was very gentle with people			0
i would come to people that were injured and try to get their consent , " he says			0
" i would not be brash the way i 've seen lots of journalists operating ... pushing and shoving and having fist fights in front of victims			2
" i would seek out the chance to take my photographs and i would look at the person i was photographing and try to convey my disgust to them and i would try to bring them to me in a trusting way			0
" landscapes and ruins nowadays , @entity3 is more content photographing inanimate objects -- like the landscapes around his house in the south of @entity1			1
he says he shoots his landscapes mainly in winter because he likes the drama of the naked trees , the " threat " of winter			2
" people say my landscapes look like war scenes because i do ( print ) them very dark , " he admits			2
" but , you know , i suppose the darkness is in me , really			0
" last year , he also published " @entity220 , " a book of photographs of @entity224 ruins in the @entity23 and @entity225			1
it was inspired , he says , by a spur - of - the - moment trip to @entity228 many years ago with travel writer @entity229			2
they journeyed around and found themselves , to their surprise , in a @entity224 town " with these great slabs of granite as roadways			1
" he 's stored the memory ever since and when he wanted to do one more project and " totally get away from war " it fitted			2
of course , he says , the irony is that today war would have stopped him from going to some of the places in the book			2
" look at it [ the region ] now			0
i could n't possibly do it today with war in @entity249 and war in @entity251 , " he said			2
searching for peace mainly , though , @entity3 's current quest is for peace of mind			1
he 'll never forget the wars he 's witnessed -- " it took me all my life to try and understand , you know , why do people do this to each other and i still have n't come to any conclusions about it " -- but they do n't haunt him they way they used to			1
a far cry from the macho war photographer image , @entity3 says the thing that gave him the most joy recently was coming home after a holiday and picking some blackberries in the field behind his house			1
" i felt real human freedom , " he said			0
" just having the choice of going and picking those blackberries and ambling home and washing them			0
" it 's a funny thing to say , but you have to find your own place in the world , eventually			0
" i 've got a last chapter of my life and i want it to be enjoyable			1
i do n't want to be persecuted by myself anymore , by my guilt anymore -- i 've had all that			0
