@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is facing foreclosure			1
he 's not alone -- in @entity1 , where @entity3 lives and works , one in every 56 homes is in foreclosure			1
that simple number , from foreclosure data firm @entity8 , does n't tell the whole story , especially in @entity3 's case			1
two different law firms are pushing the foreclosure -- on the same mortgage			1
" i see now that there 's two people that are coming after me , that maybe [ the bank ] hired in this way , " he said			2
" i do n't know all the specifics , but there 's two people that are coming after me on the same loan number			2
" across the country , millions of @entity25 have lost their homes to foreclosure since the recession began in december 2007 , according to @entity8			1
increasingly , however , more of those stories are becoming horror tales about a system in chaos with banks pushing people toward foreclosure , sometimes , allegedly , based on error - filled or even fraudulent and illegal documents			1
several of the nation 's financial giants , including @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , have halted foreclosures , although @entity40 and @entity43 announced they are resuming the process			2
while the @entity48 administration opposes a moratorium on foreclosures so the process can be examined , the federal @entity46 has launched a criminal investigation to determine if the banks and their lawyers have done anything illegal			1
@entity3 's case may or may not have been handled properly , but his story is typical			2
" i bought the house 6 years ago			2
it was something i was happy with			2
it was $ 1,500 a month , " said the physical therapist and part - time fireman - paramedic			2
" i 'm a prideful man			1
i take pride in paying all my bills			2
" but then , there were a series of tragic turns			2
his young son needed three open heart surgeries as well as other surgeries to drain fluid			2
@entity3 's health insurance is good , he said , but not good enough to cover $ 1,800 per month in prescriptions , co-payments and deductibles			2
he took a loan from his retirement account			2
the low interest rate on his mortgage -- supposedly fixed for the first five years and variable after that -- nevertheless rose every year , including a $ 600 jump in year 4			1
the bank had no real answers , he said , and was n't very helpful			0
meanwhile , the bills piled up , and he started to fall behind			0
@entity3 took a 5 percent pay cut at the fire department , necessitated by the struggling economy			0
but still , he thought he could work his way out until he began calling his bank and realizing , he said , no one wanted to listen			1
" they said , ' you are a hard - working @entity25 , thank you for paying us			0
when you stop paying , now we can start working with you , ' " @entity3 said			0
" basically , do something wrong , then we 're going to work with you			0
go through your savings , go through everything , now you have nothing			0
" with my situation it 's a little more difficult because of my son 's surgeries and the medical bills which i now have to take care of , which i want to take care of , " his son 's medical bills take priority , @entity3 says			0
but that 's not easy with a big bank seeking to repossess his modest , three - bedroom townhome in @entity0 -- and two law firms to deal with			1
" in my opinion , these are hired guns			0
banks want these non-performing loans off their bottom line			0
and what do they do ? they go out and hire a foreclosure mill who 's trying to push it through as fast as possible , " said @entity3 's attorney , @entity121			1
working fast and furiously creates opportunities for mistakes , @entity121 said , and @entity1 foreclosure defense attorneys are filing complaints			1
@entity121 's @entity130 law firm , @entity129 , has taken numerous depositions where banking officials have admitted under oath they signed thousands of foreclosure - related documents every month without personally verifying them			1
one employee was signing 10,000 documents a month in some cases , the depositions revealed			1
" that 's virtually impossible , " said @entity121			0
" you have to have an army of people to review the documents necessary to prove the validity of these documents in court			1
" one of the firms foreclosing on @entity148 is the law office of @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity1			1
@entity1 's attorney general says @entity150 's foreclosure business is the largest in the state and accuses the firm of submitting false documents , even making some up , just to speed up the foreclosure process			1
the state has opened a civil investigation against several firms , including @entity150 's			1
repeated calls to @entity150 's office have not been returned			0
however , he told the @entity162 , " ... there has not been submission of fraudulent documents			1
" @entity150 said the investigation is politically motivated , adding , " we have done nothing wrong			0
" " i can tell you now that no misconduct is occurring at @entity150 's law firm , and the firm works very diligently to make sure that all the processing is done correctly , " @entity150 's attorney , @entity169 , said in a phone interview			1
but in depositions for a lawsuit against the firm , @entity150 's employees admitted , under oath , they were signing foreclosure documents so fast that they barely had time to even see who the homeowner was			1
it 's a practice known as " robo - signing			0
" in an excerpt from a deposition of @entity188 , an employee who once worked for @entity150 , she says she did not read foreclosure documents before signing them			1
" how much time do you spend examining each document before you sign them ? " asked @entity191			0
" very little , " the employee answered			0
" do you read the document ? " @entity129 asked			0
" no , " the employee answered			0
" their mill is the printer , printing off document after document after document and just having people sign them , " said @entity129 attorney @entity198			1
" they 're being paid to serve , to take the foreclosure through the process as quickly as possible , " he said			1
" the servicers actually rate them based on how quickly they move through the process			0
" and in a " foreclosure mill , " time is money			2
" ... $ 1,200 to $ 1,450 is usually what shows up on uncontested cases for attorney 's fees and costs because they 're dealing with a pro-se person who 's not challenging the different paperwork that they file in the case , " said @entity198			2
" i mean , some of these people are making a very good living doing this			0
" @entity150 has made millions			0
he owns tens of millions of dollars in homes , sports - cars and a recently purchased a 130 - foot @entity234 yacht			0
the yacht alone is estimated to be worth around $ 20 million			0
judges in numerous states have thrown out thousands of foreclosures			0
in at least six states , attorneys general are investigating , including the state of @entity241 which has also sued @entity41			1
@entity25 attorney general @entity242 has announced the @entity243 is looking into the problem , and @entity246 leaders are calling for @entity248 investigations and more			1
the investigations and lawsuits will eventually peel back the layers and determine if the foreclosures have been handled properly			0
@entity246 may set more rules so that the system operates more transparently			0
but that will all come too late for @entity3 , who has given up the fight to keep his home and reluctantly is letting it go			0
