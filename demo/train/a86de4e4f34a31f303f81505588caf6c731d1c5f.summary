-- @entity2 's centrist president - elect expressed a willingness to open dialogue with the @entity5 , which it has n't had diplomatic relations with in decades , but only if the @entity5 recognizes @entity2 's right to a nuclear program			1
@entity10 , who won the presidency over the weekend , said in his first news conference monday , however , that the @entity14 republic has no intention of ending its uranium - enrichment program			2
the program is a major impetus for the international sanctions against @entity2			2
calling relations between the @entity5 and @entity2 an " old wound " and " complicated , " @entity10 said that before there are talks , the @entity5 must first promise to never interfere with @entity2 domestic affairs and scrap its " unilateral " and " bullying policies			1
" " wisdom tells us both countries , both nations need to think more about the future and try to sit down and find solutions to past issues and rectify things , " he said			0
" the rights of the @entity2 nation , including nuclear rights , need to be recognized			1
" " we are prepared to see tensions alleviated , " he added , noting that any talks " should be based on mutual respect and interest and equal footing			0
" in opening his news conference , @entity10 , 65 , said repairing @entity2 's economy and engaging in more dialogue -- both at home and abroad -- will be his administration 's top priorities			1
dialogue and the economy are related , as @entity2 faces sharp international sanctions over its nuclear program , but @entity10 said he foresees a " fresh opportunity for interaction at the global level			1
" mutual trust and transparency are key to the international community lifting sanctions , which he called " brutal , and the people of @entity2 have done nothing wrong to deserve sanctions			2
" " making use of the lever of sanctions , this is not the right time for that			0
... even in the @entity71 , they are facing economic problems and dilemmas , and they themselves know the sanctions are to the detriment of the @entity71 , " @entity10 said , adding that @entity68 was the only country benefiting from them			1
" we can make it clear to the whole world that the measures and activities of the @entity14 republic are totally within international regulations and mechanisms			0
" @entity10 did not elaborate on how he would make the country 's nuclear program more transparent , but he insisted that the @entity2 nuclear program was lawful			1
he also voiced opposition to international " meddling " in domestic affairs			0
while @entity10 encouraged @entity2 to act with " unity and solidarity " as it transitions to his promised moderate rule in coming weeks , he said his primary goals will be " acting in line with salvaging the country 's economy , reviving morality and constructive interaction with the world			1
" he said he could not yet provide time lines but said he would first like to ensure that @entity2 had basic commodities before his government pursues " the tranquility and stability of the economy			0
" this will require embracing " moderation and justice , and not extremism and egoism , " he said			2
" electoral promises , i will not forget them , so i beseech the almighty @entity112 to give me the opportunity to materialize all those promises			0
" @entity10 said he would convene groups to discuss the best ways to improve the country 's social , cultural and economic affairs			2
" as far as practice , that job will be delegated to the people themselves , " he said			0
after his victory was announced over the weekend , @entity10 spoke of reforms without threatening @entity2 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity127 , or the country 's institutions -- of which he is a product			1
the former national security council chief promised greater personal freedoms and said he would free political prisoners and jailed journalists			0
@entity68 prime minister @entity135 has already cautioned the world against easing such sanctions in the face of @entity10 's promises			1
" regarding the results of the elections in @entity2 , let us not delude ourselves			0
the international community must not become caught up in wishes and be tempted to relax the pressure on @entity2 to stop its nuclear program , " @entity135 said at a weekly @entity144 meeting			1
the prime minister also said @entity2 's supreme leader " disqualified candidates who did not fit his extremist outlook			1
" in his campaigning , @entity10 pledged to improve the economy and unemployment			0
as a former nuclear negotiator , he said , he would reduce the high tension between @entity2 and the outside world by addressing the sanctions			2
in a message through the semiofficial @entity161 , @entity10 said the win " is the victory of wisdom , moderation , growth and awareness , the victory of commitment and religiosity over extremism and ill tempers			2
" reaction from the @entity71 -- including that of @entity175 , the @entity5 and @entity176 -- revolved around calls for @entity10 to keep his promises to steer @entity2 in a new direction			1
the @entity5 " remains ready to engage the @entity2 government directly in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community 's concerns about @entity2 's nuclear program , " the @entity179 said			1
while the @entity179 respected the vote , it said the election occurred " against the backdrop of a lack of transparency , censorship of the media , @entity193 , and text messages , and an intimidating security environment that limited freedom of expression and assembly			0
" @entity10 succeeds outgoing president @entity199 , who was term - limited and could not run in the election			2
but @entity10 wo n't be @entity2 's most powerful man			1
that distinction belongs to @entity127 , who has been @entity2 's supreme leader since 1989			1
he 's got plenty of backing , from conservative citizens to loyalist militia groups to , most notably , the @entity206			0
on his website , the supreme leader said @entity10 is the president of all @entity2 and told supporters of various candidates to set aside their differences and unify			2
@entity10 has all - round credentials in @entity2 's institutions , including as a senior cleric and former commander of @entity2 air defenses , and he is an intellectual with three law degrees , including from a university in @entity220			1
he has a reputation for shunning extreme positions and bridging differences			0
while he has represented @entity127 on @entity2 's security council since 1989 , he has avoided being perceived as a pushover and has taken exception with the supreme leader on being too rigid toward the international community , according to an @entity2 scholar at @entity230			2
he has also accused state - run media of censorship and publishing lies			0
prior to @entity10 's election , @entity2 's @entity236 , an unelected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader , drew up the restricted list of candidates from the 680 who initially registered			1
eight candidates were approved , two of whom subsequently dropped out			0
the final six contenders did n't include any women			0
nor did they include @entity199 's aide and protege @entity249 , who was among those excluded by the @entity236			0
@entity0 's @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity5 must respect @entity2 's nuclear rights before talks can begin , @entity10 says
the @entity71 knows sanctions do n't work , he says ; they benefit only @entity68
@entity2 's president - elect : nuclear program lawful , but more transparency needed
@entity271 will pursue policies of " moderation and justice , and not extremism and egoism "
