-- in the last 30 - plus years , @entity1 has helped found @entity2 , became a successful producer , headed @entity6 's @entity5 theme parks division , ran the @entity8 real estate company , took over @entity9 in its formative years and was chief operating officer of the merged @entity6			1
now he 's getting back to his roots : radio			1
three years after making an investment in the sometimes maligned @entity14 , the largest radio company in the @entity15 , he 's the ceo			1
in a phone interview with @entity0 , his @entity17 twang contrasting with his rapid - fire delivery , @entity1 talked about why he got back into radio , his responses to criticism of @entity14 and lessons he 's learned during his career , which started at a radio station in @entity25 , @entity17 , when @entity1 was 15			1
the following is an edited and condensed version of the interview : @entity0 : why do this ? @entity1 : as i began looking at the company a couple years ago , i was stunned to find the real facts			1
by reading the press , i thought that radio was somehow in trouble and was following the path of television and having all sorts of fragmentation problems , and nothing could be further from the truth			2
it 's been remarkably stable			2
and when i looked at technology , i looked at it as an opportunity , not a risk			2
@entity0 : in recent years , with voice - tracking and consolidation of personnel , @entity14 has seemed to become less local			1
do you want to bring it back to its local base ? @entity1 : i think it is still local , and i think people have misinterpreted what we 're doing if people think we 're making things less local			1
we 're still providing the news and the weather and the emergency services and local contests , local promotions , etc. what we 're able to do now is we 're able to tap into a lot of talent we 've got nationally			0
we have the ability for the person from a remote studio to still talk about the town , and we have local people in the town who are directing the person as to what 's important and developing those local relationships			2
@entity78 is still paramount to us and very important to making a radio station a radio station			2
@entity0 : there were cutbacks over @entity83			0
how does that fit in with the overall plan ? @entity1 : actually , our head count has not gone down as a company			1
technology has changed the way we work and where we need our people			2
we 've built an entire national advertising sales and marketing and partnership group			0
we 've added technology groups , an entire digital group			1
the way we 're doing business today is trying to reflect the way people are living			0
it 's one of the problems with any company started after the @entity104 -- you really have to go in and adjust it to new technology			1
@entity0 : there are all kinds of other technologies jockeying with radio			2
how do you compete against them ? @entity1 : we do n't compete with that			1
i think again you 've got to go back and look at what radio is			2
radio is very different from someone 's music collection , and the two have always co-existed very well together			1
your music collection is really where you curate music exactly for you at that moment you 're living , and you do n't want any interruptions			0
radio is actually the exact opposite			0
yes , we play music , ( but ) turning on the radio is like walking into your favorite bar where everybody knows you and you know them , and you say , " what 's up ? " so we tell you about new music , we play new music , we 've got gossip , we 've got call - ins , we 've got listeners on the air , we 've got contests , we 've got jokes			1
you hit your favorite personality who is really like your best friend			0
people have always had music collections ( and ) always had radio			0
@entity0 : how does ( @entity14 's website ) iheartradio fit in ? @entity1 : what we want is to find more listening occasions			1
about 30 % of the listening to stations on @entity156 is done to stations outside their markets			0
if you 're sitting in @entity25 , @entity17 , and you want to find out what 's going on in @entity166 , you might tune in to @entity160 , the same way when i was a kid growing up in @entity25 , @entity17 , i listened to @entity162 in @entity163 because i was fascinated to listen to a slice of the big city			0
in addition to that , we do the custom radio stations , like a @entity172 -- a playlist creator -- and @entity174 , playlists created for certain activities			0
we also have @entity177 deeply embedded in @entity156 , which allows people to share what they 're doing , so it becomes a social experience as well			0
in terms of the digital revolution we 're way behind , but we do think it 's a terrific opportunity for us			1
@entity0 : what are the positives and negatives about being the 800 - pound gorilla ? @entity1 : we 're no. 1 in all media			1
just our radio ( stations ) reach 239 million people a month			0
but when people call you an evil empire , what they 're saying is , you 're not doing anything new and exciting			0
and i think the opposite side of having a big platform to play with is you can do great stuff			0
we try to be very attuned to what 's important to our listeners , and we have an obligation to help our listeners and help our communities			0
and we view part of our job is to connect the music to the fans			0
that 's what radio does			1
@entity0 : what are some of the lessons you 've learned in your career ? @entity1 : the good news is i 've been in a lot of different industries			1
i spent many years in the internet business , i was there at the birth of the national cable networks , i 've been an advertiser			0
( the late @entity6 chief ) @entity228 taught me to take chances -- do n't ever think you 've arrived			0
( @entity233 ) @entity232 gave me great lessons about controlling costs and making sure you 're really getting a return on your money			0
we funded our digital growth and these great initiatives by getting rid of some things that were legacy that were n't applicable to operations today			1
it 's constantly being in touch both with the consumer and being realistic as to where technology is today and where we need to be allocating our resources .			2
