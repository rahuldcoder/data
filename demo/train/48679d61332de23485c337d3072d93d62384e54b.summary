" implemented last month , after president @entity27 signed it into law , it bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it -- and has been condemned by @entity2 and international rights groups as highly discriminatory			1
as @entity2 prepares to host the @entity6 in the resort city of @entity38 , there is also great concern about what the legislation will mean for gay athletes and visitors to the country			1
the debate was stirred up this week by @entity47 politician @entity46 , who implemented a local , earlier version of the propaganda law in his city			1
amid word that @entity2 would not enforce the law during the @entity6 , he said that all @entity2 laws should be enforced there , regardless of who is breaking them			1

he repeated the comments when he spoke with @entity65 on wednesday			0
to boycott , or not boycott ? @entity66 described the anti-gay propaganda law as " a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in @entity2			1
" under the guise of protecting children , it will infringe on people 's rights to free expression and discriminate against @entity2 's @entity77 community , it said , as the bill was being debated			2
the move should be set against a backdrop of increased attacks in @entity2 on members of the @entity77 community and gay rights activists , it pointed out			2
there have been conflicting calls from gay rights activists over a suggested boycott of the @entity6			2
while some activists back a boycott , others argue that such a step would be counterproductive			0
@entity94 - based company @entity93 , which supports gay sport , is among those opposed to an @entity98 boycott , saying critics should focus on putting pressure on @entity2 's government rather than denying athletes their chance to compete			1
" instead of walking away , @entity77 athletes and their nations should march into @entity38 holding their heads high , " an article on the @entity93 website said			0
the @entity109 issued a statement wednesday in response to the furor , saying the @entity2 government had given assurances that gay visitors would not be affected by the controversial law			1
" @entity117 themselves should be open to all , free of discrimination , and that applies to spectators , officials , media and of course athletes			0
we would oppose in the strongest terms any move that would jeopardise this principle , " it said			0
" to that end , the @entity109 has received assurances from the highest level of government in @entity2 that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the @entity117			1
" @entity138 , the @entity94 national governing body for athletics , is treating the matter as a safety and security issue , spokeswoman @entity137 told @entity65			2
but , she said , the @entity144 has guaranteed it will not affect the athletes in any way			2
the @entity144 has not yet responded to @entity65 's requests for comment			2

@entity161 ceo @entity160 sent an open letter last week condemning the recent laws and reaffirming the brand 's commitment to the lgbt community			0
" we fully support and endorse your objectives to fight against prejudice in @entity2 , " @entity160 wrote			0
" in the past decade , ( we have ) been actively advocating in favor of freedom , tolerance and openness in society , standing very passionately on the side of the lgbt community and will continue to support any effective initiative in that direction			0
" a rainbow block of text boasting that the brand " stands strong and proud with the global lgbt community against the attitude and actions of the @entity2 government " now dominates the @entity161 homepage			0
@entity160 added that @entity161 is made from @entity2 ingredients , but the brand is " privately owned by @entity189 , headquartered in @entity190 in the heart of @entity192			0
" in another protest move , a petition was set up friday on the @entity196 's " @entity204 " website calling on @entity94 secretary of state @entity197 to put @entity46 and member of parliament @entity198 on the " visa ban list " for their role in promoting anti-gay legislation			0
@entity198 was " responsible for the federal law banning gay ' propaganda ' to minors and for the law banning foreign adoptions of @entity2 orphans by gays and lesbians , " the petition states			1
it had more than 5,500 signatures as of thursday			0
another @entity196 petition , with a few hundred signatories , calls for a @entity94 boycott of the @entity6 " due to discrimination by @entity220 against @entity77			0
