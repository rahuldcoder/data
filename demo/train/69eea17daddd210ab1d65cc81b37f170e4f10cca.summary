-- do you live in one of the nation 's worst cities for road rage ? if you live in a major metropolitan area on either coast , chances are you do			1
if you live in the @entity10 or northwest , odds are that you do n't			1
@entity11 ranks as the worst city for most aggressive drivers for the second straight year in a nationwide study of driver habits followed by @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
but if road rage is a " cultural phenomenon " as one of our experts suggests , how best do we go about combating driver frustration across the nation ? traffic black spots the nation 's roads are peppered with traffic black spots , junctions where car snarls elicit road rage in even the most mild - mannered drivers			1
@entity36 has the @entity38 ( @entity37 , and the nation 's busiest junction , where @entity41 101 meets it to the north of @entity18			2
@entity11 and the @entity43 have @entity44 , which snakes from the world 's busiest cruise port up to @entity47			1
the @entity19 and the @entity48 are infamous for gridlock			2
i 've spent three very nervous hours getting to @entity52 's @entity51 from the city center ( before missing my flight )			2
traffic by definition is worst in major metropolitan areas -- if your farming community is gridlocked , you 'd better be grousing at your local council meetings -- but it is the increase in traffic that leads many to suggest it 's just going to get worse			1
traffic levels are rising seemingly as fast as home foreclosures in @entity18 and @entity11			1
in these areas , it 's not only the rise in number of drivers , but the rising age of drivers			2
@entity74 points out that seniors are the fastest growing demographic in the @entity41 that suggests drivers should adjust their habits accordingly			1
@entity74 has launched its @entity80 campaign to help seniors adjust to more crowded roads and perhaps more aggressive drivers			1
the facts and remedy when the @entity87 studied more than 10,000 incidents of road rage and violent aggressive driving committed in the 1990s , it found that at least 218 people were killed and another 12,610 injured when drivers got angry			1
many of these aggressors are males aged 18 to 26			0
the @entity74 web site offers a three - step plan to avoid becoming the victim of aggressive driving : the first tip is " do n't offend , " which includes cutting off other drivers , driving slowly in the left lane , tailgating and gesturing to other drivers			1
the agency then warns to " not engage , " which advises steering clear of trouble , not making eye contact and getting help , by calling 911 , in the event of experiencing dangerous , aggressive driving			1
it then asks at - risk drivers to " adjust their attitude , " which involves " forgetting winning " ( for the drivers to whom driving is a @entity116 survival of the fittest ) , or putting themselves in the other drivers ' shoes			0
finally , they recommend that , if you think you have a road rage problem , seek professional help			1
other people 's actions so the wife and i were looking for sofas			0
it was a sunday morning and , with me behind the wheel , we were dawdling around quiet streets trying to find one of those seemingly ubiquitous furniture warehouses			0
soon , the wife pointed one out but we were almost past it			0
i hit the brakes and quickly pulled in , then realized that a @entity137 had pulled in right behind me			0
a large , squat tattooed guy jumped out and started shouting , about 10 feet from my car			0
" i have children in the car , i had to slam on the brakes , [ how dare ] you brake so quickly , " he said , getting real mean			0
i appreciated i 'd probably braked quickly and that it was bad driving on my part			0
however , as his tirade continued , i very calmly asked why he was setting such a bad example for his young children by following another driver off the road , then shouting and swearing			1
the man continued his harangue before climbing back into his vehicle and driving away			2
the next time you 're fulminating in your front seat about another 's aggressive driving , remember that your driving will almost inevitably elicit the same response in someone else			2
and do n't swear in front of your kids or set a bad example for them			2
' cultural phenomenon ' dr. @entity172 is a professor of psychology at the @entity174 and web master of @entity176			2
he is also the co-author of " @entity177 and @entity178 " with this wife , @entity179			0
@entity172 began studying driving psychology about 20 years ago after his wife told him her mother thought he took turns too fast			0
over a period of self - study , he said he was amazed by the mistakes he made and the aggressive thoughts he experienced toward other drivers			0
he recorded them via his " @entity191 " method			0
using his method on students , he discovered that road rage is a " cultural phenomenon			1
" " we call the back seat of the car the ' road rage nursery ' , where [ young children ] pick up all the driver 's bad habits , " @entity172 said			1
" it 's a cultural temper tantrum			0
" @entity172 said " local norms " can play a part			0
for example , @entity207 drivers yell at each other more than in @entity36 , where verbal interplay can be interpreted as road rage in a criminal court			1
but , in the main , it 's " drivers trying to deal with their emotions in stressful situations			0
" @entity172 said that , in his studies , an awareness gap exists in aggressive drivers : when asked about drivers ' habits , respondents suggested that about 85 percent of other drivers drove aggressively , while just 35 percent said they themselves drove aggressively			0
if you feel your blood boiling frequently behind the wheel , classes like @entity172 ' are sprouting all over the nation			0
addressing road rage in an ideal world , an increase in drivers would automatically be met by an improvement in infrastructure , and fewer road - rage - inducing distractions			1
another utopian ideal is for everyone else to drive more considerately			0
one look at our nation 's crumbling roads tells us that this fantasyland clearly does n't exist			2
instead of looking outside your car at road conditions or the habits of other drivers , the answer to aggressive driving , most likely , lies within the confines of your own cabin			2

traffic snarls blamed for causing much of road rage
road rage worse in big cities on @entity43 , @entity263 coasts
@entity74 : do n't engage the angry driver , dial 911 for help
professor : back seat is " road rage nursery "
