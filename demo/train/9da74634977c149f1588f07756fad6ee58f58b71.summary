bringing supplies to astronauts on the @entity2 can be a little screwy , leaving astronauts waiting for the next costly and risky resupply mission			0
this week , thanks to 3 - d printing , astronaut and @entity2 commander @entity8 had a wrench he needed manufactured by a printer in just four hours			1
the ratcheting socket wrench was the first " uplink tool " printed in space , according to @entity13 , marketing and communications manager for @entity18 , which built the printer in partnership with @entity21			1
the tool was designed on the ground , emailed to the space station and then manufactured			0
from start to finish , the process took less than a week			0
made in @entity30 's @entity29 printer is the first to operate in zero gravity , and printed its first object in orbit -- a part for the printer , ironically -- in november			2
" this means that we could go from having a part designed on the ground to printed in orbit within an hour to two from start to finish , " @entity40 , @entity21 's @entity29 print manager , said in a press release when the printer was sent to the @entity2 in september			1
" the on - demand capability can revolutionize the constrained supply chain model we are limited to today and will be critical for exploration missions			0
" the goal for the project is to create in - space manufacturing , especially as missions venture farther from @entity52			1
@entity30 , the final frontier for @entity29 printing ultimately , @entity13 said the wrench and other objects will be sent back to assess whether there are any functional differences between those samples printed in space versus those on the ground .			2

a wrench is first " uplink tool " designed on @entity52 then emailed and printed in space
made in @entity30 partnered with @entity21 to send a 3 - d printer to @entity2
goal is in - space manufacturing , especially as missions venture farther from @entity52
