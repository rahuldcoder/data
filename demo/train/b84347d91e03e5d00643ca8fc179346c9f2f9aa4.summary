@entity0 is back on a podium			1
true , @entity0 has barely been away from one			2
just ask @entity3 , who lost a tooth when a camera hit him in the face while cheering @entity0 onto the podium in @entity8 last month			1
but tuesday 's podium was special			0
it marked the ski superstar 's first medal at a @entity13 in four years			1
the 30 - year - old came to this year 's @entity13 , in @entity15 , @entity16 , having just set the all - time record for wins on the regular , season - long @entity20 circuit			2
and she maintained some of that momentum to finish third in tuesday 's super-g , her opening event , behind @entity26 's @entity25 and victorious @entity28 @entity27			1
@entity27 won with a time of 1:10.29 in windy conditions , becoming the first woman to win back - to - back @entity32 and world @entity33 titles			1
before @entity27 's run , @entity0 had temporarily led the field with 1:10.44			1
not that @entity0 celebrated her return to a major podium too wildly			2
" i thought i skied pretty well , " said the bronze medalist			0
" i 'm happy with the result			0
i just wish the weather was a little bit better			0
" golfer @entity3 , undaunted by his dental disaster last month , once again turned up to support @entity0			1
his girlfriend last won a world medal in 2011 -- downhill silver in @entity47 , @entity48 -- and previously won both the super-g and downhill world titles in 2009			1
she also took @entity32 downhill gold and super-g bronze at the @entity54			2
however , @entity0 missed @entity55 2014 through injury			2
she crashed and tore ligaments racing in the super-g at the @entity59 , then re-injured her knee in a training accident later that year			0
" sometimes good skiing is enough to overcome the weather , " she added following this year 's third - place finish			0
" sometimes it 's not			0
today , it was n't enough			0
" but i have to say , @entity27 skied exceptionally well			0
she definitely deserved to win the gold medal today			0
" @entity0 remains the favorite for friday 's downhill			1
meanwhile , 37 - year - old compatriot @entity71 is set to race in wednesday 's men 's super-g , despite only having completed training runs since undergoing back surgery three months ago .			1

@entity27 wins super-g world title with @entity0 third
