-- not surprisingly , the @entity1 last weekend saw heated debates on @entity3 and its current political crisis			1
yet while government and opposition representatives faced off with their well - known positions , the real news was an apparent change of minds among @entity12 leaders			2
thus , @entity14 commissioner @entity13 stated that " if we are serious about helping this part of @entity18 to transform , the association agreement is only the first step , " admitting in effect that only the @entity14 's " most powerful instrument " , membership , will help in the long - term			2
@entity14 foreign policy chief @entity24 added that @entity18 and the @entity27 are " developing a plan -- a @entity26 " , whose numbers " wo n't be small " , to provide urgently needed short - term funding to @entity3 's battered economy			1
and @entity27 secretary of state @entity31 stressed that " nowhere is the fight for a democratic , @entity18 future more important today than in @entity3 "			1
taken together , the three statements may signal a major shift in @entity12 policy vis - a - vis @entity3			1
this much - needed reset comes after months of inaction by both @entity18 and the @entity27 when back in november , @entity3 rose against their government 's decision to abandon closer ties with the @entity14 , senior @entity18 leaders were quick to arrive in @entity43 to show their solidarity with the protesters			1
the enthusiastic response that met them at the @entity48 , however , faded quickly when @entity18 concerns remained lip - service			0
the @entity27 acted even more half - heartedly when its secretary of state avoided a possible visit to @entity43 , sending a deputy instead to hand out buns to freezing democrats			1
western indecision clearly played its role in aggravating the political crisis in @entity3 , as it emboldened the government of @entity60 while driving protesters to despair			2
as a result , the former essentially attempted to legalize dictatorial rule and , when this prompted further demonstrations , resorted to violence by riot police			0
the latter , in turn , have only become more resolved but find it increasingly hard to retain unity , moderation and non-violence			0
within a few weeks , this has brought @entity3 to the brink of civil war , and any further escalation will have unforeseeable consequences not just for @entity3 but for the entire region and @entity18 itself			0
this must have finally dawned on @entity12 leaders			0
immediate truce however , the measures indicated by @entity84 , @entity24 and @entity31 are neither enough nor even the most pressing ones			0
as a first step , @entity18 and the @entity27 must make sure of an end to violence and demand an immediate truce among all conflicting parties			0
this suspension of open conflict must also involve restraint on part of the @entity95 , @entity60 's main sponsor , who should be reminded that covert operations by @entity99 operatives or threats of a military intervention are as disruptive and unacceptable as @entity103 's economic stranglehold on @entity3			0
secondly , a long - term monitoring mission of the @entity105 , of which @entity3 and @entity99 , all @entity14 countries and the @entity27 are members , must be installed swiftly			1
the mandate of this mission should be the observation of the ceasefire , ongoing @entity48 protests , police actions and possible provocations , enquiries into recent violence , deaths and disappearances , and regular reporting on findings to the international community			0
thirdly , the @entity12 should impress upon all sides involved that only a genuine national dialogue can pave the way for a political solution of the crisis			0
such a roundtable must include president @entity60 personally and key opposition figures , the leaders of the @entity48 and @entity3 's oligarchs , as well as representatives of churches , civil society , media and the country 's diverse regions			2
the @entity14 may volunteer a senior leader to facilitate this dialogue			0
in an accompanying measure , fourthly , the @entity14 and the @entity27 should prepare a credible set of sanctions against anyone that hinders the truce , international monitoring , or national dialogue			1
any obstructions of this process , whether by government representatives , law enforcement officials , oligarchs , provocateurs or radical protesters , need to be systematically recorded and answered with visa bans , asset freezes , embargoes against businesses , and criminal persecution			0
once these immediate steps have been taken , and hopefully prevented @entity3 from further sinking into civic strife , the @entity12 must provide @entity3 with a long - term perspective of development and assistance			1
along with commissioner @entity13 's recognition last weekend , the @entity14 must give @entity3 a clear prospect of membership , dependent only on the country 's commitment to democracy , rule of law , and market economy			1
' @entity26 ' in order for necessary reforms to start and succeed , the @entity14 and the @entity27 have to swiftly roll out a " @entity26 " , as alluded to by @entity24			1
a comprehensive aid package must combine emergency funding to prevent an impending default of @entity3 , compensations for a likely economic retaliation by @entity99 , and assistance for broader market reforms			1
both these ingredients have long been missing from @entity12 offers to @entity3 , and it is partly for this reason that the country 's government turned its back on @entity18			2
by adding them now , the @entity14 and @entity27 would substantially improve their proposal			2
this should make it much easier for @entity3 's elites and society to agree on a democratic and @entity18 future for their country			0
such a consensus would go a long way towards ending the current conflict			0
for this , however , @entity3 needs the @entity12 to act swiftly and decisively			2

there have been protests in @entity3 since @entity43 *rejected* an @entity14 trade deal last november
the *unrest* was the subject of debate at the @entity1 last weekend
@entity211 says @entity14 and @entity27 comments there signify a change in @entity12 policy
