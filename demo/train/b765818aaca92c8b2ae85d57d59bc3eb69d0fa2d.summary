@entity7 -- girlfriend of @entity10 's starting quarterback and subject of @entity2 's on - air fawning during the @entity10 's 42 - 14 thrashing of @entity13 on monday night -- told @entity15 's " today " that @entity2 is getting a bum rap			1
" i think the media has been really unfair to him , " she told the @entity15 show on wednesday morning			2
" if he would have said something along the lines of that we were hot or sexy , or made any derogatory statements like that , that would have been different			0
" but the fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous , i do n't see why any woman would n't be flattered by that			2
i think they 've been a little bit unfair to him , and so i do n't take any offense to it at all			0
" during monday 's game , an @entity37 camera focused on @entity7 , a former @entity39 who is dating @entity10 quarterback @entity41			1
she was in the stands , sitting next to @entity41 's mother -- and @entity46 's river of compliments began			2
" now when you are a quarterback at @entity10 , you see that lovely lady there , she does go to @entity52 , i want to admit that , but she 's also @entity54 and that 's @entity41 's girlfriend , ok ? " the @entity37 play - by - play man said			1
" wow , i 'm telling you , quarterbacks -- you get all the good - looking women			0
what a beautiful woman , " @entity2 continued			2
" whoa ! if you 're a youngster at @entity10 , start getting the football out and throw it around the back yard with pops			2
" opinion : give @entity2 a break in the middle of that , @entity2 's broadcasting partner , @entity65 , added : " wow ! @entity68 is doing some things right down in @entity70			1
" the 73 - year - old @entity2 attracted some derision on social media , with some @entity74 posters calling his comments " creepy			1
" on tuesday , @entity37 said " we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far , and @entity2 understands that			1
" @entity7 told " today " she 's flattered by the attention -- her @entity74 following rose from 526 on december 26 to more than 233,000 on wednesday , according to the stats site @entity83			1
is @entity10 college football 's new dynasty ? @entity7 , a 2011 @entity86 graduate , said it took her a while to find out what was happening , because her phone had stopped working before the game			1
" during the game , a few of my friends sitting beside me kind of turned around and were like , ' oh my gosh , @entity95 , look what 's on the @entity97 , ' " she told " today			1
" but she said that attention needs to start swinging back to @entity10 's football team , which won its third national title in four years			1
" i think that we need to draw back our attention to who the real winners are , and that 's that @entity10 football team , " she told " today			1
" " they 've spent so long getting ready for this season			0
" another woman whom @entity2 helped lift to fame -- @entity112 , subject of the sportscaster 's on - air compliments more than seven years ago -- told @entity0 wednesday that @entity2 is a great guy who just comments on what his producers give him			1
@entity112 was one of three scantily clad football fans whom @entity119 showed during a broadcast of a @entity122 football game in 2005			2
at that moment , @entity2 said that " 1,500 red - blooded @entity123 just decided to apply " to the school			2
@entity112 went on to appear in @entity125 and @entity126 , and took a job as stadium host for @entity130 football games			0
later , quarterback @entity131 got in trouble for sending her lurid messages while he was a @entity130 player			0
" i think ( @entity46 ) is a really great guy , " @entity112 told @entity0 's " starting point with @entity136 " on wednesday			0
" maybe he went a little bit overboard ( on monday ) and got carried away , but what else was he supposed to be talking about ? did you see the score of that game ? " would she give any advice to @entity7 ? " everybody walks different			0
it 's not my place or anyone else 's place to make a decision what she 's going to do with it , " @entity112 said			0
" i think she 's got a great head on her shoulders			0
... it 's her journey			0
" embrace it and have fun along the way			0
do n't get too wrapped up in it			0
" @entity0 's @entity161 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
