it took only moments to feel the impact of what was happening here			2
we had just landed in @entity5 , the capital of @entity6			1
in the fields right outside the airport , a young woman was in tears			2
she started to wail and shout in @entity11 , one of the 40 languages spoken in this tiny country of 12 million people			1
the gathered crowd became silent and listened intently			2
the young man sitting next to me quietly translated , although i already had my suspicions			2
he told me the woman 's husband had died of @entity22 , and then quickly ushered us away			1
it is probably not surprising the airplane bringing us into @entity5 was nearly empty , as are all the hotels here			1
not many people in the @entity28 have ever visited @entity6 , or could even identify where it sits in @entity31			1
it is already one of the world 's poorest countries , and the panic around @entity22 is only making that worse			1
some of it is justified			2
that 's because this time , the outbreak is different			1
in the past , @entity22 rarely made it out of the remote forested areas of @entity31			1
key to that is a grim version of good news / bad news : because @entity22 tends to incapacitate its victims and kill them quickly , they rarely have a chance to travel and spread the disease beyond their small villages			1
now , however , @entity22 is in @entity5 , the capital city , with 2 million residents			1
equally concerning : it 's just a short distance from where we touched down , at an international airport			2
it has gone " viral , " and now the hope is that it does n't go global			1
ebola : what you need to know when i asked doctors on the ground about that scenario , they had split opinions			2
several told me the concern is real but unlikely			0
most patients with @entity22 come from small villages in the forest and are unlikely to be flying on international trips , they told me			1
furthermore , they do n't think @entity22 would spread widely in a western country ; our medical expertise and our culture -- not touching the dead -- would prevent it			1
others are n't so sure			1
no one wants to test that theory			0
who : @entity22 outbreak one of ' most challenging ' with @entity22 , there is an incubation period of two to 21 days			1
this is the range of time it takes to develop symptoms after someone has been exposed			0
with an international airport close by , that means you could be on the other side of the world before you develop the headache , fever , fatigue and joint pain which make up the early symptoms of an @entity22 infection			1
the diarrhea , rash and bleeding come later			0
hiccups is a particularly grave sign with @entity22			1
it means your diaphragm , which allows you to breathe , is starting to get irritated			0
there is a lot we know about @entity22 , and it scares us almost as much as what we do n't know			1
we do know @entity22 , a simple virus with a small genome , is a swift , effective and bloody killer			1
the mortality rate is higher than 50 % and in some outbreaks reaches 90 %			0
@entity22 appears to kill in a clever way			1
early on , it strategically disarms your immune system , allowing the virus to replicate unchecked until it invades organs all over your body			2
it convinces your blood to clot in overdrive , but only inside your blood vessels			0
while those blood vessels choke up , the rest of your body starts to ooze because the clotting mechanisms are all busy			0
you start to hemorrhage on the outside of your body			0
nose bleeds , bruising , even a simple needle stick will refuse to clot			2
but , it is the bleeding you do n't see -- the bleeding on the inside -- that causes even more catastrophic problems			2
many patients die of shock , within an average of 10 days			0
what is ebola ? it sounds like the stuff of horror movies			0
but despite the real danger , @entity22 is not at all easy to " catch			1
" if it were , my wife would have refused to let me come in the midst of an outbreak			2
to become infected , you generally need to spend extended time with someone who is gravely ill , and come into contact with his or her infected body fluids			0
that 's why family members and health care workers are the most likely to get sick			0
over the last three weeks , at least 112 people have died , including 14 health care workers			0
with some infections , you can shed and spread the virus long before you get ill. that 's not the case with @entity22			1
it 's only after you are sick and feverish do you become contagious			0
however , it only takes a miniscule amount to infect and kill			0
a microscopic droplet of blood or saliva on your bare hand could enter through a break in your skin			0
and , whether you realize it or not , we all have breaks in our skin			0
since i was a kid , i have been fascinated with outbreaks			0
i learned in medical school that new pathogens generally make a jump from animals to humans , a process called zoonosis			0
this is happening in areas where human and animals come into continuous contact			0
@entity190 refers to it as " spillover , " in his book of the same name			0
a stew of ducks , geese , chickens , pigs and humans in southeast @entity201 led to the spillover of avian flu , @entity203			0
contact between pigs and humans in @entity205 led to swine flu , @entity206 ; pigs and fruit bats were the recipe for @entity211 fever in @entity212			0
the best guess is that fruit bats may be a natural reservoir for the ebola virus too , but this has not been confirmed			2
@entity190 makes the point : @entity22 did n't enter our world -- we entered its world			1
pathogens can be predators , like lions , tigers and bears			0
a virus may not plan the way a big cat does , but in a sense it stalks its prey -- waiting for the moment of opportunity , then attacking with fury			2
because it can lie silent for years , it 's also easy to see @entity22 as a killing ghost , like @entity237			1
presumably outbreaks begin through some human - animal contact , but since that contact is ongoing we do n't know what it is that leads @entity22 to rear its ugly head			1
we do n't know how to treat the illness or vaccinate against it			2
we certainly do n't know how to cure it			2
i thought about all of this as i left that woman in the airport , and i have thought about her a great deal since then			0
her grief made an impression on all of us			0
it also made this mysterious , exotic virus the world knows , but does n't fully understand , so much more real and frightening			1
for the next 21 days ( the outer range of the incubation period ) the woman we saw will be monitored for a fever or any early signs she may have contracted @entity22 from her husband			1
if she exhibits symptoms , she will be isolated and treated with fluids , oxygen and nutrition			0
that is all that can really be offered			0
again , there is no cure for @entity22			1
for her neighbors , in @entity6 and across its border , another critical number is 42 -- as in 42 days , or two incubation periods			1
if the health care teams here do n't see any new cases during that time then they officially say the outbreak is over			1
we are not there yet , not even close			0

dr. @entity287 is in @entity6 *reporting* on the @entity22 outbreak
@entity22 has spread to @entity5 , the capital city with 2 million residents
it has gone " viral , " and now the hope is that it does n't go global , @entity287 says
@entity22 , a simple virus with a small genome , is a swift and bloody killer
