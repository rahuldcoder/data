that 's what you 'll see on the front page of any leading e-commerce site in @entity7			1
there 's a maddening array of banner ads , rows upon rows of links , icons touting promotions and discounts			0
it 's a jarring user interface that seems to bring out the worst in web design			1
and it was designed that way			0
" they want this shopping atmosphere , " says @entity19 , chairman and founder of @entity21 , one of @entity7 's leading online retailers			1
" our consumers like a page that is very crowded , busy with a lot of links so they can open lots of windows at the same time			0
" @entity31 , @entity7 tech investor and former ceo of e-commerce giant @entity33 , could n't agree more : " when i worked for @entity33 , i cleaned the homepage to an international standard			1
" ahead of the upcoming @entity38 , i got the full download from @entity7 's e-commerce insiders for @entity0 's " on @entity7			1
" they tell me that in the mad , mad world of mainland e-commerce , the rules of the road from the @entity44 simply do n't apply			1
the superlative stats are well known : @entity7 has the world 's largest online population with over 591 million internet users			1
@entity7 is the world 's second - largest online retailing market , clocking in up to $ 210 billion in sales in 2012			1
@entity54 , @entity33 's consumer e-commerce engine , boasts sales bigger than @entity57 and @entity58 combined			2
the scale of @entity7 's e-commerce market is tantalizing			1
but it 's also a tough one to crack due in part to inadequate delivery services throughout the country			0
" the logistics industry is very fragmented in @entity7 , with the likes of @entity68 and @entity69 in @entity7 still unable to provide nationwide coverage and quality service , " @entity19 points out			2
as such , many @entity7 e-commerce companies including @entity21 provide their own last mile delivery to reach customers with a network of mopeds and motorcycles			1
another point of distinction is the extremely social nature of their customer base			0
" social media is a big one in @entity7 , " says @entity83 , senior vice president at @entity84			2
" fifty percent of consumers in @entity7 are leveraging social media to learn about new products			2
" " retailers need to engage in this social conversation and interact with @entity7 's tech - savvy consumers who are increasingly open to boosting e-commerce spending			1
" and that does n't just mean opening a branded @entity95 account			0
online chatting between customers and merchants is the norm with instant messaging embedded in almost every e-commerce platform			2
but do n't let all the friendly shop talk fool you			0
when @entity31 was at the helm of @entity33 , he led the offensive to undermine and defeat @entity57 in @entity7			2
" when @entity54 fought against @entity57 , we listed the top ten things @entity57 was doing in @entity7 -- and we did it 100 % differently , " he tells me			2
so while @entity57 charged for its listing fees , @entity54 offered no listing fee at all			0
while @entity57 used an auction model to rank its listings , @entity54 used a retail model to rank fresher listings at the top			0
and while @entity57 limited communication between merchants and customers , @entity54 created an instant messaging tool to encourage buyer - seller communication			0
@entity57 eventually shut its main website in @entity7			0
" the top ten things , the most important things @entity57 was doing , their winning elements , their winning recipe in the @entity127 , actually became the poison killing their business in @entity7 , " says @entity31			0
so if you 're a brand manager , investor , or entrepreneur eyeballing the market , observe with an open mind and proceed with caution			0
in @entity7 , e-commerce is a bloodsport .			1
