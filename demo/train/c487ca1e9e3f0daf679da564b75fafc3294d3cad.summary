-- gift - giving madness and the struggle to find the perfect present can consume the holiday season			2
but we 've got the travel buffs on your list covered with ideas from versatile backpacks to @entity11 chocolate that are sure to inspire wanderlust			1
exotic @entity13 ( $ 169 and up ; @entity14 ) this is about crossing borders of a different kind : @entity18 puts guests behind the wheel of one of its supercars -- ferraris to @entity24 to @entity25 -- at tracks in @entity27 , @entity28 ; @entity29 , @entity30 ; and @entity31 , among others			2
for driving enthusiasts , @entity18 is n't the only option			0
there are scenic locales across the @entity37 where you can plan a trip for a loved one in your own ride , including the 127 - mile @entity41 in @entity42 , the @entity43 through the @entity44 or going to the @entity45 in @entity46 , which cuts through @entity47			1
@entity49 's @entity48 ( $ 58 ; madecasse.com ) chocolate manufacturer @entity49 harvests its cocoa beans from @entity53 -- and makes its chocolate there , too			1
it bundles several of these flavors into gift baskets , ready for sampling			0
your best bet is the @entity48 , which is a sampler of each of @entity49 's flavors , in nine bars			1
if a taste of the chocolate gets you going , follow it back to the source : @entity53 has an array of national parks and islands for exploring			1
not to mention its @entity72 , running between @entity73 and @entity74 , which is lined with the country 's native tree			1
lucky bamboo ( prices vary			0
) for luck and fortune -- hopefully a big heap of travel money -- consider giving your globetrotter lucky bamboo			0
it 's often sold in pre-arranged designs : its stalks and leaves are flexible enough for sculpting			1
( there are heart and spiral arrangements , among many others			0
) plant care is minimal , requiring only water and indirect sunlight , so you can leave on vacation without killing it off			0
lucky bamboo is n't related to actual bamboo , though the two look alike			0
to see the real thing in its natural habitat , head to the bamboo groves in @entity106 , @entity107 , outside @entity108			0
paths crisscross the area , wide enough for walking or biking			0
@entity114 earmuffs ( prices vary ; chanel.com ) @entity114 's latest seasonal collection includes furry earmuffs : one pair is made from raccoon and orylag , another of tweed and rabbit and fox fur			1
let their cozy luxury be an inspiration : many @entity37 national forests are recreational centers for skiing , hiking and snowmobiling fans in the winter months			1
meanwhile , far north , midwinter brings twilight to the @entity135 -- as well as the spectacle of the northern lights			0
dror for @entity140 backpack ( $ 595 ; tumi.com ) the @entity138 for @entity140 line , a collaboration between the manufacturer and designer - architect @entity144 , emphasizes usability as well as luxury			1
the collection has drawn the attention of luggage aficionados for its functional pieces -- and the @entity138 for @entity140 backpack is no different , thanks to the bag 's expandability and streamlined design , which allows it to double ( and triple ) as a tote and briefcase			1
such versatility should be put to good use			2
@entity140 , so the story goes , was a name inspired from the days its founder spent in @entity166			1
the @entity168 : cat 's meow ( $ 179 - $ 209 ; thenorthface.com ) the @entity168 's @entity172 sleeping bag -- well - regarded for its durability and designed for three - season backpackers -- will help set up that camping or backpacking enthusiast for adventures in the wild			2
since it 's not suited to extreme cold , try camping this time of year in @entity181 's spectacular @entity180 , where average overnight temperatures are usually still mild			2
@entity183 ( prices vary ; silvacompass.com ) in an age of mobile gps , compasses can seem like an affectation -- except when traveling where a mobile phone or car ca n't go			0
that 's where something like the small , sturdy design of a @entity195 comes in handy : the colder months bring their own set of challenges when hiking or exploring on foot , but they can bring rewards as well			2
after the holiday , spend the next few months prepping to hike the @entity203 in @entity204 , at its southern end , just as spring approaches in early march			0
there will still be a chill in the air as you , and your compass , point north .			0

@entity49 's @entity53 chocolate is just the first taste of the country 's beauty
@entity140 's @entity138 line provides style and versatility
*sporting* @entity114 's earmuffs , explore one a @entity37 national forest
