-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 on friday signed the state 's immigration bill into law			1
it is considered to be among the toughest legislation in the nation			1
what does the @entity2 law do ? @entity2 's law orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there 's reason to suspect they 're in the @entity19 illegally			1
it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant laborers or knowingly transport them			0
are other states considering similar legislation ? @entity24 , general counsel for the @entity25 , helped draft the language of the @entity2 bill			1
@entity24 said lawmakers from four other states have approached him asking for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live			1
he declined to identify which states , citing attorney - client privilege			1
state laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years , according to the @entity37			1
in 2005 , 300 bills were introduced			0
the next year , that number nearly doubled , and in 2007 , more than 1,500 bills were introduced			0
another 1,305 were introduced in 2008 , and about 1,500 were considered in 2009			0
about 15 percent of those were enacted , dealing with issues such as driver 's licenses , health and education			2
about 1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year			0
what do opponents say ? critics , including immigrant advocates and the @entity52 of @entity2 , say they are concerned the law will foster racial profiling , arguing that most police officers do n't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person 's legal status			1
read remarks made friday by president , @entity2 governor is federal immigration legislation coming ? @entity64 tell @entity0 that if they do n't get @entity66 commitments soon , they likely will push to move a bill without @entity66 support			1
@entity64 sources said the chances of passing immigration reform in that scenario this year are slim , but they want to make clear to key constituencies they are at least trying			2
president @entity75 is still pushing for a bill , though			2
sen. @entity77 of @entity78 is the only @entity66 senator on board , but he has told @entity64 they will lose his support unless they find another @entity66			0
@entity75 recently called sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , to try to get him on board , a @entity82 spokeswoman said			0
on thursday , sen. @entity85 , @entity86 , said in a statement that during tough economic conditions , @entity19 are " dubious " about immigration reform			2
he said the @entity90 and @entity91 should not immediately take up the issue -- but instead " take targeted steps to deal with the crisis at the border , increase the usage of the e-verify program , and enhance prosecutions of employers who knowingly hire illegal workers			0
" the last immigration reform efforts in @entity91 were in 2005 when sen. @entity103 , @entity2 , and the late sen. @entity104 , @entity82 's predecessor , introduced a bipartisan bill that aimed to implement guest - worker programs and ways for more illegal immigrants to become citizens			1
the @entity112 bill , however , never came up for a vote in the @entity114			2
other legislative efforts have failed to gain momentum			0
@entity0 's @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this report .			0
