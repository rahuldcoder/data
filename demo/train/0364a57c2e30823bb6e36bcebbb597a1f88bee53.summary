-- @entity2 's finance minister believes oil prices could rise as high as $ 160 a barrel thanks to sanctions over its nuclear program , a prediction that comes just as the chief of the @entity11 nuclear watchdog agency headed to @entity12 on sunday for high - level talks			1
" we must pay close attention when we speak of oil revenues and sanctions against oil sales , who are the winners and the losers of such sanctions ? " @entity22 told @entity0 's " @entity24 " in an interview that airs sunday			2
" indeed , it is difficult			0
but not just for @entity2			0
and we can all rest assured that there will be a considerable increase in international oil market prices			1
now , is this the best approach ? " the comments came as the @entity32 said in a carefully worded statement that its director - general , @entity34 , was headed to @entity2 for talks on what it described only as " issues of mutual interest with high @entity2 officials			2
" the trip raises speculation that @entity2 may be willing to grant @entity32 inspectors access to sites to determine whether it is developing nuclear weapons			2
the talks come at a critical time for @entity2 , whose economy has been crippled by sanctions imposed by the @entity11 , the @entity52 and the @entity53			2
eighty percent of @entity2 's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports , and an embargo by the @entity53 set to go into effect in july will further devastate its economy			1
but @entity22 said the embargo would also likely hurt the @entity53 , which is grappling with its own weakened economy			0
oil prices as a result of the sanctions , he said , " will go considerably higher than $ 100 per barrel			1
" even the @entity65 " says as a result of these sanctions , oil prices will perhaps reach and hover around $ 160 per barrel , " he said			1
@entity22 gave little indication to @entity67 that @entity2 would be willing to abandon its nuclear program , which @entity12 has consistently maintained is solely for the development of alternative energy			0
" there are conversations and dialogues taking place currently , but there can not be a hegemony and a double - standard in the treatment of member countries such as @entity2 , " he said			0
" if these principles can be understood and applied with mutual respect , i think we will be in a much better place			0
if we do n't , we will witness a increase in international oil markets			0
" the @entity2 met with the @entity32 for the first time in three months in @entity87 , @entity88 , last week and are expected to meet again monday			0
later this week in @entity89 , @entity2 is set to continue talks over its nuclear program with world powers who make up the group known as @entity94 : the @entity52 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
tensions over the country 's nuclear program have roiled the @entity103 , with @entity2 threatening earlier this year to close the @entity104 , a vital oil shipping lane , if sanctions were imposed on its exports of crude oil			1
meanwhile , @entity109 has said it may attack @entity2 to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons			0
during the height of tensions , oil prices soared to $ 110 a barrel			1
the price per barrel of crude oil finished last week at $ 92.50 per barrel			0
in march , the @entity32 noted what it called a sharp and troubling increase in @entity2 's uranium enrichment capabilities			1
the @entity52 and its allies suspect that @entity2 is evading international inspections and is developing nuclear weapons			0
as punishment , @entity123 nations have slapped crippling sanctions on @entity2			0
leaders of the so - called @entity127 -- @entity52 , @entity128 , the @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity95 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity96 -- called on @entity2 on saturday to comply with the requirements of the @entity11 's watchdog agency to open its doors to nuclear inspectors			1
in a declaration , the @entity127 leaders said they welcomed the resumption of talks			2
the leaders called on @entity2 to engage " in detailed discussion about near - term , concrete steps that can , through a step - by - step approach based on reciprocity , lead towards a comprehensive negotiated solution which restores international confidence that @entity2 's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " according to the declaration			1
the @entity127 leaders also urged @entity2 to comply with international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of religion .			1
