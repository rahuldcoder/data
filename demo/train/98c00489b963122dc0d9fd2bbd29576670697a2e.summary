editor 's note : @entity2 is an international correspondent who has spent years investigating @entity4 's hidden stories from @entity5 to @entity6 and @entity7			1
she has previously worked for @entity9 and @entity10			0
the one thing you 're never prepared for every time you come back to @entity7 is how beautiful it is			1
at night the fishermen row home across @entity18 singing in @entity19 , lanterns waving from the bows that arch across the top of their canoes			0
even when you wind up through the hills , driving past @entity27 army camps and watching for any signs that the militias are on the move , you still get distracted by the sugar cane sellers and the drooping red bell flowers growing wild by the roadside			2
it 's only when you look closer that you start to notice the abandoned huts and half burned sheds hidden among the trees			1
it 's kind of an analogy for the conflict itself			2
it seems to be hidden in plain sight from the eyes of the world			1
every time i tell people i 'm visiting the @entity27 , they tell me " how awful			0
" but they also sound puzzled			0
it 's almost like we 've been hearing about this for so long that we 've all kind of presumed that must mean that something is being done			2
the tragedy is that we have n't heard the half of it			0
read how women are raped as a weapon of war when the @entity63 released a report stating it believed that over the last year 15,000 women had been raped in the eastern region of @entity7 , the consensus in @entity68 , the capital of @entity69 , was that there were many thousands more			1
read about @entity7 's ' heartbreaking decade ' dr. @entity71 , the founder of the unit treating victims of sexual unit at @entity75 in @entity68 , said there are many more women in hard to reach areas who are going without treatment and help			1
@entity82 has set up mobile clinics to try to get to these women in remote communities but as long as the violence continues to block roads and isolate communities , there will be many more women here , just out of reach and beyond protection			2
@entity82 receives outside funding from non-governmental organizations and the @entity95 but it is fundamentally a @entity27 run initiative and that 's another thing about @entity7 that you are unprepared for ; in the midst of the most extreme horror and cruelty @entity27 are trying to help themselves and each other			1
trauma centers have been set up in both @entity104 by local communities and there are also local organizations working to reunite and rehabilitate abandoned children and child soldiers			0
read about the child soldiers finding new hope they have n't succeeded in bringing peace but they 're taking steps towards healing			0
as one local activist said : " we are tired of talking , tired of waiting for the world to come			1
we have to act or we as a people will cease to exist			0

signs of @entity7 's violence are hidden among the country 's natural beauty
many fear @entity63 's *estimate* of 15,000 war rapes in a year is off by thousands
some are trying to bring help and hope to the *battered* country
one aid worker said : " we are tired of talking , tired of waiting for the world to come "
