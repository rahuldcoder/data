-- as @entity3 's apology tour continues , it becomes more and more disturbing to watch			1
with each heartfelt tearful statement , @entity3 seems completely uninterested in the broader contexts of her comments , missing ample opportunities to address the reality of racism today both in the form of cultural and social interactions , but even more powerfully by policies and actions			1
i heard her speak very little about the extraordinary injuries and injustices black people face , i have not heard her show alliance with those who fight racism nor show solidarity with or compassion for black people based on the profound impact racism has on their lives			1
what kind of heartfelt apology intended to prove you are not a racist ignores these gestures ? @entity3 is steadfast in her denials about being a racist			1
but she seems to explain away her actions or redirect the conversation when asked about the specifics of her comments and their implications			1
her reflections , apologies and justifications are striking in their inability to see things from the perspective of those she has offended , and how they might feel in the face of her actions			1
plus , she ca n't seem to connect her actions to broader , endemic conditions in society			1
this could be a teachable moment to discuss how complex racism is , how good intentions can not do the work of anti-racism education , and how even people who like black people can behave in ways that do racial harm			2
yes , @entity3 , good people can hold racist ideas even though they might not be aware of them			1
instead , it has turned in to a maudlin , self - absorbed reality - tv style drama			0
her apology on the " today " show on wednesday is a case in point			0
in it , @entity3 was asked about her use of the n - word			1
in reply , she emphasized that she had a gun put to her head and that the black man wielding it was someone to whom she had given a loan			0
her emphasis asks us to empathize with her			0
i guess we are to say , " oh sure , with a gun to my head i 'd resort to racial epithets , too , especially if i gave that n - word some loan money			0
" she has other options here : ones that might contribute to our broader racial conversation and knowledge about race			0
she could have said : " it was a horrible word to use given its powerful centuries long role , especially in the @entity97 , as a way to dehumanize black people			2
and , my identity as a white @entity97 woman ( one whose family were slave holders ) only makes it worse			0
it undermines my belief in racial equality and counters my efforts to support racial justice			0
" later in the interview , when " today " anchor @entity112 returned to the issue of her use of the n - word , she deflected her use , and instead described how the constant use of the word by the young black staffers in her kitchen hurts her			2
what ? i am not a fan of black youth using the word so casually , extensively and publicly , but there is a remarkable lack of self - awareness to imagine that their use of the term is equivalent to her use of the word			2
what does their use have to do with hers ? how is it that we are talking about her injury again ? her lack of awareness was evident again in her desire to have a plantation style wedding party , which would feature a black - only wait staff			1
she thought the black - only wait staff - who , in historical context would likely be performing as slave workers -- would be an entertaining theme			1
was she going to have the white guests perform @entity97 plantation era behavior of " cultured " and vicious racial domination , too ? who was supposed to be entertained by this ? perhaps some of the apology tour could be devoted to explaining her vision for this party and why she thought it a good idea			2
and , ideally , this would be followed by an admission that she should have considered the downside of having black low - wage workers , who as a group face extraordinary levels of job discrimination and other hurdles , play slaves for white partygoers			2
i suspect she imagines no ill racial intent in this , either			0
frankly , she is n't alone in this kind of thinking			0
our public understanding about how racism works today is thwarted by the personalized response that focuses on intention , rather than action			0
" good " people are very often blind to and support disturbing and discriminatory actions , behaviors and ideas			2
today , there is widespread normalized racial discrimination			0
one study shows that white job applicants with a criminal record are nearly twice as likely to get a call back for low - wage work than equally qualified black applicants with a college degree and no criminal record			0
for this apology tour to do real good , @entity3 might consider taking an anti-racist position , reaching out to black people and honoring the pain many face as a result of serious racial discrimination , and thinking about how she might have contributed to it			1
@entity3 might use her extensive media platform to draw attention to racial injustice today , to show the broader public just how much it saturates @entity216 society , even for those who think they are above it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			0
