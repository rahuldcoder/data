@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 massacre suspect @entity3 applied to join a gun range in june , but the range 's operator said sunday that he was disturbed by the " weird and bizarre " message on @entity3 ' answering machine			1
" it was weird , " said @entity9 , managing partner of the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity1			0
" i did n't know what kind of message was left by this idiot			0
we need to know if he 's an idiot before we let him have access to our range			1
" @entity9 told @entity2 that @entity3 sent in an online application on june 25			1
@entity9 said he called the number @entity3 left on the form , only to get a message he said was largely unintelligible			1
he said the voice was " guttural , freakish , maybe drunk			1
just weird and bizarre -- a deep , guttural , forced voice			0
" paying tribute to the victims @entity9 said @entity3 did n't call him back			1
he left another message , and said he was again disturbed by the voice on the machine			0
" it bothered me so much i told my staff , ' if this guy shows up , he gets nothing until i meet him , ' " @entity9 said			0
he said he tried calling @entity3 a third time , again with no response , then quit			1
@entity3 never called back , nor did he come to the range in @entity11 , about 40 miles east of @entity39			1
but when news broke friday of the bloodbath in a theater in the @entity39 suburb of @entity0 , @entity9 said one of his staffers remembered the name and saw that it matched reports of the suspect in the killings			0
@entity3 , a 24 - year - old doctoral student in neuroscience , was arrested outside the @entity53 multiplex early friday			1
he 's accused of opening fire in the crowded theater during a midnight screening of the new @entity58 movie , " @entity59			1
" shooting survivors recount @entity1 horror pictures obtained of @entity3 show a tall , bright - eyed , dark - haired young man , in contrast to the man a law enforcement official said had dyed his hair red and identified himself as " the @entity68 " after his arrest			2
and authorities recovered a @entity58 poster and mask from the apartment , a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation said sunday			1
it 's an image difficult to reconcile for those who know him as a clean - cut , quiet graduate student			2
he entered the @entity82 , in 2006 on a scholarship and graduated with highest honors with a bachelor 's degree in neuroscience in 2010			2
" academically , he was at the top of the top , " chancellor @entity87 said			0
@entity82 police have no record of any contact with @entity3 , the university said			2
neither did police at the @entity97 , where @entity3 enrolled in 2011 as a doctoral candidate in its neuroscience program at the @entity101 in @entity0 , university officials said in a statement released sunday			1
@entity3 ' sole brush with the law in @entity1 appears to have been a 2011 summons for speeding from @entity0 police			2
@entity3 attended @entity1 with the aid of a grant from the @entity110 , which allowed the university to pay him a $ 26,000 - a - year stipend for living expenses , university spokeswoman @entity107 said			2

he withdrew from the program in june 2012 , though " he gave no reason for his withdrawal from the graduate school , " said @entity107 , spokeswoman for the @entity97			0
it is not immediately clear if @entity3 , who also worked in a paid position in the university 's neuroscience research program , was still employed there after withdrawing from the program			1
he received a large volume of deliveries over the past four months to both his home and work addresses , which police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the rampage and the subsequent discovery of his booby - trapped apartment , @entity0 police chief @entity152 told reporters saturday			0

unlike most people his age , @entity3 does not appear to have a social media footprint -- no accounts with @entity186 , @entity187 or @entity188 , though authorities are investigating whether he posted a profile on the sex website @entity191			2
the profile contains a picture of a man with fiery red hair , a law enforcement source said			0
police believe it may be a picture of @entity3 , said the source , who was not authorized to speak to the media			1
the profile said it was created by a 24 - year - old man from @entity0 and has since been taken down			0
@entity191 said sunday that it " values the privacy of its members " and would not confirm the identity of any users			0
the site will respond to police inquiries " as may be required by law , " company spokesman @entity208 said in a written statement			0
it 's a profile that contrasts with news that @entity3 worked as a counselor at a summer camp for needy children in 2008			1
camp @entity218 caters to needy children ages 7 - 14 , and is run by @entity222 @entity221 of @entity223 , which confirmed his employment but would not offer further details or comment			0

@entity263 , a 20 - year - old grad student and neighbor , said she heard techno music blasting from his apartment around the time of the shooting and had nearly opened @entity3 ' unlocked apartment door to complain -- unaware that the unit was wired to explode			1
