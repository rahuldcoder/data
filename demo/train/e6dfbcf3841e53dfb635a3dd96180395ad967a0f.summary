-- they 're hardly a global soccer powerhouse , but @entity4 's @entity3 run has president @entity5 tweeting pictures of himself watching a game in a t - shirt			1
if the @entity4 can beat @entity10 convincingly on wednesday , they might make it to the knockout stage of the @entity3 for the first time ever			1
that 's one of five things we 'll be watching for and talking about wednesday : 1			1
@entity18 @entity17 trying to get through : a ) @entity10 vs. @entity4 if @entity4 can beat @entity10 by more than one goal , and @entity20 loses to @entity21 , @entity4 goes through to the knockout stage as the second - ranking team in @entity18 the @entity24 have a good record against @entity10			1
they 've won four , tied one , and never lost			0
they 've also put on an impressive display in @entity30 this year			0
they have n't managed to win a match yet , but they held @entity20 to a 0 - 0 draw and kept @entity21 from scoring for 90 minutes			1
only a magically curving goal from @entity36 in injury time denied the @entity4 a draw for the history books			1
b ) @entity21 vs. @entity20 sitting at the top of the group , @entity21 is guaranteed a place in the round of 16 , while @entity20 will be battling to hang onto second place			0
if the @entity46 win , they go top of the group			0
if they pull off a draw , they get a point and hang onto second place			0
if they lose , they have to hope it 's close , and that @entity4 does n't score a big win over @entity10			1
@entity55 free for all : a ) @entity56 vs. @entity57 @entity56 is out of the running , but any of the other teams in @entity60 could go through to the knockout stage , or , theoretically , be knocked out			1
switzerlandwill be aiming for a big win to steal that second - place spot for themselves			0
the two sides played to a draw the only previous match they played against each other			2
b ) @entity70 vs. @entity71 @entity70 is the safest , with six points and a six - point goal difference			0
so it would take a tremendous victory by @entity71 to knock the @entity70 out of the top spot			0
but the @entity77 will be fighting hard , because they are struggling to hang onto their second place spot in the group			0
@entity70 beat @entity71 the only previous time they faced each other			2
@entity83 the fangs come out : @entity85 's @entity83 is without doubt one of the best football players in the world			2
he 's also the most controversial			1
twice banned from games for biting opponents in the @entity92 and @entity93 , no one thought he would be dumb enough to bite someone on the biggest football stage of all			2
but he might have done just that in @entity85 's decisive match against @entity99			1
he definitely went face - first into @entity100 , and the @entity102 defender quickly pulled his shirt off his shoulder , claiming he 'd been bitten			0
@entity83 said after the match that he " just collided with his shoulder			2
" world soccer 's governing body @entity107 is looking into the incident and could ban @entity83 for up to two years			2
the internet went nuts over the incident , with people comparing @entity83 to @entity113 and @entity114 -- and worse			0
@entity115 @entity116 -- but whose ? with three former @entity3 champions , @entity118 was always sure to be the @entity116 , but the victims were hardly the ones anyone expected			0
@entity122 was the only team in the group that has never won the tournament , but far from being sacrificial lambs , they turned out to be giant - killers , beating @entity99 and @entity85			1
tuesday they finished their unbeaten run by holding hapless @entity93 to a 0 - 0 draw			0
and that was the end of @entity93 's @entity3 run			2
@entity135 v germany bring it : @entity137 is looking ahead to a make - or - break duel against @entity139 on thursday , hoping to go through to the knockout stage with a win or a draw			1
if they lose , @entity143 ( or , less likely , @entity144 ) could sneak into second place in @entity147 the trash talk has already begun at the very highest levels : @entity135 ambassador to the @entity152 @entity151 is ready to put a bet down on the game with her @entity156 counterpart			1
at stake - beer ! .			0
