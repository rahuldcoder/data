editor 's note : @entity2 explores innovative approaches and opportunities available in business and society through technology			0
( @entity8 ) -- the design studio @entity9 has created a novel process that allows a @entity12 printed dress to move and sway like real fabric			1
the bespoke software behind it , called @entity16 , combines origami techniques with novel approaches to @entity12 printing , pushing the technology 's limits			1
instead of pinning fabric to a dress form , a @entity16 garment starts as a 3 - d model in a cad program			1
kinematics breaks the model down into tessellated , triangular segments of varying sizes			0
designers can control the size , placement , and quantity of the triangles in a @entity36 - based design tool and preview how the changes will impact the polygonal pinafore			1
once the designer is satisfied , algorithms add hinges to the triangles uniting the garment into a single piece and compress the design into the smallest possible shape to optimise the printing process , often reducing the volume by 85 percent			1
after two days of printing at @entity50 , a dusty boulder of plastic emerges from an industrial - sized 3 - d printer			1
technicians remove excess dust like archeologists in search of a long - buried garment			0
the plastic parts are cleaned and dyed , resulting in a little black ( or white ) dress made from tiny , interlocking bricks of plastic			1
no gimmicks for this gown designer @entity65 made sure the gown was more than mere gimmickry			0
buttons , cleverly modelled into the triangles make it easy to don and doff			0
unlike other @entity12 printed clothing that feels like a suit of armour , the long dress flows and moves as the model strides and twirls			1
what cities would look like if @entity79 only by the @entity80 comfort was a key concern			0
@entity65 wore @entity12 printed jewellery for weeks at a time in an attempt to catch design features that chafe			1
she built her wardrobe piece by piece , starting with a bracelet , then a belt , and finally a bodice before moving on to a dress			1
@entity65 brought an old - school tailor 's approach to the project , but was happy to leverage modern technology			1
for example , @entity12 scans of the model 's body ensured a perfect fit			0
she worked with @entity50 to optimise the print quality and aesthetics			0
as a result , her garment and its @entity105 repository recently were acquired by the @entity107 making it work nervous system originally developed the @entity16 concept as part of a project for @entity113			1
the goal was to help add bit of cool to a pavilion promoting @entity119 phones			0
nervous system figured out how to print bracelets on @entity122 by reducing dimensional designs to flat pieces of plastic that could be printed in under an hour and folded like origami			1
@entity113 was pleased with the promotion , but @entity9 believed the concept could be used to make garments			1
" we 'd done some simulations and made some animations showing that we could do it hypothetically , " says @entity65			0
these hypothetical simulations precipitated a software engineering effort one year in the making			1
scaling up from a wrist - worn wearables to cocktail dress posed a particular challenge			1
the hinges linking the triangles must be small enough to let the fabric flow , but robust enough to avoid a wardrobe malfunction			1
these mechanical challenges were exacerbated by limitations in @entity12 printing technology			2
pieces made with the technology have a grain , like wood , and certain orientations create stronger parts			0
the solution was to revamp the software			2
" we were able to do so much design-wise without ever printing anything , " says @entity65			2
" we knew not only exactly what the final piece would look like but also how it would behave			0
" simulating folds was slow and inaccurate at first			0
test prints of belts with 77 hinges worked beautifully , but scaling up to the 700 or more needed to create a dress repeatedly broke the software			1
physics engines were tossed aside like fabric swatches			2
15 incredible photos that 'll remind you to be awed by @entity170 originally , the simulator would fold the clothes down into a ball			2
" sort of like you are wadding clothes up to toss in you hamper , " says @entity65			0
" it looked cool but it was n't the most efficient way to get the volume of our designs down			2
" so @entity65 and partner @entity182 developed a collision - based simulator that replicates how one might fold clothes to put them in a drawer			2
the project pushed design , fashion , and fabrication in surprising ways			1
" to @entity12 print structures in this crazy compressed form and have them unfold ; that almost sounds like science fiction , " says @entity65			0
" frankly , when you work on something complex like this in a completely digital world for so long , the biggest surprise is that it actually works as intended , from the compressing to the fit , draping , and movement			0
" printing also required special development			2
@entity9 needed to develop new tools to load its software			2
" we 've been working with @entity9 and our community over the years to push the machines to their limits , " says @entity205 of @entity50			0
" from how densely we can pack the trays so you can print 1,000 products at once versus just one , to how long you need to run them so we can produce products more quickly , to how precise and detailed the prints can be so that you can design with micron precision			2
" ready to wear ? next up for nervous system is improving the speed and adding new mechanisms and structures that will allow simulating different materials -- think of a stout tweed versus a gossamer silk			2
ultimately , the team thinks can be expanded for other applications like @entity228 project			0
at $ 3,000 a pop , @entity9 is n't quite ready to commercialise its wearable wares			1
" that is a very high number although perhaps considerably lower than the price of most other @entity12 printed garments , " she says			0
" we 're hoping to bring the price down before we start selling clothing			0

a design studio has created a @entity255 printed dress that sways like real fabric
the software behind the process combines origami techniques with *3d* printing
the company originally developed the concept as part of a @entity113 project
at $ 3,000 a pop , it is n't quite ready for the *retail* market yet
