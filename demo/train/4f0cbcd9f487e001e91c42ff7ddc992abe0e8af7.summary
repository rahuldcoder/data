however , the final @entity15 report has not been completed			0

another @entity15 civil rights investigation into the @entity43 's overall track record with minorities is ongoing			1
@entity45 , an attorney for @entity5 's family , declined to comment on the news wednesday			1
" the family of @entity50 will wait for official word from the @entity15 regarding whether or not any charges will be filed against the police officer who shot and killed him , " @entity45 said in a written statement released wednesday			1
" the family wo n't address speculation from anonymous sources			1

" you have to show an intentional deprivation of a civil right			2
" given how difficult it is to prove intent , and also how many conflicting accounts emerged from the grand jury investigation , " it would be very difficult to move forward federally with a civil rights charge , " @entity65 said			1
if no federal charges are brought against @entity3 , who resigned from his position as a @entity12 police officer in november , some people in the area will be disappointed , said @entity83 , a @entity84 city alderman who lives near @entity12			1
" i think you have a lot of people who will be disappointed if this does turn out to be the case			0
the community and the family wanted a day in court , an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out , cross-examined , " @entity83 said			2
" and it looks like that 's not going to happen			0
i hope we do n't have any violence as a result of this			2

but we want to keep them peaceful , nonviolent , " he said			0
" because violence makes the situation worse			0
it divides the community in a time we need to come together and make everyone feel like they can get equal protection			0
" ultimately , he said , some of the protesters ' goals can be achieved outside the courts			0
" the next steps i think are legislative change , " @entity83 said , " trying to make sure that in cases like this we get a special prosecutor by law , and to create a new level of civilian oversight over police departments			0
" in his state of the state speech on wednesday , @entity13 gov. @entity136 said addressing " the broader , systemic issues " raised by the unrest that followed the killing of @entity5 would demand " sustained effort			2
