the @entity0 will undertake a major examination of privacy in the digital age , after accepting review friday of a pair of appeals over whether police must obtain a warrant to search data on the cellphone of a person under arrest			1
criminal suspects in @entity14 and @entity15 were convicted , in part , after phone numbers , text messages , and addresses obtained from personal electronic devices linked them to criminal drug and gang activity			1
oral arguments could be held as early as april , with a potential far - reaching ruling by june			1
the appeals are separate from president @entity27 's review of @entity29 surveillance of metadata phone records			1
the individual search cases give the justices a timely opportunity to reenter the public debate over the limits of privacy in the digital age , with focus on the ubiquitous cellphone and its vast storage of information and video			1
that has left judges nationwide divided recently over how to apply a 40 - year - old high - court precedent , which allows searches of items a suspect possesses following arrest			2
should law enforcement have such easy warrantless access to possibly incriminating , even embarrassing , digital evidence , or should exceptions be created ? @entity54 was arrested in 2009 for an expired registration on his vehicle			2
when authorities impounded the vehicle , loaded weapons were found hidden under the hood			2
after his arrest , @entity62 police took a look at his smartphone			0
text messages and contacts in the device led officers to believe @entity54 had organized crime connections , and video of another vehicle owned by the suspect was linked to an earlier drive - by shooting			0
he was convicted in state court and received a 15 - year jail sentence			0
separately , @entity78 was arrested in 2007 for selling two packets of crack cocaine			0
he had an old - style flip phone in his pocket , and police in @entity84 used call logs on the device to trace his real home address , after he gave a bogus one			0
there officers with a search warrant found more drugs , a weapon , and ammunition			1
he was later convicted in federal court			0
in neither case was a warrant sought by police before the phones were initially searched			1
but one appeals court upheld @entity54 's conviction , while another tossed out @entity78 's			2
that split was likely the impetus for the @entity0 to step in now and try to clarify search guidelines in these and future cases			1
the @entity108 's @entity107 protects against " unreasonable searches and seizures			0
" but the high court has repeatedly affirmed the government 's discretion to conduct warrantless initial patdowns and searches of persons and vehicles -- to ensure officers ' safety and prevent destruction of evidence			0
but privacy advocates and defense attorneys argue portable , easily storable technology makes these appeals different			2
" modern cell phones provide ready access to a vast array of personal data , and are distinct from the types of possessions , such as cigarette packages and footlockers , this [ high ] court has previously considered , " said @entity126 , a @entity128 law professor , and @entity54 's attorney			1
" thus , a search incident to arrest could , at the touch of a button , become a search of private and confidential information such as medical records , banking activity , and work - related e-mails , " @entity126 said			2
but @entity15 officials say for constitutional purposes , a cellphone is no different than a wallet when it comes to initial searches of criminal suspects			1
" a custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the @entity107 ; that intrusion being lawful , a search incident to arrest requires no additional justification , " said @entity154 , @entity15 attorney general			1
at least 85 - percent of @entity162 own cellphones , according to recent surveys , many of the more sophisticated variety such as smartphones , that allow mass storage of personal information that can be easily shared			0
not lost on the larger national debate over government searches was the fact the justices accepted these two petitions the same day @entity27 justified the electronic surveillance efforts by the @entity29			0
@entity27 announced changes to the way intelligence agencies will gather raw telephone records -- so - called meta data of numbers and times of phone calls by nearly every @entity162			0
but he defended the need for continued intelligence - gathering efforts of domestic and foreign communications , to stop potential terror plots			0
the current cases are u-s v. @entity78 ( 13 - 212 ) and @entity54 v. @entity15 ( 13 - 132 ) .			1
