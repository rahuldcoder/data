-- how do you dispose of @entity3 's chemical weapons stockpiles ? call in private industry			1
the @entity5 announced friday it has invited chemical disposal firms to let the group know if they 're interested , but added that it 's working on a tight schedule			2
the request for " expressions of interest " comes a week after the organization 's executive council asked its director - general to explore " options for destruction in chemical disposal facilities " of chemicals that @entity3 has declared			1
the document lists 19 chemicals			0
most of @entity3 's declared chemical weapons program includes common industrial chemicals or otherwise chemicals that can safely be rendered harmless or destroyed , the @entity5 said			1
an estimated 1.8 million pounds ( 800 metric tons ) , accounting for a major part of @entity3 's stockpile , is to be disposed of commercially at a cost estimated at $ 47 million to $ 54 million , it added			1
the companies will also destroy the effluent resulting from the " effective destruction " of higher - priority chemicals			1
the closing date for receipt of an expression of interest is november 29			0
a joint @entity5 - @entity37 team charged with overseeing the destruction of the weapons began inspecting sites in october			2
the @entity42 resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid- 2014 for @entity3 to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences			1
the @entity5 said it expected that " the most critical chemicals " would be removed from @entity3 by the end of 2013			1
the @entity37 resolution on @entity3 's chemical weapons was based on a deal struck between the @entity52 and @entity53 that averted an @entity52 military strike over allegations the @entity3 government used sarin nerve gas in an august 21 attack on a @entity60 suburb			1
@entity52 officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack			0
@entity3 denied responsibility , blaming rebel forces			2
in an update last friday , the @entity5 said it had verified that more than 60 % of @entity3 's declared unfilled munitions had been destroyed			2
@entity3 has committed to destroy all unfilled warheads and bombs by january 31			1
it follows its announcement on october 31 that @entity3 had destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing , filling and production facilities and that all of the chemical weapons at inspected sites were under seal			1
opposition factions unite the movement on the chemical weapons front came as six opposition fighting factions announced friday the formation of a new alliance : the @entity81			1
" this blessed front has been formed with the will of @entity88 to fulfill our countrymen 's ambitions in @entity3 and in accordance with their aspirations and to pave the way for the gradual unification of factions and founding movements , " @entity82 , an official of the group , said in a video statement on @entity85			1
the alliance includes tens of thousands of fighters from some of @entity3 's most powerful @entity102 groups , including @entity103 , @entity104 , the @entity105 and the @entity106			2
the groups control territory in key areas across @entity3 and have been fighting forces loyal to president @entity111 along the critical lines of @entity60 and @entity113 , among others			0
" the @entity81 will be militarily , politically , and socially independent and its aim will be the complete fall of the @entity111 regime and the creation of a sovereign @entity105 state , " @entity115 , a spokesman for the @entity106 , the largest rebel faction in @entity113 , said in an online statement			0
the announcement diminishes the stature of the @entity125 - backed @entity124 and its leadership abroad , the @entity127 , as leaders inside the country seek to distance themselves from a command structure criticized for failing to serve the opposition 's needs on the ground			0
" this will change and it will increase our numbers and unify our ideology , " said capt. @entity134 , a spokesman for the @entity105 , an alliance member , in an interview with @entity0			0

" the moves come after the @entity145 - linked @entity144 succeeded as the predominant military force in northern @entity3 , marginalizing and even fighting @entity3 's more moderate factions			2

the @entity3 conflict began in march 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the @entity159 movement and is now a full - blown civil war			0
