-- @entity2 president @entity1 has warned @entity3 that targeted sanctions are " ready to go , " as the @entity6 agreement to de-escalate the crisis falters			1
officials have vowed more punitive international actions targeting @entity3 's economy if @entity12 , in their view , continues to aggravate the situation			0
@entity15 allies , high - profile @entity3 oligarchs and possibly @entity3 institutions and companies , will be targeted , @entity0 has been told			2
@entity1 , at a news conference friday in @entity21 , said he would be talking to other @entity23 leaders about sanctions against @entity3 as the @entity26 crisis worsens			1
the @entity27 has already introduced sanctions , imposing financial and visa restrictions on around 30 @entity3 and @entity26 officials -- but stopping short of measures that would hit trade			1
however , the uncertainty has fed capital flight , prompting @entity35 's to cut @entity3 's credit rating to one notch above junk			0
hours later @entity3 raised its interest rates to limit the damage			0
@entity26 hiked its bank rates on april in an attempts to protect its economy against the turmoil triggered by violent protests and @entity3 's military intervention in @entity47			2
@entity3 is deeply integrated in the global economy , and links with the @entity50 are particularly strong			1
here 's the background to @entity3 's relationship with the @entity27			2
how important is @entity3 's economy ? @entity3 is the eight biggest economy in the world , with gdp of more than $ 2 trillion			2
its economy -- which is heavily reliant on commodities , particularly oil and gas -- is expected to grow only slightly in 2014 to around $ 2.4 trillion			0
hopes it would be one of the decade 's powerhouse economies have faded , with its gdp growing just 1.3 % last year compared to 2012 , one of the sharpest slowdowns in the emerging markets			0
@entity3 boomed in the late 1990s and early 2000s as energy prices rose , then stumbled as demand for commodities contracted			0
but its energy supplies remain vitally important for the @entity50 , to which it supplies a third of its natural gas			1
@entity76 , the eurozone 's biggest economy , imports around 40 % of its gas from @entity3			0
with the @entity26 crisis taking its toll , @entity3 's economy may not grow at all in 2014 , some analysts have warned			1
what is @entity3 's economic relationship with the @entity2 ? the economic relationship between @entity3 and the @entity2 is unbalanced			1
@entity3 is the 20th largest trading partner for the @entity2 , with $ 27 billion worth of trade exported across the @entity88			1
on the flip - side , the @entity2 is @entity3 's fifth largest partner , with just $ 11 billion worth of trade			1
according to @entity3 foundation chair @entity91 , trade is a " relatively unimportant " component of relations			0
energy links are also weakening as the @entity2 looks to shale gas for its energy supplies and heads towards self - sufficiency			1
however , in march the @entity98 took its first step on sanctions , imposing a visa ban on @entity3 and @entity26 officials and individuals " responsible for , or complicit in threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of @entity26			1
" an expansion of the sanctions has been threatened			0
what is @entity3 's economic relationship with the @entity50 ? the @entity50 is @entity3 's largest trading partner , and there are deep economic links between the two			1
almost half of @entity3 's exports -- $ 292 billion worth -- end up in @entity50 countries			2
@entity3 , in turn , is the third biggest trading partner for the @entity50 , with $ 169 billion in imports			2
the @entity50 initially stepped more cautiously than the @entity2 on sanctions			2
however , earlier this month , the @entity50 said it would reinforce sanctions and target an additional four people in its sanctions			0
this will bring the total number of people subject to @entity50 asset freezes to 22			0
members of the @entity128 have also said they will not attend a planned summit in @entity130 this june , instead meeting in @entity131 without @entity3			0
meanwhile , the @entity27 has offered $ 16 billion in aid for @entity26 , helping the country prop up its ailing finances			2
the @entity135 has also said @entity26 has $ 14 billion to $ 18 billion credit available if required			0
why did the @entity2 and @entity50 approach @entity3 differently ? the eurozone has only just emerged from its own crisis , and commentators say it could be wary of rapidly cutting ties with such a powerful economic partner			1
its reliance on gas out of @entity3 would also feed caution			0
in contrast , the @entity2 is weaning itself off @entity3 's energy supplies and its trade relationship is much less intertwined			1
map : how @entity26 is divided @entity150 's @entity149 contributed to this report			0

@entity3 risks being *isolated* by the @entity27 as it introduces visa bans and threatens more sanctions
but the @entity50 is reliant on @entity3 for its energy supplies , and has strong trade links
trade is not so important between @entity3 and @entity2 , which is becoming energy self - sufficient
these differences have *impacted* the economic approaches to @entity3 amid the crisis in @entity26
