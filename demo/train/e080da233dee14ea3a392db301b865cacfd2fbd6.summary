-- in the white sand beaches of @entity2 , the small fishing town just north of the @entity5 capital @entity6 , a seemingly endless line of brightly colored boats dots the @entity10 seaside			1
it was here , about four years ago , that @entity14 designer @entity13 was first struck by the mysterious symbols and intricate patterns adorning the hand - painted wooden vessels			2
" i was amazed by the beauty of the fishing boats , many of which were old , damaged by the salt and the sun or abandoned , " remembers @entity13 , who was at the time cycling solo around the @entity20 country			1
" i was captivated by that colorful mosaic of life with the women selling the fish and the men approaching the shore , " he adds			2

his idea was to work with skillful local craftsmen and breathe new life into the traditional " pirogues " by transforming them into hand - made furniture			2
and that 's how @entity58 was born , a company repurposing boats that are no longer sea worthy into upcycled fittings -- anything from whimsical chairs and coffee tables to one - of - a - kind cabinets and even foosball tables			1
" it 's like a reincarnation of something that had life before -- a life in the @entity10 , a life in @entity65 , " says @entity13			1
" every time you see this furniture , you have a piece of the soul and the history of these fishermen , " adds the 52 - year - old designer			0
long journey from the waters off the coast of @entity5 , through the @entity6 - based workshop , to several stores across the world , the journey of transforming the old fishing boats into furniture is far from easy			1
@entity58 employs 12 craftsmen , including a co-ordinator who is in regular contact with the local fishermen about the purchase of those boats whose life span on the ocean waters has ended -- usually after 40 to 50 years of use			1

once that 's completed , they decide how to reconstruct the old samba wood -- depending on its size , condition and color combinations -- without any wood treatment or additional painting			0
@entity58 's eclectic creations are then shipped to @entity111 , @entity13 's base , and from there they are sent to clients across @entity115 , as well as stores in @entity117 and @entity118			1
passion for @entity65 @entity13 says that what makes the furniture special is the history behind it and the creativity of the artisans working with raw materials that are hard to remodel			0
" the main reason of this project is to preserve the wood as it was , with all the stories , all the nautical miles sailed in @entity10 , " says @entity13			2
read this : bamboo bikes put business on right track " this wood ... has certain limitations , not only because it has a shape but also because it 's very damaged by the salt , the sea , the sun and the time			0
but these artisans are very talented , " he adds			0
" their creativity is not academic , they are like this by nature because ( for them ) recycling and reusing is not a fashion , it 's not a trend			0
" looking ahead , @entity13 says his goal is to expand the business and help other skilled craftsmen to develop their creative talents			0
" @entity65 for me is a social inspiration , it 's my passion , " he says			0
" we started with the fishing boats ... because i was astonished when i saw the beaches with these stylish boats but maybe this is just the beginning , " adds @entity13			1
" there is a lot of creativity that we can use and we can take from @entity20 artists -- i want to continue to collaborate and discover the @entity20 talent , this is my aim			0
