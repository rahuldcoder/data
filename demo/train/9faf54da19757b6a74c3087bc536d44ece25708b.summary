-- crossing the road can be dangerous -- even if you 're the largest land animal on the planet			0
thousands of elephants roam @entity5 in northern @entity6 , a wildlife haven that 's home to one of the highest elephant concentrations in @entity9			1
right next to the vast park lies @entity11 , a small town situated on the banks of the @entity14			0
here , humans live side by side with large herds of migrating elephants that wander through the area in search of food and fresh water -- and this has created a lot of tension			0
" the conflict here is about space , " says @entity27 , a phd candidate monitoring the movement of animals in @entity11 as part of her work with conservation group @entity33			0
" that 's what it comes down to , " she adds			0
" allowing wildlife to have space to move through			0
" @entity43 's research is looking at the functionality of small - scale wildlife corridors within urban communities , examining whether they can be an effective way to avoid human - wildlife conflict before it happens			1
using motion detection cameras , the researcher is monitoring eight different corridors in the area , some of which are as small as five meters wide			1
one of the key points of the human - wildlife conflict in @entity11 is a two - lane highway that cuts through the corridors the elephants use as they make their way to the @entity14 river to drink and bathe			1
" all the corridors i 'm monitoring have to go past this road , " explains @entity43			0
" there are a high number of accidents each year , " she adds , " generally in the evening when visual acuity is poor , which coincides with the busiest time for wildlife utilization			0
" read this : rangers risk their lives to save elephants as part of her study , @entity43 is looking at the frequency of car usage and whether that correlates to how the herds of elephants are moving through the area			0
as it turns out , the majestic mammals are adapting to human behavior -- especially on weekends			0
" it 's amazing , " she says			0
" there 's a bar at each of the corridors they have to pass by			2
i was looking at the results and i could suddenly see there 's this big drop in wildlife coming through on friday and saturday nights			2
i thought what 's going on ? it 's so obvious ... animals are adapting to our habits -- and our drinking habits , " adds @entity43			0
" it 's amazing to think they know when it 's going to be lots of people and rowdy and very busy and they just do n't come at that time ; or they 'll come in later or come in when it 's quieter			0
" why corridors are important elephants without @entity116 was recently tasked with leading what 's being called the @entity118 , a pan-african aerial survey aimed at securing more accurate data on the continent 's elephant population			1
but while the group is known for its extensive , cross-border research , it believes that urban small - scale corridors , the effectiveness of which is examined now for the first time , could be just as important			1
" it 's such a basic concept , " explains @entity43			0
" just give wildlife the space to come in ; they will use and the conflict will be reduced			2
" read this : boy 's website helps tourists spot big beasts @entity140 , @entity33 program manager , says that in a human - dominated landscape , corridors provide safe passage for wildlife to access valuable resources like food and water			1
" if corridors are n't provided for or are blocked , then the wildlife will do what they must to get to those vital resources , as their survival depends on it -- even if it means having to forge through villages , homesteads and farms			2
and that creates human and wildlife conflict , in which both people and the wildlife suffer			1
" @entity33 says that currently if a passage is labeled a wildlife corridor it is designated on the town 's land management and development plans , indicating that the area can not be allocated for another use other than as an access route for wildlife			2
however , the group is pushing for more stringent terminology and adapted legal rules to be applied to these passages			0
the overall plan is to have designated wildlife corridors in legislation , so as towns grow there are set paths for elephants to use and ultimately lessen the impact of their growing numbers			1
" elephants are extremely intelligent and have the capability to learn how to adapt to changes within their environment , " says @entity140			1
" so , as a town becomes more and more developed , they will look for new routes allowing them access to what they need -- as long as there are those access routes			0
" returning to ancestral homelands with around 130,000 african elephants , @entity6 has the continent 's largest elephant population			1
it is seen as the last stronghold of the magnificent mammals in the continent ; while other countries rare facing declining populations , @entity6 must deal with rising elephant numbers and their impact on local communities and the environment			1

" elephants have become a victim of their own success			0
" can this environment sustain 130,000 elephants , eight elephants per square kilometer that are chewing up 250 kilos of vegetation per day ? " asks @entity214			2
" clearly not -- so we 've got to create safe passages and corridors so that these elephants can move out of @entity6 , release this bottleneck and repopulate areas such as southeast @entity231 and southwest @entity232 , where elephants occur at very low densities and can be a magnet for eco-tourism			1
" research has shown that the home ranges in northern @entity6 are the largest ever recorded for @entity9 elephants , which are free to roam across @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity231 and @entity232			1
the @entity33 's findings helped create the world 's largest wildlife preservation known as @entity245 , or @entity246			1
this is an international conservation region in southern @entity9 , spanning 440,000 square kilometers across five countries			2
the initiative is protecting some of the wildlife corridors and habitats identified by @entity33			1

" @entity246 is really the last hope for elephants , " he adds			0
" this romance of elephants moving from the coastal plains of @entity270 , through @entity271 , across the @entity272 to the foothills of @entity274 -- i yearn for that ; i see that in elephants and @entity246 provides for conservation at a scale at which these species evolved			2

@entity9 's largest elephant population can be found in @entity6
elephants without @entity116 is testing small - scale urban wildlife corridors
the goal is to see whether these passages can be used to avoid human - wildlife conflict
conservationists say elephants learn to adapt to changes in their environment
