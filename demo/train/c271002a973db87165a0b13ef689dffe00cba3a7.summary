@entity1 , @entity0 -- " @entity3 - ran ! " from out of the crowd lining the roadside , i hear a voice calling enthusiastically			1
it 's @entity10 and her 5 - month - old baby , waiting patiently in line for the latest distribution of relief supplies to arrive in @entity1			1
ten days ago , @entity10 was the first person i met in this town , huddled by candlelight with her family of eight in a school			1
they had been living in the third grade classroom with two other families since november 8 , when @entity23 ripped through the @entity24 of the @entity0 and destroyed their homes			1
unfailingly polite , always smiling , and ever courteous , she has become a symbol in my mind of the people of @entity1 and their grace under pressure			1
some unseen force has compelled me to pick up my camera and go for one last walkabout before leaving this place			1
over the next hour , as the sun sets on this storm - battered coastal town , i meet many of the characters who have narrated its story and provided me with a salient lesson in dignity and resilience			1
@entity10 is handed a token for the distribution by a man named @entity47			1
grizzled and tough , he is a local councilor and president of the @entity49			1
he 's also a criminologist by training and a fish processor by profession			1
the @entity0 is a quirky country			1
earlier in the week , @entity47 took us on a tour of @entity56 , a poor fishing neighborhood clinging to a nearby stretch of coastline			1
he introduced us to family after family who had lost their homes and their livelihoods to the storm			1
but , tellingly , there was one very important fact which he failed to mention that morning -- his own losses			1
as i chat with him , the sun setting on the sea behind us , he laughingly gestures to a broken fishing boat lying by the roadside			1
" that landed on my house , " he says			1
and there in front of us is the pile of concrete rubble which is all that remains of the @entity47 home			1
@entity47 , his wife and two daughters have been living under a tarpaulin and surviving on relief supplies			1
" my sister is rebuilding , so we can live with her for a while			1
she 's married to an @entity91 , so they can afford it			1
" @entity47 's fish - drying business has also been destroyed and , like so many other people here , he has no way to make a living			2
yet he shrugs and tells me life will go on			2
@entity102 is drifting along the seafront and flaming bonfires of debris are being fed by a group of local people under the watchful and mischievous eye of @entity109			2
" this is a community effort to get on with the cleanup , " he laughs			2
" we 're not waiting for the municipality to do it			2
" like so many men here , he is a former seaman and has traveled the world as a bosun on container ships			2
now he is the proud owner , along with his wife @entity119 , of the somewhat battered @entity121 hotel			2
on the day of the typhoon , they were forced to abandon the building when a 20 - foot storm surge smashed through the ground floor , destroying all before it			2
they have tidied up as best they can and are playing host to various foreign and @entity0 aid workers			1
" i think it will take the town six months to recover from this , " he muses , serious for a moment , " but we will recover			2
" across the road , another sign of recovery : in the dying light , a group of young men are boisterously indulging in the national sporting obsession -- basketball			2
they have cleared a space among the fallen trees , broken bamboo poles and general debris which has come to form so much of the landscape here			2
" @entity152 , " one of them calls in the ubiquitous greeting for white foreigners , which is a throwback to the @entity157 military presence here during @entity159 " come and join us			2
" despite the fact that i have six inches on most of them , i respectfully decline , knowing they would run rings around me			0
across the town , there is a reassuring buzz and bustle ; traders manning their stalls by candlelight , a preacher calling to the world through a battery - powered sound system , and light pouring from the local church			0
inside , a group of people gather to say the rosary and share each other 's company			0
this is a deeply religious country , predominantly catholic			0
father @entity184 is away in the city of @entity187 tonight			0
yesterday he told me he had secured funding from a religious order to help rebuild 10 fishing boats and was hoping to get funding for 10 more			0
his main mission though , is to find a way to rebuild the elementary school next door			0
" we will succeed , " he says , smiling			0
on the other side of the square , the hum of a generator comes from behind the municipal hall			0
inside , i find mayor @entity203 at his desk working on the local government response to the crisis			0
for the past three weeks , he and his team have been here day and night organizing , coordinating and administering			0
across from the mayor , @entity208 gives a weary wave and calls a greeting , " hello my friend ! is there anything you need ? " @entity208 is a farmer by profession , but has been working as a volunteer since @entity23 hit , organizing boatloads of supplies to the outlying islands			1
i wave back and turn away to hide my emotion , realizing that i 'm undoubtedly the least needy person in this town			0
and yet people who have lost everything have consistently offered me what little they have , be it coffee , spam or just a welcoming smile			0
and never , not once , has anybody ever asked me for anything			0
leaving the @entity230 , i bump into @entity231 , a native of @entity1 who has come back to help coordinate the civil society response			0
she is the one who brought us here			0
as she waves off a mini-bus loaded with volunteers from a church group in @entity187 , i ask her what it is that makes this place special			0
" you know , i was just thinking about this last night , " she answers			0
" i am amazed by the bond that exists between the people here , the sense of community			0
" she points to a sign which has appeared in the plaza which , roughly translated , reads " we love @entity1 and we will rebuild it			0
" as i head home , " @entity3 - ran " rings out through the darkness and i can just make out the form of @entity10 and some of her family gathered around an open fire			0
the kids pose and joke for the camera			0
their temporary classroom home has been reclaimed for lessons and they have been moved to a tent			0
