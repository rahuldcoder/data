-- congratulations , members of @entity3 : a new poll finds that you 're not viewed as having the lowest ethical standards of any profession in the country ! you edged out car salesman for that honor			1
of course , you 're viewed as the second worst profession in terms of honesty and ethics , but hey , savor this moment -- you 've earned it			1
at least these are the findings of a @entity20 poll released this week that asked people to rate " the honesty and ethical standards of people " in different professions			1
besides @entity3 and car salesmen , also bringing up the rear in this poll are the usual suspects , among them lawyers , stockbrokers and bankers			1
topping the list of professions we find most ethical were nurses , followed by pharmacists and doctors			2
dentists came in lower , but i doubt that dentists are truly less honorable than @entity42 ; it 's just that dentists seem to enjoy causing us so much pain that this may be our way of paying them back			0
in reviewing the poll results , i am left with a few burning questions			2
first , how can car salesmen be viewed as less trustworthy than @entity3 ? it was n't the guys at the local @entity55 or @entity56 dealership who caused our government to lose its aaa credit rating			1
and they are n't the ones who ca n't agree on a budget deal while we collectively stare into the abyss of the " fiscal cliff			0
" in fact , i have no doubt that a group of car salesmen could iron out a deal on the budget quicker than our recalcitrant @entity3 -- plus get us all to buy some undercoating for our cars to boot			1
but here are my bigger questions about this poll			2
do we really care about the ethics of the people in these professions ? does it truly matter to us whether they are honest ? if we actually did care about the moral fitness of @entity3 , why would we re-elect them to the tune of 91 % in 2012 ? if honesty truly meant something to us , would n't we have voted out at least half of them ? even 25 % ? but no , when given a chance last month to vote out @entity3 , we sent home only 9 % of those up for re-election			1
and let 's look at lawyers , a profession consistently viewed as ethically challenged			2
before i saw the light and became a comedian , i was a practicing attorney for about six years			0
i can tell you firsthand that my clients never , ever asked me about ethics			0
what did my clients always ask me about ? how do we win -- be it a lawsuit or negotiations			0
( followed by : how much is this going to cost me ? ) i even had clients tell me , in essence : i do n't care what you have to do to win this case ; win it , or i will find a lawyer who will			1
it was up to me to rein in my clients who wanted to go beyond what was ethically permissible			0
let 's consider stockbrokers , also a profession that wallows in the pit of perceived low ethics			2
if your stockbroker had a tip for you that was not illegal but was ethically ambiguous , would you execute the trade based on that info if it could make you a nice payday ? or what about your accountant ? would you support her recommendation to take a " questionable " deduction that would save you a nice chunk of money ? honestly , have you ever heard someone brag that their lawyer , accountant or financial planner was the most ethical , honest person they ever met ? unlikely			1
but i bet you heard people say things like " my accountant is amazing at finding loopholes , " " my broker gets me great returns on my money every year " or " my lawyer is a killer			2
" we want the meat , but we do n't want to know how the calf is forced to live in a crate or how the lobster is boiled alive			0
we want tender veal , tasty seafood , lawyers who win cases and brokers who make us money			0
but when a poll comes around about ethics , we are all of a sudden holier than thou			2
we scoff at others ' apparent moral bankruptcy			1
we joke about their lack of ethics			0
we convince ourselves that we are ethically superior to them			0
yet in the very same instance , we re-elect them to @entity3			1
we retain them to represent us in legal proceedings			0
we hire them to manage our money			0
and when they do a good job , we recommend them to friends			0
so here are my real questions about this poll : who really are the unethical ones here ? who truly deserves to be on the bottom of the list of honest people ? them or us ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

a @entity20 poll says @entity3 has the second - lowest ethical standards of any profession
@entity192 : if we care about ethics , why did we re-elect 91 % of @entity3 in 2012 ?
no one brags that his or her lawyer or accountant is the most ethical , honest person , he says
we scoff at others ' apparent moral bankruptcy and *imagine* we are superior , he says
