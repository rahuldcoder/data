@entity0 -- what happens when you give thousand of cans of food to really creative people ? how about a " canned " tornado or an " uncanny " sculpture of an apple being eaten by ants			1
swarms of people are being delighted by the construction work in @entity0 's @entity14 during the city 's @entity15			1
on display are 25 sculptures created from more than 100,000 cans of food -- designed and built by architects and engineers			1
@entity23 , a structural engineer from the firm @entity24 , has been her team 's captain for five years			2
their entry " @entity28 " took three months to design and 10 hours to build			2
" the whole process is a lesson in project management			2
it 's certainly a challenge squeezing it in with the rest of our daily work , " said @entity23			2
@entity0 is one of about 100 cities around the world taking part in the international charity competition known as @entity41 that is aimed at helping the hungry			1
rules allow each team five people to work on their entry			2
the cans can not be bound with glue or adhesives and designers are not allowed to color the cans -- so there is endless time donated to finding the tuna or bean cans with the properly colored labels for the particular design			1
among the entries were an enormous mr. @entity59 , the original @entity61 board game , @entity62 , @entity64 babushka dolls and the @entity65 designed a train			1
" with some of the sculptures , you have to stand way back to see what has been created , " said @entity67 , a volunteer with @entity68 , one of the presenters of the competition			1
a representation of @entity76 and @entity77 of the " @entity79 " video games is one of those objects better seen from afar			0
children were especially excited to see the exhibits , snapping pictures and staring in awe			0
second - and third - graders of @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 , visited the site on a field trip			0
" this year we are teaching them about buildings , foundations and service projects so this is the perfect combination ! " said art teacher @entity92			0
the youngsters were running around the larger - than - life canned art feverishly trying to complete an assignment			0
@entity103 , a parent chaperone for the school , was trying to focus the kids ' excitement			0
" they have to sketch the different projects and write down how many cans each structure is made of and how many @entity0 will it feed , " @entity103 said			1
the children picked favorites but their top choices changed each time they saw the next structure down the line			0
" i love @entity76 , " one student said			0
" oh and this one too ! " he was pointing at another one			0
celebrity chef and cookbook author @entity121 and host of @entity125 's tv show " top chef : @entity128 " @entity127 are among this year 's judges who selected the winning sculptures			1
@entity41 is designed to raise hunger awareness during the @entity133 season			0
all of the cans used in the contest will be donated to @entity136 for distribution to programs that feed impoverished @entity0			1
