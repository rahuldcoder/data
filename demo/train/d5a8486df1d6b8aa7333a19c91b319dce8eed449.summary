-- @entity1 , the fifth - largest @entity2 wireless carrier , appears to be moving to bring more smartphones to lower - income consumers -- and also to capitalize on the @entity6 's new " open internet " rules which exempt wireless carriers from key net neutrality requirements			1
this mixed news could set a precedent that might eventually constrict the kind of mobile internet options available to all @entity2 mobile users			1
specifically , on january 3 @entity1 announced three tiers of plans for its new @entity18 network			2
here 's how the @entity19 summarized these flat - rate - per - month offerings : $ 40 " for unlimited talk , text , 4g web browsing with unlimited @entity25 access ; " $ 50 " for unlimited talk , text , 4g web services and unlimited @entity25 ; also international and premium text messaging , navigation , mobile instant messaging , corporate e-mail and 1 gb of additional data access			2
with @entity35 , customers also get audio capabilities to listen and download music and access to preview and trial video content ; " $ 60 " for the same premium features as the $ 50 plan , plus unlimited data access and @entity44 premium content such as 18 video - on - demand channels and audio downloads			0
" on the bright side , these @entity1 plans cost considerably less than most smartphone plans currently offered by @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53 -- which tend to cost at least $ 90 per month , with a two - year contract and high early termination fees			1
plus , the fact that these are no - contract plans means that customers have more flexibility to switch phones , plans or carriers at will to suit fluctuating budgets			0
such benefits might significantly influence the phone choices of many @entity2 mobile users			1
but on january 10 , a coalition of public interest groups -- including @entity69 , @entity70 , and the @entity71 -- sent a letter to the @entity6 asking the agency to investigate whether the @entity1 plans violate the few substantial net neutrality provisions which do apply to wireless carriers			1
under the new rules , mobile providers are forbidden to block access to lawful sites , as well as applications and online services that compete with the carrier 's voice or video telephony services			2
wireless carriers are permitted to slow delivery of certain content for the purposes of network management			0
however , they are required to be transparent with the @entity6 , consumers , and others about how they make these decisions -- and such transparency is so far lacking from the new @entity1 plans			1
in the big picture , the @entity1 plans might deepen the mobile digital divide by normalizing the practice of charging users more to get full mobile access to a free choice of internet services and content			1
this would disproportionately affect lower - income mobile users and people of color , who are more likely to rely more heavily on mobile devices for internet access			1
as the coalition explained : " being forced to pay an additional monthly fee for access to new or competing services creates barriers to consumer choice and experimentation , and jeopardizes the social and economic benefits associated with the @entity119			0
" @entity1 denies that its new plans will limit users ' online access			1
in a statement to the @entity19 , ceo @entity123 wrote : " the complaints about our new , pro-consumer , pro-competitive @entity18 rate plans are erroneous			0
we continue to offer consumers a full service , unlimited data plan			0
we increased consumer choice by adding two new rate plans that are less expensive and enable consumers to select the service and content they want at a price point they can afford			0
these new rate plans comply with the @entity6 's new rules on open mobile internet			1
" this year , i expect to see this mobile drama play out on the streets of my own city , @entity144 , @entity145			0
my recent survey of @entity144 mobile users indicated that @entity1 is the most popular carrier in this economically challenged city -- used by nearly half of those surveyed			1
only 30 % of respondents used smartphones ( a figure that reflects the national average ) , yet 80 % of respondents reported accessing the web from their phones daily or most days			0
this indicates a strong drive for mobile internet access			1
just under 40 % of those surveyed reported paying less than $ 50 per month for their phone			0
( the @entity1 " $ 40/everything " plan is especially popular around here			2
) and according to recently released @entity2 @entity166 data , @entity144 has a lower median per - household income than the national average			1
also , 17.5 % of @entity144 residents are officially living in poverty			0
internet access connects people to much more than @entity25 , @entity174 , and @entity175			0
it 's a portal to opportunity , learning , and much - needed services -- and these days it 's necessary in order to apply for many jobs or to interact with social service agencies			0
last december , @entity1 launched its 4g network in the @entity185 metro area -- and it 's reportedly live in @entity144 now			2
i suspect that if the smartphones that go along with the new @entity1 plans cost less than about $ 80 , many @entity187 will upgrade -- probably unaware of the limitations carefully built into these plans			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity194 .			0
