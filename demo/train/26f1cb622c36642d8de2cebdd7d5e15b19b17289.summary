-- the largest report yet into the extent of female genital mutilation , or cutting , has shed new light onto a practice that affects tens of millions of women and girls worldwide , u.n children 's agency @entity8 said			1
there is some positive news in the new @entity8 report , with data on trends revealing that the practice is becoming less common in more than half of the 29 countries where it is concentrated			2
@entity19 director : ' women will change the world ' but some 30 million girls remain at risk of being cut in the next decade unless efforts to eliminate the practice make more headway			1
more than 125 million girls and women alive today have undergone some form of female genital mutilation in 29 countries across @entity31 and the @entity32 , according to the report , " @entity34 : a statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change			1
" the practice -- which can carry serious health risks and is seen by the @entity19 as a human rights violation -- is found to a far lesser degree in other parts of the world , though the exact number of girls and women affected is unknown , said the report , published monday			2
@entity50 acceptance and preservation of virginity are the most commonly cited reasons for carrying it out in most countries , among men as well as women			0
the adoption by the @entity60 last december of a resolution intensifying global efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation marked " a milestone in global efforts to end the practice , " the report said			1
@entity0 special : impossible odds , unstoppable girls but cutting continues in some countries and ethnic groups , despite decades - long efforts to eliminate it -- and despite the fact that laws banning female genital mutilation at all ages have been passed in the majority of @entity31 nations			1
in some communities it is seen as a religious requirement , while in others it 's dictated by tradition			0
" in many countries , prevalence is highest among @entity88 girls and women			2
however , the practice is also found among other religious communities , " the @entity8 report said			2
cutting is nearly universal in @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , according to the report , but affects only one in 100 girls and women in @entity102 and @entity103			1
some girls undergo the practice while still babies , while others are cut as young girls or in their teens			0
the degree of harm inflicted by the practice also varies across communities			0
opinion : ' women 's rights violations not just developing nation issue ' " in @entity94 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity96 and @entity118 , more than one in five girls have undergone the most radical form of the practice , known as infibulation , which involves the cutting and sewing of the genitalia , " the report said			1
the downward trend in the practice is most marked in countries where it is less prevalent , the report said			2
in @entity132 and @entity133 , women age 45 to 49 are about three times more likely to have been cut than girls age 15 to 19 , @entity8 found			1
in @entity141 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 , adolescent girls are about half as likely to have been cut as women age 45 to 49			0
other countries where the practice is more widespread have also registered declines			0
they include @entity149 and @entity150 and , to a lesser extent , @entity97 , @entity116 , @entity95 , @entity152 and @entity153 , the report said			2
it also highlighted a gap between the support among women for female genital mutilation and its prevalence			1
" in most of the countries surveyed , ( the ) majority of girls and women who have undergone the practice do not see benefits to it and think that the practice should stop , " @entity8 statistics and monitoring specialist @entity161 is quoted as saying			2
" more mothers are aware " that female genital mutilation and cutting " can lead to their daughter 's , or a girl 's , death , " she says			1
" so , there is a better understanding of the consequences , which , in itself , is very important progress			0
" give @entity31 women a voice , ' say activists but many mothers who oppose the practice still have their daughters cut because of societal expectations , the study said , indicating that " efforts to end the practice need to go beyond a shift in individual attitudes and address entire communities			0
" the study also found that efforts by the many agencies campaigning for change are differentiated for various ethnic groups , some of which cross national boundaries , since cutting is much more common in some groups than others			0
men and boys , as well as girls , should be encouraged to talk about the practice , the report said			0
" this is especially important since the data indicate that girls and women tend to consistently underestimate the share of boys and men who want ( female genital mutilation ) to end			1
" another factor in eliminating cutting is promoting education and exposure to other communities , it added , with urban , wealthier and more educated families less likely to impose the practice on their daughters			0
" as many as 30 million girls are at risk of being cut over the next decade if current trends persist , " said @entity224 , deputy executive director of @entity8			1
" if , in the next decade , we work together to apply the wealth of evidence at our disposal , we will see major progress , " she said			0
" that means a better life and more hopeful prospects for millions of girls and women , their families and entire communities			0
