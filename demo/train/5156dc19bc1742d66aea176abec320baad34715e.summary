-- back in 1994 , when @entity2 led the @entity3 to take over the @entity4 , it was historic			2
why ? because @entity7 had held control of the @entity4 for the previous 40 years			1
hard to believe it ever worked that way			0
now voters demand change elections more often than they do n't			1
consider this : @entity15 win the @entity16 in 2002 , then lose it in 2006			1
the @entity7 hold the @entity16 until losing control of it last night -- predictions are that they might be in a good position to take it back in two years			1
at some point , someone might start listening : voters are steaming			1
they 're also not expecting @entity7 and @entity15 to suddenly write poetry together			1
but here 's one thing they do expect : competency			2
as in : figure out a way to do your job without continually kicking the proverbial cans down the road			0
in a pre-election interview with @entity0 earlier this week , vice president @entity35 told me that the " president and i have to figure out how to better communicate			0
" that may be true , but what happened last night is not a communications problem			0
it 's a governing problem			2
almost 8 out of 10 voters who voted yesterday do n't trust the government to do the right thing -- and the president runs the @entity4 and his party controlled the @entity16			1
so the voters , done with hope , voted change			2
the reason these races went down to the wire -- until the tidal wave became obvious when @entity7 could n't elect governors in blue states -- is that the voters did n't like either the @entity7 or the @entity15			1
but , as it turns out , when given the chance to express a preference , they decided they disliked president @entity62 the most , and sent the message loud and clear			1
sure , the larger issues of the economy and health care loomed large			0
two thirds of the country thinks the nation is headed down the wrong track			0
but the signal was loud and clear to @entity72 : figure out a way to get us going in the right direction			0
oddly enough , for a midterm election , the turning point came on a foreign policy matter			0
sources in campaigns for both @entity7 and @entity15 tell me they agree on this : when the president said he did n't have a strategy for @entity85 in @entity86 in late summer -- and then followed up by saying the administration had underestimated the strength of @entity85 -- polls started to shift			1
then came @entity91 , and the shift continued			0
" after he said that stuff , we all began to look at it very hard , " said one @entity3 strategist with a couple of wins under his belt today			0
" it was about refusing to take bold steps on big problems			2
it was n't a fluke , and that 's what we drove home			2
with one @entity3 strategist describing the disastrous @entity113 website rollout as " the @entity115 driver " of the competency issue , the narrative was set			0
@entity62 seemed afloat , the world out of control			1
and a @entity7 strategist confirms their numbers starting going south at that time too			1
" it was like defying gravity , " he told me			0
and that 's exactly why @entity7 separated from @entity62			1
only it did n't work			0
the question for @entity7 now is whether the @entity62 coalition survives without @entity62			1
right now , the party looks like a group of managers who have sliced up the electorate into gettable constituencies : women , minorities , young voters			2
but in this election , the @entity15 had a fresher playbook -- talking to suburban women worried about health care , with a good pack of candidates , and an improved political operation			0
here 's the rub : for a midterm election , it works to be the party simply against the incumbent			2
but there was n't any @entity3 game plan for the future			0
and there sure does n't seem to be a @entity7 one , either			1
at some point , the voters have to start believing the government -- and the people who are supposed to be running it -- works			1
or they will hold their noses and vote for change			0

@entity163 : voters are much less *patient* with politicians than in the past
they want a government that will act *effectively* to solve problems
she says strategists saw @entity7 lose ground in polls after @entity62 's @entity85 strategy comment
@entity163 : *uncertainty* over @entity179 *response* also hurt the @entity7
