@entity0 on wednesday became the latest state to have a federal judge strike down its same - sex marriage ban , thanks to a sweeping decision holding that its current prohibition has no " legitimate governmental purpose			1
" the ruling , by @entity11 - based judge @entity10 , will not take effect immediately : its enforcement has been stayed while the case works its way through the appeal process , meaning same - sex couples in @entity0 can not get married for the time being			1
still , gay rights supporters and activists believe the judgment -- because of what it says , how it follows similar rulings in other states and where it happened , in one of the most conservative states in the country -- has special significance			2
@entity34 chairman @entity33 called wednesday " a historic day for the lgbt community and the state of @entity0 , " while the @entity36 's head predicted the ruling " hastens the day when all loving couples who simply want the ability to share the benefits and responsibilities of marriage can			1
" @entity45 , one of the four plaintiffs that brought the lawsuit , pumped his fist in the air and cried " woo hoo ! " in reaction to what he called " an awesome first step			2
" " growing up , ( with ) my mom and dad , i envied their marriage because i really did n't think that i would be able to have something like that , " @entity45 , a 23 - year @entity55 @entity54 veteran , said alongside his partner @entity56			0
" and now ... reading that decision , it really was the first time i realized that , yeah , i can			0
" those on the other side of the debate , meanwhile , are promising to keep fighting			0
@entity0 attorney general @entity70 said his office will challenge the ruling , which would be heard by a federal appeals court in @entity74			1
the @entity75 is running for governor , with early primary voting now in full swing and the full primary election set for march 4			0
" the @entity55 @entity80 has ruled over and over again that states have the authority to define and regulate marriage , " said @entity70			0
" the @entity84 defines marriage as between one man and one woman			0
" gov. @entity87 , who is not running for re-election , offered even more forceful remarks , insisting that the 10th amendment of the @entity94 " guarantees @entity0 voters the freedom " to decide on the parameters for marriage			2
" @entity98 spoke loud and clear by overwhelmingly voting to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman ... , and it is not the role of the federal government to overturn the will of our citizens , " said @entity87 , an outspoken conservative who ran for president in 2012			2
" ... this is yet another attempt to achieve via the courts what could n't be achieved at the ballot box			0
" in november 2005 , @entity0 became the 19th state to adopt a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage			1
whether homosexual couples should be allowed to wed like heterosexual ones was a hot - button issue then and in subsequent years , with polls showing that most @entity55 favored restrictions			0
but public opinion shifted over time			0
a @entity122 / @entity121 survey last june found a majority -- 55 % -- of @entity55 back same - sex marriage , up 11 percentage points from 2008			1
a total of 17 states now allow such legal unions , due to actions by voters , state courts or their legislatures			1
federal courts have also helped move the needle on the issue , especially over the past year			1
the most significant such move came last june , when the @entity80 rejected parts of the @entity138 while ruling same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits			1
the justices did n't go as far as saying that all states must allow such marriages to take place within their borders , but a number of lower federal courts have since stepped in to the fray			1
federal judges have ruled that gay marriage bans in @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 violate the @entity55 @entity94			2
judge @entity10 echoed his colleagues wednesday with respect to @entity0 , saying that " equal treatment of all individuals under the law is not merely an aspiration it is a constitutional mandate			2
" " ( the @entity0 law ) is unconstitutional because , without a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose , it denies same - sex couples the benefits , dignity and value of celebrating marriage and having their out - of - state marriage recognized , " the judge said			1
in his ruling , @entity10 raised notable arguments from some supporters of same - sex marriage bans : that allowing such unions would hurt children raised in them , that it would stifle procreation and that it " could lead to the recognition of bigamy , incest , pedophilia and group marriage			1
" the judge then shot down the defense 's case			2
" @entity189 is not and has never been a qualification for marriage " and " tradition , alone , can not form a rational basis for a law			0
" @entity0 has " the ' unquestioned authority ' to regulate and define marriage , " but only " in a way that does not infringe on an individual 's constitutional rights , " @entity10 added			2
" it is clear that ( the four plaintiffs ) suffer humiliation and discriminatory treatment under the law on the basis of their sexual orientation , and this stigmatic harm flows directly from @entity0 ' ban on same - sex marriage , " the judge wrote			1
" ( @entity0 ' law also ) causes needless stigmatization and humiliation for children being raised by the loving same - sex couples being targeted			1
" after the ruling , all the key players acknowledged the fight is n't over			0
ultimately , it may fall to the @entity80 to decide whether the gay marriage bans in @entity0 and a host of other states are legal under the @entity55 @entity94			1
for now , though , the @entity0 plaintiffs are celebrating			0
@entity56 says the courts ' decision " are going to put an end " to stories like his as a youngster , going to bed " knowing they 're gay and praying that they wo n't wake up			0
" that sentiment was echoed by @entity232 , who is raising a child with her partner and fellow plaintiff @entity234			0
" it 's a huge victory for us , but it is also a victory for young people that do n't have to go through the process that we all went through growing up -- of daring to dream , " @entity232 told reporters			0
" they will have the same dreams from the time that they 're little that their parents had			0
and i think that that 's amazing			0
