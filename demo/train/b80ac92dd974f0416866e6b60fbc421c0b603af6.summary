-- pundit @entity1 recently wrote : " so as i understand it , @entity2 is now the bad guy in " to kill a mockingbird , " because he doubted a story about rape			1
" how right he was			0
a story with a rape allegation carries an immediate electric charge			1
in @entity14 's @entity13 , lynchings often came with a story of the victim having raped a white girl			1
with the energy of such a story , it was n't too hard to whip up a fury strong enough to leave a man hanging from a tree			1
the " rape propaganda " was necessary to garner the emotions necessary to press the real , dark , agenda			1
@entity27 took a page out of the old @entity13 's playbook and brought us @entity31 , who accused six white men of raping her			0
the story of white on black crime resonated , and it helped to promote a social justice agenda , but @entity31 was no more a rape victim than two white women in @entity37 , @entity38 , who falsely accused nine black teenagers more than 80 years ago			1
what do these stories have in common ? someone had an agenda , and they knew that a rape story would put it on a rocket powered toboggan			1
and , therein lies the origin of today 's " rape culture " frenzy			1
this is not to say that there are not unreported and unprosecuted sexual assaults			0
i have dear friends who suffered such injustice , and i believe their stories with every drop of blood in my body			0
i 'll bet that nearly everyone knows someone who has a verifiably true story			1
but , is that really " rape culture ? " what does that silly phrase mean ? it means the same thing as @entity14 stories of rape meant			1
it means the same thing that @entity31 meant			1
it means that someone has an agenda , and they want to harness the emotional power of rape to promote it			1
which brings us to the @entity84			1
when @entity88 's @entity87 story about a gang rape in a @entity84 frat house hit the presses , it went viral			1
why ? it was like a horror movie			0
i 'll admit that when i read it , my own prejudices rose up , and i believed " @entity97 " ( the victim in the story )			2
i thought of my friends who had been harmed and could n't even begin to doubt that " @entity97 " was telling the truth			0
why would n't i believe her ? the antagonists were a bunch of over-privileged white fraternity jerks from @entity84 , it seemed			1
the victim was yet another young woman who had had justice withheld			0
the story confirmed what i wanted to believe : that the elite run roughshod over the rest of us			1
it proved so much , and i " knew " which side was right			0
and it confirmed the bias of left - wing academics who have collectively decided that the " war on boys " must have more victims , because everything with a penis is a rapist			2
as the story burned , cries of " rape culture " started to sound less like fairy tales and more like factual reports			1
all of a sudden , embattled sexual harassment policies on college campuses started to look good , perhaps unquestionable			0
these policies that have been attacked by those who still believe in that quaint notion known as due process , and the tide started to turn			1
the @entity137 recently ran the story of @entity139 , who found himself falsely accused , and immediately judged guilty by mere suspicion			2
but then we had @entity97			0
rape culture was real , after all ! and then someone dared to question the story			1
how could he ? this account was not published in some rag -- this was @entity87 , a publication of editorial ethics			2
some schools of feminist thought consider questioning a victim to be utterly taboo			0
if she said it , then it must be true			0
such is the mentality of those who would lynch @entity2 , or at least call for his disbarment , if he were practicing in modern day @entity162			0
" @entity97 " may not be @entity164 , " @entity166 's " faux victim			0
i was n't there in that @entity84 frat house			1
nevertheless , the " journalist " who brought us the story has now been revealed to have been , at least , lazy and willfully blind to the holes in @entity97 's story			2
she claims that she never asked the men in the story for their account of events because of an agreement with @entity97			2
and therein lie so many problems			0
this is the kind of " believe the victim " mentality that is so darkly infecting academia			0
" presumed guilty " is the new standard			0
@entity139 is the new @entity187 , the black man accused of the rape in " to kill a mockingbird			2
" due process loses , ethics are out the window , because there is an agenda , and it needs the fuel of a rape story			1
and who loses ? the casualty list is still being compiled			2
terrible journalism or not , maybe @entity97 was telling the truth			0
if she was lying , the @entity84 @entity202 system already paid a terrible price			1
if she was telling the truth , she wo n't ever be believed now			0
why ? because @entity88 was so utterly void of journalistic ethics that she committed " journalistic malpractice			2
" because now , nobody will believe @entity97			0
and after @entity88 's lazy journalism , the next girl who reports a rape might find it to be that much more difficult to get to justice			2
i do n't know what @entity88 's agenda was , but it was n't responsible journalism			2
it is n't public relations			0
a responsible journalist digs for the truth , she does n't just take her subject 's agenda and run with it			0
that is n't journalism , that 's " gossip , " and like all gossip , it does n't do anything positive for anyone .			0
