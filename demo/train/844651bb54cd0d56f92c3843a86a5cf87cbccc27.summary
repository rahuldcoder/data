" @entity2 " and " @entity3 " may be coming to the @entity0 -- sealed with a @entity1			1
grunge groundbreakers @entity4 , disco dynamos @entity6 and the costume - clad , @entity9 - led pop metal band @entity1 are among 16 nominees up for election in the museum 's class of 2014			1
the deep selection also includes ' 70s and ' 80s hitmakers @entity16 ; college radio heroes the @entity19 ; @entity20 funkmeisters the @entity21 ; sweet - voiced @entity22 ; and pioneering gangsta rappers n.w.a. completing the list : the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31			2
the list spans more than six decades of rock and pop history and includes both major pop successes -- @entity36 , @entity27 , @entity22 and yes all hit no. 1 on @entity38 's hot 100 singles chart -- and influential players			2
@entity42 , for example , had just two top 40 singles , " @entity44 " and " @entity45 , " but his dirty , heavily distorted sound proved a precursor for every power - chording shredder who 's ever picked up a guitar			2
" the musical equivalent of football 's forearm shiver , " critic @entity51 wrote of " @entity44 " in " @entity52 , " his compendium of 1,001 great singles			0
" photos : 2013 @entity0 inductees and @entity60 , which put out just three studio albums in its short career , made them count			1
the blunt " @entity74 , " off the second album " @entity75 , " became a cause celebre upon its release in 1988 -- even the @entity66 was concerned enough to send letters to the group 's record company -- and " @entity73 , " the group 's final record , hit no. 1			0
most controversial song lyrics " in many ways the most notorious group in the history of rap , " writes @entity78 's @entity77			0
members @entity83 , @entity85 and dr. @entity86 all went on to even bigger things , with dr. @entity86 , in particular , becoming perhaps the most notable producer in hip - hop history			0
rock fans may be particularly invested in the fates of @entity4 , which kicked off the grunge era with its classic 1991 album " nevermind , " and @entity1 , which -- despite mixed critical notices during its 1970s heyday -- built a roaring fan base called the " @entity101 " on the backs of incessant touring , pyrotechnic stage shows and several hit albums			1
as the @entity0 says in a press release , " few bands short of the @entity103 inspired more kids to pick up the guitar than @entity1			1
" but the other nominees should n't be overlooked			1
@entity6 , known for such hits as " @entity109 " and " @entity3 , " was perhaps the best of the disco groups , and its leaders -- guitarist @entity114 , bassist @entity116 and drummer @entity117 -- moved smoothly into the ' 80s thanks to their sleek studio work			0
the group 's sound is still prominent : @entity114 recently popped up on the @entity36 - like @entity121 single " @entity122			0
" and the @entity19 managed to combine affecting songwriting -- usually courtesy of @entity124 -- with passionate ( if occasionally shambling ) performances , such as those heard on the songs " @entity128 , " " unsatisfied " and " @entity129			0
" besides , the hall may need to find a place for a band that titled an album , " @entity134			0
" voting will be open to fans through december 10			1
