-- it was a love affair begun long before the levees broke			2
from left , @entity4 's @entity3 , @entity5 of @entity6 and @entity7 perform at the @entity9 in 2006			1
before the images of a crowded and toxic @entity9 and desperate survivors waving down help from rooftops , entertainers the world over had a special place in their hearts for @entity18 -- the sultry @entity20 city that served as muse to musicians , playwrights and novelists for more than a century before @entity25 roared into the city four years ago this week			1
celebrity response to disasters was nothing new			2
from @entity32 's @entity31 in 1971 to @entity33 and @entity34 in the early ' 80s , musicians and others have acted in times of need			2
but something about @entity25 -- something about @entity18 -- spurred an unprecedented response from the entertainment world that continues four years later , experts and activists say			1
" anybody , whether they 're a performer or not , who has studied or been touched by @entity46 music has been touched by @entity18 , " said @entity42 , director of the nonprofit aid group @entity43			1
... for everybody of every generation who 's making music in @entity46 , there 's a touchstone in @entity18 that has affected their work			0
" in the days after the floods , many of the rich and famous stepped up with perhaps the most obvious response , writing a check			2
@entity64 donated $ 1 million to @entity65 and @entity66 added another million through her @entity67 and urged her famous friends to follow suit			1
director @entity70 gave $ 750,000 to the @entity71 and another $ 750,000 to the @entity72			1
hip - hop stars @entity73 and @entity75 pitched in with big checks , as did actor @entity77 and singers @entity78 and @entity80			0
@entity81 donated the proceeds of a song , " from the @entity89 , " to relief efforts and actor @entity85 raised $ 600,000 -- including $ 200,000 paid for a date with @entity87 -- through a celebrity auction			2
others took more direct action			1
@entity93 flew relief supplies into the region on his private plane , @entity92 took a private boat ( albeit a leaky one ) into @entity18 to rescue people			1
@entity99 founded the @entity100 , an organization dedicated to rebuilding the @entity101 in @entity18			0
almost to a person , the performers who stepped up cited a special love for the city 's artistic tradition -- from the @entity108 brass bands that invented jazz in the city 's streets to the colorful @entity113 krewes whose elaborate floats and costumes are an emblem of the city 's annual pre-lent bacchanal			2
@entity4 guitarist @entity3 helped form @entity121 , a group initially dedicated to providing instruments for @entity18 musicians who had lost their own during the floods			1
the group gave instruments to 2,700 musicians from the @entity129 before shifting its focus to helping churches and schools rebuild their music programs			0
" the @entity18 tragedy was a twofold tragedy , " @entity3 said in 2006 during the city 's jazzfest			1
" it was a tragedy because of the fact that this great city was devastated , but it was a tragedy because of the incredible music culture that was also destroyed			0
" as the city continues to struggle , assistance is still arriving in a way that 's different from the aftermath of most disasters , experts said			2
" there have been some institutions created as a result of it , " said @entity148 , director of the @entity149 's @entity150			0
" it has sort of garnered ongoing attention , not from the general public as much as from organized philanthropy			0
" a key difference in the case of @entity25 was the 24 - hour media coverage the disaster received , at least some of which was spurred by celebrity responses , @entity148 said			1
" obviously , that 's one of the assets that a celebrity brings to an endeavor , " @entity148 said			0
" it gets attention ; it gets name recognition			0
" celebrity interest in @entity25 , like other public causes , did n't come without some criticism			1
the @entity25 response was part of what led @entity178 to dub 2005 the " year of @entity179			1
" some accused celebrities at the time of donating or volunteering simply to gain positive publicity or to take a swipe at then - president @entity185 and perceptions his administration responded slowly and inadequately to the disaster			0
there were reports that @entity92 invited photographers to follow him during his boat rescue , a claim he denied and attributed to a single tabloid newspaper that spread the story			1
@entity92 , who had filmed a remake of the film " all the @entity199 " in @entity18 and other parts of @entity20 , said getting attention was n't a concern during his mission , which he said rescued 40 people			1
" you know , it does n't really matter , " he told @entity0 's @entity207 on september 7 , 2005			0
" the point was that , out of the benefit of celebrity , i could afford to get on an airplane and get down there			0
and we got a lot of people out of the water			0
the rest is for people to talk about			0
" @entity42 , whose @entity43 focuses on helping musicians and members of @entity18 ' famous @entity113 krewes , said there 's value in celebrity support , not just in their ability to raise or donate funds , but to spread the word and keep the story of @entity18 alive			2
" they have fans that are listening to them and are interested in their point of view , " said @entity42 , whose organization has benefited from concerts by acts including the @entity231 , @entity232 and former @entity234 front man @entity233			0
" when an artist shares their point of view with an audience , that carries weight			0

even before @entity25 , entertainers had a special place in their hearts for @entity43
@entity25 spurred unprecedented response from entertainment world that continues
@entity64 , @entity66 , @entity70 and others donated millions
others like @entity93 , @entity92 and @entity3 of @entity4 took more direct action
