-- parents often ask me whether spanking is really so bad			0
after all , they were spanked as kids and they turned out fine			0
plus , it 's the only thing that will get their child to listen , they say			0
much research has focused on the effects that severe child abuse can have on a person 's mental well - being			0
but a new study published in the july issue of the journal @entity18 takes a look at the possible link between mental health disorders and harsh physical punishment in the absence of abuse			1
the findings may persuade parents not to spank at all			0
researchers from @entity28 found that physical punishment ( such as slapping , hitting , pushing and shoving ) -- even without child neglect or physical , sexual or emotional abuse -- was linked to mood disorders , anxiety disorders , substance abuse and personality disorders			1
when does spanking become abuse ? while it may be true that many of today 's parents were spanked as children and are now well - adjusted , previous studies have also shown that those who were spanked are at a higher risk to be depressed ; use alcohol ; hit their spouse or own children ; and engage in violent or criminal behaviors			1
physical punishment does n't help , it hurts the @entity48 and the @entity49 discourage spanking and other forms of physical punishment			1
it is unlawful in 32 countries -- not including the @entity55 or @entity28 -- for parents and other caregivers to use physical punishment against children			2
the new study 's lead author , @entity60 , said she believes that physical punishment should not be used on children of any age and that positive parenting strategies should instead be encouraged			1
preferred methods of discipline do not include physical punishment			2
for example , withholding privileges , using time - outs and offering consequences ( for example , " if you throw your toy and it breaks , you wo n't be able to play with it anymore " )			0
african - americans most likely to use physical punishment dr. @entity79 , a pediatrician in @entity80 and clinical professor of pediatrics at @entity83 , recommends praising children when they are behaving well and using time - outs or a process called " time off , " in which the child must go to another part of the house for as long as it takes to stop the offending behavior and behave normally again			1
what are your thoughts on spanking ? if you are a parent who uses spanking for discipline , will this study change your mind ? where do you draw the line between physical discipline and abuse ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity106 .			2
