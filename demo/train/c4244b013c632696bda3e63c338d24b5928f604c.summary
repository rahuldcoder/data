-- in 2009 , @entity2 heir @entity1 , 47 , was convicted of raping his 3 - year - old daughter and served no jail time because , a judge said , he would " not fare well " in prison			1
you are only just hearing about this travesty thanks to a civil suit filed recently by @entity11 ' ex-wife , @entity11 , alleging that he also sexually abused his 19 - month - old son during the same period			1
how does this happen ? lady justice wears a blindfold that 's supposed to represent objectivity			1
unfortunately , it seems to blind her in some cases , especially when a defendant is wealthy and connected			0
and @entity11 is wealthy and connected -- he 's the heir to not one , but two fortunes provided to him by his predecessors			1
in 2008 , @entity11 was indicted on two counts of second - degree child rape for sexually penetrating his daughter repeatedly from 2005 to 2007			1
those two counts would have carried mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years each			0
he was released on $ 60,000 bail			0
@entity11 is unemployed , but with a trust fund and apparently had plenty of cash to hire one of the state 's top law firms			0
his lawyers pushed until @entity40 prosecutors offered a deal allowing him the fourth - degree rape plea -- normally reserved for statutory rape cases -- and @entity11 admitted the assault			2
at the sentencing , @entity47 judge @entity46 ordered @entity11 to attend a sex offender rehabilitation program and pay a whopping $ 4,395 to the @entity50			1
( that 'll teach him ! ) she then sentenced him to eight years in prison , but suspended the prison time and put him on probation instead , writing : " defendant will not fare well in level 5 setting			1
" translation for the rest of the world : the rich rapist will " fare well " living as a free man in a house where he raped his own daughter			1
a few points here : 1			0
the purpose of prison is twofold -- to keep criminals segregated from their victims and the rest of society , to punish them by denying them the freedoms that law - abiding citizens enjoy and to rehabilitate them			2
prisons are loaded with pedophile rapists who are incarcerated regardless of their ability to deal with the prison environment			2
if @entity11 was a relative of the @entity80 , instead of the @entity81 he 'd probably be behind bars now			0
and if the rapist does n't " fare well " in prison , how is he a good fit for society ? as far as i 'm concerned , a sex offender who rapes his own child will never " fare well " in society			1
you ca n't cure sex offenders of their sexual urges , you can only teach them to try to control them			2
in the meantime , we have a duty to keep rapists like @entity11 contained in a location where they have no contact or opportunity to hurt another child for a good long time -- and that place is in jail			1
the @entity40 justice system appears to have also lost sight of @entity11 ' victim -- his own kid ! think she 'll " fare well " knowing her rapist was sent home to his mansion and never properly punished ? the sentence was outrageous , but blaming the judge is too easy			1
the truth is the entire system is to blame			0
people with zero resources to properly defend themselves are funneled into the prison system , while rich rapists like @entity11 can buy an excellent criminal defense team and secure a deal no public defender could ever dream of getting			2
but @entity11 has not given up			0
she filed a suit last month seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of her children			2
in addition to detailing the abuse of his daughter , the lawsuit also alleges that while @entity132 was on probation , he admitted to the sexual abuse of his toddler son			1
it cites probation reports from two different probation officers notifying the @entity139 in 2010 and 2012 about that suspected abuse			0
according to the lawsuit , which is supported by paperwork from the earlier criminal case , @entity11 went into his daughter 's room while she slept and penetrated her with his fingers while he masturbated			2
the suit also alleges that @entity11 then told the girl " to keep what he had done to her a secret			0
" the girl eventually told her grandmother , who informed @entity11			0
the girl then recounted the abuse to her pediatrician and @entity161 police , who arrested him			0
given all this background , it may seem like a slam dunk of a civil suit , but societal factors -- the advantages of money -- can play a large role in the justice system			1
you can be certain that if @entity11 lives off a trust , it 's one that du pont family attorneys have painstakingly set up , and it 's probably going to be remarkably hard to pierce			0
likely knowing she 's in for a fight , @entity11 has hired law firm @entity178 & @entity180 , attorneys more than capable of going after people who think they are untouchable			0
this is the firm that won victims $ 77.4 million in a settlement with the @entity187 of @entity188 over sex abuse by a priest			0
i 've got my fingers crossed that a civil jury will award jaw - dropping damages in this case and strip @entity11 of the trust fund and the wealthy status that allowed him to avoid jail -- where he really belongs .			1

@entity201 : @entity2 heir @entity202 did no jail time in rape of his toddler daughter
sentencing judge said , in part , he " would not fare well " in prison . this is not justice
@entity213 : wealth should n't *shield* him from justice
@entity213 : civil jury should award big damages strip him of wealth that helped him avoid jail
