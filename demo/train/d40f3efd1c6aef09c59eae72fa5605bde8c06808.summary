@entity5 struggled from the outset , losing two wickets in the day 's opening over and added just 32 runs to their overnight total of 241 - 7			1
that gave the @entity21 a first - innings lead of 18 runs , and it looked like the home side might also find batting difficult when makeshift opener @entity26 continued his miserable series , falling leg before wicket to spinner @entity31 for 15			1
but @entity1 and @entity11 set about the @entity33 attack , who gained no profit from a controversial incident when seamer @entity37 stood on the ball with his studded boots before lunch when it was still relatively new			2
@entity1 survived a series of close calls and decision referrals as the duo set a new test highest mark for the second wicket at the venue			1
the opener thought he was out soon after reaching his 19th century in the five - day format , but @entity5 wicketkeeper @entity51 admitted that the edge off seamer @entity53 had not carried			2
@entity11 finally fell to a bat - pad catch by @entity55 off @entity31 , falling five runs short of his eighth @entity58 ton as he hit 14 boundaries off 156 deliveries			0
first - innings centurion @entity61 was unbeaten on 20 at stumps , with @entity1 having plundered 22 boundaries in his 243 balls at the crease			1
earlier , @entity67 ( 5 - 75 ) took two wickets in two balls to put @entity5 on the back foot , with @entity31 caught at slip by @entity1 for five from a fierce rising delivery and @entity73 following in identical fashion			1
prior , who was 52 overnight , hit out to get @entity5 close to parity before dragging a short ball from @entity79 ( 4 - 74 ) onto his wicket to be last out for 76			0
@entity5 coach @entity81 said wednesday 's morning session would prove vital for his side , who lead 1 - 0 after winning the second test			2
" we have got to attack with the new ball			0
we have seen wickets fall early on all the days so far			0
we have definitely got to attack early , " the former @entity90 international player said			0
" the first two days produced very difficult batting conditions , today was easier			0
we do n't know what sort of conditions are going to arrive tomorrow			0
if it plays as easy as it has today , we have got a chance			0
