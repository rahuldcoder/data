-- pressure is inescapable in the cauldron of @entity4 competition -- pressure and ping pong			1
the intense rivalry played out on the course between the world 's top players from @entity11 and the @entity12 in golf 's ultimate team test is only half the story			2
away from the heat of battle on the greens and fairways , there is a wiff - waff war raging in the @entity12 team room , one @entity16 ca n't wait to get stuck into			1
" once the @entity4 actually starts it 's just fun from there -- very intense , " @entity16 tells @entity0 's @entity25 show			1
" i enjoy the off - course too -- just being in the team room , spending time as a team , hanging out , playing ping pong ! " and hopefully if we can get that @entity4 then sunday night would be pretty good			1
" @entity32 hired a coach before last year 's @entity34 in a bid to blow away his teammates on the table , but this time his erstwhile ping pong partner @entity38 is missing through injury			1
perhaps @entity16 is the man to fill the void on both counts			2
the @entity43 's golf is certainly in fine shape after a stellar season in which he finished in the top five of each of this year 's four major championships , a feat only previously achieved by @entity38 and @entity51			1
entry to an illustrious club that boasts 32 major titles is a measure of @entity16 's progress , notwithstanding the residual disappointment at not converting one of those opportunities			2
twice , at the @entity60 and most notably at the @entity61 , @entity16 was pipped to the crown by @entity64 's @entity63 , who has vowed to lead @entity11 's charge for the @entity4 in @entity66 this week			1
given @entity16 's consistency in 2014 , it is possible to make a case for him as the spearhead of a @entity12 team that has not won the @entity4 since 2008			1
defeat at @entity72 in @entity73 back in 2010 was @entity16 's first taste of the tournament , but he was omitted for the infamous " @entity76 " in 2012 when @entity11 stormed from 10 - 4 behind to take the cup in dramatic fashion			1
that has only sharpened his focus ahead of the 40th incarnation of the prestigious event at @entity83			0
" with the past few cups going to @entity11 i feel like this is one that we need to win , " @entity16 says			2
" i feel like @entity83 is a good venue for the @entity12 and i feel like we are putting together a good team			0
" i am excited to be on the team and , being on there in 2010 and coming up short , i want to be on the other side of that this year			0
" the 25 - year - old 's debut four years ago came courtesy of a wildcard pick by captain @entity98			1
he 'd been part of the @entity12 's success on @entity102 shores the previous year in the @entity103 -- the @entity4 's amateur equivalent -- which gave him a head start			1
@entity16 , the third - youngest golfer to play in the @entity4 behind @entity106 and @entity38 , was forced to find his feet quickly			1
playing foursomes alongside veteran @entity109 , @entity16 took a drop from the mud early in their contest with @entity114 and @entity115 , but dropped a different ball to the original , costing the @entity12 the hole			1
despite being behind for 16 of 17 holes , @entity16 held his nerve to make a birdie putt on the last and rescue half a point for his side			0
then on the final day as a nailbiting , weather - afflicted tussle neared its climax , @entity16 birdied four of his final six holes to snatch an unlikely half point from his match with @entity130 's @entity129 and keep the overall contest alive			2
though @entity132 , that year 's @entity133 champion , closed out a 14½ - 13½ victory for @entity11 in the final singles match , @entity16 had shown he belonged on the transatlantic stage			1
" the @entity4 2010 -- it was special for me because i had just turned pro basically a year prior , " he recalls			2
" i came off playing the @entity103 in ' 07 and ' 09 so i was ready for the stage and i definitely enjoyed it			0
" i put myself in a position where i was able to help the team have a chance at getting the @entity4 but we were just a little too far back to make it happen			0
" the @entity4 represents a rare week in the calendar where golfers are n't wholly operating as lone wolves -- and they play for pride , not cash			0
this altered reality demands different traits and often brings out the best in some players -- @entity11 talisman @entity154 being a prime example			0
it also means a sense of shared responsibility , a nation and teammates to do proud			0
" the team events are so much different than a week - to - week tournament or even majors , " @entity16 explains			2
" you are playing for so much more than just yourself			0
you know you have got your fellow teammates , the captains and not to mention your country			0
" when you do play the alternate - shot matches there is a bit of teamwork there with the guy you are paired with			0
but golf is still very individual			0
" i mean you go out there and really all you can control is your emotions and the shots you hit -- you may be able to go and show support for other teammates but for the most part it about everyone coming together and playing well			0
" so it is just fun to have that little extra added pressure and to play well and feel the satisfaction that you did it for your teammates , the captains and then your country			0

@entity16 says 2014 @entity4 is one @entity12 " need " to win
