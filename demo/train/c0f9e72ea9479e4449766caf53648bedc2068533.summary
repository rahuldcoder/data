@entity0 -- the @entity2 tuesday ordered a nationwide halt to " opposite direction " runway operations , in which planes arrive on runways in one direction and depart in the other , as the result of an investigation into last week 's incident at @entity13 involving three planes which came dangerously close			1
@entity2 acting administrator @entity15 ordered the temporary halt , saying the agency discovered it has " no standard protocol " for switching from a one - way runway traffic pattern to the less common two - way pattern			1
the lack of a standard protocol likely contributed to the july 31 mishap , he said			2
during last week 's incident , a southbound @entity25 regional jet arriving at @entity13 came in close proximity to two northbound jets taking off from the airport			1
at their closest , two planes came within 0.82 nautical miles , less than the required 3.0 nautical miles			0
in a memo released tuesday , @entity15 repeated his initial statement that the aircraft were never on a head - to - head collision course			1
and he again blamed the mishap on a miscommunication between the @entity36 , a regional radar facility , and managers at @entity13 's control tower			1
but the investigation has altered one key understanding of the incident			0
@entity43 and @entity2 officials originally told reporters that the misunderstanding occurred as controllers " flipped " the direction of the airport , switching all traffic from a northbound direction to a southbound direction			1
now @entity15 says the regional @entity36 controller intended to change the direction of only the arriving aircraft , allowing " opposite direction " traffic on the runway			2
controllers sometimes allow two - way traffic to comply with noise restrictions or to accommodate cargo operations , he said			2
takeoffs and landings are staggered to avoid collisions			0
while changing from one - way traffic to two - way traffic encompasses many of the same procedures as flipping an airport , " there is no standard protocol in place , " @entity15 wrote			2
" we believe this contributed to the miscommunication			0
" @entity15 said he is halting two - way runway traffic " out of an abundance of caution , " and that the @entity2 expects to have standard procedures in place within a month			1
@entity15 said the @entity13 incident also raised the issue that the @entity2 's front - line managers are managing administrative tasks in addition to overseeing tower operations			1
" we need to be sure that they are solely focused on the operations in the facility and not handling administrative duties " during busy times , he wrote			0
the 2 p.m. incident involved three aircraft : @entity93 3072 , @entity94 3329 and @entity95			0
all three aircraft were operating as @entity97			0
all reached their destinations safely .			0

lack of protocols for switching runway traffic patterns led to temporary halt , @entity2 says
in incident at @entity13 , southbound plane got too close to two northbound planes
@entity2 : planes were never on head - to - head collision course
