@entity0 , @entity1 -- standing under a large poster of @entity6 's @entity5 , @entity3 lays out large rolls of red , green , white and black cloth on his workshop table			2
these are the colors of his homeland , one he hopes will soon become a fully recognized state			2
the flag - maker marks the cloth in precise shapes before cutting different colored layers as the hum of a sewing machine is heard from a small room next door			2
the @entity22 home in the @entity1 city of @entity0 has been bustling with activity lately , as they seek to meet the increased demand for @entity28 flags ahead of an expected move by the @entity30 to seek statehood at the @entity32 next week			1
having cut the cloth , @entity3 and his wife , together with his nephew @entity35 , sit in a small room , filled with textiles , threads of different colors , and three small tables			2
perched upon each table is an old sewing machine , like a relic of a bygone era			2
like clockwork , the pieces of cloth here are passed between them			2
first , @entity3 's nephew , @entity35 , sews the pieces together , passes them to @entity3 's wife , who passes the flag - in - making on to him , who quickly adds the finishing touches and lays it on a pile of flags on the table next to him			1
during the past few weeks the three of them have sewn over fifteen thousand flags says @entity3 , who has been doing this for over 40 years			1
his profession has even landed him behind bars in an @entity68 prison			2
" during the first intifada we were only producing a very small quantity of flags because it was forbidden , but when the @entity30 arrived we started producing huge quantities , " he explains			1
at a time when business is slow , @entity3 welcomes the @entity30 's @entity32 initiative and the public relations campaign behind it			1
he says it has brought him fresh business , at a time when the global economy and foreign competition has made his job more difficult than ever			2
" during the second intifada we also produced large quantities of flags , but when people started importing the flags from outside with cheaper prices , it was not that good business , " @entity3 says , remembering that he used to be able to charge the equivalent of about seven dollars for a flag			1
he says he would be lucky to get four dollars today			0
" we used to do thousands of flags before people start importing the flags from @entity98 , it 's something that affected the prices dramatically			1
it caused us to stop producing , " he says			0
but money is not the driving factor for the flag maker , rather he is driven by the dream of finally having a @entity28			1
" this flag that we sew and will continue to sew , we hope we will see it raised at the @entity32 with the rest of the world			1
this is our hope , and we are sure that one day our flags will be raised in the @entity32 and on every international occasion			1
it is a dream that is coming true , and we hope that our brothers , the @entity112 , will support us , " the flag makers say			0
@entity35 , @entity3 's nephew , agrees			0
" money is not the issue here , what is important is to have a state where we can live in dignity , where we can go wherever we want , where we can visit our holy places and walk our streets without having soldiers stopping us and asking for @entity122			0
this would be much better than any quantity of money			0
business is important , but living in freedom and dignity is much more important , " @entity35 says			0
@entity129 has been running a printing business just down the road from @entity3 's flag factory since the 1980 's			0
cardboard boxes full of flyers , posters , and small printed flags are stacked in the corner of the room			1
nearby , workers use a hot press to flatten the freshly printed flags and others print large posters adorned with the picture of the late @entity28 leader @entity145 standing next to current @entity30 president @entity146			1
like his friend @entity3 , @entity129 welcomes the extra income the @entity28 statehood campaign has brought , and he too believes the dream it carries is important			1
" we have been dreaming of having a state since the beginning of occupation			0
people were very positive towards this campaign			0
here in @entity159 everybody is supporting this idea			0
we hope to have the support from the @entity112 states and the whole world , " he says			0
although he , like many , sees the likelihood of @entity30 success at the @entity32 @entity167 as very low , @entity164 - @entity129 says he is hopeful that the @entity28 push for statehood will bring change			1
read what @entity68 's prime minister thinks about the @entity28 bid " the flag today has a special meaning , before we used to fight in order to raise it			1
the flag used to be raised and then the @entity68 soldiers used to take it down and now the flag is in a way of getting sovereignty and recognition			0
now 130 countries recognize us and are ready to support us , i think it 's a dream that could come true , " he says			0
sitting behind his sewing machine @entity3 sighs when asked whether he thinks the @entity30 will succeed with its effort this month			1
" if we do n't succeed in september , it wo n't be the end and we will continue the resistance until our flag is raised everywhere			0
i will continue sewing the flag and i will never get bored of it			0
this is our flag , this is our pride and we will continue raising it all of our lives , " he said .			0
