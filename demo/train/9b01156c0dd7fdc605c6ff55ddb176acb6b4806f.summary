-- one fateful consequence of president @entity3 's ferocious crackdown on @entity5 protesters is the emergence of the domestic armed resistance , the @entity8			1
forged in neighboring @entity9 over the summer by military defectors , the @entity8 has become a major factor in the opposition to the regime			1
the grass - roots armed resistance is growing , attracting civilians as well as military defectors , and has become a thorn in the side of the @entity5 military and the pro-regime militias , observers say			1
but it needs more personnel , better resources and improved coordination to take on the @entity5 security presence , they add			1
" the @entity8 is contributing to the strain on regime forces by requiring them to operate almost continuously and engage in frequent combat , " said @entity28 , a defense fellow at the @entity29			1
" this is in addition to the strain created by hundreds of peaceful civilian demonstrations across the country each week			0
the regime has been compelled to deploy larger forces and conduct more violent operations , increasing both its losses and the international visibility of its actions , " he said			2
" although attrition of regime personnel is not yet numerically significant , the spectacle of burned - out government vehicles and dead soldiers likely rallies the opposition and decreases morale among regime loyalists			2
" @entity28 made remarks in a january 27 essay titled " the @entity8 bleeds the @entity55 , " and elaborated on that analysis in an interview wednesday			1
he said government operations " in recent days have pushed the @entity8 to a lower level of activity			1
" but he also said the regime " has not been able to eradicate the @entity8 in any area			1
" he said the @entity8 has been engaged in combat in at least six of the country 's 14 provinces -- @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71			1
@entity71 includes the @entity73 suburbs			0
the fighters have been " inflicting greater losses on regime personnel and equipment than at any time since its involvement in the uprising began , " @entity28 said			0
he said about 180 clashes were reported between early november and late january			0
one - third occurred in @entity66 province and about a quarter in @entity70 , while clashes have increased in @entity71			0
the group has operated openly in places like @entity66 province and the cities of @entity68 , @entity67 and @entity89 , and it has established control over some small pockets			0
" their most common operations include attacking regime positions ( primarily checkpoints ) , defending demonstrators and local areas , and ambushing regime forces , " @entity28 said			2
rebels say they are not getting weapons and money from outside groups			2
@entity28 said most of the weapons are captured or bought from the @entity5 military			1
some smuggling is reported , he added			0
the rebels are getting better armed , with more and better antitank weapons , and the number of defections is growing , @entity28 said			0
the @entity8 's acquisition of advanced antitank weapons is to date " the most significant arms development , " he said			1
it claims to have used an @entity114 , a rocket - propelled grenade launcher , to destroy an infantry fighting vehicle in @entity70			0
" several videos suggest it has guided antitank missiles as well , " @entity28 said			0
" it seems to have no shortage of small arms and light crew - served weapons , including assault rifles , medium machine guns , standard rocket - propelled grenades , and scoped / sniper rifles			0
the @entity8 also claims to be employing improvised explosive devices against regime vehicles , and videos have corroborated this			1
in addition , it has begun using vehicles for tactical troop movement , equipped with improvised armor and machine guns			0
" there have been a number of cases of soldiers defecting with armored vehicles , he said			0
the @entity8 claimed to have as many as 40,000 personnel			1
@entity28 said 4,000 to 7,000 is a " more reasonable estimate " but there has been a " substantial increase " from november			0
he said the size of group defections is growing , from the five to 20 people to platoon - sized defections of 30 or so people			0
there are 38 named battalions in the @entity8 , some more closely associated with the central command than others , @entity28 said			1
while there is guidance from @entity8 headquarters , there appears to be no day - to - day control			1
@entity28 said @entity8 battalions appear to be fighting alone and have n't yet shown " they can coordinate operations on a regional basis			1
" " essentially these battalions are largely independent operations			0
there 's no substructure underneath the @entity8 command in @entity9 that operates the battalions , " he said			1
" it is unclear to what extent the @entity8 's command in @entity9 exercises real control over operations , other than providing general guidance			1
it is also uncertain how much freedom of action @entity9 allows these commanders			0
this means that @entity8 units are essentially conducting independent actions while the regime conducts coordinated operations			1
" civilians have been joining @entity8 units because of the " synergy " between the resistance group and the populace , he said			1
some civilians are locals who simply link up with battalions and there may be local defense groups forming under the @entity8 banner			1
" some of these groups may have civilians who joined them			0
my sense is that the core , the primary combat forces , are coming from defectors , " he said			0
the group is also working to develop closer relations with the @entity209 , the political opposition			0
while coordinating operations is one challenge for the @entity8 , others are cohesion and military limitations			1
news of a power struggle has emerged in recent days between @entity8 head col. @entity217 and a general , @entity218 , forming a @entity219			2
another group , the @entity220 , said it is operating outside the control of both groups			0
@entity8 lt. col. @entity223 told @entity0 that " many of the officers fighting on the ground have pledged allegiance " to @entity218			2
" they operate from the @entity9 / @entity5 borders at the refugee camps , while we are fighting on the ground and are very organized , " he said			2
@entity28 said any rift would n't help them but it 's not having an effect on combat			0
it would have a greater effect if a world player decided it wanted to funnel money to the fighters			0
@entity244 lawmakers such as sen. @entity245 said @entity246 should consider arming such rebels			0
@entity28 said it would n't surprise him if international clandestine services are feeling out the @entity8 to see " what they are made of , " but there 's no solid evidence of any outside help			2
@entity223 said that despite the @entity8 's efforts " it can not defeat @entity3 's army with the weapons he is using			1
he has escalated his attacks by using helicopters , rocket launchers and mortars			0
" the @entity5 regime is dominated by the @entity265 minority			2
the @entity5 opposition has a large @entity268 component			2
@entity223 said there are concerns that among world powers that arms would fall into the hands of @entity274			0
" the international community is reluctant to donate weapons because the @entity277 is highly represented " in the @entity209			0
while @entity5 militants wait for outside help , @entity223 said the regime has backing from outside entities -- @entity283 's @entity282 and the @entity285 militant group @entity284 in @entity5			1
" we have captured @entity283 fighters from the @entity282 and broadcast the videos showing the weapons they used to refute claims that they were technicians			1
many civilians and eyewitnesses gave testimonials about @entity283 storming into their homes during the searches and arrests along with @entity3 's army recruits			2
" based in @entity302 , on the coast , @entity223 said , he has seen signs of the @entity284 modus operandi			2
" what we know for sure is that the regime is digging trenches around @entity302 coast just the same way they are dug in southern @entity285 , which is controlled by @entity284			2
@entity3 's @entity8 has installed rocket launchers in the mountains of @entity302 and are in a process of setting up a self - sustained region similar to the @entity284 establishment in @entity285 , in order to have a base after @entity3 falls , " @entity223 said			1
@entity317 , visiting fellow with @entity319 chair in strategy at the @entity321 , said that despite some operational and tactical victories in the provinces of @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 and in some @entity73 suburbs , the @entity5 military " continues to control many key checkpoints leading to rebel - held neighborhoods and districts			1
" the @entity8 needs " better organization , leadership , command and control and more military personnel and hardware " to compete with the government 's " security apparatus " and resilient military			1
@entity317 said its manpower is in the low thousands and " there are few indications that the force has been able to establish a clear chain of command			0
" he added that " elements of the armed opposition seem to be operating outside the umbrella of the @entity8 and cities like @entity68 and @entity67 have seen the emergence of home - grown armed groups or militias intent on defending their neighborhoods against the crackdown			2
" while there have been defections , he said , " there seems to have been far more outright desertions than shifts of forces to the @entity8			2
" as for @entity5 military leaders , they back the regime because of fear of reprisals if @entity3 's rule ends and their " deep aversion to prolonged instability			1
" but the prospect of a split in the military could be a good sign for the resistance forces			0
" while the @entity5 military needed time to absorb the shock of mounting internal opposition , it now appears to be on the offensive and it is likely to remain critical to the survival of the @entity3 regime			1
should it experience real divisions in the future , the @entity8 may be able to take advantage , " @entity317 said			2
