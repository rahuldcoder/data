@entity2 shooter @entity0 was an isolated young man with deteriorating mental health and a fascination for mass violence whose problems were not ignored but misunderstood and mistreated , according to a report released friday by a @entity9 state agency			1
the 114 - page report released by the @entity11 of the @entity12 profiled the developmental and educational history of @entity0 , the young man who carried out the mass killings at @entity2 on december 14 , 2012			2
the report noted " missed opportunities " by @entity0 's mother , the school district , and multiple health care providers			1
it identified " warning signs , red flags , or other lessons that could be learned from a review of [ @entity0 's ] life			1
" the authors of the report relied on extensive documentation and interviews with @entity0 's educators and doctors , as well as email exchanges between @entity0 and his parents , to make their determinations and recommendations			1
the report was dedicated to the 20 first - graders who died at @entity2 on december 14 , 2012			2
six educators and the shooter 's mother were also killed in the tragedy that shook the nation to its core and spurred a national debate over gun violence and mental health			1
read the report ( @entity50 ) days before @entity0 had not left his room in his mother 's @entity2 home for three months before the massacre			1
he was anorexic , the report said , and weighed only 112 pounds the day he died , despite being 6 feet tall			0
he kept his room locked and his windows blacked out with plastic garbage bags -- communicating little with the outside world , and with his mother only over email			0
@entity0 did find correspondents virtually , in an online cybercommunity of mass murder enthusiasts			0
in an email dated december 11 , 2012 , three days before his attack , @entity0 wrote to an unnamed chatter : " the inexplicable mystery to me is n't how there are massacres , but rather how there are n't 100,000 of them every year			0
" despite sharing her worries about her son 's condition with friends , the report said it does not appear @entity0 's mother , @entity80 , communicated any concerns to mental health or medical professionals in her final months			1
and while the report determined that @entity0 was not " obviously psychotic " in the time leading up to the shooting , the authors concluded that @entity0 " appears to have been on a path to violence for some time			2
" early development problems the earliest record of @entity0 's budding developmental problems appeared in an early intervention pediatric evaluation just before his 3rd birthday that indicated @entity0 displayed " significantly delayed development of articulation and expressive language skills , " and " fell well below expectations in social - personal development			2
" @entity0 received special education support in preschool , where through age 5 he made up his own language and was reported to at times " sit and hit his head repeatedly , " the report said			2
@entity0 enrolled in @entity2 in the first grade after his family moved to @entity2 , the report said			2
here , he continued to receive treatment for speech articulation problems , though the report showed that his special education classes were slowly phased out as his social interactions with his peers improved			0
" the frequency and duration of services provided should be considered minimal , " the report said , " and likely did not have a significant impact for @entity121 's developmental trajectory			0
" the report concluded that @entity0 's treatment suffered from a continual misguided focus on individual symptomatic intervention -- as with @entity0 's articulation problems -- while " the larger issue of expressive communication received little attention , as did other aspects of his rituals and sensory sensitivity			1
" @entity0 was completely integrated into the regular classroom in fourth grade , and by fifth grade , @entity0 transferred into a new school , the @entity138 for grades five and six			2
it was during this late elementary school period that major mental health red flags were raised , the report said			1
' @entity143 of @entity144 ' @entity0 and an unnamed co-author penned " @entity147 " for a fifth - grade project			0
the spiral - bound comic - book style piece , with a purple cover , was made up of violent stories , according to the report , " filled with images and narrative relating child murder , cannibalism and taxidermy			0
" " ' @entity143 of @entity144 ' can only be described as extremely abhorrent and , if it had been carefully reviewed by school staff , it would have suggested the need for a referral to a child psychiatrist or other mental health professional for evaluation , " the report said			0
warning signs like the book and @entity0 's increasing anxiety were improperly addressed by @entity0 's mother and educators , the report said			1
it noted , however , that " teachers may have limited training or expertise to identify or respond to a student who may be progressing academically but who is also exhibiting difficulties in social emotional development " and urged additional training			0
@entity0 's father : he would have killed me ' in a heartbeat ' denial in a september 2005 visit to the @entity185 for a crisis evaluation , @entity80 described her son to the health care providers as " having had ' borderline autism ' in the past , but having since outgrown it , " the report said			1
after evaluation , the hospital crisis team discussed recommendations for therapeutic support and additional psychiatric evaluation , though @entity80 declined the recommendations , stating that @entity0 " would be ' better off ' at home			0
" " the record seems to indicate that they cared deeply , that they tried , " dr. @entity199 , a @entity200 psychiatrist who co-wrote the report , told reporters in a teleconference , " but it 's not clear that the depth of the issues were recognized and so their response , especially the response of mrs. @entity212 , could appear like denial			0
" the report concluded that a pattern of accommodation to @entity0 's mental health conditions -- rather than addressing his underlying needs -- by @entity80 and certain health care providers , exacerbated @entity0 's mental status			1
the report singled out a period of homebound education during which @entity0 was taken out of school during his eighth - grade year as an especially dangerous health care decision that contributed to his isolation and deterioration			2
" the level of isolation , disconnect and socialization that we know kids enjoy as part of their education becomes totally lost and that 's a piece of what we see in @entity121 's life , " said @entity228 , an assistant child advocate and co-author			0
the report concluded that @entity0 's homebound placement was " inappropriate and nontherapeutic " and recommended a review of homebound status education and asked the state to consider an audit of existing homebound practices			1
when and how do parents educate children about guns ? treatment the report did single out positive health care intervention : " of the couple of providers that saw @entity121 , only one -- the @entity256 -- seemed to appreciate the gravity of @entity121 's presentation , his need for extensive mental health and special education supports , and the critical need for medication to ease his obsessive - compulsive symptoms			0
" calls for medication went unheeded by @entity80 , however , whom the authors described as accommodating to her son 's aversion to medication			0
the report ultimately determines that @entity0 's mental health issues may have extended past autism to include anxiety disorder , obsessive - compulsive disorder and suicidal disorder			1
the report says there is " no connection ... between [ @entity0 's ] developmental profile and an increased likelihood of violent actions			1
" and that his " access to assault weapons with high capacity magazines did play a major role			0
" the report also noted that it appeared @entity80 made no effort to curtail her son 's access to guns in the house in the months leading up to the shooting , despite @entity0 's severe mental deterioration			1
" while we describe the predisposing factors and compounding stresses in [ @entity0 's ] life , we do not conclude that they add up to an inevitable arc leading to mass murder , " the report concluded			1
" in the end , only he , and he alone , bears responsibility for this monstrous act			0
" opinion : i have @entity312 's , i play violent video games -- and i 'm not going to shoot you			0
