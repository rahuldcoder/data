for more than a month , a @entity1 and @entity2 war veteran has been held in a @entity4 , @entity5 , prison , fighting for his release after being charged with a crime he says he did not commit			1
sgt. @entity9 said he accidentally crossed into @entity5 around 10 p.m. on march 31 with three personal firearms while on his way to meet friends in @entity13 , @entity14			1
@entity9 , 25 , had recently moved to the area to get treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder and was " essentially living out of his truck , " his mother , @entity21 , told @entity22			1
he is currently being held in the @entity24 penitentiary in @entity4 on a weapons charge and awaits a may 28 court date , according to the @entity5 attorney general 's office			1
" i accidentally drove into @entity5 with 3 guns ... a rifle ( @entity34 ) , a .45 cal pistol and a 12 gauge pump shotgun with no intensions ( sic ) on being in @entity5 or being involved in any criminal activities , " @entity9 wrote in a statement of innocence to @entity31 rep. @entity30			1
" i have rights to all 3 weapons			0
they are under my name ... please help me			0
" @entity30 , a @entity14 @entity43 , is among several lawmakers who have recently begun petitioning for @entity9 's release			1
last week , @entity30 wrote a letter to secretary of state @entity47 , urging him to get involved			2
also , in a bipartisan congressional letter addressed to @entity5 's attorney general on may 8 , @entity30 wrote : " @entity5 's attorney general is in a position to deal with @entity9 's case and ensure its quick resolution ... it is necessary that the ag intervene and expedite proceedings at the very least			1
and so far there 's been no validation from @entity5 that @entity9 did n't make a directional mistake at the border			1
" the @entity5 attorney general 's office confirmed @entity9 's arrest on a weapons charge but could not offer more details about his case			1
if i can have my baby home on sunday , that would be the greatest gift a mother could ever ask for , " @entity67 said in an interview from @entity69			0

" he was willing to die for his country as a @entity1			0
where is his country now when he needs it the most ? " it is difficult for the @entity85 to quantify how many arrests are due to accidental crossings at the @entity31 - @entity5 border , a spokeswoman told @entity22 , but @entity9 's case is not all that unique			1

" the press coverage led to his release , " @entity104 said in a phone interview			0
" it 's an illegitimate ( court ) process ( in @entity5 )			2
there 's no oral arguments			0
you 're guilty until you 're proven innocent			0
unfortunately , the only way to deal with that is ... if the ( @entity31 ) @entity85 is not going to do something about it , then you have to go to the public and force them to do something about it			2
in our case , that 's what moved things along			0
" in a daily press briefing this week , @entity22 asked @entity85 spokeswoman @entity126 about @entity9 's case , but she declined to comment , citing " privacy concerns			1
" meanwhile , @entity9 's family is determined to secure his release			2
