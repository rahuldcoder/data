while president @entity1 held a news conference on thursday where he announced an administrative fix to the @entity5 , it quickly digressed into a confession and apology hour			1
he called the rollout of @entity5 " rough			1
" he said he " fumbled			0
" he said the problems are " on me			0
" he also offered an olive branch to his colleagues on @entity13 and acknowledged his party 's tough circumstances			0
" there is no doubt that our failure to roll out the @entity5 smoothly has put a burden on @entity21 , whether they 're running or not , because they stood up and supported this , " @entity1 said			1
can @entity24 really save insurance plans lost under @entity5 ? " i feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them , rather than easier for them , " he added			1
it 's tough to be a @entity30 now less than a month after the government shutdown during which the @entity32 seemed doomed for a generation -- or at least through 2014 -- the @entity21 are now nervously tapping wondering what went so miserably wrong			1
the botched @entity5 rollout has put political pressure on the @entity21 as members backed the @entity1 health care agenda as he said on thursday " through thick and thin			1
" @entity1 's self - deprecating confession , combined with his administrative " fix " to allow people in the individual market to keep their current insurance plans , did not , however , completely alleviate concerns of @entity21 lawmakers			1
@entity1 unveiled remedies for people whose insurance plans have been canceled , despite repeated assurances that if you like your plan you can keep it			1
he said the federal government " is n't going to get in the way " of insurance companies offering plans to existing customers in the individual insurance market that do n't meet minimum coverage requirements			0
frayed nerves for instance , senator @entity60 , @entity61 , said she is still going to push her legislation that would also address the problem			0
and senator @entity65 , @entity67 - @entity66 , told @entity68 she is inclined to support @entity60 's bill			0
it goes a little bit further and has more teeth			0
@entity5 rattling @entity21 nerves both @entity60 and @entity65 are up for re-election next year			1
a handful of other @entity21 senators have to tread carefully as do dozens of @entity21 @entity79 members			1
the president 's announcement came as @entity21 repeatedly rang alarm bells over the canceled plans			2
former president @entity84 chimed in , saying @entity1 should keep his promise			2
some @entity21 say it does n't go far enough because the onus is on insurance companies and state insurance commissioners to extend the plans for an additional year			2
the insurance trade lobby , @entity91 , released a statement saying the last - minute changes could " destabilize the market and result in higher premiums			0
" many in @entity24 avoiding @entity5 exchange insurance cancellations exist on top of a troubled website and lower - than - expected enrollment figures			1
the real test on whether @entity1 alleviated @entity21 concerns will be if @entity21 back a @entity32 proposal friday by rep. @entity105 of @entity106 that would largely undermine @entity5			1
@entity105 's bill would allow affected insurance plans to extend into next year and gut a major part of the @entity5 by allowing anyone -- not just the 5 % of people in the individual market place - to purchase low - coverage plans			2
@entity5 prohibits discrimination for preexisting conditions and mandates coverage for mental health , prenatal care and other issues			2
this is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage			0
trust with the problems facing @entity5 , public opinion of the president has declined			2
his approval rating among @entity129 voters has dropped to its lowest number in a @entity132 polling since he became president with new doubts being raised about trust			0
fifty two percent of respondents said the president is not trustworthy			0
@entity1 appeared to understand the severity			0
" i am not a perfect man and i will not be a perfect president , but i 'll wake up every single day working as hard as i can on behalf of @entity129 out there , " he said			0
@entity5 promises : where things stand @entity68 chief political correspondent @entity144 said @entity1 's diminished trustworthiness will make the remaining implementation of @entity5 challenging			1
" it 's going to be more and more difficult every day , " @entity144 said .			0

@entity1 says he feels " deeply responsible " for political *fallout* *democrats* face
