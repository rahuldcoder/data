-- @entity1 has stood before five juries in the past 13 years on capital murder charges , accused of killing four people in a @entity6 furniture store			1
now , prosecutors are hoping his sixth trial will be the last			0
@entity1 , 40 , is believed to be the only person in recent @entity11 history to be tried six times on the same capital murder charges			1
his trial began last week in @entity16 @entity15 in downtown @entity17 , just a few blocks from the furniture store where four people were shot to death nearly 14 years ago			1
@entity22 , the owner of @entity22 's furniture , and three employees were shot execution - style in the head the morning of july 16 , 1996 , inside the store , court records say			2
the shootings rattled the sleepy central @entity6 town , with a population of about 5,500 that has declined in the 14 years since then			0
like most of the businesses still operating in downtown @entity17 , @entity22 's was a relic of another era , having opened its doors in the 1940s			0
@entity22 and her husband were prominent members of the community , and nearly everyone in @entity17 could claim some connection to the victims			0
after months of interviews and a $ 30,000 reward for information , @entity1 was arrested in january 1997 on four counts of capital murder			1
he has been in custody ever since			0
@entity1 has been convicted three times and sentenced to death twice , but the @entity53 reversed those verdicts and ordered a new trial each time			1
his two most recent trials ended in hung juries , leading his supporters to question why the @entity16 district attorney 's office continues to seek a conviction			1
the prosecution 's case is based largely on circumstantial evidence			2
there is no dna , the alleged murder weapon has not been found and eyewitnesses who say they saw @entity68 the day of the shooting have provided conflicting accounts			2
still , @entity16 district attorney @entity71 says it 's a straightforward case of a disgruntled worker taking out his anger against his former employer			1
others , who believe @entity1 is innocent , say the case has turned into a crusade and suggest that race has played a major role in the prosecution and convictions of @entity1			1
" the fact they 're trying this case for the sixth time suggests to me there 's some racial motivation here , because there 's no way in the world i can see a white guy accused of doing the same thing being tried six times to procure a conviction , " said @entity84 councilman @entity83 , who represented flowers in his second trial in 1999			1
@entity68 ' supporters say it is a classic example of a case built upon weak circumstantial evidence and shaky eyewitness testimony intended to blame an easy target : a poor black man			2
" what does it say about the prosecution that they have chosen to ignore two jury verdicts ? " said @entity108 , executive director of @entity109 , a nonprofit organization that monitors due process violations in the criminal justice system			1
" i really think the only way to save @entity17 from this nightmare is to force the @entity16 district attorney to step aside and appoint the attorney general 's office			1
if you did that , i am convinced you would n't see the prosecution of @entity1 , because the evidence just is n't there			1
" to @entity71 , though , @entity1 ' prosecution is about seeking justice for the victims and bringing closure to the community			1
" any time that we feel there is evidence to prove a case , we 're going to pursue it , " said @entity71 , who tried the five previous cases and will lead the prosecution this time			2
@entity71 declined to elaborate on lessons learned from the previous trials or to say if his strategy will be different this time around , but he said the two hung juries did not affect his decision to try @entity1 again			1
" any case that 's on the docket i want to try and dispose of it , " he said			0
@entity71 and @entity1 ' current lawyer , @entity149 , said they expected much of the evidence to be the same this go - round as it has been in previous trials			1
in all five trials , @entity155 , an employee of @entity22 's since it opened in 1942 , testified that @entity22 called him around 9 a.m. on july 16 about coming in to train two new employees			2
when @entity155 arrived at the store around 9:30 a.m. , he discovered the bodies of @entity22 , bookkeeper @entity161 and @entity162 lying near the counter in pools of blood			0
nearby , @entity155 saw 16 - year - old @entity166 on the floor , blood pouring from his head with each labored breath			0
he died a week later			0
prosecutors allege that @entity1 , a former employee , stole a gun from his uncle 's car and shot @entity22 because she had fired him two weeks before the killings and docked his pay for damaging a pair of batteries			1
he allegedly shot the others to eliminate witnesses , and then took money from the cash register , which elevated the offense to capital murder and made him eligible for the death penalty			0
the .380 - caliber pistol used in the shootings has not been found , but investigators matched bullets at the scene to shell casings from the gun owned by @entity1 ' uncle , which has also not been recovered			1
another witness who came forward months after the shooting and said she saw @entity68 " leaning " on his uncle 's car around 7:15 a.m. the day of shootings			2
the same day , his uncle , @entity200 , reported that a gun had been stolen from his car			0
a neighbor said she saw flowers around 7:30 a.m. outside his home wearing @entity208 sneakers			2
another witness testified that he saw two men standing across the street from @entity22 's around 10 a.m. , and that one of them was @entity1			1
another woman said she saw @entity1 running out of the store the morning of the shootings while she was driving toward the store with a friend			2
a trace analyst expert determined that a bloody footprint at the scene came from a size 10.5 @entity223 sneaker ; investigators found a shoebox for a 10.5 @entity226 at the home where @entity1 lived with his girlfriend , but found no sneakers			2
the three different teams of lawyers to represent flowers have argued that witnesses who said they saw him that morning came forward with shaky stories months after the shootings , enticed by a $ 30,000 reward			0
they also said prosecutors failed to conclusively link flowers to the weapon or the crime scene through the bloody footprint , and questioned whether the evidence proved that money was taken from the cash register			2
" the reward offer really poisoned the case by giving rise to fabricated eyewitness testimony , " said defense lawyer @entity83			0
" i do n't think the witnesses recognized the consequences of what they were doing , that they were going to help put this man to death			0
" in @entity1 ' second through fifth trials , the defense called witnesses to dispute eyewitness accounts of the woman who said she saw @entity68 running out of the store			1
prosecutors at first attempted to try @entity68 separately for each murder , but the first two convictions were reversed after the @entity53 found that evidence of the other deaths was improperly introduced			1
the court found that prosecutors used excessive displays of crime scene photos and testimony regarding the nature of the other deaths			0
" by using this tactic or trial strategy , the state improperly prejudiced the jury and denied @entity68 his fundamental right to a fair trial , " the justices wrote in two nearly identical opinions issued in 2000 and 2003			0
the third trial in 2004 also ended in a conviction that was later reversed after the state @entity53 ruled that prosecutors dismissed black jurors based on race , fueling allegations of racial bias against the district attorney 's office			1
in the case of one black female whom the prosecution voted to dismiss because of her attitude toward the death penalty , the court noted that her views " were nearly indistinguishable from those of two white jurors who ultimately served on the jury , suggesting disparate treatment			0
" the next two trials -- flowers 4 and 5 , as they are called by the lawyers who tried them -- ended in hung juries after the panelists failed to reach a unanimous decision			1
the first jury was split along racial lines , with five black jurors voting to acquit and seven white jurors choosing to convict			1
the lone black juror on the panel in the fifth trial , who voted to acquit @entity1 , was charged with perjury , but the charges were ultimately dismissed			2
@entity68 ' supporters say the first three convictions and the racial divides in the last two trials can be attributed to the racist attitudes that still prevail in @entity6 , especially when a low - income black person is accused of killing a prominent white member of the community			1
@entity22 and two of the other victims were white ; the fourth victim was black			0
" i 'm not accusing white jurors of overt racial prejudice -- maybe some racial insensitivity -- but i think the real problem is they do n't have enough social knowledge to evaluate the credibility of testimony and i think black jurors do , and that 's what disturbs me about this tendency to eliminate black jurors and to disregard the black jurors ' verdicts , " said @entity108			0
there will be a few differences in the sixth trial			0
among them , the absence of two jailhouse informants from @entity68 1 , who testified that the defendant admitted to the shootings			0
the two later admitted to lying under promises of monetary reward from law enforcement , according to @entity83			0
another difference involves the testimony of @entity349 , the man who said he saw flowers across the street from the store around 10 a.m. with another man			0
it will be read to the jury , because @entity349 is dead			0
@entity108 , who plans to observe the trial , said he is especially looking forward to the jury selection phase , in which prospective jurors are questioned on their beliefs			1
" the racial dynamics are right there on the surface			0
there 's no pretense of equal justice , so i 'm hoping this story can be instructive in that regard , whatever the outcome may be			0
