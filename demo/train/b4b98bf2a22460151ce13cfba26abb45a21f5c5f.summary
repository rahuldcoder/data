@entity0 -- republicans are taking aim at @entity5 's oldest senior citizens group , @entity4 , in the wake of a @entity2 - authored report that they contend exposed " the conflict between @entity4 's drive for profits , the best interests of its members and the organization 's tax - exempt status			1
" @entity16 counter that the attacks are based on the organization 's support of president @entity21 's health care reform bill			1
" the facts suggest that @entity4 has strayed from its core mission , " rep. @entity22 , @entity23 , chairman of the @entity25 ' health subcommittee , said at a hearing friday			1
he was one of those who released the report , titled " @entity31 : the @entity32 does n't know , " this week			0
" the facts show that @entity4 no longer operates like a seniors advocacy organization			1
instead it more closely resembles a for - profit insurance company , " he said			0
@entity22 's subcommittee is now challenging @entity4 's tax - exempt nonprofit status , looking into how the @entity4 does business and pointing to the organization 's profits from the sale of insurance and other products			1
the organization made nearly a third of its $ 1.4 billion budget through insurance sales in 2009 , @entity46 's @entity45 told the panel friday			2
rep. @entity52 , @entity53 , also argued friday that the @entity4 has strayed from its original mission of protecting seniors			2
" contributions to the @entity57 between 2002 and 2009 grew by only 11 % , or about $ 3.1 million			0
and funding of the legal counsel for the elderly actually decreased by about 9 % , " @entity52 said			0
" the parts of @entity4 that fulfill its original purpose seem not to be sharing in the bounty that has come to @entity4 from its insurance - related business activities			2
" @entity16 counter by pointing out that @entity2 welcomed @entity4 's 2003 support of the @entity2 push for @entity68 reform , saying there were no such questions or hearings back then			1
some members called the hearing " political payback " for @entity4 's support of @entity21 's health care reform efforts			1
" we should see this for what it is , " said rep. @entity77 , @entity78 , " a waste of government time , and a vindictive attempt to settle a political score			0
" the hearing " amounts to nothing more than a political witch hunt to punish an organization that spoke out in favor of health reform , " he said , adding that the @entity2 aim is " to discredit @entity4 in the minds of seniors			1
" " before they announce a budget that will devastate @entity68 , @entity98 , @entity99 , they would like to silence @entity4 , " @entity77 said			0
@entity100 , @entity4 's ceo , told committee members that the organization has been nothing but transparent , in contrast to the " @entity107 " report 's implication that the organization had an ulterior motive for supporting health care reform			1
the report concluded that the @entity4 stands " to make upwards of $ 1 billion over the next 10 years as a result of the new health care law through the sale of their endorsed - @entity68 insurance products , " according to a news release from @entity22 this week announcing the release of the report			1
" we post on our website our annual reports , financial statements , @entity125 form 990 tax returns and detailed breakdowns of our revenues and expenditures , " @entity100 said			0
" this is why we are surprised and disappointed both by the title and substance of the report			0
" he said there is no veil and the organization disagrees with all of the conclusions reached in the " one - sided report			0
" " first , we reject the allegation that our public policy positions are influenced by our revenues			0
our policy positions are set by our all - volunteer board of directors based on the needs of our 50 - plus population , " he added			0
and rep. @entity147 , @entity148 , noted that " the sixth - largest social welfare organization " with the type of nonprofit classification @entity4 has " is a tax - exempt race track and casino which operates in @entity151			1
" " i 'm sure you 'll help me understand why a race track and a casino are more deserving of this classification , because that 's what you 're getting at , " he said			0
former @entity2 rep. @entity160 , once the chairman of the @entity161 , admits that attacking the @entity4 is risky			2
" a perceived attack on @entity4 could easily backfire , giving @entity16 an opportunity they could quickly use to paint themselves as the party best positioned to protect seniors in the future , " he wrote in a @entity163 opinion piece			2
" at the end of the day , i suspect @entity4 is likely to meet any reasonable test for non-profit status , " he added			2
" after all , it has no stock , pays no dividends and uses the profits it makes from sales and licensing to fund tax - exempt programs which assist seniors			1
" @entity1 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
