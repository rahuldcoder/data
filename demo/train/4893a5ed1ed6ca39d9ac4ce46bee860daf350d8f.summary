-- actress , writer and director @entity1 talks to @entity0 's @entity4 about infertility , her new book and reprising the blockbuster role that made her famous			1
@entity0 : ok , full disclosure , we 're friends			1
i 've been to your house for @entity14			1
your book is called " @entity17 , " so i 'm assuming it 's about how you 'd like to adopt me			1
on the off chance it 's not , please tell me what it 's about and why you decided to write it			2
vardalos : true , we are one slumber party away from being bffs			2
and it 's all thanks to the virtual wine bar where nice people now connect : @entity31			2
ok , back to me			2
i wanted to write about the tenaciously stubborn quest for happiness i believe lies within all of us			2
plus i 'm trying to blow the lid off the silent failure women feel about infertility			1
for years , i was ashamed , then via foster care found my daughter ... when she was almost 3 years old			1
i did n't adopt a baby			1
@entity0 : people feel like they know you by way of " @entity46 " -- because that was a personal film in many ways -- but this book is actually much more personal , much more emotional			1
was it tough to write ? because you 're actually a very private person			2
vardalos : i am nauseous from the acid reflux i 'm having because i am going public in this book			1
sure , i enjoy making fun of my family for fun and profit , but to reveal vulnerable truths like this is completely unlike me			2
however , i have a nagging feeling that the success of " @entity46 " happened because i 'm supposed to be using my big mouth to talk about adoption			1
@entity0 : you 're primarily identified with comedies			2
was it difficult to write about the incident when you were the victim of a crime ? vardalos : terrifying			2
when i finished that chapter , i debated keeping it in because , well , now people will know			2
and although i describe it in what was , for me , excruciating detail , i eventually found the humor in the experience when i was writing about it because of the human idiocy i encountered after the incident			2
anyway , it may be a mistake , but i kept it in			2
then i told my mom			0
@entity1 stays ' in the moment ' @entity0 : what have you learned from your own mom ? and , for that matter , what have you learned from @entity91 , who played your mother in " @entity46 " ? vardalos : my mom taught me to always conduct yourself as if a video camera is on you at all times			1
@entity91 taught me to never sleep with my co-stars			0
@entity0 : let 's talk about the title , " @entity17			1
" be honest , did your publisher want to call it " @entity102 fill - in - the - blank - with - something - about - parenting " ? vardalos : here 's a humblebrag : there were about 10 offers for this autobiography , and several wanted to call it " @entity111			0
" which is why i went with @entity113			0
@entity0 : what 's that " instant " transformation like ? one minute it 's game night with @entity118 and @entity119 , and the next minute you have a daughter in preschool , right ? vardalos : yep , one evening i 'm waving on a red carpet whilst sucking in my gut , and the next day i was waving goodbye to my daughter as she walked into preschool , whilst sucking back my snot - bawling and wiping her spilled apple juice out of my @entity131 purse			1
@entity0 : adoption advocacy , particularly adoption for children in foster care , is something you 've been vocal about since long before you wrote this book			1
do you feel like you 're making progress ? vardalos : no. that 's why i wrote this book			1
i wanted to write about these kids and the compassionate work these social workers and adoption attorneys do to place them in permanent homes			1
i call them super-pretty angels			0
there is a how - to - adopt appendix , fully vetted by a social worker			0
this is the book i wished was out there when i was searching for credible information on how to adopt. @entity0 : but it 's not just a book about adoption			1
it 's actually not even a mom book			1
i think it 's for everyone			0
vardalos : oh , you 're good			0
@entity0 : @entity167 , who , like you , is very funny and very smart , said your book made her laugh and cry , which is kind of the highest of compliments , rights ? vardalos : it is			1
i wrote this book in the same way i wrote " @entity46 " : i simply sat alone and poured my guts out into a computer keyboard , not caring how it would be received , not letting my mind wander into worrying what people would think of me			1
i did n't show it to anyone until it was printed , so it would be too late to make changes			1
i wanted to write unfettered by critique and concern on how it would be received or what it would do to my image			0
it 's the most honest i 've ever been , and yes , i 'm petrified			0
but i write in the prologue that if something scares me , i tend to lean into it			0
i 'm more of a fearless idiot			0
@entity0 : your husband , @entity199 ( who stars in @entity202 's " @entity201 " ) , cooks a nice chicken dinner ; you cook really good lasagna			0
whose food does your daughter prefer ? vardalos : her grandmother 's			0
@entity0 : how did parenthood change your @entity213 life ? less clubbing , i assume			0
vardalos : no , you 've been over for dinner			0
you see we still snort poppers after dessert			0
@entity0 : my @entity222 grandmother will yell at me if i do n't ask you about the chances of a sequel to " @entity46			1
" i know you 've got a book tour to focus on , but at least give me something to tell her on our weekly phone call			1
vardalos : tell her hi from me , and yes , i have been approached to the write the sequel			0
i am finally coming around to the idea of doing it because ( co-star ) @entity236 and i hung out recently , singing and playing guitars until 3 a.m. in that moment of clarity that only comes with too much wine and the haze of approaching dawn , i suddenly visualized where @entity244 and @entity199 end up			0
i saw their world very clearly			0
@entity249 and @entity199 's life is very similar to the easy and solid friendship i felt with @entity236 that night			0
@entity0 : this has been fun			0
let 's go ask your husband to cook us some chicken			0
vardalos : he said he will in the morning , but for now we have to shut up and put the dogs out			0
" @entity17 " by @entity1 will be released by @entity113 on april 2 .			1
