-- a moon circling @entity2 has sent up a small flare			0
it may be telling astronomers that life could be supported there , and it may offer a way of finding out			1
the scientists have recognized a puff of water vapor sprouting 125 miles high above @entity13 in a special image captured by the @entity15 , @entity9 said thursday			1
" we pushed @entity15 to its limits to see this very faint emission , " said @entity16 , the telescope 's lead investigator on the project			1
they 're not quite sure yet , but @entity16 , a professor at the @entity23 in @entity24 , believes that a geyser on @entity13 's south pole blustered the vapor up from a water source under the moon 's surface			1
aquatic life many scientists feel certain that a deep ocean lies beneath the icy , miles - thick shell that covers the moon , the @entity32 said			1
the whole celestial body looks like a white , scratchy ball of ice			2
@entity13 , which is too far away from the sun to enjoy the warmth of its golden rays , has surface temperatures as low as -328 degrees @entity45 , the @entity32 said			2
it 's hardly a temperature anything living could survive at			0
but the moon is probably heated from within			0
friction caused by @entity2 's gravitational pull on its core keeps the internal ocean from freezing , scientists believe			1
its water might have the right chemistry to sustain some very basic aquatic life			1
and this newly recognized vapor trail may offer an easier way of finding that out , astronomer @entity59 told @entity9			2
he analyzed the data @entity15 collected			1
" if those plumes are connected with the subsurface water ocean we are confident exists under @entity13 's crust , then this means that future investigations can directly investigate the chemical makeup of @entity13 's potentially habitable environment without drilling through layers of ice			1
and that is tremendously exciting			0
" a cheaper flight instead of having to land there with heavy borer rigs loaded onto a large , expensive spacecraft to collect a water sample , a probe could now just fly into the vapor , suck some of it in and analyze it			1
money is important , when it comes to studying @entity13			0
most of what astronomers know about it comes from data picked up by the @entity93 mission to @entity2 , which ended in 2003 and was plagued with funding blackouts , the @entity32 said			2
@entity9 's @entity95 has been trying to come up with lower - budget experiments to make funding for a mission more likely , according to the @entity32			0
they would involve an orbiter to observe the surface long - term and a spacecraft that would fly there to take radar images of what 's underneath the ice			1
now , there may be another , even more enticing and equally thrifty experiment to add to the list			0
need more pics but before all that can happen , @entity15 needs to snap few more images of the plumes to confirm the discovery			1
and even then , it may take @entity117 and his colleagues a while to feel comfortable with their analysis of the spectrographic images that discern light waves from @entity13			0
the vapor is not visible to the naked eye			0
@entity15 was able to detect it only because electrons crashed into it , converting it into hydrogen and oxygen molecules			2
thursday 's announcement was based on images recorded in december of last year , @entity9 said			0
it took that long to be reasonably sure that the clouds were n't caused by something else , like charged particles flying there through @entity2 's magnetic field or a meteor crashing down			0
dolphins ? nah if a mission to @entity13 gets launched , do n't expect it to turn up a dolphin			0
because of the extreme conditions in that ocean -- if it exists -- scientists would probably find -- if anything -- the kind of microbes that live under @entity147 's arctic caps or near undersea volcanoes , the @entity32 said			2
this is n't the first time scientists have found water vapor coming from another planet 's moon			1
a @entity9 orbiter has detected similar spouts on one of @entity160 's moons , @entity161 , @entity9 said			0
but this is a sensational find , if it is confirmed			0
it may represent the closest place to @entity147 where scientists could find still - existing life outside of our planet .			2

scientists strongly believe there is an ocean hidden under the ice surface of *europa*
the @entity15 captured a spectrographic image showing water vapor
astronomers believe it came from a geyser connected to the hidden ocean
the vapor could make it possible for a space probe to analyze the water for signs of life
