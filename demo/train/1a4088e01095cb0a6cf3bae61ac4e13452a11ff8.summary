" @entity0 , " the new feature film about the civil rights struggle , is igniting a struggle of its own over who deserves credit -- or blame -- in the events of 50 years ago that are depicted in the movie			1
some have taken issue with the portrayal of president @entity14			2
former @entity14 administration officials are crying foul , saying that the portrayal of @entity14 distorts and tarnishes the record of a man who had become an ally in the fight , committed to the goal and focused on how best to achieve the goal -- given the role of @entity25 and outside forces			2
@entity14 's legacy has long been overshadowed by the quagmire of the @entity29 , and his supporters hope to burnish the image of his presidency by highlighting his efforts in passing the @entity34 and the @entity35			2
it 's the struggle for the latter that is portrayed in " @entity0			1
" but the movie shows @entity14 as worried that the fight for voting rights will endanger the chances of success for other items on his @entity45 agenda , and he pressures the rev. @entity48 to wait			1
when @entity48 is adamant , the film implies that @entity14 even allows @entity51 's @entity50 to pressure the civil rights leader by sending his wife , @entity54 , supposed audio recordings of @entity48 having sex with another woman			2
even before the movie was in wide release , @entity61 director @entity60 , writing in @entity62 , said , " ' @entity0 's ' obstructionist @entity14 is devoid of any palpable conviction on voting rights			1
@entity65 and power hungry , he unleashes his zealous pit bull , @entity50 chief @entity51 , on @entity48			2
" @entity60 claims the movie " flies in the face of history			1
" writing in the @entity73 , @entity71 , one of @entity14 's top aides , accuses the movie of using " dramatic , trumped - up license			1
" " in fact , " he adds , " @entity0 was @entity14 's idea , he considered the @entity35 his greatest legislative achievement , he viewed @entity48 as an essential partner in getting it enacted -- and he did n't use the @entity50 to disparage him			1
" " @entity0 " director @entity82 responded to the criticism on @entity84 , posting that the " notion that @entity0 was @entity14 's idea is jaw dropping and offensive to @entity88 , @entity89 and black citizens who made it so " ( in a reference to the civil rights organizations @entity88 and @entity48 's @entity89			1
) in a subsequent tweet she told people not to take anyone 's word for it , but that " bottom line is folks should interrogate history			2
" of course , once you start interrogating history , you rarely get simple answers			2
the actions and motivations of real people in real historical events are complicated and ambiguous			1
once you take those real people and events and put them into a movie -- even one that strives for historic accuracy -- you add even more complications and ambiguity			1
it 's not possible to re-create , or even agree on , exactly what happened in the past			2
if those who forget the past are condemned to relive it , it seems that those who re-enact the past are condemned to revise it			2
@entity126 : the real story behind ' @entity0 ' @entity14 may be portrayed as flawed , but he 's certainly not the villain of the movie -- @entity130 in 1965 had villains aplenty			1
@entity14 is shown as a man with ambitious goals and strong - arm methods , and a cold pragmatism when it came to deciding what could be done when			0
it could be argued that -- like @entity48 -- @entity14 is keeping his " eyes on the prize , " and he 's not concerned if he tramples a few toes while he 's transfixed with the goal			0
he 's a politician , not a saint , and he concentrates more on what 's most doable than what 's most noble			0
he 's not above using the n - word in a private conversation with @entity130 gov. @entity149 , but he uses it while trying to get @entity149 to offer protection to @entity48 's marchers			0
@entity14 may ultimately be on the side of the angels , but he 's willing to use devilry to achieve his goals			0
like any great movie character -- or real human being -- he is complicated and multifaceted			1
in one of the scenes that has caused the most controversy , when @entity48 is urging a reluctant @entity14 at the @entity163 , they do it in front of a portrait of @entity167 -- a subtle reminder of how long we have been discussing race in @entity171			1
if the @entity14 of " @entity0 " is shown as imperfect , he 's not alone			1
the leaders in the many factions of the civil rights movement are shown as fractious , jealous of their prerogatives and at times petty			0
even @entity48 's shortcomings are on display , as it 's implied that the accusations of infidelities against him may be true			0
at one point , @entity48 , doubtful about his next move , is shown calling up gospel singer @entity183 for inspiration			1
@entity185 was a strong supporter of the movement			0
in fact , @entity48 had called her to come down to @entity130 during the @entity189			0
the very fact that we are dealing with real human beings and not abstractions is what makes their struggle seem even more impressive			0
@entity196 : the miracle of @entity0 " @entity0 " is a movie , not a documentary			1
it neither claims nor tries to give a 100 % accurate telling of the story -- or the events that led to this seminal moment in the civil rights struggles in the 1960s			0
director @entity82 was even forced to rewrite the speeches of @entity48 used in the movie as loose paraphrases because his estate licensed his speeches to another studio for a different movie			1
as in any work of art , in this movie choices have to be made in what to portray and in how to portray it			1
the goal of art is to arrive at fundamental truths that do not rely on the details of incidents being portrayed for their relevance			0
and if a work of art is successful in that , it will illuminate the events in ways that transcend the time and place being portrayed , and transcend the time and place of the work of art itself			0
one of the choices made in the making of " @entity0 " is to keep the focus on the marchers and the people who were putting their lives and safety on the line			1
part of that focus may be because the director is an @entity244 - @entity171 woman			0
she may be trying to avoid the often annoying tendency of movies dealing with important events in african - american history to concentrate on white protagonists			0
films such as " glory " and " @entity252 " sometimes treat the african - americans whose stories are being told like they are passive agents in a narrative that depends on a white hero riding in to save the day , presumably on a white horse			0
the portrayals in " @entity0 " should n't be seen as a dismissal of @entity14 's contributions to the fight civil rights , but as an affirmation of the struggles of the people who were in the middle of that fight , and who had vowed not to fight back with violence			1
it 's a case of keeping your eyes not only on the prize , but on the proper protagonists			0
something else that may be at work here is that we are currently embroiled in another clash in the long , long struggle for equal rights with the ongoing protests over treatment of african - americans under the justice system			0
it 's impossible to see the images of peaceful protesters being brutally attacked on the bridge in " @entity0 " without being reminded of the images of @entity291 being dragged to the ground in a chokehold			1
but both the protests today and the events depicted in the movie show that we need commitment and cooperation from good - hearted people of all races and creeds			2
at the end of the movie , viewers are updated on the subsequent fates of the people portrayed in the film , many of which we know all too well			2
i just wish that they had given an update on the fate of the @entity35			0
that postscript would have to say something like " the @entity35 led a successful and productive life until 2013 when key provisions in it were struck down by the @entity321			0
it is currently on life support			0
" that would alert viewers to the need to continue the fight			0
is " @entity0 " a note - perfect recreation of everything that happened regarding the struggles in passing the @entity35 ? no , because it 's not meant to be			1
it 's meant to be something much more , and at that it succeeds			0
after watching the movie " @entity0 , " i ca n't say i was at @entity0			1
and i ca n't say i know what it must have felt like to be there			2
but i experienced a visceral reaction to a depiction of those events that inspired me , that motivated me ... and that made me want to march on as we continue the struggle for universal suffrage .			0

@entity344 : " @entity0 " has *stirred* a controversy over its historical accuracy
she says critics miss the point ; movie is n't a documentary , but it has a powerful *message*
