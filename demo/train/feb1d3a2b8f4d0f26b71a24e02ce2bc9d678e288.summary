nine @entity3 commanders lost their jobs in the wake of a cheating scandal involving systemic cheating on tests by officers in the @entity11 nuclear missile program , officials from that military branch said thursday			1
the fired officers were in " leadership positions " at @entity15 in @entity16 , air force secretary @entity12 said			2
though not directly involved in cheating , " they failed to provide adequate oversight of their crew force , " according to @entity21			1
in addition , col. @entity26 -- head of the @entity27 and a 25 - year veteran -- " relinquished command " and submitted his resignation thursday morning , said lt. gen. @entity22 , the commander of the @entity3 's @entity23			1
" @entity34 's focus on perfection led commanders to micromanage their people , " said @entity22 , pointing to pressure to get 100 % scores on monthly proficiency exams when only 90 % was necessary to pass			1
" ... leaders lost sight of the fact that execution in the field is more important than what happens in the classroom			2
" @entity21 said thursday that 100 lower - level officers were at one point implicated in the ordeal -- having either been accused directly of cheating or having looked the other way			1
nine of those have been cleared and will be allowed to return to duty , while others could face punishments ranging from letters of counseling to courts - martial on various charges			0
these disciplinary measures are only part of the response , however			0
@entity21 and @entity22 both referred to a number of changes to address this incident as well as far - reaching issues with morale , micromanagement and more among those in the @entity3 's intercontinental ballistic missile program			1
" the issues that we have before us today are tough , and they did n't come overnight , " said @entity21			2
" ... while we have progress in certain areas in recent years , there is more work to be done			0
" military investigators stumbled into the cheating scandal while looking into alleged drug activity involving airmen			2
three of their targets in the drug probe happened to work as missile crew members at @entity15 , which is how investigators got access to their cell phones -- and " found test material on them , " according to @entity22			2
authorities previously said the cheating took place last august and september at the @entity16 base , with officers using texts and pictures to cheat on their proficiency exams			1
but @entity22 said thursday that such behavior actually went well beyond that , having occurred as far back as november 2011 and as recently as november 2013			1
the whole @entity15 scheme centered on four individuals , three of whom were being investigated in the drug probe , according to @entity22			0
" if we would have removed those , then this incident probably would never have happened , " he added			0
about 190 officers oversee the readiness of nuclear weapons systems at the @entity16 base , meaning the episode tainted a large percentage of that force in some way			2
@entity21 said she found worrisome not just that airmen cheated directly , but that no one -- whether or not they were directly involved -- spoke up			0
the @entity3 officials said investigators did n't find any indication of similar cheating on other bases tied to the missile program , though they pointed to common issues elsewhere when it comes to the program 's management			1
to that end , @entity22 said he has a list of " 400 action items " to possible address those issues			0
some are simple , like grading the monthly proficiency on a simple pass / fail metric			0
others are more complicated , though all have a common aim of ensuring the nuclear weapons program is run smartly and effectively by satisfied , capable military personnel with high integrity			0
" our nation demands and deserves the higher standards of accountability from the force entrusted with the most powerful weapon on the planet , " @entity22 said			0
" we are committed to living up to those standards			0
" @entity146 responds to allegations @entity3 cheating scandal			1

the head of the @entity27 " relinquished command , " asked to retire
" @entity34 's focus on perfection led commanders to micromanage , " official says
the cheating on an exam for missile launch officers was between 2011 and 2013
@entity3 leader : though they did n't cheat , commanders did n't provide adequate oversight
