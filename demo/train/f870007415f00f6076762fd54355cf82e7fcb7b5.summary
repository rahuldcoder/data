" this was a great honor , and i felt that i could bring some leadership , vision and intelligence expertise to that position , " he said in a statement			0
" ultimately , my goal was to improve the security of our nation 's transportation systems			2
however , i feel that the distractions caused by my work as a defense contractor would not be good for this administration nor for the @entity22			1
" the @entity4 is part of the @entity22			1
@entity25 spokesman @entity24 noted that @entity1 has more than 35 years of military and intelligence experience , and added , " the president is disappointed in this outcome but remains confident in the solid team of professionals at @entity4			1
" at a hearing on wednesday , @entity1 acknowledged " making mistakes " when a company he formed overbilled the government in 2004			1
at issue is a contract that @entity1 's company , @entity38 , signed with the @entity39 in early 2004 to provide 40 interrogators and debriefers rapidly in @entity42			1
within four months of his firm starting work on the contract , @entity1 said , the government decided to end the contract			1
" i then faced 40 individuals who were now without work , " the nominee said , adding that some of them he had lured away from other jobs , including the @entity50			2
@entity1 said he told his employees " that i would take care of them , and that i would negotiate and work with the government to provide severance payments			1
" the total severance payments came to about $ 800,000 , @entity1 said			1
" when i went to claim it from the @entity64 [ @entity64 ] , " government auditors " recognized that i did not have a policy on that , that i had not negotiated with the government for severance , i had not provided the government my plan for severance ... and therefore it was not allowed , that $ 800,000			0
" @entity1 said that government auditors subsequently admitted " there were mistakes on both sides			1

sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , said she felt misled by a @entity25 explanation of the events			0
the @entity25 compared $ 2.4 million in disputed charges that included the $ 800,000 in severance payments to the $ 53 million potential value of the contract , instead of the $ 6 million value of the work			0
" of the $ 6 million that @entity38 was paid , $ 2.4 million was [ in ] question			0
that 's a pretty high percentage			2
the @entity25 , in talking to me about this issue , compared it to $ 53 million , but that 's not what was at stake here at all , and i thought the @entity25 's comparison was pretty misleading , " @entity94 said			0
an independent investigation concluded that no fraud was involved			0
ultimately , @entity38 reached a settlement with the government , with @entity38 paying back $ 1.8 million of the disputed $ 2.4 million			0

following the hearing , @entity94 said that @entity1 " adequately addressed my concerns regarding " the contracts			2
" before making a final determination , however , i want to review additional information in order to ensure that all relevant data regarding the nominee have been thoroughly examined , " she said			2

sen. @entity124 , @entity83 - @entity125 , put a hold on the first nominee , @entity127 , after @entity127 declined to say whether he supported unionization of screeners			0
