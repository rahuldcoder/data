-- the most decorated skier in @entity4 history is out for the season -- but not for the rest of her career , experts say , thanks to dramatic advances in treating even some of the worst kinds of knee injuries			1
@entity13 , 28 , was taking a run on the opening day of the @entity16 in @entity17 when she crashed tuesday			1
heart - stopping video of the crash shows @entity21 shoot over a hill and attempt to land the jump off - balance			2
her right knee twists and slams into the mountain , causing her to flip over and smack into a gate			2
@entity27 had to be airlifted off the mountain			1
on the video , she can be heard screaming in pain through the rescue operation			2
doctors will have a better sense of @entity27 's injuries once the swelling goes down and the fluid decreases , experts say			1
as of wednesday , the @entity38 said @entity27 had been evaluated and released from the @entity39			1
dr. @entity40 , who treated @entity27 at the @entity17 hospital , said she does n't need surgery right away , but that she suffered from a " complex torn ligament " in her right knee			1
her anterior cruciate ligament ( @entity47 ) and medial collateral ligament ( @entity49 ) are torn and @entity27 has a lateral fracture of the tibial plateau , the upper end of the tibia or shin bone			1
@entity27 faces race against time acl tears do require surgery , but mcl tears can heal on their own , according to doctors			1
it 's the tibial plateau fracture that will need a much closer look and is the wild card in how long recovery may take , doctors say			1
first , @entity27 will need time			1
the time will allow the mcl ligament and tibia break to heal on its own , depending on its severity , according to dr. @entity71 , a professor of orthopaedics and sports medicine specialist at the @entity74			0
he 's seen a lot of knee injuries over the years as the team doctor for the @entity79 's @entity78			2
" with an mcl tear , you let it heal for two to four weeks and let the scar tissue build up , and only then do you want to go in and do the acl reconstruction , " @entity71 said			0
during this time , @entity27 will likely wear a brace and try to get some motion back			1
it 'll be painful to walk , so she 'll be on crutches or even in a wheelchair			0
doctors will continue to run tests to determine the extent of the injury			0
doctors will use mris and cat scans to determine what approach they 'll have to take for the broken tibia			0
and only then will surgeons go in and repair the acl and figure out if the mcl and bone break needs surgery			2
" back in the 1970s and 1980s we 'd call this a career - ender of an injury , because doctors back then did n't know how to fix it , but we have better techniques and more practice at it , so we now call this injury -- even as horrific as it looked -- a ' career delayer , ' " said @entity71			0
while the rate of injury for skiing overall has declined over the past 60 years because of better equipment and training , knee injuries remain common in the sport , particularly among women , according to a 2003 study			0
@entity129 skiiers " hold the notorious distinction of having among the highest rates of acl injury of any activity or sport , " study authors wrote			0
" she 's an amazing athlete			2
just the amount of training and work that she puts in , i 've seen firsthand in the past			0
if anyone 's going to come back , she can , " said dr. @entity135 , one of the study 's co-authors and an orthopaedic surgeon who works with the @entity4 ski team under the direction of dr. j. @entity142			2
champion skier @entity13 vows to fight on in bid to race the men recovery for a weekend - type athlete would be at least nine months , according to @entity71			1
recovery for a world - class athlete like @entity27 is more in the six - to eight - month range , according to dr. @entity151 , a @entity152 , @entity153 - based doctor at the @entity154 who often travels with the @entity4 ski team and helps with team members ' treatment			1
" it is hard to know without all the information in front of me			0
there are many subtle decisions made on the day of operation , " @entity151 said			0
@entity27 interviewed in 2010 but with @entity27 's physical condition and determination combined with her medical treatment , @entity151 believes @entity27 could recover before the @entity169 , a year and a week away			1
doctors will continue to work with her to help her stay in top shape even without a fully functioning knee			0
" typically when we manage an athlete of her caliber , we find ways to maintain fitness and strength and power as much as possible while she recovers , " @entity151 said			0
a six - to eight - month recovery time does n't leave a lot of training time for the @entity169 , but @entity27 , a 2010 @entity169 gold medalist , is determined to be there , according to her statement			1
" first off , i want to say thank you to the amazing medical staff that cared for me			0
i plan on returning to @entity152 as soon as i can to have the necessary surgeries , " @entity27 said in the statement			1
" i am also grateful to my fans for the outpouring of support , which has really helped me stay positive			0
i can assure you that i will work as hard as humanly possible to be ready to represent my country next year in @entity198 ( @entity199 )			0
" @entity0 's @entity200 contributed to this report .			2
