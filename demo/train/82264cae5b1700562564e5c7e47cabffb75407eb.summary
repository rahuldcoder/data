-- even after she was cleared of murder , even after returning home to a scenic haven in @entity5 , @entity1 is crippled with fear			1
the case that kept her behind bars for four years and hurled her into global notoriety is n't over			2
at any point , the @entity10 could extradite her back to @entity12 to face a retrial since her acquittal was overturned in march			1
during one of her very first interviews as a free woman , @entity15 tells @entity0 's @entity20 that her attempt at resuming a normal life has been punctuated by debilitating panic attacks			1
@entity15 : ' i 'm afraid to go back ' to @entity12 admittedly nervous during the interview , she describes one such episode from the past weekend : " i sit in my hotel room and cry so loud until the security calls the room , because the person next door has heard me crying , " @entity15 says , her voice cracking			1
as she tries to articulate her next thought , @entity15 suppresses more tears			1
" it 's really hard for me to talk to people about it			1
it 's like as soon as i allow myself to cry , i ca n't stop			1
" the sweeping interview reveals fascinating new details of a story that has been widely reported -- but not in her words			2
she slams accusations from authorities that she 's an apathetic sexual deviant whose behavior led to her roommate 's gruesome death			1
was she convicted on a story based partly on a gender stereotype ? or is that just an excuse ? the subtleties in her interview may uncover some answers			2
read an excerpt from @entity15 's book going back to @entity12 @entity15 says she 's afraid to return to @entity12 to face a new trial almost six years after her roommate 's death			1
but she 's considering it			2
" i do n't know yet			0
it 's a really complicated question , " she tells @entity20			2
i mean , i 'm afraid to go back there			2
i do n't want to go back into prison			1
" " i 've been told that in @entity12 , people think it 's arrogant of me to sit here in the @entity10 and have a book come out and defend myself , " says @entity15 , who reportedly was paid a $ 3.8 million advance for her memoir , " waiting to be heard			1
" " first of all , i find that incredibly unfair , because i have the right to defend myself			0
and no one can ask me to just shut up because it 's convenient			2
but at the same time , i want to prove to them that i care about what 's going on			2
" @entity15 has been criticized for what some perceived as apathy over the death of her study - abroad roommate , @entity91 , in 2007			1
@entity92 , a 21 - year - old @entity93 exchange student , was found dead , seminaked with her throat slashed , in the @entity96 villa she rented with @entity15			1
but @entity15 says she 's been unfairly characterized as cold and aloof after @entity92 's death			1
" i find it incredible that despite an absolute lack of evidence that connects me to this murder , i am still being judged based upon unrealistic and unreasonable expectations about how a young woman would react to a horrible situation			0
no one knows how they would react to a horrible situation until it happens to them , " she says			0
" i definitely reacted to what happened to her			0
and i react to this day			0
i 'm emotional to this day about what happened			0
but i 'm also the type of person who , when there is pressure on me and expectation on me to react , to feel in front of people , i freeze			0
i would much rather suppress my emotion than have it be determined as insincere and affected			0
" @entity15 and her ex-boyfriend @entity122 were convicted of killing @entity92			1
both were acquitted in 2011 , but their acquittals were overturned in march			2
" as i was going through all of this , when i cried , it was bad			0
when i did n't cry , it was bad			0
when i smiled , it was bad			0
when i did n't smile , it was bad , " @entity15 says			1
" ... i have been paralyzed by this kind of scrutiny			0
and i feel like it 's unfair			2
" will @entity15 be extradited to @entity12 ? experts disagree on likelihood claims of sexual deviancy at times , the depictions of @entity15 in court were as scandalous as plot lines in a made - for - tv movie			1
" they were calling me things like violent and whore and deviant			2
and it 's all untrue , " @entity15 tells @entity20			1
prosecutors theorized she was involved in some sort of erotic game gone horribly wrong that resulted in the death of her roommate			1
@entity15 says such claims were " a bombardment of falsehood and fantasy			1
" " no one has ever claimed that i was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity			1
none of my roommates , none of my friends , none of the people who knew me there			0
this is simply coming out of the prosecution , " she says			0
" i was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip			0
i have never done that			0
i have never taken part in an orgy			0
" she says there has been recent discussion " about how our society latches onto the idea of a violent , sexual woman , how sexuality becomes deviancy , becomes violent " and how " the connection between those things is so easily made in comparison to men			2
" " i was completely recharacterized as a human being based upon the fact that i was sexually active			0
and that turned into sexual deviancy			2
and it was unfair , " @entity15 says			1
" and i was having to go into the courtroom when the jury and judge were already convinced of a certain idea of what kind of person i was			0
and there was nothing i could do to respond to it			0
" opinion : what @entity15 can and ca n't tell us implicating an innocent man even though she was acquitted of the murder charge , @entity15 does n't have a spotless record			1
after she and @entity122 were detained for questioning in the killing , she allegedly confessed to being at her home when @entity92 was killed and implicated @entity91 , the owner of a bar where she worked			0
@entity211 was detained but was released after two weeks when his alibi was corroborated : he had spent the night of the murder talking to a customer in his pub in @entity96 , police said			0
@entity211 later sued @entity15 for libel , winning 40,000 euros ( $ 54,000 ) in damages			1
@entity15 says her book gives readers insight into what she was thinking in the days and months after @entity92 's death			1
" i 'm aware of the fact that people do n't seem to get where i 'm coming from when i named @entity91 , for instance			0
and i ca n't excuse it			0
but i can try to explain it			0
and that 's the only -- the only thing i can do , " @entity15 says			1
analysis : @entity15 case is complicated , confusing mess her life today despite the panic attacks , @entity15 is trying to get her life back to normal			1
she 's back with a boyfriend whom she knew before she was in @entity12			1
she 's going to school and is making up lost time with her family			2
but she still has n't reached out to @entity91 's family			2
why ? " i know that they think that i 'm guilty , " @entity15 tells @entity20			1
" ... i wish that i had gotten ahold of them much earlier , at the very beginning			0
" during the interview , @entity15 's hands appeared to show signs of injuries			1
she says she was taking self - defense training			1
" i 've received death threats since i 've been home			1
and i do n't ever want to be caught in a situation that @entity91 was caught in where someone is able to overpower me because i just do n't know what to do , " @entity15 says			1
" there are not normal people who are fixated on me			0
and i do n't know what they 're capable of			0
" her desire , @entity15 says , is that within five years she will finally feel at ease			1
" i hope that i will be definitively found innocent , " she says			0
" i hope that i can reconcile myself with @entity264 and @entity91 's family			2
" she worries about a lifetime of answering questions from doubters			0
" i really want this to be behind me			0
i do n't know how long i can hold it together			0
i do n't know how long i can defend myself			0
