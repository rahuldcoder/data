-- the @entity3 / @entity2 tale is a great and irresistible publishing story -- but it 's only the second - best i 've ever heard			1
you may have read about @entity3 and @entity2 last week			1
@entity3 , whose @entity8 books have sold more than 450 million copies , is the most successful author in the world			1
@entity2 , whose new detective novel " @entity2 " had been selling dismally , does n't exist			1
fast facts : @entity3 she wrote and published " @entity2 " under @entity2 's name , to see what would happen if readers and critics did n't know she was the author			1
the book received glowing reviews , but few readers purchased a copy			1
then , last weekend , the secret was revealed , and " @entity2 " zoomed to no. 1 best - seller status			2
@entity3 , in a statement , said , " it has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation , and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name			1
" yet top - echelon executives at @entity3 's publisher knew all along that she was @entity2 -- that she had written the book			1
and they presumably knew that , once the word got out , they would have an enormous and profitable blockbuster on their hands			2
but what if @entity2 really had been @entity2 ? what if an unknown author by that name had tried to sell " @entity2 " to a publisher ? best - selling female authors with male monikers as good as the book is , would a publisher have taken a chance on it ? before you answer " of course , " consider the case of @entity50 -- the protagonist of the most instructive , the most damning , and the most hilarious true story about publishing there ever has been			1
i interviewed him and reported on his story almost 35 years ago			2
@entity50 , in the 1970s , was a young would - be author who was trying with no success to get his first novel published			1
he was receiving nothing but rejection slips			2
he wondered whether his writing really was that unappealing , or if publishers were simply turning him down because he was an unknown			1
so he decided upon a clever , if highly unconventional , way to find out			2
in those pre-personal - computer days , he sat down at a typewriter and copied every single word of the novel " steps , " by @entity69			2
" steps " had won the @entity70 in 1969 , had received superlative reviews and was a big best - seller			2
once @entity50 had finished typing up the manuscript , he made sure not to put a title on it			2
he did put a byline on it : his own			2
he made copies , and he mailed them off			0
the recipients were 14 major publishing houses			0
four of those houses had published books by @entity69			0
one of them had published " steps			0
" the manuscript was turned down by all 14 houses			0
none realized that it was rejecting " steps			0
" @entity90 , which had published @entity69 's " being there , " wrote to @entity50 : " while your prose style is very lucid , the content of the book did n't inspire the level of enthusiasm here that a publisher should have for any book on their list in order to do well by it			1
" @entity104 , which had published three of @entity69 's books , wrote @entity50 to say that it did not wish to publish what @entity50 had sent			1
not that the editors thought he was a bad writer -- they said they admired his style : " @entity69 comes to mind as a point of comparison when reading the stark , chilly , episodic incidents you have set down			0
" but , they said in their rejection letter , what @entity50 had sent them " does n't add up to a satisfactory whole			1
it has some very impressive moments , but gives the impression of sketchiness and incompleteness			0
" they wrote that they would be happy to consider future efforts by him , but that this one just did n't work			1
@entity124 , which had published " steps , " sent a form letter rejecting the retyped " steps			1
" @entity50 thought that maybe the problem was that he was submitting his novel -- that is , @entity69 's novel -- without the assistance of a literary agent			0
so he sent the manuscript to 13 top agents , asking if they would represent it			0
not one of them was interested			0
some excerpts from the agents ' rejection letters : " i 'm afraid the novel 's episodic nature and the lack of strong characterization would not allow this book to compete in a very tough fiction market			1
" and : " from the section i read of your untitled novel , it seems too fragmented and dreamlike to be a good commercial bet			0
" and : " thanks for having sent me your untitled novel			0
you write clearly and well , but i felt that the novel jumped around so much that it did not hold interest , and i would not be the right agent for it			0
" when @entity50 went public with what he had done , he expected the publishers and agents to be a little embarrassed that they had turned down a @entity70 - winning novel			0
but , he told me when i interviewed him at the time , " i guess not			0
i went to the @entity163 convention to talk to the publishers about what i did			0
they all thought that it was very amusing or silly			0
they agreed that it probably could happen again tomorrow			0
but the attitude was , ' so what ? ' " as lovely as the @entity3 / @entity2 saga is , what would have made it even better , and turned it into more of a cliffhanger , is if @entity3 had gone the @entity50 route : if she had , without revealing her identity , sent " @entity2 " to publishers cold -- if she had submitted it and let them think that it really was by a novice named @entity2			1
would any of them have snapped it up ? it may be a terrific book -- but so was " steps			2
" and without @entity69 's name on the manuscript , " steps " could n't find a publisher			1
even though it had already won the @entity70			0
it 's enough to drive even @entity8 to drink			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1

@entity196 : @entity3 used *pseudonym* to publish book that did n't sell , but critics liked
she was outed as author , sales of the book soared
@entity196 : if publisher had n't known it was @entity3 , it would have been a more telling tale
he says once an unknown author retyped a *famous* novel ; no publisher would take it
