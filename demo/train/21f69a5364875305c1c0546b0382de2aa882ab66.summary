@entity3 prime minister @entity2 's open conflict with @entity5 president @entity4 over his diplomacy with @entity7 has not only served a blow to the @entity5 - @entity3 relationship			1
it has also collapsed @entity3 's otherwise arguably successful @entity7 policy			1
contrary to @entity3 's rhetoric , the fear of @entity7 getting a nuclear weapon has not been the driving factor of @entity3 policy on @entity7 since the early 1990s			1
obviously , @entity7 obtaining a nuclear weapon would be highly undesirable for @entity3			0
but that has not been @entity3 's primary concern			2
rather , the fear has been that @entity21 would end up finding a compromise with @entity7 that on the one hand would close off any @entity7 path to a bomb , but on the other hand would lock in a shift in the regional balance of power in @entity3 's disfavor			1
regardless of the details of a nuclear deal with @entity7 , a deal per se would reduce @entity21 's tensions with @entity34 , while not necessarily tempering the @entity3 - @entity7 rivalry proportionally			2
@entity3 will be " abandoned " to face @entity7 alone , @entity3 fear			0
moreover , a deal would signal , the argument goes , that @entity21 has accepted and will not contest @entity7 's geopolitical advances in the region			0
@entity7 has hegemonic aspirations , @entity3 contends , and must be stopped , not accommodated			0
after a deal with @entity7 , @entity21 would be even more likely to shift its geopolitical focus elsewhere and be less intertwined with @entity3 's needs			1
the @entity5 - @entity7 enmity has ensured @entity21 's commitment to isolating and containing @entity7 , much to @entity3 's satisfaction			1
if your interest dictates that the @entity5 and @entity7 must remain firmly at odds with each other , a nuclear deal -- any deal -- would eliminate the most explosive point of contention between @entity21 and @entity34 and lessen @entity5 's inclination to confront @entity7 on other matters , @entity3 believes			1
as @entity3 's defense minister @entity63 said earlier this week : " [ @entity64 ] very deal that will be signed between the @entity58 and this messianic and apocalyptic regime will strike a severe blow to @entity62 and @entity3 interests			2
" this also explains why @entity2 has been contradicting his own intelligence services and exaggerated and misconstrued @entity7 's nuclear activities			2
@entity3 's policy towards @entity7 and the nuclear issue in the past two decades has rested on a few principles			1
first , consecutive @entity3 governments have been on the forefront of sounding the alarm about @entity7 , while carefully avoiding making @entity7 an " @entity3 issue			0
" at times , @entity3 has tried to tone down its rhetoric , both to avoid making the nuclear file an @entity3 issue , but also to avoid making @entity3 shine too bright on the @entity7 threat radar			0
when @entity2 was first elected prime minister , he requested an intelligence assessment of @entity3 's security environment			1
the debate was largely on whether @entity7 or @entity85 constituted @entity3 's greatest external threat			1
@entity2 decided to go with the assessment of the @entity88 , presented by @entity89 , who argued that @entity3 could either make itself @entity7 's prime enemy by continuing belligerent rhetoric against @entity34 , or it could tone things down and let @entity7 focus on other threats			1
" until the @entity2 government , there was a proliferation of @entity3 statements trying to deter @entity7 , warning @entity7 , the long arm of the @entity3 air force etc. that was stopped , to his credit , by @entity2 , " @entity3 journalist @entity95 told me in an interview for my book @entity99 - the @entity100 of @entity3 , @entity7 and the @entity5			1
ultimately , @entity3 was successful at turning the world 's focus towards @entity7 's nuclear activities			2
the international community , led by @entity21 , began regarding @entity7 's nuclear issue as a primary threat to international security , imposed @entity117 sanctions on @entity7 and the @entity5 even openly debated bombing the country			2
but over the course of the past 18 months , the @entity2 government has made @entity7 all about @entity3			1
while virtually the entire world is eager for a peaceful nuclear deal , @entity3 stands alone ( bar a few @entity123 states in the @entity124 ) in opposing the talks			0
while @entity3 helped shape international consensus about @entity7 's nuclear program in the years past , @entity3 is today decisively outside of that consensus			2
second , while @entity3 calculated that preventing a @entity5 - @entity7 deal would best serve its interest , it needed to retain the flexibility to shift its position if and when an agreement was likely to be reached			1
by adopting a more cooperative tone with @entity21 , @entity3 's flexibility would enable it to influence the deal and reduce its potential downsides for @entity3			2
for instance , when @entity5 president @entity139 started sending strong signals to @entity7 's newly elected reformist president @entity141 in the late 1990s , then - prime minister @entity138 softened @entity3 's tone towards @entity7 in order to minimize any negative side - effects of a @entity5 - @entity7 deal for @entity3			1
he symbolically reduced @entity7 from " enemy " to " threat , " signaling that he did n't see @entity3 - @entity7 enmity as inevitable			0
@entity139 's outreach to @entity7 never bore fruit , so @entity3 never had to deal with its potential repercussions			0
but @entity138 signaled his openness and ability to adjust to such a scenario , recognizing that @entity3 's most important relationship after all was that with @entity5			1
but this flexibility has been completely abandoned or lost under @entity2 's leadership			0
ever since @entity4 took office , @entity2 has actively sought to first prevent diplomacy , then undermine diplomacy to his current stance of building up opposition to @entity4 's prospective deal with @entity34			0
@entity2 has taken it to an extreme			0
he has been so disruptive that the @entity4 administration has felt compelled to reduce information sharing about the negotiations with his government , lest he would leak it to undercut the talks			0
the more @entity2 has sought to undermine the talks , the more @entity3 has lost its ability to impact the negotiations			0
by now , @entity2 has crossed the real " point of no return			0
" confidence in him is completely lost in the @entity177 , so he can not adopt @entity138 's posture			0
his only remaining options is to double down on opposing a nuclear deal with @entity7 , even at the cost of an open war with the @entity5 president , of damaging @entity5 - @entity3 relations beyond @entity4 , and of making @entity3 a partisan issue			1
such is the logic of adopting extremist positions			0
rather than depriving the other side of options and maneuverability , @entity2 has painted @entity3 in a corner .			0

@entity2 's open conflict with president @entity4 over @entity7 has served as blow to @entity5 - @entity3 relationship , says @entity197
@entity197 : conflict has also damaged @entity3 's otherwise arguably successful @entity7 policy by painting country into corner
over course of past 18 months , @entity2 government has made @entity7 all about @entity3 , @entity197 argues
