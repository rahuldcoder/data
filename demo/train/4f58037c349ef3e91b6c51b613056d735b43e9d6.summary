-- " keep the government 's hands off my @entity2			1
" those words -- quoted by so many tv talking heads -- never seem actually to have been spoken by anyone			0
it 's like that poodle in the microwave story : everybody has a neighbor who heard it from his cousin			0
the town hallers were angry , but they were not crazy , and they were not stupid			1
they knew perfectly well that @entity2 is provided by the government			1
they also knew that their government is proposing to change @entity2 in ways they do not like			1
the health care reform plans backed by president @entity23 would cut hundreds of billions out of the the growth of @entity2 spending over the next 10 years			1
more ominous for seniors than the dollar figure is the plan behind the number			0
the president wants to reduce spending on @entity31 , the privately run plans that offer seniors a better deal than conventional @entity2			2
over the longer term , the president aspires to shift @entity2 patients to teams of health care providers paid by the year , instead of individual doctors charging fees for each particular service -- rather than by the particular medical service they perform			2
meet new @entity4 contributor @entity43 the changes the president has in mind wo n't kill @entity46			1
but they will change medicine in ways @entity46 may find uncomfortable			1
ten years from now , @entity46 probably wo n't have a personal doctor			1
her @entity2 will cover less -- and cost more			1
@entity2 was under pressure even before the election of @entity23			1
the gap between the future revenues and future obligations of @entity2 and @entity56 is estimated by the @entity56 trustees at some $ 45 trillion			2
how much is that ? adjusting for inflation , it 's the cost of fighting @entity61 -- 10 times			2
@entity2 is the single biggest spending commitment of the @entity64			2
as @entity23 stacks enormous new health care spending commitments atop the old , @entity2 's already bleak future grows dimmer still			1
who wins as @entity2 loses ? the short answer is : the uninsured			1
the president will use the money squeezed from @entity2 to extend some form of coverage to the 35 million to 40 million people estimated to lack health insurance			1
and who are these people ? about one - quarter of them are foreign - born			0
recent immigrants to the @entity64 -- unlike the immigrations who arrived between @entity61 and 1970 -- have tended to be very low - skilled			0
their labor is just not worth enough to their employers to support the high cost of an @entity64 health insurance plan : $ 13,000 a year , on average , for a family of four			1
so here 's how the world looks to a @entity2 enrollee : over the opposition of some 80 percent of the @entity64 people , your government allowed millions of poor newcomers to enter the country , many of them illegally			1
( over the past 10 years , half of all immigrants to the @entity64 have arrived illegally			0
) these people cut the lawns of your more affluent neighbors , tended their babies , cleared their tables after their restaurant meals			0
if you were not so affluent , they reduced your wages and crowded your schools , highways and hospital emergency rooms			0
now you are being told that your old age will be made less comfortable to accommodate them			0
unsurprisingly , you do n't like it			0
the debate about immigration and health care has centered on whether immigrants who are here illegally might qualify for coverage under the @entity119 ' reforms			0
theoretically , they will not be eligible , but since @entity119 have so far voted against enforcement measures , some illegal immigrants will no doubt slip through			0
but the debate over illegal immigrants is a proxy for something larger and more unsettling to older @entity64			0
the problem is not illegal immigration , it is all low - skilled immigration , legal and illegal			0
by importing tens of millions of people who earn too little to pay for their own health insurance , we have made this supremely difficult social problem radically more difficult than it ever needed to be			2
with " @entity133 , " the bill for four decades of permissive immigration has at last come due			0
since the 1930s , the @entity64 has run two different kinds of government social programs			0
one kind of program is sustained by contributions from the very same people who will benefit from the program in future : @entity56 , unemployment insurance , workers ' compensation			1
these programs have never been controversial			0
the other kind of program taxes some for the benefit of others : @entity153 , social housing , the old welfare programs for the poor			2
these programs have always been intensely resented			0
@entity2 was the first kind of program : social insurance			1
@entity23 's public option will be the second kind of program : income transfer			1
that 's the explanation for the resistance the president is encountering			2
and it 's the emotion that explains the actual quote -- not the bogus quote -- we heard from so many town hall protesters this summer : " fix old			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity43 .			0

town hallers know government wants to change @entity2 in ways they do n't like , @entity43 says
he says changes wo n't kill @entity46 , but @entity2 will cover less and cost more
changes will benefit the uninsured , some of whom ca n't pay for insurance , he says
@entity188 : resistance to @entity23 's plan comes because it will be an income transfer program
