@entity0 , @entity1 -- the problem has become so complicated , that perhaps only a child can solve it			2
an 11 - year - old @entity1 boy , @entity6 , entered a serious economics competition with a plan for bringing the @entity10 economy back from the brink			0
in the end , @entity6 , the youngest ever to enter the @entity12 , received a 100 euro voucher for his original idea -- conceived on the notion of exchanging debt for slices of pizza			1
maybe @entity20 can invite him for some budget brainstorming			2
meanwhile , @entity23 's crisis goes on , still in need of creative solutions			1
beyond the placid old @entity0 canals , the bustling bike lanes and the quaint tulip fields , roils a furious debate about the future of the @entity1			0
on the surface , the issue is what to do about the budget deficit			2
in reality , it is about whose life will become more difficult			2
who will pay more ? who will receive less ? it is a question coming soon to a deficit - spending country near you : the @entity44			1
in other parts of @entity23 , in places like @entity10 and @entity48 , similar discussions have toppled several governments and have escalated into huge , sometimes violent protests , as people lash out in frustration against government decisions they find intolerable			1
i believe that some time next year , with the election in the past , when either @entity57 has started his second term or @entity59 has finished unpacking in the @entity60 , @entity44 , too , will discover that budget debates are not just academic exercises or political theater			1
it 's a good bet that just as @entity23 has come up against the reality that deficits can not grow forever , so too will @entity44			1
investors , who have taken losses in the @entity23 debacle , will start looking at @entity44 's books , questioning its solvency , and demanding change			1
the @entity23 economic crisis has unfolded most dramatically in @entity10 , where the economy has plunged into a depression			1
with its budget deficit and national debt rising out of control , the @entity10 government sought help from the eurozone , where rich countries demanded stark austerity measures in exchange for a bailout			1
@entity10 , like other countries in @entity23 , had given up its own currency in exchange for the euro , so it did not have the option of printing more money or devaluing the currency to pull itself out of the mess created in part by politicians who gave voters what they wanted without troubling to bring up the unpleasant fact that someone , sooner or later , would have to pay			1
today , the @entity10 people are enduring economic pain that makes @entity44 look like a paradise of prosperity			1
unemployment stands at 21 % , wages are collapsing for both government and private sector workers			0
a series of new taxes have been imposed , including a " solidarity " tax , new property taxes and higher self - employment taxes			0
the @entity114 , a national sales tax on all transactions , has jumped from 13 % to 23 %			0
the minimum wage has been been sharply cut			0
after all that , @entity10 is still required by @entity23 rules to cut another 4.7 % of gross domestic product from its budget , equivalent to the @entity44 suddenly cutting more than $ 700 billion			1
even if it achieves those goals , or rather because it will enact such draconian cuts , the @entity10 economy is expected to sink deeper			0
the @entity23 economic pact requires countries to keep their budget deficits below 3 % of gdp			1
that became increasingly difficult as the world entered a recession			2
in @entity10 's case , the government had been concealing its deficit spending			0
in other countries , especially those that relied heavily on real estate , home prices collapsed , and tax revenues declined , opening up the budget gap			2
the @entity1 economy , one of the healthier ones , now faces a 4.6 % deficit			0
there 's talk of across - the - board pay freezes and even more social safety - net cuts , among other ideas			2
unemployment is just 6 % , but the country has returned to recession			2
in @entity48 , the government wants to avoid requiring a bailout the way @entity10 , @entity156 and @entity157 have			0
the newly - installed government of prime minister @entity159 needs to slash the budget by 5.5 % of @entity129 , even more than @entity10			2
@entity48 expects unemployment , already the worst in the developed world , to go over 24 % this year , about the same experienced by the @entity44 during the @entity163			1
the @entity23 crisis is far from over , but it already has important lessons for the @entity44 , where federal deficit figures are treated as poison darts to be thrown among politicians , rather than as an important problem needing adult solutions			1
the top three lessons from @entity23 are these : â € ¢ deficits matter and sooner or later will have to be cut â € ¢ trying to cut deficits in the middle of a recession makes the recession worse â € ¢ when the cutting starts , it will cause major social and political upheaval , as well as very real pain			1
unlike most @entity23 countries , the @entity44 has the luxury of printing money and borrowing almost at will			1
the crisis in @entity23 has actually made it more attractive to lend to the @entity44 , so it 's easy to pretend the deficit and the debt do n't matter			1
but @entity44 's deficit of about 10 % of gdp and debt of $ 15 trillion , roughly 100 % of @entity129 , can not go on forever			1
interest payments on the debt already consume more than $ 200 billion each year , and the debt is rising at blinding speed			0
the @entity44 was right to deal with the recession first before tackling the longer term problem			1
@entity23 is proving what the @entity198 administration already showed in the 1930s , that cutting spending in a recession is counter-productive			1
but , with the economy recovering , the time will soon come for the difficult decisions : will the government cut defense spending , @entity208 , or @entity209 ? or perhaps other programs that keep millions out of poverty ? in the @entity1 , the ruling coalition has been brought to the edge of collapse over the choices			0
the far - right politician @entity216 demanded huge reductions in foreign aid			0
there is also talk of ending the mortgage tax deduction , along with other tax increases			0
social services have been reduced and food banks say they have seen an " explosion " in the number of clients			0
and the government is still looking for more cuts			0
the choices go to the heart of a nation 's character			0
voters in the @entity44 should insistently demand that presidential candidates say exactly what they will do about the deficit			2
they should also demand that politicians at long last resolve -- not just debate -- the problem			0
will politicians behave responsibly ? if you hear anyone say tax cuts alone will get the economy growing and fix the problem , do n't believe it			0
economists say spending cuts and tax increases are necessary			0
if adults wo n't face up to the truth , maybe it 's time to bring in the children for new ideas , and for a reminder of what 's at stake			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			0

@entity262 : the pain of budget **cutbacks** is being felt in many parts of @entity23
she says in reality the decisions are about who will pay more -- and receive less
@entity44 has rightly been *spared* budget **cutbacks** in the midst of a recession , she says
@entity276 : the @entity44 debt is growing at *unsustainable* pace , day of reckoning is coming
