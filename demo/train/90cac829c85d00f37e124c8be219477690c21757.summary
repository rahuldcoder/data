according to city workers on the internet forum @entity13 , he had worked until 6 a.m. for three days in a row			1
while no direct link has been made , the death of the @entity17 business student has put the spotlight on grueling hours suffered by interns looking to impress bosses and competing with each other			1
internships such as @entity8 's pay around Â £ 45,000 ( $ 70,500 ) a year , pro rata , and jostling comes as youth unemployment in @entity28 soars to record levels , hitting 23 % in 2012			1
a @entity6 spokesman said the bank was " shocked and saddened " by the news			0
the spokesman declined to comment on unconfirmed reports @entity8 had epilepsy			1
@entity36 professor @entity35 told @entity0 interns are expected to work long hours to show their commitment to prospective employers , rather than being productive			1
" the real reasons are cultural			0
all - nighters are seen as a rite of passage , " @entity35 said			2
" they show an intern is willing to push themselves beyond any reasonable limits at work ... if large firms hope to be sustainable and attractive to employees , they need to tackle the extreme hours culture , " he said			2
according to the bank , all @entity6 interns are assigned a " buddy , " and some get a staffing officer whose job it is to allocate work across the group to make sure it 's manageable			2
@entity61 , head of skills and policy campaign at the @entity64 , told @entity0 employers try to make internships a positive experience for young people			0
balance must be kept , she said , to ensure interns were not overburdened			2
she said : " young people really struggle with market access and they can be quite desperate ... to get their foot on the job ladder and are willing to do whatever it takes			0
in some cases that can be too much			0
" @entity79 added : " another issue is that a lot of young people have not experienced a work place before so they do n't know the rules and what is expected of them			0
they do n't challenge their employers			0
" @entity8 was in the sixth week of a seven week internship when he died			1
@entity6 's interns have since been told they can leave the program early without negatively affecting chances of future employment			2
@entity94 , author of the @entity95 , told @entity0 increased media scrutiny on internships , particularly in the @entity98 , is forcing companies to be more careful when employing young people			0
he said : " it 's the type of news story that will catch fire very quickly , if a reputable organization is not doing its duty with interns			2
organizations are very conscious of these things because they do n't want a bad reputation			0
" @entity8 -- who had completed internships with a number of other banks -- was staying in a ground - floor flat at @entity114 , a four - storey building known as " banker 's block " due to its reputation for housing interns in the summer months			1
the @entity6 spokesman said of @entity8 : " he was popular amongst his peers and was a highly - diligent intern at our company with a promising future			1
