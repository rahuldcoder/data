-- @entity1 finds a bag of slightly bruised apples and day - old bread left in a supermarket 's dumpster too tempting to pass up			1
@entity7 rummages through discarded produce in trash bins outside a @entity11 grocery store			1
" a lot of perfectly good food is thrown away , " says @entity12 , a spokeswoman for @entity14 , a @entity15 group that promotes " freeganism , " which eschews conventional commerce in favor of a lifestyle that uses minimal resources			1
freegans try not to buy things new -- not even food			1
jumping into a garbage bin may sound scary , but @entity12 , 52 , who lives in @entity26 , says it 's no big deal			1
humans , she says , are " hardwired to be foragers			1
" for the thousands who search online for free merchandise , pick up roadside castoffs and even dig through @entity34 , paying for everything they need is yesterday 's news			1
at a time when many @entity40 are on tighter budgets and worrying about environmental conservation , the practice may get more popular			1
roadside treasures sometimes opportunities present themselves			1
" i have picked up several free things over the years from the side of the road , " says @entity45 , 38 , a @entity46 stay - at - home mom			1
she recalls her acquisitions with a sense of achievement : there was the easel for her daughter ; a set of like - new ceramic casserole dishes ; a toy dump truck			2
send us your recycling photos , videos " i 'm saving money , but i 'm also reducing the amount of stuff that needs to be produced and that eventually may end up in a landfill , " says may , a founding member of going @entity64 , a @entity46 grassroots organization that helps families run environmentally friendly households			1
@entity15 resident @entity71 , 32 , agrees that curbside shopping is the way to go			2
" my whole apartment is furnished with discards , " she says			2
" i find really great stuff all the time			2
here in @entity15 , it 's kind of obscene how much goes into the trash			2
" @entity71 helped launch @entity79 , a local recycling event where people share their unwanted items			1
" our goal is to have everything find a new home , " she says			2
free commerce before hitting the mall , find out whether someone in your city is getting rid of the thing you want , says @entity93 , 40 , founder of @entity93 , a web site built on the premise that " one person 's trash is another 's treasure			1
" here 's how it works : as in the " free " section of @entity103 , users post what they 're giving or seeking , then coordinate the details			1
on thousands of @entity93 message boards , the dialogue looks like this : offered : two @entity110 dispensers			2
@entity111 : @entity113 espresso machine			2
wanted : garden hose that works			2
offered : adult diapers , size small			0
it 's an eclectic mix , but that means there 's something for everyone , says @entity122			0
he launched the nonprofit group four years ago with 20 or 30 friends			0
now it has 4.5 million users , he says , with 70,000 newcomers each week helping to reduce the growth of landfills			0
at the heart of @entity93 , @entity122 says , is a spirit of giving , not getting : people in @entity133 collected prom dresses for teenage girls ; a 95 - year - old @entity137 man looks for old bikes he can fix up and give to disadvantaged children ; others have joined together to find clothing and supplies for orphans in @entity144			0
@entity122 uses the site , too , but only for giving			0
" my wife has made it clear that it 's good for purging , not collecting , " he says			0
" but i did get a @entity150 once			0
" the people giving it away turned out to be neighbors he had never met			0
" when i picked up the grill , they also gave me a half dozen eggs from their chickens , " he says			0
" it 's a beautiful example of community giving			0
" @entity161 started last year to provide a similar service , and @entity163 lists hundreds of organizations across the country with the same goals			0
dumpster diving @entity168 about dumpster diving ? @entity14 keeps a city - by - city listing of prime dumpster locations , from bakeries to bookstores			0
large chain stores in wealthy neighborhoods are particularly prone to tossing edible foods , @entity12 says			0
if you go , she advises , bring a friend ( in case the lid closes on you ) and wear gloves to protect your hands from glass and other sharp objects			0
ask your local police department first whether it 's ok -- some cities have criminalized dumpster diving			0
do n't salvage things that need to be refrigerated or show traces of mold , and thoroughly wash any food you 've taken from a dumpster before consuming			1
it 's also a good idea to conduct a smell test of any food you may take ; if it smells bad , it probably is spoiled and should be avoided			1
@entity12 says freeganism has nothing to do with income			0
she says many divers , herself included , have at least moderate incomes : " it 's really about boycotting the consumerist system			0
" but not everything can be found in a dumpster			1
@entity12 admits that some things must be acquired the old - fashioned way : at the store			1
like cooking oil -- " you can never find enough of that			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity0 provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to web publishers			1
@entity220 's work has appeared in " gourmet , " " health , " " @entity223 , " and many other publications .			0

everything from food to clothes to *furniture* can be found in @entity34
