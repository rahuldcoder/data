@entity0 -- @entity2 , the 72 - year - old media mogul turned environmentalist and philanthropist , has decided that nuclear power may not be the answer to the world 's energy woes , but it 's still better than coal			1
" i 'd rather have nuclear power than coal , " he told an audience at the @entity13 in @entity0 on the first day of the @entity15 meeting			1
" one will kill you for sure , and the other might			2
i 'll take ' might ' over ' sure			2
' " still , last march 's nuclear disaster at @entity22 's @entity21 plant soured him on the technology as a replacement for coal and a cure for climate change , he said			1
@entity29 building of a nuclear power plant in @entity31 that 's because nuclear power is costly and dangerous , he said			1
" you 've got the problem of what to do with the spent fuel , and nobody wants it			2
so it 's being stored all over the world			2
" those storage places include a number of locations that could prove dangerous , since they tend to be near power plants , and the plants tend to be located near population centers , he said			1
@entity2 is an investor in alternative - energy projects , the largest of which is a 250 - acre solar array in @entity55 , @entity56 , that powers 9,000 homes , he said			1
his partner in the project is @entity59 , the largest utility in the @entity60 and the biggest customer of coal , which he derided for increasing the incidence of asthma			2
but alternative energies still have a long way to go , he acknowledged			2
the next big challenge akin to creating the interstate highway system will be to create the technology to move the power created by wind and solar energy to where it is needed , he said			1
" we need a whole new digital transmission across the country , " he said			2
but the @entity78 administration is not in a position to help much , he said			2
" health care was so divisive and controversial and complicated that it completely polarized the government , and we 've had basically a lockup situation since then where very little has occurred , " he said			1
@entity2 called for more resources worldwide to be invested in projects like health care and funding for the @entity87 , to which he himself pledged $ 1 billion to create the @entity90			1
he critiqued the @entity92 media for what he described as a narrow vision that does not include much international news			1
" i need to know what 's going on in the whole world , " he said			2
" that 's why i think the @entity87 is so important ; that we have a place where we can get organized and deal with problems -- overfishing , pollution of the atmosphere , deforestation , global climate change , refugees , world hunger			1
those are things that one country can not solve by itself , not even the @entity92			1
" @entity2 said he keeps abreast of world events by reading @entity112 , a @entity114 publication , on the @entity115			1
asked about the future of print , he said , " gone			0
like coal and oil , they served us well			0
" but that does n't mean there is no future for paper			0
" what would we do without toilet paper ? " he said to laughter			0
" we still need that			0
" @entity2 said he depends on his sense of humor to " make it through " and credited his ability to make friends for the success of @entity1 , which he founded in 1980 but no longer is involved in			1
" i studied history and it looked to me like the people who did the best in life were the ones who made the most friends , " he said			0
" the ones who made the most enemies did not do well			0
that 's what happens when you bomb people			0
you do n't make people like you when you bomb people			0
" when he was at the helm of @entity1 , everyone in the world was a potential customer , so he went out of his way to make friends with the likes of former @entity162 president @entity161 and " the godless @entity163 in @entity164 and @entity165 , " he said			2
" the next thing you know , they were friends			0
" rather than sending troops abroad , the @entity92 should consider trying to make friends by sending doctors and engineers instead , he said			1
" people do n't terrorize people who are their sponsor			0
" @entity2 said he would like to see the world cut military expenditures over 10 years by 10 % per year , which would give countries enough time to find things for the current crop of military personnel to do and save enough money to " eliminate poverty and solve most human problems			1
" war has come close to bankrupting the nation , and there is no reason for it , he said			0
" it made good sense back in the @entity192 , when there was nothing else to do			0
we did n't have tv and there was no @entity198 , no @entity199			0
the only thing to do to keep from being bored to tears was to go out and fight			0
" but " we 've got other things to do now , " he said , citing the sex aid @entity204 as one of them , then adding , " that 's what i mean about a sense of humor			0
" @entity2 refused to offer advice to those in his audience searching for the key to success			1
but , reflecting on the 2001 @entity217 merger that resulted in his losing some 90 % of his money , he said , " being poor and then rich and facing the prospect of being poor again is not a very pleasant prospect			0
do n't let anybody tell you otherwise			0
it 's nice to be able to afford dessert			0
" @entity2 predicted his point of view on the environment would prevail over those of " republicans and tea party people who do n't believe in global warming -- we 're just going to outwork them and outlast them			1
" after his speech , he told a reporter that he likes president @entity78 , but thinks he has " a tough job			0
" asked how he thinks @entity78 is handling that job , @entity2 said , " it 's hard to be critical of the way someone is doing a job you do n't want yourself			1
