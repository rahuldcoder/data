-- early next month , @entity1 will pack up the belongings of her @entity4 flat , say goodbye to friends and set - off for her new home in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the " @entity8 " was once regarded as the engine room of the @entity12 economy but it has fallen upon hard times in recent decades -- or so the popular narrative goes			1
now , a new venture which combines housing and the literary arts is hoping to paint the modern story of the @entity8 in a more positive light			1
@entity1 is the first person to receive a home completely for free as part of the @entity24 program			1
the non-profit project is buying up and renovating foreclosed homes using crowd - sourced funds in the city 's @entity29 district			1
it then gives them to promising literary prospects in the fields of fiction , non-fiction , screen writing , poetry and journalism among others			2
all @entity1 has to do on her end of the deal is to pay fees for insurance and taxes , take part in local literary readings and promise to live in the house for at least two years			1
the - 29 - year - old originally from @entity49 was selected by judges from a host of other applicants for the house on the strength of her poetry that " breaks through " and addresses " some of the more frightening " aspects of racism			2
while delighted , she says she is still pinching herself to make sure she 's not dreaming and has actually won a new home			0
" i saw this come up and i was a little bit skeptical as it seemed a bit too crazy that they were giving away free houses , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" ( but ) i love the house and i 'm very excited to actually get there and start living there			0
laying the foundations write a @entity24 is the brainchild of @entity72 , a writer and creative director at advertising agency @entity75 , and @entity76 , a writer and journalist originally from @entity78 , who have been collaborating on the idea since 2012			0
the pair hope not only to improve @entity8 's neighborhoods by filling out boarded up properties but to change outside perceptions of life in the city as well			1
" as a freelance writer i 've found it to be a great place as there is so much space to cover things			0
you 're not living in a city like @entity78 that has so many journalists in every area , " @entity76 said			0
a problem that has arisen due to the comparative lack of storytellers in @entity8 , @entity76 believes , is that negative stereotypes about life in the city have been allowed to flourish			1
@entity1 concurs and points out that @entity8 has become a metaphor for @entity12 industrial decline -- which she describes as wholly unfair			1
while @entity75 has certainly suffered its fair share of hardship , including filing for bankruptcy in 2013 , both @entity1 and @entity76 say countering the simplistic narrative of a city in ruins is important in providing perspective			2
" in @entity8 there are so many stories that need to be told			2
it does n't matter whether you end up telling them through poetry or fiction ... there 's a lot of inspiring people here , " @entity76 said			0
moving on up tackling the many misconceptions surrounding @entity8 and focusing on growing as a writer is for the months and years ahead , however			2
for now , @entity1 is preparing to move in to her new home on november 1 and is excited to explore her new community			2
she said she was intrigued by the eclectic cultural mix of the neighborhood 's @entity128 and @entity129 immigrant communities when she visited in september as well as the visual art installations that dot the landscape			0
the house itself is compact , with one bedroom and one bathroom , and was in a state of disrepair when bought at auction for just $ 1,000 earlier this year			1
it has since been renovated by local companies employing young apprentices from across @entity8 thanks to a $ 30,000 donation from @entity75 and $ 33,000 raised on the crowdfunding site @entity145			1
write a @entity24 's initial success and the positive coverage it has received has also helped attract more donations and sponsors to buy up other houses in the coming months			0
" we 're planning to do three houses next year , " @entity76 said			0
" we already own one and are talking about picking up two more			0
" she added that since the original crowdfunding campaign " we have attracted grants ... and we 've actually received $ 100,000 from the @entity155 ( an organization that seeks to promote journalism and the arts )			0
" " @entity159 was a great way to make it public and get attention by getting little donations			0
but the housing renovations are expensive and i believe we 'll be getting a mix of different grants and funding in the future			0
