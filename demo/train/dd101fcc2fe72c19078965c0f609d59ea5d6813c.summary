here 's the hard reality about illegal immigration : politicians can change policies			1
but the issue will not go away until @entity8 change their behavior			2
trial lawyers have a favorite saying : " when you have the facts on your side , you pound the facts into the table			0
when you have the law on your side , you pound the law into the table			0
when neither the facts nor the law are on your side , you pound the table ! " in november , when president @entity23 announced that he would take executive actions to re-prioritize the enforcement of immigration laws so that some illegal immigrants could obtain a three - year delay in their deportation proceedings and a temporary work permit , critics had neither the facts nor the law on their side			1
so they pounded the table			0
@entity35 lawmakers and conservative commentators charged that @entity23 was pushing an " unlawful amnesty " that threatened the republic			1
yet most of the law professors and legal experts who weighed in , even the conservatives , acknowledged that @entity23 was acting within the power of the presidency			1
critics did n't seem to have a legal leg to stand on			0
that is , until this week			0
in @entity48 , a federal judge temporarily blocked @entity23 's executive action and cleared the way for a lawsuit against the administration brought by that state and 25 others			1
@entity8 district judge @entity55 , a @entity56 appointee with a history of taking conservative positions on immigration issues , bought the plaintiffs ' argument that @entity23 's executive actions would unfairly result in " direct damages " to the states			1
@entity55 claimed that @entity23 's executive action could result in " bestowing multiple and otherwise unobtainable benefits " on those illegal immigrants who qualify for deferred action			1
this would include the undocumented parents of @entity8 - born children			0
yet , most so - called " benefits " — driver 's licenses , college aid , medical care — come not from the federal government but from the states , and at their discretion			1
in all , @entity55 's ruling went on for 123 pages			1
still , he ducked the central question : whether the president had exceeded the authority granted to the office under the @entity85			0
instead , the judge ruled that the administration had not complied with the @entity88 , which calls for a longer notification and comment period from lawmakers and the public before taking action			1
imagine if there had been a comment period before acting in the war on terror			0
buildings would be smoldering , and we 'd still be talking			0
the @entity100 -- while saying that it would abide by the judge 's ruling — also reiterated that the president was " well within his legal authority " to set enforcement priorities			1
the @entity107 intends to appeal the decision			0
this case could end up before the @entity110 , where most of the justices have smiled on expanding executive power			1
the coalition of states that brought the lawsuit — which is led by @entity48 — includes @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			2
it figures that , when there 's a mess , @entity48 will be in the middle of it			2
i lived there for five years — about a decade ago — while writing for the @entity148			0
during my time in the @entity48 , i often heard people complain about illegal immigrants			0
but i never heard them say a word about the employers who hire them to do jobs that @entity158 wo n't do such as tarring roofs in 100 - degree weather or cleaning windows on skyscrapers			0
the folks doing the hiring are always the root of the problem , but — in a red state like @entity48 — you ca n't get republicans to say that			2
it 's safer for politicians to pick on people who do n't vote than to risk antagonizing those who not only vote but also contribute money to campaigns			2
the states that brought this lawsuit are worried that , if @entity23 allows some illegal immigrants to remain in this country for three years , they 'll have to pick up the tab for providing services			1
where was this concern over the many years that these states were standing on the positive side of the ledger by benefiting from illegal immigrant labor — so much so that they turned a blind eye to the employers and businesses using it ? how did these 26 states wind up with so many illegal immigrants ? the undocumented did n't go there for the scenery			2
they went because someone was waiting there to offer them a job			0
we never talk about that , or do anything about it			0
and so , no matter what courts decide or politicians decree , the problem of illegal immigration will never go away			1
that 's the truth that needs to be pounded into the table .			2
