-- if the trajectory of @entity4 daily life keeps heading in its current direction , the country may end up with only two dominant occupations : -- carrying stuff in boxes to people 's houses			1
-- and keeping a watchful eye on those same people so they do n't hurt each other or steal things when they do leave their homes			1
for all the talk about how e-commerce is outpacing the performance of traditional retail sales in brick - and - mortar stores , the men and women who could gain the most from the boom in online merchandising are not web designers or those who come up with clever new shopping apps , but workers who perform one of the oldest jobs in the world : lugging packages from the curb to someone 's front door			1
it 's one task that ca n't be accomplished in cyberspace			1
during the 2013 holiday season , according to the @entity38 , retail stores drew only about half of the foot traffic that they did three years earlier			2
and during the peak holiday shopping period , online sales increased by more than double the rate of sales at traditional stores			1
for every shopper who does n't leave a store carrying a bag full of merchandise , but instead places orders online , there 's someone who has to bring those items to the residence			1
and in the long run , the major beneficiaries of this shift in habits could very well turn out to be the people who undertake a decidedly low - technology endeavor : grabbing a box from the back of a truck and walking with it to a house			1
you can already see the effects of this in statistics kept by the @entity70			0
it 's no secret that , in our era of e-mails and texts , the number of first - class letters delivered by the post office has plummeted			1
as recently as 2008 , the @entity70 reported that it was delivering 90.7 billion letters annually			0
by last year , that number was down to 65.8 billion			0
but the @entity70 's numbers for delivering packages , as opposed to letters , have actually gone up			2
in 2008 , it delivered 3.3			0
billion packages ; that had grown to 3.7 billion packages by last year			0
@entity88 says it delivers 16.3 million packages and documents worldwide every day -- 4.1 billion a year			0
some time - honored , pre-digital - era manufacturing firms have figured out a way to make the lug - the - package - to - the - house business model work for them , too			0
@entity100 , according to the @entity38 , " is among the companies profiting from new digital habits			0
it bought several makers of corrugated cardboard boxes , which now fill with goods shipped by online retailers like @entity106			2
the @entity108 - based paper company said it has a 35 percent market share			0
" but if carrying boxes is one line of work that has legs , another -- just as old - line -- may become even more in demand as the years go by			2
we can tell ourselves that our worlds are full of social media friends and amiable followers , yet the growth in industries devoted to protecting us from each other , both on the streets and in the electronic ether , betrays a certain distrust in the purportedly benign intentions of our fellow citizens			1
it 's not just the checkpoints at airports , and surveillance cameras on street corners , and cybercrime - fighting software offered by manufacturers ; @entity138 and @entity139 , writing in the @entity137 , noted , " another dubious first for @entity4 : we now employ as many private security guards as high school teachers -- over one million of them , or nearly double their number in 1980			1
... what is happening in @entity4 today is both unprecedented in our history , and virtually unique among @entity147 democratic nations			1
the share of our labor force devoted to guard labor has risen fivefold since 1890			0
" this caution on the part of both citizens and industry may be warranted , but @entity138 and @entity139 , reflecting on the melancholy underlying message of this , point out what philosopher @entity157 wrote in 1848 : " it is lamentable to think how a great proportion of all efforts and talents in the world are employed in merely neutralizing one another			0
" neutralizing one another or , more cheerily , showing up bearing boxes			0
the @entity70 reports that its letter carriers and package - deliverers drive 4 million miles every day			0
@entity88 operates a delivery fleet consisting of 96,028 cars , vans , tractors and motorcycles , as well as 237 aircraft			2
as the inexorable shift to e-commerce becomes the standard way of shopping , those numbers can only be expected to increase			2
and the private - security industry ? that other growth field ? there is an outside chance that it could eventually dwindle : if we should someday decide to put our faith in the sweet intentions and endless goodwill of our fellow citizens , both the ones we can see and the ones who invisibly make their way into our computers			1
until then , though , there is a multitude of home - security and break - in - alarm products for sale online			1
and a multitude of men and women hired to carry them to the double - locked front door .			0

@entity203 : @entity4 may end up with only two dominant occupations
@entity203 : one is carrying stuff to people 's homes , the other is protecting them
he says with the rise of online shopping , more people need delivery *services*
@entity203 : the other growth field is private security ; we employ more guards now
