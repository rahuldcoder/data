@entity0 -- a 14 - year - old accused of ruthless killings on behalf of a @entity7 drug cartel boss is a @entity8 citizen , a @entity3 spokeswoman said monday			1
@entity9 would not provide any further information			1
" we have confirmed the boy 's @entity8 citizenship but ca n't say anything more about the boy 's situation in the absence of a ( provisional arrest warrant ) signed by at least one of the parents , " @entity9 said			1
earlier , @entity9 said that the boy , once his citizenship was confirmed , would be given " all appropriate consular assistance , just like we would for any @entity8 citizen arrested and incarcerated overseas			1
" assistance would include prison visits , information on local attorneys and checks on his welfare , she said			2
the teen -- reportedly carrying a birth certificate issued in @entity33 -- and two of his sisters were detained thursday at an airport in central @entity0 after an anonymous tip alerted authorities he was heading to @entity39 , @entity0 , local media reported			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity7 attorney general 's office said authorities detained the 14 - year - old thursday evening on suspicion of working as a drug - cartel hit man , but declined to provide details			1
but the boy faced a battery of questions from reporters after he was detained , answering questions point - blank as camera flashes lit his face			2
" i slit their throats , " he said , describing what he said was the killing of four people			1
the teen told reporters after his capture thursday night that he was an orphan who joined the @entity62 drug cartel when he was 12			1
he said @entity63 , one of the group 's alleged leaders , threatened him			2
" i either work or he 'll kill me , " the 14 - year - old said			1
with his hands shoved into the pockets of his cargo pants , the 14 - year - old told reporters that he was paid weekly in dollars and pesos			0
but in answering questions about whether he knew what he was doing when he allegedly participated in the killings , the teen said he was under the influence of drugs and unaware of his actions			0
" no , i did n't know , " he said			0
troops standing beside the teen while the youth was interviewed wore masks to hide their faces -- a common sight in @entity0 , where clashes between authorities and cartels have intensified since president @entity88 announced a crackdown shortly after he took office in 2006			0
but the teen 's face was clearly visible			1
@entity93 , director of @entity0 's @entity94 , said late friday that authorities should not have given television cameras and newspaper photographers access to the 14 - year - old			0
" it was completely inappropriate , the form of presenting him in front of the media , " he said			0
" everyone has the right to be presumed innocent , " he said			0
" also , it could put his life at serious risk			0
we have to remember that this is a fight between criminal organizations			0
" @entity1 's @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report .			0
