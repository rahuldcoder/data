-- @entity1 released the first color images of the surface of @entity4 from its new rover curiosity on tuesday , showing a dusty , tan desert dominated by the rim of the crater where the craft landed			1
the image -- shot at an angle by a camera on @entity5 's still - stowed robotic arm -- shows the sandy plain ahead of the rover and the northern rim of @entity17 , where the rover touched down early monday			1
the image was shot through a retractable , transparent dust shield over the lens , making it " kind of murky , " said @entity22 , a senior scientist for the camera 's builder , @entity23			1
controllers wanted to make sure the camera still functioned after @entity5 's 352 - million - mile voyage and harrowing landing early monday , @entity22 told reporters at @entity1 's @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30			1
read more on the @entity31 : is all this necessary ? " this was basically a focus test , " he said , adding , " it works			0
we ca n't wait to open it and see what else we can see			0
" the crater rim seen in the photo is more than 20 km ( 12.5 miles ) from the rover , @entity22 said			2
other images beamed back in the first day and a half since the landing include 297 low - resolution color images of the final minutes of its descent			0
the pictures , posted on the space agency 's website , show some of the gyrations @entity5 went through beneath its parachute and the dust kicked up as it touched down			1
the $ 2.6 billion rover made its dramatic arrival on @entity4 terrain in a spectacle popularly known as the " seven minutes of terror			1
" the landing involve a sky crane and the world 's largest supersonic parachute , which allowed the spacecraft carrying @entity5 to target the landing area that scientists had meticulously chosen			1
the probe was in " great shape " 36 hours after landing as @entity1 starts to activate the rover 's systems , mission manager @entity72 said tuesday afternoon			1
but he noted that adjustments need to be made to at least two systems			0

" the antenna mechanism is in fine shape , but it was not quite pointed accurately enough at the @entity84 for us to get the telecom signal that we wanted , " @entity72 said			0
and the @entity90 " did not work correctly " the second time the team tried to test its sensors , leading the researchers behind that project to go back and re-check the unit 's data files			1
" i would say that it does not appear to be significant at this time , " @entity72 said			0
" but these guys are off working it , and it 's their baby			0
let 's let them think about it for a while			0
" the unit , known as the @entity90 , monitors ground and air temperatures , humidity , atmospheric pressure and ultraviolet light			0
despite the glitches , @entity72 said controllers remain in high spirits			0
" these are the days that people worked five and 10 years for , going on right now , " he said			0
take our @entity4 quiz curiosity is essentially a car - sized mobile science laboratory , packing 17 cameras , a laser that can survey the composition of rocks from a distance and instruments that can analyze samples from soil or rocks			2
the aim is to determine whether @entity4 ever had an environment capable of supporting life			2
its prime target is the 18,000 - foot ( 5,500 - meter ) peak at the center of @entity17 , @entity136			2
the stratified composition of the mountain could give scientists a layer - by - layer look at the history of the planet			0
@entity5 's landing site is about 12 km ( 7.5 miles ) from the foot of the mountain , @entity1 project scientist @entity143 said			1
the rover is supposed to last for two years on @entity4 , but it may operate longer -- after all , @entity148 , which arrived on @entity4 in 2004 , were each only supposed to last 90 @entity4 days			2
spirit stopped communicating with @entity1 in 2010 after getting stuck in sand , and @entity151 is still going .			2

new : controllers to tweak antenna , work on sensor glitch , mission manager says

" the image *sequence* received so far indicates @entity5 had , as expected , a very *exciting* ride , " @entity1 says
