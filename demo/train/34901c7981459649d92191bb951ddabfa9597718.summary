@entity0 -- a @entity4 woman has been convicted of human trafficking and other charges for bringing two @entity8 women to the @entity9 and forcing them to work in her lavish home like slaves , the @entity2 said monday			0
@entity12 , 41 , was convicted on eight counts by a federal jury late last week : two counts each of forced labor , trafficking for forced labor and making false statements in an application to become a @entity9 citizen , and one count each of document servitude and alien harboring			1
" the evidence showed that this was a case of modern - day slavery hidden within an expensive home in an upscale neighborhood , " said @entity24 , @entity9 attorney for the @entity25			1
@entity12 recruited her first victim , identified as " @entity31 , " in 2001 , according to prosecutors			1

the second victim , identified as " @entity38 , " traveled to the @entity9 in 2004 , when she was 20 , also on a fake passport			0
both women were promised a better life and told that @entity12 would help further their educations			1
but upon arriving in the @entity9 , they discovered a decidedly darker reality			0
@entity12 beat the women for any perceived infraction -- not cleaning well , not responding quickly enough to the cries of her child , talking back -- with whatever weapon was available : shoes , a large wooden spoon , electric cords and her hands , evidence showed			1
testimony also revealed that @entity12 forced the women to sleep on the floor or couch and bathe with a bucket			1
they were not allowed to eat what they cooked , and @entity12 sometimes gave the women spoiled food , evidence showed			1
prosecutors said @entity12 never paid the women for their years of work and made them dependent on her for all their basic necessities			1
attempts to contact @entity12 's attorney were unsuccessful monday			1

both women testified during the one - week trial			2
@entity12 , who holds both @entity9 and @entity8 citizenship , is scheduled to be sentenced august 24			2

around the world , as estimated 12.3 million adults and children -- 56 % of whom are women and girls -- are the victims of forced labor , bonded labor and sex slavery , according to @entity108			2
the trade puts approximately $ 32 billion into the pockets of traffickers each year			0
@entity95 , who is helping prosecute @entity12 's case , said she is sure similar cases exist in @entity0 and elsewhere in the @entity9			1
" unfortunately , yes , " she said			0
