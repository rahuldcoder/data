-- like many people , i 've been riveted by the @entity4 trial			1
i call it " the @entity4 trial " because that 's what it is , but the more i watch , the more i wonder : should it be renamed " the @entity12 trial ? " i 'm not just talking about some of the media 's tabloid - like focus on @entity12 's background , his personal history , his school records and -- outside the courtroom -- the toxicology report			1
i 'm talking about an aspect of the case that never comes up in the media coverage , one that i would argue is key			0
this murder trial , in and out of the courtroom , has been boiled down to one question : was @entity4 in fear for his life and thus justified in defending himself by shooting and killing @entity12 ? it has been framed this way -- in terms of @entity4 's mortal fear -- since the shooting in 2012			1
@entity4 's assumptions led to death , prosecutor argues some people have forgotten that @entity4 was not even arrested initially			2
it took more than a month for the special prosecutor to bring the second - degree murder charge			0
and if not for mass protests across the country , he might not be the defendant in a murder trial at all			0
the question that has not surfaced in the courtroom -- the elephant in the room -- is this : did @entity12 fear for his life after being followed and confronted by a stranger while going to the store to buy candy and a soft drink ? was he , @entity12 , justified in standing his ground and defending himself when this stranger , an apparent stalker , approached him in a threatening manner ? @entity4 did n't identify himself and never said he was part of the neighborhood watch group			1
think about it : we 're told over and over that if @entity4 was afraid of @entity12 , according to @entity66 law , he had the right to put a bullet in the chamber of his concealed handgun , get out of his car after being told not to by the 911 dispatcher and follow and confront @entity12 and shoot him to death			1
at the same time , we are told that @entity12 , who had far greater reason to fear @entity4 , practically and for reasons of @entity76 history , did not have the right to confront his stalker , stand his ground and defend himself , including by using his fists			1
we are told that this was entirely unjustified and by doing so , @entity12 justified his own execution			1
running updates from the @entity4 trial the phrases " stand your ground " and " self - defense " have been repeated endlessly by anchors , pundits , analysts and experts , but rarely applied to @entity12			1
how could this be ? why is this other question ignored ? surely it will come up as we approach the trial , i thought			2
what 's going on here ? how can the @entity66 law apply only to @entity4 and not to @entity12 ? i remembered the sharp , sometimes bitter commentary provoked by @entity103 's 1989 film " @entity106 , " particularly in reaction to its climactic scenes , when the police murder a black teenager and @entity103 's character throws a trash can through the window of the white - owned pizza place			2
years after the movie came out , @entity103 told an interviewer , " white people still ask me why @entity116 threw the can through the window			0
... twenty years later , they 're still asking me that			0
" " no black person ever , in 20 years , no person of color has ever asked me why , " he said			0
this speak volumes about race and power relations in this country			0
opinion : @entity4 trial - it 's about race here 's what i think : assuming @entity12 did engage @entity4 physically , perhaps if the teen had hit back a little bit harder , perhaps if he had been able to prevent @entity4 from grabbing his concealed and loaded gun and perhaps if witnesses had come to @entity12 's aid , then maybe he would be alive today			1
one thing i feel sure of is that if @entity12 , in fear for his life , had used @entity4 's own gun to shoot and possibly kill his attacker , when the police arrived on the scene , they would not have failed to charge him with murder			2
why has n't the prosecution team used @entity66 law to argue strongly for @entity12 's right of self - defense , his right to stand his ground against a stalker ? why not turn the tables on @entity4 's exclusive claim to that argument ? it will be interesting to see whether this question even gets posed for the jury at all			1
it certainly will be front and center as this case is tried by the jury of history			0
and future generations will likely puzzle over how the term " racial profiling " could have been banned by the judge before the trial even began			0
this country 's racial history , the list of names , like @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and other victims of " deadly force " by the policeâ € ” these represent an even bigger @entity182			0
they may have been ruled irrelevant in the courtroom , but they are certainly relevant to those who seek justice in this society			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity191 : @entity4 trial should be renamed the @entity12 trial
he says question not raised : was n't @entity12 the one standing his ground , facing a stalker ?
we 're told that by defending himself , @entity12 justified his own execution , he says
@entity191 : prosecution should use stand - your - ground on @entity12 's *behalf* ; it 's about race , justice
