@entity1 president @entity0 said friday that a ceasefire due to go into effect over the weekend between @entity1 forces and @entity7 separatists in eastern @entity1 is in " big danger			1
" fighting continued ahead of the cessation of the bitter 10 - month - long conflict that has killed more than 5,000 people and strained @entity14 relations			1
the peace plan hammered out thursday during marathon four - way talks in @entity18 , @entity19 , had raised hopes of an end to the fighting			1
but @entity0 said that after the agreement reached by the leaders of @entity1 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , the offensive against @entity1 troops by @entity7 separatists had intensified			1
" this is not just an attack on @entity1 civilians , this is an attack of the @entity18 results , " he said in @entity30 , adding the peace plan is in " big danger			1
" the ceasefire agreement comes with many questions over how it will be implemented and whether it will stick			1
the first test will be whether the guns fall silent when the ceasefire comes into force at midnight local time saturday to sunday			1
both sides are expected to start pulling back their heavy weapons from the front lines as of monday , creating a buffer zone at least 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) wide			2
the @entity50 , which already has a monitoring mission in @entity1 , has been given the challenging task of overseeing the process			1
" we need to have an effective ceasefire , " said @entity50 secretary general @entity54 , at a media briefing			1
" so i 'm already concerned that we are seeing this morning a continuation of hostilities			1
" the @entity50 hopes to see a reduction in hostilities between now and the start of the ceasefire , he said			1
but reports from eastern @entity1 -- where separatist soldiers told @entity2 's @entity66 on thursday that they were highly skeptical of the peace plan -- suggest otherwise			1
eight @entity1 soldiers have died and 34 have been injured in the past 24 hours , the @entity68 said friday morning			1
there were 40 incidents of militants opening fire and shelling in the conflict area overnight , including 25 in the @entity78 area , it said			2
what will happen to the strategically important , government - controlled town of @entity78 , under siege by separatist forces for weeks , is one of the big unanswered questions			1
thousands of @entity1 soldiers remain there , almost surrounded , and it 's unclear who will ultimately control the town when the ceasefire comes into effect			1
the water began running thursday night for the first time in a week at the @entity94 home in @entity95			2
a bath was quickly drawn so the three children could clean up			2
the kids ' mother went to another room to get a towel and the first shell hit , wiping out the bathroom but leaving the parents ' bedroom -- even its windows -- intact			2
@entity107 , 14 ; @entity108 , 7 ; and @entity109 , 2 1/2 , were dead			2
" what ceasefire ? i curse every day those who killed my children , and all those of the country			2
people who want to live peacefully , " @entity116 told @entity2 , according to a translator			0
" we lived , grew up , took our children to school			0
" @entity123 said in a " crisis update " from one of its doctors in @entity95 that between five and 20 victims are brought to their facility each day			0
on one occasion , there were 60 victims			0
but on three days , there was no water with which to sterilize the equipment , so only urgent care was administered			0
despite the uncertainties over the deal , all those at the @entity18 talks said it was a better alternative than simply allowing the escalating violence to continue			0
" we had just two options : bad , and worse			0
so we decided at this particular period of time to get the bad option			0
probably this option will save the lives of @entity1 soldiers , and i hope this option will save lives of @entity1 civilians , of innocent people , who are under a constant shelling of @entity25 - led terrorists , " @entity1 prime minister @entity147 told @entity2 's @entity148 in @entity30			1
" it 's better to have this new deal rather than not to have ( it )			0
but we do not trust any words or any papers			0
we are to trust only actions and deeds , " he said			0
the @entity164 issued a statement with a tone of guarded optimism and urged all parties to take " immediate , concrete steps " to fulfill their commitments			0
" heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the conflict zone , and @entity25 must end its support for the separatists and withdraw its soldiers and military equipment from eastern @entity1 , " the statement said			1
while the @entity1 forces have to pull back their heavy weapons from the front line as it stands saturday night , the separatist forces must pull back theirs from the front line as it was on september 19 , when a previous peace agreement was signed in @entity18			1
that swiftly disintegrated amid continued violence			0
the new ceasefire proposal represents a territorial gain for the separatists , who control parts of the @entity194 and @entity195 regions			2
@entity26 chancellor @entity198 , speaking after the talks wrapped up alongside @entity27 president @entity197 , said that what had been achieved gave " a glimmer of hope " but that big hurdles still lay ahead			2
@entity206 leaders who met in @entity207 later thursday " did not discuss any new sanctions against @entity25 , " @entity204 president @entity203 told reporters in the @entity211 capital			0
@entity203 said that the @entity206 wants " to encourage " @entity25 to implement the new @entity18 agreement , but he also advised caution in light of how the first @entity18 agreement unraveled			0
@entity217 spokesman @entity216 told @entity25 's state - run @entity218 that while @entity25 had helped to bring about the @entity18 agreement , it was n't in its power to fulfill it			0
" we simply ca n't do this physically because @entity25 is not a participant in the conflict , " @entity216 said			0
@entity226 hopes that all of the points drawn up in the @entity18 deal will be fulfilled , he added			2
@entity25 has steadfastly denied accusations that it is sending forces and weapons into @entity1			1
but top @entity234 and @entity1 leaders have said there is n't any doubt that @entity25 is behind surging violence and separatists ' efforts to take over territory in eastern @entity1			1
@entity54 , the @entity50 secretary general , said his organization intends to put 350 monitors into eastern @entity1 to oversee the ceasefire and withdrawal process			1
under the terms of the @entity18 agreement , it can use radar , satellite and drone technology to help it			0
but he warned that unless the environment becomes less hostile , there are limits to where the @entity50 teams can go			1
details of the new agreement , which is similar in part to the september 19 deal , were released thursday , but it 's still unclear how elements of it will work			0
the points include : an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in parts of @entity194 and @entity195 starting at midnight on february 15			2
the withdrawal of all heavy weapons by both parties at equal distances in order to create a security zone width of at least 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) from each other for artillery systems and more for longer - range weapons			0
this process should begin no later than the next day after the ceasefire and should be over within 14 days			2
a dialogue on new local elections and the special status of the @entity194 and @entity195 regions will begin the day after the withdrawal			0
a law will be created to give amnesty to people involved in events in @entity195 and @entity194			0
both sides must ensure the release and exchange of all hostages and illegally held prisoners by no later than the fifth day after the withdrawal			0
withdrawal of all foreign troops and military equipment from @entity1 , including mercenaries , and the disarmament of militia groups			1
@entity2 's @entity299 , @entity66 , @entity300 , @entity301 and journalist @entity302 in @entity30 contributed to this report .			0
