@entity0 -- @entity2 took aim at the @entity5 press monday , calling the hacking of a murdered schoolgirl 's voice mail " cowardly and shocking			1
" the @entity5 actor also accused newspapers of using criminals as paparazzi and the @entity13 of hacking into his voice mail			2
the " @entity24 " star was testifying before a government - backed inquiry into press ethics sparked by public outrage at @entity20 's @entity22 newspaper			2
the best - selling sunday tabloid was shut down in july after the revelation that it had hacked into the voice mail of the murdered schoolgirl , @entity29			1
@entity31 's mother , @entity30 , explained earlier monday how the hacking had given her false hope that her missing daughter was still alive			1
she described her joy at finding voice mails had been deleted from her missing daughter 's phone : " she 's checked her voice mail , @entity41 ! she 's alive ! " in fact , the messages had been deleted by a private investigator working for @entity22 , @entity31 's father , @entity41 , told the inquiry panel			1
@entity31 's face fell as she recalled finding out it was the hacker , not her daughter , who had been checking the voice mail			2
@entity2 said he thought he had also been a victim of phone hacking			1
he said he could not think of any other source for a @entity13 story about his relationship with his then - girlfriend @entity55 being on the rocks because of his phone flirtation with a " plummy - voiced @entity58			2
" that story was later found false and libelous in court			0
@entity2 's accusation widens the scope of the @entity5 newspaper phone - hacking scandal , which has focused mostly on @entity20 - owned titles so far			1
the @entity13 is not a @entity20 newspaper			0
@entity2 also implied that the police were leaking stories about celebrities to the press , saying that when he called the police about his girlfriend being mugged , paparazzi showed up before the police			1
police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people , including celebrities , crime victims , politicians and members of the royal family , were targets of phone hacking by journalists in search of stories			1
the practice involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a pin to access messages remotely			0
most attention has focused on the now - defunct @entity22 , once the flagship sunday tabloid of @entity20 's @entity94 @entity5 publishing company			0
@entity20 and his son @entity95 have been called to testify before parliament over the scandal , and their company agreed last month to pay 2 million pounds ( $ 3.1 million ) in compensation to the @entity31 family			0
@entity20 personally donated 1 million pounds ( $ 1.57 million ) to charity as part of the deal , his company and the @entity106 announced last month			0
more than two dozen @entity94 employees used the services of a convicted phone hacker , the inquiry panel heard last week			0
" this fact alone suggests wide - ranging , illegal activity within the organization at the relevant time , " @entity111 , one of the lawyers serving as part of the @entity114 , said as the panel began hearing testimony			0
@entity121 has always insisted that the practice of phone hacking was not widespread			1
but @entity111 said november 14 that private investigator @entity125 's notebooks contained the names of at least 28 people who employed him on 2,266 occasions			2
four individuals -- whom @entity111 did not name -- were responsible for almost all the @entity125 commissions , @entity111 said			0
but the sheer number of names in @entity125 's files means the one @entity22 journalist jailed over phone hacking , @entity137 , " was not a rogue reporter , " @entity111 said			1
@entity125 and @entity137 went to prison in 2007 after admitting hacking into royal family staff messages			0
@entity1 's @entity141 contributed to this report .			0
