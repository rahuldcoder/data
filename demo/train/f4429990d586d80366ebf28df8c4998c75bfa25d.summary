-- with hundreds of millions of @entity2 owning mobile phones , citizens are becoming increasingly well connected			1
this is providing a powerful opportunity for citizens to access critical information about their parliaments and to report on human rights violations , corruption and poor service delivery			1
these interventions are amplifying the voices of marginalized communities and helping citizens to hold governments to account			1
for citizens to actively participate in democracy , it is critical that they are able to access information on parliamentary proceedings and elected representatives			1
@entity23 is contributing to this process			0
it has partnered with local organizations across @entity27 to build sites like @entity29 in @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity32 , which enable citizens to access information about parliamentary proceedings and their elected representatives , rate their mps and gain a better understanding about government 's inner workings			1
they 've taken this process one step further in @entity27			1
the @entity42 has created a platform where citizens can submit @entity45			2
a data repository has been created online , enabling journalists , analysts and campaigners to utilize this information to hold government to account and campaign for improved service delivery			1

during protests sparked by last year 's fuel crisis , where an increase in the price of fuel resulted in soaring commodity prices , this enabled citizens to exercise their rights against police forces			1
@entity77 fueled this crisis , with few citizens understanding the new fuel subsidy payment or oil revenue share in their country			2
a local organization called @entity84 aimed to address this by generating simple infographics which took citizens through these complex processes in a visual format			2
utilizing the power of social media , this sparked more informed debates and dialogue that contributed to restoring order			0
the team has since produced a whole series of images that breakdown the @entity62 budget by state and sector , enabling citizens to better understand the country 's budget and to utilize this information to ensure that allocated funds are translated into improved services			1
across the continent , platforms are being developed that enable citizens to use @entity113 from basic phones to report challenges in service delivery			1
in the impoverished @entity119 township in @entity120 , residents have submitted around 3,000 reports on issues like poor sanitation , electricity and transport to the @entity127 platform from their mobile phones , @entity130 and the web			1
remarkably , most of the issues have been resolved by the city council			0
read this : @entity2 innovation can take on the world in @entity139 , the brutal @entity138 conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands of people , leaving infrastructure and service delivery in dire straits			1
a @entity144 has been put in place but progress is limited			0
only a few health centers have been established , there 's a severe shortage of drugs , medical workers and equipment and corruption is commonplace			2
@entity154 has created a platform populated with information on health programs being implemented in the region and citizen journalists are able to submit reports , photographs and audio footage describing the real situation on the ground , whilst @entity165 established by @entity166 are utilizing a similar platform to report on corrupt practices and poor governance			1
the data collected is being used by the @entity171 to hold government to account and advocate for improved services			1
in many @entity2 countries , youth often feel excluded from the political process			1
as young people are the biggest consumers of technology , platforms are being developed that enable them to become more actively engaged			2
in @entity30 , @entity181 is utilizing an sms platform to encourage youth to vet their leaders according to policies and attributes instead of along tribal lines			0
the platform is also used to gauge political opinion			0
the feedback is collated into reports which are fed into government , giving youth a voice and allowing them to contribute to the development of policy			0
until 2009 , @entity199 -- one of the world 's largest slums and home to more than 250,000 people -- appeared only as a blank on online maps			2
this made it easy for government to ignore the needs of its citizens			0
@entity199 has equipped young activists with @entity213 - enabled phones and has supported them in creating a map of the region , part of a wider program that empowers youth to raise awareness of the challenges faced by their communities and advocate for change			0
read this : tech hub working on ' next big idea ' @entity226 has taken this process a step further in three districts			0
once youth have mapped their area , they populate the map with data on service delivery such as access to water points , clean water and hygiene facilities			0
local councilors and activists are utilizing this data to mobilize the involved communities to demand better services and advocate for change			0
technology applications can be developed anywhere and what 's exciting about many of these initiatives is that they 're being devised locally			2
technology innovation hubs are springing up across the continent			0
these state - of - the - art facilities enable technologists and social activists to access high - speed internet , events and mentoring , as well as creating a collaborative environment that galvanizes the tech community			0
this is beginning to have a significant effect on the number and quality of projects being developed locally			0
homegrown solutions are often most effective , as local communities are best able to understand the complex local needs , behaviors and nuances			0
some of these hubs such as @entity271 in @entity272 and @entity273 in @entity274 , @entity62 , have targeted programs to support transparency initiatives , thus catalyzing this process			0
undoubtedly , technology is n't a panacea for all social problems			0
and at times , such as when the technology utilized is n't locally available or where governments lack capacity to respond to issues being reported it can be entirely inappropriate			2
however , when combined with well devised programs , their power to reach the previously unreachable and to bring the voices of citizens closer to government makes them a significant contributor to the process of ensuring that government 's best serve the interests of their citizens			1
