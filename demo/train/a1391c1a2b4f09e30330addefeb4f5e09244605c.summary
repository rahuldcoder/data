-- the @entity3 forged a political agreement on monday to list the military wing of @entity6 as a terrorist organization , a @entity2 diplomat told @entity0			1
the @entity11 - backed @entity10 @entity9 group , which is a strong force in @entity10 politics , already is regarded as a terrorist organization by the @entity15 and @entity16			1
@entity6 leader acknowledges fighters ' presence in @entity21 town there had been political pressure to put the entire group on the terror list amid developments in @entity27 and @entity28			1
the designation would put asset freezes on @entity6 entities			0
" legal details need to be worked on in the coming days , " the diplomat said			0
the @entity27 cited evidence that @entity6 's military wing was involved in a terrorist attack last year that killed five @entity16 tourists and a @entity27 bus driver			1
in @entity28 this year , a court found a @entity6 member guilty of assisting in the planning of an attack on @entity16			2
lately , its fighters have sided with @entity21 president @entity44 in that country 's civil war			1
terrorism at a moment of transition the @entity3 agreed to target just the military component , the diplomat said			0
critics of such an approach say designating part of an entity is n't effective or practical			0
@entity16 justice minister @entity57 's spokeswoman called the decision " correct and just , " adding that it " puts an end to the wrong argument " that @entity6 's military activities are absolved by the group 's political status			1
" even if @entity6 is a political party , that does not whitewash and make legitimate their terrorist activities , " the spokeswoman said			0
positive reaction @entity15 secretary of state @entity71 said the move " will have a significant impact on @entity6 's ability to operate freely in @entity2 by enabling @entity2 law enforcement agencies to crack down on @entity6 's fundraising , logistical activity and terrorist plotting			1
" " as @entity6 has deepened its support for the brutal @entity44 regime and worked to expand its global reach through increased involvement in international criminal schemes and terrorist plots around the world , a growing number of governments are recognizing @entity6 as the dangerous and destabilizing terrorist organization that it is , " @entity71 said			2
" we call on other governments to follow the @entity3 's lead and to take steps to begin reining in @entity6 's terrorist and criminal activities			1
" @entity96 spokesman @entity95 cited @entity6 's support for the @entity44 regime in @entity21			1
" the @entity15 is proud to stand with the @entity3 on this front , " @entity95 said			1
@entity101 foreign secretary @entity100 said the agreement sends " a clear message " that the @entity3 " stands united against terrorism			0
" " it shows that no organization can carry out terrorist acts on @entity2 soil , such as the appalling attack in @entity27 one year ago , without facing the consequences			0
@entity2 nations have rightly come together in response , " he said			0
@entity15 sen. @entity114 , the @entity116 @entity115 who chairs the @entity117 , praised the @entity3 move , noting the @entity27 and @entity28 developments and @entity6 's role in @entity21 underscore its terrorist identity			1
" while i believe that the entire @entity6 organization unabashedly qualifies for a place on the @entity3 list of terrorist organizations , today 's decision will send a clear message to @entity6 , and to their primary backer @entity11 , that @entity2 is not a safe haven for terrorists , " @entity114 said			1
@entity131 : @entity6 not ' responsible political actor ' @entity6 was formed after @entity16 invaded @entity10 in 1982 to go after the @entity133 and has been accused of high - profile terror attacks over the years			2
opinion : time for @entity136 to make @entity6 statement " @entity6 first gained notoriety in 1983 after it bombed the @entity139 in @entity140 -- an attack that killed 63 people			0
shortly thereafter , @entity6 bombed the @entity15 and @entity147 @entity146 in @entity140 , killing 241 @entity15 and 58 @entity147 service members with one of the largest explosive devices ever detonated during a terrorist attack , " @entity131 , president @entity143 's former national security adviser , wrote in a @entity145 column this year			1
" throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the group conducted kidnappings and airplane hijackings , two bombings in @entity156 , several in @entity157 and an attempted bombing in @entity159			0
in 1996 , it assisted in the @entity161 attack in @entity162 , which killed 19 @entity15			0
thanks to this bloody record , in 1997 @entity6 was among the first groups added to the @entity167 's list of foreign terrorist organizations			2
" @entity131 said the group has tried to portray itself as a political entity focused on social services and defending the country			0
" but it is an illusion to speak of @entity6 as a responsible political actor			0
@entity6 remains a terrorist organization and a destabilizing force across the @entity179 , " he said			0
renewed @entity16 - @entity181 talks planned the latest @entity3 move comes amid two diplomatic developments last week : its own intention to ban funding to @entity16 entities in the @entity187 and @entity188 , and serious diplomatic wrangling over peace in the @entity179			1
@entity71 is working to bring @entity16 and @entity181 together for peace talks			1
opinion : @entity2 , name @entity6 in terror @entity3 foreign policy chief @entity194 noted that the @entity3 published a document reiterating " the long - held position that bilateral agreements with @entity16 do not cover the territory that came under @entity16 's administration in june 1967			1
" the move prompted criticism out of @entity16 and from some @entity15 lawmakers , who called it " counterproductive			2
" she said the " specific provisions " of the guidelines covering @entity16 - @entity3 " funding instruments " wo n't be implemented before january 1			2
" this is meant to clarify the @entity3 's position in advance of negotiations of agreements with @entity16 during the forthcoming financial perspective commencing in 2014			1
in no way will this prejudge the outcome of peace negotiations between @entity16 and @entity181			2
