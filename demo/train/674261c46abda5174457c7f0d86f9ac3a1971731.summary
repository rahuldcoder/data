an estimated 6 million @entity0 died at the hands of the @entity2 and their allies during the @entity4			0
hundreds of thousands more suffered , but somehow survived , in concentration camps			2
and some escaped , savoring freedom they otherwise never would have known			0
then there 's @entity9 , who was a decorated @entity10 soldier , former judge and , despite being raised a @entity13 and marrying someone of that faith , a " full - blooded jew " in the eyes of the @entity17 regime			1
according to a groundbreaking report , @entity9 was granted a reprieve despite this designation thanks to none other than @entity22			2
@entity23 , editor of the @entity24 from @entity26 newspaper , found the august 27 , 1940 , note from the @entity28 ( the infamous @entity17 secret police ) that saved @entity9 -- albeit temporarily			1
the order was revoked the next year , and @entity9 spent years doing hard labor in @entity17 concentration camps and work sites			1
still , given @entity22 and his colleagues ' extreme views and actions on @entity0 , even the temporary amnesty granted in the letter that @entity23 unearthed in a file kept by the @entity28 in @entity39 about @entity9 is extraordinary			2
@entity41 man reintroduces his cousin : @entity43 written by the notorious @entity46 figure @entity45 , the note calls for saving and protecting @entity9 " as per the @entity48 's wishes , " referring to @entity22 , who had led @entity26 since 1933			1
the letter , a copy of which is posted on the @entity24 from @entity26 's website , also states that @entity9 should not be inconvenienced " in any way whatsoever			1
" @entity22 and @entity9 had crossed paths before , serving in the same infantry unit during @entity10 in fact , for a short time @entity9 had been @entity22 's commander -- though the @entity24 from @entity26 said @entity9 , whose now 86 - year - old daughter was interviewed for their story , did n't personally know @entity22 and their fellow comrades described the future @entity17 leader as quiet , with no friends in the regiment			1
but @entity9 himself was close to many of his fellow veterans , including @entity67 , according to daughter @entity68			0
and @entity67 , who became a top aide to @entity22 from 1934 to 1939 before becoming @entity26 's consul in @entity71 through 1941 , helped connect @entity9 to @entity72 , the head of the @entity73 during @entity22 's reign			1
@entity9 , who was forced to retire as a judge in 1936 -- the same year he was beaten up by special police in front of his home -- had pleaded for leniency before			2
according to the @entity24 , he had petitioned @entity22 to make an exception because his daughter @entity81 would be considered a " first - degree half - breed " under @entity17 doctrine			1
highlighting his patriotism and @entity86 upbringing , @entity9 wrote , " for us , it is kind of spiritual death to now be branded as @entity0 and exposed to general attempt			0
" that appeal was denied , though the @entity9 family was able to move to a then @entity26 - speaking part of @entity94 for the next several years			2
in that time , @entity9 still got part of his military pension and his passport was n't stamped with a red j to brand him as @entity24 , the @entity24 reported			2
but after a pact with @entity94 that ceded that area to the @entity17 regime and the family 's attempts to flee to @entity41 and @entity104 failed , they landed back in @entity26 in 1940			1
@entity105 : finding a place for @entity107 the reprieve , credited to the fuhrer , came in the summer of that year			0
but in 1941 , @entity9 submitted the letter of protection , only to have it swiped away			0
the special order revoked , he landed soon thereafter in a concentration camp , and then began working for a timber processing company helping build barracks for @entity17 soldiers			1
" the slave workers were forced to live outdoors and were treated terribly , and of course they were watched by members of the @entity46 , " said @entity68 of her father , who besides being a soldier , judge and " sportsman , " had once been a concert violinist			0
" had he not been as fit as he was , he would never have survived			0
" the name @entity9 is well established in @entity26 20th - century history			0
a man also named @entity9 was one of @entity26 's ace fighter pilots during @entity10 , before being killed in action			1
@entity132 was once @entity22 's deputy , before flying to @entity133 on an alleged peace mission in 1941 that instead ended with him becoming a prisoner of war			1
@entity9 , though , was a prisoner of a very different sort through the early 1940s when @entity17 authorities deemed him " a jew like no other			0
" when the war ended and he gained his freedom , according to the @entity24 report , @entity9 was asked to become a judge yet again			1
he turned down the offer			0
a year later , @entity9 launched a new career and gained new prominence as a railway executive			0
by then , he 'd rejoined his wife and daughter			0
but not all his family : his sister @entity151 was killed in 1942 in the @entity153 concentration camp .			0

the @entity24 from @entity26 newspaper unearths internal @entity17 files on @entity9
@entity9 served in @entity22 's infantry unit in @entity10 but did n't know him , then was a judge
a 1940 order saved @entity9 , despite his @entity24 *heritage* , " per the @entity48 's wishes "
the order was revoked the next year , and @entity9 ended up in @entity17 concentration camps
