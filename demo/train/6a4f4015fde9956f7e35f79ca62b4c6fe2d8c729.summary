this year , officials here are seeing more and more people who need their help			2
@entity12 's slow recovery from the worst economic crisis in decades has left families across the country struggling to put food on their tables , whether or not they have a job			2
with an unemployment rate stuck above 9 percent and millions of people working part - time jobs because they can not find full - time positions , a record 45.8 million people -- one of every seven -- received food stamps from the government in may			1
demand for this kind of federal help has risen in all 50 states			2
@entity31 helps people who get food stamps and thousands of others who do not qualify for them			1
the center says the number of people it serves has risen dramatically in recent years -- from 82,683 in fiscal year 2008 to 172,627 people in 2011			2

@entity66 , black and @entity67			0
some came alone ; others brought their children or other family members			0
the economy is adding jobs , but not quickly enough to trickle down to the families the food bank serves			1
" any growth that the economy is feeling , the folks here at @entity31 are not feeling that yet , " said @entity79 , @entity31 's development director , during an interview in the center 's main warehouse in @entity83 , @entity84			0
" in fact , our numbers , from year to year have continued to trend upwards			0
so until we see a dramatic change in the economy , we 're going to continue to see a dramatic increase in folks who are coming here			1
" we 're expecting this winter to be the highest in history of @entity31 for folks needing food assistance			0
" even people who have jobs are having a hard time feeding their families			0
@entity100 ' mother had surgery a few months ago and is still recovering			0
standing in line , he said his family was referred to @entity31 " because it 's just me and my sister working , and right now it 's kind of hard for both of us to provide for younger brothers that we have			0

" our food banks across the country will tell you stories of people who have been donors who now need food assistance , who have lost their jobs or suffered some other kind of health care trauma , for example , in the family where they just do n't have enough to make ends meet , " @entity138 said			1
" people look at us as an emergency program , but more and more of our clients are coming to us on an ongoing basis			1
we are a regular part of how people get enough food to feed their families			1
" feeding @entity12 gets about 25 percent of its food from the federal government			1
@entity3 also gets government - subsidized food and relies on food drives , donations and state and federal emergency food grant programs			1
these organizations worry that the 12 - member congressional committee established as part of the deal to raise the debt limit and tasked with recommending an additional $ 1.5 trillion in federal deficit - reduction measures over the next decade could target programs that provide government - subsidized food to these organizations or others that help the needy			1
that could increase demand at these food banks and strain their resources			2
" we really need both government and charity to make sure people in this country have enough to eat , " @entity138 said .			2
