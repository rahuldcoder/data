-- @entity1 , the benchwarmer - turned - star starting point guard for the @entity3 , has powered his team to eight victories in nine games , and captured the imagination of people around the world			2
who could resist this story ? it 's role model , underdog and the unconventional star all rolled into one			0
a young kid who no one thought could make it in the @entity18 relentlessly pursued his dream , even if this meant sitting at the end of the bench or being relegated to the farm team			0
shuffled between @entity18 franchises , this @entity25 graduate eventually got his chance on one of the biggest stages in professional sports -- @entity31 -- and shined beyond imagination			0
the " @entity35 " story , as it is known in @entity34 , thrives because it shatters all stereotypes -- an @entity37 who can play in the @entity18 ; a scholar - athlete who is not just a token " racial diversity " player in a predominantly @entity42 ; a devout @entity44 , who puts @entity46 , family and team before himself in the " all - about - me " world of professional sports ; an @entity50 in the @entity18 -- until @entity1 , virtually an oxymoron			0
in @entity52 today , @entity35 also reigns			0
you ca n't find a @entity1 jersey on emptied store shelves ( even fake ones )			2
there are millions of microblog posts about the @entity34 phenomenon			0
many editorialists have claimed @entity1 as the " pride of @entity62 " ( @entity1 's grandmother 's homeland in @entity52 )			1
others in politically incorrect terms cite @entity1 as evidence that " yellow - skinned " people can excel on the global sports stage if given the chance			0
@entity52 state media extensively reported on " @entity35 , " or " @entity72 , " hailing @entity1 as the pride of @entity52			2
@entity1 's performance on the court unintentionally creates a bond between the @entity77 and @entity52 people			1
can his layups and intricate passing also help to improve @entity77 - @entity52 relations after leader - in - waiting @entity84 's visit to the @entity77 ? probably not			1
first , @entity1 is a @entity85 , born and raised in @entity86 , @entity87 , which is a bit awkward for @entity52			2
some @entity52 blog posts have taken shots at their own government by saying that had @entity1 grown up in @entity52 , he would have ended up as an illiterate and mediocre player for the @entity94 team , or by needling with the question , " why is the first @entity50 point guard in the @entity18 not a @entity52 national ? " @entity97 , the recent red carpet treatment of @entity52 's likely new president , @entity84 , in the @entity77 -- and the absence of any major agreements -- shows that the future of @entity77 - @entity52 relations will be difficult			1
whether it is the economy ( demands for @entity52 to act as a stakeholder in global economic recovery and trade fairly ) , security ( demands for transparency on its military buildup ) , global affairs ( complaints about @entity52 's veto of a @entity108 resolution on @entity109 ) , or society ( demands for better human rights in @entity52 ) , the @entity77 list of complaints about @entity52 is long			1
@entity121 is concerned that the new @entity77 " pivot " to @entity125 is window dressing for an effort to contain @entity52			2
and the @entity52 government is worried about pathological @entity77 overspending ( with skyrocketing debts borrowed from the @entity52 )			2
though they do n't say it in polite company , @entity121 's leaders see @entity77 complaints as those of a declining power , looking to block @entity52 's rise rather than finding ways to solve its own internal problems			1
and here perhaps is @entity35 's most poignant lesson for @entity77 - @entity52 relations : @entity52 treats well those who succeed , and it politely ignores all others			1
the recent full - armed embrace of @entity1 by the @entity52 state media -- his @entity145 identity notwithstanding -- is not unlike @entity52 's lauding of another @entity52 athlete who struck gold on her own : female tennis star @entity147			1
this tattooed rebel broke from the @entity52 state - backed tennis system in 2008 , seeking to choose her own coaches and tired of having 65 % of her winnings garnished by the government			0
termed by the @entity52 media as " @entity158 , " @entity147 was an embarrassment to the @entity52 government -- until she became the first @entity50 to win the @entity160 in 2011			0
after that , @entity52 state media praised her as " the empress of @entity165 tennis " and the " pride of @entity52			0
" what these sports stars teach us about politics is that complaining about @entity52 in hopes that it will kowtow to criticism is the wrong formula for @entity77 - @entity52 relations			1
competing and winning is the way to gain @entity52 's respect and cooperation			1
@entity35 will not tell us any more than this about @entity77 - @entity52 relations , which is fine			1
let 's enjoy this fairytale story while it lasts -- hopefully for @entity3 fans , through the @entity18 playoffs			0
follow @entity181 on @entity182 join the conversation on @entity184 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			0

@entity1 's success has been warmly embraced in @entity52
@entity187 says his gains are n't likely to make a difference in relations between @entity77 , @entity52
the relationship between the two nations is *strained* by many issues , he says
@entity187 : competing and winning is the best way for the @entity77 to gain @entity52 's cooperation
