-- what do you get when you cross thousands of plastic water bottles with an adventure - loving entrepreneur ? a boat , of course , designed to carry a team of scientists , adventurers and artists halfway around the world			1
sounds like an interesting proposition ? it clearly did to @entity15 , one of the youngest members of the famous banking dynasty , who has taken it upon himself to show the world how pervasive the global plastic waste problem has become			1
@entity21 wants the public to start viewing waste as a resource , particularly plastic			2
to underscore his message , he and collaborators designed a boat made almost entirely of plastic bottles and recycled plastic			1
later this month @entity15 and the crew will begin a planned 11,000 - mile ( 17,700 - kilometer ) voyage from the @entity34 city of @entity35 to @entity36 , @entity37			2
the crew hopes to accomplish the voyage in 100 days			2
almost four years in the making , the result of @entity15 's environmental vision is a 60 - foot catamaran - style boat named the @entity45			2
builders of the boat say it weighs in at 12 tons , with only 10 percent of the vessel made from new materials			1
constructed mainly from 12,500 reclaimed plastic water bottles designed to keep @entity45 afloat , the main frame is made from self - reinforcing polyethylene terephthalate ( @entity53 ) , a recyclable plastic material , and the sail has been hand - made using recycled @entity53 cloth			1
explore the technology of the @entity45 leaders of the voyage say the boat will be powered by renewable energy such as solar panels , wind turbines and bicycle generators			1
and crew members even plan to grow their own food aboard the boat with the help of a vertical garden attached to the mast			2
put all this together , @entity15 told @entity0 , and you get a boat which , its builders claim , is " infinitely recyclable			2
" " the idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere or into our oceans for that matter , so everything on the boat will be composted			2
even the vessel is going to end up being recycled when we finish , " @entity15 told @entity0 in a recent interview			1
the @entity45 's name is wordplay off the " @entity89 , " a balsa raft made famous by @entity92 @entity91 , who in 1947 sailed the vessel from @entity93 to the @entity94			1
learn more about the @entity89 's historic voyage two of @entity91 's grandchildren , @entity96 and @entity98 , will be aboard during various legs of the @entity45 voyage			0
the former is familiar with some of the terrain , having previously replicated his grandfather 's expedition using the original log books and diary used by @entity91 , and taking the opportunity to track changes in the @entity110 's environmental conditions			1
meet the @entity45 crew the @entity45 's journey will spotlight current environmental issues			0
en route to @entity37 , @entity45 will sail through the infamous @entity115 , now home to " @entity117 , " named due to the high levels of waste that have been drawn there by ocean currents			0
estimated to be around the size of @entity125 , this contaminated area of ocean has by some estimates more plastic than food for marine life			0
" i was astounded to hear that that there are places in our oceans where the ratio between plastic and plankton is 6 - to - 1 , " @entity15 told @entity0 , referring to the area			0
opinion : the reason for the @entity45 voyage expedition organizers say the boat will sail past the @entity143 en route to @entity37			1
its scheduled stops -- in places such as the @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 -- will be symbolic too , allowing the team to raise awareness of places that are particularly vulnerable to changing environmental conditions , such as rising sea levels			0
the journey is expected to take the crew through the " @entity156 " -- equatorial regions in the @entity159 , @entity110 and @entity160 oceans known for unpredictable weather patterns that include listless winds that can trap sailing vessels			1
the @entity165 recently pointed out that if the vessel breaks apart in the ocean it could send thousands of plastic bottles into the ocean			1
but @entity45 's skipper , @entity171 sailor @entity170 says she is confident the team will be able to navigate their way to their final destination			0
" we can not look at other boats for reference , but we would n't leave unless we 're completely confident we 'll make it , " she told @entity0			0
whether the boat completes its journey remains to be seen , but @entity15 is resolved about the importance of his mission , regardless of the outcome			0
" even if @entity45 gets damaged or does not make it , the message will still be there , " de @entity15 told @entity0			0
" the idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere , or into our oceans			0
" @entity0 will be keeping close track of the entire voyage , offering insights each week on the @entity45 's progress			0
do n't forget to check back each week to see how @entity45 is progressing .			0

boat made primarily from recycled plastic bottles set to sail @entity110
organizers of voyage aim to spotlight *dumping* of plastics , other pollutants
solar panels , wind turbines , *recumbent* bicycles will power the vessel
