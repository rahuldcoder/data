@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 officials have taken " very seriously " a plot to assassinate president @entity6 involving a @entity8 man who was arrested late last week in @entity1 , according to two @entity4 officials familiar with the matter			1
president @entity6 addresses the @entity1 parliament on monday			0
but the officials strongly cautioned that @entity4 presidents are frequent targets of threats that are all watched very carefully , and in this case the alleged plotter did not appear to get anywhere close to @entity6 during his @entity20 tour			2
the officials also noted that while @entity6 gets more threats than usual as the first @entity25 - @entity4 @entity4 president , this particular threat did not force any change to his schedule			2
" @entity36 , " said one of the officials familiar with the matter , who suggested the threat may be getting more attention because there has been a heavy international focus on @entity6 's first overseas trip since taking office			0
@entity38 officials declined to comment on the matter , citing a policy of not talking about security and threats around the president			0
@entity45 officials spoke only briefly about the case			0
" we work closely with the host country whenever there is an arrest , which we are doing in this matter , " @entity45 spokesman @entity47 said			0
the plot was first reported by the @entity55 newspaper @entity54 , which revealed that @entity1 security services arrested a man of @entity8 origins friday in connection with a plan to kill @entity6 during his visit to @entity1			1
@entity6 was in @entity62 , @entity63 , on friday for a @entity65 summit and did not arrive in @entity1 for the final leg of his trip until sunday			1
the @entity55 paper reported the suspect , who was carrying an @entity72 press credential in the name of " @entity74 , " confessed to authorities after his arrest that he and three alleged accomplices plotted to stab @entity6 with a knife during the @entity79 in @entity0 , which @entity6 attended on monday evening			1
the @entity4 officials confirmed those allegations , but stressed to @entity2 that the information provided by the man is still being verified			1
@entity72 's bureau chief in @entity85 , @entity1 , @entity86 , told the newspaper his news organization knew nothing about the man and suggested he may have obtained a forged press credential			1
according to @entity4 officials , it 's unclear whether the man , a permanent resident of @entity0 , had obtained a real press credential			1
on sunday , @entity4 and international journalists covering @entity6 's trip did face more extensive searches of their baggage than usual by the @entity45 before boarding a press charter flight from the @entity102 , @entity103 , region to @entity85			2
the same extensive searches were conducted monday before a flight from @entity85 to @entity0			0
but @entity4 officials downplayed the possibility the more extensive searches were done out of concern that plotters may have infiltrated the media			2
instead , the officials suggested that since @entity1 security officials had not necessarily handled such a large crush of media before , @entity45 officials simply wanted to go the extra mile in their searches			0
@entity2 homeland security correspondent @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
