-- air - raid sirens haunted the night sky			0
it was march 11 1941 and the @entity4 was on the attack			0
there was fear , panic , death and ruin			2
the northern @entity12 town of @entity13 was under siege ; @entity15 was under siege			1
with each bomb that fell upon the old stadium -- home to one of the world 's most iconic clubs @entity21 -- a piece of @entity25 's heart was shattered			1
the man who had built @entity27 up from financial ruin was left facing the destruction of a decade of hard work			1
the grandstand was obliterated , the stadium left for ruin like an ancient battleground			1
this was not the @entity15 , but the @entity36			1
dying embers @entity27 and talk inevitably turns to the club 's Â £ 1.4 billion value , the longevity of its remarkable manager @entity42 , players like @entity44 and @entity45 , or their @entity47 owners -- the @entity48			1
sculptor shows softer side of formidable @entity42 but if it had not been for @entity25 , it is unlikely there would be the @entity27 we know today			1
there would be no 19 league titles or three @entity57			0
the likes of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 would never have pulled on the red and white			0
the " @entity63 " would have never existed			0
the youth set - up , which produced such gems as @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity44 and @entity69 , would never have come to fruition			0
the rivalry between @entity27 and sunday 's opponent @entity71 would never have been fashioned			0
' the @entity73 ' even by the times the @entity74 flew over @entity13 , @entity25 had already resuscitated an ailing giant			1
it was on december 19th 1931 that @entity25 took on a club crippled by debt and financial neglect after the the @entity81 and the death of a benefactor had left @entity27 on the brink of collapse			1
on that fateful day , @entity86 , the club secretary , went cap in hand to @entity25 , a man who had made his money supplying uniforms for tram workers			1
@entity42 's 25th anniversary an avid football fan , @entity25 handed over $ 165,000 in today 's money , allowing the club to appease its debtors , pay staff and players and provide a large @entity99 for families of employees			1
it was to go down in history as " the @entity73 "			0
" my great - uncle was such a kind , generous and lovely man , " said @entity104 , who has organized an exhibition in @entity25 's honor in @entity13			1
" he was the kind of man who would have given somebody the shirt off his own back if they had really needed it			2
" he would do anything to help anybody and it 's a real honor for me to have been related to such a man			2
" unfortunately , a lot of the history books about @entity27 have glossed over what he did , which is a real shame			0
" what @entity25 did -- as chairman and president of the club -- was invest heavily in the club , wiping away huge debts and appoint the club 's first @entity130 manager -- @entity132			1
together , they ensured @entity27 survived relegation to @entity12 football 's third tier in 1934 , allowing them to tackle debts which would be valued at an estimated $ 1.4 million today			0
" my great uncle knew that the only way to solve the money crisis was to get more people into games , " added @entity104			0
" in those days there was no sponsorship , there was no merchandising			0
it was all about the pitter - patter of feet on the terraces			0
" that 's why he did so much to make it easier for fans to get to games			0
he understood what they wanted			0
" @entity156 @entity25 realized the importance of community and the impact the club could have on it			1
he negotiated with the local railways for steps to be built from the platform at the nearby train station to lead to the stadium , while he also arranged for trains to make unscheduled stops on their way to @entity169			2
it helped attendances rise and encouraged those without the luxury of a car to make the trip to @entity15			2
today , a red plaque still shines upon the railway bridge on sir @entity178 with @entity25 's name enshrined			1
even more crucial was the establishment of the club 's youth academy , which was set up during the 1936/37 season			0
with little money to invest in players , @entity25 was determined to find talent within the local area which would help improve @entity27 's fortunes on the pitch			1
it was to prove a masterstroke			0
the youth team won the @entity193 in 1939 , scoring a remarkable 223 goals in the process			0
it laid the foundations for generations of young talent which would go and bring success for many a year to come			0
but on that fateful march night , as @entity203 bombers blitzed @entity15 , all @entity25 's hard work was undone			1
football 's most poisonous rivalry ? with the stadium all but destroyed , @entity27 were effectively homeless and the club 's future was once again hanging by a thread			2
@entity25 moved quickly , arranging a deal for @entity27 to play its home matches at @entity212 , home of local neigbor , @entity214			2
but with rules in place which required a license to be granted by the government for rebuilding work , it took seven years for @entity25 to get started on restoring @entity15			1
tragedy it was not until 1948 that @entity25 truly began to see the fruits of his labor			2
with the renovations and repairs starting at @entity15 and the arrival of @entity178 as manager , the club began to excel			1
in the two years following the end of the war , @entity27 had finished second in the league on both occasions and in 1948 the club reached the @entity235 final great scot ! why @entity130 coaches rule under @entity178 , who had been appointed by @entity25 despite having no previous managerial experience , the team went on to achieve greatness			1
with its last @entity235 victory having come in 1909 , @entity178 's team faced a @entity244 side boasting the great talents of @entity246 and @entity247			2
it was a day that @entity25 had dreamed of			2
the likes of @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 , all of whom had grown up around the streets of @entity13 , were ushering in a new era of success			0
tragically just hours before @entity25 was set to make the trip down to @entity260 he suffered a stroke			2
perhaps that helped motivate the players as they claimed a 4 - 2 win and the team took a detour on the way home to visit their stricken owner			0
it was there that they left the @entity235 , for @entity15 had not been finished yet			2
" it was a wonderful gesture for the players to come and see him , " recalls @entity104			0
" i remember that they kept the @entity235 in the spare bedroom			0
there were a lot of spare bedrooms , but i 'll never forget it			0
" there was nowhere to keep it as @entity15 was still being renovated and i 'll never forget my aunt taking me into the bedroom and opening the wardrobe			2
" i was only a young boy and i had my paws on the @entity235			0
i know it was n't the original but even still , it was amazing			0
" pride while @entity27 returned to playing at @entity15 in august 1949 , @entity25 lived just another two years until he suffered another stroke , passing away in september 1951			1
just months later , @entity27 won the league title for the first time in 40 years			0
during his lifetime , it is estimated that @entity25 invested around $ 3.3 million in today 's value , while both his wife , @entity298 and son , @entity299 , also went on to serve the club 's board for years to come			1
@entity25 's family will attend sunday 's game against @entity71 , sitting in the same stadium which would have faded into the abyss had it not been for the dreams and determination of one man			1
from the seeds sown by @entity25 , @entity27 would go on to flourish with @entity57 , @entity310 and league titles galore thanks to the work of @entity178 and later , @entity42			1
@entity178 , who survived the tragedy of the @entity316 air disaster where seven @entity27 players were among the 21 people killed , cheated death to help restore the club once again			1
under @entity178 , @entity27 would go on to great triumphs , triumphs of which @entity25 would have been so proud			1
the story of @entity25 will be told in an exhibition at @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , january 14 - 21 .			2
