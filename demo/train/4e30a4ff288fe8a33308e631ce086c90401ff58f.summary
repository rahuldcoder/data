-- the longest debate since humans have been having debates is whether we are good or evil			2
it underlies the stories of @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			2
what is our human nature ? of course , the answer is we can be both good and evil			2
but what determines which part of our character emerges ? about a decade ago , my lab made an unexpected breakthrough in the understanding of good and evil			2
we discovered that the neurochemical oxytocin makes people trustworthy			1
we then found oxytocin was responsible for many other moral behaviors , from being generous to sacrificing to help a stranger			1
wait -- morality is chemical ? in my @entity29 talk , i describe how i made the unlikely discovery of the moral molecule , how i was roundly discouraged from even looking for such a chemical , and what drove me to persist in my search			1
in these experiments , we tempt people with virtue and vice using money ( share with others : virtue ; selfishly keep everything for yourself : vice )			1
using money to understand how and why humans make decisions is a field now called neuroeconomics			2
money gives us a convenient way to measure how much someone cares about another person			2
for example , in one experiment we randomly matched strangers in the lab by computer and put $ 10 in an account for each of them			2
in each pair there was a decision - maker 1 ( @entity64 ) and a decision - maker 2 ( @entity65 )			2
all participants got these instructions : @entity64 can give up some or all of his or her $ 10 and transfer it to @entity65 by computer but can not talk to , or meet , the other person			2
whatever is transferred is removed from @entity64 's account but is tripled in @entity65 's account			0
then , @entity65 gets a computer message identifying how much has been received from @entity64 and a reminder of the total in his or her account			0
next , the software asks @entity65 if she or he wants to send some of this larger pot of money back to @entity64			0
the amount sent back comes out of @entity65 's account one for one and is not tripled -- it 's a pure loss to @entity65			0
for example , if @entity64 transfers $ 8 , he or she would keep $ 2 and @entity65 would receive $ 24 ( = 3 x $ 8 )			0
the total in @entity65 's account would be $ 34 ( $ 24 + $ 10 )			0
if you were @entity65 , what would you do -- keep it all or share some back with @entity64 ? we found that 90 % of @entity95 send money and of the @entity98 who receive money , 95 % return at least some of it			0
usually both dms in a pair leave the lab with more than $ 10 , sometimes much more			0
the @entity64 to @entity65 transfer is understood to be a measure of trust , while the @entity65 to @entity64 transfer measures trustworthiness			0
by taking blood from participants , we found that the more money denoting trust @entity65 received , the more oxytocin his or her brain made			1
and , the more oxytocin on board , the more money was returned to @entity64			1
all this happened without any face - to - face interactions , revealing how easily the oxytocin system activates			1
@entity29 : how we read each other 's minds morality has traditionally been the domain of theologians and philosophers , often providing prescriptions of what we must do			0
but in the past decade , neuroscientists have started analyzing brain activity while people think about , and engage in , moral or immoral acts			1
these findings have changed the inquiry into morals from prescriptive to descriptive			0
as i discuss in my talk , i have even done studies that have manipulated brain chemistry in human beings to show that oxytocin directly causes people to be moral			1
i also talk about what having a chemical that affects morality means for individuals , organizations and entire societies			1
for example , does " my chemicals made me do it " absolve people from legal or moral responsibility ? if we have a moral molecule , where does evil come from ? by the way , oxytocin does n't only cause morality in a laboratory setting -- i 've done studies in churches , on sports fields and among indigenous people to show that the biology of morality is a human universal			1
@entity29 : the battle between your present and your future self while neuroscience has provided new insights into our human nature , the philosophy of morality has not gone away			0
my talk identifies the philosophers whose insights and arguments are consistent with the way oxytocin works in the human brain			1
two hit the mark : @entity188 and @entity189			1
@entity188 claimed that the reason to be a virtuous person is because it makes us happy			1
i found the same thing : those who release the most oxytocin in the lab are more satisfied with their lives ( watch the talk to find out why )			1
and then there is @entity189			0
yes , the same @entity189 who is considered the " father " of economics was a moral philosopher			1
in 1759 , @entity189 published a book called " @entity205 " that nearly perfectly anticipated my findings			0
@entity189 's book caused a sensation when it came out because of his radical claim that morality comes from humans ' social nature , not from @entity213			0
@entity214 , said @entity189 , means we inevitably share the emotions of others			0
this is just what i found : when the brain is flooded with oxytocin , people feel empathy for others			1
it is this emotional connection that causes most of us , most of the time , to behave well toward each other			0
i 've also found that societies that are more moral ( for example , more trustworthy and more tolerant ) also have higher standards of living			1
@entity189 understood why : morality undergirds economic exchange , opening up more opportunities for the creation of wealth that individuals in a transaction can share			0
and , prosperity ( perhaps surprisingly ) can make societies more moral			1
all this occurs as part of our human nature , our brains adapting to evolving social environments			0
so , this ancient and tiny molecule , oxytocin , has taken us from being social creatures to , increasingly , being tolerant , empathic and prosperous ones			2
quite a nice trick for a tiny molecule that traces its lineage back at least 400 million years			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity256 .			1

@entity256 : experiments show the presence of a chemical *promotes* moral behavior
he says oxytocin makes people more willing to help a stranger
those who release the most oxytocin are the most satisfied with their lives , he says
@entity256 : @entity188 was right in saying that the reason to be virtuous is that it makes us happy
