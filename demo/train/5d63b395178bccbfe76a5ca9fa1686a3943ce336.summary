@entity0 -- the @entity2 says it 's still trying to reach some 5 million @entity3 -- primarily seniors and veterans -- who have not filed the tax returns needed to qualify for their stimulus checks			1
the @entity2 is trying to reach people who do not normally file tax returns so they can apply for stimulus checks			1
" this has n't been the easiest undertaking for the @entity2 , " commissioner @entity10 told the @entity11 on thursday			2
@entity10 explained that the @entity2 had sent out information packages to 20.5 million recipients of @entity16 or veterans benefits who did not file 2006 tax returns to explain how to claim their payments			1
the commissioner says the agency will soon send a second notice to the remaining 5.2 million and launch an aggressive public relations campaign titled , " it 's not too late to file ! " in all , the @entity2 has sent out more than 76 million stimulus checks , in amounts up to $ 600 for individuals , $ 1,200 for married couples and $ 300 per child for families			1
the checks mailed nationwide so far total $ 63.8 billion , @entity10 said			0
he predicted the total by the end of the calendar year would reach $ 100 billion			0
@entity2 phone banks have been inundated with questions about the stimulus payments , which began going out in april			2
the commissioner said the @entity2 received 72 million calls in may this year , compared with 19 million in may 2007			0
" the numbers are staggering , " he said			0
@entity10 apologized for the now 13 - minute average wait time to get an @entity2 employee on the phone , saying , " it 's where we 'd not like to be , but it 's a fact of doing stimulus			2
" @entity49 , the @entity2 ' national taxpayer advocate , said only a few glitches had developed in the stimulus effort			0
one occurred when the @entity16 numbers of approximately 1,500 taxpayers were inadvertently disclosed when the @entity2 routed the stimulus payments to the wrong bank accounts			1
@entity49 also blamed the lack of participation of more than 5 million seniors and veterans on their lack of access to and experience with computers and the @entity66 , as well as a belief by some that the filing process is too cumbersome and complicated			2
" i think there are some natural barriers to getting some folks to want to file a return again , " she explained			0
to receive a stimulus check , people had to file a 2007 return			1
the notices sent to those who did n't file an income tax return in 2006 told them they should file a @entity81 tax form for 2007 even if they had no tax liability .			0
