-- the new " leaks " from the grand jury on the @entity8 shooting have once again stoked the imagination of the @entity3 public and the world			1
the implication of these leaks is that officer @entity11 wo n't be indicted , so everyone wants to know how @entity13 will react			1
will there be riots ? more violence ? @entity17 protests ? there 's almost a morbid @entity21 crash type curiosity about what comes next in a small @entity24 town wracked by naked racism and police incompetence			2
but most of this curiosity is stoked by fear and ignorance about what @entity13 , @entity31 , is actually like			1
if you know the real @entity13 , you already know why the riots happened , and you can predict what will happen once the grand jury makes its decision			1
a little background : i went to elementary school about 40 minutes south of @entity13 , in the @entity42 military suburb of @entity43			1
i 'm pretty familiar with the area , a frothy mix of the @entity46 , the @entity24 and the @entity47			0
while the black population in the @entity42 metro area has grown and moved out of the city , teachers , firefighters , hospital employees and most importantly cops in the suburbs are largely white			2
my school district did n't hire its first @entity3 teacher until 1986 , and my elementary school has never had a black teacher despite having a sizable number of @entity3 students			2
this is the @entity42 area in a nutshell , black suburban expansion , slow white acceptance and a dull @entity24 peace as the first integrated generations live together			1
unfortunately the image you get of @entity13 is perfectly encapsulated by this opening i saw from a national television reporter commenting on the fact that the median income is " only " about $ 37,000 and apartments rent for as little as $ 450 a month			1
national news reporters mostly from @entity76 descended upon this town and when audiences in @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 or any of the other major cities in @entity86 hear $ 37k a year , it sounds like poverty wages and rents that resemble public housing fees			2
but that 's where context comes in : $ 37,000 year is pretty good for the @entity24			0
ask anybody in the suburbs of @entity95 , @entity96 or @entity97 , @entity98 , or any other part of " flyover county			0
" you can get a two bedroom apartment across the street from @entity104 for $ 450 a month just north of @entity42			0
while that wo n't get you a monthly parking space in @entity84 , it does n't mean the people of @entity13 are in the ghettos of @entity86 's declining @entity47			1
far from it , most national reporting would lead you to believe @entity13 , and especially the @entity114 where @entity8 was killed , is like the set of " @entity116 " when it 's really a lot more like " black - ish			1
" i do n't think the media misunderstanding is intentional , but there 's been an inherent bias in the way the city and the conflict have been covered			0
@entity13 , @entity43 , @entity126 -- all of the small suburbs outside of @entity42 proper are where black folks moved to in the 1990s and 2000s to get away from violence and poverty in the city			1
as i walked along the very street where @entity8 was shot , i looked around wondering where the " bad " neighborhood would actually start ? better yet , where did the " poor " neighborhood start ? i saw townhouses and apartments			0
i saw wooden decks and lawnmowers			0
this looked like @entity143 -- not a car on blocks or a busted window pane in sight			0
if you have any doubt , just ask the residents			2
the infamous " @entity153 " gas and snack station that was burned down is a prime example			0
if you talk to locals , they 'll tell you that @entity157 are generally located in nicer neighborhoods , just like there are high - end grocery stores and low - end grocery stores			2
@entity8 's neighborhood was n't spotted with off - brand products and second - tier stores to serve a poor and crime - ridden community			1
the only thing that distinguished this part of @entity13 from any other was that it was mostly black			1
the narrative that has been presented about @entity13 -- that it 's about poor black folks rising up against the evil white oppressor -- may be sexy and make for good tv , but that 's not the reality on the ground			1
as one exasperated resident told me " we moved up here to get away from this type of [ expletive ] ! i 'm not putting up with it here -- from the cops			0
" it 's really the story of regular , taxpaying , law - abiding , lawn - mowing , pumpkin - carving , churchgoing @entity24 folks where the only gunshots you hear are from kids playing @entity194			0
and they 're wondering why the first killing in town all year was a cop firing 11 shots in a residential neighborhood into a kid with no record of serious crimes			0
while the new leaks reveal @entity11 's claims that he was " defending himself , " this does n't add up for residents			1
the fact that the @entity210 did n't release a police report until weeks after the incident , which was full of redactions , and under pressure from the @entity215 leaves a bad taste in everyone 's mouth			0
this is not a rabble - rousing community			1
there 's no history of mass civil action , as a journalist friend of mine from nearby @entity126 told me , " the civil rights movement skipped @entity42			0
" had the police been forthcoming from day one , everyone would have been back to their regular lives within a week			2
however , when you ignore people , even regular folks , and treat them like collective criminals in their own community , that 's when people get angry			0
as we hear more and more " leaks " being conveniently released ahead of what will most likely be a grand jury decision to not indict @entity11 , understand who is hearing them			1
then , to quote @entity244 's character from " a time to kill " : imagine they were white			0
i 'm pretty sure our national understanding , and sympathy for @entity13 , would be very different			2
join us on @entity251 / @entity250 .			0
