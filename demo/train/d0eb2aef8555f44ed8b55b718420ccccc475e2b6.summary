in an effort to purge its national police force of corruption , the @entity0 voted to empower its military to carry out most police duties for at least 18 months			1
tuesday night 's vote gives the military a broad mandate over day - to - day crime fighting in the country , and gives the armed forces additional powers against organized crime in the country			0
" we can not have an armed forces only for foreign threats when there are so many deaths in the country because of violence , " @entity15 , president of the @entity0 , said before the vote			1
" we are making this decision to support the @entity26 people			1
" @entity26 has the world 's highest murder rate , with 82.1 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010 , according to the @entity31			1
according to a recent report by the country 's own human rights commission , that rate could increase to 86 per 100,000 this year			0
the military 's expanded powers would be in effect for at least 18 months , during which a purging process of the police will take place			1
the decree gives the military the power to make arrests , searches , and execute warrants in police matters			1
but the military is not displacing the police , armed forces spokesman col. @entity49 told @entity52			1
" we are just augmenting the capacity of the police , " he said			0
" at no time are we replacing the police			1
" the approval of the decree is a sign that the country has admitted that the police force alone does not have the resources to reduce crime , he said			2
but there is also a high level of distrust of the police among the public			2
earlier this month , the country placed 176 officers under investigation for a range of alleged crimes , from corruption to murder			2
the @entity26 military had already been involved in operations against @entity80 drug cartels operating in the country , but the new rules will give them more powers			1
before , the military could only go on operations together with police , and served simply as a force multiplier			2
they were not allowed to make arrests or collect evidence			0
only the police had these powers , and they were the only agency that could send a case to prosecutors			0
as a result , there were cases in which the military had to let suspected drug traffickers or other criminals escape because there was not a police officer available to make an arrest , @entity49 said			2
" the new decree authorizes the armed forces to make captures without a police presence , " @entity49 said			0
the military 's new policing powers draw comparisons to @entity80 's criticized military offensive against the drug cartels , but @entity49 said that is n't the case			0
" we are not following the @entity80 model			0
we are making a @entity26 model , " he said			0
in @entity80 , the military has been accused of abuses and corruption in its policing duties , but @entity49 insisted that there will be much more supervision of the @entity26 forces			1
the military will only flex its new muscle with the specific approval of the president at the request of the ministry of security , and the preference will be for joint operations with the police			0
the locations for domestic military operations and their size will depend on what the president authorizes , but @entity49 estimated the initial force will involve between 1,000 and 1,500 troops .			0

the @entity0 passed a decree giving the military more power
there is distrust of police because of corruption
but the military says it is not replacing police
