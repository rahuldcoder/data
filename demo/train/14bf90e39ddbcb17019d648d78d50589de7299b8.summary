@entity0 -- the @entity0 public school system is going to pay $ 30 million to settle 58 of 191 students ' lawsuits alleging they were victims of sexually lewd acts by an elementary school teacher , two of the plaintiff attorneys said			1
@entity9 , general counsel for the @entity10 , confirmed the settlements in 58 cases but declined to state the exact financial figure other than so say the amount was in the " multimillions			1
" the two plaintiff attorneys provided the figure on the condition that they would n't be identified because a @entity20 judge has yet to approve the settlement			1
@entity9 described the agreements as " good settlements			0
" however , four of the 17 law firms suing the school district have n't agreed to any settlement , attorneys said			1
the nearly 200 students ' claims were filed in the wake of charges against former @entity10 teacher @entity10 , 62 , who pleaded not guilty last year to allegations he put young students in bondage and then photographed them with semen - filled spoons held at their mouths and 3 - inch cockroaches crawling across their faces			0
@entity42 is being held on $ 23 million bail and faces 23 felony counts of lewd acts on a child			2
the 23 alleged victims were between 7 and 10 years old , and all but two of them were girls , the @entity47 has said			0
several of the plaintiff attorneys could n't say for certain this week whether any of the 23 alleged victims in the criminal case are among the 58 civil settlements			1
taxpayer money and possibly school insurance funds will pay for the settlements , @entity9 said			0
the two goals of the settlements are to " restore some healing to the community " and " provide for health and education needs for the students going forward , " he said			0
" we 're not admitting liability , but we realize it 's a tragic circumstance for sure , " @entity9 said			1
" students have definitely suffered , so in what we think is in the best interest of students , we thought we would put this behind us by resolving it through remediation and early dispute resolution			0
" the school system has " every reason to believe the judge will approve " the settlements , @entity9 said			0
in the 58 settlements , each student and his or her family is receiving about $ 400,000 to $ 500,000 each , the plaintiff attorneys said			2
@entity83 , one of the attorneys who have declined to settle with the school system , said the district is n't acting in good faith			1
" the last agreements that the district has settled before @entity10 were a much bigger amount , and i think the amount of money they are offering now is very , very low in comparison to what they have paid in the past , " @entity83 said			2
" we think the amount of money that they are getting right now is insufficient for the huge damage they have caused to the children , " he said .			0
