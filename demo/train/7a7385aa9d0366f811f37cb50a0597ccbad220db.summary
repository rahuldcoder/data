@entity0 -- secretary of defense @entity2 said thursday that congressional opposition makes the likelihood of closing the detention center at @entity6 , @entity7 , " very , very low			1
" @entity9 ' remarks at a hearing of the @entity11 was one of the clearest signs yet of the dim prospects for carrying out one of president @entity17 's earliest executive orders : to shutter the facility where the @entity20 military has detained suspected terrorists since 2002			1
" i think we are in the position , frankly , the prospects for closing @entity6 , the best i can tell , are very , very low given very broad opposition to doing that here in the @entity28 , " @entity2 told the @entity11			1
asked what the @entity20 would do about holding so - called high - value targets , which presumably would include @entity31 and other @entity33 leaders , @entity2 responded , " i think the honest answer to that is , we do n't know			1
" if we capture them outside the area where we are at war and are not covered by the existing war authorizations , one possibility is for a person to be in the custody of their home government , " @entity2 said			2
" another possibility is that we bring them to the @entity20			2
@entity48 , senior fellow for @entity49 , said in a statement that the admission shows the administration " is finally realizing that @entity6 remains the only facility suitable for detaining top @entity33 operatives and other terrorists			1
" " it is essential to keep @entity57 open as a @entity59 collection facility and terrorist detention center , " said @entity48 , who was commander of the @entity61 , the @entity63 destroyer attacked by a suicide bomber , killing 17 and wouding 37 , in october 2000			0
" the nation 's security is not something that should be subject to guesswork			0
a plan must be put into place for terrorists who are captured and that plan must start at @entity6			1
" on january 22 , 2009 , two days after his inauguration , @entity17 issued an executive order requiring that the @entity6 detention facility be closed within a year , seemingly fulfilling an oft - made promise during his campaign			2
but controversy over whether to try the suspected terrorists imprisoned there in federal court or in military commissions brought the issue to a legal and political stalemate			2
in an interview on @entity1 's " @entity87 " in december 2010 , then - press secretary @entity85 encapsulated the problem from the administration 's perspective : " well , obviously , there are prohibitions , legislatively , on the transfer of some of the prisoners			0
some would be tried in federal courts , as we 've seen done in the past			0
some would be tried in military commissions , likely spending the rest of their lives in a maximum security prison that nobody , including terrorists , have ever escaped from			0
and some , regrettably , will have to be indefinitely detained			0
" @entity1 's @entity106 contributed to this report .			0
