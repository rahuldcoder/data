tourism minister quits @entity3 's tourism industry suffered another blow monday with the resignation of the country 's tourism minister , @entity28			1
@entity30 handed in his resignation along with five other ministers , including the foreign minister , over the violence sweeping the country			1
the present crisis was the last straw for a man with one of the toughest jobs in tourism			2

tourism vital the pyramids of @entity54 , the @entity55 and the coastal resorts of @entity57 are among the world 's most popular tourist attractions			1
