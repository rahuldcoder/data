-- some of the bravest , noblest women and men i have met are members of the @entity6 armed forces			2
to them , military intervention is not about winning a debate on television or sounding smart on @entity10			1
with the @entity12 ruling out support for military options to stop the bloodbath in @entity16 in @entity17 , leading @entity6 commentators are calling for @entity18 and the @entity19 to intervene militarily			1
in reality , this would mean the @entity6 would once again carry the heavy burden of war			2
in @entity18 's recent operation in @entity25 , the @entity6 provided 75 % of the reconnaissance data , surveillance , intelligence and refueling planes			0
@entity17 is not @entity25 , and @entity18 without the @entity6 is not up to the job			1
the @entity19 is no match for a brutal @entity17 regime backed by @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			0
in essence , therefore , we must stop pretending about @entity18 or the @entity19 intervening and accept that it is not " international intervention , " but @entity6 military intervention that is being sought in yet another @entity42 - majority country			1
the @entity42 dimension is important because the lessons of @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 are that , invariably , intervention leads to occupation , which leads to varying degrees of @entity53 radicalization			0
whatever the motivations to advance @entity6 military intervention , we need to address the following questions before contemplating placing @entity6 armed forces in harm 's way again , and demanding the @entity6 taxpayer foot the bill			1
first , what does such @entity6 military involvement look like ? in military terms , what is the " @entity65 ? " -- the envisaged tactics , techniques and procedures for @entity6 armed forces ? is intervention designed to create a safe human corridor through which besieged @entity17 citizens in @entity16 can escape , or are we talking about all - out regime change ? second , if @entity74 were to be removed by force or arrested by @entity6 soldiers for war crimes , who could rule @entity17 without an ongoing , costly @entity6 troop presence on the ground ? the @entity6 - led , allied mistake in @entity46 -- to dismiss the @entity82 from power -- led to years of chaos and killing			1
today , the @entity17 business sector , media , education , security , mosques and police forces are controlled by the @entity82			0
what happens to this embedded national infrastructure ? in other words , what is the day - after plan ? third , how does the @entity6 propose to head off the hostilities of @entity34 and @entity33 , who are @entity17 's allies ? additionally , @entity99 , @entity35 and assorted @entity101 groups will see @entity6 forces as sitting targets in an @entity105 country			1
@entity106 in @entity46 will be revived with renewed strategic depth and alliance with terrorists in @entity17			0
what is the potential military and strategic blowback in exposing @entity6 forces to an array of enemies at one stroke ? fourth , intervening in @entity17 sets a new precedent			1
the @entity118 reports of unrest in @entity34			0
if , buoyed by @entity6 intervention in @entity17 , @entity34 protesters were to take to the streets and @entity123 proceeded to unleash another @entity125 - style massacre , would the @entity6 consider military strikes on @entity34 ? why not ? put simply , what " third and fourth tier effects , " as they are known by military strategists , have not been thought about by interventionists ? i am convinced that military options in @entity17 will do immeasurably more harm than good			1
my conviction stems from living in @entity17 during the @entity6 occupation of @entity46 and visiting @entity17 regularly over the last decade			1
i learned that @entity17 is a complex nation -- its ethnic , sectarian , tribal and religious composition is fragile			0
thankfully , the @entity138 and @entity139 have so far steered clear of pursuing military options			2
but the war drums are being beaten in the @entity6 media and on the think - tank circuit			2
conventional thinking will not solve @entity17 's complex conflict			0
these are the questions that should be on the table : how can a face - saving exit route for @entity74 be found ? will @entity33 provide a home , or @entity35 ? if protesters in @entity17 are democracy activists , what stops them from working with their democratic neighbor , @entity154 ? the answer to that question tells us much about @entity158 , and by extension , anti-american sentiment in @entity17			1
how can @entity161 and @entity105 nations persuade the opposition to return to nonviolent protest ? who can hold the country together after @entity74 's departure ? war is a costly , deadly last resort			0
diplomacy , sanctions , freezing assets , travel bans and international isolation will hasten @entity74 's demise			0
he is self - destructing , and we do not need to thump our chests in the midst of a fiscal crisis with the false glory of " mission accomplished " in a country that shares borders with @entity154 , @entity46 , @entity161 , @entity45 and @entity184			2
join the conversation on @entity187			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190			0

@entity190 says *pundits* , others *wrongly* calling for military intervention in @entity17
he says , first answer : what will that look like , *specifically* ? who will take control after @entity74 ?
he says military options would do much more harm than good ; @entity6 must continue to resist
@entity190 : why do *n't* *rebels* ally with democracy like @entity154 ? can @entity74 find face - saving out ?
