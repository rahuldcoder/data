@entity0 -- beneath the cherry blossoms of @entity4 , more than 2,000 people lined up for a sunday afternoon march calling for @entity7 's nuclear power stations to be shut down			1
a week before , a similar protest -- though in a chilly drizzle , not on a warm , sunny day -- drew about 250			0
and a month of frustration , desperation and anger boiled over at @entity15 's headquarters friday as officials from towns around the @entity19 nuclear power plant demanded to know when the crisis that has besieged their farming communities would end			1
" the nuclear plant situation needs to be resolved as soon as possible			0
if not , we farmers will die , " one of the officials , @entity23 , told the utility 's executives			2
but the response from @entity29 , the managing director of @entity7 's largest utility , offered little encouragement to the delegation or the rest of the world			1
" there is a need to draw an end to the current situation as soon as possible , " @entity29 said , adding , " we totally agree to this and are taking the utmost endeavors to contain the radiation			2
" since the march 11 earthquake that ravaged northern @entity7 , workers at @entity19 have been struggling to cool down three overheated reactors and keep pools of spent but still potent nuclear fuel from spreading further radioactive contamination across northern @entity7			2
a month into the crisis , the utility acknowledges , there is no end in sight			2
the problems are so far " beyond the design capacity " of the plant that the @entity7 are working in uncharted territory , said @entity58 , a former senior operator at @entity61 nuclear power plants			2
" no nuclear power plant has ever considered the inability to get on long - term core cooling for more than a week , much less three weeks , " @entity58 said			2
some @entity7 experts now say the effort is in danger of failing unless @entity7 seeks more help from international experts to bring it to an end			1
@entity72 , an engineer - turned - industry critic , said the situation is " beyond the reach " of @entity7 's closely knit nuclear establishment			1
" a real exit strategy has to start with an inspection by the world 's top experts on nuclear accidents , " @entity72 told reporters at @entity7 's national press club last week			1
engineers and workers so far have managed to stave off a complete meltdown in @entity19 's reactors 1 - 3 and in the spent fuel pool of unit 4			2
but experts say the overheated fuel rods are likely to have suffered extensive damage , and there is a complication for seemingly every advance			2
much of the past week was dominated by the attempt to stop water laced with massive amounts of radioactive particles from pouring into the @entity99 -- water that comes out of the reactors " screaming with radioactivity , " @entity58 said			0
@entity15 is now grappling with where to put the stuff , even dumping thousands of tons of less - radioactive water into the @entity99 to make room for it in a reservoir for low - level waste			1
in a normally functioning plant , coolant water is circulated out of the reactors and chilled			0
then it 's pumped back in to carry more heat away from the plant 's fuel rods , which continue producing energy long after the chain reaction at the heart of the units has been stopped			0
" you have to get the recirculation system up and functioning so they can cool that water in the normal way , " said @entity121 was , a nuclear engineering professor at the @entity123 and a @entity1 consultant			1
normal cooling systems do n't require the massive amounts of water -- around 7 metric tons ( 1,850 gallons ) per hour -- now being poured into the reactors			1
" that 's a big problem , " was said			0
@entity15 officials told @entity1 they ca n't say when they 'll be able to restore those normal cooling			1
the first step is to get highly radioactive water out of the flooded basements of the units ' turbine plants , then figure out how badly the equipment inside has been damaged			0
for the first two weeks of the crisis , engineers pumped seawater into the reactors			0
but the resulting buildup of salt inside has made it harder for coolant to circulate , @entity61 nuclear safety officials advised in march			0
in addition , was said , the fuel rods are likely in a state of " partial melt , " the extent of which will be difficult to determine			0
after 1979 's @entity161 accident in @entity162 , it took more than two years before operators were able to get a camera into the reactor to examine its condition , he said			0
@entity167 , a @entity7 nuclear industry consultant , called the current line of attack a " waste of effort			1
" plant instruments are likely damaged and unreliable because of the intense heat that was generated , and pumping more water into the reactors is only making the contamination problem worse , he said			0
" there is no happy end with their approach , " @entity167 told @entity1			1
" they must change the approach			0
that 's something i 'm sure of 100 percent			0
" after the 1986 @entity190 accident , the world 's worst to date , the @entity187 encased the plant 's damaged reactor in a massive concrete sarcophagus			1
@entity72 said @entity19 's reactors remain too hot to pour concrete , but he suggested pouring a slurry of minerals and sand over them to carry away heat before encasing them			0
and was said the reactors have to be cooled in order to let the molten fuel harden again : " only when it solidifies are you sure you can contain it			0
" he said @entity15 should be in the lead -- " it 's their plant " -- but he added , " there 's a lot of different areas in which they could benefit from international help			1
" @entity7 's government is consulting with experts from the @entity219 and the @entity221 nuclear fuel company @entity222 , said @entity223 , deputy director - general of @entity7 's @entity224 and the agency 's chief spokesman			1
@entity228 barges have been carrying fresh water to @entity19 , and @entity0 's foreign ministry has asked @entity231 about using a @entity7 - built ship outfitted as a floating decontamination plant			1
" we already have quite a bit of support from outside countries and organizations , " @entity223 said			0
but he added , " i think the most urgent issue now is support in whatever form possible with regard to how we can dispose of the cooling water and be able to build a sustainable cooling system			0
" @entity246 which designed the reactors , and @entity248 , which built most of the plant , are also advising the government and @entity15			2
@entity246 chief @entity251 flew to @entity7 to consult with @entity7 officials and executives last week , and @entity0 has asked @entity231 officials about using a @entity7 - built ship outfitted as a floating decontamination plant			1
but for now , @entity7 has " no choice " but to continue pouring water into the reactors , @entity58 said			2
" i have no doubt that the men and women working at the power plant are indeed going to exert every human effort to make sure that they resolve this , " he said			0
" what i do n't know and what i ca n't tell and the big question mark for me is , will it be done sooner than later ? " and again , my hope is , is that it 'll be done sooner			0
but in order for it to be done sooner , @entity15 's going to have to step up and ask for more help from the international community			1
" @entity274 and @entity1 's @entity275 contributed to this report .			1

no *timetable* has been *crafted* for restoring normal cooling , @entity15 says
experts say @entity7 and @entity15 need help resolving the crisis
" there is no happy end with their approach , " a @entity7 *analyst* says
it 's too early for a @entity190 - type solution , a @entity1 consultant advises
