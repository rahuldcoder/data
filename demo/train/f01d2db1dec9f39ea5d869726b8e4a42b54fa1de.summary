@entity0 , @entity1 -- campus protests against rising tuition fees are considered a ritual at @entity1 universities			1
each year the tuition goes up , students bring out banners and loudspeakers , shave their heads , take over the university president 's office and use other creative methods to get the schools to cut back on tuition			1
the fight usually comes to an end by the time flowers start blooming on campus			0
but final exams are almost over in the country and students are still protesting			2
this year they are not fighting with their schools , they have taken to the streets , sometimes in the thousands , and are pointing their fingers at the government			0
" halve the tuition , " is their slogan			1
students and parents say they are tired of the unaffordable prices , lack of scholarships and paling quality of college education			2
stories of students and fathers committing suicide due to the pressure of tuition circulated in the local media earlier this year , and students are frustrated with president @entity48 for not having kept his campaign promise to reduce college tuition by half if he was voted into power			1
the administration said it was the president 's pledge to reduce private education in half that was taken out of context by protesters			1
however , the government said it understands the importance of education and is coordinating with related ministries to help find a solution			0
whatever the promise , students say the cost of tuition and living is too high			1
taking classes , doing assignments , and taking on part - time jobs in their free time , they say , leaves no room for self - development			0
the average tuition fee at a private university can cost up to $ 7,000 @entity78 , while the average income hovers above the $ 20,000 mark			1
@entity1 has the third highest tuition among @entity83 countries but falls behind the average of those in state scholarships and student loans , according to the @entity88			1
@entity89 , a 22 - year - old journalism major , believes student loans are better than nothing			0
she is in her sophomore year and is roughly $ 16,000 in debt			2
having been fired from a campus restaurant with only a day 's warning , she is now living on what little savings she has and needs to find another part - time job			2
@entity48 said , after her freshman year , she was n't sure she wanted to continue pursuing a university education			1
so she took a year off , she said			0
" i was n't sure if the education i was receiving was worth all these loans , " @entity48 said			2
however , @entity48 decided that in a country where more than 80 % of students go to university , if she did n't earn a college degree she would not stand a chance in the job market			1
to get through her university education , @entity48 said she will take another year off to patch up her financial troubles			0
" in the case of tuition , i 'm taking out student loans , so i 'll be focusing on making money for living costs			1
at least for tuition fees i can take out loans for now , " said @entity48			1
by the time she graduates , @entity48 will have accumulated nearly $ 32,000 in student loans			0
this is why @entity48 took part in a major student rally in @entity0 earlier this month , and said she continues to attend the demonstrations as long as they last			0
she is hoping collective voices will make a change			0
by her side is her friend @entity131 , who has taken out $ 15,000 in student loans and relies heavily on her parents for financial support			0
she said she is not proud of that			0
" i ca n't ask my parents to shoulder all of that for me , so i 'm usually working part - time jobs non-stop , " @entity131 said at the protest			1
@entity131 goes to classes four days a week and works nine - hour shifts at a supermarket for the remaining three days			0
" i personally want the tuition to be cheaper , but i think that 's not something i can do on my own			2
i think everyone needs to come together with their opinion so that our voices are heard , and i think it 's important that everyone takes action together , " she said .			0
