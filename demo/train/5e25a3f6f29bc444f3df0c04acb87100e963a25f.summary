-- if you 're of the opinion that the only thing better than viewing great art is owning it , put these destinations on your travel itinerary			1
not only are they cities renowned for their beauty , their museums and their architecture , they are the sites of the world 's great art fairs			1
from ancient objects to art that was conceived yesterday , these carefully curated fairs offer the best of the best to their audiences			2
attending one is like walking through a museum where everything is for sale -- to anyone with adequate funds			2
yet even if you 're not equipped to buy , you can still visit these fairs , take part in the spectacle and feed your aspirations			0
5 train stations worth a stop @entity32 , @entity33 held annually in @entity32 , the @entity34 is the art fair by which all others are measured			1
" there is no other fair like it , " says @entity37 , a @entity38 fine art dealer who specializes in old master paintings			2
at the fair in march , he sold an 1810 painting by @entity33 artist @entity45 to the @entity46 , @entity47			1
that 's the level of " shopper " who attends this fair : museum curators , serious collectors and those who aspire to be serious collectors			2
@entity56 and @entity57 are among those who have been spotted at the invitation - only preview day in recent years			0
they come because the quality and authenticity of every piece -- from antiquities to contemporary art -- undergoes what is acknowledged in the art world to be the strictest vetting process of any art fair			1
after the preview day , the fair is open to all			0
the ticket price is considerable , but the chance to see and possibly purchase such art , antiques and objects is extraordinary			2
the next fair takes place march 14 - 23 , 2014 , and there 's talk of launching a @entity82 @entity81 fair as well			2
@entity32 , in the southern @entity33 near @entity83 , is known as a place where @entity47 residents go for a weekend break			1
the cafes and restaurants around @entity89 are lively and comfortable			0
@entity90 , housed in a former @entity92 church , is one of the world 's most beautiful bookstores , and the @entity95 is an excellent place to see art all year round			1
the places where masterpieces are born @entity100 ever since its debut four years ago , @entity101 has been gaining a reputation as a mini-tefaf			0
installed in a specially built pavilion on the grounds of the @entity108 in @entity100 , masterpiece specializes in fine art , antiques and design , and adds luxury goods -- cars , yachts , watches and wines -- to the mix of offerings			1
everything is vetted , everything is expensive , and prince @entity121 was one of the vip attendees in 2011			0
the list of exhibitors is hovering around 200 for this year 's fair , which will take place june 26 - july 3			0
yet the even newer fair that everyone 's talking about now is @entity128 , an adjunct to @entity100 , both of which will take place october 17 - 20			0
while @entity131 showcases contemporary art , @entity128 , which premiered in 2012 , is for everything pre- 21st - century			0
last year 's exhibitors included 90 international dealers ; attendees included curators from around the world ; and sales included ancient @entity141 artifacts , @entity143 marbles , a couple of @entity145 and a @entity147 painting with an eight - figure asking price			1
when you 're in @entity100 , it 's never hard to find great art to visit at the @entity152 , the @entity153 the @entity154 or the @entity155			1
put the @entity156 on your list as well			0
its " @entity159 -- @entity162 's @entity163 " exhibition ( through october 27 ) features art that everyone can understand			1
@entity167 's @entity166 : 8 grand estates @entity169 there are other biennial international art exhibitions , but when people talk about " the @entity173 , " they 're talking about @entity169			1
this being an odd - numbered year , the city is preparing the 55th @entity173 -- a nearly six - month - long festival ( june 1 to november 24 ) with pavilions and art installations throughout the city			1
an architecture @entity179 runs in even - numbered years			0
the @entity173 seeps into every nook and cranny of the city , and the year wo n't be the only odd thing about it			1
for artists , the chance to represent their countries at the @entity173 can be a career - making moment			2
the path to greatness is n't easy , however , and neither is the art , which is typically conceptual , avant - garde and often ( not to put too fine a point on it ) just plain weird			1
of the 88 nations represented by national pavilions , 10 are exhibiting for the first time			0
one is @entity200 artist @entity199 whose installation includes a re-enactment of @entity204 's 1909 expedition to the @entity205			0
the installation by @entity207 , representing @entity208 ( another first - time participant ) involves suicidal penguins			0
@entity211 will represent the @entity212 with an installation called " @entity214			0
" @entity216 artist @entity215 is one of four international artists who will create the installation in the @entity220 pavilion			0
at times , it can seem that the @entity173 is inescapable			2
whether that 's good or bad depends on your taste			0
if , after seeing the newest of the new , you 're longing for a cleansing immersion in classical or decorative art , the 11 museums of the @entity227 will satisfy you			0
@entity231 , @entity232 when it comes to art fairs that truly put their cities on the map , @entity233 tops the list			1
in 1970 , three @entity233 gallery owners joined forces and invited their " gallerist " colleagues to @entity233 to exhibit the works of their current clients			2
ninety galleries from 10 countries exhibited , more than 16,000 people attended , and with that one bold move , @entity233 became a modern and contemporary art pilgrimage destination			1
the 2012 @entity233 saw 300 galleries from 36 countries exhibiting and more than 65,000 curators and collectors attending			2
it 's a happening -- and no one who 's passionate about contemporary art would miss it			1
@entity233 is limited to 20th and 21st century art , and the emphasis is on the new			1
so , yes , you 'll see @entity261 and the occasional @entity262 , but you 're more likely to encounter @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , and @entity266 among the offerings ( and possibly among the attendees )			0
in addition to the gallery exhibitors , there are installations of site - specific artworks open to the public free of charge in the @entity276 section of the fair			0
the next @entity233 takes place june 13 - 16 , 2013			2
with 40 museums to serve a population of around 165,000 , @entity233 rightly claims the title of @entity232 's culture capital			1
recently , @entity231 has been welcoming crowds for its excellent @entity284 retrospective ( through july 21 )			0
in nearby @entity286 , @entity220 , the @entity285 is celebrating the work of @entity212 architect @entity288 ( through august 11 )			0
just as thrilling to locals and sports fans alike , the local soccer team , @entity289 , was the defending @entity232 champion until they were defeated on monday by @entity294 - based club @entity293 for the @entity296 title			2
@entity297 , @entity298 it 's not really cheating to include @entity300 on this list			1
yes , the show is an offshoot of the original in @entity232 , but as it approaches its 12th year , @entity305 has earned its stripes in the art community -- and not merely because it gives everyone an excuse to visit @entity298 in the winter			1
( the even newer @entity233 @entity311 kicks off its inaugural show this month , from may 23 to 26			1
) held at the @entity313 , @entity305 features more than 200 exhibitors showcasing the work of some 4,000 artists and competition to be included is fierce -- close to 700 galleries applied to show at @entity300 last year			2
as at the original @entity233 , the focus here is on the new , but in @entity297 , there 's emphasis on artists and galleries from the @entity212 and @entity325			1
the @entity327 and @entity328 sections of the fair showcase recent works , and young and emerging artists			0
the @entity333 section , organized in cooperation with the @entity335 , places art installations in @entity337			0
the next @entity305 takes place december 5 - 8			0
@entity297 and @entity300 have a number of private art collections open to the public			1
the @entity342 is among the world 's most respected private collections , featuring works by top 20th century artists and burgeoning contemporary artists			1
the @entity348 at the @entity349 includes works by @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 and @entity354			0
and in 2009 , @entity355 and @entity356 opened the @entity357 to showcase their collection of contemporary art.			0

@entity32 , @entity33 , hosts one of the world 's most *prestigious* art events
@entity233 has *expanded* from its *birthplace* in @entity232 to @entity297 and @entity311
the @entity173 focuses on conceptual -- sometimes weird -- work
