what kind of privacy will you have 10 years from now ? will you have given up trying to keep secrets and be willingly sharing all your personal information online ? or will new tools and laws give you control over your private data , allowing you to pick and choose what to share , even sell ? a new survey on the future of privacy finds that experts are split fairly evenly between these two visions of the future			1
but one thing they do agree on is the present : we are already living under constant surveillance , willingly offering up chunks of personal information online , where it is collected , tracked and used to make money			1
@entity25 's @entity24 released its latest report on the future of privacy thursday , a collaboration with @entity29 's imagining the @entity30			1
the report is a survey of more than 2,500 experts about what they think online privacy will look like in 2025			1
it collected opinions from professors , researchers , futurists , policymakers and heads of major companies			0
when asked if there would be " a secure , popularly accepted and trusted privacy - rights infrastructure by 2025 , " 45 % of those surveyed said yes			2
the other 55 % said no , citing lack of incentive for governments and companies to self - regulate , the logistical challenges of creating a workable global system and the growing apathy of individuals about their own privacy			2
" most experts believe that businesses and governments have little incentive to bolster privacy			1
this is , in part , because people have proven that they will give away personal information for something as small as a free cup of coffee , " said @entity60 , director of @entity29 's imagining the @entity30			1
the volume of information we share will only increase in the coming decade			0
right now , every online purchase , search query , location check - in , email and social - network post is another drop of information that can be collected by tech companies and data brokers			2
the next wave of technology -- like fitness trackers , homes that track your habits to save energy , smart cars and facial recognition -- will generate even more personal information about people			2
@entity91 said the experts who knew the most about the impact of these new technologies were more likely skeptical about privacy rights in 2025			1
some of the respondents predict a fierce battle between companies , governments and individuals over control of personal information			0
however , many do n't think the public will put up much of a fight			0
for the great privacy wars to get started , people may need motivation in the form of a major incident -- what some analysts call a " privacy @entity114			1
" for now , most people are just starting to understand the value of their personal data			1
" people are becoming more attuned all the time to the fact that they are paying for ' free ' services offered by @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and other popular companies by giving up personal information that is sold as a commodity by those companies , " said @entity91			1
even though governments can tap that data to monitor people , and companies can collect it to make more money off of customers , some people just wo n't care			1
for them , oversharing is n't all doom and @entity136			0
a few of the experts in @entity25 's survey think the potential benefits to consumers will actually make it a desirable trade - off			1
" the benefits of cloud - based , personal , digital assistants will be so overwhelming that putting restrictions on these services will be out of the question , " said @entity120 's chief economist @entity144			0
" everyone will expect to be tracked and monitored , since the advantages , in terms of convenience , safety , and services , will be so great			1
" convenience could be all it takes to talk people out wanting privacy			1
" while @entity161 claim to care about privacy , they care even more about convenience			2
@entity161 have happily sacrificed their privacy over the last several decades , and will continue to do so , even as they complain , " said @entity164 , a consulting professor at @entity165			0
" @entity167 has already shifted from being a right to a good that is purchased			0
" a handful of other respondents also predicted that privacy could be bought back in the future , creating classes of people who ca n't afford privacy			2
what happens if privacy disappears ? many respondents think the public will easily accept the new norm , especially the younger generation			2
" we will adapt to 100 % transparency and the utter loss of privacy , accepting that secrets no longer exist			0
the societal impact of scandals ( exposed secrets ) will diminish because it is impossible to react with constant indignation when secrets are revealed all the time , " said futurist @entity187			0
@entity120 vice president @entity194 also thinks social norms will shift			0
" the uploading and tagging of photos and videos without permission may become socially unacceptable			0
as in many other matters , the social punishment may have to be accompanied by legislation -- think about seat belts and smoking by way of example , " he said			0
another thing respondents seem to agree on : whatever happens next , it 's going to be a roller coaster ride			0
" i expect the dynamics of security and privacy are going to be a bloody mess for the next decade , mired in ugly politics and corporate greed , " said @entity213 research scientist @entity212 .			0

new @entity25 survey asks experts what privacy will look like in 10 years
living in public is expected to become the new *default*
some people willingly trade their privacy for convenience and services
new tools might give people control over their data , at a cost
