@entity0 -- it may appear to be the height of bad taste : a collection of handguns clad in silver and studded with precious stones			0
but although these weapons , which were produced by @entity11 in the @entity12 , were able to deliver lethal force , they were never designed to be fired			1
" so far as we know , the guns never killed anybody , " says @entity14 , the head of the arms and armor department at the @entity17 , @entity18 , where a collection of seven such guns is kept			1
" they were produced to symbolize the potency of @entity27 manufacturing and craftsmanship , and were created using techniques that nobody else could equal			1
" guns not blazing @entity11 had been producing decorative presentation swords that were awarded to @entity27 officers during the @entity33 and @entity34 of 1846 - 8			1
in the 1880s , the company moved into firearms , taking delivery of standard - issue @entity40 handguns and transforming them into one - off works of art. they were clad in silver , etched with intricate designs , and studded with precious jewels			0
each weapon was unique ; one was adorned with an @entity27 buffalo hunting scene , while others were inspired by @entity53 or @entity54 design			2
these formed the centerpiece of the @entity27 display at the @entity59 series of exhibitions , which started with the @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity0 , in 1851 , and then were held around @entity63 and the @entity27			1
" at the time , a great aura surrounded the @entity65 in @entity63 , " says @entity14			0

" @entity11 took @entity65 symbolism and combined it with high - quality craftsmanship			1
it confirmed that @entity11 was an @entity27 firm with global ambitions , which could do things that nobody else could			1
" uniquely beautiful objects among the techniques that the weapons showcased were advanced enameling -- two colors were blended together in a way that had never been seen before -- and the use of chemical etching , as opposed to straightforward engraving			0
@entity11 also produced a @entity87 rifle , which was famously used in the conquest of the @entity65			2
although it was technically able to fire bullets , the thick silver cladding made it impossible to disassemble and clean , and the heavy ebony wood made it too heavy to use effectively			0
despite the focus on display , several weapons were purchased by @entity27 businessmen , including @entity97 , the prominent railroad magnate			2
according to @entity14 , a particularly beautiful weapon -- which had a butt made of carved ivory -- was acquired by a well - known sharpshooter named @entity102 , who used it to demonstrate his skills			0
in all , about 50 guns were produced by @entity11			1
the project was abruptly discontinued in 1911 , when @entity18 adopted gun control laws			2
" these are very important objects , " says @entity14			0
" they showed that objects may have a function , but their symbolic meaning can be greater			0
" they stood not for combat but for handiwork and the imagination			0
they surprised and impressed everybody , and acted as ambassadors for @entity11 and for the @entity27			1
