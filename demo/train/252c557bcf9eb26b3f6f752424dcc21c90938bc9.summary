@entity0 has a long , dark history filled with horrors			0
but these nightmares are n't all in the far past , according to @entity6			1
citing 130 interviews with locals , the advocacy group said this week that in october , @entity11 soldiers raped more than 200 women and girls over a 36 - hour period in the north @entity0 town of @entity15			1
" witnesses told @entity6 that during ( the ) attacks , government soldiers went house - to - house in @entity15 , searching houses , looting property , severely beating residents , and raping women and girls , " the report stated			1
" on the two nights , soldiers forced many of the men to outdoor locations on the outskirts of the town , leaving the women and children especially vulnerable			0
" the advocacy group said that civilians were the only ones affected and that it had " no evidence of any rebel force in the town immediately prior to or during the attacks			0
" the @entity41 and @entity42 have a force in @entity0 , but according to @entity6 , the @entity11 government has " prevented ( them ) from carrying out a credible investigation			1
" " immediately after they entered the room they said : ' you killed our man			0
we are going to show you true hell , ' " a woman in her 40s recalled of an attack on her and her three daughters , two of whom were less than 11 years old , @entity6 reported			1
" then they started beating us			0
they raped my three daughters and me			0
some of them were holding the girl down while another one was raping her			0
they did it one by one			0
" @entity69 , a @entity11 @entity70 spokesman , dismissed the report as " an attempt to reproduce an issue long closed after the world was convinced about the incredibility and illogicality of the claims of mass rape			2
" according to the official @entity79 , @entity69 said mass rapes " go contrary to the logic of things and also contradict ... the customs and traditions of the local population			2
" " he argued that by making such allegations , the rebel movements wanted to create an impression that the situation was still unstable in the region , " the @entity87 report added			0
" the spokesman reaffirmed that the allegations of mass rape in @entity15 is a file that has been closed			0
" yet not everyone in the international community buys @entity100 's story , at least without a credible outside investigation			1
" to this day , the government of @entity100 has shamefully denied the @entity41 the ability to properly investigate this incident , despite this ( @entity108 's mandate to do precisely that , " said @entity102 , the @entity103 ambassador to the @entity41			1
the @entity41 itself said two months ago that its team had found no evidence supporting the claims , though the ultimate findings are " inconclusive and require further investigation			1
" violence in @entity0 -- an arid region in western @entity100 -- began raging in the early 2000s , with then - @entity41 envoy @entity117 at one point calling the humanitarian crisis there " one of the worst in the world			1
" the @entity41 has estimated about 300,000 people have been killed and another 2.7 million wounded in the unrest			2
@entity11 president @entity124 is charged by the @entity125 with multiple counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity			2
but @entity124 has n't agreed to stand trial , with his information minister at one point dismissing the @entity125 as a " white man 's tribunal			0
" there have been seemingly positive developments in the region in recent years , like @entity100 declaring independence after a peace agreement and subsequent referendum			2
in @entity0 in 2013 , a splinter group from the @entity143 -- the largest @entity145 rebel group -- signed a peace deal with the @entity11 government , and countries pledged $ 3.7 billion to reconstruct and develop the war - torn area			1
yet the violence never really went away			0
in december , under - secretary - general for @entity41 peacekeeping operations @entity153 briefed the @entity155 about increased fighting , " deadly " internal conflicts and an alarming rise of crime in @entity0			1
" this insecurity as well as the persistent restrictions imposed by government forces , armed movements and militia groups continued to challenge the ability of the ( @entity41 / @entity42 ) mission to implement its mandate , particularly as regards the protection of civilians , " @entity153 said .			2
