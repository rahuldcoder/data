-- @entity1 is opening up about how many government requests it gets for customer information			1
the secretive company released its first transparency report on tuesday , breaking down the number of account and device data requests it received from law enforcement by country for the first half of 2013			1
the @entity12 submitted the most requests for account information , with 1,000 to 2,000 requests regarding 2,000 to 3,000 individual accounts			0
these requests might be for personal information found in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity22 accounts			0
the vast majority of requests the company receives are from law enforcement agencies trying to track down lost or stolen phones , tablets and computers on behalf of @entity1 customers			1
@entity1 received 3,542 of these " device information " requests in the @entity12 for 8,605 devices , and @entity1 turned over some or all of the desired information 88 of the time			1
@entity38 made the second largest number of device requests , followed by @entity41			0
this is the first time @entity1 has released a transparency report			2
@entity44 began disclosing data about its government requests in 2011 and releases an updated list every six months			2
since the initial revelations about surveillance by the @entity51 came to light earlier this year , there has been an uptick in the number of tech companies voluntarily releasing statistics on the government requests they get			1
@entity1 joins @entity58 , @entity59 and other tech companies taking part in a practice that is fast becoming industry standard			1
" @entity1 is so secretive about everything it does , the fact that it is opening up shows that transparency really is the new standard , and the consumers are demanding it , " said @entity64 , a staff attorney with the @entity65			2
though the information in the reports is somewhat standard , @entity1 did included something different			1
the last line under the notes section in the report says , " @entity1 has never received an order under @entity78 of the @entity79			2
we would expect to challenge such an order if served on us			0
" section 215 is the part of the @entity79 the @entity51 could use to compel companies to hand over user data			0
if @entity1 did receive such an order , it would likely be accompanied by a gag order so @entity1 would not even be able to say that it did or did not receive a 215 request			0
@entity64 says this type of disclosure is called a canary , and @entity1 is the first major tech company to include it			2
" six months from now , we will look to make sure that line is included , and if they do n't say they have not received a 215 request , we can assume they have , " said @entity64			0
@entity1 also joined @entity59 and @entity44 and filed a brief in the @entity99 asking for more transparency to discuss government requests openly and in more detail			1
currently , the @entity12 government only allows companies to talk about how many national security orders , including the numbers of accounts impacted , in ranges of thousands			0
" we have reported all the information we are legally allowed to share , and @entity1 will continue to advocate for greater transparency about the requests we receive , " @entity1 said in the report			1
the other information in @entity1 's report was fairly standard			1
it 's difficult to compare @entity1 's numbers directly to those previously disclosed by companies such as @entity58 and @entity44			1
though they 're all technology companies , they are vastly different businesses and store different amounts and types of data about their users			0
" our business does not depend on collecting personal data			0
we have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers , " @entity1 said in the beginning of the report			2
that statement seems to be dig directed at companies such as @entity44 , @entity135 , @entity58 and many others that do base their businesses on collecting their customers ' personal information			0
the hunger for personal data is n't limited to governments as it 's also very lucrative for many technology companies .			0

@entity1 released its first report listing the amount of government requests for information
most of @entity1 's requests were for device information such as tracking down a stolen phone
these types of reports are becoming the standard in the tech industry
