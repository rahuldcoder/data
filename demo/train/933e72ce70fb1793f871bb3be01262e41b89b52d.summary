-- it 's an oval - shaped , bitter tasting leaf that makes you chatty after chewing it , while inducing a feeling of euphoria and alertness			0
the @entity8 plant khat , a mild narcotic , has been chewed for centuries by people in the @entity12 and parts of the @entity14 for its stimulating effects			1
the green leaf is central to cultural and social activities for many communities across the area and key to the economic survival of thousands of khat farmers who grow it legally			2
in recent years , high demand for the herbal stimulant by the @entity31 diaspora -- despite it being illegal in several western countries , including the @entity27 -- has helped open up a booming industry in fertile parts of @entity34 , such as the @entity35			1
but now the livelihood of these farmers is under threat after the @entity39 , which has a vibrant @entity31 community and is a key khat hub to other @entity43 countries , announced a ban on all imports of the plant in january			1
until now , the @entity39 and @entity47 were the only major @entity43 countries allowing the trade and consumption of the flowering shrub			2
" if the ban is accepted or if it is enforced , the whole @entity35 , the economy of the @entity35 will be crippled , " says @entity34 khat farmer @entity51 , who exports the majority of his crops to the @entity54			1
" the economy of the population here where khat is grown will be totally crippled and people will have no source of income , " he adds			2

according to the @entity73 , khat can induce manic behaviors , hyperactivity and hallucinations while chronic abuse can result in symptoms such as physical exhaustion , violence and suicidal depression			0
however , some observers believe that the ban , which is expected to start later this year , has been imposed after suggestions of purported links between the international khat trade and the funding of terrorist groups like @entity89 -- a claim @entity39 officials deny			1
" there are legitimate businesses whose end product may end up in the hands of @entity89 , yet if governments resort to banning these businesses then it hurts the ultimate owners of these businesses , " says analyst @entity92 of the @entity93			0
" i think it is a tricky situation , it is a precarious balancing act -- governments need to think of mechanisms that ensure that these legitimate businesses do n't end up benefiting these terrorist organizations			0
" @entity89 , a militant @entity107 group that controls much of southern @entity31 and is active around the capital @entity109 , has been battling the country 's weak transitional government for years			0

analysts believe that the khat trade in @entity43 may be following a similar pattern			1
they say some of the businessmen in @entity43 who act as middlemen to khat exporters and farmers could be sending the money back to @entity89			0
" so , ultimately , the contributors are doing this in good faith but the end result is that you have people with wrong motives along and in between who take these resources , this money , and channel it to terror organizations , " says @entity92			0
@entity31 analysts @entity140 and @entity142 say the use of international khat trade to fund militant activities has long been suspected by intelligence agencies but evidence is difficult to prove and remains circumstantial			1
they note that the @entity39 ban has been driven by health , socio - economic and local political factors , along with a tougher stance on " softer " drugs , but add that this needs to be balanced against the security context of @entity31 and the increasing prominence of @entity89 in recent years			1
" this is of course a huge concern for the international community in their anti-terrorist operations so any suggested links to the funding of terrorist activities will demand movement for cessation of such activities or pressure to regulate , " says @entity158			2
@entity170 , a @entity171 member of the @entity43 parliament who 's been raising the issue of the drug 's detrimental social and health effects for many years , says that several security services have admitted that there might be a link between @entity89 and illegal khat trade but it is very difficult to track the cash generated by the trade and ultimately know who the end receivers are			1
" they can follow the money to @entity188 and then further into @entity31 but then they really do n't know , " he says			0
in the @entity47 , anti-khat campaigner @entity190 says that @entity89 targets vulnerable young addicts in the @entity47 - @entity31 community for recruitment			0
he says that parts of the multimillion dollar khat trade is being controlled by people " who are very sympathetic to @entity89 " and calls on the @entity47 government to follow the @entity39 ' example and ban the drug			1
" in my opinion , by allowing khat to be legal , @entity47 is providing tools , manpower and resources to @entity89 , " he says			0

" @entity217 farming is the heart of the economy of this place , " says @entity51			0
" we can not educate our children without khat -- if we do n't have khat to sell , this means our economy is grounded			0
" with the @entity34 government having entered talks with the @entity39 government to reverse the ban on khat , the farmers hope the talks will bear fruit or their livelihood will be plucked away			1
" this is only what we know in our life , nothing more , " says @entity51 .			0
