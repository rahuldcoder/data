the scene of devastation is staggering in @entity3 , the town at the heart of the battle between @entity8 forces and @entity10 separatists in recent days			1
barely a house is unscathed by shelling			0
elderly civilians trapped by the fighting still cower in basements			0
after most @entity8 forces pulled out wednesday , the separatists are now in control			1
it 's obvious there 's been a seismic shift on the battlefield			0
but it 's not yet clear what the @entity8 withdrawal means for the shaky peace deal that came into force sunday			1
will the separatists halt their offensive , satisfied with the territory they hold ? or will they be emboldened to push for more ? the leaders of @entity8 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 spoke thursday by phone in an attempt to patch up the deal , rocked by the fierce fighting for control of @entity42 , a strategic railroad hub			1
they called for the ceasefire to be respected along the entire front line and for the withdrawal of heavy weaponry by both sides to create a buffer zone , as agreed to in @entity50 , @entity51			0
but skeptics may wonder whether it 's too late to salvage the deal , hammered out a week ago by the four leaders -- @entity36 's @entity56 , @entity35 's @entity57 , @entity8 's @entity58 and @entity34 's @entity59			1
the ramifications for the @entity61 are huge because the 10 - month - long conflict in eastern @entity8 has hiked tensions with @entity34 to a level not seen since the end of the @entity66 , affecting trade and raising the specter of a @entity34 threat to @entity70			1
@entity2 's @entity71 , who was able to return to @entity42 on thursday after a two - week absence , said the physical change in the town was astounding , with destruction on a wide scale			1
terrified elderly women are still taking shelter in the basement of a building formerly held by @entity8 forces but now in rebel hands , he said			1
humanitarian aid deliveries have started quickly , with food parcels brought in on trucks run by the separatists			0
those still in @entity42 -- a fraction of its former population of 25,000 -- are angered by what has happened to their hometown			2
a @entity8 tank and other destroyed military armor could be seen across the town , and the noise of machine gun fire could be heard , suggesting some @entity8 soldiers are still holed up on the edges of @entity42 , @entity71 said			1
the rumble of shelling also continued , mostly in the distance			0
it 's not clear yet how many civilians , separatist militants or @entity8 soldiers died during the days of fighting for @entity42 or in attempts to leave the town			1
@entity8 leaders claim their troops ' withdrawal was strategic and organized , but the signs indicate that a vastly better equipped separatist force outgunned them and that they came under fire while retreating			1
separatist fighters who spoke to @entity2 said the road out of town was still a contested area			1
@entity119 and the @entity61 accuse @entity34 of arming and training the separatists and sending @entity34 troops over the border to fight with them			2
@entity34 has steadfastly denied the claim			2
@entity42 : inside the ghost town @entity8 's @entity58 has not hesitated to point the finger at @entity34 over the fighting this week in @entity42			1
" the whole world saw that @entity34 does n't adhere to its commitments , " he said after his troops ' hasty retreat			2
" in my telephone conversation with @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity59 i stressed that the situation around @entity42 was in breach of @entity50 accords , " he tweeted a day later			2
according to his office , @entity58 asked for " definite guarantees in case there are further attempts to violate the agreements			0
" the @entity141 , which is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire , has criticized the separatists for refusing to allow its monitors into @entity42			2
@entity145 , the @entity141 spokesman in @entity119 , told @entity2 on thursday that the organization had made contact with both the @entity8 and the separatists regarding access to @entity42			1
separatist leaders in @entity151 and @entity152 said they were unable to provide safe passage for the @entity141 monitors , he said , so " at the moment it is not possible for us to visit the area			2
" @entity58 said all four leaders had agreed in their phone call that the @entity141 should be supported in its mission and that full access should be ensured starting thursday , particularly around @entity152 's airport and in other towns where fighting has occurred in the past hours			0
only after a full ceasefire is achieved will the drawback of heavy weapons start under direct @entity141 observation , he said			0
a statement from @entity57 's office said the leaders had agreed the ceasefire should be in effect on the entire front line without exception			0
the leaders called for an acceleration in the release of prisoners held by both sides , as agreed to under the @entity50 deal			2
@entity58 said this release should include those captured in @entity42			2
a statement from the @entity185 said the leaders had stressed that the start of the implementation of the @entity50 agreement had led to a decrease in military activity in eastern @entity8 and fewer civilian casualties			1
" the leaders emphasized the need of holding a ceasefire , taking real steps to withdraw the heavy weapons and release of prisoners , " it said			0
@entity58 sought to portray his forces ' retreat from @entity42 as organized and orderly , disputing separatists ' claims that the @entity8 troops were surrounded and surrendered their arms			1
the separatists regarded @entity42 as already being their territory when the front lines for the ceasefire were drawn			2
hours after @entity119 pulled its troops out of @entity42 , @entity8 's @entity212 said it would ask for @entity214 peacekeepers to be sent to eastern @entity8			1
but a spokesman for @entity34 's @entity216 , @entity217 , said @entity218 rejects any such call			0
the @entity50 agreement is the basis for the ceasefire and resolution of the conflict , so there 's no need for international monitoring , @entity217 said at a televised briefing			0
he added that the government in @entity119 was responsible for its implementation			0
" we 're convinced the full responsibility of fulfillment of the agreement lies only on the parties of the conflict , " @entity217 said			0
@entity58 said the question of deploying peacekeepers along the front line and the @entity8 - @entity34 border had been included in the @entity50 agenda			1
speaking later thursday in @entity119 , he insisted that @entity34 , given its alleged involvement in the conflict , could not play a role in peacekeeping operations in @entity8			1
" @entity8 will not agree to a peacekeeping format , which threatens to legalize thousands of @entity34 militaries -- we already have enough such ' peacekeepers , ' " he said			1
in a sign of the heightened tensions between @entity34 and other @entity254 nations , @entity250 's @entity249 scrambled fighter jets wednesday after @entity34 aircraft were identified flying close to @entity250 airspace , the @entity248 said			0
" the @entity34 planes were escorted by the @entity249 until they were out of the @entity250 area of interest			0
at no time did the @entity34 military aircraft cross into @entity250 sovereign airspace , " a spokeswoman said			0
@entity250 defence secretary @entity265 told @entity250 's @entity267 newspaper that there 's a " real and present danger " that @entity59 would use murky tactics to destabilize the @entity272 states of @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 , which border @entity34 on @entity277 's eastern flank			0
@entity2 's @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report as did journalist @entity282 in @entity119 .			0
