-- her smiling face is broadcast to more than 20 million @entity3 each month -- yet @entity4 still acts like your small - town @entity6 neighbor			1
she makes sure to ask how you 're doing and what you did for the holidays before getting down to anything business - related			0
" i know the people i 've talked to are really valuing what they have right now , " @entity4 said			1
as co-pastor of @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity6 , with her husband , @entity17 , @entity4 is an inspiration and mentor to many			1
her first book , " @entity21 : @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , " offers busy , distressed women advice on embracing joy			0
and her newly released children 's books ( " @entity29 " and " my happy heart books " ) aim to help kids develop their character and friendships			1
" you know , books are such a great way to spend time with your children , open lines of communication with your children , and just build that strong foundation , " she said			1
@entity0 talked with @entity4 about the uncertain economy , common financial sins , and why encouragement is so important			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity0 : your first book was released in october			0
why did you write it ? who were you hoping to inspire ? @entity4 : i 've talked to so many people after the last 10 years , and i just found that there was a kind of thread that ran through every conversation			1
relationships are people 's no. 1 priorities			1
they want to have good relationships and a lot of times they do n't			0
even in these uncertain times , these economic uncertainties , we have to be able to develop our relationships and our support systems			0
so i addressed a lot of those issues , and just gave practical advice from my life and people i 've talked to			0
so i just hoped to inspire people to just realize their influence , their value , and the fact that they can get even more out of their relationships and enjoy them			0
@entity0 : have you heard many stories about these difficult economic times ? @entity4 : it 's interesting , because we get so much uncertainty and get so stressed out , and i know the people i 've talked to are really valuing what they have right now			1
and they 're starting with their relationships , with their children , with family			1
they 're saying , " i want to focus on them , i do n't want to be so distracted in what 's going on that i ca n't spend time with my family			1
" and i think that 's what happens to us			2
we go through hard times and difficulties and those things seem to pass			0
but our relationships are there for a lifetime			0
in times like this , we need each other and we need to support one another and encourage one another			2
we all need encouragement so it 's good to have that strong support system			2
@entity0 : how is religion affected in times like these ? ... do more people turn to @entity120 for hope ? or do they get discouraged because he 's not doing enough ? @entity4 : you know , sometimes i think these difficult situations can bring us back to what is important and maybe do some things that we should have done before in our life			1
i find that people are coming back to their faith			2
they 're depending on it , and they want to rediscover what 's important			2
so i really think there 's a lot of hope and a lot of encouragement out there			2
and people are wanting to say , you know , " we 're going to get through these tough times , too			0
" and their faith is a key here , it really is			2
@entity0 : what are the main financial " sins " you see ? what do people do over and over again that they could do better ? @entity4 : i think we could all do better sometimes of not overextending ourselves as much			1
it 's easy in our day and age to just extend ourselves in the credit line and things like that , but this [ economic time ] i think will bring people back -- " you know , i need to live within my means and be kind of careful with my money			2
" @entity0 : do you have any advice for those that are suffering with personal finances or job loss ? @entity4 : i would just encourage them to reach into their faith and reach out to @entity120 and to keep their family around them			1
i mean , i just think that is so important to keep a strong support system , to keep yourself encouraged			0
you know , when you get down and discouraged , you do n't see any hope in a situation -- it does n't help you rise above it			0
and another thing ... extend our hand to someone else			0
you might not be able to help financially , but you can help someone maybe by just babysitting their children while they go on a job interview or , you know , just doing the simple things to get outside your own self and your own needs			2
sometimes in need , when you reach out and meet someone else 's need , it 's amazing how it can change the atmosphere around you			1
@entity0 : you travel around the country , spreading an uplifting message			0
how does it affect you to always have to be the positive one ? do you ever get tired of that or feel like things are bringing you down ? @entity4 : well , you know we all have to keep ourselves encouraged			1
i have to encourage myself every day because when you look at what 's going on , you can just look down and say , " what 's happening ? " you know , you can let fear attach itself to you and fear is contagious -- when you get around it , it just seems to build on itself			1
the thing about it is that i 've seen @entity120 do so many miracles for so many people			0
i talk to people everyday who this lord of encouragement has helped them stay above it all , so they can make good decisions			0
@entity120 can lead them in a better direction			0
so because i 've seen @entity120 do so many great things , it just helps me to say , " stay encouraged " and " you can do it , do n't give up			0
" because @entity120 's faithful , and i think that 's what helps me continue to encourage other people .			1
