-- after an agonizing week of waiting , hoping and praying , @entity1 reunited with his 16 - year - old daughter , @entity2 , on sunday , according to a source close to the situation			1
@entity2 was rescued in the @entity6 wilderness after an @entity8 agent shot and killed the family friend suspected of killing her mother and brother , burning his own house down and kidnapping the girl			1
@entity16 's death and @entity2 's rescue late saturday afternoon ended a frantic , weeklong manhunt			1
the girl did not appear to have significant physical injuries , authorities said			0
" it 's now healing time , " the girl 's father said in a text message to @entity0			0
" they did n't fit " @entity2 went missing after cheerleading practice in @entity27 , @entity28 , on august 3			1
the next day , the bodies of her mother , @entity31 , and 8 - year - old brother , @entity33 , were found about 45 miles east in @entity16 's burned house in @entity35			1
that horror spurred a manhunt , which zeroed in on central @entity6 after two critical clues : the discovery of @entity16 's blue @entity40 outside the city of @entity42 and a sighting of the pair by horseback riders			1
one of the horseback riders on sunday described multiple " red flags " that were raised during their brief interaction with the pair , including their brand - new camping equipment and the pajama - like bottoms @entity2 was wearing			1
@entity53 recalled the interaction as " just like a square peg going into a round hole			0
" another rider , @entity58 , said it looked like @entity2 " had a scared look on her face , " adding about @entity16 : " i just had a gut feeling about him			1
" unaware of the @entity66 , however , the horseback riders continued on , and only after seeing a news report on the pair upon returning home did the group put the puzzle pieces together			0
" when i seen that picture on the screen , i told my wife , i said , ' that is the girl that was up on that mountain , ' " @entity53 recalled			0
hundreds of law enforcement agents scoured 300 square miles of rough terrain , hampered by the smoke from nearby wildfires			0
key moments in the manhunt late saturday afternoon , they spotted the pair 's campsite near @entity87 , @entity6			2
but the topography was so steep , helicopters had to drop authorities off far away from the camp			0
hostage rescue teams had to hike more than two hours to get to the scene , local sheriffs ' departments said			0
they moved in carefully so they would n't alert @entity16 that they were coming			1
" once the teams set up , they waited until @entity16 and @entity2 separated and moved in , " the @entity102 and @entity101 sheriffs ' offices said			1
authorities ushered @entity2 to an area where a helicopter could whisk her away			2
at some point , a " confrontation " ensued between authorities and @entity16 , @entity109 @entity108 said			2
the confrontation ended when an @entity8 tactical agent shot and killed the murder and kidnapping suspect			1
" obviously we would have liked for mr. @entity16 to surrender and face justice in the court of law , " @entity108 said			2
" but that 's not going to be the case			0
" ' @entity2 is safe ' @entity2 did n't appear to have significant physical injuries , but was immediately taken to a hospital , the sheriff 's spokeswoman said			2
" @entity2 is safe , and that was our first priority from the very beginning , " @entity102 , @entity6 , sheriff @entity127 said			1

" i am nervous excited saddened 4 my wife and son and worried what my daughter has been through , " he wrote			0
father of missing teen pleads for daughter 's release witness : @entity16 had crush a friend of @entity16 detailed the relationship she observed between @entity16 and the teen			2
@entity155 told @entity0 that she was in a car with @entity2 and @entity16 , 40 , a few months ago when he told @entity2 he had a crush on her			1
he followed it up by saying if he was her age , he would date @entity2 , @entity158 said			2
@entity2 was unnerved by the comments , but did not tell her mother because she did not want to ruin the close relationship that her parents had with @entity16 , @entity158 said			1
but @entity2 did not want to be alone with @entity16 after that , @entity158 said			1
" i do n't think she would have gone willingly with him at all , " she said			0
in an earlier episode , @entity158 recalled a trip that @entity16 and @entity2 took to @entity169			1
the trip was supposed to be for one week , but @entity2 told @entity158 that they came back after two days because @entity16 was upset that she was n't paying enough attention to him			1
search intensified after car spotted @entity16 's car was found after @entity53 reported he had a brief conversation with two campers in the @entity6 wilderness on wednesday			1
