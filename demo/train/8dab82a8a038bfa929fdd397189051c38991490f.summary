@entity0 -- president @entity2 said thursday night that it " may be appropriate " for him to appoint a czar to lead his administration 's response to @entity7			1
" it may make sense for us to have one person ... so that after this initial surge of activity , we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we 're crossing all the @entity15 's and dotting all the i 's going forward , " @entity2 said			1
his comments to reporters in the @entity19 came after a meeting @entity22 director @entity21 , homeland security adviser @entity23 and others			2
@entity2 pointed to those two as the leaders of the @entity27 response to @entity7 so far			0
he said they 've done an " outstanding job " so far , but that with flu season coming and @entity35 officials also involved in combatting @entity36 , " they also are responsible for a whole bunch of other stuff			1
" @entity2 also said he has no " philosophical objection " to a ban on travel between @entity40 and the @entity27			1
but said that doing so could make it tougher to determine whether passengers entering the @entity27 from elsewhere had recently visited the region that 's at the epicenter of the @entity7 outbreak			0
he said a " flat - out travel ban is not the way to go " and that it 's less effective than other steps the @entity27 has already taken			2
some lawmakers have clamored in recent days for a travel ban , arguing that the @entity27 should be able to track international passengers from the origins of their flights			0
" you ought to look at at least immediately suspending visas for non- @entity27 nationals , " @entity55 rep. @entity54 of @entity56 told @entity2 administration officials at a @entity59 hearing thursday .			0

@entity21 of the @entity22 and @entity23 of @entity35 have led effort so far
president @entity2 says flu season and @entity36 will also demand their attention
" it may make sense for us to have one person " *coordinating* effort , @entity2 says
@entity2 has no " philosophical objection " to @entity40 travel ban , but is *n't* *leaning* that way
