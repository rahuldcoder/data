-- one of the lesser - known things done by @entity4 's @entity3 left - wing government during its short rule was to legalize abortion			1
banned under @entity8 , abortion was allowed again in 1985 , and in 2010 legal abortion was extended radically by the left - wing @entity11 government			2
in recent years , hundreds of thousands of @entity4 have taken to the streets to demand an end to @entity4 's laissez - faire abortion culture			1
the current conservative government is now promoting a bill which restricts -- albeit with significant compromises -- legal abortion			2
among protests against the bill , topless activists called " @entity20 " threw bloodstained underwear at @entity25 's cardinal - archbishop as he visited a @entity25 parish			0
contrasting view : @entity4 ' heading for self - made mess ' with abortion ban if , as predicted , the bill is passed , abortion will no longer be regarded in law as a " right " but as a crime			1
this classification is not a draconian throwback to a previous age : today abortion remains part of the criminal law in many @entity41 jurisdictions , even in places with high rates of legally - permitted abortion such as @entity45			2
two other elements of the proposed @entity4 law which mirror the @entity45 abortion law relate to doctors : a requirement that two doctors are necessary to authorize an abortion in most cases , and a right of conscientious objection for those doctors who reject abortion			1
these three elements send a message that abortion is not merely a medical procedure but an act of grave moral significance for all involved : doctors , mothers and unborn children			1
there is nothing in international human rights law which denies or downgrades a human being 's right to life based on physical development			1
if we recognize that unborn children are human beings , then we must recognize that abortion is @entity4 's leading cause of death			1
even advocates of legal abortion admit that unborn children are human beings			1
those advocates , however , draw arbitrary lines on legal personhood and therefore the right to life : some at 12 weeks after conception , some at 24 weeks , some at birth and a few even years after birth			0
there is , however , no solid foundation for such lines			0
a human being has at the moment of conception the same genetic identity throughout life			0
this is why some pro-lifers like myself have reservations about the proposed law			2
the bill enshrines a compromise without a rational basis			0
abortion would still be allowed when doctors diagnose a threat to the mother 's health or when following an allegation that the baby was conceived in a non-consensual act			0
when a danger is detected to the mother 's health , the correct way for doctors to proceed is to " kill " the danger , not kill the child			0
abortion does n't cure any illnesses or treat any conditions			0
just as we do n't kill children after birth if caring for them may involve a danger to the mother 's health , we should n't kill them before birth either			0
when a woman has been made pregnant through rape , an abortion punishes an innocent person -- the child			1
it does n't unrape the mother			0
studies and surveys suggest that many , if not most , women made pregnant through sexual assault do not choose abortion and are glad they did n't			0
there is evidence , albeit not yet conclusive , which suggests that legal abortion may pose an additional health risk for women			1
a recent meta - analysis of 36 studies of @entity150 women suggests a link between abortion and breast cancer			0
the research of @entity156 's professor @entity155 , who supports a legal right to abortion , suggests a significant link between abortion and negative mental health outcomes			2
today @entity4 is an aging nation with one of the world 's lowest birth - rates			2
estimates suggest that in a few years deaths ( of born people ) will outnumber births			0
the @entity4 can not afford to continue to regard children as burdensome optional extras			2
in the @entity173 , the @entity172 population continues to grow in size and significance			0
it is an absurd irony that @entity4 's native population has been declining just as their ethnic brethren have been advancing in the world 's richest nation			1
despite the new bill 's compromises , i welcome its recognition of the equality of disabled human beings through the proposed deletion of disability as a ground for abortion			1
the revival of eugenics has been one of the most retrograde trends in recent decades , a sinister shadow of those dark pre- 1945 years in which science was abused to justify eliminating so - called " lives unworthy of life			0
" no unborn child is unworthy of legal protection against abortion : for we were all unborn children once			1

@entity4 's proposed abortion law would restrict abortion to rape **victim*s* or women who would suffer lasting harm
@entity210 says no unborn child is unworthy of legal protection against abortion
having an abortion does not " unrape " a rape *victim* , he says , or cure an illness
@entity210 says if unborn children are human beings , then abortion is @entity4 's leading cause of death
