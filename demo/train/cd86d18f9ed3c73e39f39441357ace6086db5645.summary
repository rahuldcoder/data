for many of us , the holiday season is a time to count our blessings -- and then open our hearts and our checkbooks to those who have far less than we do			2
but for a handful of extraordinary leaders , giving means something more			1
it means committing their entire beings to bettering the lives of others			1
it means looking at the most wrenching problems all around them and saying it does n't have to be this way			1
and it means innovating -- truly leading -- to find new solutions to our oldest and most vexing challenges			1
modifying the homes of disabled veterans so they can live fuller , more productive lives			2
creating vital support and transportation networks for children undergoing chemotherapy			1
providing free medical care in the jungles of @entity35 , where it 's not just unattainable , it 's often unheard of			2
launching a mobile computer lab to help low - income students in @entity39 keep up with essential , job - sustaining technologies			1
these are just some of the ways in which the @entity43 are embodying the very best of giving and philanthropy			1
at a time of government dysfunction and global economic turmoil , these women and men are n't wringing their hands			1
they 're rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done -- quietly , courageously , all around the world			2
how can we support and encourage even more of these efforts ? in my time as a philanthropist , i 've thought a great deal about this issue			0
and i 've found that while money is , of course , essential , in the end it has surprisingly little to do with effective philanthropy			2
leadership is the key ingredient			0
that 's why we 've stopped focusing our giving on needs and started focusing it much more on leadership			1
i believe the future of philanthropy depends on this shift -- on a leadership - based approach to solving our public problems			1
the truth is , virtually all of the more than 1.5 million nonprofits in @entity83 are trying to meet important needs			0
at the @entity85 , i 've rarely questioned the need of a nonprofit that came to us for help			1
but need is n't enough			0
need does n't get the job done			0
need does n't inspire others to follow your example			0
need does n't break out of the often - stale approaches of the past			2
true dynamism in an organization does			0
what do i mean when i use the word " vision ? " i mean people like the @entity43 , who look at an old problem and immediately see it in a brand new way			1
people who think far beyond our day - to - day crises , as important as they are , and think about how their work will shape and sustain a community for the long haul			2
people who understand their work as a cause , even a calling -- and can rally others to embrace it			0
to me , vision is nothing less than a road map to the future			2
and if you have a real vision , you can outlast and outperform those with far greater resources and support			2
which is why visionaries tend to be good philanthropic investments			0
of course , vision means little if you ca n't run an effective nonprofit			1
that 's why we also look for dynamic organizations -- ones that are n't weighted down by bureaucracy and turf wars , and in particular , ones in which the board and the executive director are working hand in hand			0
without the red tape and the interoffice battles , they deliver better and more meaningful results			0
it sounds simple , but you 'd be surprised how elusive this can be			0
at the @entity85 , we do n't just go looking for these kinds of strong , leadership - driven nonprofits			1
we try to nurture and grow them as well			0
that 's why we created the @entity158 program , which we are offering free to all current and past @entity43			1
@entity158 has already trained over 1,400 nonprofit leaders in this country , helping them approach their work with a greater sense of vision and helping them build closer bonds between their boards and their executive management , so their effectiveness can match their level of need			1
so if you want your own charitable dollars to have the greatest impact , do n't just write checks to a worthy cause			0
support the people and organizations that are actually leading us forward			0
i believe that 's the best way to create a stronger , fairer , more just world			0
and that 's something we can all embrace , this and every holiday season .			0
