president @entity0 won the 2012 presidential election by accumulating some of the most one - sided electoral constituencies in modern political history			1
looking at a breakdown of the 2012 election exit polling , @entity0 won the 18 - to 29 - year - old vote 60 % to 37 % , in spite of the fact that half of all recent college graduates are unemployed or underemployed			0
he won women by 11 points and unmarried women by an incredible 36 points			0
the marriage gap was far greater than the gender gap			2
@entity0 won african - americans with 93 % of the vote , virtually unchanged from the 95 % he won in 2008			0
latinos , one of the fastest growing demographics , went 71 % to 27 % in favor of @entity0			0
and he won with @entity22 by a similarly enormous margin			0
among those who make less than $ 50,000 a year , @entity0 won 60 % to 38 %			0
@entity25 : ' stop being the stupid party ' @entity28 , on the other hand , won white voters 59 % to 39 % and those making over $ 50,000 a year by 53 % to 45 %			2
this was the drumbeat of the @entity0 campaign			0
to women they said : @entity36 are waging a " war on women , " trying to outlaw abortion and contraception and would take them back to their rights in the 1950s			1
to minorities they said : @entity36 are anti-government services , cold - blooded individualists , and can not represent minority communities			1
to middle and low income @entity46 they said : @entity36 are the party of the rich , who will slash taxes for only the richest @entity46 and cut social safety nets for the poor			1
rather than offer a broad sweeping vision for the country , @entity53 played identity politics			1
republicans were the culprits , and women , young adults , black , latinos , etc.			2
why ? for the same reason this litany -- gender , race , ethnicity , class -- sound so familiar			1
opinion : democrats , do n't get too cocky voters believed it , not because it was something new or groundbreaking , but because this has been the template of many of our character - building institutions -- our public schools , our colleges , and public universities -- for the past 50 years			1
go to any major university in @entity46 and this is the mindset that is taught , preached , and ingested			2
it also gets an assist from television drama , from the movies , and from much of the mainstream media			0
for decades liberals have succeeded in defining the national discourse , the terms of discussion , and , therefore , the election , in these terms			1
they have successfully set the parameters and focus of the national and political dialogue as predominantly about gender , race , ethnicity , and class			1
this is the paradigm , the template through which many @entity46 , probably a majority , more or less view the world , our country , and the election			0
it is a divisive strategy and @entity53 have targeted and exploited those divides			2
poll : fiscal cliff headache for middle class how else can we explain that more young people now favor socialism to capitalism ? according to a @entity120 poll taken last year , 49 % of @entity46 age 18 - 29 have a positive view of socialism while just 46 % have a positive view of capitalism			0
such a view has roots			0
so while we @entity36 opine about election strategies and changing demographics , and appropriately so as that is our immediate order of business , in the long run we must address the problem at its source : the culture			2
politics are downstream from the culture			0
@entity138 summarized the two most important questions in a society : who teaches the young and what do we teach them ? for the past 50 years liberals have had majority control of the character - forming institutions			1
if the national dialogue stays on their terms -- gender , race , ethnicity , class -- republicans will continue to lose			1
opinion : failure to attract millennials is sinking the @entity36 we must counter the discourse and speak and educate in terms of family , faith , freedom , principle , values , work , country , community , improvement , growth , and equality of opportunity			1
no longer can the @entity36 be solely the party of business			2
who controls the terms of discussion , dialogue , and education controls the country and , therefore , the election			0
it 's time for @entity36 to take it back			1
this will require much work and time , but there is no more important business .			0

@entity187 : @entity53 played identity politics in the presidential race
@entity187 : voters believed it because they have been preached at for the past 50 years
he says liberals succeeded in focusing national discourse on gender , race , etc.
@entity187 : it 's time for @entity36 to begin *framing* political and cultural discussions
