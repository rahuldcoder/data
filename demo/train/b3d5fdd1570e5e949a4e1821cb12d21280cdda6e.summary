there 's no arguing that @entity2 set the standard for modern mobile devices with the @entity5 and the @entity6			1
it did n't take long after those two products launched for competitors to rush out their own copycat devices			0
even then , it took another few years before @entity12 was good enough to go toe to toe with @entity14 , @entity2 's mobile operating system			1
but it 's no longer about being just as good as @entity2			2
you have to be better			0
competitors have built upon the foundation @entity2 laid in mobile and are now leapfrogging it with bunch of useful features you ca n't find on iphones and @entity6			1
the evidence is everywhere , but it 's most apparent in products made by @entity2 's biggest mobile rival , @entity26			1
by now , @entity26 's @entity28 devices have become synonymous with @entity12 , to the point that the manufacturer has more brand recognition than any other phone or tablet running @entity35 's operating system			1
a lot of that has to do with @entity26 's massive marketing budget , but you ca n't ignore the fact that the company has innovated a lot by creating popular new product categories that @entity2 is wary to try			1
the best example of this is the @entity46 , a smartphone - tablet hybrid with a giant screen			2
when that device first hit the @entity52 about a year ago , critics ( including me ) slammed the device for being too large			0
it could n't fit comfortably in your pocket			0
and it came with a stylus , that relic of the @entity61 era , making the @entity46 feel like a step backward			0
@entity26 sold at least 10 million @entity65			0
the company came out with an updated version with an even larger screen called the @entity69 a few months later and sold another 5 million ( at last count ) , a very big achievement for a single @entity12 device			0
but more importantly , @entity26 created a new category of smartphone that people did n't even know they wanted , much like @entity2 did when it released the first @entity5			1
@entity26 is n't afraid to tout its cool factor either			2
since the first commercial debuted in late 2011 , you 've probably seen those " @entity83 " ads that make fun of starry - eyed @entity2 fans waiting in line for the next @entity5			1
whether it 's boasting about the bigger screens or sharing content by tapping phones together , @entity26 seems content to blast @entity2 for its stuffiness while showing in a practical context what its devices can do			1
on the software side of things , @entity26 is taking advantage of its mobile devices ' processing power to layer premium features on top of @entity12 , such as the ability to run two apps at once in a split screen or separate window			1
@entity26 's best tablet , the @entity102 , can do all that plus take advantage of a stylus so you can draw and take notes on the screen			2
there is a downside to the split - screen thing , however			0
developers have to tweak their apps to work in split - screen mode on the @entity102			0
there are only about 20 apps right now that can do it			0
but what 's most important is how nimble @entity26 has become at improving its mobile devices through software updates			1
the note 10.1 launched last fall , but it received a software update with a new version of @entity12 and a slew of other features like the voice assistant @entity127 , which is a lot more impressive than @entity2 's original @entity129			1
@entity26 's director of product planning , @entity130 , said the company takes user and reviewer feedback into account when preparing to deliver new software updates			1
instead of making users wait a year for new features , @entity130 said @entity26 can use that feedback to deliver " incremental innovation that keeps the product alive			2
" " we want to keep the product relevant to consumers , " @entity130 said			0
" it 's about how to fit our devices into people 's lives versus changing their behavior			2
" @entity26 is n't alone , of course			2
@entity152 's new @entity151 operating system is built for touchscreen devices like tablets , too , and it offers a lot of advantages over @entity14			0
all @entity151 apps can run in a split screen so you can run two at once , plus the main menu is capable of displaying real - time updates for stuff like news and weather			0
@entity152 even has its own line of @entity168 tablets that blur the line between pc and laptop thanks to a clever snap - on keyboard cover			0
based on all this evidence , @entity2 feels behind			0
take a look at its newest fourth - generation @entity6			2
it has a killer processor and other great hardware features , but the operating system does n't take advantage of any of that			0
the home screen is still just a grid of static icons that launch apps			0
@entity2 also is n't nearly as versatile at adding new software features to its devices			1
@entity2 usually makes users wait a year or more for a new version of @entity14 , and even then some older devices ca n't access all the latest and greatest features			1
@entity2 ceo @entity190 likes to say tablets -- not laptops -- are the future of computing , yet it feels like @entity2 's software goes out of its way to limit what you can do on the machine			1
meanwhile there are others , especially @entity26 , that appear to be innovating at a pace faster than @entity2 can			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0

mobile - *gadget* rivals are leapfrogging @entity2 with useful features not on @entity5 , @entity6
this *success* is most apparent with @entity2 's biggest mobile rival , @entity26
@entity26 is more nimble than @entity2 at improving its devices through software updates
with @entity46 , @entity26 has a category of phone people did n't know they wanted
