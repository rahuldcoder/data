-- a powerful earthquake struck early saturday off the coast of northern @entity3 -- rattling nerves in a region rocked three years ago by a deadly tremor , tsunami and nuclear crisis , though thankfully the latest episode did n't nearly measure up			1
the @entity10 at one point issued a tsunami warning , which it later amended to tsunami advisories for coastal regions in @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity18 prefectures			1
the latter is the site of the @entity22 nuclear power facility that was the center of a weeks - long radioactive crisis			0
but a large tsunami never materialized			0
at 6:15 a.m. saturday ( 5:15 p.m. et friday ) , the same agency noted that all tsunami advisories had been canceled			1
whereas before the @entity10 urged everyone to " get out of the water and leave the coast immediately , " that last update was less alarming			0
" pay attention when fishing , swimming or engaging in other activities , " the agency noted , " as there may still be slight sea - level changes for the time being			1
" the @entity10 characterized the quake as a 6.8 - magnitude			2
yet the @entity40 had it a little weaker , downgrading its earlier estimate in calling it a 6.5 - magnitude tremor			1
according to the @entity40 , the quake was centered off @entity46 island some 129 kilometers ( 79 miles ) east - southeast of @entity47 and 284 kilometers east - northeast of @entity48			1
it was 11 kilometers , or 7 miles , deep			0
there were no immediate reports of damage			0
any sizable tremor in or near @entity3 -- and any tsunami warning -- inevitably raises dark memories dating to march 11 , 2011 , when a 9.0 - magnitude struck 231 miles northeast of @entity48			1
that quake , the fourth largest on record since 1900 and the largest ever to hit @entity3 , produced a tsunami with 30 - foot waves when all was over , the combination of the quake and , especially , the tsunami left some 16,000 people dead			2
the event also set off a prolonged crisis at the @entity22 nuclear power plant in the northern part of @entity46 , including the spread of some radioactive material and very real fears of an even worse calamity as authorities tried to bring the dangerous situation under control			0
a repeat of that situation seemed unlikely after the early saturday earthquake			0
a spokesperson for @entity78 , the utility company that controls the @entity22 facility , told @entity0 there were no disruptions to operations at the plant and that everything was operating normally			2
fast facts : 2011 @entity3 earthquake and tsunami @entity0 's @entity88 and @entity89 contributed to this report .			0
