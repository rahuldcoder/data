-- watching the returns in key congressional and gubernatorial races on election night , you might be forgiven for thinking the 2014 midterm elections were a slam dunk for @entity8 , with voters roundly endorsing not only conservative candidates but also conservative ideas			1
but that means you have n't paid attention to the ballot measures			2
in votes on everything from " fetal personhood " amendments to the minimum wage , voters even in the reddest of red states sided with the progressive camp			1
as @entity29 of @entity30 succinctly summed it up in an election night tweet : " so voters want a higher minimum wage , legal pot , abortion access and @entity8 representation			1
" here 's a look at the befuddling outcomes in ballot measure contests , contrasted with the other results on @entity36 , and what they might portend for the future			1
minimum wage voters in three states -- @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 -- voted to approve increases in their state minimum wage rates			1
in @entity44 , for instance , voters decided to raise the state minimum wage from the current federal minimum of just $ 7.25 an hour to $ 8.00 in 2015 and $ 9.00 in 2016			1
in @entity45 , voters approved a measure to raise the federal minimum wage up to $ 8.50 next year , and after that have their minimum wage increase with inflation			1
voters in @entity59 are also expected to approve a similar measure			0
and in @entity62 , voters backed a nonbinding measure encouraging lawmakers to raise the minimum wage in that state			1
this happened even as the same voters chose to send republicans to @entity70 and their state capitols -- the same @entity8 who have been blocking minimum wage legislation			1
confused ? perhaps the voters were , too			0
for instance , in @entity59 , enthusiasm for raising the minimum wage was so strong going into the election that @entity8 @entity79 candidate @entity78 reversed his previous position opposing the minimum wage hike and came out in support of the ballot measure			1
as @entity88 wrote in the @entity89 , anticipating these votes , " it shows , once again , that the @entity86 people want to see genuinely progressive reforms " -- even when , vexingly , they are n't voting for progressive candidates			1
marijuana legalization either because @entity94 is the most influential political voice in @entity86 or because weed is really , really popular -- or maybe both -- @entity98 and @entity70 , both passed ballot measures to legalize the use and possession of small amounts of marijuana			1
voters in @entity59 were expected to approve a similar measure			0
meanwhile , voters in at least three @entity107 cities backed measures to remove fines for small amounts of marijuana possession ( as have other @entity107 cities in past elections )			1
and while voters in @entity118 , @entity119 , voted against pot legalization , the city of @entity115 just down the road voted to endorse legalization			1
the main buzz kill was in @entity123 , where a constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana failed to garner the 60 % of votes needed to pass			2
the measure got just 58 % support			0
and finally in @entity130 , where weed is already legal , voters debated the next burning topic : how to tax it			0
as of this writing , the results of the @entity70 measure were , let 's just say , hazy			2
restrictions on pregnant women it 's distinctly possible that conservatives in @entity141 were high when the proposed a so - called " fetal personhood " ballot measure			1
similar measures already failed on the ballot in 2008 and 2010 but that did n't stop extremists from trying again			2
they put a measure on the ballot to amend the @entity141 state constitution to include fetuses in the definition of " person " and " child " in the state 's criminal code , a change that would unleash all kinds of dangerous ramifications not only for reproductive freedom in the state , but for fertility treatments , birth control and the basic rights of pregnant women			1
thankfully , yet again , @entity141 's " personhood " amendment failed by an almost 2 - to - 1 margin			2
oddly , @entity141 voters elected @entity8 @entity170 , who co-sponsored and defended similar " personhood " legislation -- though @entity170 tried to run away from his anti-abortion stance late in the race			1
also tuesday night , a similar measure to restrict the rights of pregnant women was struck down by a roughly 2 - to - 1 margin in @entity178 -- a state that @entity179 won in 2012 by a similar margin			1
in @entity183 , by a 54 - 46 % margin , voters did approve a measure to modify the state 's constitution to explicitly restrict abortion rights and give state legislators unfettered power to regulate -- and ban -- abortion services			2
there are already stringent restrictions on abortion in @entity183 but not codified in the state 's constitution			1
now the state constitution designed expressly to protect the rights and liberties of all @entity199 has been severely altered to deny rights to women in the state and restrict the basic freedom to control their own bodies			2
gun safety a little over a week before the election , a student in @entity208 , @entity70 , opened fire inside a high school , shooting five classmates			0
three of the victims died , as did the shooter , who took his own life			0
this undoubtedly was fresh in the mind of @entity130 voters as they considered two competing ballot measures in the election : one to require background checks on all gun sales , including those bought at gun shows and online , the other to prevent the state from passing any background checks measures unless or until the federal government does so first			2
voters passed the first measure and rejected the second			2
polling before the vote found that support for expanding background checks increased following the shooting			0
hopefully , other states wo n't wait for mass atrocities before enacting similar common - sense gun safety laws			0
meanwhile , voters in @entity244 and @entity245 passed constitutional amendments codifying the right of people in those states to " hunt , fish and harvest wildlife			2
" as if doing so were somehow in jeopardy			0
but in the context of laws to promote safe access and ownership to guns , both measures were cast in a political context -- and both were supported by the @entity262			0
criminal justice reform voters in @entity265 backed a major change in the state 's criminal justice code			0
minor drug and theft charges will now be considered misdemeanors instead of felonies and come with shorter prison sentences -- a maximum of one year in jail instead of three years under current law			0
the change will affect 1 in 5 of those incarcerated in the state who are sentenced for minor drug possession or writing bad checks			0
thousands will be able to petition to have their sentences immediately reduced			0
the ballot measure was supported by everyone from @entity287 and his @entity288 to @entity289 to @entity0 's own @entity290 , all of whom think @entity265 has better things to spend its money on than warehousing citizens for petty offenses			0
gambling voters in @entity299 voted not to repeal a 2011 law that allowed gambling in the state , in effect revoking the license of three already - operating casinos there			0
@entity265 voters looked likely to reject an off - reservation casino by one @entity309 tribe			0
and @entity141 voters rejected a measure to allow expanded betting at horse tracks -- which is probably a good thing being that it 's @entity141 , the first state to legalize marijuana			0
though it is presumably still legal for @entity317 to informally bet on whether the horses are high .			0

@entity320 : results of ballot initiatives favored progressive outcomes , defied @entity8 sweep
three states voted to hike minimum wage even as they elected @entity8 candidates
several states voted to legalize possession of small amounts of pot
@entity320 : restrictions on pregnant women failed in 2 states , passed in @entity183
