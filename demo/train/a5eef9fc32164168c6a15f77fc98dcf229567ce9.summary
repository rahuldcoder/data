-- imagine if a streetlamp knew you were coming			1
it could announce your arrival from a distance			2
if you were on a date , it could help set the mood			2
it could ring in the new year with dazzling effects , change color at will , even announce days in advance when its bulb was set to blow			2
in fact , there is nothing future - tense about this fantastical vision ; in a handful of municipalities in @entity21 , streetlights have become downright chatty			1
the system is called @entity23			1
it was invented by @entity26 designer @entity25 while a student at @entity28 in the @entity26			2
when flying overseas , he noticed streetlamps lighting streets that , in the middle of the night , were empty and desolate			2
" i started researching , " he says			0
" i wondered , why are they burning ? how much does it cost ? is this a problem ? i discovered some amazing numbers			0
" read more : 12 amazing designs from the past 100 years @entity25 found that @entity21 pays over â ‚ ¬ 10 billion ( $ 13 billion ) a year powering streetlights , which accounts for more than 40 % of government energy bills			1
this translates into 40 million tons of co2 emissions annually -- enough to power 20 million cars			1
his solution was to create an intelligent , " on - demand " lighting system using wireless sensors			1
streetlights only light up in the presence of a person , bicycle or car , and remain dim the rest of the time			1
@entity25 has also developed the technology to distinguish between people and smaller animals , like cats and mice , so it would avoid lighting up unnecessarily			1
" i thought , why should each citizen pay for street lights that are n't being used ? we now have a solution for that			1
" spurred on by his professors , @entity25 entered the concept in a campus competition and won			0
@entity28 handed over their facilities and gave him the financial backing to create a demonstration on campus			0
since then , @entity69 has been implemented in four municipalities in @entity71 and one in @entity73 , with many more to come			1
" we have enquiries from @entity75 , @entity76 , the @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
the problem is not a lack of enquiries , it 's the team 's capacity to deliver the solution worldwide , " he says			0
read more : technology of tomorrow @entity88 reckons the system will slash energy costs and co2 emissions by 80 % , and maintenance by another 50 % , thanks to the integrated wireless sensor that allows lamps to alert a central control center when it 's time to be serviced			1
@entity23 's primary purpose is to conserve energy			1
but when @entity0 invited @entity26 artist @entity101 to offer advice as a mentor for @entity25 , he pointed to the technology 's more artistic potential			1
" how can we use the technology to make environments more human ? more sustainable ? more natural ? " asks @entity101			0
" we want to make it like it 's your friend , or it 's an animal , or it does things you do n't know about			0
it 's not just a machine with a feedback loop , but something that has its own intelligence and is willing to negotiate , to hack you in the same way you hack it			0
" so , for example , an ambulance or fire truck could communicate with the lamps to make them flicker red before they drive through			0
read more : the bright world of electric paint " it could save the ambulance two minutes because the light could tell everyone it 's coming , and they could move aside more quickly because we control the streets , we control the lamps , " says @entity25			2
" it could save a life			0
" @entity101 suggests the uses could be " pragmatic or super poetic			0
" " imagine i can write a piece of software , so when i take my girlfriend out for a walk , it does something special , and wow , you have this boulevard of interactive lights , " he adds			1
it is the type of thinking that garners endless scenarios			0
depending on the occasion , streetlamps can flicker and change color to create any number of designs			0
@entity25 envisions that during a live sporting event , a street could even spell out the score			2
" this is not just about saving electricity , it 's not just about the medium , it 's about the message , and what you want it to generate , " says @entity101 .			0

@entity69 is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people , cars and bicycles
new system could slash energy bills by 80 % in cities around the world
@entity21 spends $ 13 billion annually on fueling street lights
