-- fashion lovers crowded into a limestone townhouse on the prestigious @entity3 of @entity4 on wednesday night for an exclusive designer showcase			2
the house did n't belong to posh members of the high fashion elite , but to the consulate general of the @entity10			1
the @entity10 @entity11 and @entity12 is one of several nationally - driven shows at @entity15 promoting textile and apparel production unique to the countries			1
upcoming shows will highlight the best in material and design from @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , but wednesday night was all about the @entity10			1
the evening embodied the @entity31 zeitgeist ; chandeliers dripped with crystal , women glided about draped in fur , well - tailored men straightened their pocket squares as they passed gilded mirrors			2
the crowd sipped vodka and ogled designs from a conglomerate of modern @entity10 designers , including @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
@entity49 figure skater @entity48 , who has his eyes on a third @entity51 , in the @entity10 city of @entity53 , stopped in and posed for photos			1
@entity31 's storied history was on display : a model 's hair was mussed into a babushka headpiece ; another stood with the rigid posture of a ballerina in laser - cut leather ; all of them wore black outfits reflective of the country 's harsh climate and lack of sunshine			1
" @entity4 itself and , by default , @entity15 is an avowedly international forum where everyone is welcomed and , for the most part , accepted , " said @entity70 , the founder and editor in chief of @entity74 magazine , which co-sponsored the event			1
" it 's a new type of communication channel to promote national interests : fashion , culture , tourism			0
" @entity70 said the @entity49 fashion consumer is the perfect client for any ambitious designer			0
high - style buyers are , on average , well - educated professionals with lots of disposable income			2
not only is the @entity49 consumer a draw to international outlets , but @entity4 is a global fashion capital on par with @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
" the @entity49 market is , simply , among the biggest , and they 're very creative			0
as much as we can celebrate the savoir - faire of the @entity25 , i think @entity49 are the most creative , " said @entity103 , a senior manager of @entity104			0
the @entity107 in @entity108 is showing a collaborative collection sponsored by @entity104 , the @entity110 , on friday at @entity111 in an effort to boost the profile of @entity25 mills in the @entity49			2
the collaboration was launched after approximately 250 meters of fabric was donated by @entity25 mills to the university , according to @entity119			0
@entity103 said the appeal of partnering @entity25 textiles with @entity49 students is that @entity49 designers are typically more open to new fabrics and new ideas			1
" the @entity49 market knows what 's good and what 's selling ; they 're visionaries , " she said			0

during @entity132 's show at @entity141 last september , @entity139 designer @entity138 showcased for the first time			1

eight @entity24 brands will showcase @entity24 leather products , hoping to highlight the designers ' craftsmanship , said @entity164 , a spokesman for the event			1
while the country 's economy is flagging , new prime minister @entity166 has recently advocated stimulating growth by increasing exports ; a somewhat contentious strategy because it could correlate with a depreciation of @entity24 's currency			0
" the @entity24 yen is expensive now , so that is not good for exporting , but the brands are trying everything they can to make it better , " said @entity164			0
rounding out the globe , there 's a @entity26 showcase with designers @entity188 „ , @entity183 and @entity184 making their debut to the @entity49 market			1
also showing is @entity189 , a label working to increase trade with @entity192 that was launched in 2005 by @entity193 and her husband , @entity197 frontman @entity196			0
while it 's common practice for government - run organizations to participate in international trade shows like @entity205 and @entity206 , governments actively orchestrating @entity15 events is a recent development			1
" that 's why everyone who actually wants to sell clothes flocks here vying for interest of the best buyers and best media , " said @entity70			0
" it is a perfect mix to launch a new brand , revamp heavyweights or showcase any country 's fashion industry potential			2
" follow @entity220 on @entity221 and @entity222 on @entity223 for dispatches from @entity15 .			1
