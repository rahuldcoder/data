-- the massive tornado that devastated communities in @entity3 monday touched down near the town of @entity5 just five minutes after the first warnings went out , according to the @entity7			2
but residents of @entity10 , which would be hardest hit by the killer storm , had about 30 minutes before the twister entered the western part of the city , @entity0 meteorologist @entity8 said tuesday			1
it sounds like enough time to act , but in the wake of tragedy , the question always persists : could more have been done to warn residents of the monster tornado ? the science and technology behind severe weather prediction continues to improve , and many of the tools in place were deployed during monday 's tornado			1
once the tornado had touched down and meteorologists had determined that it was heading toward a populated area , the @entity7 issued a " tornado emergency , " said @entity34 , a research meteorologist at the @entity36 's @entity35 in @entity37 , @entity3 , which is near @entity10			1
the rarely used distinction is designed to make it clear that there is a dangerous situation			0
@entity10 in bull 's - eye twice , science may know why " when you hear that , the response is that you better get your act together , now , " @entity34 said			1
for the citizens of @entity10 , the tornado emergency was declared at 3:01 p.m. , about 14 minutes before the tornado reached the city			1
" i think it was a very well - warned and well - forecasted event , " @entity34 said			2
@entity53 tornadoes are terrifying perfect storms the initial warning , which included the counties where @entity5 and @entity10 are located , would have been followed by alerts on television , radio , phone apps and sirens			1
once forecasters recognized that the tornado was violent and that a " potentially extraordinary event was occurring , " the emergency declaration set off another round of warnings , @entity34 said			1
still , at least 24 people lost their lives as a result of the tornado			2
considering the size of the tornado and the number of homes it affected , the death toll could have been worse , @entity34 said			2
" a lot of people survived the path of the tornado , " he said			2
basements scarce in tornado - prone area : here 's why the science behind predictions currently , the @entity35 can forecast weather conducive to tornadoes about seven or eight days out , @entity34 said			1
this is a vast improvement over 15 years ago , when forecasts were available for just one day ahead			0
in the case of the tornado that hit @entity10 , forecasters predicted severe weather in the @entity3 area as early as wednesday			1
but these forecasts are for weather systems that are capable of producing tornadoes , not predictions of where a specific tornado may hit			2
advances in technology and science are continuously improving forecasts			0
" as computers have gotten more powerful , the models have gotten better , " said @entity104 , a professor of atmospheric science at @entity106 in @entity107			0
computers use the laws of physics and mathematics to make predictions based on simulations of the atmosphere that are represented on a grid			0
opinion : how can we be safe from tornadoes ? just like pixels on the digital cameras have become smaller and smaller , the grid that these computers use has gotten smaller , allowing for more precise forecasts , @entity104 said			0
but tornadoes are so small , relatively , that they are still too small for the models to see			0
the increased power of these computers have made it easier to spot storms systems that could spawn tornadoes			0
new research may increase the window of prediction from the current seven or eight days to 10 to 12 days before the event , @entity104 said			0
@entity36 is also working with several institutions to increase warning lead times for tornadoes and other severe weather			0
known as " warn - on - forecasts , " the new methodology would issue warnings based on forecasts rather than observations , said @entity146 , a professor of atmospheric science at @entity148 in @entity149			0
the new method is promising , he said , but it is still at an experimental stage			0
it might allow forecasters to provide cones of uncertainty for a tornado , similar to those used to predict where hurricanes are headed			1
these warnings for tornadoes could come one to six hours before the tornado , as opposed to the current 15 - to 30 - minute warnings , @entity146 said			1
another innovation with the new research could result in forecasters providing the strength of a tornado at the time it is formed , instead of after the fact , as is currently the case			1
residents may react differently if they know the intensity of the tornado heading toward them			1
the challenge , @entity146 said , is the same one that all forecasters face : a forecast depends on the data available			0
deadliest @entity181 tornadoes on record			0

residents of @entity10 had time to prepare for tornado , but can more be done ?
forecasters can predict tornado - worthy storms up to eight days in advance
new technology could yield more warning , " cones of uncertainty " like with hurricanes
