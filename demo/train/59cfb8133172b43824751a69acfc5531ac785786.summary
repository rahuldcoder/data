-- a reporter last week asked me if many people cared about the release of individual records from the @entity6			1
" are they just a historic relic ? " was the followup from someone else unimpressed that the general public would finally have access to more than 100 million census records locked away for 72 years			1
@entity14 answered those questions loud and clear			1
the @entity17 website housing 1940 @entity6 records registered over 60 million hits in just three hours on tuesday , april 3 , 2012 , the second day they were open			1
the outpouring of demand for such information calls on us to examine what is driving it			0
the individual records help @entity14 gain a greater sense of who our ancestors were and with it an understanding of the blood that runs through our own veins			2
each image from the 1940 @entity6 is a lined page called a population schedule , containing the records of up to 40 individuals			2
they might not look like much -- the penmanship of 123,000 census takers varied , the cursive may be hard to read , ink from fountain pens ran too light on some letters			0
one line on a 1940 @entity6 record , however , has the power to confirm a family legend we have heard for years , or it can make us confront a troubling truth buried long ago			1
the @entity17 ' innovative move of putting scans of these 3.9 million pages online has democratized genealogy			0
we might have expected that the first wave of retirees from the nation 's nearly 77 million baby boomers would pause to reflect on the world their parents inhabited			2
we might have expected the too - rapidly dwindling ranks of @entity65 veterans to look for a glimpse of home life in the months before 15 million of them entered the services			0
when the 1930 @entity6 records and those from earlier decades were released , searches largely were confined to people able to trek to @entity17 facilities and depository libraries to work through microfilms produced by the @entity78 in the 1930s and 40s			2
now the 1940 census records are available for free , and millions of people are accessing them			0
the fascination with the snapshot of the @entity14 provided by the 1940 @entity6 runs beyond any one individual 's search for her or his own past			1
the statistics available online now from the @entity78 can deepen people 's understanding of the towns and times their ancestors inhabited			0
@entity94 , @entity95 , had exploded in size with construction of the @entity98 its population stood at 8,422			0
around 9 million @entity14 households used ice boxes to preserve their food			1
family members finding their grandmother had completed four years of college by 1940 will learn that her accomplishment put her among the top 5 % of @entity14 residents in terms of education			1
genealogists have been looking forward to this release as they would a national holiday , as have thousands of historians , economists and demographers			1
the release of the 1940 @entity6 records will allow them to shed a light on a @entity14 very different from how we live now			1
community profiles of smaller population groups of the type so commonly released now by the @entity78 with data from the @entity127 were not published from the @entity6 during days of @entity65 when it is released , the @entity121 's database of digitized 1940 census records will allow researchers to build such profiles			1
they will be able to aggregate individual items into their own tables and run analyses			0
to get an idea of the diversity of nationalities in the @entity14 at the time , president @entity135 's @entity134 , urging @entity14 to participate , was translated into 23 languages , including @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150			1
because residents in 1940 answered census takers ' questions , the records released last week will provide a glimpse of @entity157 tribal lands on the eve of the uranium boom , which transformed the landscape			0
economists will be able to analyze how people in specific occupations or smaller geographic areas fared during the @entity165			1
the 1940 @entity6 gave the country in 1940 a snapshot , one moment frozen in time			2
that portrait attracts us because it was taken on the edge of momentous change -- a time when @entity14 began developing many of the tools we now take for granted			1
the @entity14 instituted its first peacetime draft in september 1940 ; and the ranks of the armed forces mushroomed			2
unemployment fell from around 15 % for the week before @entity183 1940 to around 4.7 % by 1942			0
citing unprecedented movements of the population to areas with heavy concentrations of armaments manufacturing and responding to the administration 's orders , the @entity78 unveiled a 1941 plan to conduct an annual sample census			0
when that plan faltered for lack of funding , more than 200 communities paid the @entity78 to conduct censuses within their jurisdictions between 1941 and 1946 alone			0
today those communities base much of their decision - making on data from the descendant of those plans , the @entity127			0
because @entity14 opened their doors to census takers in 1940 and the survey interviewers who followed them , the @entity14 had the information president @entity135 assured them was necessary " to guide us intelligently into the future			2
" the @entity78 thanked the millions of respondents in 1940 and the thousands of households responding to surveys each month since then ; we their heirs should thank them now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			0

@entity218 : 60 million hits in 3 hours after release shows *hunger* for family history
@entity224 : hidden for 72 years , it 's now available to all to verify family lore or learn a secret
@entity6 shows @entity14 during vast change , he says : coming war , receding @entity165
@entity224 : the release was like the first pitch on opening day for historians and economists
