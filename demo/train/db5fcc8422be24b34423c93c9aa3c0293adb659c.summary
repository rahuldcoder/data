-- @entity1 was still wearing the blood - stained watermelon pink suit when she got to the @entity3 in the early - morning hours after her husband was shot dead			1
she had refused to take it off at @entity6 in @entity7 or on the flight back to @entity9 with the body of her husband			1
once at the @entity3 , her personal maid put the suit in a bag so mrs. @entity1 would n't have to look at it			1
in the words of president @entity17 , she looked " smashing " in the suit , which may be why the president asked @entity20 to wear the now - famous outfit to @entity7 on november 22 , 1963			1
the suit looked like a @entity24 , it was actually a knockoff , made in the @entity26			1
the first lady wore it at least six times before that fateful day			0
she was known for her fashion sense			0
museums have hosted collections of her gowns , hats and jewelry			0
in @entity37 on the morning of november 22 , the president even joked about his wife 's style			0
" two years ago , i introduced myself in @entity40 by saying that i was the man who had accompanied mrs. @entity1 to @entity40			1
i am getting somewhat that same sensation as i travel around @entity43			0
nobody wonders what @entity45 ( @entity45 ) and i wear , " @entity1 quipped			1
hours later , @entity1 was trying to crawl out of the presidential limo , her suit spattered with her husband 's blood			1
when aides suggested she change her clothes , she refused			0
" her remark , i think she made it more than once is , ' no , i 'm going to leave these clothes on			0
i want them to see what they have done , ' " author @entity57 said			0
@entity17 assassination a collective memory for @entity26 children hours later , @entity1 continued to wear the suit during the emergency swearing in of @entity45 as president			1
" that whole scene is obviously just surreal , " @entity57 said			0
" she arrives in the cabin in @entity69 in these clothes , covered with the president 's blood , and she 's expected to stand there and witness the swearing in of her husband 's successor			0
" the suit today is in the @entity79 building in @entity80			2
it came in a box , along with a handwritten note from @entity1 's mother on her personal stationery			1
it read simply : " @entity20 's suit and bag - worn november 22nd , 1963			2
" the suit was never cleaned			2
the public has n't seen the suit since the assassination and wo n't for another 90 years			2
opinion : 50 years on , the enduring lessons of @entity17 's presidency in 2003 , nine years after her mother 's death , @entity95 gave the suit as a gift to the people of the @entity26 with the understanding that it would not be put on display until 2103			2
and even then , the @entity1 family will have to be consulted before any attempt is made to display it			1
they want to avoid sensationalizing the horrible act			0
also hidden from view in the new archives building in @entity80 : the blue blouse @entity1 wore beneath the pink suit , her stockings , blue shoes and blue purse			1
what they do n't have is the first lady 's iconic pink pillbox hat			1
" the hat is a mystery , " said @entity57 , who wrote " a @entity119 and @entity120			2
" " the hat apparently goes to the @entity124 initially and the @entity124 turns it over to mrs. @entity1 's private secretary , and then it disappears			1
it has not been seen since			0
" the archive has the suit stored in a windowless vault , in an acid free container , where the air is changed three times an hour to properly maintain the wool and cloth			2
it is kept at a temperature of 65 to 68 degrees , which is best for the fabric			0
boy who witnessed @entity17 assassination recalls the day			0

the suit was a knockoff of a @entity24 design
@entity1 had worn it on several *occasions* before @entity7
it will be stored *safely* until 2103 under @entity1 family orders
the *whereabouts* of the pink pillbox hat remain a mystery
