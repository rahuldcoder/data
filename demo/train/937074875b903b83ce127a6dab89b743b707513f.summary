-- it 's been more than 30 years since high - level officials from the @entity3 and @entity4 sat down together to talk face - to - face			1
secretary of state @entity7 and @entity4 foreign minister @entity8 met in @entity9 as part of a meeting between the @entity13 country and the five permanent members of the @entity15 plus @entity16			1
both diplomats described as " constructive " the meeting , which explored the idea of restarting talks on @entity4 's nuclear program			1
" we hope to be able to make progress towards resolving this issue in a timely fashion based on respecting the rights of the @entity4 people to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes , including enrichment			2
and , at the same time , making sure that there is no concern at the international level that @entity4 's nuclear program is anything but peaceful , " @entity8 told reporters after the meeting			1
@entity7 , likewise , sounded cautiously optimistic			2
" i think all of us were pleased that foreign minister @entity8 came and made a presentation to us , which was very different in tone and very different in the vision that he held out with respect to the possibilities of the future , " @entity7 said			1
" there 's a lot of work to be done , so we will engage in that work obviously and we hope very , very much -- all of us -- that we can get concrete results that will answer the outstanding questions regarding the program , " he added			1
@entity8 made a 15 - to 20 - minute presentation , a senior @entity54 official told @entity0 , laying out what @entity4 's interests were and his nation 's desire to reach agreement with other nations and fully implement that agreement within a year			1
the @entity54 official called @entity8 's presentation " thoughtful			1
" outside of the larger meeting , @entity7 and @entity8 also had a short bilateral discussion			1
" we stressed the need to continue these discussions to give it the political impetus that it requires , and hopefully to reach a conclusion in a reasonable time , " @entity8 said			2
" i 'm satisfied with this first step			2
now we have to see whether we can match our positive words with serious deeds so that we can move forward			0
" such a high - level meeting involving the @entity3 and @entity4 has n't happened since @entity4 's 1979 revolution , which sent relations between the two into a deep freeze			1
but the election of new @entity4 president @entity84 , widely seen as more moderate than his predecessor , seems to have opened the possibility of a thaw in relations			2
@entity84 made comments this week that have led many leaders to conclude there is a chance to strike a nuclear accord between @entity4 and the other nations			2
he called on thursday for an end to nuclear weapons , saying such disarmament " remains our highest priority			0
" " as long as nuclear weapons exist , the risk of their use , threat of use and proliferation persist , " @entity84 told the @entity100 on behalf of the @entity101			0
" the only absolute guarantee is their total elimination			0
" the recent developments prompted president @entity112 to dispatch @entity7 to seek a deal with @entity114			2
the @entity3 and other world powers have long said they believe @entity4 wants nuclear weapons			1
@entity4 has said it only wants to harness nuclear energy for peaceful purposes			2
@entity112 said on tuesday that curbing @entity4 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , along with solving the @entity13 conflict between @entity121 and the @entity122 , would be his highest foreign policy priority for the remainder of his term			1
" while these issues are not the cause of all the region 's problems , they have been a major source of instability for far too long , and resolving them can help serve as a foundation for a broader peace , " he said during his address on the opening day of the @entity100 in @entity9			0
@entity112 sounded cautious about any possible breakthrough , saying " the roadblocks may prove to be too great , but i firmly believe the diplomatic path must be tested			0
" senior administration officials said @entity112 made the decision to appoint @entity7 his point man on @entity4 to demonstrate an increased emphasis and importance the president is putting on improved relations with @entity114			1
until now , negotiations have been held at lower levels			0
but raising the dialogue through @entity7 was intended to reiterate @entity112 's openness to move forward with a bilateral approach on @entity4			1
upon taking office , @entity84 appointed foreign minister @entity8 , a western - educated former ambassador to the @entity156 , as his lead nuclear negotiator			1
the move was similarly seen as a gesture at improving relations with the @entity161			0
in his speech to the @entity100 , @entity84 said @entity4 was prepared for immediate nuclear talks that are " time - bound and result - oriented ... to build mutual confidence and removal of mutual uncertainties			1
" the @entity4 leader also said he listened carefully to @entity112 's speech and hoped the @entity3 " will refrain from following the shortsighted interests of warmongering pressure groups " so the two nations " can arrive at a framework to manage our differences			1
" in february , the bloc of countries leading the diplomatic effort offered @entity4 a package of economic incentives to abandon its nuclear ambitions			2
in exchange for easing of sanctions barring trade with @entity4 in gold and other precious metals , the group wants @entity4 to shut its underground enrichment facility at @entity189 , near the holy city of @entity191 , and ship out its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 % purity			2
the group also proposed fuel for a medical reactor and easing sanctions on aviation spare parts in exchange for @entity4 suspending its uranium enrichment and shipping its stockpiles out of the country			0
@entity4 has never formally responded to the deal and it remains to be seen whether the group would be willing to sweeten the offer in the new climate			0
@entity84 told @entity0 's @entity208 that he has the full backing of @entity4 's supreme leader , @entity210			1
" the supreme leader , i can tell you , has given permission for my government to freely negotiate on these issues , " he said in the interview			0
@entity112 administration officials have said they believe the @entity4 are ready to negotiate because of the toll international sanctions have taken on their economy			0
in his remarks thursday , @entity84 said @entity4 would be willing to live under @entity222 safeguards against nuclear weapons , but scolded @entity121 for not signing on to international nuclear nonprofileration agreements			0
" @entity121 , the only nonparty to the @entity226 in this region , should join thereto without any further delay			0
accordingly , all nuclear activities in the region should be subject to the @entity222 comprehensive safeguards , " he said			0
" the international community has to redouble its efforts in support of the establishment of this zone			0
this would constitute a contribution to the objective of nuclear disarmament			0
" @entity121 has never acknowledged having nuclear weapons but is widely believed to possess them			0
@entity121 officials fear @entity4 nuclear weapons pose a direct threat to their security , especially after years of bellicose rhetoric from the previous @entity4 president , @entity249			0
while @entity84 's tone has been different -- he recently wished @entity252 a happy @entity253 through his official @entity255 account and on wednesday acknowledged the reality of the @entity257 in western media interviews -- @entity121 prime minister @entity259 said earlier this week that he 's not yet sold on @entity4 's seemingly more moderate tone			1
@entity261 : can @entity84 or @entity112 deliver on any deal ?			0
