@entity0 -- which is scarier ? letting @entity3 go bankrupt ? or saving @entity3 from bankruptcy ? if you 're a @entity7 businessman or banker , the answer is obvious : bankruptcy is scarier			1
if @entity3 can not pay its debts , @entity3 will likely quit the euro			1
by quitting the euro , @entity3 would regain the power to print its own money and inflate its way out of its debt			1
now think what that would mean for your business			0
if @entity3 quit the euro , people would begin to worry : who 's next ? will @entity24 quit ? @entity25 ? @entity26 ? @entity27 ? do you own a 1000 euro deposit in a @entity25 bank ? tomorrow that account could be denominated in new pesetas , at who knows what exchange rate			1
likewise : better sell your @entity24 and @entity26 bonds -- not only government bonds , but bonds issued by any agency sponsored by government : water , electricity , transit authorities , and so on			0
a @entity3 default would trigger , in effect , a bank run on every governmental institution in southern @entity7 , the biggest bank run perhaps in the history of the world , bigger even than the run triggered by the failure of @entity53 in september 2008			1
as i said : scary			0
but now think like a politician			0
it 's been obvious for some time now what has to be done to avert the bank run : a @entity60 , a version of the @entity62 that was used to bail out @entity63 in 2008 the @entity64 will have to assume responsibility for the debt of southern @entity7 countries			1
in return , the @entity64 will have to take control of the finances of those countries -- cutting their spending and raising their taxes			2
the debt assumed by the @entity64 will have to be serviced somehow			0
that means the @entity64 will need its own revenue stream sufficient to pay for and ultimately retire the southern @entity7 debt			1
in other words , what we 're looking at is : -- a transfer of @entity3 and other southern @entity7 debt to all the people of @entity7			1
-- big government spending cuts especially in southern @entity7 , but also everywhere else			1
-- higher taxes everywhere to support the southern @entity7 debt			1
-- all of it imposed by unelected bureaucrats in @entity89			0
how 'd you like to be the politician who has to explain that to the voters of @entity94 ? so now you see why action is so slow			0
the trouble is , the longer the action takes , the more expensive it gets -- and the less likely the action is to be successful			0
if the action comes early and if it is decisive and orderly , then it may be possible to force creditors to eat some of their losses			0
but in a panic , governments will not have time or leeway to negotiate			0
they 'll face a starker alternative : pay in full or default , the same stark alternative the @entity108 faced back in the fall of 2008 , which led to unappealing actors such as @entity111 being made whole in backroom deals at the expense of the taxpaying public			1
and if markets get the idea that the politicians of northern @entity7 will flinch from the @entity60 , then the bank run could start very fast			2
last week , the @entity121 parliament voted 440 billion euros in bailout funds			2
( that 's almost $ 542 billion in @entity108 dollars			1
) bigger would have been better			2
the supreme need is to overwhelm the problem -- to show markets that the resources are at hand to pay all obligations -- and thus to gain credibility for tough negotiations so that lenders bear some of the costs of rescue			0
@entity108 had better hope that these negotiations succeed , because it 's very doubtful that the @entity108 can avoid being dragged into an emergency euro rescue			1
in 2008 , we worried about banks that were too big to fail			0
in 2011 , we have to worry about countries that are too big to be saved by @entity7 action alone			2
if the crisis comes , it will require funds from the @entity145 and very possibly the @entity146 too , like @entity147 in 1994 only much , much bigger			2
and remember how popular that was with the @entity149			0
better to anticipate -- and to prevent			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			2

@entity152 : if @entity3 defaults , all of @entity7 's debts would be *suspect*
he says the @entity108 could be forced to *participate* in rescuing @entity7 's finances
@entity7 's *leaders* need to take *unpopular* , *dramatic* steps to bail out the south , he says
the *sooner* and bigger the bailout , the better , @entity152 says
