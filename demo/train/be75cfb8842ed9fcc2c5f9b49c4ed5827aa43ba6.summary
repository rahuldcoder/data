-- in watching @entity3 's painful -- and self - destructive -- gaffe about the " 47 percenters , " it at first seemed inexplicable , as if the man was writing off half of the electorate			1
never mind that the self - declared " victims " he 's talking about include seniors ( who actually voted @entity8 in 2010 ) and veterans ( many of whom might be inclined to vote for the @entity8 )			2
or that they 're also people who work hard and pay their payroll taxes , and might be getting some tax benefits for their children			0
so what is it about @entity3 , who should know these things -- and probably does -- that makes him so gaffe - prone ? another way to ask the question : why does a smart man say such stupid things ? @entity24 : i 'm the 47 % but - you 're wrong @entity3 ! i have a theory about this			1
in spending a lot of time this year thinking about @entity3 -- and speaking with those who know him the best , politically and personally while reporting a @entity0 documentary -- this much appears to be true : @entity3 has a businessman 's approach to politics			1
which means : he sizes up a situation ( or an audience )			2
he figures out what he needs to do to cut the deal			0
then he does it , and expects it to work			0
@entity42 , @entity3 speaks to a group of conservative @entity8 fat cats , and tells them what he thinks they want to hear so they will cough up the dough			1
belief is almost beside the point			0
he was closing the deal			0
here 's something to know : while @entity3 was born into politics , he 's not a natural - born politician			1
his father may have been a three - term @entity57 governor , but he told his son to go into business first			1
and now @entity3 is a numbers guy who came to the ideological part of politics late			1
and it shows , especially when you are asking voters to trust what you believe to become president			0
some politicians are hatched out of strong loyalty to a cause or a party			0
@entity3 is a businessman who came to politics out of a strong sense of duty -- and belief in his own ability to repair what 's broken			1
getting elected is what you have to do so you can do what you 're good at : fixing things			0
( in an odd way , kind of like president @entity82 , who also believes getting elected is what you have to do so you can do what you 're good at : transforming things			0
) @entity3 has had much success painting the self - portrait as a mr. fix - it			1
while he could n't defeat @entity90 , he did become the governor of the liberal state of @entity93 in 2002 , running as a pro-choice moderate			0
opinion : how @entity3 really feels about @entity8 once in office , though , when confronted with the difficult issue of abortion -- and looking at a presidential bid in the ever more conservative @entity8 -- he flipped , explaining to me that it was a matter of conscience , tempered by the reality of political power			1
" i realized what sounded good in a campaign , when i actually became the governor and would be the person who would sign a piece of legislation which could take human life -- i simply could n't do that , " he told me			0
but there 's no doubt about it : @entity3 had to move to the right to try and get the nomination , so he did in the 2008 campaign			2
and he did it again in 2012			0
in trying to explain @entity3 's jujitsu , former adviser @entity119 told me that @entity3 's journey on social issues was the journey of a businessman who " mainly looked at governing as an economic proposition , all of a sudden confronting some social issues as a mature adult responsible for human life			2
and so he did evolve there			0
" fast - forward to the " severely conservative " candidate of the 2012 primaries			0
and to the latest fundraiser chat in which @entity3 says half of the @entity137 public believes it has been victimized , and the government needs to take care of them			2
@entity141 : @entity3 's ' 47 % all of which leads to this question : does @entity3 believe any of this stuff ? in the end , it 's hard to know			1
but i 'll subscribe to a theory advanced by @entity149 in the @entity150 today : that @entity3 is a " decent man who says stupid things because he is pretending to be something he is not -- some sort of cartoonish government - hater			1
" maybe that 's what @entity3 thought he needed to be to cut the deal			1
but the problem is , presidential politics is n't just business			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			2

@entity165 : @entity3 comment about the " 47 - percenters " inexplicable at first
she says @entity3 views the world from the point of view of a business *executive*
@entity3 was telling audience what he thought they wanted to hear , she says
@entity165 : @entity3 views electoral politics as " what he has to do to get into office and fix things "
