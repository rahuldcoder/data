-- @entity1 has attracted much of the spotlight this week , signing a new contract at @entity4 that reportedly makes him football 's best - paid player and netting a hat - trick against @entity8 in the @entity9			1
you just knew @entity11 , @entity1 's rival in @entity13 , would respond			1
@entity11 scored three goals himself to take him closer to @entity16 's all - time record in @entity18 's top club competition and @entity19 thumped @entity20 4 - 0 to earn maximum points at the @entity22			1
for all of its possession in the early stages , @entity19 failed to unlock the @entity20 defense until @entity11 won a free kick at the edge of the box			1
the @entity29 took the free kick and put the ball past a helpless @entity32 in the 21st minute to start the rout against the @entity35 champion			0
@entity11 doubled the advantage with another left - footed finish after good work from midfielder @entity39 in the 55th minute before completing his treble in the 75th			2
with 62 @entity9 goals , the four - time player of the year could match or exceed @entity16 's tally of 71 sometime this season			1
@entity20 's misery was complete when @entity47 saved @entity49 's late penalty			2
" it was important to start with a win , especially playing at home , " @entity11 told @entity51 's @entity50			1
" we know how difficult these @entity9 groups always are			2
in the second half we had the ball and controlled the match			0
" we found it tough to pressure them initially because they were moving the ball well out from the back			0
but i think in general it was a great performance			0
" @entity19 manager @entity67 will now fly back to his native @entity29 to be with his family following the death of his father			0
@entity19 and @entity71 are expected to advance from @entity72 , and @entity71 beat poor traveler @entity74 2 - 0 at the @entity75 with two goals in the final seven minutes			1
one was an own goal by defender @entity79			0
@entity71 was far from convincing , with the @entity81 champion looking the more threatening throughout			0
@entity82 stunned @entity82 has endured a slow start to its league campaign under prodigal son @entity85 but an away loss to @entity87 on saturday paled in comparison to wednesday 's 2 - 1 reverse -- at home -- to @entity91			1
@entity82 , the tournament winner two seasons ago and knocked out in the group stage last december , labored for most of the first half but took the lead on @entity98 's low shot to the far corner deep in the first half			2
instead of adding to its advantage , @entity82 remained uninspired -- barring @entity98 's shot that struck the crossbar -- and paid the price when @entity105 leveled in the 71st			2
@entity108 's near - post header 10 minutes later gave @entity91 the win			2
@entity82 had eased past @entity91 5 - 2 on aggregate in the @entity111 in the spring			1
" i 'm the manager , " @entity85 told @entity112			0
" i 'm responsible for everything , especially in the bad moments			0
" tomorrow i will not wake up with a smile on my face but i have to wake up again			0
" we have to get the points ... in the @entity9			0
we do n't want to play in the @entity111			0
" elsewhere in @entity119 , @entity120 did n't stumble at home , blanking outsider @entity122 3 - 0			0
not a good start for @entity125 last season 's runner - up to @entity128 , @entity125 endured a miserable evening in @entity129 , falling 2 - 1 to @entity131 's @entity130 in @entity132 goalkeeper @entity133 was shown a red card in first - half stoppage time for handling outside the box and manager @entity137 was earlier sent to the stands for berating the fourth official			1
@entity140 continued his fine form for @entity142 , meanwhile , scoring the second goal in the @entity145 ' 2 - 1 win at @entity146 after the @entity148 ' fluent passing game failed to click in the first half			1
in @entity151 , @entity150 beat @entity152 3 - 1 to maintain its impressive home record in @entity18 and @entity154 edged debutant @entity155 1 - 0 .			1

@entity11 moves closer to matching @entity16 's record in the @entity9
@entity11 , a day after @entity1 's hat - trick , scores three goals as @entity19 beat @entity20
@entity82 suffers a shock 2 - 1 defeat at home to @entity91 after taking the lead
last season 's finalist , @entity125 , loses 2 - 1 at @entity131 's @entity130
