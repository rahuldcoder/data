-- want to buy that bottle of @entity2 at an airport duty - free shop abroad before your return to the @entity6 ? maybe you 've never splurged , since you do n't want to place it into your checked baggage , as required for your connecting flight home			1
now there 's a way			0
the @entity13 's 3 - 1 - 1 rule has been relaxed just a little bit starting friday , for people coming to the @entity6 from abroad			1
travelers who buy alcohol or other liquids at those duty - free airport shops abroad can bring them into the @entity6 on an international flight and carry them onto a connecting flight			1
this slight relaxing of the @entity13 's 3 - 1 - 1 rule affects only some people returning home to the @entity6 from other countries			1
before january 31 , a traveler who purchased wine at the @entity31 airport duty - free shop before flying to @entity32 and on to @entity33 , @entity34 , faced a dilemma			2
once he cleared @entity37 in @entity32 , the @entity13 required him to pack any liquids into his checked luggage before clearing @entity13 security to fly to @entity34			2
now , the @entity13 will permit international travelers to carry liquids in excess of 100 ml in their carry - on baggage , " provided they were purchased in duty - free shops and placed in secure , tamper - evident bags ( @entity49 ) , " according to the @entity13 website			1
the liquids must be screened and cleared by @entity13 checkpoint security officers , utilizing the same bottled liquid scanner technology that is used to screen medically necessary liquids in quantities greater than 3.4 ounces , according to a @entity13 official			0
just do n't drink your duty - free booze on that flight to celebrate			2
that 's still not allowed			0
the safest bet is still to check your liquids			0
that 's because the agency still reserves the right to not clear your favorite drink or lotion			0
liquids in metallic , opaque or ceramic bottles or other containers that can not be scanned properly will not be allowed in carry - on luggage .			0

the @entity13 has eased up on the 3 - 1 - 1 rule , just a little
the change affects only liquids purchased at duty - free airport shops abroad
travelers *transferring* to a *domestic* flight can carry on their liquids
