-- surrounded by gang violence in her @entity4 neighborhood , @entity1 opened her home to area youth and started a community program called @entity8			1
since 2003 , @entity1 's nonprofit has taught valuable life skills and provided recreational activities to more than 1,500 young people			1
@entity0 recently asked @entity1 for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the @entity15 of 2011			1
@entity0 : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a @entity15 @entity19 ? @entity1 : i was just finishing up a meeting at @entity8			1
i can not explain the feeling when they told me about my selection			2
@entity25 hit me smack - dead in the head ! i was elated and felt so honored			2
i could n't help but feel humble , as i know there are so many others like me who are giving their lives to help others			2
thank you all so much ! @entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to @entity8 ? @entity1 : this honor validates that organizations such as ours are needed and appreciated			1
i hope being a @entity37 will give us the platform to further our mission of saving youth			0
our community is plagued by violence , hopelessness and negativity			0
@entity0 has replaced all that with hope			0
our organization 's staff , volunteers , youth and the community -- all of us here -- will share it , and it will make the world a better place for generations to come			0
@entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a @entity37 ? @entity1 : i want to buy this ( building ) that we 're in right now			1
we 're growing with so many kids			0
buying the building will help us serve thousands of young people			1
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity1 : what i want people to know is that the work that i and so many others do can literally be the difference between life and death for a generation that seems to have lost all hope			1
deciding eight years ago to open my life to others has enriched not only my life , but the lives of hundreds of young people			1
this proves to me that giving hope to others is the key to changing lives			0
for that i am grateful			0
i know i 'm only one person , but i believe in the power of one			0
i believe that i can do things and i can change people			2
and it 's been working			0
if i can make a change in a generation , then my community 's going to get better -- because they 're going to be the ones that take it over			0
