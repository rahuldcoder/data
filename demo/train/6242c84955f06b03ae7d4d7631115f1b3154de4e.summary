-- @entity3 's @entity2 search engine will not follow @entity4 out of @entity5			1
executives have made that clear			0
but will they take the high road or the low road in their quest to win a bigger piece of a @entity5 's fast - growing internet market ? on monday @entity4 stopped censoring its @entity5 search engine and moved the service to @entity14 , where the @entity15 is n't censored			2
before this week @entity4 had a 35 percent share of the @entity5 search engine market , a nontrivial number in a country of 400 million internet users			2
it 's unlikely that many of those 140 million @entity24 users will stick with the new service at @entity26 , because many of its results are now blocked by the @entity5 government 's own network - level censorship system , known as the " @entity32			1
" with the loyalty of millions of @entity5 @entity15 searchers up for grabs , @entity33 , the home - grown search engine with dominant market share in @entity5 , is expected to be the biggest winner			2
but @entity3 's chief research and strategy officer , @entity40 , confirmed in an interview with the state - controlled @entity44 last week that @entity2 , which now has less than 1 percent of @entity5 market share , " is committed to stay			1
" he chided @entity4 for its lack of experience in @entity5 compared with @entity3 's 20 - year presence , implying that one day it , too , will grow up to the world 's realities			1
but is @entity3 being ethically responsible ? the answer to that question is not simply about whether @entity2 stays in @entity5			1
it 's also a question of how @entity2 stays			2
will @entity3 manage its legal obligations to the @entity5 government in a way that helps legitimize and prolong current censorship practices , or in a way that helps reduce censorship over time -- or at the very least increases transparency and accountability to @entity5 citizens ? in january , the @entity5 media gave prominent play to comments by @entity3 's founder @entity67 and ceo @entity68			1
@entity68 called @entity4 's move to stop censoring in @entity5 an irrational business decision			2
" you 've got to decide , " said @entity67 , " do you want to obey the laws of the countries you 're in , or not ? " in a blog post , @entity68 attempted to clarify @entity3 's position			2
while @entity3 intends to stay engaged in the @entity5 market , he said it does try to push back quietly against efforts to restrict peaceful political expression			1
" we have conversations with governments to make our views known , " he wrote			0
" in every country in which we operate , including @entity5 , @entity3 requires proper legal authority before we remove any internet content ; and if we remove content , we give users notice			1
" needless to say , those words were not quoted in the @entity5 media			2
as it happens , the way @entity3 handles censorship in @entity5 has changed since it launched a @entity5 version of its search engine and rolled out a @entity5 - language blog - hosting service in 2005			1
@entity5 @entity15 companies -- including @entity33 -- routinely delete content in response to casual phone calls and instant chat messages made by authorities who do n't find it necessary to prove that their request has any legal basis			1
when @entity3 started in @entity5 , its approach to compliance could best be described as " when in @entity108 , do as the @entity109 do			1
" that year , their employees deleted a popular blog in response to a phone call made by a government official to @entity3 's @entity5 business partner			1
@entity3 employees did n't just block the blog , which had called for a boycott of a newspaper after its editor was fired ; they took it off the internet completely			2
it was no longer visible to anybody in the world			0
in february 2006 , executives from @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity3 and @entity4 were summoned to a congressional hearing in @entity128			2
@entity4 had announced its decision to enter @entity5 with a censored search engine , @entity24			1
@entity125 was under fire for selling technology to @entity5 that helped authorities censor the @entity15			0
@entity126 was in the doghouse for having helped authorities convict pro-democracy journalist @entity136 and three other activists by handing over the contents of their e-mail to @entity5 police			0
" your abhorrent activities in @entity5 are a disgrace , " thundered the late @entity144 @entity143 rep. @entity142			0
executives justified their companies ' behavior by saying they are bound to abide by the local laws where they do business			0
then why , human rights activists and legal experts asked , were they responding to requests made by @entity5 authorities using no pretense of legal process ? @entity3 began to change the way it handles censorship			1
it says it has stopped taking down content every time @entity5 authorities object			0
it claims to have instituted procedures stipulating that only legally binding requests made in writing would be honored			0
when carrying out requests to censor entries on @entity171 ( later renamed @entity172 ) , @entity3 's blogging and social networking platform , it would block pages from users on the @entity5 network , but leave them visible to people viewing the page from all other countries			1
tests i 've conducted have shown that @entity172 's @entity5 service censors substantially less than its domestic @entity5 competitors			0
@entity2 seems to censor a bit less than the @entity33 but a bit more than @entity24 did			1
the criteria the company uses for deciding what to censor and what not to censor , however , are not clear			0
we have to take it at its word that it 's only responding to censorship requests made through a legally binding procedure			0
but an effort is under way to hold @entity3 publicly accountable to its promises			0
in 2008 , @entity3 , along with @entity4 and @entity126 , joined the @entity200 ( @entity200 , at globalnetworkinitiative.org ) , a group that has established a code of conduct for free expression and privacy			0
the goal of the initiative , whose members include human rights groups , investors and academics ( including myself ) is to help companies do the right thing under difficult circumstances			0
figuring out the right thing to do can be particularly tough in countries like @entity5 , where people have so much to gain from greater access to global internet platforms and tools , and the government works hard to co-opt companies to serve their purposes as a member , @entity3 has signed on to a document that states : " the right to freedom of expression should not be restricted by governments , except in narrowly defined circumstances based on internationally recognized laws or standards			1
" while the initiative does not expect companies to make their local employees conduct civil disobedience or pull out of markets at the first sign of difficulty , the @entity200 does expect that companies will not comply with arbitrary requests and will seek to protect users from the kinds of surveillance that could lead to human rights violations			0
member companies have agreed to submit to an independent evaluation process to determine whether their claims match the reality			0
earlier this month , @entity5 minister of industry and information technology @entity250 told the international press that foreign @entity15 companies must obey @entity5 laws			0
now the question is : will @entity3 take him at his word ? will @entity2 comply only with those censorship requests that have a clear basis in @entity5 law and which are made through a legally binding , documented and accountable process ? will it challenge them ? will it do everything it can to avoid storing personally identifiable user data that can be shared with local authorities , and will it clearly inform its users about what information is kept about them and with whom it will be shared ? when we know the answers to those questions , we 'll know which road @entity2 has taken in @entity5			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity276			0

@entity278 says that with @entity24 out of @entity5 , @entity2 could get more *customers*
she says @entity3 and other firms in @entity5 have yielded to *extra-legal* censorship there
but @entity3 set stricter rules recently for how it will comply with censorship , she says
will @entity2 comply only with requests that have a clear basis in @entity5 law ? she asks
