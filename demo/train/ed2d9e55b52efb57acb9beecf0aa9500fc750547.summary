-- an image on the website of @entity6 , in the picturesque @entity2 town of @entity3 , shows 18 smiling women and one man flushed after an arduous dance workout			1
but that 's not the full picture , authorities say			2
prosecutors say 29 - year - old fitness instructor @entity14 was paid to have sex with customers in her @entity18 studio			1
she allegedly got help from her business partner @entity20 , a 57 - year - old insurance salesman and private investigator			1
@entity22 is accused of having sex with dozens of men and videotaping many of the encounters			1
strong 's lawyer , @entity27 , tells @entity0 that prosecutors have given him a list of 150 patrons and a computer hard drive with some videos , with erotic titles , that are part of the investigation			0
neither @entity22 -- whose studio is " now closed , " according to its website -- nor her attorney , @entity40 , returned calls from @entity0			1
the local district attorney declined to comment on the case			0
both of the accused pleaded not guilty this month to prostitution - related charges : 106 against @entity22 and 59 counts against @entity20			1
attorneys act to conceal names in @entity18 sex case according to @entity3 police , authorities were tipped off in september 2011 to illicit activity at the studio			1
a subsequent investigation , with help from @entity2 's @entity57 and the @entity58 , led to the execution of search warrants on february 14			2
police arrested @entity20 on july 10 , making the case public for the first time			1
that was followed by indictments against him and @entity22			2
and the whole case has fueled debate , in @entity3 and in the courts , about whether the alleged clients should be publicly shamed			1
today , the town -- a stone 's throw from the tourist haven and rocky shores of @entity74 where , among others , former president @entity75 has a seaside home -- is on edge , waiting for the other shoe to drop			0
police have been handing out summonses to those accused of soliciting a prostitute ; all who receive one would then have to appear in court to answer the misdemeanor charges			1
according to @entity27 , the @entity87 include lawyers , accountants and even a local tv personality			0
the @entity91 routinely detail who in their community has been charged , with what crime , on its website			2
but the names of those accused of paying to have sex with @entity22 have not been published -- at least not yet			1
in a notice posted online , the department said friday it is waiting to release names pending an appeal made to the state @entity104 of a lower court ruling denying a temporary restraining order to block the identities from getting out			0
@entity109 plan to hold off releasing further information until the high court weighs in on the case			0
until then , tensions are high in @entity3 about what might happen if some of its most prominent townsfolk are publicly shamed			2
@entity118 , who works at a bakery in the town of just over 5,000 residents , said customers are talking about the scandal , but in hushed tones			0
and local radio host @entity125 said about half his listeners support outing @entity22 's alleged clients , while half think it 's not worth the pain it might cause their children			1
despite public pressure not to , the @entity133 has signaled its intention to publish the names -- like they would anyone else charged with a crime -- once police release that information			2
the newspaper 's editor , @entity141 , wrote the decision to do so was n't easy , understanding " many in the community ... would prefer we not print the names at all			0
" but she said listing the names was the right thing to do , making it clear who authorities believe was and was not involved			0
" there are people in this community who have had their names dragged through the mud for months because people believe they are on the list , " @entity141 said			0
" we also believe that printing the names of those charged with engaging a prostitute is the fair thing to do ... to help set the record straight and put to rest the ugly rumors that continue to circulate throughout town			0
" @entity0 's @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0

@entity18 instructor @entity14 , 29 , faces 106 prostitution - related charges
