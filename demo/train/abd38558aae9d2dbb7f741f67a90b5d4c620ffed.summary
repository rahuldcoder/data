he calls measles ' benign			2
' if you vaccinate your child , he calls you a bad mother			2
and he says our children " have the right " to get infections			2
when dr. @entity11 speaks , jaws drop			1
he has given a medical face to the anti-vaccine movement -- eagerly stepping in front of tv cameras to beat up on vaccines and make light of the dangerous diseases they help prevent			1
during the recent upsurge of measles cases , he 's been a frequent presence			1
but this week , he 's suddenly gone silent			1
e-mails and phone calls went unanswered			2
and wednesday , when a @entity1 news team showed up at his practice , someone called the police			1
confronted in the parking lot , @entity11 turned his back to the camera			1
why the about - face ? it may have something to do with the investigation that the @entity36 has opened against him			0
parents following advice like those @entity11 gives are at the core of the @entity42 outbreak , which is infecting mostly unvaccinated children			1
and some doctors have advocated that medical licenses be revoked for recommendations like his			1
the board says it 's received two complaints and is investigating			1
but it would n't disclose the nature of the complaints			0
" can we talk about the investigation ? " @entity1 's @entity55 asked @entity11 wednesday			1
" i have no comment , " he responded			0
" are you changing your opinion about vaccinations ? " she asked			0
@entity11 trained at @entity61 , then did residencies in internal medicine and cardiology			1
he sells himself as a traditional cardiologist who turned away from his practice in disappointment			0
" for years i practiced like any other cardiologist using pharmaceuticals and dangerous procedures			0
i became disenchanted with conventional medicine , " he said in a promotional video			0
instead of antibiotics , he 's likely to prescribe sleep , good family relationships and an organic diet			1
his anti-vaccine stance stems from his views on putting chemicals in our bodies			0
" what i am opposed to is that we are injecting chemicals into our children , " @entity11 said , when he recently appeared on @entity1 's @entity82			1
" this is aluminum , mercury , sometimes aborted fetal proteins			0
there 's antibiotics in there			1
" some of that 's correct , the @entity93 has said in its list of vaccine ingredients			1
but it 's not worth worrying about			2
for example : a common aluminum compound found in many vaccines -- aluminum hydroxide -- is also the active ingredient in antacid tablets			2
and some of it 's wrong : trace amounts of a mercury compound used in adult vaccines , is now absent from almost all pediatric formulas , the @entity93 has said			1
and vaccines have proven very safe for decades			2
they save lives and preserve health , the @entity93 said			0
before a vaccine was introduced to prevent measles , the @entity42 had up to four million cased per year , the @entity93 says			0
thousands were left with serious impairment like deafness or permanent brain damage			0
up to 500 people died back then each year			0
@entity11 has delivered some shocking statements during the current measles outbreak , which he approves of			1
better to get the disease than the vaccine , he 's said			2
he called measles " benign			0
" the fact that some people die is unfortunate but par for the course			0
" bad things can happen to anybody			0
we can be in a car accident ; we can be in a toaster fire , " he said			0
" we should be getting measles , mumps , rubella , chicken pox , these are the rights of our children to get it , " he told the @entity133			0
it 's nature 's way of building resistance ; vaccines are unnatural , he has said			1
@entity11 would be willing to take the death of another parent 's child into account to uphold the right not to vaccinate his own			1
" i 'm not going to sacrifice the wellbeing of my child			0
my child is pure , " he said			0
" and i 'm not going to put my child at risk to save another child			0
" on his @entity155 channel , @entity11 makes light of measles with a video from a black - and - white tv show that apparently aired in 1959 before a vaccine was available			1
its message , delivered as quotes from the characters : " it 's not serious			2
" " it 's kid 's stuff			2
" " they are doing active harm , " said dr. @entity169 , a practicing internist , who has urged state medical boards to investigate and pull the licenses of physicians like @entity11			1
" as physicians we are supposed to do no harm			0
these doctors are creating harm			0
they are promoting the spread of infectious diseases , which we should have wiped out by now			0
" tell that to @entity11 's patients			1
outside his office , the parking lot was full wednesday			2
his office told @entity1 his schedule is packed with patients -- seeking the doctor 's medical advice .			1
