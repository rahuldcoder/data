@entity1 , @entity0 -- from the fingerprints and digital imaging stored on e-passports , to iris scanners set up at airport immigration , biometrics are a growing part of the traveller experience			2
biometrics are a growing part of the traveller experience			2
it is estimated $ 7.3 million will be spent on them by 2013			0
though some of the technology might seem like the stuff of science fiction fantasy ( or nightmare , if you take the view of many civil liberty campaigners ) , the economics are very real			1
according to a recent study by market research firm @entity28 , investment in biometrics will drive global spending in the field to $ 7.3 billion by 2013 , up from around $ 3 billion this year			1
the use of biometrics ( broadly defined as technologies that identify people via physiological characteristics ) has expanded rapidly in recent years			1
almost every major hub airport has either begun using the technology , is trialling it or else has plans to do so			1
biometric passports are fast becoming the norm with some countries like @entity43 storing fingerprint scans in chips on all new ones issued			1
in @entity48 , iris scanners have been introduced at a number of airports , including all five @entity51 to allow travellers to bypass normal border controls			2
meanwhile , the @entity55 @entity54 plans to extend a program to fingerprint all foreign nationals entering the country			0
they are trialling it at @entity62 's @entity61 and plan to roll it out to all international hubs by the end of the year			0
the concept of biometrics has existed for some time - the first commercial application of a fingerprint reader dates back to 1984			2
so why the sudden interest ? it has been due in part to security concerns prompted by terrorist atrocities like the september 11 attacks in @entity76 , and in part because of major advances in technology			1
" in the last couple of years the technology has leapt forward in terms of its reliability , its accuracy and its robustness , " says @entity80 , from @entity81 , a supplier of biometrics technology to the @entity48 market			1
certainly there is a dizzying amount of new technology being developed for the market			2
@entity93 - recognition scanners may eventually be superseded by retina scanners , which experts say provide a more accurate measure of identity			1
meanwhile , fingerprinting scanners , which critics have blamed for inaccuracies , are being refined to scan below the skin , meaning that anyone wearing fake latex fingerprints would be detected			0
other emerging technologies are palm and finger vein readers			0
already in use in the banking sector in @entity110 , these scanners are thought to be more accurate than fingerprinting since a person 's fingerprint alters in childhood whilst palm and finger vein patterns remain unchanged from the womb			0
the idea of having your identity tagged from birth brings many of us out in a cold sweat , and is the reason large swathes of the public remain vehemently opposed to the concept of biometrics			1
@entity128 , from the @entity129 , a civil liberties ngo based in @entity62 , says one of the biggest concerns about biometrics is the risk of identity theft			1
" the difference with biometrics and the reason it presents a substantial threat is that if your passport is stolen , the government can reissue you a new passport number and you can move on with your life , " he tells @entity2			2
" if your biometrics are stolen , short of hacking off your finger there 's no way for consumers or travellers to reacquire their identity			1
" @entity80 , from @entity81 , on the other hand , insists that much of the fear is borne out of a misunderstanding of the technology			2
fingerprint scanners , for example , which his firm specializes in do not store fingerprints on a central database where they could be snooped on by governments and other agencies			0
the fingerprints are stored in a cryptic format on a standard pc , which he insists could not be reconstituted to create the actual print			0
fears of @entity174 aside , the use of biometrics in air travel faces other more pressing logistical problems			0
creating a harmonized system that speeds up rather than impedes the immigration process remains the biggest challenge			0
there have already been major teething troubles			0
according to the @entity182 , the new iris - recognition scanners installed at @entity48 airports should get you through immigration in around 20 seconds			1
however , problems with their introduction , not least many more fliers than expected registering , have meant queues for the so - called " fast - track " scanners have often exceeded normal immigration			0
with so many different technologies being used to varying degrees by airport authorities around the world , getting everyone to adhere to a single global standard is another major obstacle			1
the @entity198 ( @entity198 ) , the @entity200 body that oversees air travel recognizes facial recognition as its primary biometric standard , with iris and fingerprints accepted as the two optional identifiers			1
@entity207 , a spokesman for the @entity208 ( @entity208 ) admits that implementing this global standard will not be easy			2
" what we need to do is try and get these elements talking to each other , and also to start thinking of it as a complete process , " he says			0
@entity80 believes this is easily achievable in the next few years and then , like it or loathe it , he says the age of biometrics will truly be upon us			0
" i think the day of the almost totally biometric airport is very nearly with us			0

biometric technology identifies people via physiological characteristics
it is fast becoming a reality in most major airports worldwide
civil liberties groups say biometrics *increase* the risk of identity theft
facial recognition is accepted by the @entity200 as the global biometric standard
