@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 was the fastest racer in the @entity5 as he won the @entity7 @entity6 to add fuel to his world title chances			1
flags and banners bearing his name waved under sunny skies at the circuit outside the @entity0 city of @entity1 -- and he did not disappoint the grandstands			1
@entity3 daringly dived up the inside of @entity18 on lap 24 to snatch the lead from his @entity21 teammate			1
" @entity18 was n't defending really and i almost caught him unaware , @entity3 later said of the maneuver			1
" there was n't a moment in the race when i did n't think i could get him			2
" the victory was @entity3 's 10th of the season and moved him 24 points clear of his fierce title rival with two races left to go			2
but even if @entity3 wins next week 's @entity34 @entity6 just ahead of @entity18 , there is still a chance the 2008 champion will be denied a second title			1
a new ruling for 2014 will see double points awarded at the last race in @entity41 -- which means a win is worth 50 points instead of 25			2
there were swirling suggestions in @entity1 that @entity21 are privately worried that a final twist of fate in this fierce title race lies ahead in the desert denouement			1
perhaps unsurprisingly though , @entity18 spoke favorably of the rule change			2
" for me it 's great to hear because there 's a definite shot at the championship , " he said			2
elsewhere , @entity55 -- the only driver other than the @entity21 duo to take the checkered flag this season -- finished third for @entity59 after another battling race in @entity1			1
" it was n't boring out there , " the @entity61 said			0
" we had good pace , we were strong			0
i 'm really happy with the third -- i think it was the best we could do today			0
but despite @entity55 's excitement just 18 cars -- instead of the full complement of 22 -- lined up here on the @entity0 grid			1
the @entity73 and @entity74 teams were forced to miss the race because of financial difficulties and have also dropped out of next week 's @entity34 @entity6			1
@entity73 racer @entity77 chose to attend the @entity7 @entity6 anyway but he told @entity2 , " i was out racing with these guys a couple of weeks ago in @entity79 and now i 'm not racing			1
" it 's disappointing and strange			0
" for others at the heart of @entity84 , the race weekend was also clouded with concern over the sport 's financial future			2
@entity88 , the sport 's commercial rights holder , took the unusual step of holding a media conference at the @entity93			0
" we have to decide the best way to sort this whole thing out , " said @entity88 , who had earlier hinted the grid could shrink to 14 cars next season because of the growing costs of running an @entity84 team			0
" frankly , i know what 's wrong but do n't know how to fix it			0
no one is prepared to do anything about it because they ca n't			0
" @entity88 was referring to the complex commercial agreement the teams have signed that binds them until 2020			0
the sport 's governing body , the @entity112 , issued a statement saying it was " in favor of any initiative that will help reduce costs in order to ensure the survival of the existing grid			0
" while there may be two races left to settle the 2014 world title and double points on offer come the finale , for the teams lower down the grid it may be a case of double or quits when it comes to their finances .			0
