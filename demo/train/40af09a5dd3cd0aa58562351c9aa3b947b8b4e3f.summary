-- @entity1 said wednesday it is heading to the @entity3 coast to test whether tar balls and oil found on shore after @entity7 are from the company 's 2010 @entity9 oil spill			1
state officials reported tar balls and a large oil mat along the @entity9 shore south of @entity15 , and the @entity16 reported finding three oiled birds in the area on monday			1
@entity1 spokesman @entity19 said the area is one where @entity1 teams were already helping with cleanup from the 2010 spill before @entity7 arrived			1
as soon as they 're given the all - clear , they will return to do more cleanup and test whether the new oil is from their spill or another source			2
at least 13,000 @entity3 homes damaged by @entity7 " there 's a lot of oil out there that may not be ours , " @entity19 said			2
one sample is already being tested and more are heading to the lab , according to the @entity39 of @entity3 , which is coordinating with other state agencies to test the contents			0
