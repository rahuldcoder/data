-- top @entity2 jockey @entity1 could not believe his luck after winning one of horse - racing 's biggest prizes in dramatic fashion in @entity8 on tuesday			1
the 32 - year - old was able to ride at the @entity10 only because @entity13 's usual mount @entity11 was serving a ban for careless riding , and he had never seen the famed @entity17 raceway before monday			1
flown in by the @entity2 - trained stayer 's owner @entity18 , @entity1 triumphed by the narrowest of margins after a photo - finish with @entity24 's @entity23 in the 151st running of the prestigious event			1
" i was a bit anxious after the line , " @entity1 told reporters after claiming the $ 6.4 million first prize for the @entity29			1
" a rider on a pony told me they thought i had won and then when i turned the corner back towards the stands , everyone was applauding me			2
" i was n't supposed to ride him and did n't know until yesterday			0
@entity11 must be devastated and i hope he recovers quickly and that he will win many more big races			0
" two years ago i had a fall before @entity40 weekend and i missed winning four @entity42 races so i know what it is like to watch in your armchair			0
unfortunately it 's part of a jockey 's life			0
" @entity1 rated the victory as the second finest of his distinguished career , after the winning on @entity52 at the 2005 @entity53 in @entity54 in front of his family			1
" of course i have heard of the @entity10 before , but the atmosphere and the passion here , it is really something special , " he said			1
@entity11 rode @entity13 to victory at the @entity64 warm - up as trainer @entity65 followed the example set by last year 's winner @entity67 , who could only manage fourth on tuesday behind @entity69 - bred @entity68			1
i thought i was beaten so it 's even better , " @entity65 said			0
" we knew he was a good stayer , but i thought the race was so difficult to win			0
" maybe thanks to @entity67 last year , it made us realize that it was possible to do it			2
we were just beaten in a @entity78 at @entity79 ( in may ) , then we decided that we should look at the @entity10			2
" i would like to have a thought for @entity11			0
he did a great job in preparation for the horse and he has been a gentleman			0
