@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few months ago , most @entity1 would have laughed at a question that now looms large in their minds : " will there be a second @entity7 ? " living for decades through missile launches , naval skirmishes and nuclear tests conducted by their troublesome neighbor @entity12 , @entity1 learned to brush things aside and move on with their daily lives			0
@entity15 became more like a bothersome brother than an enemy nation -- especially to a younger generation that had never seen battles fought at home			1
but that changed instantly on november 23 , after @entity12 's shelling of @entity23 killed four @entity1			1
grainy security camera footage showing people fleeing for their lives sent chills down people 's backs			2
it showed them that @entity12 remains an immense -- and nearby -- threat			2
the country was on high - alert as the @entity1 military pursued a live - fire drill monday near the same waters where the november attack took place			0
gearing up to evacuate or hide in bunkers , islanders hoped for the best , but worried the conflict could swiftly spiral out of control			1
they said that the drills needed to happen , but noted that the timing might lead to another attack			0
" of course , it 's better not to do them , " said @entity48 , 84 , as she headed toward what would be the last ferry out of the island before the drills			1
after the drills ended monday , residents anxiously waited to see what would happen at a time when @entity12 's next step was anyone 's guess			2
is war a possibility ? few people shrugged off the idea			0
the shelling of the @entity23 was a wake - up call for people here , who realized they do n't have the slightest clue of what to do if @entity12 were to attack the country			1
what used to be a widely ignored practice was viewed in a different light			0
average @entity0 citizens took cover in subway stations and descended downstairs in office buildings in a simulated air - raid on that day			0
" we actually do n't participate very well , because nothing happened between @entity12 and @entity1			0
but recently it has happened , so it 's very serious for us to think about these kinds of events , " said @entity84 - sub , a university student who ducked into the subway station			1
in the minds of the younger @entity1 like @entity84 , dramatic images of @entity92 leaders shaking hands in @entity15 are fresher than old tales of war - torn memories			1
but recent developments on the peninsula might have changed that .			0

the younger generation has not seen @entity15 as a *significant* threat
the shelling on @entity23 changes that
island residents worry that the conflict could swiftly spiral out of control
" it 's very serious for us to think about these kinds of events , " one student says
