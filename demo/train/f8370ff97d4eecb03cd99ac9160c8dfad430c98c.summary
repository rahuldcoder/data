-- it 's a demon buried deep within the @entity3 psyche -- a demon which refuses to be exorcized			0
a word which brings shivers down the spine and strikes a fear into the heart of the country 's football fans			0
in @entity11 , the ghosts of years past haunted @entity13 again -- the " @entity14 " returned			0
@entity15 , the " bogey team " as it is known in @entity13 , wrote another painful chapter into @entity13 ' @entity18 history on friday			1
a 1 - 0 victory secured @entity15 's place in the semifinals for a record fourth consecutive tournament			1
but unlike in 1982 and 1986 , when @entity15 defeated the @entity3 in the last four on both occasions , this was not a battle of epic proportions			1
there was not the drama , nor the controversy -- but the end result was the same			0
@entity33 ' 12th - minute goal gave @entity15 a lead it never looked like relinquishing against a @entity3 side which flattered to deceive			1
in fact , it was almost an apologetic exit from @entity40 ' players -- so disappointing after the team 's encouraging performances in the group stage			0
at a tournament where there have been so many surprises , perhaps it was reassuring that there remains one constant			0
@entity15 , whether it plays to its maximum or just within itself , seems to always get the result it craves			1
@entity53 's side will now face host nation @entity54 -- which beat @entity56 -- in @entity57 on tuesday , while @entity13 returns home pondering what might have been			1
the tears flowed for those draped in blue -- this was supposed to be the day where @entity13 finally gained revenge			0
some 32 years may have passed since the two countries met at the 1982 @entity18 , but the painful memories remain			1
at the time , @entity13 's @entity18 hopes were in the balance with the game at 1 - 1 when @entity71 ran on to meet @entity73 's pass			1
@entity71 was the overwhelming favorite to reach the ball first -- and he did so , but as he approached , @entity15 goalkeeper @entity76 laid the @entity3 out cold with a brutal attack			1
@entity71 , shorn of three teeth and suffering damaged vertebrae , left the field on a stretcher , his limp hand held by a shaken @entity73 -- who feared his teammate might have even died			0
@entity76 stood tall -- he was n't red - carded , nor was he even cautioned			2
instead , he saved two penalties in the shootout following a 3 - 3 draw as @entity15 reached the final , before losing to @entity89			1
it was an achievement which preserved his name in notoriety , even securing him top spot in a poll held by a @entity3 newspaper for the most hated @entity96 -- a poll he won ahead of @entity97			0
while the incident may not register on the @entity96 consciousness , it was repeated endlessly on televisions in the buildup to friday 's contest			0
a game with a grudge -- it 's hardly a new experience for @entity15 , which appears to encounter such fixtures on a regular basis			1
its experience at this level is undisputed -- but a failure to win the @entity18 in 24 years has not gone unnoticed			1
in 2002 , @entity114 's team was defeated in the final by @entity54 -- since then there have been three consecutive semifinal defeats			1
for so long @entity96 football has been admired , but with success comes expectation and , in terms of triumphs , " @entity15 " has failed to deliver			1
perhaps this is the year where @entity53 's side finally delivers			0
criticized after a 2 - 1 extra-time victory over @entity127 in the last 16 at @entity54 2014 , @entity15 began brightly against @entity13 and made light of the flu virus which had swept through its camp			1
just 12 minutes of the contest had elapsed when @entity33 held off @entity132 to head home @entity135 ' perfect delivery			2
given the number of spectacular strikes witnessed at this @entity18 , @entity137 ' effort was remarkable for its simplicity			2
@entity13 , temporarily dazed by conceding , began to assert itself with the impressive @entity141 beginning to cause @entity15 problems			2
the diminutive midfielder , so influential in the group stage as @entity13 breezed through with ease , came close to forging an equalizer with 11 minutes of the first half remaining			0
@entity148 found space on the left and his pass allowed @entity141 to curl the ball towards goal only for @entity154 to save and @entity155 to lash wildly at the rebound			0
@entity155 , who scored three times in his opening two games , then went close before the interval as @entity33 blocked the forward 's close - range header			1
in 10 previous ties where it had trailed at halftime of a @entity18 tie , @entity13 had lost on each and every occasion			2
but this @entity3 side has already overcome the odds			0
that it qualified for the tournament at all was somewhat of a surprise given its dreadful performance in the playoff tie			0
a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity175 in the first leg left @entity177 staring into the abyss -- a misery only averted by a miraculous 3 - 0 victory in the return leg four days later			1
but a comeback against @entity15 , a team renowned for its ruthlessness and ability to dominate its opponents is a far more difficult proposition			2
@entity177 ' decision to replace a defensive midfielder in @entity190 with striker @entity191 signaled his side 's intentions			0
his pace , in addition to the threat posed by @entity148 and @entity155 , appeared to trouble a @entity15 defense which was never managed to give impression of being wholly convincing			2
but whenever @entity13 did manage to get in behind its opponents , @entity154 provided a formidable presence , denying @entity201 from close range			0
as both teams began to suffer in the heat , the action moved from end to end , with @entity15 twice failing to put the result beyond doubt then , with the contest entering its final throes , @entity155 's effort -- from a position where he would be expected to score -- was palmed away by @entity154 in almost nonchalant fashion			2
as the final whistle blew , heads fell , tears followed and @entity3 players were left with an all too familiar feeling -- the " @entity14 " had struck again .			0

@entity15 books place in semifinal of @entity18
@entity33 scored the only goal of the game
@entity15 reaches fourth consecutive semifinal
next plays @entity54 , which beats @entity56 2 - 1 later friday
