-- how did @entity1 make it through several layers of security unquestioned and end up on the tarmac at @entity6 ? that 's what @entity8 , the @entity9 and the @entity10 are trying to figure out			1
around 5 a.m. on february 23 , @entity1 was simply trying to park at an off - site parking lot in time to catch a flight on @entity15 , she told @entity0			1
she did n't notice she was pulling into a @entity8 employee parking lot , where she said she was waved through two security checkpoints and allowed to park			1
wearing a sundress and carrying her suitcase , she got on a @entity8 employee shuttle without being asked for identification			1
none of the employees on board was wearing a uniform , she said , so she said she did n't realize it was for employees only			0
" when i got to the airport , i looked around and i realized this is not where i was supposed to be			0
it was the tarmac with a big airplane sitting there , " @entity1 said			0
@entity1 alerted the shuttle driver , but she was still allowed to get out of the bus onto the tarmac			2
a ramp agent used his badge to take her up the stairs into the airport passenger area			0
" here i was sitting in the middle of the @entity41 without having to go through security or do anything , " @entity1 said			0
the airport employee who let her into the secure area told her to go downstairs and go through security as she normally would , @entity1 said			0
inside the terminal someone finally stopped her and asked for her identification			2
that started the investigation into how she had made it so far without being checked			0
( in a police report on the incident , the ramp agent she followed into the concourse said he assumed she was an employee because of all the checkpoints she had to pass			2
) " airports are responsible for implementing security programs that restrict access to secure areas , " said @entity9 spokesman @entity56 in a statement			2
" @entity9 is conducting an investigation to determine how an individual without proper credentials accessed the secure area of @entity6 via an airline employee parking lot			1
" @entity8 is re-emphasizing the checking of employee identification at @entity8 employee parking lots , according to the airline			1
" we have taken aggressive action with our security vendors at the parking lot to emphasize that all security procedures , especially verification of credentials , are strictly adhered to , " said @entity8 spokesman @entity71 in a statement			1
the police report states that @entity1 " was transported back to her vehicle and allowed to move her car " from the parking lot , noting that the delay caused her to miss her 6:30 a.m. flight to @entity86 , @entity87 , then on to @entity88			1
@entity1 told @entity0 she was able to catch a later flight to @entity88 , from where she recently returned .			0
