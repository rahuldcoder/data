the number of @entity3 cases in @entity4 and @entity5 could rise to between 550,000 and 1.4 million by january if there are no " additional interventions or changes in community behavior , " the @entity0 said in a report tuesday			1
the estimate was derived from a new forecasting tool developed by the @entity0			1
the range of estimated cases -- from 550,000 to 1.4 million -- is wide because experts suspect the current count is highly under - reported			1
the official death toll from @entity3 in @entity19 has climbed to more than 2,800 in six months , with 5,800 cases confirmed as of monday , the @entity17 said			1
but the @entity0 estimates that if 70 % of people with @entity3 are properly cared for in medical facilities , the epidemic could decrease and eventually end			1
in a press conference tuesday , @entity0 director @entity24 cautioned that this model is based on older data from august			1
the numbers are not projections , but " scenarios			0
" the model does not take into account president @entity33 's announcement that the @entity34 is sending troops and extra medical equipment to the area			0
nor does it take into account the additional help from other countries promised			0
what the model does suggests , he said , is that the current surge of help can " break the back of the epidemic " and is " exactly what 's needed " to end it			2
he said he is now " confident the most dire predictions will not come to pass			0
" the cautionary tale this data does tell , he said is that there would be an " enormous cost " if help is delayed			0
@entity56 , a special assistant to the president and senior director of the @entity58 said the model tells responders how to " bend the curve " and that the epidemic can end with a large international response			0
" the momentum must at least be maintained to ensure we are way out ahead of this , " @entity56 said			0
and added that the international help will need to " stay on this as long as it takes			0
" a separate nine - month assessment published by @entity17 experts in @entity72 on tuesday says the fatality rate of this outbreak in @entity19 is 71 % and that the " current epidemiologic outlook is bleak			1
" it also warns that without " drastic improvements " in measures to control its spread , the number of cases and deaths from @entity3 is expected to continue climbing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months			1
the cumulative number of cases could exceed 20,000 by november 2 , the assessment said			2
it blamed the spread not on a particularly virulent strain of the virus , rather it said this outbreak was so deadly because of a " combination of dysfunctional health systems , international indifference , high population mobility , local customs , densely populated capitals , and lack of trust in authorities after years of armed conflict			0
" " perhaps most important , @entity3 has reached the point where it could establish itself as an endemic infection because of a highly inadequate and late global response			2
" it warns that the global response must improve to meet the threat posed by this and future epidemics			0
another six - month report from @entity17 -- which assesses the situation in three countries at the outbreak 's center , @entity115 , @entity4 and @entity5 -- is dedicated to those health workers " who , as an expression of our innately shared human compassion , risked their lives , and lost them			1
" in the six months since this outbreak was first formally reported in march , 337 health care workers have been infected , of whom more than 181 have died , the @entity17 said			1
complete coverage of the @entity3 outbreak guinea : porous borders aid spread the @entity17 's six - month report on @entity115 , where the outbreak began in a remote area , details how the virus first gained a grip on a vulnerable , frightened population ill - equipped to deal with the deadly disease			1
once @entity3 was identified as the killer , a national and international response swung into gear			2
but each time it looked like the country might be at the point of controlling the virus , new flare - ups occurred			2
the @entity17 report concludes @entity3 kept getting reintroduced " into @entity115 -- with its notoriously porous borders -- from the large outbreaks in neighboring @entity4 and @entity5			1
" controlling the virus then will not be feasible in @entity115 until its stopped in neighboring countries			0
meanwhile , health workers there have come under attack as they seek to educate the local population			0
" today , one of the biggest barriers to control is violence from an impoverished , terrified and shattered population that does not understand what hit it and fights back the only way it can , " the report said			0
@entity4 : misery and hope @entity17 's six - month report on @entity4 summarizes their situation as one of " misery and despair tempered by some good reasons for hope			1
" the number of @entity4 cases is increasing exponentially , with 113 new ones reported over a single 24 - hour period on one day last week , @entity17 said -- a record number in any outbreak			1
at the same time , treatment centers are overflowing			0
many patients are turned away			0
the capacity to deliver other basic health services , such as care for women in childbirth , has been compromised			0
the report warns malaria - related deaths may soon surpass those from @entity3			1
@entity186 can be found in the opening of a new @entity17 - funded , 120 - bed ebola treatment center , it said			1
the @entity34 government is also setting up a new laboratory to speed up diagnosis			0
currently there are four major @entity3 treatment units in @entity4			1
in remarks made on tuesday , @entity4 president @entity194 said that her country 's health care system is hurting			2
of the over 1500 who have died , 85 were health care workers			0
the president characterized the @entity0 's model for possible infections as " scary to all of us			2
" she added , though , that she is happy with the @entity34 response to the disaster			0
she believes it will make a " major " difference			0
she predicts with that increased international effort , @entity4 will see better results in a couple of weeks			2
@entity5 : urgent needs the situation assessment for @entity5 explains how traditional burial practices helped the virus spread quickly there following the funeral of a respected local healer			2
the virus has taken a devastating toll on health workers and researchers			2
" @entity5 's most urgent needs include more treatment beds in much safer facilities , better contact training and follow - up , more personal protective equipment and body bags , and more properly protected teams to collect bodies and bury them safely , " who said			1
the deployment of international medical teams in @entity19 , including from @entity232 and @entity233 , may help			0
@entity234 and @entity235 , where the situation is judged " stable -- for the moment , " are seen as success stories			1
those countries have shown conventional methods such as early detection , contact tracing , isolation and an adequate supply of personal protective equipment can contain the virus , @entity17 said			1
" if @entity234 can control an outbreak caused by such a deadly and highly contagious virus , right from the start , any country in the world can do the same , " its report said .			2
