-- @entity1 thumped @entity2 and then downed @entity3 at home this month in the @entity5 so not many expected relegation threatened @entity7 to put up a fight at the @entity9 on saturday			1
but the @entity7 , rejuvenated under @entity10 , did just that and it took @entity14 's goal midway in the second half to finally put the visitors away			2
city won 1 - 0 to improve to a perfect 10 - 0 - 0 in the league at home this season and , without its closest rivals playing until sunday , overtook @entity2 by two points atop the division			1
defending champion @entity24 also struggled -- though not as much as @entity17 -- as it played without the injured @entity26 but edged @entity17 1 - 0 to collect a sixth successive victory in all competitions			1
city manager @entity29 made six changes to the side that doubled @entity3 2 - 1 on @entity32 , naming the likes of @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 to the substitutes ' bench			1
even though @entity17 bossed possession -- at 77 percent -- @entity7 matched the host in shots on target			1
and it was the first time @entity17 had n't scored at least twice at home in the top flight this term			2
" we did n't have a fresh team , " @entity29 told @entity47			0
" and it 's very difficult when you have one team that wants to play and the other wants to defend			0
" that was the game we saw today			0
that 's not what we 're used to doing at the @entity9			0
" although @entity29 essentially said that @entity7 parked the bus , recently reinstated @entity17 goalkeeper @entity58 made a string of good saves -- after sustaining a cut under his eye in a collision with @entity64 -- before and after @entity14 broke through in the 66th minute			1
@entity66 winner @entity26 , in fine form , missed @entity24 's trip to @entity17 due to a lingering groin strain but @entity24 said he should be available for wednesday 's clash against @entity72			1
@entity24 manager @entity73 did n't start @entity66 , either -- he has enjoyed recent success -- but the striker came off the bench to net the winner in the 57th minute			0
the @entity78 , who rallied to beat @entity80 3 - 2 on the road thursday , remained seven points behind @entity1 but climbed to sixth			2
" to win back - to - back games in the @entity5 in three days away from home is really difficult , " @entity73 told @entity47			2
" some teams do n't play until tomorrow			0
" we had two games in three days , and i have to say the squad coped really well			0
" i was delighted to get the result			0
i thought @entity17 played really well			0
" elsewhere , @entity91 conceded deep in injury time and had to settle for a 2 - 2 draw against last - place @entity94 ; @entity80 rebounded from the loss to @entity24 , routing poor traveler @entity97 6 - 0 ; and @entity98 and @entity99 produced six goals in a 3 - 3 draw in @entity102			1
@entity103 snapped a four - match losing streak although did n't beat @entity105 at home , drawing 1 - 1			1
@entity91 looked set to claim all three points in its first game since manager @entity109 was fired , taking a 2 - 0 lead			2
but @entity111 pulled a goal back for @entity94 in the 83rd minute and @entity113 equalized on a deflected effort in the fifth minute of added time			0
@entity2 travels to surging @entity116 on sunday and @entity117 hosts @entity3 in a battle of third versus fourth .			1

@entity1 needs 66 minutes to open the scoring against @entity7
but @entity17 wins 1 - 0 to extend its home record in the @entity5 to 10 - 0 - 0
@entity24 makes it six victories in a row by *blanking* @entity17 1 - 0
@entity2 visits @entity116 and @entity117 hosts @entity3 on sunday
