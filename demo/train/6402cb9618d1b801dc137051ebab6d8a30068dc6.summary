-- @entity1 has spent decades studying and admiring the nation 's fourth president , @entity2			1
her new book , " @entity2 : a @entity13 " is a labor of political admiration that began five years ago and culminated in a historical journey in which @entity8 , the father of the @entity10 , also becomes a prophet of productive conservatism			1
she considers his impact generally under - appreciated but incredibly profound			2
@entity16 hopes her book will complete the record on @entity8 's important role in the @entity20 â € ” as well as on his personal demeanor and political vision			1
" we talked about his being reserved and reticent			2
and his friends thought that it was going to damage his political career , but it did n't			2
and they came shining through , his amazing intellect , his political skill , that when you combine with modesty , he became an evermore admirable figure , " she told @entity0			1
her personal journey in a wide - ranging interview , @entity16 also spoke about her own personal political journey â € ” as a second lady , historian and mother â € ” and the impact of the public feud last year between her daughters over the issue of same - sex marriage			1
the family , she now says , is a " happy family			1
" she considers @entity8 the prophet of small government			2
he pushed for a strong central government early in his political career when he served in the early @entity54 , but he started having some doubts			2
" @entity8 began to worry about too strong a government , " @entity16 told @entity0			1
he founded the nation 's first political party			2
" that political party led to an era of partisanship in the 1790 's that 's the equal of anything we have today , " she said			2
when asked if that partisanship was worse or better today than when the government first began , she recounted how mean the politics of the 18th and early 19th centuries were			1
" @entity70 was revealed as an adulterer in the pages of the newspaper			2
@entity74 ( @entity2 's wife ) was attacked			1
... so , it was every bit as vicious , i think , as today is			2
and @entity8 was really responsible for it by starting this @entity79			2
" does she think this politics of personal destruction is a terrible thing ? " @entity8 would n't have thought so			1
" when asked about her views , she responded , " i do n't think so either			0
... its what happens when you have free and open debate			0
" controversial politics @entity16 is no stranger to controversial politics			1
her husband , @entity16 , was a @entity54 @entity20 backbencher before becoming a member of the majority leadership and vice president			1
he became a chief defender of the @entity96 and the controversial terrorism interrogation policies on terror detainees used by the @entity100 administration in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks			0
" i 'd like to take some of the edge off it , trust me			0
you know , i 've been through this , " she said			0
the most recent trial by fire occurred when her family had to confront fallout from her daughter @entity112 's bid for a @entity115 seat from @entity116			1
after @entity112 reiterated her opposition to same - sex marriage , her sister , @entity117 , who is gay and married , lashed out			0
" @entity112 , this is n't just an issue on which we disagree			0
you 're just wrong - and on the wrong side of history , " @entity117 wrote on @entity124			0
@entity16 and @entity1 felt the need to issue a statement to try to calm the tensions			1
how does a parent deal with all of that ? " my underlying philosophy is that you should try to keep family matters within the family			1
and i think it was , you know , unfortunate that happened , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" it 's hard to have two wonderful daughters who see things differently			0
... the disadvantage is that it becomes a public dispute			0
and i just do n't wan na do anything to continue that trend			0
it 's not good for family generally to do that , and i do n't think it 's good for ours			1
" she said the advice she would give other families who are going through these types of issues is to " just love your kids			0
... i love them unconditionally			0
i ca n't think of a greater gift that any parent can give a child			0
" about her position on same - sex marriage , she said , " i think @entity16 actually had the classic formulation			0
he said , ' freedom means freedom for everyone			0
' i think that 's a principle we can all agree on , " she said			0
' a happy family ' when asked if there had been a reconciliation between her daughters she responded , " we 're a happy family			1
" @entity16 and @entity1 now spend a majority of their time in @entity116 , not in @entity177			1
but they both are still very much into politics -- of all centuries			1
" @entity8 was the man who said we 're a government of laws , not men			0
( president @entity186 ) @entity185 seems to be showing us that we can be a government of man and not laws			1
so it is ... how can you evaluate the two of them in the same breath ? i ca n't see it , " she said			0
while the former vice president has been very vocal in his opposition to some of @entity185 's policies , especially national security , former president @entity100 has vowed not to comment publicly on policy matters or his successor			2
asked why the former president has decided not to engage , mrs. @entity1 said " i have no idea			1
but he seems to be content and happy and i look forward to seeing him and mrs. @entity205 next week			0
" do the @entity206 and @entity207 keep in touch ? " well , i 'm going to be at the @entity209 -- talking about @entity2			1
" @entity210 and @entity211 as for some of those who may run for president in 2016 , she said former @entity215 gov. @entity210 would make a " great contribution " if he ran			1
" he has to sort that out			0
it is so hard to run for president that -- you know , you have to be sure in your own heart and that 's what you wan na do			2
and he 'll figure that out , " she said			0
she was more sure about @entity211			1
" i in fact do n't even understand what the debate is about - will she or wo n't she			0
" she added , " you know she was defeated in this 2008 election in the primary			0
and we did n't see that coming			0
so i 'm not sure i could , i could predict that one for you			0
" for their part @entity16 and @entity1 are getting ready to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary			1
asked if they miss being at the center of the political universe , she said , " that was a great time and a time that both of us enjoyed			2
but it 's , you know , it 's one stage of your life and you move on to another one			0
we 're in our @entity257 years now			0
" @entity258 is @entity0 's chief political analyst .			1
