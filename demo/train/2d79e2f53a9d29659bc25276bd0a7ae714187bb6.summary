@entity0 may be the dominant force in @entity0 's wine economy , but as the continent 's middle class emerges and disposable incomes increase , entrepreneurs in some unlikely destinations are making inroads in the fine wine industry			1
as the world 's eighth largest wine producer , @entity0 's wine trade contributed 26.2 billion rand ( $ 2.4 billion ) to the country 's economy with exports increasing by more than a quarter in 2013 , according to the @entity16			1
@entity17 , market manager at @entity18 , said that wine is becoming increasingly popular on the continent but the industry is still in its infancy outside @entity0			1
he added : " the process of production and sustainability of wine in @entity28 nations , other than @entity0 , still has a long way to go in order to be competitive in the global market			1
we are still to see another @entity28 country produce wine at the level and quality of @entity0			1
" by opening vineyards and chateaus across the continent , some of @entity0 's lesser known winemakers are hoping to challenge that assertion and @entity0 's 350 - year dominance of the region 's wine business			1
from fruity @entity47 to rich - berry @entity48 , @entity46 takes a look at the next generation of " @entity54 " wines from some of @entity0 's lesser - known producers			2
@entity55 ( @entity56 ) nestled in a plush @entity56 valley on the @entity59 , the @entity57 is one of the country 's most prominent vineyards , producing a range of fine wines			1
the @entity65 is the winery 's flagship tipple			2
a dry , oaked white wine blend of @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , the @entity65 has hints of fresh gooseberry and an acidic , lemony finish			0
@entity57 manager @entity75 said a combination of high - altitude vineyards , hot summers and cool nights make land - locked @entity56 an ideal location for wine growing			1
he added : " whilst great wines are being made from @entity56 vineyards , some of which have received awards in international competitions , there is still room for growth in both quality and quantity			2
" @entity75 said that @entity56 wines are gaining recognition on the international stage as tourists visit the country 's vineyards			1
" our wines have more in common with traditional @entity101 wines and yet , as is the way with our wonderful continent , the old world grape varieties have been altered by our conditions , resulting in a truly @entity56 wine			1
" visitors to the @entity108 can take away a case of @entity55 and @entity110 , a classic red @entity111 , for $ 25			0
@entity112 ( @entity113 ) a light and tropical blend with a summery aroma , the @entity112 is the @entity118 's flagship vintage			1
the wine is produced high up in @entity113 's @entity118 , thousands of meters above sea level , and is owned by the @entity121			1
@entity122 , a spokesman for the winery , said : @entity124 is " unique in the sense that it is thought impossible to grow vines in this region			0
more than that it is thought that it ca n't be a good quality wine			0
" with a growing consumer base and plans to expand around @entity0 , the @entity118 , which sits on the equator , is proving that good quality wine can be produced in extreme climates , according to @entity122			1
but she added that the winery does not have enough volume to export to @entity101 and @entity140 markets yet : " we are currently intensively expanding our vineyards to cover 250 hectares ... we have received requests to export here but we are still at our expansion phase			0
" a @entity145 retails in local supermarkets for about $ 6 and the brand 's red wine for $ 7			2
@entity150 wine ( @entity151 ) @entity152 's @entity150 produces three wines -- dry white , red and " natural sweet			1
" @entity157 , technical manager at @entity151 , said the red wine has a smooth , rounded taste and is best with " @entity160 , " a local delicacy of roasted spiced meat , while the " natural sweet " wine is the perfect complement for light salads or simply enjoyed as an aperitif			2
the @entity150 is home to a number of varieties including @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 , a local dry red			0
@entity157 added that the dry earth and sandy soil , combined with low humidity , is perfect for producing dry white and red wines in @entity150			0
she said : " we have two harvests seasons a year , in march and august / september			0
after harvest the farmers leave the plants to rest for only one month			0
" @entity183 ( @entity184 ) with a deep maroon color and sweet aroma similar to port , @entity185 is a @entity171 blend with a smooth flavor and a rich tangy aftertaste with hints of raspberry			0
@entity185 , made by @entity194 in @entity184 , is produced in the foothills of the @entity196 , a series of peaks that run through northwest @entity0			2
just 10 kilometers from the sea , the vineyards are located in the middle of @entity202 , a peninsula in the northeast of the country , which boasts a @entity206 climate with wine - growing conditions similar to parts of @entity209 and @entity210			2
and at $ 7 dollars a bottle , @entity211 competes on cost with many of its @entity101 counterparts			0
@entity216 ( @entity217 ) for something very different , but very traditional , @entity218 is an @entity28 honey wine , primarily consumed in @entity217			1
the white wine , which can be either sweet or dry depending on the amount of honey used , also includes @entity224 , which is a buckthorn shrub native to the @entity227 nation			0
@entity228 , an expert on @entity216 and @entity230 cuisine , said that there are very few , if any , wineries that produce @entity218 as the wine tends to be homemade or served in a " @entity218 , " a bar that specializes in the wine			2
@entity236 is one of the producers to have mastered the art of @entity239 over the years			0
he said : " unlike other wines my @entity216 - based wines are all ' happy drinks ' that have a delicate taste and are thirst quenching			0
it 's a great stimulating aperitif and complement to most dishes or desserts			0
" @entity236 added that sales of @entity216 wine are increasing internationally as social media and international wine competitions raise awareness of alternative @entity28 wines			1
he said : " it has also taken tremendous effort to bring these ethnic , but ancient wines to the 21st century recognition ... obviously , my goal is to keep producing these delicious @entity216 wines			0
" @entity216 costs between five to 15 @entity230 birr ( 26 cents to 78 cents ) locally .			0

@entity0 is continent 's biggest wine producer , but other countries also make wine
@entity151 , @entity217 , @entity56 all hoping to compete with @entity0
@entity113 's @entity118 has a unique climate for its vineyards
*non-south* @entity28 wines still have a way to go , says one expert
