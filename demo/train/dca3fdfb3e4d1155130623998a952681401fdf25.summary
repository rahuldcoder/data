for @entity7 , the arrival of spring guarantees a few things , even in times when headlines echo the threats of conflict : hard - core hikers out in droves , fresh produce in the markets and trees up and down the peninsula blossoming into great swaths of soft pinks and yellows			2

a full - sized replica of the 16th - century turtle ships used by the admiral are among the displays			0
cherry blossom fans commonly seek photo ops of train tracks beneath a canopy of pink flowers , and around @entity68 stream and promenade , which is lined with blossoming trees and canola flowers			1
the latter location was made famous in scenes from the @entity7 drama " romance , " and has become a hot spot for couples taking photos			0

more adventurous is beondaegi ( boiled silkworm larvae )			0
a reliable sit - down option at any local restaurant , dolsot bibimbap is a mixture of rice and vegetables topped with an egg and spicy sauce served in a hot stone bowl			0
it 's one of the most satisfying and popular meals around , and goes great with local makgeolli ( @entity7 rice wine )			0
for visitors , the @entity35 makes a memorable day trip			0
