@entity0 , @entity1 -- they 're at the top of the ocean 's food chain -- but it is still a mystery how the oil disaster is affecting the shark population in the @entity11			1
even if sharks never touch the oil slick , their sources of oxygen and food are at risk			1
and a reduced shark population could impact the entire @entity11 ecosystem , according to @entity21 , a researcher at the @entity22 , who has been studying sharks for a decade -- tagging them to determine their migratory patterns and other behaviors			1
today , his research focus has changed			2
" the oil spill opens up a whole new avenue for critical research , " says @entity21			1
as with most weekends , @entity21 leads a university research team packed into a boat with interns and high school students , to fish for sharks			1
they research the impact of the oil on sharks and other species of fish in the @entity11			1
because sharks eat nearly everything beneath them on the food chain , they provide a lot of information about the ecosystem			2
" if you see high levels of oil in a shark , you better believe it 's in the whole food chain , " says @entity21 's assistant , @entity52			1
in order to take biological samples from the sharks , first they must be caught			2
ten lines are baited in areas believed to be attractive to sharks			2
" @entity66 do n't chew their food they swallow it , " @entity21 says			1
the lines are equipped with special circle - shaped hooks to prevent the sharks from harming themselves when they swallow the bait			0
swallowing a circle hook , with an inward point does not hurt the shark , @entity21 says			1
the shark swallows the bait and , as it starts to swim away , the hook turns and catches the animal 's jaw			0
he compares it to a lip piercing			0
" it heals very , very quickly , " he says			0
once a shark is on the line , it is pulled up to the side of the boat			0
larger sharks are kept in the water			0
the researchers lean over the side of the boat and gather tissue and blood samples , before attaching a tag to the fin			0
the process usually takes just a few minutes from the time it is reeled in until the shark 's release			0
the information has been used for creating protected marine areas , as well as medical research			0
large sharks that migrate long distances -- bull , hammerhead , and tiger sharks -- are outfitted with satellite tracking devices with sensors			1
when the shark breaks the water 's surface , its location is sent to a satellite			0
@entity21 then receives an e-mail containing the coordinates			2
the data on the sharks ' movement -- published on the @entity22 's website -- will tell researchers whether the sharks encounter the oil in the @entity11			1
@entity21 thinks the odds are high that sharks will swim through water filled with oil , but he ca n't be certain because there 's no precedent			1
he 's hopeful the sharks can outsmart the environmental disaster			2
" there is a possibility that these animals might be able to anticipate the oil and sense the oil and actually move away from it , " he said			0
swimming through the oil could be deadly for sharks			2
" @entity66 breathe through the water , " says @entity21			2
" they take in the water , the water goes over their gills and they extract oxygen out of the water			0
" if the water is mixed with oil , it would hinder their normal breathing pattern , he says			0
it 's still too early in @entity21 's research to determine whether sharks are swimming through the oil			1
" @entity154 " the hammerhead shark had transmitted a signal nearly every day for three months , until just a couple of days after the rig explosion that caused the oil spill			1
" the tag could have failed or it could have headed off somewhere else into deep water and just not come up in the last few months , " @entity21 says			1
" but that 's very unlike the shark 's characteristics			0
" either way , as long as there are fish in the oiled area , @entity21 and his team will be looking at the effects on sharks			1
" you know , there 's fishing areas closed in the @entity11 because they do n't want people catching and eating that fish , " he said			0
" but i do n't know if the sharks got the memo			0

researcher @entity21 has been tracking sharks for 10 years
now , his research is focusing on the impact of the oil spill
@entity21 and his team catch sharks , then tag them with transmitters
it 's still *unclear* if the sharks are *avoiding* the oil spill
