@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 said monday that it has become clear new strategies are needed to deal with how police respond to " active shooter " situations -- those in which someone with a gun is still on the scene and firing at victims			1
shootings like last month 's at the @entity14 have tripled in recent years , @entity2 told the @entity15 , and there have been 12 already this year			1
and he said such shootings have become more deadly -- a 150 % increase in the number of people killed over the past four years			2
" although research methods and results vary , it 's become clear that new strategies -- and aggressive national response protocols -- must be employed to stop shooters in their tracks , " @entity2 told the police chiefs			1
in the @entity14 shooting , the police response time was considered extremely fast			1
@entity32 chief @entity31 said her officers were on the scene in seven minutes , which is about half the national average response time			1
but still , 12 people were killed			2
experts say that despite a quick response time , the first officers on the scene often must wait until more highly trained special weapons and tactics teams arrive , and in the interim lives could be lost			1
@entity2 said that years of analysis reinforces the need for " an immediate , aggressive response to active shooters			0
in order to prevent additional casualties , it is often patrol officers -- not necessarily @entity53 teams -- who serve as the tip of the spear in responding to these incidents			2
" security consultant @entity57 describes current tactics as , " respond once your backup arrives , and use a contact - cover approach so you are not on a suicide mission			0
" @entity2 said that police do n't always have the luxury to take the time to get their best - trained , best - equipped officers to the scene			1
" to save lives , the first officers to arrive must sometimes be the ones to directly engage an active shooter , " @entity2 said			1
" that 's why all law enforcement officers must have the best equipment and most up - to - date training to confront these situations			0
we owe these officers nothing less			0
" @entity57 focuses on training regular people how to protect themselves before police arrive at the scene			0
he says people who work in places where a shooting could happen could use some training , too			0
" get up and move -- do not become a victim , do n't be a stationary target , " he said			0
" react by escaping the target			0
" @entity2 said the @entity89 has partnered with groups like the @entity91 to train more than 50,000 front - line officers , more than 7,000 on - scene commanders and more than 3,000 local , state and federal agency heads on how to respond to active shooter situations			1
and it has joined with other federal agencies , local partners and outside experts to develop guidance for schools , churches , colleges , universities and private citizens on how to prepare for such incidents			0
@entity2 also said that the @entity89 has placed an increased emphasis on evaluating threats with the goal of disrupting potential shootings and other violent attacks			0
the @entity114 's @entity113 has successfully disrupted hundreds of potential shootings -- including 150 this year -- @entity2 said			0
while @entity2 pointed to partnerships with the @entity118 in active shooter response and prevention , there is disagreement on other issues : @entity118 president @entity123 , retired chief of police in @entity125 , @entity126 , said in his introduction of @entity2 that the group 's membership " profoundly disagrees " with the @entity89 's decision not to challenge laws legalizing marijuana in @entity133 and @entity134 and not taking a stand against legalizing marijuana in @entity126 , as that state 's @entity137 would do			1
" this decision by the @entity143 @entity89 , in our view , will open the floodgates for those who want to legalize marijuana throughout the country , those who have the resources to place initiatives and referendums on state ballots and those who 've continued to profit from the sale of this unlawful drug , " @entity123 said to applause			2
@entity2 said the @entity89 and law enforcement agencies need " marriage counseling " in dealing with some issues .			2

@entity2 says tactics for approaching " active shooter " situations should change
police agencies do n't have the luxury of waiting for @entity53 teams to arrive
@entity32 police response time in the @entity14 shooting was great , but still 12 people were killed
police chiefs disagree with the @entity89 's position on states that legalize marijuana
