this was no ordinary second - round match for @entity3 at the @entity4 , even though her opponent was ranked outside the top 200			1
@entity3 faced @entity6 , whose slide in the tennis world the previous two years could largely be attributed to injury and illness			1
the crafty @entity6 is a former world no. 2 -- and took on @entity3 on a much grander stage , the @entity13 final , in 2010			1
@entity6 was still a heavy underdog thursday and playing without pressure , built up three set points on the @entity3 serve at 5 - 3 in the first set			1
trouble for the world @entity18			0
but just as @entity20 and @entity21 stepped up when their backs were against the wall wednesday , so did @entity3			1
she erased all three of the set points to hold			1
it was the start of a 10 - game run that propelled the 18 - time grand slam winner to a 7 - 5 6 - 0 win on the first day of sweltering conditions -- temperatures reached almost 36 degrees @entity32 in @entity33 -- at the year 's opening major			2
" things really clicked , " @entity3 told reporters			1
" i had no other option but for things to click			0
i just had to start playing better			0
" @entity3 dropped just eight points in the second set , an ominous sign for her third - round foe , @entity42			1
@entity3 ' older sister , @entity43 , also progressed to the third round by crushing fellow @entity46 @entity45 6 - 2 6 - 3			1
@entity3 said she continues to draw inspiration from @entity43 , who was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease , @entity49 , in 2011			1
" she 's like , ' yeah , if i win it 'll be great			2
if not , i 'm not going to worry about it , ' " @entity3 said			1
" i think that 's a great attitude because it takes a lot of pressure off of you			0
" she 's done so much in her career			0
she does n't have to win another match			0
the same thing for me			0
as long as we can kind of look at it that way , then we both will do really well			0
" another marquee second - round clash saw two - time @entity4 champion @entity67 tangle with @entity69 finalist @entity68			1
after a close first set , the rejuvenated -- and healthy -- @entity67 won 6 - 4 6 - 2 and celebrated by dancing on court			1
she 's on course to tangle with @entity3 in the quarterfinals			1
last year 's @entity13 champion , @entity73 , beat @entity75 's @entity74 6 - 2 6 - 4			1
@entity73 is one of the contenders at @entity77 this year , having triumphed in @entity78 last week			0
the 2013 @entity4 finalist , @entity79 , is flying under the radar thus far -- which she probably does n't mind			1
and after getting past the tricky @entity82 in the first round , @entity79 crushed unpredictable @entity85 @entity84 6 - 2 6 - 0			0
another lucky escape @entity20 saved match points in defeating qualifier @entity88 , but it 's an uncommon feat. saving match points two matches in a row is almost unheard , yet veteran @entity94 has done it			2
the @entity96 fended off three match points against @entity46 @entity98 , prior to saving one more thursday in the third set versus @entity101 @entity100			2
@entity94 , the 12th seed , eventually advanced when @entity100 retired with heat exhaustion while leading 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 3 ) 0 - 4			0
" i feel very lucky , " @entity94 told the @entity4 's website			1
" i think those two matches i won , i should n't ( have ) won , at least not the one today			0
" there was no such drama for top - seed @entity108			2
@entity108 needed less than an hour and a half to see off young @entity111 @entity110 -- who upset grand slam finalist @entity112 at @entity13 last year -- 6 - 0 6 - 1 6 - 4 , but defending champion @entity114 had to work somewhat harder against @entity117 qualifier @entity115			1
@entity114 prevailed 7 - 6 ( 4 ) 7 - 6 ( 4 ) 6 - 3			2
despite the loss , @entity115 can take heart from the fact he hit the fastest serve of the tournament at 242 kilometers per hour			0
in a week filled with mostly positive results for the @entity126 , favorite @entity122 -- in his record 19th straight tournament appearance -- blew a two - set lead to fellow 33 - year - old @entity128 of @entity75			0
@entity128 , previously 0 - 6 in fifth sets , came through 2 - 6 1 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 2			0
@entity69 finalist @entity130 admitted to feeling slightly dizzy due to the conditions but still eliminated another big server , @entity133 of @entity134			2
@entity133 failed to serve out the fourth set and @entity130 ran out a 4 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 2 7 - 6 ( 0 ) winner			1
" hot out there , " said @entity130			2
" a lot of sun. it was n't easy			0
especially third and fourth set i was a little bit dizzy and tired			0
but , you know , it 's going to be like this in @entity126 , so i think i was ready for it			0
hopefully i wo n't play ( in ) this condition again			0
" for @entity130 , the weather forecast looks promising			2
the forecast high for the next two days is 27 degrees @entity32 prior to the highs falling to the low 20s .			0
