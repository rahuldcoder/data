@entity0 -- defense secretary @entity2 , in what he said is his final address to the cadets at the @entity6 , warned friday against the @entity7 getting involved in another major land battle			1
he told the cadets that wars like @entity11 are not likely , and in fact he would advise against it			2
" in my opinion , any future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big @entity7 land army into @entity19 or into the @entity20 or @entity21 should ' have his head examined , ' as gen. @entity23 so delicately put it , " @entity2 said			1
@entity26 remarks contrasted with some in @entity7 who are pushing for the @entity7 military to take a more active role in other places like @entity31 , where huge groups of protesters are trying to overthrow the government of col. @entity35			1
the defense secretary told cadets they 'll be leading a force that has drastically changed how it fights			1
gates , who has previously announced he intends to retire this year , said it 's impossible to know what the next war , that these cadets will be part of , will look like			2
" when it comes to predicting the nature and location of our next military engagements , since @entity53 , our record has been perfect , " he said			1
" we have never once gotten it right , from the @entity55 to @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , the @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and more -- we had no idea a year before any of these missions that we would be so engaged			0
" but he said he is confident that future engagements involving the @entity66 will less likely include head - on clashes of large mechanized armies			2
" in the competition for tight defense dollars within and between the services , the @entity66 also must confront the reality that the most plausible , high - end scenarios for the @entity7 military are primarily naval and air engagements , " he said			1
he told the cadets at @entity6 that preparing themselves for a range of possible missions is a key to success			2
" the military will not be able to train or educate you to have all the right answers -- as you might find in a manual -- but you should look for those experiences and pursuits in your career that will help you at least ask the right questions , " he said			0
@entity2 encouraged the future @entity66 officers to look outside the armed forces for experiences that will make them better soldiers and leaders			1
" such opportunities might include further study at grad school , teaching at this or another - first rate university , spending time at a think tank , being a congressional fellow			0
" and he encouraged them to " become a master of other languages and cultures			0
" he said it 's not just the cadets who need to adjust to this new world , it 's the @entity66 itself			0
he said that the wars in @entity62 and @entity11 have created a group of highly - experienced , battle tested young officers who too often leave the @entity66 just when it needs their skills and knowledge the most			0
" men and women in the prime of their professional lives , who may have been responsible for the lives of scores or hundreds of troops , or millions of dollars in assistance , or engaging in reconciling warring tribes , they may find themselves in a cube all day re-formatting power point slides , preparing quarterly training briefs , or assigned an ever expanding array of clerical duties , " @entity2 said			2
" the consequences of this terrify me			0
" he said the @entity66 must adapt so that young officers with diverse experience and accomplishments are rewarded with promotions and that it must " re-think the way it deals with the outstanding young leaders in its lower and middle - ranks			0
" he wrapped up his speech on a personal note , telling the cadets said he feels responsible for each and every one of them " as if you were my own sons and daughters , " @entity2 said apparently on the verge of tears			1
" i bid you farewell and @entity152			0

future wars will likely be air and *sea* based , @entity2 says
the @entity7 has not been able to predict any of its recent military engagements , he says
@entity2 encourages @entity6 cadets to look outside the armed forces to round out experience
