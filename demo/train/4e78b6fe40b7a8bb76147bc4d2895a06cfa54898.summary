-- magnificent snow - peaked summits and quaint thousand - year - old villages provide the backdrop for an unforgettable adventure in @entity6			1
exploring the dramatic landscape on foot is nothing short of extraordinary , trekkers say			2
" [ one night ] the back doors were open towards the view of @entity13 and the other peaks of the @entity15			2
it was so beautiful with snow - capped mountains and the sky was full of stars			2
i think that was one of the most magical moments i 've ever had , " says @entity20 , who trekked to @entity13 base camp in april			2
planning a @entity6 expedition may seem daunting at first -- and you will be challenged -- but in the end , @entity27 worth it			1
you will come away with some of the greatest memories of your life , from savoring locally cooked meals at teahouses to soaking in breathtaking views of the high @entity15 , according to adventurers who 've made the trip			2
there are endless options when it comes to planning a trek in @entity6			1
one of the most popular routes is the @entity42 , which loops around the base of the @entity42 range			2
and , of course , the more difficult @entity13 base camp trek is a magnet for many visitors			2
worlds away in @entity49 experts urge travelers to be wary of individual porters and guides who approach you on the streets of @entity49			2
they are most likely uninsured , cautions @entity56 , general secretary of @entity57 ( @entity57 )			2
have a detailed discussion with your chosen trekking company to assess their professionalism , @entity56 advises			1
while booking in advance is a sure thing , some adventurous @entity62 say making arrangements in @entity49 is a convenient way to cut out the middleman			1
be careful not to overestimate your abilities			0
even if you feel completely comfortable with the people and the landscape and think you can make the trek on your own -- do n't			1
trekking with at least one companion is a must , especially if you 're a beginner , experienced trekkers say			1
since both the @entity42 base camp and @entity78 camp treks are located in conservation areas , you will need permits , said @entity81 , a @entity49 resident and an experienced @entity15 trekker who has been leading tours since 1995			0
you can get permits before you begin or upon entry into the parks			0
additionally , every trekker needs a @entity91 ( @entity90 ) pass			0
you or your trip organizer can get this card , which is part of a database that stores visitor information for safety reasons			0
when deciding on when to make your trek , there is generally one rule of thumb : avoid the monsoon season ( june through august )			1
the most popular times to trek are late spring ( march and april ) and early to mid-fall ( october and november ) , but keep in mind that is also when the trekking routes are busiest			1
to beat the rush , try going a week or two earlier or later , suggests @entity81			0
" there are such beautiful forests [ at the foothills of the @entity42 ] , and it 's @entity6 's primary rhododendron forest , so if you visit there in the last week of march , first week of april , the rhododendrons are full and it 's an absolutely staggeringly beautiful place			1
and the pink and red rhododendrons all up the hillside , a few magnolias mixed in , some jasmine , " @entity81 says			0
before heading to @entity6 , it 's important not only to prepare your itinerary , but also your body			1
even the mild or " @entity124 " parts of the " easier " @entity126 trek have their fair share of steep inclines			0
" walking around the golf course is n't enough -- you really need to do uphill walking			1
you can do that for a few weeks before you come , that will make it much easier , " @entity81 says			1
it 's cold in @entity6 -- really cold			1
weather - appropriate supplies are a must for any trekker , novice or expert			0
remember to pack your warmest down jacket and broken - in hiking boots as well as sun and eye protection			0
based on his experience trekking the @entity42 in 2009 , @entity144 , an avid hiker , recommends watching out for knock - off gear , like fake @entity148 jackets , which he saw in @entity49			1
you do n't want to climb up into the mountains only to realize your jacket contains synthetic down			0
if you 're planning on trekking up to higher altitudes , be cautious of altitude sickness			1
warning signs include vomiting and weakness of the body , says @entity20			0
@entity158 , a @entity49 resident who has been on several expeditions in @entity6 , suggests taking the trek gradually to acclimatize yourself -- overexertion in the beginning may lead to problems later on			1
make sure you have enough @entity6 currency before you get on the path			1
@entity144 recalls that there was " one @entity166 on the whole trek			0
" and even if there is an atm , there 's no guarantee that it has been recently stocked with money			0
there are two typical types of treks : the more popular teahouse trekking and a fully organized camping trip			2
a teahouse trek gives you the comfort of knowing that lodging and food will be provided			0
you can carry additional supplies -- clothing , snacks , sleeping bag -- on your own or hire a porter to carry it for you			0
once you finish walking , five to six hours on average per day , you settle down in a village			2
if you do n't have a guide to recommend a teahouse , talk to other travelers and consult guidebooks for suggestions			0
in teahouses that provide lodging and food , guests are expected to eat at least two meals : dinner at night and breakfast the next morning , @entity144 says			0
do n't expect a hotel experience -- expect better			2
@entity124 locals are known for being extremely kind and hospitable			0
@entity81 says you 'll be treated like family during your stay			0
@entity144 was looking for that kind of personal exchange			0
' " that 's why ] we picked @entity126 , it was the perfect balance of wilderness and viewing the high @entity15 while also getting the @entity124 culture , " @entity144 says			0
past visitors consistently praise trekking in @entity6 as one of the best experiences of their lives			1
@entity0 ireporter @entity214 , who trekked to the @entity216 in winter 2010 , says @entity6 was the most beautiful part of the world she 's ever been to			1
take advantage of the majestic mountains and the pristine landscape			0
unlike many other mountain ranges , the @entity15 area in @entity6 is practically untouched			1
" there 's no rubbish , there 's no gondolas going up to the highest view , there 's no cars , there 's no traffic -- it 's just complete serenity and it 's just the most incredible experience , " @entity224 said .			1

@entity62 agree that trekking in @entity6 is an incredible experience
