-- in @entity4 , as in most of @entity1 , football -- or soccer -- is a passion			1
but so dire is its economic and political situation that its best players , in fact the whole national team , defected in 2009 while at a tournament in @entity10			0
a leaked @entity14 diplomatic cable published by @entity15 uses " the beautiful game " to describe an ever uglier situation in this small but strategically important state in the @entity19			1
in a dispatch from december 2009 , then - ambassador @entity20 wrote : " many dusty streets in @entity23 are filled with urchins kicking an old sock stuffed with rags back and forth between goals made of piled stones			0
senior government and party officials are avid fans of the @entity32 and sometimes leave official functions early to catch key matches			1
" as for the missing national team , he writes : " only the coach and an escorting colonel reportedly returned to @entity4			2
( one wonders why , given their likely fate			0
) " the government denied any players had gone missing			0
@entity4 has only known one leader since winning independence from @entity45 in 1993 - @entity46			1
and the cables assert that his mercurial and dictatorial ways are largely to blame for the country 's parlous state			1
in its short life , @entity4 has been involved in a ruinous border war with @entity45 that cost thousands of lives , and is regularly accused by @entity56 governments and the @entity57 of supplying arms to @entity60 militants in @entity61 -- a charge raised by the ambassador with @entity4 officials			1
one cable quotes a leading businessman as saying @entity46 is mentally ill : " the worse things get , the more he tries to take direct control -- it does n't work			0
" another cable from earlier in 2009 says bluntly : " the country 's unhinged dictator remains cruel and defiant			1
" " the regime is facing mounting international pressure for years of malign behavior in the neighborhood			0
human rights abuses are commonplace and most young @entity4 , along with the professional class , dream of fleeing the country , even to squalid refugee camps in @entity45 or @entity83 , " according to another dispatch			1
according to the cables , the government 's stock answer was to blame @entity14 " and its puppet @entity45 " for all its troubles , with president @entity46 at one point claiming that the @entity90 was trying to lure @entity4 's youth abroad			1
there was apparently a brief initiative to improve relations soon after president @entity97 's election , with ambassador @entity20 describing an unusual picnic he attended at the invitation of a senior @entity4 official			1
" lunch was served in a rocky gulch beneath a thorny acacia tree			0
the ambassador and his wife were treated to grilled sheep innards served with honey and chili sauce ( but no silverware ) , washed down with a sour , semi-fermented traditional drink called , aptly , " sewa			0
" but @entity4 's alleged support for the @entity114 militia - an affiliate of @entity116 - did n't help matters			1
one cable quotes the ambassador as telling @entity4 officials : " @entity4 support for @entity61 extremists obviates closer ties and @entity4 will be held accountable for any @entity126 attack on the @entity14			1
" " how do you think we would react to a major @entity126 terrorist attack against the @entity14 ? " the ambassador asked			2
" this seems to have driven home the point to our @entity4 interlocutors			2
" another cable scoffs at the idea that mining gold will come to @entity4 's rescue , describing recently - discovered seams as like " @entity140 , with a thin layer of gold atop thicker layers of copper and zinc			1
" in a country whose exports were worth just $ 14 million in 2008 , even that might help			0
but the ambassador concludes : " in short , there is no help on the immediate horizon for @entity4 's faltering economy			2
" one leaked cable also described tensions within the military , with a conference of colonels deteriorating into a serious row			0
" the bone of contention ? perceived differences in the quality of the villas ( often confiscated from the original owners ) given to the colonels by the regime to maintain their allegiance , " the cable said			0
however , the cables suggest president @entity46 may be in power for some time to come			2
one from november 2009 concluded : " @entity46 is clever , very good at operational security , and two decades younger than @entity173 , " -- the @entity175 president who has been in power for thirty years			2
" while many in @entity4 long for change , few are in a position to effect it , " it said			0
as for the @entity4 people , the cables suggest that their long fight for independence has made them resilient			2
" @entity4 remain fiercely patriotic , " it said			0
" in the face of deprivation and oppression , the time - tested best practice is to shut up , hunker down , and pray for rain			0
