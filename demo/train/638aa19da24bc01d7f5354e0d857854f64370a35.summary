-- security forces under @entity4 rule have tortured @entity6 prisoners during the group 's five years of rule , a new report said wednesday			1
the @entity10 report also documents " serious abuses " in @entity6 's criminal justice system , such as arbitrary arrests , incommunicado detentions and unfair trials in the @entity17 territory of @entity6 since the @entity4 political movement took control in 2007			1
" after five years of @entity4 rule in @entity6 , its criminal justice system reeks of injustice , routinely violates detainees ' rights , and grants impunity to abusive security services , " @entity20 , deputy @entity21 director for @entity10 , said in an online posting wednesday			1
" @entity4 should stop the kinds of abuses that @entity32 , @entity33 , and others in the region have risked their lives to bring to an end			1
" read more : opinion : @entity4 at a crossroads in a bullet - point statement on its website , @entity4 ' @entity40 disputed the report 's accuracy and called it biased and political			1
titled " abusive system : @entity47 in @entity6 , " the 43 - page report said " there is ample evidence that @entity4 security services are torturing people in custody with impunity and denying prisoners their rights			2
" the group said @entity4 has executed at least three men " convicted on the basis of ' confessions ' apparently obtained under torture			1
" @entity10 says the rivalry between the @entity17 movements of @entity4 and of @entity66 , which prevails in the @entity67 , " remains a significant factor " behind many of the alleged @entity4 detainee abuses the group said the @entity66 - dominated @entity72 " arrests and detains @entity17 arbitrarily , including @entity4 members or sympathizers , and similarly subjects detainees to torture and abuse			1
" read more : can rival @entity17 factions reach unity deal ? @entity10 's findings are also consistent with increasing reports of abuse by security forces in @entity6 against detainees accused of nonpolitical crimes , including people accused of drug offenses and fraud			2
some of the cases documented have been " against people detained on suspicion of collaborating with @entity89 or the @entity72 in the @entity67			0
collaboration is a serious crime under @entity17 law , but suspicion of collaboration does not justify torture or other abuse			2
" @entity97 , for example , was charged with collaborating with @entity89 , the report said			0
his family and lawyer said he was tortured			0
but the group said military courts did n't " adequately address @entity102 's claims of torture			0
" last year , a firing squad executed @entity102			0
according to the report , " his mother said that @entity4 authorities had prohibited the family from burying him , and that police beat her when she tried to hold his body during the interment			2
" " there is ample evidence that @entity4 security services are torturing people in custody with impunity and denying prisoners their rights , " @entity20 said			2
" the @entity6 authorities should stop ignoring the abuse and ensure that the justice system respects @entity17 ' rights			0
" @entity126 , a spokesman for @entity4 ' @entity40 , said @entity4 gave @entity10 all of the information it requested , but was surprised that it was n't taken into consideration			1
and why , he asks , is the reporting about incidents from 2007 and 2008 now being released ? " it is obvious because it is a cover for the @entity134 occupation			0
also this report did not discuss the basic human needs of the @entity6 people by discussing the @entity89 siege on the @entity6 and did not indicate to any of the violations committed by the @entity89 @entity134 enemy to our @entity17 prisoners inside the @entity89 jails and prisons , " he said			0
