@entity8 plans to fly back to the @entity2 on thursday , family spokeswoman @entity7 said			1
there was no immediate response to the family 's announcement from the @entity3 government , which has not replied to previous requests for comment on @entity8 's case			1
@entity18 spokeswoman @entity17 said tuesday that after getting credit against his one - year sentence for time served and " for good behavior , " @entity8 was moved to a deportation facility for processing			1
" we understand processing will take a few days , at which point he will be returning to the @entity2 , " @entity17 said , adding that @entity2 diplomats have visited @entity27 regularly in custody and should do so again wednesday			0
@entity8 , 29 , of @entity32 , @entity33 , moved to @entity6 in 2006 after graduating from college to work for @entity35			0
his family says the 29 - year - old was arrested in april after uploading a 19 - minute video that pokes fun at a clique of @entity6 teens influenced by hip - hop culture			2
in december , he was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of about $ 2,700			2
the charges were not read in court , but the country 's main @entity48 - language newspaper reported that @entity8 was accused of defaming the @entity3 's image abroad			1
@entity3 officials would say only that @entity8 " was charged under the @entity3 's penal code " and was " entitled to the fair trial protections contained in the @entity3 's constitution			1
" in the 1990s , the label " @entity56 " was coined for a group of suburban teens who were known to talk tougher than they really were			0
@entity8 's video depicts a look at a " combat school " in the @entity6 district of @entity56 , where these " gangsters " are trained			2
the training includes how to throw sandals at targets , use clothing accessories as whips and how to call on the phone for backup			0
@entity8 's family said they were n't notified of the charges against him for five months			2
@entity2 gets 1 - year prison sentence for parody video " he tries to put on a brave face , " his brother , @entity76 , said in december			1
" he said that he was doing fine , not to worry about him , but i could just sense that he 's a little depressed			0
my impression is that he 's going just a little bit crazy in his cell			0
" @entity76 said his brother made the video " just for fun			0
" " he 's a big fan of ' snl , ' ' @entity86 , ' all those shows , and he and his friends just wanted to make a funny sketch comedy in their spare time , " @entity76 said			0
" there was no indication in local law that making a comedy video , making fun of teenagers in the suburbs , was a threat to the @entity3 's national security			1
" the online comedy community @entity86 , in fact , rallied to @entity8 's support , launching a # @entity104 campaign to correspond with @entity105 on december 10			0
@entity8 ended up serving nine months -- more than half of those before being charged -- before his recent move to a deportation facility , his family said in a statement			0
the family said it reached out to @entity2 secretary of state @entity114 before his @entity116 trip last week , with @entity2 sen. @entity117 also pushing for his release			0
" the disregard for freedom of expression , the arbitrary application of this cybercrime law , the constant delays revealed the @entity3 legal system as archaic and unfair by modern standards , " said @entity119 , the family 's @entity2 - based lawyer			1
" however , we are relieved that the @entity3 finally realized that @entity8 deserved to be released			2
" @entity130 : will @entity131 joins fight to free @entity2 @entity8 @entity0 's @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			1
