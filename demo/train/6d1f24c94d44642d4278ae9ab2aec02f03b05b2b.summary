-- september 23 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : @entity15 had a farm			2
and if you could text about that fast enough , you might have won 50 grand ! today , you 'll meet the teenager who did			1
welcome to @entity0 ! first up : @entity23 @entity24 : first up , leaders from around the world are coming together for a meeting in @entity4			1
it 's the @entity23 , and it gets together every year			1
the group is going to talk about world issues ; different leaders will make speeches			1
president @entity33 is scheduled to address the assembly today			1
so what ? why does it matter that a bunch of leaders are having a meeting ? well , the @entity23 is made up of 192 countries			1
and when we say they 're talking about world issues , we mean big subjects , like poverty and security , and specific things , like the war in @entity49 or @entity51 's nuclear program			1
they ca n't create new laws			2
but the decisions that they make and the policies that they come up with can have a big influence on what goes on in the world			2
health care provisions @entity24 : in the health care reform bill that you see president @entity33 signing over my shoulder here , that might 've been his biggest victory of his first two years in office			2
and parts of that law go into effect this week			2
for example , you can stay on your parents ' health insurance until you 're 26 , and insurance companies ca n't turn down children with medical conditions that exist at the time they apply for insurance			2
some people were and still are against this law , though			2
for one thing , it can cost a lot of money			2
plus , critics do n't like the idea that people have to get health insurance			2
that part of the bill goes into effect in a few years			2
what 's the @entity95 ? @entity96 , @entity14 : what 's the word ? the sector of a country 's economy that is n't run by its government @entity103 that 's the word ! @entity105 @entity24 : running a business in the private sector means risks and rewards			1
you can set your own prices , but there 's no one to really fall back on if things do n't go so well			1
@entity115 looks at what 's in store for thousands of @entity5 who are about to lose their government jobs and make the shift into the private sector			1
( begin video ) @entity122 , @entity123 , havana : a tall order in communist @entity5 : finding jobs for half a million laid - off workers in the private sector			1
here in @entity130 , not everyone is celebrating this capitalist notion			2
like it or not , employees at this barbershop around the corner are being pushed off the state payroll and handed the shop			2
they 'll be able to set prices and keep earnings , but they 'll now have to pay taxes and rent , and there 's no longer the guarantee of a fixed income			1
@entity144 , @entity145 [ @entity146 ] : " i 've been working for the state for years now and i 'm not interested in going private , " says @entity147			1
" i want to keep working for the state			2
" @entity150 : @entity5 plans to shed ten percent of public sector jobs over the next six months and allow more private enterprise to absorb the unemployed			1
a dramatic attempt by president @entity154 to reshape the sputtering economy			2
he says the state simply ca n't afford a bloated and unproductive workforce			0
but do n't expect @entity159 - style big business			1
@entity5 's new entrepreneurs will be encouraged to start small operations , maybe driving taxis , laying bricks or perhaps repairing toys			1
now , to get an idea of what 's in store for them , we 're talking to some of the people already working in the country 's miniscule private sector			1
@entity174 was laid off during @entity5 's last major economic crisis in the ' 90s			1
he bought a government license and set up a cobbler 's shop in his driveway			1
he says @entity5 should see this as an opportunity			1
@entity183 , a taxi driver , says it depends on how much the state charges its new entrepreneurs in taxes and licensing fees			0
they all agree , the days of getting paid by the government , whether you work or lounge about , are over			0
still , the state controls about 90 percent of the economy			0
these modest proposals are n't likely to radically shift that balance , but they will give life to a new class of small businesses that could change the face of @entity5			1
( @entity201 ) @entity202 @entity203 , @entity14 : time for the shoutout ! which one of these is the flag of @entity6 ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a , @entity213 , c or @entity215 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity216 is @entity6 's flag ; its design was influenced by the @entity159 flag			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! 24 hours in the @entity6 mine @entity24 : the 33 men who are waiting to be rescued from a mine in @entity6 are experiencing things most people never will and most people hope they never will			1
