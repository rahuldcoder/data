more than a century before @entity0 wore a terrifying crow headpiece in new @entity3 film " @entity4 , " another hero of the @entity6 was carefully arranging his own remarkable disguise			1
sometimes he dressed as a preacher , at other times a tramp , and occasionally even a woman			0
but beneath the elaborate costumes was always @entity13 -- a 19th - century @entity14 slave who became a legendary deputy @entity16 marshal , capturing more than 3,000 criminals with his flamboyant detective skills , super strength and supreme horsemanship			1
' @entity21 in @entity22 ' : the story of @entity25 's black cowboys sound familiar ? as one historian argues , @entity26 could have been the real - life inspiration behind one of @entity16 's most beloved fictional characters -- the @entity4			1
" many of @entity13 ' personal attributes and techniques in catching desperadoes were similar to the @entity4 , " says @entity32 , author of " @entity33 , @entity34 : the life and legend of frontier marshal @entity13			1
" " he was bigger than the @entity4 -- he was a combination of the @entity4 , @entity43 and @entity44 , " @entity32 told @entity41			0
" but because he was a black man his story has been buried			0
he never got the recognition he deserved			0
" legendary @entity4 it 's a world apart from the fictional @entity4 , who remains one of most the iconic @entity6 heroes of the 20th century			2
first appearing on a @entity57 radio station in 1933 , the masked man on a white stallion who brought bad guys to justice was hugely successful , with the series running for over two decades			0
it spawned novels , comic books and an eight - year tv show starring the most iconic @entity4 of all -- actor @entity64			2
indeed , @entity3 's new film -- featuring @entity66 as the @entity4 and @entity0 as his trusty @entity68 sidekick @entity67 -- is just the latest in a long line of films depicting the legendary lawman			1
so what 's that got to do with @entity13 -- one of the country 's first @entity75 marshals , who was born almost 100 years before the @entity4 made his radio debut ? hi - @entity78 ! quite a lot , argues @entity32 , pointing to similarities such as their gray horses , penchant for disguises , use of @entity68 trackers , and unusual calling cards -- @entity26 gave folks a silver dollar to remember him by , while the @entity4 left silver bullets			1
as for the iconic black mask , the link is more symbolic			0
" blacks at that time wore an invisible mask in a world that largely ignored them -- so in that societal sense , @entity13 also wore a mask , " said @entity32 , a lecturer at @entity92 in @entity93			2
" when the @entity4 first started appearing in comic books he wore a black mask that covered his entire face			0
why would they do that ? there was deep physiological connection going on			0
" then there 's the @entity57 link			0
many of the thousands of criminals captured by @entity13 were sent to the @entity112 in @entity57 -- the same city where the @entity114 character was created by @entity115 and @entity116			1
" it 's not beyond belief that all those felons were talking about a black man who had these attributes and the stories got out , " said @entity32			0
" i have n't been able to prove conclusively that @entity13 was the inspiration for the @entity4 , but he was the closest person in real life who had these characteristics			1
" real life superhero in fact , if the newspaper clippings , federal documents , and handed - down stories are anything to go by , @entity13 was n't just a lawman -- he was a 6 foot 2 inch moustachioed muscleman who was so honorable he even arrested his own son			1
born a slave in @entity14 in 1838 , @entity13 headed to the @entity139 front line in the 1860s , working as a servant for his master in the @entity143			1
while there , he managed to escape to the @entity145 -- now the state of @entity146 -- living with @entity68 and learning their languages and tracking skills			2
so renowned were the father - of - 10 's shooting skills and horsemanship , that in 1875 he was appointed deputy @entity16 marshal			1
" he was a big guy for his time , " said @entity32			0
" if you got in a fight with @entity13 it was the worst decision you could make in your life -- it accounted to suicide			2
" he was also an excellent horseman -- the @entity161 taught him how to make himself appear smaller in the saddle , helping him with disguises			0
" such was the skilled rider 's love of horses , he even bred them on his farm			0
indeed , many of the first @entity16 jockeys were @entity75 slaves who had originally worked in their master 's stables			1
lost legacy ? in his 32 - year career , @entity13 became a @entity6 celebrity , with folk songs springing up about the marshal with almost mythical strength			1
he died in 1910 , at the impressive age of 71 , just as segregation laws were starting to take effect in his home state			0
last year , a 23 - foot ( 7 - meter ) bronze statue of @entity13 , in all his gun - slinging glory atop a horse , was unveiled in @entity186 , @entity14			1
" he 's one of @entity16 's most important heroes and it 's sad his story is n't known more than it is , " said @entity32			2
" but unfortunately , the majority of black history has been buried			0
" even today , nobody knows where @entity13 is buried -- i like to tell people he 's still in disguise			2

@entity3 releases latest @entity114 film , but who was the real - life inspiration ?
historian believes it could be @entity75 @entity16 deputy marshal , @entity13
the 19th - century @entity14 slave became legendary lawman in what is now @entity146
they have many similarities , such as a gray horse , silver calling cards and disguises
