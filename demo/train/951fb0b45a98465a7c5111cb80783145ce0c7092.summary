capt. @entity3 , as he 's known on the airfield , will begin live - fire training , which is combined with " environmental and judgment training			1
" the course will be split between @entity0 and @entity18 @entity17 in @entity19			2
if he passes the two months of pilot training , prince @entity3 will be one step closer to becoming combat ready and possibly returning to the front lines of @entity24 , where the majority of pilots and crews successfully completing the @entity29 training are deployed , said @entity31 lt. col. @entity30			1
his training space is a bit famous , too : the @entity0 base , which is in @entity1 's @entity35 about 110 miles east of @entity36 and just minutes north of the @entity38 border , is the winter home of the @entity41 's @entity40			1
it is also where much of the film " @entity44 " with @entity45 was filmed , said @entity41 capt. @entity46 , commanding officer			0
the helicopter exercises will require the group of 20 @entity4 airmen to use all the lessons they have learned in the past 14 months of their training , @entity30 said			1
if successful , the prince and his mates will be deemed " limited combat ready " and will have four to six months more of training in @entity57 before they are considered fully combat ready , depending on their squadron 's schedule , @entity30 said			2
prince @entity3 -- the younger son of @entity5 , the heir to the @entity4 throne , and the late princess @entity65 -- served on the front line in @entity24 as a forward air controller and saw combat			1

but as second in line for the throne , he is specifically barred from combat			0
according to the @entity76 in @entity77 , prince @entity3 intends to return to @entity24 next year after he completes his training			1
he has been told by flying instructors he has a " natural flair " for flying , the newspaper reported this summer			0
the @entity4 military , which has been training airmen at @entity0 for the past 20 years , chose the @entity84 for the attack helicopter training because the mountainous desert and fine dust resemble conditions that @entity7 and @entity4 sorties now experience overseas			1
" the environment here is certainly what you encounter in @entity24			2
you ca n't replicate that in @entity57 , " @entity30 said			0
the @entity96 has been held several times at the @entity0 base since 2006 , most recently from march to may this year , @entity30 said			2
the tactical exercises will test the fighting awareness of the prince and his 19 classmates			2
the @entity0 instruction will focus on aviation environmental training and crew judgment			0
the students will be tested on handling the aircraft in mountainous and desert conditions , including dust landings and desert landings by day and night			0
" we 'll have guys on the ground acting as civilians or the enemy , and they 'll have to use their judgment , " @entity30 said			0
in the second month of training , the two - man helicopter crews will use live fire on the @entity121 air force range complex at the @entity122 in southern @entity19			1
they will deploy the @entity125 's weapons system : missiles , rockets and cannon			1
" we 'll have friendly troops that will indicate a target , and they will have to engage it , " @entity30 said			0
" this is the first time they will fire armaments outside of simulators			0
" the aircraft will be heavy and will have to be flown sympathetically , " @entity30 added about the @entity4 @entity138 1 helicopter , which is a modified version of the @entity84 military 's @entity125			1
@entity46 said that prince @entity3 wo n't receive any special treatment on the base			1
" we will treat him as we do all our visiting @entity4 personnel , " he told reporters			2
added @entity30 about the prince : " he is treated exactly the same as any other student on the course , and he would n't want to be treated any differently			0
" upon completion of @entity96 , prince @entity3 will return to @entity4 as a fully trained @entity125 pilot and will then be assigned to one of the @entity125 squadrons within 16 @entity154 , where he will gain more experience flying the attack helicopter and participate in exercises in the @entity4 , the @entity4 military said			1
the @entity4 @entity125 force , which is operated by that country 's @entity160 , is based in @entity162 , @entity163 , in @entity57 , and has been active in @entity24 the past five years , officials said			1
the force also provided support recently in @entity165			0
