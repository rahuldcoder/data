-- @entity3 @entity2 leaders announced thursday they will not take action on a new farm bill until after the november elections -- a sign of sharp internal @entity2 divisions on a critical political issue for many members of @entity11			1
" we will deal with the farm bill after the election , " said speaker @entity12 , @entity13			1
" the current situation that we face is we 've got people who believe there 's not enough reform in the farm bill that came out of ( the @entity22 ) committee , ( and ) we 've got others who believe that there 's too much reform in the bill that came out of the committee			1
" @entity12 indicated @entity2 leaders do not believe they currently have the votes to pass either a short - term extension or a more comprehensive five - year measure			1
the current five - year law establishing various levels of federal support for farmers and ranchers -- now struggling with drought in many parts of the country -- expires september 30			1
a failure to pass a new law wo n't impact existing federal support in 2012 , though it would have a significant impact on agricultural markets in 2013 , according to @entity45 , a public policy deputy at the @entity46			1
while the @entity49 - run @entity48 passed a comprehensive $ 969 billion replacement bill in june through a rare bipartisan 64 - 35 vote , numerous conservatives in the @entity2 - controlled @entity3 have balked at the overall price tag and rising cost of food stamps included in the measure			2
several @entity56 in tight political races this year , however , have pushed hard for quick legislative action on a five - year plan			1
@entity61 rep. @entity60 , a freshman @entity3 @entity2 running for retiring @entity49 sen. @entity63 's seat , told @entity0 thursday he was " frustrated with the @entity2 leadership			0
" " we have to get a five - year , long - term bill passed			1
i 'm really disappointed , " he said			0
" agriculture is one of our bright shining spots in @entity70 right now , and we do n't need to put this cloud of uncertainty over it			2
" @entity60 argued that @entity2 leaders should have allowed a full @entity3 vote on the @entity76 measure			0
the committee 's bill has a number of similarities to the @entity48 plan			2
asked about the farm bill 's legislative prospects in the post-election lame duck session of @entity11 , @entity60 said , " i look back over history and this is more normal than not			1
... i 'm just doing everything i can do			0
" @entity89 rep. @entity88 , the top @entity90 on the @entity91 , told @entity0 there were " 10 different reasons " why the @entity3 has so far failed to act			0
" some people think the food stamps are too high			0
some people do n't like the sugar program			2
some people do n't like the dairy program			0
some people do n't like the farm bill at all , " he said			1
@entity88 said he believes farm bill advocates will ultimately " get a shot " after the election			2
" i think they 're taking a ( political ) risk , " he said in reference to the @entity3 republicans			0
" but they apparently do n't think it 's a problem			0
" @entity45 told @entity0 that " we can whine and complain all we want , but the bottom line is this segment of the game is over			0
we 've got to get our strategy together and move our chips onto the lame duck line			0
