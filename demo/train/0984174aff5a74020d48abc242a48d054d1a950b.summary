@entity7 was an avid water skier and spent the past few weeks swimming in several bodies of fresh water			1
she died last week from @entity10 , a brain - eating parasite that lives in warm , standing water			1
at @entity7 's funeral monday , her family wore matching t - shirts with the logo of her water - skiing club , @entity0 affiliate @entity17 said			1
relatives honored the young athlete by announcing the @entity20 at @entity21			0
" our precious daughter , @entity7 , loved life and part of her great joy was spending time playing in the water , " her family said in a statement			2
" her life was taken by a rare amoeba organism that grows in many different fresh water settings			1
we want you to know this tragic event is very , very rare , and this is not something to become fearful about			0
" ' it just causes destruction ' while naegleria fowleri infections are rare , they can have devastating effects			0
" the amoeba ... finds itself way back in our noses and then can work its way into our central nervous system , around our brains , " said dr. @entity39 of @entity40			1
" and once it 's there , it just causes destruction			0
" symptoms usually show up five days after infection , the @entity5 @entity49 and @entity50 said			0
in addition to a severe headache , fever , nausea and vomiting , @entity58 fowleri infections often cause death			0
