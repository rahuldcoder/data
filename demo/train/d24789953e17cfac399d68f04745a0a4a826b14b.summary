-- occasionally , at odd hours , you may find that you have a @entity2 all to yourself			1
this allows for silent contemplation			2
there is one notation on the ubiquitous restaurants ' familiar laminated , double - sided menus that has long intrigued me			1
this summer i finally decided to look into why that notation is there , and the answer led , in a roundabout way , to an unexpected and beguiling tale of @entity16 business , and of fathers and sons			2
you really do learn something new every day			2
the omelets on all those @entity2 menus are not described as mere omelets			1
they are designated as " @entity25 omelets			1
" the @entity26 -- they have been out of business for decades -- were a cherished institution in the middle of the 20th century			2
i must have eaten hundreds of @entity25 meals as a boy and young man			1
they were open 24 hours a day , and were bare - bones			1
a counter and 10 stools			0
a place you could depend on			0
i never quite understood how those original @entity26 could make any money with only 10 customers at a time , but they were heartland perfection ( if not perfect for one 's heart )			2
cheeseburgers , grilled cheese sandwiches , hash browns made on the grill right in front of you , breakfast round the clock , and the most mouthwatering chocolate icebox pie and banana cream pie imaginable			0
i can taste those pies right now , and it 's been more than 40 years			2
the chain was based in @entity60 , and , as mid-south historian @entity61 has written , " everything was gleaming steel or white tile , and crammed into the tiny space were fryers and ovens and broilers and toasters and -- well , just about everything needed to prepare anything from a cup of coffee to a steak dinner			0
" i thought the @entity26 had vanished from everywhere but my dreams -- yet they live on , on every @entity2 menu			1
and , because there are more than 1,600 @entity80 in the @entity16 , there are a whole lot of @entity2 menus			1
to find out the reason for all of this , i got in touch with @entity2 headquarters , in @entity87 , @entity88			1
i was told that there is no financial connection between @entity2 and the old @entity25			1
but one of @entity2 's co-founders , @entity91 , got his start as a @entity25 employee , and it was he who insisted on the @entity25 label on the omelets , as a fond and wistful homage to those lost little diners			1
here 's where the saga gets cool			2
i delved into @entity25 history			1
it turns out that the guy who built the @entity26 from nothing into a mid-century middle - @entity16 treasure was a fellow named @entity106			2
he had owned a bus company , had sold it , and had devoted his business acumen to the @entity26			2
he died in the 1940s , leaving a 4 - year - old son fatherless			1
the boy , also named @entity106 , went to college , joined the @entity113 , served two tours of duty in @entity116 , then came home and , like his dad had done , decided to start a company			0
it was based on an idea he had dreamed up while in school			0
it had nothing to do with the restaurant business			0
it was a little firm called @entity128			0
how 's that for a father - and - son success story ? @entity25 and @entity128 , sharing a common bloodline			1
it 's one thing for a dad to teach his son the ropes in a family business , and hand it to him			1
and history is full of dads and their sons who have succeeded in the same field			0
@entity141 and @entity142 , and @entity143 and @entity144 , became presidents of the @entity16			0
@entity146 and his sons @entity148 and @entity149 all became @entity151 quarterbacks			0
@entity152 and his son @entity153 are both hockey hall - of - famers			1
@entity155 was a @entity156 leading man , and so is his son , @entity157			2
but those sons followed their fathers into the same job			0
the first @entity106 , though , was long dead by the time the second @entity106 determined that he wanted to go into business			0
there must be something genetic about the creative business urge ( or something in the @entity60 water ) ; the first @entity106 was n't around to teach the second @entity106 how to do it , yet the @entity168 built two completely different kinds of companies that on a national scale successfully fulfilled completely different consumer needs			0
and i just realized something : nine years ago , when a lifelong friend was dying of cancer and we who grew up with him and loved him were gathering to bid him farewell , we tried to think up a gift that would mean something special to him			2
i found , online , an antique shop in the @entity184 that had on hand an old dinner plate from a @entity25 ( the slogan of the restaurants , modest yet confident , was : " good as the @entity189			1
" the slogan was baked into every plate )			0
we 'd had so many @entity25 meals together , sitting shoulder - to - shoulder on those stools at the counter			1
we knew what the gift would represent to him			0
we were all going to sign the plate for our friend , so he could keep it on a shelf near his bed			0
we did n't have the luxury of waiting			0
so i asked the antique shop owners if there was a way they could get it to us quickly			0
it arrived the next day , for us to sign and present to him			0
after he passed away , his wife did me the kindness of giving me the sturdy old @entity25 plate , complete with all of our signatures on it -- and his			1
i 'm looking at it as i type these words			0
i realize only now that it was the first @entity106 's prized product , brought safely to us by his son			1
sometimes you have to just smile and shake your head			0
( now , if there was only some way for @entity128 to deliver a slice of that long - gone @entity25 banana cream pie			1
. ) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			1

@entity234 *wondered* why @entity2 menu sold @entity25 omelets
@entity25 eateries were a staple of his youth
@entity25 was the root of a *remarkable* father - son success story
the son of @entity25 's founder , grew up to succeed in a different *venture*
