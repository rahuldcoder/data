@entity0 , @entity1 -- relatives divided since 1953 reunited for the first time saturday at a @entity1 - built tourism resort in @entity6 amid tensions between the two sides			1
elderly men in suits and women in traditional @entity1 silk hanbok dresses sat at numbered tables in a large restaurant , many burst into tears ; some sat , spoke and exchanged photographs ; others simply looked bewildered as they clutched hands and stared into faces unseen for six decades			2
the relatives have been separated from since the 1950 - 53 @entity23			1
in @entity0 , the scenes at a tourism resort at @entity26 played on tv at a press room			0
" we have held a memorial service for you every year , " @entity29 told his @entity6 elder brother , @entity30 , 90			1
" i ca n't believe you are alive			0
" the oldest of the @entity1 , @entity34 , 96 , bear - hugged her @entity6 daughter , @entity36 , 71			1
@entity37 - sob , 81 , from @entity6 met his son @entity38 , 63 , from the @entity1 ; the two were separated when the son was three years old			1
the men clutched hands and exchanged photographs			0
the son appeared speechless as his father spoke to him			0
" our mother was waiting for you , but she died last year , " @entity45 told his older brother @entity46 , 81			1
" if only she had lived one more year ... " @entity50 - won , 79 , from @entity6 sat across from his younger sister @entity53 - sun from the @entity1			1

there were some remarkable stories			0
four @entity1 soldiers , initially believed killed in action in @entity6 , were alive			1
they met their family members from the @entity1			1
some 436 @entity1 , ranging in age from 12 to 96 , met 97 family members from @entity6			1
but some planned reunions did not go ahead ; some relatives had died in the past few days , while others were too ill or fragile to attend			2
the meetings , which stretch over three days , will be bittersweet ; the chances of any of the divided family members meeting again are slim			1
the tragedy of the divided families dates to the 1950 - 1953 @entity23 , when the @entity72 's division of the peninsula into two nations became permanent			2
amid fighting , millions of @entity6 became refugees -- either fleeing the violence or fearing political reprisals from one side or the other			2
in winter of 1950 , an estimated 650,000 refugees fled @entity6 when @entity83 forces retreated in the face of a surprise @entity86 offensive			2
there is no direct telephone or mail contact between the two @entity90 , but some families in the @entity1 have managed to broker surreptitious voice and written contact with their relatives in the @entity6 in recent years , as @entity6 's border with @entity86 has become more permeable and illegal cell phones have penetrated the insulated state			1
some 80,000 @entity1 have registered with their government to join one of the infrequent reunions , but 40,000 people are believed to have passed away or given up hope , according to the @entity1 's @entity103			1
numbers north of the @entity1 demilitarized zone are unknown			2
the first family reunions took place following a landmark summit between the two koreas in 2000			2
since then , 17,100 people representing 3,500 families have been reunited on 17 separate occasions			0
@entity0 has been keen to make the reunions a regular event			0
but in recent talks on the matter , the @entity6 has demanded 500,000 metric tons of rice and 300,000 metric tons of fertilizer to make the meetings a monthly event			0
the event comes amid tense inter-korean relations			0
the @entity123 continues to deny any involvement in the sinking of a @entity1 warship in march that killed 26 sailors			0
@entity0 , citing an international investigation , accuses @entity129 of a torpedo attack			0
on friday , the day before the reunions were due to begin , @entity6 troops fired two bullets at a @entity1 guard post			1
southern soldiers returned three rounds , and are demanding an explanation via the @entity83 ' @entity138			0
but the incident has not affected the reunions .			0
