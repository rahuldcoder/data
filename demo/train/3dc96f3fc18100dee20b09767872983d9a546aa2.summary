-- @entity2 fighters in @entity3 have made significant gains in the country , according to the latest statement purportedly from @entity7 's second - in - command , @entity9			1
@entity9 , pictured here in 2006 , also spoke about @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			2
the 25 - minute audio recording , titled " from @entity16 to @entity17 , " focuses primarily on the " important developments " in @entity3 , which @entity9 called " a step on the path of victory of @entity22			1
" @entity0 can not authenticate the message , which was released on sunday and was interspersed with television news reports and statements from various @entity7 - linked commanders			2
@entity0 analysts who listened to the recording say the voice is consistent with his intonation and accent			0
this is the third message from @entity9 espousing the views of the @entity7 terror network in 2009 ; the other two focused on @entity37 's recent military operation against @entity39 leaders in @entity12			1
in addition to @entity3 , @entity9 also addresses the situations in @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity9 praised @entity43 fighters in @entity3 who recently seized control of @entity46 , where the @entity48 - backed transitional government had been based			1
he warned the newly installed government , under president sheikh @entity50 , not to squander those gains by submitting " to @entity55 demands " and not abiding by sharia , or @entity22 law			0
" i call on my @entity57 brothers in beloved @entity3 ... to not be deceived by those who agree to the secularist constitutions which vie with the sharia in its right to rule , " he said			0
@entity9 also addressed the " awakening " in @entity11 , where many suspected @entity7 militants wanted in neighboring @entity63 are believed to have fled			1
that group includes several former detainees of the @entity55 military detention facility in @entity67 , @entity68			0
the @entity7 leader accused @entity11 president @entity70 and his government of being " servants and slaves " to the @entity55 by allowing @entity11 to be used as " a supply center ... against @entity57 countries			2
" " how can you agree to let the ruling authority in @entity11 be the @entity79 ? " @entity9 asked the people of @entity11			2
@entity9 spent the last eight minutes addressing the situation in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity12			0
his focus on @entity3 and @entity11 -- which accounted for more than 17 minutes of the 25 - minute address -- is a departure from the topics of his previous messages			1
@entity0 terrorism analyst @entity86 suggested that is a reflection of @entity7 's recent losses as a result of @entity55 missile strikes along the @entity13 - @entity14 border			2
" there were three in 2007 and 34 in 2008 by my count , " @entity86 said			0
" these strikes are causing @entity7 leaders to consider their options			0
" @entity7 has considered relocating its base to @entity3 or @entity11 , according to a former @entity55 official who is familiar with the intelligence			1
other analysts have suggested that it would be difficult for @entity7 to gain a stronghold in @entity3 because its radical agenda is unpopular in the moderate @entity22 country			0
@entity107 , who studies the @entity108 for the @entity109 think tank , said he expects @entity43 's overseas ties to dry up after the recent withdrawal of @entity113 forces , which was its only basis of support in @entity3			0
@entity116 , director of the @entity118 program for the @entity119 , said it is unlikely @entity3 will emerge as " a breeding ground for terrorism " because of its clan - based society			0
but @entity86 noted that both @entity3 and @entity11 lack a strong central government and " therefore ( are ) attractive locations for @entity7			2
" " @entity7 also has had an on - and - off presence in @entity3 since 1992 and even earlier in @entity11 , " he said			1
" as we have seen also , @entity11 's weak government and permissive attitude to jihadists have made it an increasingly attractive venue for @entity63 members of @entity7			0
" @entity86 said that is most likely why @entity9 chose to focus more than half of his latest message on @entity11 and @entity3 .			1
