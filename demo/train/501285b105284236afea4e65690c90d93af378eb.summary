-- since the early days of pop music , the music industry has been searching for the secret formula to writing a successful song -- for that special alchemy that separates a grammy - winner from a dud			1
for a period in the 1970s and 80s , the self - styled @entity9 @entity8 seemed to have stumbled upon it , but somewhere along the line he , too , seems to have misplaced it			0
@entity14 claims to be able to predict whether a song will be a pop hit but now a piece of software claims it can compute whether a song has chart - topping potential , and a number of record companies and musicians are using @entity14 ( @entity14 ) to gauge whether they have a hit on their hands			1
the software , developed by @entity28 - based @entity27 , works by breaking down more than 60 elements of a song , including melody , harmony , tempo , pitch , octave , beat , rhythm , fullness of sound , noise , brilliance and chord progression , and compares it against a database of over 3.5 million past commercial hits			1
the program organizes songs into clusters with similar - sounding equivalents and then rates the song on a scale of one to ten , with a score of 7.3 being deemed likely to do well in the music charts			1
curiously , clusters of songs do not necessarily contain songs that sound the same to the human ear , but from a mathematical perspective they share similarities			0
@entity14 analyzed music from @entity60 ' first album before she broke through and the program 's algorithms placed her in a cluster with @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
if you have ever wondered why you sometimes find yourself humming along to some smooth jazz on the radio when you consider yourself a strict thrash metal fan only , then perhaps @entity14 has discovered the scientific answer			1
besides @entity60 , the program also predicted success for @entity74 , while " @entity75 , " a song penned by @entity77 , a singer - songwriter from @entity78 , was rated as a potential hit by @entity14 , who recommended it to @entity82 in the @entity83			1
it eventually ended up as a vehicle for @entity87 band member @entity86 and scored a respectable @entity83 chart position of 16 in 2005			0
record producer @entity89 , director of @entity91 and @entity92 in @entity93 , believes that the software has a high accuracy rate			1
" i was very skeptical when i was told about it for the first time , " he says			0
" i thought it was science fiction			0
" but when we choose a tune for an artist and we like it and feel it will be a hit , the surprise is that 85 percent of the time the tracks we have chosen get a positive analysis from the software			1
" the emergence of hit prediction programs such as this -- @entity112 - based @entity111 provides a similar service -- raises concerns that the creative element of writing music would be eroded by breaking it down into mathematical algorithms			1
but @entity89 claims the program in no way writes a song , it simply tells you whether it has the potential to be a hit			1
he says he mainly uses the software to tweak and refine songs so that he can maximize his chances of scoring a high chart position			1
" there was a particular case where we had to revise the song as at first it was n't completely right			2
using the software , we managed to make it work , " he explains			2
" the problem with the software is that it can only indicate whether a song is suitable or not			1
it 's up to the producer , the technical team and the artist to make it suitable in the first place			2
" @entity89 has since become a member of @entity27 ' advisory board , so he is bound to have a positive take on the service			0
@entity148 , general manager @entity149 , claims the company has thirty to forty clients in the record industry in @entity154 and the @entity155 , but she says she can not reveal who they are , citing privacy issues			1
@entity0 attempted to contact several record companies in @entity159 , but a&r departments claimed they had not heard of the service , suggesting either a certain coyness to admit using it or that it is not as widely used as @entity111 claims			1
the software can also be used as a way of recommending new music to audiences			2
in @entity93 , cellular phone company @entity167 is using the technology in its @entity171 enterprise			2
listeners can enter in their favorite songs and the program will suggest songs they might enjoy according to its cluster system			0
@entity178 is one musician who has profited from this new way of connecting musicians with an audience			0
a national tennis monitor by profession , he struggled to make an impact in the music industry despite the best efforts of @entity189 , one of @entity93 's most successful music producers			2
but since the @entity167 initiative his career has taken off and he is now selling well through @entity167 and touring the country			0
" a machine or at least mathematical or scientific formulas that could analyze the parameters that a song needs to be a hit ? the truth is i doubted it at first , " he says			1
" my first instinct was it must be a con			0
" do n't ask me what parameters they use , or formulas , or machines they use , because i do n't know			0
" but the software has its skeptics			2
@entity210 , writer and producer of @entity213 's new single " 2 @entity212 " is unconvinced about the accuracy of the program			2
he entered tracks from her new @entity217 and they were , unsurprisingly , rated as potential hits			1
but he also entered a little - known , unreleased , song by 70s band @entity221 that included cows mooing , and it was also rated as a potential chart - topper			2
he thinks that the program negates the unpredictability of human behavior			0
" the fact is that it 's the human errors introduced in the music - making process that are always the most interesting , " he says			0
" who would have thought @entity232 would do so well ? i doubt anyone would have predicted that			0
" it 's so hard to categorize music			0
there 's a real danger of doing that			0
if you are writing and producing music you can try to fit it to certain formulas but it 's so abstract that it has to be free -- and then something good will happen			0
" with just one fifth of their musicians making a profit for today 's record companies , executives are always searching for new ways to narrow the risk margin			0
@entity14 may become a useful string in their bow in the elusive art of predicting a hit			1
otherwise they will have to keep relying on tried and tested -- and more human -- methods , such as gut instinct			0

@entity28 company claims its software can tell if a song will be a pop hit
@entity14 analyzes song 's melody , harmony , tempo , beat
software can not write hits , just predict whether they will find success
@entity276 says a&r departments are using it to tweak tracks for the top
