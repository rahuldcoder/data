@entity5 , @entity6 the trial of the man accused of killing @entity2 , the protagonist in the top - selling book and hit movie " @entity2 , " began wednesday with a lawyer using @entity2 's own words to bolster an insanity defense			1
@entity11 is accused of killing @entity2 and @entity13 's friend , @entity12 , at a firing range at @entity15 , about 90 miles southwest of @entity16 on february 2 , 2013			1
in his opening statement , defense attorney @entity17 read a text @entity2 sent to @entity20 about @entity11 as the three men rode in @entity2 's pickup truck to the range			1
" about an hour and a half into the drive , @entity2 was sitting in the driver 's seat and he texts @entity12 sitting right next to him			1
he texts , ' this dude is straight - up nuts , ' " @entity17 said			1
" @entity12 texts @entity2 back , ' he 's right behind me , watch my six [ military lingo for ' watch my back			1
so while we do n't know what the conversation was , we do know what @entity2 was thinking at the time he was in that truck			1
" @entity17 said @entity11 killed the two men because he suffered " a psychosis so severe that at that point in time he did not know what he was doing was wrong			1
... he thought in his mind at that moment in time it was either him or them			2
" but @entity46 district attorney @entity45 told the jury that @entity11 told investigators he used drugs and drank whiskey that morning			1
he admitted that he killed the two men and said he " knew what he was doing was wrong , " the prosecutor said			2
@entity11 used two guns , @entity45 said			1
@entity11 shot @entity2 five times in the back and side and once in the side of the head , using a .45 - caliber pistol , and shot @entity12 with a 9 mm pistol four times in the back , once in the hand , once in the face and once in the head , @entity45 said			1
a different .45 - caliber pistol with all its rounds fired was found on the ground near @entity2 's head , @entity45 said			1
" ( @entity2 ) had shot all the bullets in his gun when he was shot in the back , " said @entity45 , referring to the fact that @entity2 had just fired at a target			1
the trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about @entity2 , a former @entity81 seal who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in @entity85 history with 160 confirmed kills in @entity87			1
the film has grossed more than $ 280 million , the most ever for a war movie , and the autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best - seller lists			2
the first witness with @entity2 's widow			1
@entity94 recounted the last conversation with her husband , on the phone			2
" i said are you ok ? " she said			2
" he said ' yep			2
' and that 's not common for him			0
i could tell something was up and he was just quiet ... " on that day , @entity2 took @entity12 and @entity11 , a troubled veteran he was trying to help , to the firing range			1
@entity94 said her husband sounded irritated			0
" normally , going out there , especially a place like @entity15 -- usually it 's beautiful			0
he feels really good about helping somebody			0
he 's making their day and he knows it , " she testified			0
" earlier , he thought that guy sounded really excited to go , so he thought he was doing a good thing			0
" she said their last conversation " was very short , and it was n't short like , ' hey , you are interrupting a good time			0
' it was short like , ' i wish i could say more but i 'm not going to because there were people around			0
' " later she texted and he did n't reply , and she became worried , she testified			0
@entity2 had already risen to fame through his book when he died			1
he 'd been doing charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder			0
the range is a small , remote part of the sprawling 11,000 - acre @entity15 , and the men were isolated , authorities said			1
@entity135 , resident manager of @entity15 , testified @entity2 had " exclusive access to the range when he came out			1
" @entity2 had said he was going to use the range for about 45 minutes , @entity135 testified , but " about 5 p.m. i got a radio call that said i had to go to the shooting range			1
" a hunting guide found @entity2 , 38 , and @entity12 , 35 , @entity2 's friend , motionless and called 911			1
the men were dead when officers arrived			0
jurors were shown graphic photos of their bodies			0
@entity94 was in the courtroom at the time			0
@entity11 , an unemployed former @entity152 reportedly diagnosed with @entity153 , was gone , and so was @entity2 's black @entity155 pickup , police said			1
@entity11 drove up in @entity2 's truck at his sister 's house 65 miles away , police said			1
she called 911 , telling the operator he claimed to have killed two men			0
" they went out to a shooting range			2
like , he 's all crazy , " @entity11 's sister told authorities			1
@entity11 got back into the truck and hit the road again , police said			1
officers caught up with him that evening at his home in a @entity16 suburb			0
while talking with police , he jumped back into the truck and sped off again , police say			0
they gave chase and stopped him after spiking his tires			0
he did not struggle when they arrested him , police said			0
relatives of @entity11 , 27 , and those close to him declined interview requests from @entity7			1
@entity11 's attorney is making the case that his client is not guilty by reason of insanity			1
since july 24 , 2013 , when a judge filed a gag order in the case , nobody associated with @entity11 's trial has been permitted to speak to the media			2
before that order was issued , a reporter asked capt. @entity194 of the @entity196 what could have driven @entity11 to the alleged murders			2
" i do n't know that we 'll ever know , " @entity199 said			0
@entity11 served in the @entity152 from june 2006 to june 2010			2
his time in the military included a 2007 tour of duty in @entity87 and a humanitarian mission to help the victims of the devastating 2010 earthquake in @entity207			0
@entity2 learned to shoot on hunting trips with his father , then went on to serve four combat tours in @entity87 with the @entity211 , though his official biography notes he also worked with @entity213 and @entity152 units			2
he received two @entity215 and other commendations before leaving the @entity81 in 2009 after 160 confirmed kills , which he called a record for an @entity85			0
he said that while killing did not come easy at first , he knew it meant saving lives			2
" the first time , you 're not even sure you can do it , " he said in the interview			0
" but i 'm not over there looking at these people as people			0
i 'm not wondering if he has a family			0
i 'm just trying to keep my guys safe			0
" @entity2 's story and the movie made from it have triggered broad enthusiasm but also drawn critics and doubts about his accounts			2
a sniper 's view : ' when you are bred to kill , you know ' correction : earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of @entity12 , who was killed with @entity2			2
@entity12 was not a veteran			0
@entity7 's @entity246 reported from @entity5 , @entity6 , and @entity247 and @entity248 wrote from @entity249			0
@entity250 and @entity251 contributed to this report .			0
