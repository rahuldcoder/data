-- @entity1 took advantage of a rare sign of vulnerability from the all - conquering @entity6 team to score his maiden victory in a thrilling finish to the @entity10 @entity9 sunday			1
the @entity12 rookie overtook title leader @entity13 in the closing stages of the 70 - lap race in @entity16 and took the checkered flag under the safety car after @entity19 of @entity20 and @entity21 in his @entity22 crashed while battling for minor places			1
it was an astonishing turn around after another race set to be dominated by @entity6 with title leader @entity13 battling to hold off teammate @entity27 for the honors			1
the early stages had been marked by an early safety car when the two @entity31 of @entity33 @entity32 and @entity35 @entity34 's collided on the first lap. @entity13 , who started from pole , eventually came under pressure from @entity27 , who had initially lost second place to @entity40			1
but both suffered power problems , allowing the pack to close up with @entity19 briefly taking the lead			0
@entity27 finally passed @entity13 to take second , but then was forced to retire with a rear brake problem			1
@entity13 , who reclaimed the lead , was unable to hold off the charging @entity1 , but will be consoled by opening up a potentially decisive 22 - point lead in the championship race over @entity27			1
in a fine day for @entity12 , four - time champion @entity40 completed the final podium spot , but has been beaten by his precocious teammate in the last five races			2
" i am still a bit in shock , " @entity1 said at the presentations			2
" @entity27 had a problem and @entity13 was slow down the straights , " he revealed			1
" i really struggled to get past ( @entity21 ) @entity21 but managed to finally get a run out of the last chicane and get a nice run out of turn one and set my sights on @entity13 with couple of laps to go			2
" i finally managed to get in the right spot to use @entity64 and it 's an amazing feeling right now			0
" @entity13 , winner of the last race in @entity67 , had made a brave attempt to hold on to his lead			0
" i lost a lot of power in the straights but it did not quite work out			0
i could n't hold off @entity1 , " he admitted			0
behind the front runners , @entity73 took a fine fourth for @entity76 with @entity77 in fifth for @entity22 and @entity78 sixth for @entity79			0
@entity81 @entity80 was seventh in the second @entity20 ahead of @entity35 @entity82 of @entity83			0
@entity85 rookie @entity84 in the second @entity76 and @entity86 in the second @entity79 completed the points scoring			0
@entity21 and @entity19 , who walked away from their 240kph crashes , were classified 11th and 12th , scant consolation after both scented victory as @entity6 faltered .			2
