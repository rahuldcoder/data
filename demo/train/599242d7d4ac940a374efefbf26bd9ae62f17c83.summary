-- while several @entity6 countries have long had their own versions of " @entity8 , " the longest running televised pop music competition where fans choose their favorite songs and singers is @entity6 's @entity9 , now in its 56th year			1
saturday evening , @entity10 won the 2011 running of the annual competition , with a sweet pop song that @entity6 slowly fell in love with during the course of the contest , titled " @entity17 , " by @entity18 and @entity19 ( also known as @entity20 / @entity19 )			1
the song , somewhat of a surprise winner to many , beat out early favorites from @entity24 and @entity25 to win over @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity27 's @entity28 was winning the contest in the early going , until it became apparent that @entity18 and @entity19 would run away with a trophy			1
ironically , @entity27 @entity31 and @entity32 wrote @entity10 's song , making saturday night a win for @entity27 all around -- @entity28 came in third at the competition			1
@entity26 's @entity37 was second			1
but the true victors saturday were @entity10 's @entity18 and @entity19 , who seemed stunned yet ecstatic just after the ceremony			1
" we 're very happy right now			0
... we 're very proud , " said @entity20 at a post-show press conference			0
the winner was determined by fans across @entity6 who voted by phone , and a jury made up of music industry professionals			1
saturday 's final capped off two weeks of fanfare surrounding the event , and followed two semifinals and a kind of dress rehearsal , a jury final , on friday evening			2
some 36,000 watched saturday 's @entity54 event live from a stadium in @entity56 , @entity57 , which was chosen as the host city for 2011 after @entity57 won the song competition in 2010 with @entity61 's " satellite			1
" it was the first time in 28 years @entity57 had played host to @entity9 fans			1
@entity61 , who represented @entity57 again in 2011 to defend her title , did not do quite as well this year , with her " @entity66 " placing 10th			1
" satellite " wowed crowds last year , making @entity61 a star in @entity57 seen often on tv and on billboards			1
ratings for saturday 's grand finale fared well around @entity6 , but within @entity57 , semifinal viewership was down this year , with some @entity57 newspapers citing " @entity61 fatigue " as one reason fewer @entity57 seemed excited in 2011 for the annual pop music contest			1
conversely , interest in the annual competition spiked this year in @entity25 - speaking countries , largely due to strong contenders from both the @entity83 ( contemporary boy band @entity84 ) and @entity85 , which sent a pair of identical twins ( @entity88 )			2
@entity90 ratings for both semifinals earlier this week nearly doubled last year 's numbers			1
the number of @entity25 and @entity85 fans also seemed high saturday night in @entity57 , where @entity83 tourists swarmed @entity56 's arena , showing patriotism with the kind of colorful clothing usually reserved for soccer matches			1
ratings for saturday 's final were also up in @entity102 and @entity103 compared with 2010 viewership , according to newspaper reports			0
so what 's behind the enduring appeal of the @entity9 for fans from as far away as @entity110 ? according to @entity111 , who wrote " the @entity9 : the @entity117 , " it 's a mix of curiosity and love of music			2
" you can come at it from any angle you like , " he said outside the arena friday before the jury final , which precedes the actual grand final and makes up 50 % of the vote determining who wins the annual competition			0
" one can watch it to see how appallingly bad the talent will be , or one can watch it to see how good it 's going to be			0
... neither of those opinions is invalid , " he said			0
" it 's an entertainment show			0
" and the entertainment was there during saturday 's @entity54 , with production values approaching something like a @entity141 concert -- think state - of - the - art indoor pyrotechnics and lighting displays tailored to each individual country 's stage set			0
while many @entity147 were unaware the competition took place this past week , the @entity147 did have a stake in the game , via a few @entity147 - based songwriters , who were likely watching online saturday , awaiting results			0
@entity155 - based songwriters in particular were paying attention			0
@entity157 and @entity158 wrote @entity61 's " @entity66 , " while @entity161 ' @entity160 co-wrote @entity162 ' " @entity159 " for @entity163			2
but the biggest @entity155 - based name who generated interest in @entity9 this year was @entity168 producer @entity167			0
the songsmith co-wrote @entity171 's entry for 2011 , @entity172 's " get you , " which did n't fare as well saturday night as many had hoped , yet still impressed many			0
" the universal language is music , " the songwriter said from a private pressroom before the event saturday night , after a crush of @entity171 photographers snapped pictures of him and @entity172 together			0
" all the borders are falling away ( because of the @entity187 ) , " said the hitmaker , currently riding high on world pop charts with his and @entity185 's hot " @entity184			2
" " @entity190 has no boundaries , " he added , noting he had been tweeting about his newly signed @entity171 artist , @entity172 , who performed in the finals saturday			0
" i grew up watching @entity9 , " said the producer , who lived in @entity27 before immigrating to @entity147			2
so will @entity147 care next year about a televised song competition which does n't air in the @entity147 ? @entity167 , for one , hopes so			2
" it 's a beautiful contest because it 's all about the songs and the artists , " he said			2
" it 's like ' @entity8 , ' but with original songs			0
americans should really get into it			0

@entity18 and @entity19 of @entity10 win with sweet pop song " @entity17 "
@entity26 is second , @entity27 third in contest viewed by fans across @entity6
viewer votes and music industry jury combine to determine winner
last year 's winner , @entity57 's @entity61 , came in 10th
