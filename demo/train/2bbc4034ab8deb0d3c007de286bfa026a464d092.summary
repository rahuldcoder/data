@entity0 -- the @entity0 @entity2 in @entity3 held an emergency session thursday to discuss and condemn widespread rapes in eastern @entity6 , while the @entity8 ambassador to the @entity0 said she was troubled by a briefing on the attacks			1
" we are horrified , and we are outraged , and that led us , in conjunction with the @entity15 , to request this detailed briefing this morning , " said @entity11 , the @entity8 ambassador to the @entity0 , on thursday			1
" it was a disturbing briefing , both for what we learned and what we do n't know still			0
" the @entity0 peacekeeping mission in eastern @entity6 was aware that @entity23 rebels were occupying villages in the region in late july and early august , but did not know of reports that the rebels were raping women in those villages , @entity0 officials said this week			1
nearly 200 women were gang - raped by hundreds of @entity23 and @entity6 rebels , humanitarian officials said			1
@entity33 , a representative for @entity0 @entity34 ban ki - moon , said the @entity0 was alerted to rebel activity in the area but was not notified of the mass rapes			1
" there was no particular question of an attack , much less the kind of events like mass rape , " @entity33 said wednesday			2
but a senior @entity0 official said thursday that the @entity0 was to blame for the incident and that the organization should leave the @entity6 if it could not protect civilians			1
" we are guilty of a conspiracy of silence , " said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a current member of the peacekeeping mission in @entity6 and is under orders not to criticize the @entity0 publicly			1
" if we ca n't help civilians , there is no point in being here			0
" " these things happen all the time			0
it may not be 180 , it may be 10 , but it happens all the time , " the official said			2
" our colleagues are part of the problem -- it 's pretty bad			0
" " they take it for granted , that people in @entity6 just have to suffer , " the official continued			1
" some of the people in our hierarchy keep saying ' it 's not going to change ' ... they just seem apathetic			0
it is very rare to meet anyone who wants to make a difference			0
" the @entity0 did not reply to requests for comment on allegations thursday evening			1
@entity0 officials said that an e-mail warning of rebel activities was sent to @entity0 and other staff working in the area			1
@entity83 , a spokesman for the @entity0 peacekeeping mission in eastern @entity6 -- known by the acronym @entity86 -- said the @entity0 was first alerted to the rapes by humanitarian organizations on august 12			1
the @entity0 , which maintains a number of peacekeeping bases in the region , made its first public comments on the attacks monday			1
but the account of the delay was disputed by the @entity96 , a non-governmental organization that operates in the region			0
@entity96 spokeswoman @entity98 told @entity1 that her group informed the @entity0 's @entity100 about the rapes on august 6 , a day after @entity96 representatives had visited the affected villages			1
@entity104 said that she and the @entity15 ambassador asked many questions about the situation on thursday			2
" i just want to take this opportunity to reiterate from the @entity8 point of view our strongest possible condemnation of the rapes and attacks that occurred against scores of innocent civilians , " she said after the briefing			1
@entity117 , of the @entity118 and this month 's @entity2 president , said thursday , " the members of the @entity2 reiterated their demand that all parties with the armed conflict immediately cease completely all forms of sexual violence and all human rights abuses against the civilian population of the @entity6 , including gender - based violence including rape and other forms of sexual abuse			1
" according to humanitarian organizations , rebels raided a network of villages in @entity136 between july 30 and august 3 and raped 179 women			1
many of them were gang - raped individually by between two to six men			2
a @entity0 peacekeeper military base was within 30 kilometers ( about 19 miles ) of the general area of the attacks , in the town of @entity145			1
" we had regular patrols in this area during that period , " @entity83 told @entity1 by phone from @entity147 wednesday			0
" unfortunately , the villagers and the local authorities never brought this issue to our knowledge			0
if we are not informed , it will be difficult for us to know , " he added			0
@entity158 , director for the @entity96 in the @entity6 , said he was among the first group of people to visit the site of the attacks			1
" two hundred to 400 armed men systematically pillaged and raped women in the villages , " @entity158 said			2
" the rebels entered , tried to calm the population down by telling them they came for food and rest , and so [ they ] should n't flee , " he said			0
" another group came at night and it was then they started harassing the population			0
" armed men often raped the women in front of their children and husbands , @entity96 said in a news release			2
" large numbers of women reported being physically beaten before the sexual assaults , and some reported abuse of babies who were forcibly removed from their arms			0
the perpetrators simultaneously pillaged the entire village and smaller neighboring villages , before leaving			0
" during the four - day attack across 16 villages , according to the @entity0 , rebels from the @entity190 , as well as militiamen from the notorious @entity193 movement , also looted villages			1
an earlier report said three peacekeepers were killed and seven others were wounded , but those deaths and injuries stemmed from a previous incident			0
@entity203 said tuesday he was " outraged " by the attacks			0
" this is another grave example of both the level of sexual violence and the insecurity that continue to plague the @entity6 , " @entity203 said in a statement			2
he has dispatched a senior representative -- @entity211 , his assistant secretary - general for peacekeeping operations -- to the affected areas in and around @entity215 , the epicenter of the rapes , to meet with victims			0
@entity219 , the secretary - general 's special representative on sexual violence , was expected to stop in @entity222 , the capital of @entity136 province , before going on to visit @entity215			0
@entity117 , the @entity2 president , said the council welcomed the secretary - general 's decision to dispatch a special representative to consult with authorities in @entity6			2
that representative , @entity117 said , would dig for facts about the rapes and assess what more could be done to ensure effective protection of civilians			0
in @entity237 , @entity236 secretary @entity235 said wednesday she was " deeply concerned " by the reports			0
" the @entity8 has repeatedly condemned the epidemic of sexual violence in conflict zones around the world , and we will continue to speak out on this issue for those who can not speak for themselves , " she said in a statement			2
" the @entity8 will do everything we can to work with the @entity0 and the @entity6 government to hold the perpetrators of these acts accountable , and to create a safe environment for women , girls and all civilians living in the eastern @entity6			1
" @entity203 has called on @entity6 authorities to investigate the rapes and bring the perpetrators to justice , and for the government to step up its efforts to ensure civilian security			1
officials with @entity86 will hold an internal staff meeting between the civilian and military departments thursday in @entity222			0
