-- @entity1 has dialed up its competition in the search - engine wars with the introduction of a daily deals facility on @entity6			1
@entity1 knows daily deals are the hottest meme at the moment , so its announcement is suitably cheeky and aggressively street - hawkeresque ( we kid ) : " calling all bargain hunters , deal lovers , @entity15 groupies and @entity17 fanatics ! things just got easier " it trumpets , making no bones about mentioning the biggest name in daily deals right now , @entity15 , to gin up interest in its service			1
@entity25 arrived thursday on desktop pcs and smartphones ( where it 's possibly most useful ) via @entity6 's dedicated , simpler , mobile site m.bing.com			1
it promises to give access to " more than 20,000 unique offers in over 14,000 cities and towns across the @entity35 " but how has @entity1 managed to amass such a diverse coverage and ad - partnership pool already , you may wonder ? the answer is that @entity6 , unlike @entity41 's more head - on direct competitor efforts , is actually assembling daily deal offers from sites like @entity15 , @entity17 , @entity44 " to name a few " into one location , making it easy to work out where you can find a super-cheap purchase , or perhaps a spontaneous birthday gift for someone			1
it 's using technology from @entity54 ( " a leading source for people to find and share the best local deals " ) to power its systems , which means as well as location - based deal discovery , you 'll also be able to share results with people via email			0
it seems the system is spread throughout @entity6 , as well -- if you search for a local restaurant using @entity6 , then the engine will " make sure you know " about any deals that establishment may have available by listing them directly beneath the business details in the search window			0
the system appears ideal for consumers previously uninterested in deals sites like @entity15 -- which may offset the slight brand erosion each of these individual sites may suffer as their deal offers are wrapped into @entity6 's front - end @entity80			2
in launching daily deals , @entity6 is stepping up its competition with @entity41 and jumping aboard the ( already bursting ) daily deals bandwagon			2
with new data suggesting total revenues from daily deals services could reach as much as $ 6 billion by 2015 in the @entity35 alone , this is a fast - growing market segment that @entity1 simply ca n't ignore			0
so how can @entity1 grab a share of this if it 's just gathering together everyone else 's deals ? by selling ads to you when you surf to its pages			0
