-- a high - profile defector from @entity5 president @entity4 's regime fled the country because he is outraged over the government 's brutality , an activist told @entity0			1
@entity9 , a @entity5 journalist and opposition activist , said he spoke to @entity11			1
gen. @entity12 on thursday night during an interview on @entity14			1
@entity12 is a @entity15 military commander , the son of a former defense minister and possibly the most senior @entity17 in a power structure dominated by the @entity20 minority			1
he escaped from the @entity5 city of @entity22 to @entity23 with the help of the @entity25 of the rebel @entity26 , @entity9 said			2
but his whereabouts at present are not known , said @entity9 , who once worked as a translator and journalist for @entity0			0
a @entity31 diplomat who reported the defection said @entity12 has been estranged from the regime over the killing of @entity17			1
@entity35 said @entity12 passed on similar sentiments , calling the regime brutal and @entity4 a dictator			1
he said @entity12 said he left the regime because he does n't want to be involved in any actions that would harm @entity5			1
@entity12 said he 's not going to join the opposition now , @entity9 said			1
but a @entity43 official who is not authorized to speak on the record said if @entity12 did join the insurgency , it would be " significant			1
" reports of @entity12 ' defection first surfaced thursday , and @entity31 officials are saying he is on his way to @entity51			1
his father , former defense minister @entity54 , and the rest of his family are in @entity51 , the official said			2
@entity5 has been engulfed in nearly 16 months of unrest , resulting in thousands of deaths			2
@entity12 ' defection comes as government assaults against protesters led to a nationwide uprising			2
his departure is regarded as a stunning blow to the embattled regime			0
" he 's an inside confidant of @entity4			1
so it counts that even an insider thinks it 's time to go , " said one @entity31 official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
@entity73 spokesman capt. @entity72 said the " crack in the inner circle " is " significant " because of @entity12 ' position and ties with the @entity56			2
" we do n't believe this defection should be taken lightly , " he said			0
@entity80 , @entity5 expert at the @entity81 , said it 's " by far the biggest defection			1
" " this is a good - sized step in the right direction , " he said @entity85 family knows " how the place is wired			1
" @entity89 , spokeswoman for the opposition @entity90 , called the development " quite significant			0
" " it signals that the domino effect of defections is speeding up as longtime regime supporters and collaborators realize that @entity4 's ship is sinking fast			1
expect more defections in the coming days as the regime accelerates its scorched - earth policy in a desperate attempt to destroy as much as possible before falling apart , " she told @entity0			0
@entity103 , a defense fellow at the @entity81 , said the defection " raises questions about the cohesions of his brigade and division			0
" @entity103 recently wrote an essay describing the mounting pressures on the @entity5 military , including the growing opposition clout and defections			1
he told @entity0 on friday that the " defection process is accelerating somewhat and that we are getting more reports of higher - ranking officers leaving			0
" @entity12 had been " the commander of an important regime protection unit , a component of the @entity121 , whose main responsibility in the current conflict has been the defense of @entity126 , " @entity103 said			1
the defection reflects two important trends , he said			0
one is that many of the higher - ranking defectors are staff officers and medical officers			0
@entity12 , in contrast , is from a combat unit			2
" if we start seeing more defections from the higher ranks of combat units that will be significant , " @entity103 said			0
the move also might indicate that the regime " can not count on the @entity17 it has so far kept in the fold			1
" " it will create suspicions within the regime about ' loyalist ' @entity17 and ' loyalist ' @entity17 will be wondering what the regime has in store for them			1
some will likely split , if they can find a safe path for themselves and their families			0
@entity12 's defection will undoubtedly heighten the awareness of the regime 's security personnel			1
" @entity157 , a former @entity43 ambassador to @entity5 , said the defection was " psychologically " important , " but it 's not going to bring down the regime			1
" he said a " much bigger blow " would be the defection of an @entity20 senior officer			0
@entity163 , a @entity5 expert at the @entity164 , said thursday in a post on his blog @entity163 that if @entity12 has indeed fled the country , " the regime will be thrown back on its heels			1
" @entity12 " was a close confidant of @entity4 from his earliest days and part of his inner circle , " @entity163 said			1
and he " supported a policy of negotiation , flexibility and compromise " but " was overruled by the military leadership and has since looked for a way out			0
" for example , @entity12 had been ordered to solve problems in the restive @entity126 suburban towns of @entity182 and @entity183 , @entity163 said			2
" he did a good job by negotiating with the opposition leaders in both suburbs , agreeing that both government forces and opposition would pull back , " @entity163 said			0
but , @entity163 said , the " @entity20 leadership said ' no , that is not how we are going to do this			0
' they pushed him aside and came down like a ton of bricks on the opposition in both neighborhoods , in an effort to assert state authority and crush the uprising through military means			0
" @entity12 is " perhaps the most senior @entity17 in the regime because he was a close friend of @entity4 , " @entity163 wrote			1
" for 16 months the opposition has been complaining that elite @entity17 have not defected			2
that complaint can now , officially , be put to rest if the stories of @entity12 's flight prove to be true			2
in march it was rumored that he had led with his father and brother , but those stories were false , " he wrote			0
@entity12 exudes charisma , and @entity163 describes him as " smart , dashing and cunning			2
" " @entity12 is as handsome as a movie star and carried a lot of authority			2
he was a true military guy and had spent his entire life in the military , unlike @entity4			2
people close to him say that when he walked into a room , all eyes turned to him			0
not only did women find him attractive , but men did as well			0
he carried himself with an air of self - confidence and authority , " @entity163 said			0
the @entity12 family has been part of the @entity5 power structure during the tenure of @entity4 and his father , @entity233			1
" when foreign statesmen or @entity5 thought of a @entity17 who could possibly take power , @entity12 had to be at the top of the list or very close to the top , " he said			1
" @entity12 is respected by @entity4 's generation and a military leader			1
" there has been a lot of buzz about the development on the streets of @entity126 and the pages of @entity248			0
one man wrote it 's important because the @entity12 family was n't just pro-regime , " they are the regime			1
" another activist said , " you idiots , defect before it 's too late			0
@entity12 saved himself at the very last moment			2
" while opposition voices welcome the move , they voiced suspicion and scorn			0
" should we work with him ? no , never , " said one			0
another said , " ( @entity264 ) e and his father and brother should return the money they stole from the @entity5 people first			2
" this comment is an apparent reference to @entity12 ' brother @entity272 , a businessman			0
@entity273 has been in favor of reform in @entity5			0
he told reporters in 2005 there was a " huge expectation " from @entity5 of economic change			0
@entity0 's @entity280 , @entity281 and journalist @entity282 contributed to this report .			0
