@entity1 , @entity0 -- a new generation of deep - sea submarines light enough to launch from a yacht could open up the ocean 's depths to amateur explorers			1
the planned " @entity10 " -- shown here in an artist 's impression -- should be able to dive to 37,000 ft. the " @entity10 " winged submersibles are experimental prototypes designed to dive to depths of up to 37,000 ft -- almost four times as deep as a giant squid dives -- descending at 400 ft / minute			1
they are the brainchild of submarine designer @entity22 who is in the process of building commercial models that can reach those depths			1
@entity22 has been designing submarines since the 1960s , working initially with the @entity28 and then for the oil industry			2
he now sells his designs to wealthy sailboat owners as the ultimate yacht accessory			0
" if you have the money for a mega-yacht and you 're just limited to the surface , then what a waste			0
that 's my perspective , " @entity22 told @entity2 in a telephone interview			2
the late billionaire balloonist and adventurer , @entity45 , commissioned one of @entity22 ' experimental prototypes , " @entity42 , " which can dive to 37,000 ft. the craft was four weeks away from delivery when he died			1
venture capitalist @entity51 has ordered one of @entity22 ' first commercially - available models , " @entity55 " for his yacht " @entity54			1
" the $ 1.5 million sub is capable of diving to 1,000 ft and comes complete with air conditioning			1
while price means these craft are out of reach for most leisure users , @entity22 denies they are simply rich men 's toys			1
" the thing is a space ship , i do n't like the term toy , " said @entity22 of the subs which his company is also positioning as a cheaper alternative to research craft for science , industry and exploration			2
" ' @entity55 ' has a capability greater than the @entity77			1
" i personally very much like the idea of empowering individuals to explore			0
" unlike conventional subs which get heavy and sink , @entity22 ' designs are positively buoyant and have to power down into the depths : " it 's like an airplane in reverse			0
" they have life support good for 24 hours in the depths and a range of 10 - 20 miles			0
they are also quick and highly maneuverable			0
@entity22 , who describes himself as claustrophobic , says diving deep in one of his subs is an " awe inspiring experience			2
" " we just finished flight testing ' @entity55			0
it goes down vertical and you pull one gee when you make a turn , " he said			0

deep - sea sub that can dive to 37,000 ft is light enough to launch from a yacht
brainchild of designer @entity22 who is in process of producing first craft
" @entity115 " has no price *tag* yet but *current* sub " @entity55 " cost $ 1.5 million
@entity22 : @entity55 has a capability greater than the @entity77
