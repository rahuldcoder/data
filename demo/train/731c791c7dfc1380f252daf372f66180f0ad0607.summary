when you have a demanding full - time job , a cute but fussy baby , an elderly parent who needs attending and something of a social life ? i suggested that he listen to @entity12 , watch @entity0 -- and once in a while choose a particular story to follow			1
for example , the report of what happens when major @entity17 corporations break the law			2
the @entity20 recently investigated the ways the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) deals with companies who have violated anti-fraud laws			1
very often , the settlement that follows contains a promise not to break the law again , which the @entity20 noted is odd because the company , " after all , was merely promising not to do something that the law already forbids			2
" often the same corporations violate the law again -- and make the same promise again and again			0
the @entity20 found 51 cases over the past 15 years in which 19 @entity37 firms broke anti-fraud laws they had promised not to break			1
these firms include @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			2
when faced with these multiple violations , the @entity22 simply reaches another settlement and extracts another promise , rather than bring a contempt charge in court			1
furthermore , these settlements do not even require the companies to admit to the charges brought against them			1
instead , there is a provision that lets them " neither admit nor deny " the violations , which makes them less vulnerable to investor lawsuits			1
shortly after the @entity20 article appeared , the @entity57 reported that the @entity22 agreed to collect $ 285 million as a penalty for a $ 700 million loss to investors due to fraud committed by @entity63 , and again allowed @entity63 to cop the " neither admit nor deny " clause			1
on monday , @entity17 district judge @entity65 rejected the settlement as too weak , joining others who criticized the @entity22 as toothless , saying it gives a pass to executives and allows corporations to conceal that they violated the law			1
the director of the @entity76 - winning documentary " inside job , " @entity73 , pointed out earlier this year the widespread fraud involved in the mortgage scandals			0
despite corporations having hired people to forge thousands of signatures , " not only has nobody gone to jail , but there have n't even been any criminal prosecutions			1
literally zero under the @entity88 administration			0
" when some suggested that bringing cases against high - ranking executives in the financial industry is difficult , @entity73 argued that the common use of cocaine and prostitutes on @entity37 could easily be used as " leverage			2
" however , no action has been taken			0
the main lesson about public affairs , i told my student , is in the reactions that followed the @entity20 and @entity57 revelations			0
the rest of the media paid much more mind to the latest person accusing @entity109 of sexual misconduct than to new revelations about common corporate crime and how corporations get away with it			0
the @entity115 seemed not to have noticed			0
we heard nothing from the @entity118			0
@entity120 leaders in @entity121 did not express any outrage , let alone order a new investigation			0
true , a federal judge rejected a settlement with one of these corporations , but it is far from clear what the final settlement will be			0
i told my student that such news stories tell volumes about the state of our polity : a strong @entity37 , a weak political class and an exhausted public			1
some days one can not but wonder whether one should join @entity139 , the tea party or both			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			2

it *'s* *instructive* to follow a news story and see how people respond to it , says @entity143
for example , @entity37 firms repeatedly break laws they *'ve* *pledged* not to break , he says
@entity143 : @entity22 lets these firms off with weak settlements , and they wo n't admit wrongdoing
the media and our government ignore such outrages , allowing them to continue , he says
