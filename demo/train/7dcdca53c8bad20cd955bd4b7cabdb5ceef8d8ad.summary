-- @entity1 introduced seven new safety measures over the weekend during a ceremony celebrating the delivery of the company 's new $ 665 million flagship			1
a new real - time route monitoring system , electronic tracking of guest safety training and changes that will allow more crew members to issue orders , are among the initiatives being adopted by the company in the wake of the @entity17 disaster			1
under the new rules , @entity1 cruise guests will receive emergency training before the ship leaves port and officers in uniform must be present during safety training			1
" this ensures the training has proper solemnity and gives guests an opportunity to ask any questions or express concerns they might have directly with an officer , " @entity1 said in a document outlining the new procedures			1
at least 30 people were killed when @entity17 ran aground on january 13 off the shore of the @entity39 island of @entity40			0
some survivors complained that they had not been instructed in emergency procedures			0
international regulations require that passengers receive instruction within 24 hours of departure			0
in february , three cruise industry associations announced new standards exceeding that rule by requiring muster drills before leaving port			0
under @entity1 's new rules , guests will receive an electronic card to be scanned during safety drills			1
guests who miss the initial training will be tracked electronically and invited to attend training the following day			1
guests who do not attend either session will receive written safety guidelines			2
officers will be more involved in decision making under a new bridge management model			0
" according to the new model , the captain maintains intervention power as required by law , but is no longer the only person who issues orders , " the @entity1 document said			2
the @entity17 's captain , @entity72 , remains under house arrest while he is investigated for possible criminal charges			0
he faces allegations of manslaughter , causing the shipwreck , abandoning ship and failing to report the accident			0
@entity1 will also limit access to a ship 's bridge during critical navigation phases , following a standard established by @entity85 last month , and a new monitoring system will allow @entity1 to control the position and course of all of its ships in real time			1
the cruise line 's new ship , @entity94 , was delivered in @entity95 on saturday , along with sister ship @entity96			2
@entity94 , a $ 665 million ship that can carry up to 3,800 passengers , is the largest @entity39 - flagged cruise ship afloat			0
" the delivery of the @entity94 is an important stepping stone on our @entity105 's road to recovery , " @entity1 ceo @entity101 said .			2

new @entity1 safety rules allow crew members to issue orders
guest safety training will be tracked electronically
