@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 and other countries offered to resume negotiations with @entity6 over its nuclear program on tuesday as @entity6 signaled a willingness to let international inspectors visit a key military base			1
the @entity3 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 offered to resume stalled talks in a letter from @entity20 foreign policy chief @entity19			1
she was responding to an overture that @entity6 made last month			0
the prospect of negotiations comes amid rising concern that @entity26 may attack @entity6 to disrupt its nuclear program			1
@entity26 and the @entity3 suspect @entity6 is trying to build a nuclear weapon			1
international inspectors also have voiced concern , but @entity6 insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful , civilian purposes			1
meanwhile , @entity6 offered tuesday to let international nuclear inspectors into one of its military bases , but only after significant details are worked out , its team at the @entity31 said			2
the head of the @entity31 , the @entity38 nuclear watchdog agency , said monday inspectors wanted to get into the @entity41 base as soon as possible because of evidence of ongoing activities at the base , which is suspected of being involved in testing related to nuclear weapons			1
also on monday , @entity26 prime minister @entity47 reiterated that @entity26 will remain " the master of its fate " in ensuring that @entity6 not obtain a nuclear weapon			1
" @entity26 must reserve the right to defend itself , and after all , that 's the very purpose of the jewish state : to restore to the @entity54 people control over our destiny , " @entity47 said in @entity51			0
he said time for diplomacy was running out			0
" we 've waited for sanctions to work , " he said			0
" none of us can afford to wait much longer			0
as prime minister of @entity26 , i will never let my people live in the shadow of annihilation			0
" on sunday , president @entity67 warned that " all elements of @entity3 power " remain an option to prevent @entity6 from developing nuclear weapons			2
he also emphasized that he prefers a diplomatic solution			0
@entity31 director general @entity73 declined monday to provide details on whether the activities at the @entity41 military base involve ongoing testing or efforts to remove evidence			1
" but i can tell you that we are aware that there are some activities at @entity41 and it makes us believe that going there sooner is better than later , " @entity73 said			0
@entity31 inspectors had asked to visit the facility during a february trip to @entity6 but were rebuffed , the agency and @entity6 have both said			2
@entity6 's permanent mission to the @entity38 agency said tuesday the @entity31 had been out of line to request access to @entity41 , but that once the agency formulated an appropriate request , @entity6 would let inspectors in			1
@entity6 said tuesday that the request came " in spite of " an agreement between @entity6 and the @entity31			2
" considering the fact that it is a military site , granting access is a time consuming process and can not be permitted repeatedly , " @entity6 said			0
nevertheless , it said it would allow access after the @entity31 submits paperwork about " all related issues			0
" inspectors believe @entity6 may have used @entity41 to test high explosives that could be used to detonate a nuclear weapon			1
@entity31 inspectors visited @entity41 twice in 2005 , but inspectors did not go into the building that housed the test chamber then , according to the @entity31			2
@entity6 offered access to another site late in the february visit , @entity73 said			0
but the inspection team in @entity6 was not outfitted to examine @entity117 , a site the @entity31 believes may have been used to test elements of a nuclear weapon in 2003			1
@entity6 has said its nuclear program is entirely peaceful , but @entity73 said @entity6 's failure to cooperate with international inspectors makes it impossible to be sure			1
in fact , the agency " continues to have serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions " of @entity6 's nuclear program , @entity73 said			1
because @entity6 is not following an agreement to provide expanded information and broader access to international inspectors , the agency is " unable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in @entity6 , and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in @entity6 is in peaceful activities , " he said in a statement preceding his news conference			2
he added that the concern stems from " overall credible information that indicates that @entity6 engaged in activities relevant to the development of nuclear explosive devices			0
" @entity31 inspectors traveled to @entity6 in january and again in february to discuss the issue , but failed to reach an agreement , @entity73 said			2
monday 's statement by @entity73 is not the first time the agency has questioned the purposes behind @entity6 's nuclear program			1
most recently , after the february visit by inspectors , the agency issued a report announcing that @entity6 had stepped up its efforts to produce enriched uranium in violation of international resolutions calling on it to stop			0
the agency expressed " serious concerns " about potential military uses by @entity6 in that report			0
among other things , @entity6 has tripled its monthly production of uranium enriched to contain a 20 % concentration of radioactive material and taken other steps to ramp up its nuclear program , @entity73 said monday			2
while @entity6 has said the higher - level enrichment is meant to produce therapies for cancer patients and other peaceful purposes , international critics have called the efforts a troubling step toward possible militarization of nuclear technology			0
nuclear weapons require concentrations of about 90 %			0
@entity73 said the agency would continue discussions with @entity6 and urged the country to abide by @entity31 and @entity38 resolutions on its nuclear program			1
@entity6 is under increasing international pressure regarding its nuclear program			2
the @entity38 , the @entity3 , the @entity20 and other countries have imposed sanctions related to @entity6 's nuclear research , and speculation regarding a possible military strike on @entity6 nuclear facilities has been rampant in recent months			1
@entity2 's @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
