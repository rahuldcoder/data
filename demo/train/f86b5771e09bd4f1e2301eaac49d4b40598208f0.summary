@entity1 , @entity0 -- they are the tales of two very different people			0
director @entity6 's film " @entity7 " shines a stark light on poverty in @entity10			1
one an amoral businessman pouring out his life story to the @entity13 , the other a lovelorn teenager appearing on " @entity18 , " the @entity10 version of " @entity17 ? " but if their protagonists are polar opposites , both stories -- one as told in @entity27 's best - selling novel " the @entity28 , " the other in " @entity7 , " the new movie from " @entity22 " director @entity6 -- have much in common			1
both are based in modern day @entity10 , both feature characters who succeed against all the odds , and both have garnered considerable critical acclaim , with " @entity7 " recently awarded the three top prizes at the @entity38 @entity37			1
" @entity7 , " which is set in @entity43 , has also assumed a particularly poignant resonance in light of the recent terror attacks that left 174 people dead			2
above all , both narratives shine a stark light on poverty -- an aspect of @entity10 society that has increasingly been pushed into the background by a decade and more of upbeat headlines about the country 's dramatic economic growth			1
" the growth aspect has tended to receive much more attention than the darker side of the @entity10 story , " professor @entity53 , @entity54 of @entity55 , told @entity2 , " more and more the poverty goes unnoticed , and there is less and less of a voice for the excluded peoples			2
" the breadth of the divide between what @entity27 calls the " @entity67 , " and the " @entity68 , " is both dramatic and shocking			0
since 1991 when " neo-liberal " market reforms were introduced , @entity10 's economy has ballooned			1
from 1991 to 2004 , the world 's largest democracy grew at 6.5 percent annually , a figure which increased to over 9 percent between 2005 and 2007			2
the result has been a massive explosion of wealth creation among the middle and upper echelons of @entity10 society , with @entity10 billionaires now occupying four of the top eight slots on the annual @entity82 rich list			1
while growth has benefited one section of society , it has left a vast swathe of the population lagging far behind			2
" people in urban areas , the rich , the middle classes , the educated -- all of these have benefited from economic growth , " dr @entity88 of @entity89 , a sustainable development organization based in @entity91 , told @entity2 , " those who have not benefited are the small farmers , the rural poor , the artisans -- for these their situation has worsened			2
" @entity99 , ceo of @entity100 , agrees			1
" economic growth has been primarily focused on manufacturing and services and largely in urban areas , " she told @entity2 , " rural agriculture has not received the kind of attention it deserves			0
and since the bulk of poor people derive their incomes from agriculture , that has left us with two @entity110 , one rich , one impoverished			1
" even a cursory glance at the statistics reveals a problem on a huge scale			0
according to @entity118 estimates , 456 million people -- just over 40 percent of @entity10 's population of 1.2 billion -- now live on less than $ 1.25 per day , a sum recognized as the international poverty line			1
almost half of @entity10 's children are malnourished ; 1000 die every day from diarrhea ; hundreds of millions have no access to proper sanitation			1
these figures provide a grim counterpoint to the glitzy high - rises and designer shopping malls that have sprung up throughout the country 's major cities			2
how to narrow this gulf between the haves and the have - nots is a fiendishly complex issue and one that has no quick or easy solutions			0
more investment in basic infrastructure is seen as crucial , as is a reform of international trade agreements			0
" import and energy prices have increased for farmers , but global markets are not opening up for @entity10 agricultural products , " @entity99 told @entity2 , " that needs to change			1
" greater access to institutional finance , the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities , and the spread of information technology all have a major role to play			0
" we already have small pockets of improvement , " says @entity88 , " but these involve limited numbers in limited geographies			0
" we need to scale everything up			0
it is a huge challenge			0
" the global economic problems have not bypassed @entity10			1
inflation is now running close to 12 percent and the @entity167 has almost halved in value from a peak in january 2008			0
@entity170 -- the @entity171 -- has not registered any significant drop as a result of the recent @entity43 attacks , and it remains to be seen what the longer term effect will be on the @entity10 economy			2
nonetheless , these difficult and uncertain times may make the challenge of poverty reduction an even harder one			0
will @entity10 be able to successfully reduce the gap between rich and poor ? leave your comments in the @entity185 box below both @entity88 and @entity99 remain hopeful that change is coming to @entity10 , albeit slowly			1
" we are eternal optimists , " says @entity88 , " i do believe things are changing			0
" " the government recognizes that people do n't just want a high level of growth , " adds @entity99 , " but also growth that is more equalizing			2
we need to bring the two @entity195 together , and i believe we can do it			0
" despite their optimism , the problems remain vast , and the darkness intense			0
for the foreseeable future it seems likely the question most on the minds of @entity10 's 456 million poor will be less " who wants to be a millionaire ? " than " will i be able to feed myself and my family today ? "			1

@entity6 's " @entity7 " shines a light on slum - *dwellers* in @entity10
huge growth means four of top eight billionaires on @entity82 rich list are @entity10
but the new wealth has bypassed @entity10 's 456 million poor
@entity99 of @entity100 says there are : " two @entity110 , one rich , one impoverished "
