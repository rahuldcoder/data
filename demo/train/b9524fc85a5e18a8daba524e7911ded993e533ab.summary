-- should college athletes at least be paid the same minimum wage as the students who usher at their games or sell refreshments to fans ? a former @entity8 soccer player thinks so , and is suing hundreds of @entity10 universities and the @entity11 , comparing collegiate athletics to work - study programs and seeking to get minimum wage payment for athletes			1
it 's just the latest of a handful of pay - for - play lawsuits now before federal courts			1
" work - study participants who sell programs or usher at athletic events are paid , on average , $ 9.03 an hour , " states the lawsuit , filed in federal court in @entity21			1
" but student athletes whose performance creates such student jobs in the athletic department are paid nothing			2
" @entity30 , who played for the @entity8 from 2010 to 2014 , filed the suit and claims she is owed back pay under the @entity32 for the time she was " employed " as " an unpaid student athlete			1
" students in work - study programs , her lawsuit says , are considered part - time employees who must be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour			1
but athletes are n't afforded that pay			0
instead , because of @entity11 rules , their benefits are capped at the cost of a scholarship			0
@entity46 ' lawsuit points out that students in work - study programs are routinely paid for their work			1
for example , the lawsuit says , on average , a wage of $ 10.44 is paid to students who provide tours on campus , $ 11.25 for food concession and counter attendants , and $ 14.11 for building and grounds cleaning			1
" the ( d ) efendants have jointly agreed , and conspired , to deprive student athletes of lawfully earned , modest wages and of equal treatment under law , " wrote @entity58 attorney @entity57			0
the @entity11 responded by saying it is " evaluating the complaint , but disagree [ s ] that student - athletes are participating in athletics as employees			2
student - athletes have a passion for their sport and a commitment to their teammates that ca n't be equated to punching a time clock			2
" @entity30 is the latest athlete to sue the @entity11 over pay - for - play issues			1
her suit mirrors some of the issues raised by @entity79 football players who took their school to labor court to establish that they were employees of the university with the right to unionize and make demands			0
a judge with the @entity86 agreed that they were employees after hearing testimony about the tight controls kept on student athletes and the emphasis on sport over academics			0
that ruling is being appealed by @entity79			0
" student athletes perform longer , more rigorous hours -- nearer full time , " @entity46 ' lawsuit reads			2
they are " subject to stricter , more exacting supervision " and " confer as many , if not more , tangible and intangible benefits on @entity98			0
" @entity46 ' suit might also be helped by another legal victory for student athletes : the recent federal court verdict in favor of former @entity104 player @entity103 , who sued the @entity11 over the use of his likeness and image			2
a judge in that case ruled that the @entity11 's ban on paying players is a violation of anti-trust law and as a result , starting in 2016 , schools can choose to pay athletes up to $ 5,000 per year for the use of their images			0
another set of litigation is pending before the federal courts that seeks to eliminate the pay cap on college athletes , and make college sports more like the pros			1
the @entity11 is fighting that suit , too			0
@entity57 said @entity30 , who is still a student and busy with classes and preparing for grad school , was n't available to talk about her lawsuit .			0

university of @entity8 student notes those who work at games are paid
she says students who are playing the games should get paid , too
