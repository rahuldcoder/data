-- if you are noticing as you travel that more fellow travelers are @entity3 , you are not wrong in your observation			1
it is estimated that almost 100 million @entity3 traveled out of @entity3 in 2013 with this number expected to reach 200 million by 2018			2
these staggering figures can be attributed to @entity3 's growing middle class , more annual leave , easier visa applications to more countries and increased air travel routes to overseas destinations			1
today the @entity14 is the top destination for @entity3 travelers , followed by several @entity18 destinations , with @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 also featuring high on the list			1
as the @entity3 take more trips overseas , their booking methods , preference for group size and the types of experiences they desire are also shifting rapidly			2
@entity3 now has more than 618 million internet users , about 80 % of whom access the web via their smartphones			2
so it is not surprising that the technology - savvy @entity3 are increasingly booking more travel online			0
guided tours remain popular , but group sizes are shrinking and more are opting for individual travel , with the younger generation gradually choosing " adventure " travel			0
shopping is still a priority for @entity3 travelers , and this is evident as the item most often left behind in rooms occupied by @entity3 guests are old pieces of luggage , presumably because they have upgraded to newer and branded ones to accommodate shopping items			1
however , " seeing the world " and " experiencing life " are growing aspirations as they explore new lands			0
based on these trends and developments , the travel and hospitality trade must recognize that a fuller , more nuanced understanding of the cultural and social backgrounds of @entity3 travelers , as well as the operational aspects of dealing with the rise of @entity3 tourism , is not only fundamental , but absolutely necessary across the sector			1
from the perspective of a leading global hospitality company providing a " home away from home " for travelers , we have to be even more attuned to the unique qualities of each nationality , @entity3 travelers included			1
in 2011 , recognizing @entity3 's rising outbound tourism , we launched a program called @entity77 , " which means " welcome " in @entity3			1
hotels in our portfolio in the @entity77 program offer @entity3 - speaking front office staff , amenities such as teapots and slippers in guest rooms , @entity3 - language tv channels and a range of traditional @entity3 dishes such as congee , noodles and dim sum on the breakfast buffet			0
while we believe these are steps in the right direction , we are also aware that a lot more can be done to understand and court this fast - growing demographic			0
as much as the @entity3 seek distinct experiences as they travel , we too must recognize that practices such as tipping and queuing are not as common in @entity3 culture			0
and therein lies an opportunity for us as a hospitality company to play an active role in the educational process			0
for instance , @entity3 guests staying at our @entity108 resort are fascinated with the coral formations around the resort , and sometimes try to bring a piece back as a souvenir			0
our resort team members receive cultural training that enables them to then educate their @entity3 guests on the length of time coral takes to form and the fragility of the formations , and hence the importance of leaving them in their natural state			2
to put things into context , there was a comparable phenomenon years ago when other nationalities such as @entity14 and @entity128 embarked on international travel , and went through similar " growing pains			0
" however , the sheer size of @entity3 's population is such that when even 1 % of the population travels , that is a huge number of people and as such their traits and behaviors are amplified , and inevitably more obvious			1
ultimately though , it is a receptiveness to understand , coupled with mutual respect that endear people to learn from one another			0
we also firmly believe that to win the hearts and minds of the @entity3 outbound traveler , we first need to build up strong brand equity within @entity3 itself			2
being familiar with what a brand has to offer provides a level of trust and comfort to @entity3 travelers as they venture further and further afield			1
i will not deny that the sheer size of @entity3 's outbound tourism numbers , combined with the speed at which travelers ' tastes are changing , make it challenging for those in the travel or hospitality trade to adapt at an equal if not faster pace			1
but frankly , to not do so is at the peril of your business .			0

@entity167 : more and more @entity3 are traveling around the world
a more nuanced understanding of the cultural and social backgrounds of @entity3 travelers is needed
@entity3 's large outbound tourism numbers make it challenging for *industry* to adapt at equal pace
