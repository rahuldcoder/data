@entity0 -- @entity2 survived what officials warned could have been a traffic nightmare this weekend when a section of one of the nation 's busiest freeways , closed for construction , was reopened ahead of schedule sunday			1
" @entity17 , shmarmageddon , " said @entity13 @entity12 , as he and @entity0 mayor @entity14 announced at midday sunday that @entity15 would reopen 17 hours before monday 's morning rush hour begins			1
despite @entity0 ' reputation as " the car capital of the @entity25 , the congestion capital , the city most addicted to the single - passenger automobile , " motorists found alternatives to driving for the weekend , mayor @entity14 said			1
a 10 - mile segment of the freeway was closed friday night to allow crews to demolish a section of bridge to make way for a car pool lane			2
workers completed the demolition faster than expected , mayor @entity14 said sunday morning			1
" the fact that we were able to do it sooner meant that things went very , very smoothly , " @entity14 said sunday			2
" had they not , we might have had this press conference on monday afternoon			0
" barriers that had detoured northbound and southbound traffic away from the 405 since late friday were removed at noon sunday , with the opening of interchanges and ramps to follow			0
the real story may be how @entity0 residents reacted to dire warnings to keep their cars parked or else get struck in predicted gridlock that @entity12 had dubbed @entity52			1
the number of cars driving on @entity0 roads dropped a dramatic two - thirds saturday , @entity12 said			1
" i propose a yearly carmageddon holiday ! what a lovely chill summer day in @entity60 , " resident @entity57 said in a @entity58 posting saturday afternoon			0
@entity12 and @entity14 both agreed sunday , sounding as if they were only half - joking			1
" i like the idea of us taking a time out once a year , " @entity14 said			2
" i think everybody has realized that we can get out of our car once in a while and survive			2
" the mayor said he was pleased with reports of " people going to their neighborhood restaurants , going to a coffee shops , talking with neighbors , having family dinners or barbecues that they might not otherwise have done in the rat race that we live in			0
" in fact , the city will do it again in 11 months when the second half of the @entity83 bridge is demolished to complete the expansion project			0
while fear of gridlock motivated the change in habits this time , @entity12 suggested @entity0 residents may have learned an unexpected lesson			1
" i think a lot of people in @entity0 have learned that you can get along without taking long rides in your cars on weekends these past couple of days , " he said			2
" there 's a feeling in @entity0 that if you do n't get in your car on a weekend that you 're somehow being cheated of something			1
" demolition of a section of the southern half of the @entity83 bridge , necessary to make room for a northbound car pool lane , was expected to keep the freeway closed for 53 hours , ending at 5 a.m. monday , the start of the morning rush hour			2
crews closed ramps late friday on the 405 , where it passes over the @entity116 , @entity111 officials said			0
the $ 1.2 billion construction project calls for replacing a portion of a bridge at @entity83 , a mountain summit road that is featured in many @entity123 films , authorities said			0
a year from now , crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the @entity83 bridge , officials said			0
the project also calls for adding a car - pool lane in each direction , creating " the largest hov system in the world " at 48.6 miles in length between the @entity133 and @entity134 , said @entity135 , the @entity111 's director for @entity0 and @entity138 counties			1
the two - year project will replace two more bridges , also to accommodate the widening of the 405 , and will improve about two dozen on - off ramps and add 18 miles of sound - deadening walls for nearby residents , @entity135 said			0
the 405 is usually one of the busiest freeways in the country , carrying about 500,000 cars a day through the @entity149 , a critical artery connecting @entity151 along the coast			0
the 405 achieved notoriety on national television as the corridor that former @entity157 player @entity156 used as he was being slowly chased by police in 1994			0
the highway also cuts through the west side of @entity0 , an area that includes the high - status communities of @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity60			1
