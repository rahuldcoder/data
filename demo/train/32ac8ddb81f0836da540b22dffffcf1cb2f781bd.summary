@entity0 , @entity1 -- for three days , @entity3 has been a crime scene			2
on friday , it will be a shopping mall , once again			2
yet the @entity1 shopping center 's scheduled 9 a.m. reopening -- announced on its @entity9 page -- does not close the books on the many questions tied to tuesday 's fatal shooting			1
investigators have identified @entity14 , 22 , as the man responsible for the bloodshed and panic at the mall , located in the community of @entity0 , about 10 miles southeast of @entity20			1
remembering the victims wearing a load - bearing vest and hockey mask , @entity22 used a semi-automatic rifle to shoot three people on the mall 's second floor , killing two of them , according to authorities			1
he then ran down a corridor and back hallway that led downstairs			2
it was there , police say , that @entity22 took his own life with a gunshot to the head			1
the one shooting victim who did n't die of her injuries , @entity39 , remained in @entity41 on thursday			1
the 15 - year - old suffered a collapsed right lung and injuries to her liver after being shot in the chest , dr. @entity42 told reporters wednesday			2
she was in serious condition thursday , as she had been the day before , said @entity51 , a spokesman for the @entity20 hospital			2
authorities have n't offered more insights publicly , meanwhile , into the man they say shot @entity39 , 54 - year - old @entity56 and 45 - year - old @entity55			1
@entity56 died of a single shot to the back , and @entity55 of one shot to his head , @entity1 deputy medical examiner @entity59 said thursday in a news release			1
no motive has been given to explain why @entity22 did what he did			1
on his @entity9 page , @entity22 describes himself as a " pretty funny person that takes sarcasm to the max. " the central image is a " @entity75 " slogan painted on a wall and stamped " cancelled " in red -- a work by famed street artist @entity74			1
the woman who raised @entity22 after his mother died of cancer when he was 2 described him as " fun and caring " and a " totally cool dude			1
" choking back tears , she called tuesday 's shooting " completely out of character " and apologized for the pain and panic @entity22 had caused			1
" never could i imagine him being part of something like this , " @entity87 , his biological aunt -- though she referred to herself as his mother -- told @entity2 affiliate @entity88			0
" what @entity92 did was wrong but , as his mother , he will always be in my heart			0
i love him very much			0
" the woman described the suspected gunman as fun - loving and adventurous while growing up			2
@entity22 planned to " be a hero " and join the @entity98 , @entity87 said			1
but that dream was dashed when he broke his foot at age 17 , and " he lost purpose			0
" the two had n't spoken in about four years , after they had a " falling out ... because he did n't want to get up and look for a job ... and he got really depressed and he got really angry			0
" after that , @entity87 said she thought of him daily and still loved him deeply -- even though she ca n't explain his actions			0
" every day of my whole life , i was proud of him , " she said			0
" i 'm just not proud of him right now			0
" staffers at @entity110 , where @entity22 helped out in the school 's counseling department before his graduation , are trying to come to grips with what happened			1
" i found him to be a very polite young man , soft - spoken , nice smile , " said @entity116 , a counseling department staffer			2
" and i 'm just really surprised that somebody with his personality would end up doing something like this			0
" the @entity122 is offering " to help pay for at least 10 counseling sessions " for those rattled by tuesday 's shooting			1
in its post announcing stores will reopen friday , @entity3 stressed it wo n't forget all those affected by the violence -- from @entity56 , @entity55 and @entity39 to the scores of others who saw their holiday shopping devolve into chaos			0
a candlelight vigil is planned for 7 p.m. friday at a mall entrance			0
" please continue to keep the victims , their families and the entire community in your prayers during this difficult time , " the mall said			0
