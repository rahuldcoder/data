@entity0 , @entity1 -- chemical dispersants keep flowing into the @entity4 at virtually unchanged levels despite the @entity7 's order to @entity8 to " significantly " scale back , according to a @entity2 analysis of daily dispersant reports provided by the @entity12			1
when the may 26 directive was issued , @entity7 administrator @entity13 said dispersant use should be cut by 75 percent			1
public statements at the time made by the @entity7 administrator gave the impression that federal officials were trying to cut down overall dispersant use			1
" we expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used , " @entity22 said in may			0
before may 26 , @entity8 used 25,689 gallons a day of the chemical dispersant @entity27			2
since then , @entity2 's analysis shows , the daily average of dispersant use has dropped to 23,250 gallons a day , a 9 percent decline			1
@entity34 environmentalists say it 's another sign that the federal agencies monitoring dispersant use are not being tough enough with @entity8			0
" i think the @entity7 has been struggling to respond to this crisis , " said @entity38 with the @entity39			0
" it 's all really a giant science experiment and we 're terribly concerned that in the long run the impacts are going to be significant and we really do n't know what we 're doing to the ecosystem			1
" but the @entity7 argues it deserves credit for getting alarming dispersant use under control			2
the directive states that @entity8 must ramp down dispersant use by " 75 percent from the maximum daily amount used			1
" and that 's the catch			0
the highest recorded amount of dispersant used occurred on may 23 , when 70,000 gallons were injected into the @entity4			0
@entity7 officials say they feared that number would have become the norm and that 's why , they say , the directive was issued			2
" this escalation was quickly reversed , ensuring @entity8 only uses the lowest volume of dispersant needed , " said @entity62 , a spokeswoman for the @entity7			2
but even by the @entity7 's own standards , @entity8 still routinely exceeds the daily threshold			0
the @entity7 and @entity68 say they 're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day			1
but according to @entity2 's analysis , @entity8 has gone over that amount 50 percent of the time since the may 26 directive was issued			1
to do so , @entity8 must request permission from the @entity68			0
@entity68 officials say dispersant use is " evaluated daily " and that it 's using the " safest and most effective methods available " to protect the sea environment			0
" the @entity7 - @entity68 directive has been successful in ensuring that @entity8 uses the lowest volume of dispersant necessary , " @entity68 lt. @entity82 , a spokesman with the @entity12			1
the @entity7 continues testing the chemical dispersant @entity27 , which has been used by @entity8 since the beginning of the oil disaster			1
so far more than 1.6 million gallons of the chemical have been injected into the @entity4			0
but the struggle over daily dispersant use has caught the eye of rep. @entity90 , @entity91 , one of the loudest critics of @entity8 's response in cleaning up the oil spill			0
" i think it is obvious we can never again allow for a repetition of what is happening right now , where the science experiment is being conducted without having any idea what the impact on marine life long term will be , " said @entity90 .			2
