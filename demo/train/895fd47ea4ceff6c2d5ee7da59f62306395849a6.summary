@entity0 -- energy giant @entity3 has found the source of a gas leak on an offshore oil platform in the @entity7 , the company told @entity1 on thursday			1
the leak is on the deck level of the well head platform , @entity3 said			1
the @entity12 platform sprang a leak sunday , forcing the evacuation of the rig			1
experts are working to decide whether they can wait for the gas to stop leaking on its own , or whether the company must drill a relief well or fill it with mud in a " kill operation , " @entity3 said			1
nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed sunday , @entity3 has said			1
the leak seems to have started as workers were sealing the well in the @entity7 , about 150 miles ( 240 kilometers ) east of the @entity30 city of @entity31			1
" ironically , it sounds as if , just like with the @entity34 , they were closing off a well and somewhere along the line something went wrong , " oceanographer @entity36 said , referring to the major @entity38 oil spill in the @entity39 in 2010			0
the @entity12 leak has echoes of the @entity38 spill , but there are differences			1
the @entity12 is in shallower water , which could make problems easier to fix , but it is leaking gas , rather than oil			2
" this is nothing on the scale of the @entity39 spill two years ago , " @entity36 said			0
" this is a relatively light spill			0
the gas itself is dispersing quite rapidly			0
" " the hope is that there is so little gas pressure in there that it will just blow itself out , " he said of the @entity12 spill			2
@entity3 's share price was down about 2 % in trading in @entity63 on thursday afternoon			2
the @entity63 company 's share price fell 7 % tuesday on news of the leak , but market analyst firm @entity68 said wednesday that it thought the market had overreacted			2
a union representing workers on the rig warned wednesday that there was an " urgent need " to stop the leak			1
" if the gas cloud somehow finds an ignition source , we could be looking at complete destruction , " said @entity76 , an official with the @entity77			0
" this is an unprecedented situation , and we really are in the realms of the unknown , " he said			0
but oceanographer @entity36 said the risk of explosion may not be as high as initially feared			2
" initially , the risk of explosion was seen as being very high			0
there were reports coming through of a large gas cloud enveloping the whole rig , " he told @entity1			0
but the fact that there has been no blast when the flare on the gas rig is still burning " obviously contradicts the idea that there was a very high risk of explosion , " he said			2
" perhaps the quantity of gas is not that great as first thought , " he said			0
for the moment , the wind seems to be blowing the gas cloud away from the flare on the @entity12 rig			1
the winds over the @entity7 around the @entity110 platform are predicted to remain strong ( 40 - 50 kph , with gusts over 60 kph ) and out of the northwest through friday			1
on saturday , the winds are expected to shift slightly out of the north , as an area of high pressure drifts eastward over the @entity116 , and they should weaken sunday			0
scattered light showers are possible friday and saturday , but the area should stay mostly dry through the weekend			0
@entity3 said there was a " sheen on the water in the vicinity of the platform , " but said tuesday there was no indication of environmental damage and there had been no injuries			1
@entity130 partially evacuated two of its nearby platforms , @entity131 and @entity133 , as a " purely precautionary " measure , it said wednesday			0
the @entity7 was the scene of the world 's worst offshore rig disaster , the @entity139 explosion , which killed 167 people in 1988			1
@entity1 's @entity141 and @entity142 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity12 platform leak is not *underwater* , energy firm @entity3 says
@entity3 evacuated the rig in the @entity7 after the leak sunday
experts are deciding whether leak will stop on its own , or if action is needed
initial fears of an explosion may be *unfounded* , an oceanographer says
