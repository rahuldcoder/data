-- world governing body @entity1 has had just two presidents in 40 years and current incumbent @entity3 has given his strongest indication yet that he wants to extend that record further			1
the @entity6 has been in charge since 1998 , when @entity9 @entity8 ended his 24 - year reign			1
prior to being elected unopposed for a fourth term in 2011 , @entity3 -- who turns 78 next month -- said he would stand down in 2015			1
yet an interview with @entity6 radio on friday shows that he has had a change of heart ahead of next year 's elections			2
" if i have the health -- and currently i am in good health -- i do n't see why i should stop the work , " @entity3 told the public station @entity19			0
many people say it needs to be continued			0
" " i will not shout ' i 'm a candidate ' but if the member associations ask me , i will not say no. " as with any potential candidate , @entity3 -- who started working for @entity1 as a technical director in 1975 -- needs the support of five national associations to be eligible to stand for election			1
he has previously spoken of a desire to fulfill his mission , as he looks to secure his legacy			0
widely criticized for controversial comments about racism and @entity1 's handling of the bidding process to stage both the 2018 and 2022 @entity37 , @entity3 will point to having taken the tournament to @entity39 in 2010 and to the @entity40 in eight years ' time as among his greatest successes			1
so far , only @entity3 's former aide @entity43 has thrown his hat into the ring for the elections in june 2015			0
the @entity47 , who served as @entity1 's deputy secretary general between 2002 and 2005 , announced his candidature in @entity50 last month			0
at the time , he said he was not sure he could beat @entity51 should his former boss decide to run but @entity43 refused to comment when contacted by @entity0 on friday			0
@entity55 president @entity54 , a former @entity47 international , has also been widely tipped to run for office but a man who @entity3 described in 2012 as " ready " to succeed him has yet to reveal his hand			2
@entity1 followers speculated last october about whether @entity3 was set to stand again after he said that both @entity39 and @entity60 deserved more representation at the 32 - team @entity62			1
" it can not be that the @entity65 and @entity66 confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the @entity62 ( 18 or 19 teams ) , because taken together they account for significantly fewer member associations ( 63 ) than @entity39 and @entity60 ( 100 ) , " he wrote			2
with each of @entity1 's 209 member associations holding one vote , such comments were construed by some as a bid to curry favor with two sizable voting blocs			1
they came in the same month as @entity80 , the head of the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) , ruled himself out of contention for football 's most important job			0
@entity3 , who will be 78 in march , was elected unopposed for a fourth term in 2011 after his rival @entity86 withdrew his candidacy after being accused of attempting to buy votes -- a charge he was later cleared of			2
he is only the eighth president in the history of @entity1 , an organization that was founded in 1904 .			0

@entity1 president @entity3 says he is prepared to bid for a fifth term
*77* - year - old will stand for *re-election* if backed by member associations
@entity6 has been in charge of @entity1 since 1998
