the world saw another side of @entity3 mountaineering in april last year when a brawl was reported between @entity6 climbers and @entity7 22,000 feet up @entity8			1
now @entity3 authorities plan to station security officials at the base of the world 's highest peak from the spring climbing season beginning in march			2
up to nine officers from the police and army will be sent to the mountain to try to resolve conflicts on the spot rather than having to appeal to authorities in @entity20			1
" the police will be the state 's representative at the mountain to verify incidents that have to be reported to the authorities , " said @entity21 , a mountaineering official			0
" it 's [ part of ] our effort to make mountaineering respectable			0
" @entity8 : by the numbers confrontation with sherpas the @entity34 mountaineer @entity33 and the @entity36 @entity35 were ascending @entity8 by a new route last april when they were reportedly confronted by a group of sherpas laying ropes for other climbers who accused them of getting in the way			1
the @entity6 said the @entity7 threatened and then attacked them , including throwing rocks			2
the @entity7 said the climbers had caused ice to drop on them and had ignored requests not to advance until the ropes had been laid			0
the issue was resolved after a meeting mediated by a @entity3 army official leading an expedition			0
with police at base camp , @entity3 liaison officers -- who accompany expeditions to ensure they abide by local laws -- will no longer have to report incidents at the nearest police station a seven - day trek away , said @entity62 , who has worked as such an officer			0
beginning this year , the @entity3 government will also have a secretariat headed by a civilian at @entity67 , to which security officials will report			2

@entity8 men : on top of the world in 1963 mountain traffic jams while the quarrel between mountaineers and sherpas made headlines in 2013 , @entity3 authorities came under fire in 2012 for allowing " traffic jams " to build up on the mountain , allegedly contributing to accidents			1
there have been calls to restrict climbing permits to expert mountaineers , preventing novices from attempting the peak			0
" we are looking into the basis for setting [ the ] criteria [ for climbing ] , " @entity21 said			0
for the past several years , around 300 foreign climbers have attempted to ascend @entity8 each spring			1
to further regulate traffic , beginning this year the government has revised its royalty fees for climbing the mountain			1
last year the fee went down from $ 25,000 per climber to $ 10,000 if there were more than seven in a team			2
the result was that climbers who did n't know each other clubbed together in " artificial " teams to pay significantly lower royalties			0
but under new regulations , each foreign climber will pay a flat rate of $ 11,000 irrespective of the number of climbers			1
