@entity0 , @entity1 -- decades navigating the roads in @entity1 have left deep scars on @entity6 ' jet black 1947 @entity8 motorcycle			1
the @entity8 's frame is a battlefield of craters and gashes			1
the frozen odometer stopped counting at 45,000 kilometers			0
in @entity1 , where little is in abundance save shortages , @entity14 uses a car wheel for his motorcycle 's back tire			1
but when @entity14 kick - starts the @entity8 , its engine roars to full - throated life			1
@entity14 is a " harlista , " what @entity1 call the small band of men and women who have preserved the island 's motorcycle culture			1
that has n't been an easy task in a country where a five - decades - old @entity35 economic embargo makes getting new parts -- much less bikes -- near impossible			0
you have to have spirit , desire , " @entity14 said			0
" there 's nowhere to buy spare parts here so over the years we have had to find alternative fixes or invent our own			0
" and being a @entity8 fanatic courted controversy in the early years of the @entity1 revolution when everything @entity35 , from jazz music to rock ' n ' roll , was considered suspect			1
it also did n't help that @entity8 were the motorcycle of choice for police during the @entity59 dictatorship			1
but now the iconic @entity35 bikes are enjoying something of a comeback			1
over the weekend , @entity14 was one of about 50 harlistas to participate in @entity1 's first ever nationwide @entity8 rally in the beach resort town of @entity0			1
" it 's an opportunity for us to celebrate not just the @entity8 but the @entity68 , " @entity14 said			1
" and in one of the prettiest places with the best beaches in the country			0
" the sight of the motley crew of black leather - sporting motorcyclists pulling into a seaside town seemed like a scene straight out of the classic @entity82 film " @entity80 , " where a band of bikers terrorize a small community			0
but in @entity0 it was the bikers who were beset upon by admiring locals and tourists			1
one family of @entity35 tourists said they had changed their travel plans to come from @entity93 to @entity1 for a few days after learning about the event			2
" we are here to give these guys a hand ; it 's lot of work to keep their bikes running , " said event organizer @entity95			0
@entity8 aficionados are unique , @entity95 said , because their vintage bikes are not just for show			2
" a lot of the people use them in their everyday life to get around , " @entity95 said			0
" for some people here , it 's their only form of transportation			0
" the bikes lined up at the @entity0 rally were a mix of @entity8 from the decades leading up to @entity1 's 1959 revolution			1
some @entity8 were adorned with the face of revolutionary icon @entity118 , others with @entity35 eagles			2
in between demonstrating their agility in biking competitions , the harlistas checked out one another 's rides and explained to tourists how they keep them running			2
even with foreigners bringing in replacement parts from the outside , keeping the @entity8 running is no small feat. many of the bikes used parts cannibalized from @entity135 and old @entity134 bikes and cars			2
some @entity137 are legendary in the community for hand - making the parts they need			0
but however challenging , none of the @entity8 fanatics says they plan to abandon their passion any time soon			2
" you get to a point where the @entity8 becomes part of your family , " @entity8 owner @entity143 said			0
if you sold it , you 'd never find another bike like it			0

those who have preserved @entity1 's motorcycle culture are called " harlistas "

@entity1 's first ever nationwide @entity8 rally was held *recently* in @entity0
