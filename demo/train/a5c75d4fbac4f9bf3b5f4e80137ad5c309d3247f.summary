-- actor @entity1 wishes he could trace his family 's @entity3 history back 100,000 years , but he 'll have to settle for 1930 for now			1
in what one online genealogy firm say is an extraordinary trove of data for @entity11 families of @entity13 descent , the complete 1930 @entity3 census is being distributed publicly for the first time			1
it 's considered a rich mine of information because that year 's census is @entity3 's earliest , most accurate accounting of its population , with 90 % of its people counted , according to the firm @entity22			1
that sort of family lore -- compiled just after @entity3 recovered from its tumultuous , bloody revolution of 1910 - 20 -- not only piques the interest of prominent latinos such as @entity1 but also stands to sate the curiosity of 31.9 million @entity11 @entity13 of @entity3 descent			1
@entity11 's own 2010 census just elevated @entity27 to the no. 2 group for the first time			2
the 1930 @entity3 census is so antique that it consists of nearly 13 million hard - copy pages , with rows and columns filled out by hand in florid penmanship			1
the handwriting evokes a bygone era dramatically at odds with the digital age that is making those documents available for free on @entity22			0
other genealogy firms have put pieces of the census online , but @entity22 says it 's providing the entire 1930 census online for the first time , spokesman @entity43 said			1
" this is the most important document we have for @entity3 - @entity11 people in this country , " @entity1 said in an interview with @entity0			1
the @entity54 - nominated actor is working with the online firm to trace his family 's @entity3 history			1
like the waves of @entity60 immigrants before them , many @entity27 have only oral histories of their origins , @entity1 said			0
the 31.8 million @entity11 of @entity3 descent account for most of the country 's 50.5 million hispanics , according to the @entity67			1
" short of the verbal history that went from person to person , family to family , we really never knew more than that , " @entity1 said			0
" this is the first time we 've had a document			0
" for me , it 's building my self - esteem and self - respect as to who i am and for the people who sacrificed for me to be where i am			0
now i know who they are and what are their names			0
now you want to know more about those people			0
i would like to go back 100,000 years if i could , " @entity1 said			0
@entity3 's 1895 census is considered the country 's first national census , but those records are n't available to the public and are n't considered as complete as the 1930 census , said representatives for @entity22 , which claims to be the largest online family history resource			1
the 1900 , 1910 and 1920 censuses are n't regarded as complete and reliable as the 1930 census -- officially called " @entity99 1930 , @entity3 , " or the fifth general census of population and housing , according to @entity22 's representatives			1
the 1930 census does n't include citizens from the federal district , which includes @entity104 , but it 's historically significant because it marks how federal officials sought to make it a vehicle for national unity , said officials with the online firm			1
an " aggressive propaganda campaign " emphasizing the civic duty to participate in the census resulted in the " extremely high participation rate , " and that 's why the 1930 count is considered the best @entity3 census of the 20th century , the online firm said			1
the records list the names of persons in a household and contain many fields of information : name , age , gender , birthplace , address , marital status , nationality , religion , occupation , real estate holdings , literacy , any physical or mental defects and even any @entity137 language spoken			0
@entity22 says the 13 million records reveal several facets about @entity3 in 1930 : the most common female name was @entity141 , and the most common male name was @entity143			2
the three most common surnames were @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
famous @entity3 in the census include @entity152 ( 1914 -- 2002 ) , who was among the best - known @entity3 actresses , and @entity154 ( @entity156 del @entity155 ; 1927 - 2003 ) , a renowned bullfighter who later became a successful businessman , the company said			2
nearly 18 % of the population were recorded as " soltero " ( single ) ; 11 % were " @entity158 " ( civil and church marriage ) ; 10 % were " @entity164 " ( church marriage ) ; and 8 % were " union libre " ( free union , or living together without marriage )			0
the four most populous @entity3 states were @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170			0
" as the @entity11 is home to the second - largest @entity3 community in the world , @entity3 - @entity11 comprise 10 % of the total @entity11 population			2
therefore , it is fitting that the world 's largest online family history resource now has an expansive collection to serve this important demographic , " said @entity174 , @entity22 executive vice president , in a statement			2
the firm announced the free availability of the documents on its website this month because it 's @entity185			2
@entity1 said the 1930 census would make genealogical research easier and more reliable -- especially because records have n't been evenly maintained in @entity3 's history			1
for example , @entity1 spent eight years trying to find his father 's birth certificate in @entity3 , he said			1
in the end , he never found the birth certificate , but he did find " a birth memoir inside a hospital " that noted his father 's birth in @entity104 in 1922 , @entity1 said			2
" he walked out of the hospital and someone marked it down			0
that 's how we got him , " @entity1 said of his father 's birth			0
@entity1 , who himself was born in @entity207 in 1947 , used that hospital memoir for his father 's birth to obtain dual citizenship with @entity3 several years ago , he said			1
@entity1 ' mother was also born in @entity207 , so securing his father 's @entity3 birth record was critical to @entity1 ' quest to obtain a second , @entity3 citizenship , he said			2
the 1930 census could streamline such family research , he said			2
" this is where i believe people will gain strength			0
as soon as you start to investigate , it 's like a mystery , " @entity1 said			0
" my mother , who 's 85 , knows quite a bit , but we 're now finding about aunts and uncles and grandparents			0

the 1930 census is @entity3 's best of 20th century , online firm says
actor @entity1 calls census " most important document "
there are 31.9 million @entity11 of @entity3 descent
the entire 1930 @entity3 census is now online for free
