in 2006 , this website conducted a highly unscientific survey to find the worst song of all time			1
one year stood out in its bad - song production : 1974			1
that included two of the top five -- @entity15 ' " @entity14 " and the runaway top choice , @entity18 's " @entity17 " -- and several more leading vote - getters , including @entity21 's " @entity20 , " @entity23 's " @entity22 " and @entity24 and the @entity25 ' " @entity13			1
" summer rewind : looking back at 1974 and yet the year was n't a pop - cultural wasteland			1
far from it , as a matter of fact			2
as a year for movies , 1974 is often ranked as the best since the sainted slate of 1939			1
the releases included best picture winner " @entity37 , " " @entity38 , " @entity40 ' one - two punch of " @entity41 " and " @entity42 , " not to mention disaster movies , revenge flicks , conspiracy thrillers and family features			1
it was enough to make you kiss your movie theater while kicking your radio			2
these days , that kind of movie mix is almost unimaginable , when studios race to dominate box - office weekend tallies with comic - book blow - ' em - ups			1
and music ? depends whom you ask , though it has certainly splintered over the last four decades			2
what gives ? ' i think the country was exhausted and traumatized ' it 's worth a look back at an unbeloved year			2
with president @entity76 's resignation , the wind - down of the @entity72 , the end of the @entity74 oil embargo , the rotting of @entity68 , bad weather outbreaks and failing governments , it was a fatiguing time			1
" i think the country was exhausted and traumatized by all the hubbub that was going on , " says @entity78 professor @entity77 , the author of " the @entity79 , " a book about 1970s pop music			1
in addition , the events " took the wind out of the sails " of the counterculture , which had been setting musical trends since the mid- 1960s , says @entity85 performance studies professor @entity84			2
into the breach came escapist and comforting songs appealing to a new generation			1
escapism and comfort often get a bad rap in pop music , @entity77 observes			1
if you 're a teenager or college student trying to impress your friends and form your own cool identity , the last thing you want to confess is a fondness for " seasons in the @entity106 " but that sort of feeling is underrated , he observes			2
" one of the important roles that @entity111 has played is it 's the music you can use to piss off your parents , " he says			2
" ( but ) sometimes music is for solace			0
we do n't like things that too obviously want to be liked			0
but what 's wrong with wanting to be liked ? " reinforcing confusion at the movie theater , on the other hand , a lot of the hits were anything but comforting			0
instead , they reinforced the confusion of the times			0
one reason is that the movie counterculture had risen to positions of power while the old studio system was falling apart			0
directors such as @entity135 and @entity136 liked to shake up their bosses -- and the audience			0
" there 's sort of this brief period where @entity144 studios are willing to take a chance on smaller - budget , more independent - minded films , mainly trying to reach out to the countercultural audience that had emerged during the late 1960s , " says @entity139 , a film professor at @entity140			1
that audience had made hits of such films as " @entity153 , " " @entity154 , " " @entity155 " and " @entity156 , " among many			0
in fact , @entity135 's original " @entity159 " ( 1972 ) -- a gangster epic with some @entity162 twists -- was the highest - grossing film ever at the time			1
the burst of creativity reached a peak in 1974 with a number of films that were both critically praised and financially successful			1
@entity135 's " @entity37 , " despite its three - hour - plus running time and complicated structure , was the fifth biggest - grossing film of the year			1
@entity172 's " @entity38 , " a hard - boiled @entity174 mystery , and @entity175 's " @entity171 , " about a single mother 's attempt to build a life , also finished in the top 20			1
@entity40 ' comedies " @entity41 " and " @entity42 , " the first as anarchic as the latter was meticulous , were no. 1 and no. 3			0
the year 's other hits included the conspiracy thriller " @entity186 , " the vigilante drama " @entity188 , " @entity190 ' prison comedy " @entity191 " and the gritty " @entity192			0
" ' boy , do we need it now ' however , years are never that simple			0
pop music had more variety than its bad - music boosters might remember			1
@entity199 had her biggest success with the album " @entity202			0
" @entity203 had big hits with the @entity205 , @entity206 and the eventual theme to " @entity208 , " " @entity209 ( @entity203 )			0
" @entity210 was at his " @entity212 " zenith			0
and movie audiences still hungered for old - fashioned pleasures			1
disaster films , the all - star forerunners of today 's @entity218 destruct - o - ramas , had both traditional heroes -- @entity221 's fire chief in " the @entity222 , " @entity224 's pilot in " @entity225 " -- and the latest in special effects			1
there were also heartwarming , family - friendly hits , including " @entity229 " and " @entity230 of @entity231 , " two low - budget , no - star successes aimed at @entity234			1
the slogan for " @entity239 , " a hit collection of @entity238 musical clips , summed up the feeling : " boy , do we need it now			0
" but even " @entity247 " was n't without its 1974 ironies , says @entity243 , a media studies professor at the @entity244			1
" @entity238 was falling apart			0
in that movie ( the stars are ) literally touring the destroyed back lot , " he says			0
the personal touch what can we make of all this ? if 1974 did anything , it was lay the groundwork for the future			1
the music business was getting shaken up			0
@entity263 was on its way , being birthed in downtown @entity68			0
" the paradigms are about to shift , " says @entity85 's @entity84 , pointing out that the year 's anomalies would n't be anomalous for long			0
and movies ? they were going the opposite direction , getting ready to embrace the escapist blockbuster and wide openings			1
first came 1975 's " jaws " and then , two years later , 1977 's " @entity274			0
" the suits reasserted control and the @entity277 ended			0
" the studios are reminded , with one movie we can make as much profit as we do with all those others , " says @entity278			0
the shift continues to play out today			1
in the blockbuster era , it 's become increasingly rare for a dialogue - heavy drama or awards - season favorite to break through			2
@entity289 falling , ' gravity ' rising , money spinning : the year in movies 2013 the music business , on the other hand , has gotten more chaotic and splintered			2
whatever : @entity295 can take refuge in micro-genres and , thanks to their @entity300 recommendations , never have to listen to the kind of variety @entity302 -- which was fading in 1974 -- used to symbolize			2
do you remember rock ' n ' roll radio ? that 's one kind of personalization			0
but what 1974 offered was a different kind , says @entity77			2
great filmmakers were following their muses and doing well			2
and heard today , even its much - maligned music has its charms , he says			1
" there 's a sense that ( the artists ) have n't done their market research , " he says			0
" they do n't know what people necessarily want , so you get things that are very quirky at times			0
" that season , you might say , is all gone .			0

1974 featured some much - maligned pop songs but great movies
@entity333 was fatiguing , with @entity76 , @entity332 finally leaving stage
@entity336 was in statis at the time , getting *segmented* ; movies reveled in chaos
some patterns still borne out today
