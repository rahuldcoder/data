-- @entity2 's frontal assault against drug cartels has been " largely ineffective " and in some instances counterproductive to reducing violence , a @entity6 @entity5 report concludes			1
the report , released thursday , was produced by the committee 's majority staff ahead of a political transition in @entity2 's presidency and the @entity6 election , both events that could alter binational cooperation			1
going forward , a focal point of anti-drug cooperation should be training and institution - building in @entity2 's police forces and judiciary , the report says			1
by training police and equipping them to investigate drug - related killings , the military component of @entity2 's current strategy can be scaled back , the report says			1
@entity2 's @entity28 calls for ' new debate ' on the drug war @entity2 president @entity32 's term , which comes to an end in december , will be remembered for a surge in the number of troops deployed across @entity2 to help combat drug cartels			2
a number of high - ranking cartel figures have been arrested , but critics question if the government has achieved anything other than a reshaping of the factions fighting for control of lucrative smuggling routes			0
as the market for which a majority of the illegal drugs are destined , the @entity6 has contributed to @entity2 's efforts through the @entity52			1
@entity53 has appropriated more than $ 1.9 billion for the initiative , which has provided helicopters and equipment , as well as training for police and judges			2
the report calls for continuation of @entity52 funds , but says they should be aimed at helping the police and judiciary			2
" @entity2 's presidential transition provides a new window to discuss and debate the best security strategies to deal with the serious violence plaguing @entity2 , " @entity5 chairman sen. @entity66 said in a written statement			1
" as the political landscape continues to change in both countries , this report underscores the importance of continuity in two critical areas -- judicial and police reform			2
@entity2 have committed to these fundamental reforms and as tough as they will be to implement they are fundamental for any sustained reduction in violence in @entity2			0
these are worthy efforts that must succeed			0
" alleged @entity2 cartel operative ' @entity86 ' arrested according to the report , which was based on interviews in @entity2 with authorities from both countries , as well as experts , @entity2 has so far been slow to accept training for officers			1
@entity95 for the current fiscal year will be largely directed toward capacity - building , and the report recommends that the @entity6 continue to stress the importance of reforms			0
the report recommends continuing @entity52 funds at $ 250 million a year for four more years			0
even if @entity2 resorts to using the military as a stop - gap measure to combat the violence , " increased civilian police capabilities will obviate the need to deploy military personnel for domestic security purposes , " the report says			1
@entity2 's federal police force has made strides in both size and capacity over the past several years , but reforms in state and local police departments have lagged , the report states			1
the @entity2 government can succeed only if it enlists the help of state and local police , the report says			1
it is a tall order -- corruption is most prevalent at the local and state levels , where officers are routinely on the payrolls of the various drug trafficking organizations			0
@entity28 , @entity2 's presumptive president - elect , told @entity0 's @entity130 this week that he is open to a new debate on how to wage the war on drug trafficking , which will include a review with @entity6 participation			0
" what we seek now in our new strategy is to adjust what 's been done up until now			0
it 's not a radical change			0
it 's to broaden the coverage and , above all , the emphasis i aspire to of reducing the violence in our country , " @entity28 said			0
the @entity5 report puts the number of drug - related deaths during @entity32 's term at more than 55,000			2
on the border : guns , drugs -- and a betrayal of trust			0

the majority staff of the @entity5 releases a report on @entity2
it concludes that the focus should be on training police and judiciary
the report says the largely military effort has been ineffective or counterproductive
