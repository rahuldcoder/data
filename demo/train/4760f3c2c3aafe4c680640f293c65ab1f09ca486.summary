-- in the past two weeks , police have killed at least four people with psychiatric disabilities , each of whom had a weapon			1
most recently , police in @entity8 shot @entity9 , killing him just a few miles from @entity10 , @entity11			1
@entity9 is black and his death initially ratcheted up tensions , but people have since seemed to accept police explanations			1
@entity9 acted erratically , had a knife and refused to put it down			0
mental illness made it , in the eyes of many , a sad but unpreventable situation			1
in cases like these , we need to stop talking about mental illness and start thinking through the implications of psychiatric disabilities			1
we also need police whose first instinct is to de-escalate tense situations whenever and however possible , and , when necessary , solve confrontations with the absolute minimum amount of force			1
" psychiatric disability " refers to mental illness that " significantly interferes with the performance of major life activities , " a category that clearly applies to people whose " erratic behavior " got them killed by police			1
in @entity44 , being disabled comes with certain civil rights protections			1
while we generally try to eradicate illness , we are required to accommodate disability			1
so how does a police officer accommodate someone behaving erratically and holding a knife ? here are the details of the four cases			1
they came from different races , classes , ages and parts of the country			0
in each case , police demanded that a disabled person choose between not being disabled or getting shot			1
now four more people are dead			1
after @entity8 police killed @entity9 , they tried to be transparent			1
they called a news conference , released the incident report , 911 calls and a graphic cell phone video			0
according to the police , two officers arrived to deal with an individual acting " erratically			1
" the officers had been trained to recognize mental illness			1
they got out of their car			0
the officers drew their weapons and ordered @entity9 to drop it and stop			0
on the video , you can hear them firing about seven times			0
while some journalists have pointed out discrepancies between the police account and the video , the chief has defended his officers			1
once the man would n't stop and was within a few feet , what else could they do but shoot ? police in @entity93 used a similar explanation after shooting @entity95			2
police had arrived to carry out an emergency court order to take her to a mental health facility , called for by her mother			1
police had trouble getting her to open the door			2
she 'd open and close it , repeatedly			0
as the officers forced their way in , @entity95 came out with a claw hammer			0
according to witnesses and a spokesman , the officers told her to drop the hammer several times , then shot her when she did not comply			0
in the aftermath , @entity116 police have lamented the tragedy and promised to implement new training , likely to be " @entity120 " ( @entity120 ) training , an approach that is being implemented all over the country			2
it 's great , but wo n't solve everything			0
in @entity127 , a @entity120 - trained officer shot and killed a 19 - year - old woman holding a power drill			1
@entity130 , who had bipolar disorder , had called police to claim she had an @entity133 and would shoot her family			2
police understandably responded in numbers and started negotiating			2
@entity137 came outside but would n't drop the object she was holding			0
as reported in the @entity145 , " they told her many times to stop , to drop her weapon , " one witness said			0
" and she did n't			0
" one of the five officers fired , just once			0
@entity9 had a steak knife , @entity95 a hammer , and showman a drill			0
@entity151 , in @entity152 , actually had a military combat knife			0
the actual danger of the weapon , though , does n't change the shape of the story			0
police arrived at the scene because a neighbor heard @entity161 ranting loudly about , " four horsemen , cutting hearts out and stuff			2
" @entity161 threatened the officers verbally and the police told him to drop the knife , but instead he charged			2
an officer shot and killed him			1
except for the fact that @entity9 was shot repeatedly , a detail that intensifies the racially charged aspect of that killing , the stories follow a similar pattern			0
the victim had a weapon and did not respond to police commands to drop it , and so they died			2
of course , a person struggling with his or her disability is not likely to follow verbal police commands in a moment of stress			2
once the equation reached drop or die , death was inevitable			0
the only solution is for the police to avoid getting into that situation if at all possible			1
unfortunately , this runs directly against police training			2
police are trained to display command presence in the face of uncertainly , seizing control of a situation by issuing orders , demanding compliance and using force on those who wo n't obey			2
protect and serve has become command and control			0
@entity209 police now teach their recruits to be " guardians			1
when @entity95 frustrated the police by opening and closing the door repeatedly , why not just wait her out ? moreover , where were the @entity217 ? taser - overuse is a major problem , but if they have a place in modern policing , surely it 's when confronted by an armed psychiatrically disabled person at close range			1
there will always be terrible situations in which police must shoot to kill someone struggling with their disability			0
there could be a lot fewer			0
moreover , accommodations for disability tend to have positive ripple effects for the whole population			0
every time an able - bodied person uses an automatic door or wheelchair ramp while pulling a suitcase or stroller , they should thank the @entity44 with @entity242 and the power of accommodations			0
similarly , if police will accommodate psychiatric disability by not forcing confrontation whenever possible , we will all be a lot safer .			1

in the past two weeks , police have killed at least four people with psychiatric disabilities
@entity254 : how does a police officer accommodate someone with mental illness ?
he says one solution is to train police to act like guardians , another is to use @entity217
@entity254 : being disabled comes with civil rights protections , we can *include* the mentally ill
