-- @entity1 had the lowest voter turnout rate in the @entity3 in 2008 , with fewer than half of the eligible population casting ballots			1
when i traveled to the state to find out why , i thought most of the problem might be apathy			2
the surfer thing , you know ? that is part of it , to be sure			0
but there are many reasons @entity3 's 50th state does n't vote as much as the other 49 , plenty of them specific to @entity1			1
here 's a bite - sized look at eight			0
if you want to be part of the solution , help us change the list by convincing these five people to vote for the first time , making a pledge to vote or sharing this " @entity30 for @entity31 ! " image on @entity33 or @entity34			2
background : introducing @entity0 's @entity35 @entity1 : the state that does n't vote and , as if i 'm not asking enough already , let me know what you think of this list in the comments section at the bottom of the story			1
if you have other ideas , i may add them			0
surfer apathy : i 'll start with the obvious one			0
it 's true that some people are so wrapped up in @entity1 's beaches and waves that they do n't care about politics			1
one woman told me politics do n't " flow " in oh - so - laid - back @entity1			1
a state representative in @entity54 said he looks at swell reports before @entity56			2
if the waves are big , he said , he knows turnout will be low			2
ugly history : a fair number of @entity62 people consider the @entity3 to be illegitimately occupying @entity1 , and some do n't vote on principle			1
one woman told me that part of her identity as a @entity62 would be diluted if she cast a ballot			0
the @entity3 apologized in 1993 for its unlawful takeover of the islands , but resentment remains			0
when it 's 6 p.m. in @entity1 , it 's midnight in @entity74 : the @entity1 is six hours behind @entity75			1
by the time its polls close , presidents often have been declared			2
one woman who lives on the @entity79 of @entity1 told me she was driving from work to her polling place when she heard the winner of a presidential race announced on the radio			1
she turned the car around and drove home without voting			0
in the bigger picture , the time zone issue -- and the thousands of miles of ocean that come with it -- leave @entity1 feeling detached from national politics			1
the @entity3 and @entity1 are like " apples and bananas , " one man told me			1
the state feels like an afterthought			2
it 's basically a one - party state : who wants to vote if it seems like there 's no real choice to be made ? @entity104 have dominated politics in @entity1 for decades			1
many races in the state are uncontested because the @entity108 ca n't find candidates to run in them			2
currently , there 's only one @entity108 in @entity1 's state @entity111			1
the state 's electoral votes have gone to @entity108 presidential candidates only twice in history			1
polling places ca n't be trusted : that 's the feeling at least on the @entity79 of @entity1			1
during the primary election this year , some polling places opened an hour and a half late because voter registries had n't been delivered to the polling stations			2
the state is stepping in to try to make sure november elections are conducted with more professionalism			0
but i met a sous - chef in @entity129 who said that 's too little , too late			0
he does n't trust the polls because he had so much trouble voting before			0
people do n't identify as voters : i found it fascinating that many people in @entity1 do n't vote at least in part because they do n't see themselves as the type of people who participate in civil society			1
a 36 - year - old man told me he never voted until two years ago , when he found a website asking people to pledge to vote			0
once someone invited him into the system , he participated			0
no one had asked before			0
he ran for a seat in the state @entity151 in the primary election this year			0
the schools are bad : i heard from many adults in @entity1 that the school system does not do a good job teaching young people about politics and how decisions made by politicians affect their day - to - day lives			2
there are exceptions , of course , like @entity168 's class at a high school near @entity170			0
there , i met a young woman who said she did n't see the importance of voting until @entity168 led a conversation on the topic			0
but the state should do a better job educating the next generation of voters			0
election laws make it too hard to register : there are plenty of available tools that would make voting easier in @entity1 , including same - day voter registration , which would let people walk into a polling place on election day , register and vote right then ; and online registration , which @entity1 plans to implement in 2016			1
i heard time and again from non-voters that they did n't have a clue about how to register			0
states like @entity195 that have implemented progressive registration policies see higher turnout rates			0
that state topped the list , with a 78 % participation rate			1
what do you think would help increase voter participation in @entity1 ? let me know in the comments			1
your idea may be part of a future story on @entity0 .			2

@entity1 had the lowest voter turnout rate in 2008
@entity0 is doing stories on the state to try to boost participation
an ugly history , @entity104 dominance and time zones are to blame
and , sure , there are some *apathetic* surfers in the state , too
