-- when @entity3 opened a new grocery store in a tough neighborhood in @entity6 , what he did not put on the outside -- bars on the windows -- was as important as what he did put inside -- fresh fruits and vegetables , affordably priced			1
with his @entity17 convenience store and @entity19 supermarket , @entity3 , who portrayed @entity12 on " @entity13 " and @entity14 on " @entity15 , " is turning food desert neighborhoods into food oases			1
while @entity3 is a hit in the food - access movement , the stores , and his style , are also manifestations of a commitment to place			1
spending an afternoon with @entity3 in @entity6 , his hometown , it 's easy to see @entity3 's larger purpose			1
in the language of the @entity34 , @entity3 's work is about placemaking			1
through his neighborhood inquiry , @entity34 founder @entity36 crafted a definition of placemaking : " turning a neighborhood , town or city from a place you ca n't wait to get through to one you never want to leave			1
" so it 's magical to have fresh papaya , melons and bell peppers in @entity3 's supermarket , but it 's not enough			1
@entity3 's team set up a technology - driven security system that lets the supermarket operate efficiently , without bars on the windows			1
he saw neighbors walking home , loaded down with grocery bags in the @entity6 heat , and imagined an amenity			1
now @entity19 offers free rides home for customers spending $ 50 or more			0
the branded suv is a rolling reminder that the store is sensitive to neighborhood needs			1
in his @entity17 convenience store , the fresh bananas by the register signal an interest in healthy customers			2

part of the @entity89 , @entity83 is a national model for neighborhood transformation			2
housing , education , workforce training , recreation and wellness programs are integrated into one place			2
@entity3 is bringing a supermarket			1
it 's the same dirt underneath			2
@entity101 believes in the approach and is backing @entity89			2
@entity83 is a good lesson for charitable foundations that often parse life into a list of simple check - boxes , one for education , one for transit , one for arts and so on			2
placemaking recognizes that all these things , and more , are tied			0
with a community kitchen , @entity83 can offer cooking classes to families that get new access to fresh produce , thanks to @entity19 , which is also generating jobs			0
the fitness center makes regular physical activity the norm , not the exception , and the design invites residents to walk , not ride , to school			0
the community garden lets kids put their hands in the dirt , which reinforces the science being taught from preschool through high school			0
around the country , the allure of placemaking is evident			0
@entity138 's @entity137 is more than an elevated walkway			0
its arrival ignited recreation , environmental inquiry , congregation , arts and romance			0
the @entity147 draws thousands of people to its streets alive events , modeled after @entity83 's @entity151			0
there is attention to better biking , but mostly it 's residents coming together to make a better place			1
in @entity159 , the @entity158 is re-shaping residential life ,			0
featuring 122 miles of new commuter and light rail lines , @entity158 promotes " a pedestrian - oriented environment that allows people to live , work , shop and play in places accessible by transit			0
" @entity169 , author of " the @entity170 : the @entity173 , " is an expert on placemaking			0
communities that figure out placemaking , @entity169 believes , will see greater economic growth and improved quality of life			0
he 's developing 25 case studies on the best placemaking ideas from @entity182 cities			2
perhaps a key to placemaking is the ability to see the potential for beauty in situations where others see a tangle of bad			0
or , as @entity34 encourages , " start with the petunias			0
" this is how an abandoned rail line , a nuisance and a danger , becomes a space famous for its sunset views			0
@entity3 's vision for placemaking is rooted in recollections of the places of his youth			1
he grew up in @entity204			0
" it 's the memory of that friday night grocery trip that i used to take with my mother , " @entity3 told @entity205			1
" it was the town square , you know , men and women getting off of work and you would see them at our neighborhood grocery store			1
for , you know , a little 8 - year - old boy that was , you know , the fishmonger in the butcher , these were , you know , common people in my life on the beginning of my weekend , and i felt as though that was something culturally that everybody should have in their neighborhood			0
