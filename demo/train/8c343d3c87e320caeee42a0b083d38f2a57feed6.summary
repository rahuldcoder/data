-- a free speech dispute over a @entity3 law banning the sale of violent video games to children is set to be heard in the @entity8 @entity7 this week			1
arguments in @entity10 v. @entity11 are scheduled to take place tuesday and wednesday			0
a 2005 state law -- designed to strengthen the current industry - controlled rating system -- would have placed an outright ban on the sale or rental of games deemed excessively " violent " to those under 18			1
as defined by @entity3 , such interactive games are those in which the player is given the choice of " killing , maiming , dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being " in offensive ways			1
retailers could be fined up to $ 1,000 for any violation			0
the law is in limbo pending the high court 's ruling			1
video game makers have said the ban goes too far against their free speech rights , and the existing industry - imposed , nationwide voluntary ratings system is an adequate screen for parents to judge the appropriateness of computer games			2
the state says it has a legal obligation to protect children when the industry has failed to do so			0
the motion picture industry has its own self - monitoring ratings system , imposed decades ago after complaints that some films were too explicit for the general audience			0
a high court ruling allowing greater government control over the evaluation of expressive content could be applied to other media			0
the @entity7 in recent years has thwarted repeated congressional attempts to protect children from pornography , saying such legislation went too far in limiting adult access to lawful but explicit sexual content on the internet			1
the court has also said in various contexts that minors enjoy a variety of free - expression rights			0
