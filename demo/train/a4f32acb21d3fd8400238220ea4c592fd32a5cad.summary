the @entity0 is advising airlines with direct flights serving @entity3 to be aware of the possibility that explosive materials could be concealed in toothpaste or cosmetic tubes , the chairman of the @entity9 said wednesday night			1
rep. @entity10 said the @entity11 issued a bulletin to airlines flying into @entity3 warning of the potential threat			1
the bulletin , the @entity17 @entity16 said , indicated that officials believed the explosives might be used during flights or smuggled into the city of @entity23 , where competition at the @entity25 begins thursday			1
the opening ceremony is friday			0
a @entity0 law enforcement official told @entity28 that the cause for the homeland security alert was specific to the imminent start of the games			1
according to the source , authorities have increasing confidence about the safety of @entity23 and the @entity38 venues			0
still , @entity0 intelligence is picking up increasing chatter that causes worry about targets outside the @entity23 area , including regional transportation links			1
the biggest ongoing worry outside this new concern -- as expected -- is groups based in southern @entity3 's @entity48 , in particular the restive @entity49			1
however , @entity0 officials also are worried that @entity52 - linked groups from elsewhere could take advantage of the attention being focused on @entity3 militant groups			1
the concern about the use of toothpaste tubes is mostly focused on flights from @entity60 and neighboring @entity62 countries -- in part because the @entity0 has less intelligence - sharing with those nations			1
a separate @entity0 official with knowledge of the current situation , who would not speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation , said the @entity0 intelligence community is still assessing the credibility and scope of the threat			1
the official said the @entity3 brought some information to the @entity0			1
two senior administration officials told @entity28 that @entity0 authorities had intelligence that they shared with the @entity3			1
assessing the credibility includes looking at the latest intelligence about the location and capabilities of known terrorist bomb makers and which groups may have the ability to build a bomb in a container such as a toothpaste tube			0
such a device would likely require hard - to - detect explosives and little or no metal content in other critical parts , such as the detonator			0
observers ask : is @entity23 ready ? no known threat to the @entity0 earlier wednesday , a different law enforcement source emphasized there was no known threat to the @entity0 , but the notice to @entity0 and international air carriers is based on new intelligence information			1
it 's real and we got very good information , " a government source , who did not want to speak for full attribution , told @entity28			1
" it 's based on a credible source			2
we 're taking it seriously			0
... " @entity11 said that " out of an abundance of caution " it routinely shares " relevant information " with domestic and international entities , " including those associated with international events " like the @entity120			0
a large majority of direct flights into @entity3 will come from @entity60 or neighboring @entity62 countries			2
only a few will originate in the @entity0			2
@entity3 transportation officials have banned liquids in airline carry - on luggage ahead of the games , according to a report from the @entity3 news agency @entity131			1
a former airline security chief anticipated that the threat will prompt authorities in the @entity0 and @entity60 to clamp down on toothpaste and cosmetics			1
" my prediction is that they will give a direct order that they 'll be removing toothpaste from passengers ' hand - carried items " and possibly from checked luggage as well , said @entity137 , a former security director at @entity139 and @entity140 airlines			0
@entity28 poll : 57 % of @entity0 think terror attack likely at @entity120 how far - reaching is ' ring of steel ' ? @entity11 and @entity153 officials declined to say what , if any , security actions they are contemplating in light of the threat			1
rep. @entity158 , chairman of the @entity9 's subcommittee on terrorism and @entity161 , said on @entity28 's " @entity162 " that @entity0 , the airlines and those at the @entity25 should take the threat " very seriously			1
" @entity158 , a @entity166 @entity16 , said he believes the athletes and @entity0 spectators are " reasonably safe , " but noted that he would not go himself			2
" just as a spectator , i do n't think it 's worth the risk			0
i mean , odds are nothing is going to happen , but the odds are higher than for any other @entity25 , i believe , that something could happen , " he said			2
@entity158 said he has some confidence in how the @entity3 are handling security , but " really not enough because they are not sharing enough intelligence " about what 's happening inside the country			2
" we are getting some information about what 's happening outside of @entity3 , some external threats , that type thing , or potential threats			2
i do n't want to overstate that , " he said			0
he noted a " ring of steel right around the @entity25 itself " but said " there 's a real cause for concern " about getting to @entity23 and surrounding areas			2
' anybody who wants to go ... should go ' the @entity196 administration has not indicated it is not safe to travel to the @entity25			2
secretary of state @entity198 , in an exclusive interview with @entity28 's " the lead with @entity201 " before the toothpaste alert broke , said that " anybody who wants to go to the @entity25 , which are just a great event , should go			1
and we 're not telling people not to go			0
" @entity198 added that people should be alert and take precautions , advice he says has been requisite since the 9/11 attacks			0
" we 've got a new consciousness about this , " he said			0
a senior administration official said it would make any information public through the @entity217 should it receive information that " changes our assessment of whether people should travel to @entity23			0
" @entity221 , a top @entity0 counterterrorism official , highlighted concern in testimony to @entity224 on tuesday about whether @entity226 fundamentalists in disputed regions of @entity3 -- or other groups -- could launch attacks on selected targets			1
" there are a number of specific threats of varying degrees of credibility that we 're tracking , " he said			0
" and we 're working very closely with the @entity3 and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those			0
" @entity28 has learned this threat is the one @entity239 was referring to in his testimony			2
terrorism experts say that airlines continue to be a target of terrorists wishing to make a spectacular impact with an attack			0
the focus since 2001 has shifted from hijackings to bombs , especially those that might be hidden in luggage			0
@entity0 authorities are also mindful of creative packaging or other novel ways to conceal explosives			0
for instance , a failed attempt to blow up an overseas flight heading to @entity258 on christmas day in 2009 involved a bomb concealed in a passenger 's underwear			0
shortly after 9/11 a man was convicted of trying to blow up a transatlantic flight with explosives hidden in his shoes			0
@entity3 say authorities rounding up , poisoning stray dogs before @entity25			1

two @entity0 officials tell @entity28 that information was shared with the @entity3
source says threat is specific to start of the @entity25 this week
@entity277 tells @entity28 that @entity3 shared some information with @entity0
warning to airlines *globally* that serve @entity3 based on new intelligence
