-- @entity1 has always relied on a fighter 's instinct -- both in and out of the boxing ring			1
the @entity5 was once idolized as the youngest heavyweight champion of the world only to be swiped off his pedestal by criminal convictions and drug addictions			1
but at the age of 47 , and long since retired from the ring , the provocative pugilist told @entity0 he is only now facing his biggest battle			2
" being responsible - that 's going to be the most difficult fight in my life , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity15 for her unguarded series			1
" i 've never been responsible before			0
just being a good husband and a good father			0
this is the biggest fight			1
this is the fight i 'm taking with open arms			0
" @entity1 , who is married to @entity25 , his third wife , and has fathered eight children , is determined to focus on his family and a new generation of young boxers after a high - profile and controversial career			1
fatherhood for the man dubbed " @entity1 " is framed against his own experience as a shy kid turned street fighter growing up in the @entity38 area of @entity39			2
" drugs , thefts , gang infested , crime infested , " @entity1 recalled of his childhood neighborhood			2
" to this day , i ca n't figure how from there , at that particular time , i made it to where i am now			2
" a teenage @entity1 , by now spending time in a reform school , found an exit when his talents in the ring were spotted by respected trainer @entity53			1
at the age of 18 , @entity1 turned professional and was soon undefeated in 22 bouts			2
two years later , in 1986 , the young @entity5 knocked out @entity56 to become the youngest heavyweight world champion in history			1
@entity1 went undefeated for another four years but , with the benefit of hindsight , he now sees that heady era of fame and fortune very differently			1
" i do n't like that time in my life , " @entity1 continued			1
" i did n't like the person i was back then			1
" even with all that money and all that success i had , i did n't get anything done			0
my kids never saw me			0
i was a horrible father			0
" there were more life lessons for @entity1 when in 1992 he was found guilty of rape and sentenced to 10 years in prison			1
on his release , the @entity39 boxer returned to the ring but controversy soon followed in the infamous " bite fight " against @entity79			0
during the duo 's second heavyweight title bout in 1997 , @entity1 chewed off a chunk of @entity79 's ear			1
he was later served with a one - year boxing ban			0
but just as @entity1 's reflections of the highs have changed over time , the same can be said of these low points			1
commenting on the so - called " bite fight " @entity1 said : " even though i was an undisciplined it was the only way i could get any kind of relief			1
" i 'm sad i bit his ear			0
i really am sorry because i like @entity79 , he 's a good guy , a really good guy			0
" of the rape charges , @entity1 contemplated : " that may cause more controversy in my life , but that 's not the lowest moment of my life			1
" in his interview with @entity15 , he describes the tragic death of his four - year - old daughter @entity103 in 2009 as his nadir			0
the highlights for the 47 - year - old @entity1 , who is tentatively clean from his addictions , remain ahead			1
" i 'm accomplishing so much and getting so much done now as a human being , than i could 've ever done back then in the prime of my fighting career , " he explained			0
" the best i am , and the best i 've ever been , is right now			0
this is the best i 'm going to ever be , compared to who i was before			0
" @entity1 retired from the ring in 2005 and has been fighting his way out of bankruptcy with a one - man @entity116 show , cameos in @entity119 films and now as author of his autobiography " @entity122			2
" there is also a new project that may bring his career full circle			0
@entity1 , under the umbrella of @entity128 , is now working as a promoter for a batch of promising young boxers			1
" i 'll give them the best advice i possibly can , " said @entity1			2
" i 'm just never gon na baby them			0
this is just what it is , you know			0
" they have to be responsible , like i was n't			2
i was n't a responsible fighter			2
" out of the ring , @entity1 , with his trademark black tattoo arcing over his left eye , is looking for responsibility and perhaps even redemption at last .			0
