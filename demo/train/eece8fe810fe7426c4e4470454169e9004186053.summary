-- @entity1 is daring to dream -- just not too big yet			1
halfway through a sensational first @entity5 season with reigning constructors ' champion @entity8 , it is easy to see why the @entity9 is in reflective mood			1
@entity1 returns to the track at next week 's @entity12 with two race wins in his pocket after he followed up a career - first in @entity16 with victory last time out in @entity19			1
with eight races left to run , the 25 - year - old finds himself in the unusual position of being the only driver apart from dueling @entity25 duo @entity24 and @entity26 to take the checkered flag this season			1
" i definitely do n't look too far ahead , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity29 at @entity8 's headquarters near @entity31 , @entity32			1
" i do n't get over-excited			0
i just try and focus on getting all the steps right and then believe that will turn into a good string of results			0
" i 've just got to keep doing what i 'm doing and keep learning as i go along			0
" with the mighty @entity25 pair out in front of the field , @entity1 knows he is unlikely to snatch the title from their grasp in the second half of the year			1
blog : the steel of @entity5 's bubbly new star but after such an encouraging start , @entity1 -- who is 71 points behind championship leader @entity24 -- does n't want to shackle his ambition			2
" since i entered @entity5 the second part of the season has always gone better for me , " he said			2
" i seem to learn from the first six months and really put it towards better results in the second half of the year			0
" we will see how it 's going and try to get a few more wins			2
" @entity8 's newest recruit is also keen to retain the upper hand over his illustrious teammate @entity60 , having impressed since making the step up from @entity8 's sister team @entity62			1
@entity1 has out - qualified the four - time world champion at six of the 11 grands prix so far this season , and a 9 - 2 lead in race position ( including his @entity9 gp result before he was later disqualified for a fuel - flow irregularity )			1
" i wo n't lie to you -- it feels great , " @entity1 said of his performance compared with the @entity71			2
" he is an awesome benchmark to judge myself on			0
" to have shown really good speed against him , not only in qualifying but in races as well , has been encouraging			2
" the @entity5 season resumes next week at the legendary @entity82 circuit set amid the @entity83 in @entity84			0
the fast , flowing and undulating track is unlikely to play to the strengths of @entity8 's car , which has lagged behind @entity25 in terms of straight - line speed			1
" spa is a fun track , " said @entity1			2
" you feel like , in a way , you get a little bit lost out there			0
you feel like you 're driving in a forest			0
" there are some very long straights , which will unfortunately give a bit of lap time away			0
" we will see -- it is probably going to be one of those tracks where we 're there or thereabouts			0
" the same can be said of @entity1 this season -- there or thereabouts , and then some			1
