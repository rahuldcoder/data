@entity0 -- big divisions are appearing among the key players responsible for the eurozone 's tough austerity program			1
the @entity6 and the @entity7 are at odds over which is the best way forward			1
as millions of @entity11 feel the biting impact of austerity measures , @entity6 boss @entity10 says it 's time to hit the brakes			1
@entity17 finance minister @entity16 says changing directions now would lead to a critical loss of confidence in the whole plan			0
and @entity7 vice president @entity22 says the @entity6 's findings " can be disputed			1
" it started on monday when the @entity6 said that specific debt reduction targets , which underpin most of the austerity programs in place across recession - ravaged @entity11 , have a much deeper impact that expected			1
new @entity6 research says that pruning a budget deficit by one percentage point could mean a cut in economic growth of between 0.9 % and 1.7 %			1
that is up to three times more severe than the current economic models suggest			2
in other words , debt reduction is having a much more severe affect on growth than first thought			2
it 's led @entity10 to say that the austerity programs should not focus on specific targets and that countries should be given more time to cut their debt			1
@entity16 shot back the next day			0
he told the @entity46 " when there is a certain medium - term goal it does n't build confidence when one starts going in a different direction			0
" " when you want to climb a big mountain and you start climbing back down the mountain , then the mountain will get even higher , " he said			0
next to weigh in was @entity22			1
he told me today that he was not yet buying the @entity6 argument			1
" the findings can be disputed and i am looking forward to extensive negotiations on this , " he said			1
" even the @entity6 can be open to criticism -- it does not have the final word			2
" so , a needed debate or a dangerous split ? @entity22 , ever the diplomat , says he sees this as a sign of " healthy policy debate over the right course of action			2
" but he does support the @entity17 view			0
" he ( @entity16 ) has a point			0
the @entity73 can not be making swift turns , rather it is a convoy and you have to carefully consider which policy turns are best			0
" the @entity73 will produce its own conclusions about the impact of austerity measures next month			2
whether that brings us any closer to a consensus is hard to judge			0
remember the old joke about economists : if you laid all the economists in the world end - to - end you still would n't reach a conclusion			0
but this is no joking matter			0
millions of @entity11 have fallen into poverty or at least economic hardship as a result of the current austerity programs			2
getting the right mix of policies to deal with the crisis not an option , it 's an imperative .			0
