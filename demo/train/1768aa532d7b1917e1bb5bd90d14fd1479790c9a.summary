-- the @entity2 mystery remains unresolved			0
while it is too early to speculate about the cause of the airliner 's disappearance , it is not a surprise that at least two people were able to board @entity10 with stolen passports			1
the fact is the world is far from having a foolproof system for checking travelers who move across borders			0
more than 50 % of transborder passenger movements take place at airports , but how passengers are treated in security lines at the world 's 600 - plus major international airports is very much dependent on local regulations and practices			1
various international organizations have proposed so - called " smart " solutions , such as biometric passports and electronic visas , but many forms of documentation used every day by millions of airline passengers are not digitized and are not being checked against any international databases			0
moreover , without biometric protection , it is always possible to tamper with conventional passports , including the passport holder 's photograph , something that might have happened here			0
of course , there are some important exceptions where tighter controls prevail			0
in the @entity49 , the nations that belong to the " @entity48 " agreement , which abolished internal borders among 27 @entity47 countries , use a shared security database for travelers moving within the @entity48 - area member states			1
the @entity53 , the @entity54 and the @entity55 are the biggest users of the @entity58 database for lost or stolen travel documents			1
importantly , too , the @entity53 requires airlines entering and leaving @entity53 territory to submit travel document information about all passengers			1
nevertheless , it remains true , even in a world that values security , that nations continue to have their own ideas about how to monitor travelers , how security information should be shared and to what extent identity information should be the subject of strong privacy protection			2
most of the 190 nations that belong to @entity58 , for example , simply do not bother to use the database even though they have access to it			1
as to privacy , even the @entity53 and @entity49 have different approaches , with the @entity49 treating personal identity information as part of human and civil rights , while the @entity53 authorities seem to have taken the view that individual privacy is almost always subject to national security concerns			1
diversity among nations ' practices , therefore , can produce situations where travel document problems are missed or overlooked			0
@entity95 is far from being the only country where the passports of outgoing passengers are not typically checked			2
while we do not yet know the exact sequence of events , it is possible that @entity103 would have checked the stolen passports had it been required to issue visas			2
but no visas were required because the tickets were for continuing travel to @entity109 , @entity110			0
it is possible , though not of course yet certain , that existing procedures meant that @entity95 in effect passed responsibility to @entity103 and that @entity103 deferred to the @entity110			0
thus , all three nations probably complied with their own procedures and were not in violation of any international law or practice			0
the lack of alignment among these various nations ' procedures , however , meant that the passengers could use stolen travel documents to proceed through several security lines			1
the lessons from all of these national variations are clear : first , nations that develop their own security databases should still cross-check them with existing international systems such as @entity58			2
and second , the time has come for global coordination and standardized procedures for processing travel documentation : that includes not only widespread adoption of biometric travel documents , but also better coordination among nations as to where responsibility lies for checking documents that travelers use to identify themselves			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

@entity150 : it 's not surprising that at least two on @entity95 *flight* had stolen passports
he says how passengers treated on security lines varies with nations ' regulations
he says many @entity58 member nations do *n't* use database -- even @entity53 , @entity49 differ on privacy
@entity150 : it 's time for global coordination , standardization for processing travel documents
