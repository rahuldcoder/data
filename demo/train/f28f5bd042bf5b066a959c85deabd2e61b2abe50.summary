-- @entity1 is not your typical @entity3 reality show star			1
as friend @entity9 puts it , " while ( the " @entity6 " cast ) is out fist - pumping , @entity1 is in her dorm room watching @entity8			1
" @entity11 's show , " @entity10 as @entity1 , " chronicled the self - described nerd 's senior year of high school in @entity15 during its first season last year			1
its second season , centering around @entity11 's time in college in @entity20 , premiered february 8 at 11 p.m. et , with an 89 % increase in viewership from the series premiere , according to @entity3			1
" the executives at @entity3 are really smart			2
the fact that a show like that is on now is amazing and great , " said @entity9 , who hosted his own show on @entity3 as a teenager ( from his bedroom , no less ) , " @entity28 , " in the mid- 1990s			1
" @entity10 as @entity1 " is " the one thing where someone 's not pregnant or drunk ; it 's what real people are like			1
" the show has quickly amassed a big following on @entity38 -- not just the hundreds of thousands who follow @entity11 and her co-stars , but in @entity38 feeds like " @ thelizalliance			1
" more than 1.8 million people have viewed a clip of the most memorable moment from the show on @entity47 , in which a nervous @entity11 stepped in front of a microphone at a talent show and blew everyone away with her singing			1
like many @entity3 reality shows , it 's not without its share of controversy			1
its detractors have criticized its level of " reality			0
" for the record , @entity11 told @entity0 , " the people , the places , they 're all real			2
all the people on the show , i actually know them , and we actually have relationships			2
" @entity3 also told the @entity70 last year that neither the terms " reality show " nor " sitcom " fully captured the show			1
but " @entity10 as @entity1 " is unique for another criticism that has been leveled against the show 's star : " my nerd cred is attacked all the time			1
people think that that was fabricated by @entity3			2
that 's the hardest rumor for me to deal with			2
" during its first season , one anonymous message board posting , especially , claimed that @entity11 fell in with her school 's geeky crowd as a way to remain " cool " after losing favor with the popular students , and even alleged that she did n't know who @entity89 was			1
" when people ( online ) say , ' you 're not a real nerd , ' " said @entity11 , " i 'm sitting in my room with shelves overflowing with stacks of comic books			1
" @entity98 , author of " @entity99 , " noted , " when you have people choosing to be nerds , questions of authenticity can come up			0
before , you had no choice to be a nerd			0
now that it 's an acceptable option , you can accuse someone of being that way just to be cool			0
when it was uncool , you never had to worry about authenticity			0
" as a reflection of the rest of pop culture , something it has captured for nearly 30 years , @entity3 has embraced geeks in a big way ( the sitcom " @entity119 of @entity120 " will start its second season soon , and there 's even a site called " @entity3 " now )			1
in fact , even though @entity3 means " @entity6 , " " @entity124 " or " @entity125 " to most , it has had its moments over the years of standing up for nerds ( " @entity28 " among them )			2
" @entity1 " something of a sister show to " @entity131			1
" the show evolved from what would have been a second season of that show , which had focused on journalism geek @entity131			0
it 's also a cousin to " made , " @entity3 's long - running series where someone , usually someone who is socially awkward , gets coached into improving something in their life , whether it be working up the nerve to ask out their crush or becoming an athlete or a hip hop dancer			1
the network 's best known example of a nerd -- a fellow nerd girl , no less -- is " @entity155 , " the animated spinoff of " @entity153 , " which started in 1997 and lasted for five seasons			1
@entity11 herself sees @entity155 as an inspiration			1
" @entity155 made it cool to be a smart chick , " said writer @entity158 , who worked at @entity3 for eight years			1
" just the presence of people or characters like @entity155 help make it cool to be yourself			2
there 's a tendency for young girls to play dumb			0
characters like @entity155 show you that you do n't have to			2
" @entity3 's dabbling in nerd culture goes back even further , however			1
@entity171 was a @entity172 for the network for seven years as it made its transition away from only playing music videos			0
around the time he started in the late 1980s , @entity176 was a special correspondent for the network			0
those who have seen the movie " @entity180 , " or read the comic book it was based on , might remember @entity176 having adopted the title " genuine nerd			0
" " he was completely real , " said @entity171			0
" it was just something completely weird and different , that in a way it made so much sense to use him			0
" @entity171 , who considers himself a geek -- he registered the @entity3 domain before most people knew what such a thing even meant , then went on to become an early adopter to podcasts -- sees " @entity1 " as similar to other reality shows			1
" the objective gives the viewer the illusion that they can be famous			0
' hey , it 's ok to be a nerd , you can be famous			2
you 're a pregnant teenager ? hey , you can be famous			0
' @entity204 has exploded because nerds can be successful			0
" then there 's the show that introduced " @entity153 " to the world , " @entity213 , " an anthology of experimental animation that aired in the 1990s that appealed to animation buffs			2
" @entity3 has always experimented with alternative forms of programming , " said @entity171			2
" i believe they were running ' @entity217 ' in ( ' @entity213 's ' ) slot			0
here 's something different and irreverent , and the rights were cheap			0
when @entity222 ( @entity153 ' creator ) came on the scene , it was pure genius at the time			0
" @entity3 recently announced that " @entity153 " are returning to the network in some form : can " @entity155 " be far behind ? two other memorable shows that were launched off the success of " @entity153 " in the 1990s were " @entity230 " and " @entity231 , " both series with tremendous appeal among hardcore comic book and animation fans			1
" ' @entity231 ' was one of the best comic book adaptations ever made			0
all of that kind of stuff has been a great part of @entity3 's history , " said @entity237 , editor of @entity3 's @entity238 , a blog devoted to comic books and comic book adaptations			1
@entity237 has been in charge of the blog nearly from its inception almost 2Â½ years ago			0
" what 's been amazing has been the ability to give comic books and creators the same level of promotion and attention that you do the actors and directors , " he said			0
in just these last couple of years , @entity237 has seen a change in the way comic books have been accepted			0
" i can actually have conversations with significantly more people about ' @entity264 ' and people will actually know what i 'm talking about , " he said			0
" i love that i can go on the subway , and people are reading ' @entity269			0
' " @entity237 said that the success of @entity238 shows that " this audience is actually important , " and he sees @entity3 having recognized that as well with " @entity10 as @entity1			1
" " ( @entity3 was ) able to take fan culture and market a show specifically to it , " said @entity98			1
" if you tap into the market of people at fan conventions , they 're really loyal to an entertainment product when you market it to them			0
" @entity98 also pointed out , " because it 's now being put on @entity3 , teenagers are seeing it as more acceptable			2
i 'm surprised how many kids come up to me and introduce themselves as geeks			0

@entity3 's " @entity10 as @entity1 , " about a self - described nerd , has taken off on @entity38
unique to this @entity3 show is controversy on @entity1 's " nerd cred "
@entity3 's popular series " @entity155 , " which started in 1997 , is an inspiration for @entity11
@entity3 's embrace of nerd culture reflects culture as a whole
