-- the mainstream media -- you know who you are -- are rooting for immigration reform			1
they like the idea of doing something to accommodate the country 's 11 million undocumented immigrants , who , despite conservative rhetoric to the contrary , were never going to be banished			0
they swoon over the kind of bipartisanship that brings together @entity16 and @entity17 on the one hand and @entity19 and @entity20 on the other			1
they believe the @entity23 needs to moderate its harsh rhetoric about immigrants -- if only to salvage its political future -- and are welcoming the @entity23 's new realism			1
but is that enthusiasm causing media organizations to overestimate the prospects for reform ? watch : @entity32 plays defense over @entity33 on ' @entity35 ' any bill still must pass the @entity37 , which has been a graveyard for numerous @entity19 reforms			1
the @entity40 has always been a place where top lawmakers reach across the aisle more easily than in the polarized @entity37 , as was evident during the fiscal cliff debacle			1
and there are conservative groups determined to derail any path toward citizenship , which they view as amnesty			0
it 's not that journalists are acting as cheerleaders for the emerging plan			0
but when the media have qualms about an issue , they couch it as being " controversial " and " risky " ( say , @entity59 's plan to privatize @entity60 )			2
opinion : immigrant - can we trust @entity19 ? by contrast , look at the way the president 's immigration speech in @entity68 was covered : the @entity69 : " seizing on a groundswell of support for rewriting the nation 's immigration laws ... " the @entity79 : " @entity19 added to momentum on @entity75 in favor of an overhaul of the nation 's immigration laws ... " we saw the same supportive approach when the @entity81 lifted a ban on women serving in front - line combat positions , which , despite some conservative opposition , was greeted with favorable features that largely depicted the move as long overdue			1
watch : should n.y. times have censored company name over the @entity90 ? as with many perpetual @entity95 disputes , the contours of a common - sense compromise on immigration have been clear for some time			2
the right wants tougher border enforcement and employer verification procedures			0
the left wants undocumented immigrants taken out of the " shadows , " as @entity19 put it , and given a chance to become openly productive members of society			1
the key are the tradeoffs			0
how long would a path to citizenship take ? are fines and back taxes required ? how do we ensure that those who broke the law do n't get an unfair advantage over legal applicants ? i do n't argue with the standard political analysis that the moment may be ripe for immigration reform			1
watch : media seize on @entity122 of @entity124 ' testimony @entity125 , who talked about wanting immigrants to " self - deport , " got clobbered among @entity128 voters			2
the @entity23 has lost the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections			1
@entity131 , the @entity132 commentator , says he has " evolved " on the issue , and he 's not alone			0
the conservative media may be a bellwether here			0
after @entity19 's tuesday speech , @entity131 's leadoff guest was @entity138 , the former @entity59 lieutenant who favors the @entity40 compromise			2
and when @entity17 , the @entity140 senator and son of @entity143 immigrants , called in to @entity145 's show , the host -- while criticizing @entity19 -- told him , " what you are doing is admirable and noteworthy			2
" watch : @entity150 10 : is it a hit or all thumbs ? but illegal immigration remains a divisive subject that still arouses visceral opposition among some @entity157			1
@entity75 is a place where partisan maneuvering can push the government to the brink of default			0
and as @entity59 learned in his second term , hammering out a compromise on such a volatile issue is maddeningly elusive			0
perhaps the election changed the landscape and both parties will find a way to compromise			0
in the meantime , it might be wise to take the upbeat media coverage with a healthy dose of skepticism			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2
