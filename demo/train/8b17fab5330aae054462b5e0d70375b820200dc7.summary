-- you 've never heard of @entity2 , but it definitely knows you			0
the @entity5 's top - secret program essentially makes available everything you 've ever done on the @entity7 — browsing history , searches , content of your emails , online chats , even your metadata — all at the tap of the keyboard			1
the @entity16 exposed the program on wednesday in a follow - up piece to its groundbreaking report on the @entity5 's surveillance practices			1
shortly after publication , @entity21 , a 29 - year - old former @entity22 employee who worked for the @entity5 for four years , came forward as the source			1
this latest revelation comes from @entity2 training materials , which @entity21 also provided to @entity16			1
the @entity5 sums up the program best : @entity2 is its " widest reaching " system for developing intelligence from the @entity7			2
the program gives analysts the ability to search through the entire database of your information without any prior authorization — no warrant , no court clearance , no signature on a dotted line			1
an analyst must simply complete a simple onscreen form , and seconds later , your online history is no longer private			0
the agency claims that @entity2 covers " nearly everything a typical user does on the @entity7			0
" as @entity16 points out , this program crystallizes one of @entity21 's most infamous admissions from his video interview on june 10 : " i , sitting at my desk , " said @entity21 , could " wiretap anyone , from you or your accountant , to a federal judge or even the president , if i had a personal email			1
" while @entity60 officials denied this claim , the @entity2 program , as the public understands it , proves @entity21 's point			1
the law requires the @entity5 to obtain @entity67 warrants on @entity60 citizens , but this is pushed aside for @entity60 with foreign targets — and this program gives the @entity5 the technology to do so			1
the training materials claim @entity2 assisted in capturing 300 terrorists by 2008			1
the @entity16 article breaks down how the program works with each activity , from email monitoring to chats and browsing history , and includes screenshots from the training materials			1
the @entity16 reached out to the @entity5 for comment prior to publication			2
the agency defended the program , stressing that it was only used to legally obtain information about " legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests			2
" " @entity2 is used as a part of @entity5 's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system , " the agency said in its response			1
" allegations of widespread , unchecked analyst access to @entity5 collection data are simply not true			0
access to @entity2 , as well as all of @entity5 's analytic tools , is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks ...			2
" in addition , there are multiple technical , manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring			0
every search by an @entity5 analyst is fully auditable , to ensure that they are proper and within the law			0
these types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully -- to defend the nation and to protect @entity60 and allied troops abroad			0
" @entity2 is the second black mark on the @entity5 's record in the past few weeks			0
the @entity16 's first story uncovered @entity128 , a highly controversial surveillance program that reportedly allows the security agency to access the servers of major internet organizations including @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 , among others			0
@entity21 's information led to a public outcry for transparency , and the @entity60 government pushed to declassify more information about @entity128 in an effort to paint a clearer picture about the program			2
@entity21 has been charged with espionage			0
he is currently holed up in the transit area of @entity152 's @entity151 while his request for asylum is under review by @entity157 immigration authorities , according to @entity21 's lawyer			0
