-- when i saw these words on @entity3 , i could n't help but put down my tablet : " they say the smallest coffins are the heaviest to carry			2
" they weigh heaviest upon the heart			0
first the @entity11 attack monday , then all too soon there came the school killings tuesday -- 145 people , 132 of them children -- in @entity15 , @entity16			1
there is n't enough time to grieve			0
to spend one minute of silence in honor of each of the lives lost would take more than two hours			1
the average life expectancy for men in @entity16 is about 66 years			0
these children killed at their school had some 50 years of life stolen from them â € ” life that will never be lived			1
think back on the last year			0
what did you accomplish ? how many times did you laugh ? how many act of kindness did you bring into the world ? think on all you did			0
think of what could have been if these children had lived â € ” of how each of their lives could have changed the world			1
it takes but one person , one moment , one conviction , to start a ripple of change			0
because they ca n't , we must			0
those stolen lifetimes deserve fulfillment			0
those children 's lives can still change the world			1
but it requires us to be called from despair to action			1
although their deaths are senseless and tragic , their potential lives can unfold through us			1
the smallest coffins are the heaviest , but living for the child lightens our hearts			0
it is easy to fall into despair thinking about all that is wrong with the world			2
the joys seems so small in comparison			0
internet videos of cats riding @entity72 just ca n't compete with a father talking about how his dead 13 - year - old son had wanted to be a pilot			0
how do we not yield to despair ? action is my antidote			1
the @entity82 attacked a school -- and earlier had shot @entity84 , an education activist -- because they are scared			1
they fear the potential of education to change the world , and move beyond them			2
education is the light that fights their darkness			2
it is up to us			0
the horror of their methods only redoubles our commitment to spreading the light			0
we know education is a human right and an unstoppable force			2
we can use our grief to activate and motivate us , to work so even more children are educated , to ensure that these child killings are the last throes of the @entity82 's reign of terror			1
the question becomes : how ? not long after the devastating news of the attack , i began to see a growing online community , started in large party by people of @entity16 descent across the world , looking for ways to help those in need in			1
each is seeking ways to honor those murdered in @entity15			2

if you are not a student , you can connect with your local university and offer to support the team working for early childhood education in urban slums			1
you have something to offer â € ” maybe you bake fantastic cookies , or provide expertise in financial modeling , or simply ask good questions			0
each skill , no matter how modest you feel it is , is useful to the students			2
we 're a world away from @entity16 in geography , but not in sentiment			0
we mourn with the parents as one people			0
now , we must act as one people .			0
