-- it 's not a good week to be a celebrity cell phone			1
but before we even begin to dive into that world , let 's go into a different preventive exercise that you 'll thank me for later : take your cell phone out			1
go into the media library that stores your photos			2
among the pics of your pet and that amazing plate of spaghetti from that fancy dinner , find the incriminating ones you would n't want a soul seeing			0
do the same with text messages			0
now we can carry on with a feeling of safety while immersing ourselves deeper into the story at hand			0
on wednesday , two of @entity28 's hottest young stars -- @entity29 and @entity30 -- reportedly found themselves at the center of a cell phone hacking scandal that is said to have eventually made its way all the way to the @entity36			1
the @entity36 could not confirm the name of specific hacking victims , and a representative said in a statement that " the @entity36 is investigating the person or group responsible for computer intrusions of high - profile figures , but due to it being an ongoing investigation , we 're not at liberty to confirm specific victims or the number of victims			0
" neither @entity29 nor @entity30 has confirmed that their phones have been hacked			1
for @entity29 , alleged nude photos zoomed across the internet after they were allegedly stolen from her cell phone			1
and while there is supposedly only one photo of @entity30 taken from her phone , it 's the alleged photos and texts to and from @entity61 that are causing a stir			1
@entity30 and @entity61 had definite on - screen chemistry in " @entity67 , " a film about , well , friends who sleep together			1
pretty much anyone with knowledge of @entity28 or celebrities thought something was going on there			0
with every media interview , the two joked and feigned a flirty relationship that raised eyebrows			0
then , the media blitz ended , @entity61 was spotted again with ex @entity78 , and that was that			2
that was until wednesday , when reports of alleged stolen cell phone photos from @entity30 ' phone reportedly of @entity61 -- one where he 's said to have a pair of underwear on his head -- started surfacing			1
as of early thursday , said photos -- if they actually exist -- had not yet surfaced			2
in unrelated , but still relevant , cell phone hacking news , @entity89 for the first time opened up this week about how she was a victim of the massive @entity94 phone hacking scandal that invaded the lives and communications of several celebrities , politicians and families of murder victims			1
when stories began hitting newsstands that clearly no one could possibly know about aside from @entity89 and her closest confidants , she said on " today , " she became " incredibly paranoid " because she felt " everything is compromised enormously			0
... it had a huge impact on relationships , friendships and my career			0
" while @entity89 's case is far different from the alleged cases of @entity29 and @entity30 , all of this hacking raises the question : how can situations like this be prevented ? here are a few suggestions , ideas and thoughts * that can help not only the celebrities involved , but , in one scenario , might also aid our struggling economy			1
( and before you let loose in the comments , be aware that the tongue was firmly in the cheek when these were written			0
) : â – build a government - run celebrity cell phone network : just like you and me , celebrities have cell phone contracts with the same old protections of non-celebs			1
well , they ( clearly ) need better mobile security			0
so , take whatever cell phone system the @entity141 , @entity36 and military operate on -- with all of the necessary security measures in place -- build an offshoot version of it only for celebrities , and charge them an exorbitant amount of money each month for it			1
in fact , charge them based on how scandalous the content on the phone is			2
the more nude pics or salacious texts you have , the higher your monthly rate			2
the money goes straight to the government , their nude photos stay safe , and our national debt just got lessened			1
@entity165 ! @entity165 ! â – walkie - talkies and @entity167 : if the technology of today makes it easy for scandals of this nature to occur , people of importance should turn back the clock and embrace the old school			0
trouble ensues when your phone doubles as a portable hard drive for photos and other potential red flags			2
a walkie - talkie does n't			0
hey , get a beeper while you 're at it			0
the worst thing that can happen there is someone texts you " 58008			0
" â – make cell phone hacks an act of terrorism : somewhere , the hacker behind the celebrity stings is laughing and living it up after exposing the lives of people in the spotlight			1
one surefire way to stop him / her and 99 % of the others from trying to continue the art of the hack ? those so - called " enhanced interrogation " techniques			0
answer this : would you post a nude photo of someone if it meant potentially being waterboarded and slapped repeatedly ? did n't think so			2
* or just do n't take / have / send things like this on your phone .			2
