-- while lying on a thin mattress a few months ago , nursing the symptoms of dengue fever , i watched a huntsman spider leap off of the wall of my wooden shack and onto a hapless cockroach , which the spider dragged away and devoured			0
i was serving as a @entity11 volunteer in the rural eastern part of the @entity13			1
but the spider 's ambush -- which gave new meaning to the word " insecticide " -- brought me back to another remote corner of the globe , @entity21 , where i had served in my other beloved corps : the @entity23			1
ambushes -- by @entity26 insurgents rather than hairy spiders -- were regular occurrences in southern @entity21			0
as a @entity23 officer , i made two deployments there , the second of which was spent testing , distributing , and fine - tuning equipment designed to foil the remote - control bombs the @entity26 used to ambush us			2
then , in 2011 , my active service ended , i turned in my rifle and i joined the @entity11 , where i spent two years building composting latrines in @entity13 communities that lacked access to basic sanitation			1
i completed my service this month and returned to the @entity45 ( i got over the dengue fever just fine )			1
when you join the @entity23 or the @entity11 , much less both , you often have some explaining to do			1
so , on this @entity48 , permit me to reflect here on the reasons people serve and to describe some of the common threads between these two special @entity45 institutions			1
you might be surprised to hear that the goals of the @entity23 and the @entity11 , and the ideals of the volunteers who join them , overlap			1
you might also be surprised to learn that the @entity11 has its own legacy of sacrifice , with more of its volunteers killed on the job than @entity63 officers			1
@entity23 operate as a team , in a strictly defined hierarchy			2
@entity11 service is largely an individual effort , and volunteers can go for months without being heard from by staff			1
@entity11 training includes learning to teach kids simple science experiments			2
@entity23 training includes learning the proper technique for choking someone to death			2
the essence of the @entity11 mission is to promote understanding between @entity45 volunteers and the people they serve			1
the @entity23 mission is to win our nation 's battles			2
but to say the two organizations are opposites would be erroneous			0
the book that inspired president @entity89 to launch the @entity11 was the 1958 novel called " @entity91			2
" i was actually assigned to read it by the @entity23 , since its practical advice on quelling insurgencies was correctly deemed relevant to the counterinsurgency wars we were now fighting in @entity99 and @entity21			2
i saw @entity23 approach problems in @entity21 as though they were characters in that novel -- or @entity11 volunteers			1
@entity103 , a young infantryman in our area of responsibility , won over local farmers by spontaneously shedding his equipment and helping them dig irrigation ditches one day while on patrol			0
@entity103 , who 'd taught himself @entity112 using an mp3 player , chatted amiably with the local men he encountered			0
the respect he showed them helped to win their support in our fight against the @entity26			0
while nation - building under fire certainly is n't a @entity11 mission , i saw enterprising @entity11 volunteers make a deep impact on the communities where they were invited to serve			1
@entity127 was assigned to work on a waste - management project in a @entity13 migrant farm worker community			0
it soon became apparent to her that this project would fail			0
rather than move to a different community or continue slaving on a doomed effort , she identified a more serious problem that she would n't have seen if she had n't gotten to know this community in the first place			0
numerous locally born kids were refused access to education because of their @entity141 descent , denied a basic right that they were legally owed			0
@entity127 learned to help people negotiate a discriminatory government bureaucracy , ultimately winning documentation for dozens of community members and helping them achieve access to public high schools and a shot at a better living			0
the @entity23 and @entity11 volunteers with whom i served demonstrated more ingenuity , perseverance , and guts than any other group of people i 've known			1
they also possessed a surplus of something that is vanishing from many other parts of @entity45 life : humility			2
countless @entity23 i know had put off careers in business , finance and law to play small , almost anonymous parts in tedious and dangerous places			2
sometimes the greatest personal achievement was looking out for fellow @entity23 by training them extra hard or jolting them from their sense of complacency in the final weeks of a deployment			0
those sorts of achievements do n't always make for sexy copy on a resume , but they are the achievements that can be savored the longest because they resulted in lives saved			0
similarly , many of the @entity11 volunteers i served with gave up good jobs -- as engineers , teachers , it professionals -- to leave home for a couple of years and find the enduring fulfillment that comes from leaving your comfort zone and improving the lives of strangers you have grown to know better than your neighbors back home			1
while nothing compares to the risks our servicemen and women take in combat , the @entity11 is n't exactly a walk to the local playground			1
since its inception in 1961 , the @entity11 has lost at least 287 volunteers to disease , road accidents , crime , and other hazards in their host countries			1
that 's more than twice the number of fallen @entity63 officers , whose sacrifices are properly commemorated by stars etched into @entity215 inside their headquarters			0
@entity89 , shortly after taking office , spoke of an " immense reservoir " of @entity45 men and women " anxious to sacrifice their energies and time and toil to the cause of world peace and human progress			0
" to see many of the best people from that reservoir -- the ones who stopped dreaming of their potential to serve and took real action -- take a look at those volunteers in the @entity23 and the @entity11			1
i really believe you can find the best of @entity239 s youth serving in each of these organizations			0
and neither organization squanders that resource			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			0

will @entity245 joined @entity11 after his active service in @entity23 ended
he found the two organizations have much in common despite clear differences
@entity11 volunteers take risks to serve @entity45 and help struggling people , he says
