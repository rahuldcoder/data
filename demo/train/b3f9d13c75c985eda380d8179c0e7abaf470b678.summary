the amazing escape of three @entity2 women -- @entity3 , @entity3 , and @entity3 -- exploded into the media amid sordid back stories of their captivity and gave life yet again to my own dark memories of captivity and despair			1
at age 13 , i , too , became the helpless victim of a sexually depraved monster , a vicious @entity16 predator who actively groomed me			1
luring me from my home , he abducted me to @entity18 where i was held captive in his basement dungeon			1
for days , i was raped , beaten and tortured , and like an animal , chained to the floor by a locking dog collar			1
my abductor shared my degradation via streaming video , boasting online about the young girl he had taken to be his sex slave			1
it was this very brazenness that would lead to my rescue , as one recipient of the live broadcast , afraid of his own involvement in the crime , scoured the newspaper and found my @entity35 missing person flier			1
seeing that my family and the @entity39 were searching for me , he used a pay phone to contact authorities			1
this led the @entity39 to where i was being imprisoned			1
the chain was cut from my neck ; i was set free and gifted with a second chance at life			2
had that call not been made , or had the investigation taken only a bit longer , the monster would have most likely murdered me			2
sadly , 74 % of stranger - abducted children will be killed within the first three hours			1
abused but alive : lessons from survivors though my rescue was miraculous , recovery and re-assimilation has been difficult			1
despite this , at 14 , after an all - too - brief period of healing , i began to speak out and share my story with students , parents , teachers , law enforcement -- anybody who would listen			2
i came to realize that other children need not suffer my traumatic experience , and so the " @entity68 " was born			2
continuing my mission , i 've joined @entity70 to raise awareness of , and effect change for , issues such as @entity16 safety , missing persons , human trafficking and child safety awareness education			2
i was attending an @entity79 roundtable in @entity80 when news broke of the @entity2 rescue			1
few have had positive outcomes ; their loved ones have been recovered deceased or not at all			2
those whose children have yet to be recovered are searching tirelessly , proclaiming that they will never give up			2
i watched their faces light up as they heard the news			0
you could almost hear each of them say , " that could be my child ! " these women are unbelievably lucky to have been pulled from the hell they were suffering and given another chance			1
they are excited to be back with their families and / or loved ones and everything is moving so quickly that their pain and trauma may be eclipsed by their joy			0
unfortunately , this is likely to be short - lived			0
the vast majority of those who have survived a traumatic experience suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder			0
nightmares , flashbacks , an inability to be in large crowds , hypervigilance , etc. , may become a part of their daily lives			0
it 's important for those around them to be sensitive and to allow them to express their pain			0
letter from a kidnapping survivor additionally , people must also temper their questioning of the events that unfolded while the girls were missing			0
it is their story and their choice whether to share it			0
they do not owe that to the world			0
survivors , aware of the agonies their families have endured , may feel the need to appear to be " fine " because they do not want to add to their loved ones ' grief			0
this is one of the many reasons counseling is vital for healthy mental well - being , as it provides a forum in which to speak freely without concern for the reaction of others			0
@entity151 , for each of us , is an ongoing process			0
i still have days where i suffer from @entity154 , but they are becoming less frequent			1
traumas do n't simply vanish , but we can definitely choose to fill our lives with positive experiences as time goes on			0
what people should take from this story is a message of hope			0
we must never give up hope that any child , whatever the circumstances , will be rescued and returned safely home			1
@entity3 , @entity3 and @entity3 , you have so many wonderful things in store for you			0
only those of us who have experienced the terror of threatened captivity may truly appreciate the hero you became as you seized that chance of escape , @entity3			0
welcome home , heroes .			1

@entity182 was abducted at age 13 and taken to @entity18
someone who saw a live video stream *alerted* authorities and she was rescued
the three @entity2 women will likely face @entity154 in their recovery , she says
@entity182 *salutes* all three women as heroes
