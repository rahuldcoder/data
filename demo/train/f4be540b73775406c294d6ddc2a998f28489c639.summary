" @entity1 is said to have frequently directed a racial term at @entity11 's @entity10 during matches in the @entity14 top flight			1
@entity10 , who has spent this season on loan at @entity18 club @entity17 , claimed in an interview with a @entity21 magazine that @entity1 repeatedly called him " negro " ( meaning black )			1

@entity29 was banned for eight matches and fined £ 40,000 ( $ 64,330 )			0
