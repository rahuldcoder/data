-- i 'm looking forward to thursday night 's installment of @entity0 's " the @entity3 " with some trepidation			1
true , it 's another excellent installment in the series			2
capturing the highlights and essence of a decade , especially one as turbulent and historically significant as the ' 60s , is not easy			2
given the controversial nature of many of the events -- at the time and even today -- and given how much influence some of those movements and events still exert , the task of putting together even a multipart series is daunting			2
thursday 's episode will cover the 1968 assassinations of the rev. @entity20 , on april 4 , and of @entity21 , on june 5			1
other episodes will cover the beginnings of the gay rights movement -- the @entity26 riots -- and the emergence of the women 's rights movement			1
those events changed my life , immediately			1
those movements changed the way i saw the world , eventually			1
i was born on december 15 , 1959 -- the cusp of the ' 60s			2
as the baby boomers came of age , or at least entered their teens , i went from infancy , to being a toddler , to childhood			0
i have no direct memories of the @entity42 , @entity44 's assassination , the @entity45 coming to @entity46 , or the buildup of the @entity48			2
" @entity53 " was my dream -- it still is , of course -- but i learned the words in reruns			0
but i was old enough to be affected directly by the events in this episode			2
as i wrote in " @entity56 , " i grew up on april 4 , 1968 , when @entity20 was shot			1
i 'd been active in neighborhood politics even before , but that night , at 9 years old , i joined the civil rights movement			1
when @entity21 was assassinated two months later , we prayed			1
i remember my anger , my fear , my determination			0
i remember talking to everyone i trusted , everyone i thought wise			0
the times indeed were changing , but nobody knew what they were changing into			0
our challenge was channeling anger into action , transforming despair into determination , using defeat to become more disciplined			0
i learned early it 's a lifetime challenge			2
while the civil rights movement was woven into my childhood , it took a bit longer for me to become aware of what was then called the women 's liberation movement			1
of course , the fight for equality goes back into the 19th century , even to founders like @entity87			0
but it was in 1968 that " women 's lib " became an official part of the societal shift , the tide of change toward economic , social and legal equality			1
( the name " women 's liberation " came from a nationally circulated newsletter that came out of @entity98			1
) it was a time of consciousness - raising , and women refused to be left out			2
in 1968 , 100 women protested the @entity104 beauty pageant			1
in 1972 , @entity105 published the first issue of @entity107 , but the seeds had been sown earlier			0
women like @entity105 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 -- they showed a young girl just entering her teens that being a woman was n't a political handicap , but an asset			0
the gay rights movement also started in the late ' 60s , but it had the farthest to go			1
like the push for women 's equality , it actually started earlier			1
it just found its voice , following the footsteps of the civil rights and women 's rights movements			1
the impetus was the @entity26 riots			0
when police raided the @entity134 in @entity135 on june 28 , 1969 , it sent shock waves through the gay and lesbian community			0
police lost control of the situation , people rioted , and more protests occurred the next night , and again on other nights			0
village residents began organizing , trying to establish places where gays and lesbians could be open without harassment or arrest			0
gaining acceptance by other activist groups was slow			0
getting respect and equal treatment before the law was slow			0
but where we are today began then			0
and if we want to have an honest discussion about where we are , and where we can and should go , we need to understand the ' 60s a lot better than we do			1
i hope you 'll tune in .			0

events in " the @entity3 " changed the world and the way @entity170 saw it
@entity20 , @entity21 killed in 1968 . @entity170 was only 9 but joined the civil rights movement
civil rights , women 's rights , gay rights , all came into their own in the ' 60s
to discuss who we are and where we can go , we need to understand the ' 60s
