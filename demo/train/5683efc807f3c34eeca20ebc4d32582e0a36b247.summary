-- three @entity2 prison officials have been charged with murder after three imprisoned protesters were beaten to death in the aftermath of the country 's disputed presidential election , @entity2 media reported saturday			1
@entity2 's military court announced that nearly two dozen officials from @entity16 's @entity15 prison were indicted ; of those , there is enough evidence to prosecute 12 , @entity2 's semi-official @entity11 news agency reported			1
three were charged with premeditated murder for participating in the beatings ; nine will face other unspecified charges			1
the judiciary did not identify the defendants			2
@entity15 officials initially said that @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 died of meningitis , according to the judiciary			1
however , a coroner 's reported indicated that the three were severely beaten behind bars by prison personnel , and died from their injuries			1
the judiciary also blamed the prison 's medical shortcomings and sub-par conditions as factors in the men 's deaths			1
@entity2 media first reported the three protesters ' deaths nearly two weeks after ayatollah @entity44 , @entity2 's supreme leader , ordered the @entity15 facility shut down amid reports of prisoner mistreatment			1
in the wake of the deaths , authorities fired and arrested @entity15 's warden			1
the three protesters were among some 4,000 people arrested in connection with protests following the june 12 presidential election			1
thousands of @entity2 demonstrated against the official result of the vote , which re-elected hardline president @entity59			0
the government said he won by a landslide , but his opponents accused officials of rigging the results			2
the opposition to the results and the mass arrests were a blow to @entity2 's @entity71 leadership			2
further tarnishing the image of the government 's handling of the demonstrations was the identification of 72 protesters killed during the unrest , released by @entity2 reformist web site @entity79 in september			1
putting the prison officials on trial is an attempt by the government to build credibility and maintain public order , some scholars say			1
but , they argue , it 's a political move that will likely fail			0
" @entity44 will be the loser no matter what happens , " said @entity88 , a research fellow at the @entity90 - based @entity89 who has researched the relationship between @entity2 civilians and the @entity94			0
" does it make him more credible in the eyes of the government -- no , i do n't think so			0
" he said the guards would likely be prosecuted in a " show trial , " noting that the @entity2 government has orchestrated such trials in the past by giving in to public demands for accountability , but without holding high - ranking officials responsible for their roles in any wrongdoing			0
another expert described the defendants as " scapegoats			2
" " even if they are some lowly soldier or some lowly revolutionary guard who was doing this , it was obviously under the order of higher - ups , " said @entity114 , director of @entity2 studies at @entity116			0
amid earlier reports of prisoner mistreatment at @entity15 , @entity44 ordered the facility shut down			2
nearly two weeks later , @entity2 media reported the deaths of the protesters			2
in the wake of the deaths , authorities fired and arrested @entity15 's warden			1
when gen. @entity135 , commander of @entity2 's security forces , announced the arrest of the warden , he also said no one died at @entity15 from physical abuse and that the inmates died from illnesses			1
the coroner later disputed that claim			0
despite earlier attempts by high - ranking @entity2 officials to dispute allegations of abuse of detained protesters , government officials have also promised to investigate the supposed cases			2
such a dichotomy reflects @entity44 's desire to be both " feared and loved , " @entity88 said			0
" the supreme leader and the regime want to show they are powerful and ca n't be shaken , " he said , " and , on the other hand , they do n't want to accept responsibility			0
" in august , @entity44 met with @entity25 's father , @entity160 , vowing that " the system has no intention to forgive or be courteous to any wrongdoers			0
" the bereaved father announced on @entity44 's web site in september that he was satisfied with how the government was handling the case			0
but the trial will not help @entity44 's relationship with the public , @entity88 said			0
" regardless of what the father says or does not say , the person responsible is @entity44 , " @entity88 said			0
" whatever he does , he has lost this case			0
