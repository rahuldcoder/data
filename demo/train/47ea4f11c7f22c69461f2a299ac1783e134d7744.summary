" @entity54 art enfant terrible @entity55 -- famous for pickling dead animals in formaldehyde -- also had a piece up for sale , capturing the beauty of @entity7 in a spin painting which sold for $ 562,000			1
the art of football many members of football 's elite are collectors of art -- @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , to name a few -- and the " beautiful game " serves as inspiration to a host of artists across the globe			2
the artworks take wildly varying forms , from bright abstract compositions to painstaking tapestries			0
while @entity86 's " @entity85 , " comprised of blobs of colors splashed liberally across the canvas , might look like it was done by somebody who got carried away with paint samples , it actually depicts one of the first ever football games to be played under floodlights in @entity92 1952			2
@entity93 was so inspired by what he saw that he immediately went home and stayed up the whole night to create this masterpiece worth millions , attracting interest in a separate @entity24 's auction			1
@entity100 's ancient @entity99 themed " portrait of @entity104 as @entity105 " goes as far as to liken @entity7 's @entity13 teammate to a god			1
" these people are divas -- but not in a negative sense , they 're icons and they represent their own sport but they represent the universe of financial interest , they advertise things ... for me they are the @entity114 answers to @entity115 , " @entity100 told @entity1			2
the @entity116 believes football clubs have more in common with galleries than you might think			0
" people do n't like to admit it but you know , the biggest galleries are like the biggest football clubs , and they swap athletes ... they are fabled , " explains @entity100			0
" there 's always a hot name -- there 's a young one that everybody 's eyes are on , then everybody changes their mind			2
" @entity100 also argues that the world 's fascination with football could be because the sport represents the pursuit of perfection and beauty			1
" in different degrees we are all influenced by the need or the desire of being more perfect , more beautiful			0
" the collection also demonstrates football art can provide a dialogue for important social issues			0
@entity147 's " @entity155 " shows a @entity149 woman holding a football aloft , challenging the limits that religion and tradition can place on women			2
" i do feel excluded out of my society -- women are perpetual minors in my @entity149 , " @entity156 told @entity1			0
" the woman in that picture is a young @entity149 woman who received a scholarship for high school through football , so she really did play very well -- obviously she does n't play it anymore because there is no league in the country			0
everybody appreciates a winning team			0
sportsmanship , and what it does to an individual , a group , a community is something that everybody should include in their structure , or the fabric of their social existence			0
" this has been especially true of the @entity182 , which had a gripping finale on sunday : " the @entity184 has gone through many years of struggle and civil war , and for them to win there was such a deep celebration within their country and beyond , " added @entity156			0
as the 1in11 auction shows , art really does have a place in football -- whether you 're a professional , an artist or a spectator			2
