it 's in the food we eat : in the cheese that shares chemical properties with bad breath and stinky feet and in the bread that is leavened by microbial excretions			1
it 's in nature : in the viruses that make us sick , in the monstrous shape of reptiles and deep - sea fish and in the terrible parasites that torment them			1
of course , we ourselves might be the greatest source of grossness			2
we carry it with us , in our blood and guts			2
anytime someone 's insides end up outside , you are definitely in the presence of the gross			1
it seems obvious that our repulsion from the gross is rooted in our fear of death			2
we may pretend that we are our own masters , but deep down we suspect we are really the victims of nature and fate			2
the things we spurn as gross are the things that rub that dismal knowledge in our face			2
5 ways @entity43 will surprise you but fear is only half the story			2
old medical devices may look like implements of torture , but they were used for healing			1
gruesome medical specimens show us the miraculous functioning of the human body			1
horrific germs and grotesque insects embody nature 's endless ingenuity , its ability to exploit any niche and fill the empty spaces with living things			1
if it 's true that the universe can be known in a grain of sand , then it can also be known through the gross -- and that 's much more entertaining than staring at a tiny bit of gravel			1
if you resist the impulse to flinch and take the gross on its own terms , you will unlock a universe of discovery and even enjoyment			0
here are seven of my favorite gross places in @entity81 to jump start your own journey of " grossological " discovery			0
hit the trail : 7 gorgeous hikes @entity86 , @entity87 the nation 's undisputed monarch of medical museums began with a donation from dr. @entity92 to the @entity93 in 1858			1
in 1912 , the enlarged collection was moved to its present location , where it continued to serve physicians as a pathological reference collection			0
today it is a monument to 19th - century medicine			1
its clubby , dark wood and brass interiors practically define the steampunk aesthetic			0
within the glass cases is a @entity104 of medical curiosities			1
@entity107 's alleged 50 - day bender ends badly there is a human skull collection ; examples of diseased organs , either preserved in jars or cast in wax models of remarkable delicacy			1
admittedly , the collection of teratological specimens ( mutants ) requires a strong stomach			1
but even the most sensitive can enjoy the @entity119 , a cabinet filled with more than 2,000 swallowed objects removed by a single laryngologist			1
there are also examples of tanned human skin , which has no medical value , but is totally cool			1
my personal favorite is the @entity128 , a woman whose body posthumously underwent complete saponification -- which means that all the fat in her body turned into soap			1
the museum is open daily , 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. @entity137 's @entity136 , @entity138 , @entity139 do n't be fooled by an ordinary looking mushroom			1
beneath it broods an ancient horror that has been growing quietly for thousands of years			0
a @entity138 cluster of @entity144 , or honey mushroom , is part of the world 's largest fungus , which engulfs 3.4 square miles -- that 's 2,200 acres -- of @entity139 's national parkland			1
this massive mushroom is estimated to weigh 7,567 to 35,000 tons , which would make it the largest living organism in the world			1
but that does n't sound nearly as gross as being the largest fungus			0
now for the letdown : the bulk of this behemoth resides underground in a stringy network of roots called a rhizomorph			0
the only visible traces are the mushrooms that sprout in the fall			0
they may not look like much but once you know their dark secret , you ca n't help but see them in a new , sinister way			0
the @entity175 website has more information about the fungus and its forest home			0
@entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 in this community of 1,800 souls , the dead outnumber the living 900 to 1			1
@entity180 's demographic imbalance is the result of its unofficial role as @entity190 's necropolis			1
this relationship started in 1900 , when land became so scarce in @entity190 that the @entity193 decided to remove all its dead and build on the decommissioned cemeteries			2
the dispossessed dead were transferred to new digs in @entity180 -- for a service charge of $ 10 a head			1
those whose next of kin could n't come up with the cash were less ceremoniously reinterred in collective , unmarked graves			0
with 73 % of its land zoned today for memorial parks , @entity180 is less a city than a network of roads connecting its many cemeteries			1
( even the number of cemeteries within city limits is debatable , although most sources place the count at 17			0
) the @entity215 offers cemetery tours by appointment , and members will be happy to show you the final resting places of @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 and other famous @entity81 who now call @entity180 home			1
perhaps this attraction is more morbid than gross , but let 's not split hairs : it 's a pleasant @entity230 - season outing in a beautiful part of the nation			1
@entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 how many medical museums are on the site of an old insane asylum ? built in 1897 , the @entity233 was the research wing of the @entity240 for the @entity241			2
physicians there studied the brains of deceased patients , trying to identify the physical causes of mental illness			0
some of the more colorful diagnoses they came up with include : pathological jealousy , @entity252 excitement , religious anxiety and a little - known ailment called " husband in @entity181			1
" a significant number of patients , however , suffered from general paresis , a neurological condition caused by advanced syphilis			0
today , the beautifully restored museum building is a perfect replica of a turn - of - the - century pathology laboratory			1
you can see a sampling of gruesome medical and autopsy tools in their native environment , but , of course , the grossest highlight is the human brain collection			1
this consists of some 80 samples , mostly sliced in cross section and preserved in glass slides , which display various neurological injuries			0
the @entity233 is open to the public thursday through saturday			0
@entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 some things seem universally gross , say , the smell of rotting flesh			0
other things elicit a variety of responses			0
old hair gives some people in intense case of the heebie - jeebies			2
@entity288 is not one of them			0
she is the proprietor of the nation 's only museum dedicated entirely to hair art. nearly forgotten today , hair craft was popular with @entity295 , who wove jewelry and decorative lace out of human hair			1
often these pieces were kept as mementos of dead or absent loved ones			2
sometimes successive generations would add to the lacework to create a genealogical record , much like a family bible			0
the hair museum has more than 2,000 items that reach back to the 17th century			1
creepy as you might find these pieces , you can not deny their artistry			0
the museum is open tuesday through saturday , 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 this unintended artificial lake is an expanse of tranquil water four miles around and tinted an impossible shade of rich cordovan red			2
as luminous and vast as the @entity315 sky above , it is a sight of unearthly , inhuman beauty			0
but it is undeniably gross			0
the secret to the @entity313 's beauty is pollution			2
for 27 years , it was the site of intensive strip mining , which removed more than a billion tons of earth and valuable ores			1
when mining ceased in 1982 , ground water began to rush into the pit , bringing with it an infusion of acids and toxic heavy metals			0
today the @entity313 is the crowning jewel in the nation 's largest contiguous federal superfund site			2
how dangerous is the pit ? back in 1995 , a flock of misdirected snow geese alit on its banks			0
the next morning , 342 were dead			2
remarkably enough , you can visit the pit			0
obviously kayaking and water skiing are out of the question			0
but there is an observation platform where you can watch at a safe distance			0
it 's open from march to november			2
for more information , go to www.visitmt.com and search for " @entity313			0
" @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 this library and private collection of weird art and antique medicine cum gallery and lecture space hosts occasional classes in anthropmorphic taxidermy			0
that 's the resurrected @entity369 craft of dressing dead animals in adorable little outfits and posing them in human activities			1
the bunny school houses and kitten croquet parties of a more genteel era , however , have been updated to mouse burlesque dancers , skateboarders and drunken poets			0
visits can be scheduled to the library by appointment .			0
