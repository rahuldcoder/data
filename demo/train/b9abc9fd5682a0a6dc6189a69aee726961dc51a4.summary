-- a few years ago , @entity1 was driving around @entity2 when he spotted a neon sign for a random storage facility			1
the red stick figures carrying yellow boxes glowed from the mundane building			0
it was like it was screaming out to him			0
@entity1 loved how a sign could go from ordinary and unremarkable during the day to " talking to you " at night			2
@entity14 's neon won over the frequent traveler , who has concluded the @entity16 has the best neon anywhere			1
" they have just enough peppered through the city where it just comes alive , " said @entity1 , a @entity19 - based headhunter			0
" i was so compelled by it that for two weeks i just drove around and took pictures of neon signs			1
" what 's disappointing for enthusiasts like @entity1 is that neon is dying			1
businesses are switching to cheaper , more energy - efficient led bulbs and municipal planning boards are zoning out neon to decrease the number of unsightly displays			1
" @entity36 spent most of its career in this country more hated than loved in terms of being banned and put under zoning ordinances , " said neon historian @entity35			1
" it 's an iconic part of the 20th century , but it 's been legislated out of existence in some places			2
there 's a vindictive attitude toward it			2
" neon lights were n't always losing ground			1
they were once in @entity52 's shoes , beating out an old mode of lighting			2
in 1902 , just a few years after neon gas was discovered by @entity59 chemists , @entity56 engineer @entity55 sent it coursing through electrified glass tubes , creating neon lighting			0
the new type of light quickly ousted incandescent bulbs , the former favorite of sign - makers			1
@entity55 started marketing neon signs in @entity69 and in the early 1920s came to @entity71 , where neon 's popularity exploded , said @entity35			1
in the 1930s , neon was everywhere in @entity71			1
in the beginning of the decade , shops saw the glowing lights as a novelty , though an expensive one , to keep them competitive			0
they were installed for big corporate chain retailers like car dealers			0
but by the end of the decade , big businesses had found cheaper alternatives			0
at that point , neon became associated with less desirable businesses , @entity35 said			0
think seedy hotels and sex shops			0
despite the connotation , neon continued to be a " powerhouse industry " from the ' 40s through the ' 60s , but began a steady decline in the 1970s as even small businesses found cheaper ways to advertise			1
some cities came to view the lighting as tacky and overly commercial			0
not many people would know now , but @entity102 was covered in neon until it became vilified			1
people said the signs were garish and distracted from the city 's natural beauty			2
" they 're outsized , outlandish , and outrageous			0
they 're desecrating our buildings , cluttering our streets , and -- this is the final indignity -- blocking our view of some of the greatest scenery in the world , " @entity109 columnist @entity108 wrote in 1966 , as quoted in a 2011 @entity109 article			0
it was n't just @entity102 turning off the neon			1
the @entity122 went from tens of thousands of signs in the ' 70s to just a few hundred across the five boroughs today , said @entity35 , author of " @entity126			0
" across the @entity71 , the use of neon signs saw another sharp dip in the late 2000s , according to a survey by trade magazine @entity131			1
signs were illuminated by 33 % neon and 23 % leds in 2007 , but the tables had turned by 2010			1
by then leds more than doubled the use of neon , 40 % to 18 %			2
in the last few years , even @entity141 , with its rows of iconic neon - lit streets , has started to turn to leds			1
despite its commercial decline , neon has still enjoyed periods of popularity as an art form , experts say			0
" it 's that color , it 's that light , " said @entity150 , an artist who started working with neon in the late ' 80s , and is now the director of the @entity154 in @entity2			2
" it 's kind of magical , even though it 's a mixture of a chemistry project and magic			0
" for @entity161 native and long - time neon fan @entity162 , the lighting is a message from another time			0
" i always loved neon because it was a representation of the future from the people of the past , " he said			0
" there 's something that 's just so romantic about dark and neon			2
it can be really sleazy or it can be really romantic			0
it 's a really adaptive light			0
" preserving neon and making people aware of it has become the mission of the @entity154 , as well as the other big museum in the @entity71 , the @entity180 in @entity181			1
the @entity2 museum started in the ' 80s , as signs were coming down around the city			0
@entity150 knows the museum ca n't possibly fit all the neon signs it saves , but collectors and enthusiasts have helped take in some of the larger signs			2
" making people aware of its unique history in @entity71 and the value of it has turned things around in @entity14 , " she said			2
" there are enough examples that have awakened developers to the value of neon signs on their buildings			1
now they want to put a neon sign on their buildings to give it that look			1

neon lights are *fading* as cities ban signs and switch to cheaper leds
@entity213 , @entity102 and @entity141 are examples of where neon is *disappearing* quickly
@entity36 's heyday in @entity71 was in the 1930s
have a favorite neon sign we missed ? share your photos with @entity224
