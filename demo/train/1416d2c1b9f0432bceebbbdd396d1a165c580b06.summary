-- it was the kind of experience i could n't make up			1
a few weeks ago , my husband and i were invited to a large dinner party			1
after we arrived , we were seated at a round table with four other couples			1
introductions were made , and glasses of wine were poured			1
kids and sports were discussed			1
then , out of the blue , one of the men at the table made an announcement			2
" @entity22 's wife writes @entity24 romances , " he said while smiling , almost as if i should be embarrassed that he divulged my secret			1
my husband squeezed my hand , told how i write inspirational romances and said he was proud of me			1
i picked up my fork , ready to dig into my salad and listen to everyone else talk			2
really , that 's what i do best			2
but then i realized everyone was staring at me			2
" you write religious books ? " one of the women asked			1
" about people in buggies ? " i nodded			2
and then came the million - dollar question : " why ? " of all the answers brewing inside of me , only one came to mind ; the one answer that still feels the best : it gives me joy and enriches my readers ' lives			1
well , that 's it in a nutshell , as one of my characters would say			2
i feel lucky to spend much of my days writing about people loving the @entity54 and falling in love at the same time			2
i do n't feel those two things are mutually exclusive			2
being a @entity57 is part of who i am , just like me being left - handed			2
it would be impossible to park my faith on the sidelines , pulling it out only on sundays when it 's time for church			1
i do n't think i 'm alone in this			0
several articles have appeared lately in the media about the popularity of inspirational romances			1
the @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 have noticed the popularity of inspirational fiction -- " bonnet romances " in particular			1
it 's become one of the most profitable industries in publishing			0
since i 'm a working writer , i 'm glad of that			0
but in my heart , i also see the need for this genre			0
in today 's society , it 's hard not to be blindsided by swearing , violence or suggestive language			0
things that used to be thought of as unmentionable are now on television and in movies , and of course , in books			1
there 's a large market for entertainment that pushes the envelope			0
i certainly do n't shield myself against all of this			0
but sometimes , it 's nice to know that there 's a haven for people who do n't necessarily want to spend their time around those elements			0
and that 's where the inspirational market comes in			0
my readers know if they pick up one of my novels , they wo n't be shocked by anything in its pages			1
furthermore , i work very hard to ensure that my characters will be spiritually challenged and lifted			0
i want my readers to believe in love and romance and maybe even @entity117 's grace by the time they read the last page			1
i enjoy @entity24 inspirational novels because they depict a lifestyle that is vastly different from mine			1
like a lot of other women my age , i 'm busy working , running to my children 's sporting events and doing a hundred other activities that seem to take up too much time and leave me exhausted			0
however , in my @entity24 - themed novels , the pace is slower			1
driving to town in a buggy means there 's time to look at the flowers on the side of the road , or to actually talk to the person you 're sitting next to			0
there 's a quiet appeal to a way of life that does n't involve computers , cell phones , traffic , radios or gps systems			0
in the @entity24 community , family and faith are integral to every decision -- and with that comes comfort			1
when i write about my characters spending the morning in prayer , passing an afternoon canning with friends or piecing a quilt for a charity auction , i wish i were doing those things , too			0
and when my characters speak with absolute certainty that the @entity54 is with them , i also yearn to feel that way			0
i feel fortunate to be able to spend my days writing inspirational fiction , and even talking about it to people at a dinner party			0
and though people were still smirking at me at the end of the dinner , i 'm hopeful that maybe one or two of them will pick up an inspirational novel from the shelves and give it a try			0
they might be pleasantly surprised .			0
