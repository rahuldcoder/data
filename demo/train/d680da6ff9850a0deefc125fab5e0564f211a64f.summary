has been around been around for decades , but it 's back in the transport spotlight amid a surge of interest from the @entity5 and @entity6			2
despite cuts to president @entity11 's original plan to spend $ 53 billion on @entity1 over the next 25 years , an ambitious scheme for @entity1 to connect @entity5 cities is still on the agenda			1
@entity6 has built more than 8,000 kilometers of high - speed rail lines in recent years and plans to spend over $ 400 billion on its program in the next five years , while the @entity15 is contemplating plans to extend its more modest @entity1 network			1
supporters of @entity1 often list environmental sustainability among its virtues			1
some argue it 's a greener alternative to car and air travel and see it as an easy win in weaning people of fossil fuels			1
but just how green is @entity1 ? two experts with different views give their opinions			1
dr. @entity32 is professor of urban studies and political science at @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , where he directs the @entity40			1
his latest book , co-authored with @entity42 , is " @entity43 : moving people and @entity45			2
" any debate about the future of high - speed rail must consider where this mobility option fits into the ' big picture ' of how transportation systems meet looming economic , energy and environmental challenges			2
in a world where 95 % of motorized mobility is currently fueled by oil , high - speed rail offers a proven means of reducing dependence on this increasingly problematic energy source			1
this value of using proven electric propulsion technology should not be underestimated when both the time and money to deploy energy alternatives are in short supply			2
in our recent book @entity43 , @entity42 and i documented the economic , environmental and political dividends to be gained from replacing the internal combustion engines powering today 's aircraft , cars , and motor vehicles with traction motors that can be powered by multiple energy sources delivered through the electric grid			1
since electricity is an energy carrier , it can be generated from a mix of sources that incorporate the growing share of geothermal , hydro , solar , and wind energy that will be produced in the years ahead			1
and because electric motors are three to four times more efficient than internal combustion engines , an immediate improvement will precede introducing renewable energy into transportation			2
grid - connected traction offers the only realistic option for significantly reducing oil use in transportation over the next 10 years			1
if such a shift does not begin during this decade , the risk of a global economic collapse and / or geo - political conflict over the world 's remaining oil reserves would become dangerously elevated			2
making a significant dent in transportation 's oil addiction within 10 years is sooner than fuel cells , biofuels , battery - electric vehicles and other alternative energy technologies will be ready to deliver change			1
biofuels that could power aircraft now cost hundreds of dollars per gallon to produce			0
batteries that a big enough charge to power vehicles between cities are still too big and expensive to make electric cars and buses affordable			1
but grid - connected electric trains have been operating at scale and across continents for over a century			0
and when the @entity124 introduced modern high - speed trains through their @entity126 , in 1964 , the utility of electric trains was greatly extended			0
since the 1980s , countries across @entity128 and @entity129 have been building new high - speed rail infrastructure to deploy electric mobility between major cities up to 1,000 kilometers apart			0
for intercity trips between 200 and 1,000 kilometers , high - speed trains have proven their success in drawing passengers out of both cars and planes , as well as meeting new travel demand with a much lower carbon footprint than driving or flying could have done			0
if we are serious about reducing oil 's considerable risks to global prosperity and sustainability , we will not miss the opportunity offered by high - speed rail to decrease transportation 's oil consumption sooner , rather than later			0
@entity149 is a campaigner for @entity150 , in its energy and climate team			1
he has a long track record of working on environmental issues , including a spell as transport campaigner for the environmental campaigning charity			0
across the world governments are looking to high speed rail to provide fast , modern transport systems fit for the 21st century			0
by the end of 2012 @entity6 is expected to have more high speed rail lines than the rest of the world combined , while president @entity11 aims to give 80 per cent of @entity5 access to fast rail travel within 25 years			0
but if governments want high speed rail to spearhead the drive towards a cleaner transport system they must look further than simply providing faster trains			0
the @entity15 is currently mulling over a high speed rail link between @entity174 and @entity175 , a city about 160 kilometers north - west of the capital			0
but according to official estimates , it 's unlikely to lead to significant carbon dioxide cuts -- and may even increase climate - changing emissions			0
so what 's stopping high speed rail being a major part of a greener transport future in @entity15 ? first there 's the electricity to power the trains			1
over two thirds of the world 's electricity comes from fossil fuels so until ( or unless ) power stations are weaned off fossil fuels , electric trains will still have a significant climate impact -- although rail travel is still better than flying or driving			1
secondly , will high speed rail entice people off the roads and short - haul flights ? @entity204 tgvs and the @entity206 rail link have succeeded , but official calculations estimate that only 16 per cent of anticipated passengers for the @entity174 to @entity175 line will have swapped from planes or cars			2
one of the main factors is cost			0
despite soaring fuel prices , motoring and flying are still expected to be cheaper than high speed rail			0
if faster rail travel is to become a realistic alternative it must be affordable too			2
the @entity15 's high speed rail link is expected to cost a whopping $ 54 billion			0
but living as we do in cash - strapped times there 's surely a strong case for investing some of that that money in less grandiose , but more effective , projects			0
perhaps some high speed rail money could be diverted to upgrade commuter and longer - distance services , making life easier and cheaper for ordinary passengers -- and making a bigger and fast contribution to cutting emissions			0
high speed rail can play a major role in tackling climate change around the world -- if it 's affordable , powered by clean energy and gets people out of their cars and off planes , we really will be speeding in the right direction .			1

@entity1 can significantly cut oil use in transport in next 10 years , says @entity32
he believes @entity1 can reduce oil use before alternative energy technologies are ready
if power stations use fossil fuels , @entity1 will still impact climate , says @entity149
@entity149 argues @entity1 must be made affordable to get people out of cars
