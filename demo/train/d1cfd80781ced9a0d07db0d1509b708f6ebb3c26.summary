-- @entity1 opposes @entity4 and @entity5 leaders ' calls for @entity7 president @entity6 to resign , @entity9 news agency reported friday , saying that the leader should get more time to implement reforms			1
the move by @entity1 counters efforts by leaders ratcheting up international pressure against a regime criticized for its brutal crackdown against protesters calling for reforms and the ouster of @entity6			1
" we do not support such calls , and we think that president @entity6 should be given time today to implement all of the declared reform processes , " a @entity1 @entity22 official told the nation 's @entity9 news agency			1
the @entity30 has previously said @entity6 had " lost legitimacy , " but resisted calling explicitly for his ouster until now			0
" the future of @entity7 must be determined by its people , but president @entity6 is standing in their way , " president @entity33 said in a statement thursday			1
" we have consistently said that president @entity6 must lead a democratic transition or get out of the way			2
for the sake of the @entity7 people , the time has come for president @entity6 to step aside			1
" the leaders of @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , the @entity48 and the @entity49 echoed @entity33 's demand			0
the refusal by @entity1 to go along with @entity4 and @entity5 leaders ' calls is a departure from its stance in june when prime minister @entity56 criticized the crackdown and called for pressure to be put on @entity7 to stop the violence			1
the @entity1 @entity22 official , according to @entity9 , said " what counts most is @entity6 's statement yesterday that they are stopping all military operations			1
" during a telephone call with @entity67 @entity66 ban ki - moon , @entity6 said military operations in the country had been halted			1
opposition protesters have refuted the claim , saying security forces have been arresting people and setting up checkpoints in and around cities			0
@entity1 also was encouraged with @entity7 's agreement to accept a humanitarian mission from the @entity67 into the country to look for the effects of the months - long military crackdown on anti-government protesters , the official told @entity9			1
the humanitarian mission will travel to @entity7 on saturday , and spend three to four days in the country , the @entity67 said			0
@entity7 ambassador @entity85 said @entity6 has issued 20 reforms since march that will lead toward democracy by the end of the year			2
" this is , after all , what the peaceful demonstrators are calling for , " he said the @entity22 official , according to @entity9 , said @entity6 has taken steps to implement a number of reforms , such as the adoption of " appropriate laws , " the announced amnesty for political prisoners and readiness to hold general elections before the end of the year			1
senior @entity4 officials , diplomats and members of the @entity7 opposition have argued that the next several weeks will be critical in terms of isolating @entity6 , strengthening sanctions against the regime and bolstering domestic opponents of the regime			2
the campaign against @entity7 's leadership , involving intense diplomatic outreach by secretary of state @entity114 and @entity33 , has been based on the one the @entity4 used in @entity115 , where the @entity4 administration built international consensus for the @entity119 mission to protect civilians			2
@entity4 and @entity5 authorities remain opposed to any military intervention in @entity7 -- a sharp contrast to their response to regime - sponsored violence in @entity115			0
" i do n't think anybody believes that is the desired course of action on @entity7 , " one senior administration official said thursday			0
@entity1 also has threatened to veto any @entity132 resolution condemning @entity7 that opens the door to international intervention			2
several @entity136 countries with traditionally close ties to @entity7 , including @entity138 and @entity139 , have been consulted in recent weeks , according to senior administration officials			0
meanwhile , a @entity67 fact - finding mission announced thursday it has found @entity7 guilty of multiple human rights violations , and indicated it may be time for the @entity143 to become involved			0
" the mission found a pattern of human rights violations that constitutes widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian population , which may amount to crimes against humanity , " the report said			0
@entity46 and other @entity5 countries are pushing for a @entity132 resolution condemning the @entity6 regime , but they are still facing stiff resistance from @entity1 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			2
the @entity4 is pushing for special session on @entity7 at the @entity162 in @entity163 as early as next week			0
@entity0 's @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
