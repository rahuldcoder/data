@entity0 -- a controversial program by the @entity3 that tried to track illegal weapons sales shows the need for tougher gun laws , according to a report issued thursday by a @entity9 @entity8			1
entitled " outgunned , " the report released by rep. @entity11 , @entity12 , quoted law enforcement officers on how lax or nonexistent laws and regulations on so - called " straw " purchases of illegal weapons , firearms trafficking and monitoring of the sales of assault rifles and other long guns contributed to the thriving trafficking of illegal weapons to @entity25			1
the report is an attempt by @entity11 and other @entity29 on the @entity30 to raise the issue of gun control in the investigation of " @entity34 , " the @entity3 program that focused on following people who legally bought weapons that were then transferred to criminals and destined for @entity25			1
instead of intercepting the weapons when they switched hands , @entity34 called for @entity3 agents to let the guns " walk " and wait for them to surface in @entity25 , according to the @entity43			1
the idea was that once the weapons in @entity25 were traced back to the straw purchasers , the entire arms smuggling network could be brought down			1
instead , the committee argued , letting the weapons slip into the wrong hands was a deadly miscalculation that resulted in preventable deaths , including that of @entity55 agent @entity34			0
the @entity29 report issued thursday said committee chairman rep. @entity57 of @entity59 prevented questions about the need for stronger gun control laws at a june 15 hearing on the @entity3 operation			1
" despite the chairman 's efforts to wall off any discussion of the nation 's gun laws , the record compiled during the committee 's investigation documents clearly that these same law enforcement agents believe that their efforts to combat international drug cartels would be enhanced significantly with common - sense improvements in several key areas , " the report said			2
it called for increased criminal penalties for illegal straw purchases , enactment by @entity83 of a " dedicated firearms trafficking statute , " and for @entity3 to get reports from gun dealers on purchases of multiple long guns " that are now the weapons of choice for @entity25 drug cartels			1
" @entity11 , the ranking @entity8 on the committee , told a forum on illegal firearms trafficking he organized thursday that he knew the recommendations of the new report " will face stiff resistance in @entity83 and beyond			0
" " before today 's forum even began , it was criticized as a conspiracy to confiscate the firearms of law - abiding citizens , which is ridiculous , " he said			0
@entity11 also said he and rep. @entity107 , @entity109 - @entity108 , would introduce legislation on the reforms called for in the report			0
in the report , federal agents called existing laws against straw purchasers insufficient and said the country needed a specific statute against weapons trafficking			2
" prosecutors and law enforcement agents should not have to bend over backwards to imprison those who provide military - grade weapons to murderers , " @entity11 said			0
the @entity3 operation has been criticized by president @entity125 , who promised " appropriate action " once a @entity127 investigation is complete			1
federal law enforcement sources say @entity130 , acting director of @entity3 , is expected to be forced out as a result			0
@entity34 was killed last year north of the @entity25 border in @entity133 after confronting bandits believed to be preying on illegal immigrants			2
two weapons found near the scene of the killing were traced to @entity34			0
@entity57 has called the operation " felony stupid			0
" as many as 2,000 semiautomatic rifles reached the hands of cartels as a result , and @entity57 said the top two @entity3 officials were briefed on the program regularly			2
in @entity25 , the case has drawn nationwide attention and sharp criticism from top officials , who have long stressed that @entity152 weapons are fueling the country 's drug war			2
@entity1 's @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0

*crackdown* on " straw " purchases , illegal gun sales needed
