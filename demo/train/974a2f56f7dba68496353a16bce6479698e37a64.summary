-- @entity1 of @entity2 and @entity3 of @entity4 have been awarded the @entity5 in economics for their work in market design and matching theory , the @entity11 announced monday			1
@entity1 and @entity3 's work focuses on finding the most efficient way to match parties in a transaction , whether it be students to schools or organ donors to recipients , according to the academy			1
@entity3 used game theory to study matching models , and @entity1 built on them to make real - world changes to existing markets , including school choice and organ transplants , the academy said			1
elements of their work are built into software that guides kidney donations in the @entity33 , as well as in school choice models in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and other @entity33 cities , @entity1 told reporters monday			1
@entity1 , who was awakened by an early morning call about their win , said he was not expecting the prize but was honored to share it with @entity3			2
" i 'm sure when i go to the class this morning my students will pay more attention , " he said			0
the economics prize is the sixth and final of the annual awards that spotlight the world 's top scholars and peacemakers			2
the economics award was not among the original prizes created in 1895 by @entity56 industrialist @entity55 to honor work in physics , medicine , chemistry , literature and peace			1
it was added as a category in 1969 by the @entity56 central bank in memory of the industrialist			1
as such , the economics prize is given by the @entity11 , following the same principles used to determine the other @entity5 winners , according to the @entity5 committee			1
the monetary award that accompanies the @entity5 was lowered by the foundation this year by 20 % from 10 million @entity56 kronor ( $ 1.5 million ) to 8 million kronor ( $ 1.2 million ) because of the turbulence that hit the financial markets			1
the economics selection follows last week 's awarding of the @entity78 to the @entity79 , a selection that surprised many and drew scorn from @entity84 and @entity85 demonstrators who took to the streets to protest austerity measures			0
opinion : @entity89 wasted an opportunity in its @entity78 the 27 - nation union was honored for its work in promoting democracy and reconciliation following @entity95 , even as it grapples with a financial crisis that threatens to break the @entity79 apart			0
opinion : why @entity98 deserved @entity78 " the @entity5 committee is a little late for an april fools joke , " said @entity99 , leader of the conservatives and @entity101 party in the @entity103			2
while @entity99 called the @entity5 committee " out of touch , " others applauded the selection			2
another surprise was the @entity89 's selection of @entity112 writer @entity111 as the winner of the @entity5 for literature			2
the @entity112 author , whose pen name means " not talking , " has captivated his countrymen by intertwining fantasy and gritty everyday life			0
@entity120 , a @entity122 member , is considered a writer within the system and has embraced official party restrictions on writing			0
he also was elected by the @entity122 to a vice chairman spot in the state - sanctioned @entity129			0
unlike the news blackout in @entity112 two years ago when @entity112 dissident @entity131 won the @entity78 , state - run media reported @entity120 's win immediately following the announcement			0
@entity135 of the @entity136 said the award by the @entity5 committee appeared to be a recognition of -- or attempt to please -- the @entity112 government			0
this year 's prize for economics was selected from among hundreds of nominations , the @entity5 committee said			1
two @entity33 shared the prize last year for their study of the cause - and - effect relationship between government and economic policy			1
@entity149 , a professor at @entity151 , and @entity152 , a professor at @entity153 , carried out their research independently , though their work was considered complementary			0
