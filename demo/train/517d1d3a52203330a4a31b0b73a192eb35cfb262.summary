-- @entity2 @entity1 faces disqualification from the @entity4 after stewards recommended his removal from the race because his hummer 's engine does not conform to regulations			1
the 43 - year - old appeared the main challenger to car leader @entity13 after winning both monday and tuesday 's stages , cutting the @entity17 driver 's advantage to almost six minutes			2
however , the ultimate decision over @entity1 's fate rests with the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , who must deliver their verdict within two months , although the loser could still appeal to motorsport 's global governing body , the @entity25 , should he be thrown out of the race			1
the stewards believe that @entity1 's modifying of the ventilation system , linked to his engine , improves its performance level -- a claim he denies			1
that appeal allowed @entity1 to continue racing in the 377 - kilometer 10th stage from @entity36 to @entity37 in @entity38 , although his hopes took a further knock as he subsequently lost 15 minutes to stage winner @entity41 of @entity42 after suffering damage to his car			0
" i hit a rock with both right - side tires and , as you can see , this wheel is way out , so we 've got some broken parts , " @entity1 told reporters			0
@entity53 's victory means he leapfrogs @entity54 into second place overall , a massive 19 minutes and five seconds behind fellow @entity56 driver @entity13			0
@entity1 is another 46 seconds adrift in third with just four stages remaining			1
former motorbike star @entity13 is bidding for a remarkable 10th overall win in the race and a fourth in the car section			0
meanwhile , just 16 seconds now separate @entity63 riders @entity61 and @entity64 in the motorcycle section after wednesday 's stage , which was won by @entity67			1
defending champion @entity64 finished second to his fellow spaniard on the day , while @entity17 's @entity69 came home fourth			2
" it 's the tone that 's been set for the rally and i think we 'll keep on battling until the end , " @entity53 told reporters			0
both riders have won the race three times , alternating victory between each other over the last six seasons .			0
