@entity0 -- @entity3 officials are considering what could happen to 15 alleged @entity6 pirates held on the @entity8 aircraft carrier following the killings of four @entity3 who were sailing around the world on a private yacht			1
@entity14 spokesman col. @entity13 referred questions on possible prosecution of the @entity6 to the @entity17 as well as to the @entity18 , which is heading the investigation off the coast of @entity6 focused on the 58 - foot - yacht quest that was seized by pirates last week			1
" they 'll be detained until the @entity17 makes a determination about possible prosecution , " @entity13 said			0
" the process is going on now to determine where they 'll be prosecuted			2
" @entity17 officials who will decide where and when the alleged pirates will be prosecuted were tight - lipped wednesday , but one senior law enforcement official acknowledged the transfer of the suspects to the @entity18 for a trial in the @entity3 will occur " soon			1
" two officials indicated the suspects would be tried in a @entity3 civilian court , but declined to say where			1
in previous cases involving @entity6 pirates and @entity3 vessels , the trials for suspects turned over from the @entity43 to the @entity18 were held in @entity44 , @entity45 , and @entity46			1
according to @entity3 officials , the four @entity3 -- ship owners @entity48 and @entity49 , along with @entity50 and @entity51 -- were found shot after @entity3 forces boarded the @entity54 early tuesday			1
@entity55 died from their wounds			0
the quest was being shadowed by four @entity3 warships after pirates seized it off the coast of @entity61 on friday			1
@entity3 forces responded after a rocket - propelled grenade was fired at a @entity43 ship about 600 yards away -- and missed -- and the sound of gunfire could be heard on @entity54 , according to @entity43 vice adm. @entity66			1
the killings signal escalating violence by @entity6 pirates who have increased torture and attacks on hostages in a bid to speed up the process of getting ransom money , said a spokesman for the @entity77 combating the piracy			2
what started several years ago as local piracy by @entity6 fishermen has been taken over by organized - crime elements that are well - armed and intent on cashing in on a lucrative operation , according to wing commander @entity85 of @entity86			1
" it was a real surprise to us that they had done this			0
normally , that 's their income , " @entity85 said , calling the pirates ' killing of hostages " literally shooting the hen that lays the golden eggs			1
" @entity99 , a former @entity3 ambassador to @entity100 now with the @entity101 think tank , said the @entity6 piracy was evolving " into a grotesque form of something like a big business			1
" international naval forces , including participation by the @entity3 and the @entity77 , have managed to reduce piracy in the @entity109 off @entity6 , a key shipping route , @entity99 noted			1
now the pirates are operating in open waters farther away , making international monitoring and protection more difficult , @entity99 said			2
" all of this would indicate that ending or controlling @entity6 piracy is no longer , if it ever was , purely a naval operation , " he said			0
@entity99 called for a broader approach , including international law enforcement and judicial procedures , anti-corruption forces and international development agencies to work on land as well as on the water			0
" you can not just simply snap your fingers and solve this , " @entity99 said			0
" it is not a case of sending an aircraft carrier to the horn of @entity133			0
it 's a real international conundrum			0
" earlier , @entity13 said it was too early to say if the killing of the four @entity3 would bring a change to @entity3 policy or tactics regarding the @entity6 pirates			1
@entity85 , however , noted the increasing use of violence by pirates against hostages indicated a change in their tactics			2
" these guys want money , they want it now , and they 're prepared to do whatever it takes to force the companies to pay up " right away , @entity85 said			0
" we 've seen a rise in violence toward hostages at a relatively kind of steady increase , " he said , noting the torture reports and now the killings			0
of reports of hostages being tortured on several vessels , @entity85 said : " it was n't kind of rough treatment ; it was pretty systematic torture			0
" @entity99 said shipping companies , their insurers , governments patrolling the waters off of @entity6 and others already are confronting the " huge " cost of piracy			0
now the increased threat to hostages raises the stakes even further , he said			0
" obviously it 's going to be a concern to any government that cares about its citizens , " @entity99 said , later adding : " the concern would be that if ransoms are n't paid , they 'll kill			0
" officials said there were 19 pirates in total in the seizing of the @entity54			1
two were found dead on board by @entity3 special forces members , who killed two more while clearing the vessel			1
thirteen others were captured and detained , along with two more who had earlier gone to a @entity43 ship to negotiate			0
the pirates were believed to have boarded the quest after traveling on a " mother ship			2
" the " mother ship " trend -- pirates using another hijacked merchant vessel -- has appeared in the past few months , said @entity199 , manager at the @entity200 in @entity201			2
according to @entity199 , the mother ships provide pirates with " a lot more reach , a lot more capability to move out ( farther ) into the @entity208			2
" in addition , he said , pirates can stay on board longer , have appropriate equipment and can demand the expertise of the ship 's crew			2
previously , pirates typically hijacked a vessel and held it until a ransom was paid , @entity199 said			2
so far in 2011 , " we have already seen more than 50 attacks carried out , " by @entity6 pirates , " @entity199 said			2
in april 2009 , pirates seized the @entity3 - flagged @entity224 , leading to a standoff in the @entity208			1
@entity3 forces moved to rescue @entity3 captain @entity228 after seeing a pirate aiming a weapon at his back , officials said at the time			1
three pirates were killed and one was arrested			0
the @entity6 man arrested was convicted of acts related to high - seas piracy , and a federal court in @entity46 sentenced him last week to more than 30 years in prison			0
as of february 15 , pirates were holding 33 vessels and 712 hostages , according to the @entity200			1
the @entity242 were from @entity243 , @entity244 , while @entity245 and @entity51 were from @entity246 , @entity0			0
the four had been traveling with yachts participating in the @entity249 since their departure from @entity251 , @entity252 , rally organizers said			0
the group , which organizes long - distance group cruises , said the @entity54 broke off on february 15 after leaving @entity255 , @entity256 , to take a different route			1
@entity1 's @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
