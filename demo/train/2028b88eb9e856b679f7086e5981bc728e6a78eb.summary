-- there was a time when my biggest fear was getting my brain munched by zombies			2
but that childhood fright of @entity9 past has given way to a scare that often grips me as a journalist today -- the fear of failure			2
alright , i know i 'm not alone here			0
many of you know exactly what i 'm talking about			0
it 's those moments of workplace indecision , avoidance , or perhaps procrastination all due to the simple fear of making a mistake on the job			0
so when i sat down with @entity27 chief @entity26 for @entity0 's " leading women , " i made sure to hit the topic			1
you see , just months into her job as ceo of the company , she had to manage through an episode of failure			1
make that , monstrous failure			0
in 2005 , one of the company 's signature files caused computers worldwide to crash			1
the effects were so far - reaching , the bug even forced ever - timely trains in @entity46 to grind to a halt			1
did that epic fail make @entity49 doubt herself or her ability to be the ceo ? not at all			1
instead , she focused on a solution			0
" there were two problems i tried to address , " she tells me			2
" one is external -- how do i help the system quickly recover ? my customers ' businesses need to continue			2
" the second one is internal : how do i make sure that the values of @entity27 -- innovation and ' dare to fail ' -- really stayed			1
" @entity49 says the lessons learned from that mistake helped propel @entity27 from a player in traditional antivirus software to the forefront of cloud computing protection			1
a company philosophy at @entity27 reads as follows : " we drive our growth by innovation ; we encourage risk - taking and our management style dares you to fail			1
" that call to embrace failure , like firewalking or " trust falls " at a corporate retreat , can reek of management malarkey			0
but @entity49 is a leader who sincerely takes it to heart			1
to this day , she still does n't know which employee was responsible for the faulty file that crashed computers across the planet			0
nor does she ever want to know			0
risk - taking and fear management came early in her career when @entity49 founded the company in 1988 with her brother - in - law , @entity96 , and sister , @entity97			1
cold - calling potential customers , she found herself reluctant and afraid to speak on the phone			0
to address her phobia , @entity49 mined her memories and rediscovered a moment in early childhood when her mother was speaking on the telephone just as lightning struck a tree that fell inside their home and set ablaze the phone 's wiring			1
" the impression just made me feel that the telephone line would kill my mom , " @entity49 tells me			1
" so something that you never expect -- that image from my childhood -- actually became an obstacle when i tried to do business			1
" @entity49 says once she identified that fear , it went away			2
" every time you overcome one obstacle , you feel you 've learned something and you grow			0
that 's the joy of entrepreneurship and taking challenges			0
" so what is the one obstacle that is holding all of us back ? did you ever turn down a challenging assignment because the depressive realist inside said you could n't do it ? ( i know i have			0
) how many times have you failed to truly speak your mind at a meeting ? ( guilty			0
) instead of sitting on our hands , we should raise them high and dare to ask that question , make that assertion , or take on that new challenge			0
like @entity26 , we must lean into our fear to conquer it .			2

@entity26 is ceo of @entity27 -- a @entity46 software security company
within months of becoming ceo , a bug caused worldwide problems for the business
@entity49 turned mishap into *opportunity* , turned company into cloud computing protection leader
