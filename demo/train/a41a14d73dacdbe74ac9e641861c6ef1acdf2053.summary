@entity2 maxi @entity0 eased to victory in the 65th annual @entity4 to @entity6 yacht race on monday			1
skippered by @entity0 , @entity0 crossed the finish of the 628 - mile race ahead of favorite @entity10 maxi @entity11 @entity0 had led since they left @entity12 on saturday and was not threatened during its two days , nine hours and two minutes at sea			1
@entity10 maxi @entity11 finished 16 nautical miles behind in second place with @entity19 yacht @entity17 a further 24 miles behind in third			1
@entity0 admitted he was taken aback by the large crowd which had gathered at the dockside to welcome his team home before he paid tribute to his crew			1
" we did n't expect to see anything like this crowd			0
we 're certainly honored , " he told the event 's official web site wwwrolexsydneyhobart.com			2
" i 'd like to thank the 21 guys in my crew			0
we did n't have any problems and i do n't think there was any time in the race when we were passed			0
" @entity0 continued : " there were occasions when we had to take a gamble and hope it paid off			1
we were very busy the whole race			0
there were occasions when there was a lot of breeze , and occasions when we drifted , so it made the race much more interesting			2
" i do n't think there was any part of the race that counted any more or less			0
we all had periods we were parked up			0
i think it was the advantage of making the least amount of mistakes of anybody that won us the race			2
