-- go ahead , read the headline again			2
it does say " writer 's black " and not " writer 's block			1
" no doubt , overlooking a mistake like that would be a gigantic copy editing if not editorial blunder			2
how often do we do the editorializing in our own minds before we even start to read a writer 's work ? a recent article by @entity18 writer toure ' about @entity20 quarterback @entity19 got me to thinking			1
opinion : why i wrote ' if @entity19 were white ' the article and provocative headline pose the question , " what if @entity19 were white ? " " hmmm , " i wondered out loud to another writer sitting next to me			1
" hmmm , " the writer said back to me , following up with a " that 's deep			1
" then we sat quietly for a few moments looking around the room , pondering			2
we did n't say much else , but the incident and the article stuck with me for a few days			1
@entity18 defends ' white ' @entity19 it stuck not because of the sports angle , but for the broader ramifications of his questions			1
it made me think about all the times i had to defend myself for something i said or wrote simply because of my gender , background and any other mechanism we use to define ourselves and other people			2
i thought about all the times i had been called privileged by @entity47 , biased by whites , narrow - minded by @entity49 , too sensitive by men and unfeeling by women , lefty by conservatives or right - wing by liberals			2
and i wondered what the response would have been if the reader knew nothing about my background or me			2
what would it be like ? so i decided to write this article anonymously and provide you the reader with a sort of written @entity67			1
i could be @entity68 or @entity69 or male or female			2
straight away , i must admit that i have a completely selfish reason for doing this			2
the filter of my own experiences had duped me , too			0
in all honesty , when i saw @entity79 's byline , my mind immediately leaped to the finish , drawing a conclusion that an @entity47 writer would probably go easy on @entity19			1
but i caught myself , stopped , and much like i do in both my personal and professional lives , i put the writer 's ethnicity aside and kept reading			1
so , in an effort to make it easier for you to do the same , i 'm removing my byline as i assess the racial and cultural differences that might have steered @entity19 onto the path of dog fighting , his demise and eventual redemption			1
in one of the neighborhoods of my youth , blacks and whites had vastly different relationships with animals ; mainly dogs			0
i 'm generalizing here , but whites typically treated their dogs as part of their families			0
the dogs lived indoors , and they climbed onto sofas and into beds at will			0
but many blacks did not want to eat at a home where dogs or cats had the run of the house			0
the logic went : an animal in the house meant animal hair in the food			0
and by the same token , ( again , a generalization ) whites were generally upset by their black friends who treated their animals as not human			0
dogs and cats were mostly kept outdoors unless the temperatures dipped below freezing or swelled to triple digits			0
both black people and white people kept any chickens outdoors , and the only violence the fowl faced was getting their necks wrung on the way to becoming sunday dinner			1
but for @entity49 i knew , cock fighting was not only accepted , but also expected			0
those who partook did n't understand why it 's ok to slaughter a rooster but it 's not ok to have them fight			0
@entity47 flock to the rodeo			0
and however you feel about any one of these probably has a lot to do with your relationship with animals growing up			0
just as the @entity18 article makes no excuses for @entity19 's behavior , this one does n't either			1
part of my mission is to help you understand that people from different backgrounds have different feelings about animals			0
and perhaps it has more to do with where you come from ( culture ) rather than the color of your skin			1
but in @entity168 , race somehow pervades the discussion on just about any subject			1
even @entity79 ' admits it in his own article when he questions the headline			1
he writes : " this question makes me cringe			0
it is so facile , naive , shortsighted and flawed that it is meaningless			0
whiteness comes with great advantages , but it 's not a get - out - of - every - crime - free card			0
killing dogs is a heinous crime that disgusts and frightens many @entity47			0
i 'm certain white privilege would not be enough to rescue a white @entity184 star caught killing dogs			1

@entity18 article about a " white " @entity19 got this author thinking
readers can make *assumptions* about authors ' race and culture
this anonymous writer *invites* you to guess those *attributes* from this essay
