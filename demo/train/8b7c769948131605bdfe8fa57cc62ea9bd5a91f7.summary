editor 's note : @entity2 has a business partnership with @entity4 , which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to @entity2			1
if you 've rolled up your sleeves and gotten experience , tell potential employers when applying for a job			1
talk to a dozen students on any college campus and you 're likely to hear a dozen different perspectives on what they hope to get out of college			0
some want high @entity20 ; some want to get into the work force and earn a lot of money			1
ask their parents and you 'll get just as many different answers			0
some parents hope that their children earn their degree and have an easy time finding a job			1
others want them to be at the top of the class so they can get into the best graduate school possible			0
and some just want their children to stop partying long enough to attend class once in a while			0
ask employers what they want from graduates and the answers are equally diverse			0
depending on the job , you might need a degree and an internship , a degree and work experience , or the right connections to even land an interview			1
according to the @entity53 , nearly 39 million @entity51 over the age of 18 have a bachelor 's degree			1
considering that 281 million people live in the country , college graduates are still a small percentage of the population			1
still , with a number in the millions , you are competing with a lot of job seekers who also have the same educational background as you			0
relying only on your bachelor 's to land a job is not the safest route to employment			1
as with most things , it 's all in the presentation			1
degree or not , presentation matters @entity74 studied biology as an undergraduate and biomedical research as a graduate student			1
during her job search , she found herself losing out on job opportunities because she lacked the proper experience , despite her education			2
" at the end of the 1980s , i spent more than one year looking for a job , " she remembers			0
" i kept getting this question : ' have you done anything in the area of molecular biology ? ' " she would tell employers that she did n't have the proper experience because she was n't specifically trained for that			2
" i did not mention the fact that i once assisted a graduate student who was putting dna and @entity96 into cultured cells			0
" what does that mean in layman 's terms ? because her specialization and the bulk of her experience was not in this particular field , she did n't consider the limited work with the graduate student worth mentioning			1
she later realized employers were n't looking for someone to be the ultimate authority on the subject ; they wanted someone who had a broad range of knowledge			0
" i realized my mistake more than two years after i got a job , " @entity74 remembers			0
" my first year i worked in an infectious disease lab. later , they put me in a molecular biology lab. when i helped with one of the projects in that lab , i realized that my old , unmentioned experience related to what i was doing at that time			2
" a degree is n't useless sure , if you 're applying for a job with bio- as a prefix , you know a degree is a requirement			2
but for less research - intensive jobs , you might think a degree can always be supplanted by enough experience			1
depending on your occupation , that could be true but is n't a hard and fast rule for all positions			0
for example , you might be able to find work at a museum , but you the odds of you transitioning into a curator can be extremely difficult without extensive education in art history and related courses			2
you could find that you hit a ceiling in an organization			0
although this bodes well for graduates who come armed with one or more degrees , it also means that workers in this industry have the opportunity to earn an education while they ascend the corporate ladder			0
in some cases , the combination of their experience and a recently awarded degree could be more impressive if you 've relied on your degree and have n't diversified your experience			1
how to present yourself here are some tips to keep in mind when presenting yourself to employers : even though you know education is n't the single factor in getting hired , it is often a prerequisite to land an interview			2
do n't hide your degree just because you have a lot of experience -- you do n't want to lose out on an interview because your education was overlooked			1
use all of your education to your advantage			0
connect the job requirements to any courses you took , whether as an elective or part of your minor			0
you might not have loved that statistics course , but if it 's relevant to the job , mention it			2
treat work experience and internships as proof that you 're a professional , not just a student			1
if you speak as if you see yourself as a student who does n't consider himself or herself as part of the working world , the employer might not either			2

presentation of your experience can be just as *important* as your degree
some 39 million @entity51 have a bachelor 's degree
present any of your internships or work experience that employer may appreciate
