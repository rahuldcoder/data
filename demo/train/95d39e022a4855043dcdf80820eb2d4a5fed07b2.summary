@entity0 -- president @entity2 heads to @entity3 , @entity4 , on tuesday to give a speech on the need for comprehensive immigration reform -- a perennial hot - button political issue that both @entity9 and @entity10 hope to use to their advantage in 2012			1
@entity2 has held a series of meetings with key @entity15 officials and reform advocates in recent weeks			1
despite an aggressive push for substantive policy changes from his political base , the president recently indicated he has ruled out acting on his own to implement provisions of a reform bill that failed to win congressional approval last year			1
nevertheless , immigration reform " remains a priority " for the administration , @entity25 press secretary @entity24 said monday			1
there has been bipartisan support for reform in the past , @entity24 noted , and " we think we can build support for it again in the future			0
" the issue requires " focus , " " education , " and " persistence , " @entity24 said			0
" the sooner it gets done , the better for the country			0
" @entity24 said the president 's speech is likely to highlight border security improvements and the economic costs stemming from a failure to change course			2
@entity10 leaders have indicated an unwillingness to consider broader changes -- including a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants -- until the @entity55 border is brought under tighter control			1
conservative frustration has boiled over in recent months in form of a rash of state - level proposals to apprehend and deport illegal immigrants			0
key parts of an @entity64 law requiring police officers to check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other statutes were recently blocked by the federal courts			0
the @entity70 sued @entity64 , arguing that only the federal government has the authority to dictate immigration policy			0
progressive reform advocates , meanwhile , have been frustrated by @entity76 's inability to pass the @entity77 , which would offer legal standing to immigrants who entered the @entity80 illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the country for at least five years			0
the bill would require , among other things , a high school or general education development diploma , two years of college or military service , and criminal background checks			0
advocates say the bill would give legal standing to young people brought to the @entity80 by their parents who have bettered themselves and served their new country			0
@entity10 opponents equate the measure to amnesty , and have said it would signal to the world that the @entity80 is not serious about enforcing its laws or its borders			2
they have also called the bill unfair to immigrants who , in many cases , waited years to come to the country legally			0
the measure was defeated by a @entity10 filibuster in the @entity109 last december after winning passage in the @entity111			2
most analysts believe it has little chance of clearing the @entity10 - controlled @entity25 now			1
regardless , the immigration issue remains politically potent			1
@entity2 won several @entity117 states in 2008 -- including @entity118 , @entity119 , and @entity120 -- partly on the rising power of the @entity15 vote			2
@entity9 believe @entity124 voters might put traditionally @entity10 @entity64 in play next year			2
in the long run , @entity9 are also hoping to use their advantage among @entity15 to make inroads in core @entity10 states such as @entity4			2
@entity2 won over two - thirds of the nationwide @entity124 vote in 2008			1
his approval rating among @entity15 hovered around 68 percent during the first three months of this year , according to the most recent @entity134 polls			0
for their part , @entity10 have depended on the immigration issue in the past to fire up conservative voters			1
some analysts also believe that if @entity9 push too hard , too fast on immigration , particularly in tough economic times , it could push swing voters toward the @entity10 .			1

president @entity2 will *discuss* the need for immigration reform tuesday in @entity3
@entity10 leaders have opposed reform without tighter border controls
immigration reform is believed to have little chance of clearing the @entity10 - controlled @entity25
