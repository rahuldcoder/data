@entity2 peace talks aimed at ending the bloody crisis in eastern @entity4 concluded thursday in a breakthrough : a ceasefire that 's due to start sunday and an agreement for both sides to pull back heavy weapons			1
if the ceasefire holds -- which is far from certain -- it could end a 10 - month conflict that has claimed more than 5,000 lives , many of them civilians , and plunged @entity17 relations to their lowest point since the end of the @entity20			1
" we had just two options : bad , and worse			1
so we decided at this particular period of time to get the bad option			2
probably this option will save the lives of @entity4 soldiers , and i hope this option will save lives of @entity4 civilians , of innocent people , who are under a constant shelling of @entity35 - led terrorists , " @entity4 prime minister @entity26 said			1
" it 's better to have this new deal rather than not to have ( it )			2
but we do not trust any words or any papers			0
we are to trust only actions and deeds , " he said			0
the @entity43 issued a statement with a tone of guarded optimism			0
" the @entity47 welcomes the agreement reached today in @entity49			2
" the agreement represents a potentially significant step toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict and the restoration of @entity4 's sovereignty			1
" the statement urged that all parties take " immediate , concrete steps " to fulfill their commitments			0
" heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the conflict zone , and @entity35 must end its support for the separatists and withdraw its soldiers and military equipment from eastern @entity4 , " the statement said			1
addressing reporters after the four - way overnight talks in @entity49 , @entity70 , @entity35 president @entity67 said all parties had agreed to the ceasefire starting february 15 and called for restraint in the interim			1
" i call on both sides to end the bloodshed as soon as possible " and come to a real political solution to the conflict , he said			0
@entity67 said both sides have agreed to pull back heavy weapons			1
the talks between @entity35 , @entity4 , @entity81 and @entity82 took so long , he said , because authorities in @entity84 still refuse to have direct contact with separatists			1
@entity82 chancellor @entity88 , speaking alongside @entity81 president @entity87 , said more work remained to be done , but " what we have on the table gives us great hope			1
" the agreement may not be perfect , she said , but it has provided a chance to improve matters in eastern @entity4 and is " clearly preferable to the situation if we had done nothing			1
" @entity88 said @entity67 would be talking to separatist leaders about the deal			0
they were expected to travel to @entity103 on thursday to meet with @entity35 lawmakers			0
meanwhile , @entity4 president @entity105 headed to @entity106 , @entity107 , to brief @entity109 leaders on the situation			1
both @entity87 and @entity88 paid tribute to his efforts on behalf of @entity4 in the talks			1
@entity115 president @entity114 said the agreement was " welcome news and gives hope " but that hope was not enough			0
" the real test is the respect of the ceasefire on the ground , " he said			0
he added that after speaking with @entity88 , his feeling was " that we should remain extremely cautious			0
" said one young man in @entity84 , who recently signed up to fight @entity128 rebels : " i do n't believe in the agreement at all			0
we 've signed agreements in the past and all of them were breached			0
" in a televised statement , two separatist leaders , @entity135 , of the self - proclaimed @entity136 , and @entity137 , of the self - proclaimed @entity138 , indicated they supported the deal			1
" we must give @entity4 this chance , " said @entity135 , adding that the peace plan envisages constitutional reforms that will protect the rights of people in eastern @entity4 and change @entity84 's approach			1
@entity137 said any violations of the terms agreed to so far , with further talks still needed on some points , would mean no more deals			0
" all responsibility for any violation of the agreement is on @entity105 , " he said			0
a previous ceasefire deal , agreed to on september 19 , also in @entity49 , broke down amid continued fighting			2
it called for a drawback of heavy weapons , greater autonomy in the eastern @entity162 and @entity163 regions and a buffer zone along the @entity35 - @entity4 border			1
the @entity166 released details of the new agreement , which is similar in part to the september deal , on its website , but it 's still unclear how elements of it will work			0
the points include : an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in parts of @entity163 and @entity162 starting at midnight on february 15			0
the withdrawal of all heavy weapons by both parties at equal distances in order to create a security zone width of at least 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) from each other for artillery systems and more for longer - range weapons			1
the ceasefire line for the @entity4 is the current front line and for the separatists it 's the front line as it was at the time of the previous deal on september 19			1
this process should begin no later than the next day after the ceasefire and should be over within 14 days			2
the @entity192 , which has a monitoring team in @entity4 , will monitor the ceasefire line and withdrawal of heavy weapons			1
a dialogue on new local elections and the special status of the @entity163 and @entity162 regions will begin the day after the withdrawal			2
a law will be created to give amnesty to people involved in events in @entity162 and @entity163			0
both sides must ensure the release and exchange of all hostages and illegally held prisoners by no later than the fifth day after the withdrawal			0
@entity213 payments such as pensions should be restored , and @entity4 authorities should regain full control of the banking system in conflict - affected areas			1
full control of the border will be restored to the @entity4 government , beginning the day after local elections are held			1
withdrawal of all foreign troops and military equipment from @entity4 , including mercenaries , and the disarmament of militia groups			1
@entity82 foreign minister @entity229 voiced cautious optimism after thursday 's deal , which came after 17 hours of talks			1
" we have not achieved everything , but at least there is a ceasefire			0
this also includes agreements on securing the eastern borders of @entity4 , elections and the exchange of prisoners , " he said in a statement			1
" it is a chance to move away from escalation and towards political momentum			0
" in a joint declaration , released by the @entity82 government , the four leaders stated " their full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of @entity4 " and that they " firmly believe that there is no alternative to an exclusively peaceful settlement			1
" the leaders " will use their influence on relevant parties " to ensure the package of measures are put in place , the declaration said			0
" leaders share the conviction that improved cooperation between the @entity269 , @entity4 and @entity35 will be conducive to the crisis settlement , " it added			2
to that end , the three parties will hold further talks on energy supply and a possible free trade deal between @entity4 and the @entity269 , which is of concern to @entity35 , it said			1
the question of @entity4 's territorial integrity and sovereignty was a key issue going into the talks			1
@entity35 annexed its southeastern @entity284 region last spring , shortly before separatists in the @entity163 and @entity162 regions declared their independence from @entity84 , triggering months of conflict			0
" @entity4 will always be a unitary state			2
no federalization whatsoever ! # @entity292 , " @entity105 tweeted after the deal was announced			0
in a post on his @entity295 page , he said that " we did not agree to a single ultimatum " and that the ceasefire would be implemented regardless of any previous agreements			0
" for the successful reform we need just one precondition : peace			0
and we tried to do our best to make @entity4 a successful state , peaceful , reliable with a very strong @entity109 aspiration , " the @entity4 president later told reporters in @entity106			2
the @entity82 - and @entity81 - led peace initiative was prompted by worsening fighting between separatists and @entity4 government forces in recent weeks , threatening not only the lives of more civilians , but the stability of the region			1
@entity0 's @entity315 in the @entity163 region said separatist fighters that his team spoke to had learned of the ceasefire deal from @entity0 -- and were highly skeptical of any promises made			1
the noise of shelling could still be heard thursday , and there was no obvious change in the tempo of the combat , he said			0
a separatist fighter who spoke to @entity0 in @entity328 , not far from @entity163 city , said : " @entity4 wo n't have a ceasefire			1
@entity4 armed forces , i mean			2
we can resolve this conflict only one way : @entity4 withdraws its armed forces from the territory of the @entity337			2
that 's the only possible way			0
" " how can we talk to them ? " asked another fighter			0
" only with this , " he said , slapping his weapon			0
it 's possible the separatists may seek to seize further territory before sunday			0
since the @entity4 forces have to withdraw their weapons from the current front line as the ceasefire comes into effect , the separatists stand to keep hold of significant territory they 've won in recent weeks			1
a spokesman for the @entity356 and @entity355 of @entity4 told @entity0 on thursday that two @entity4 soldiers had been killed and 21 injured in the past 24 hours			1
@entity35 tanks , rocket launchers and armored personnel carriers had also crossed the border from @entity35 into @entity4 overnight , he said			2
@entity35 has steadfastly denied accusations that it is sending forces and weapons into @entity4			1
but top @entity366 and @entity4 leaders have said there is n't any doubt that @entity35 is behind surging violence and separatists ' efforts to take over territory in eastern @entity4			2
meanwhile , @entity374 director @entity373 on thursday announced a new @entity374 bailout package that 's worth $ 17.5 billion over the next four years			0
it has still to be approved by the board of directors			0
" over the past year , despite the challenging environment , the @entity4 authorities have clearly shown their commitment to ambitious reform on several key fronts , " @entity373 said			2
these include strong fiscal discipline and moves to strengthen anti-corruption measures			0
the deal replaces a separate $ 17 billion bailout agreed to last year by the @entity374			2
only $ 4.5 billion of those funds were distributed , bringing the @entity374 's total commitment to $ 22 billion			0
the crisis in @entity4 , which stemmed from a trade agreement , has forced more than 1.5 million people from their homes , according to the @entity395			2
@entity0 's @entity396 , @entity397 , @entity398 , @entity399 , @entity400 , @entity401 and @entity402 contributed to this report .			2

" we had just two options : bad , and worse , " the @entity4 pm tells @entity0
a @entity82 government spokesman says the deal , reached after 17 - hour talks , is a " reason for hope "
the deal includes a ceasefire to begin sunday and the withdrawal of heavy weapons
