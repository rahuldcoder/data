@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities announced murder charges thursday against the wife of disgraced @entity8 figure @entity6 , a new step in a scandal @entity3 's ruling hierarchy is scrambling to put behind them			1
@entity6 's wife , @entity14 , is accused of killing @entity16 businessman @entity15 in november , the state news agency @entity13 reported			1
@entity14 and a family aide have been accused of poisoning @entity15 , who died in november			1
@entity15 died in the southwestern @entity3 metropolis of @entity19 , where @entity6 was the @entity8 chief and a rising star in the party -- the son of one of the " eight immortals " of the revolution that created modern @entity3			1
the case has forced the @entity8 leadership to confront allegations of wrongdoing by a high - ranking member in an unusually public way , said @entity31 , a top @entity3 analyst at the @entity32 in @entity33			1
" the disruption of his departure from office and his wife 's crimes have made it difficult to present a facade of unity to their people , " @entity31 said			2
@entity3 's internet ' battlefield ' over @entity6 that united front has been key to ruling @entity3 for 2,000 years , he said			1
the current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining it since 1989 , when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with the pro-democracy demonstrations in @entity0 's @entity54			1
instead , the scandal surrounding @entity6 and his family " showed what people suspected was high - level corruption at high levels of government , " @entity31 said			1
now , the leadership is trying to resolve the affair before its once - in - a - decade leadership transition at the @entity66 meeting later this year , said @entity67 , an international relations professor at @entity68 and a longtime @entity3 watcher			2
" there was a desire on the part of the @entity8 to get this case settled			0
it 's not yet , but it is out of the party and into the hands of criminal courts -- well before the @entity78 , " @entity67 said			2
with the issue now before the courts , the case could be resolved " within the next couple weeks , " he said			0
" with these cases being dealt with at this time , i expect there to be smooth sailing to the @entity78 , " he said			0
" there may be some bargaining to go , but most of it has been done			0
" @entity15 , 41 , was found dead in his hotel room in @entity19 , a city of more than 30 million			0
officials quickly blamed his death on " excessive consumption of alcohol , " according to media reports , and his body was cremated without an autopsy			0
but the matter blew open in february , when @entity6 's longtime lieutenant , @entity98 , sought refuge at the @entity101 @entity100 in nearby @entity102			1
@entity98 , the former police chief who managed @entity6 's anti-crime push , wanted political asylum , apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information against his boss			1
media reports and online posts claimed @entity98 clashed with @entity6 after suggesting @entity15 had been poisoned amid a business dispute with @entity6 's wife -- an allegation that appears in the charges announced thursday			1
daring to speak out about @entity6 thriller @entity14 and family aide @entity115 were arrested in early april			1
the same day , @entity13 announced that @entity6 had been stripped of his seats on the @entity8 's @entity117 and @entity118 , the nation 's ruling organs , for an unspecified " serious breach of regulations			2
" who is @entity14 ? but @entity31 said @entity98 , not @entity6 , " is probably the most hated " figure in the affair for going to the @entity101			1
@entity98 was taken into custody once he left the consulate for entering the diplomatic post without authorization			0
@entity31 said his gambit forced @entity3 to deal with the scandal with an unprecedented level of transparency , prodded along by social media			1
" that 's keeping them honest in a lot of places where they could be dishonest in the past , " he said			0
meanwhile , the party has painted @entity6 as an outlier who violated party discipline and has been " very careful " not to use his case to purge the party of most of his supporters			2
@entity14 and @entity115 are awaiting trial in @entity148 , in eastern @entity3			2
a @entity6 family friend told @entity1 that @entity14 's lawyers were chosen by the government , not the family			1
the friend , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter , also said the @entity6 family was not notified of @entity14 's whereabouts until last week			1

@entity67 said that allegation is the " one real surprise " in the charges			0
" this had not previously been reported , " he said			0
@entity16 , which had asked @entity3 to investigate the matter further after being informed of growing concern about @entity15 's case , said it welcomed the charges			1
" the details of the ongoing investigation are a matter for the @entity3 authorities , " a @entity175 spokesman said in a statement thursday			2
" however , we are glad to see that the @entity3 authorities are continuing with the investigation into the death of @entity15			2
we are dedicated to seeking justice for him and his family and we will be following developments closely			0

among the companies @entity15 advised was @entity196 , a consulting firm founded by former officers of the @entity16 spy agency @entity199			0
that link fueled rumors that @entity15 might have had connections to @entity16 intelligence services			0
but in a rare public statement on such matters in april , @entity16 foreign secretary @entity204 denied that possibility			0
" mr. @entity15 was not an employee of the @entity16 government in any capacity , " he said in a letter			0
he said the @entity16 government would usually neither confirm nor deny those accounts , but that he was making an exception " given the intense interest in this case			0
" @entity1 's @entity217 contributed to this report .			0
