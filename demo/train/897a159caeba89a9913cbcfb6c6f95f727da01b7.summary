-- who would n't expect great things from the world 's second largest land mass ? this is a nation hoarding enough prosperity , natural beauty and curling talent to serve a population a hundred times its size			1
but @entity11 is more than elbow room , good roads , respected banks , promo posters of @entity16 on horseback , sweet views of @entity18 and tired media frenzies about the odd crack - smoking mayor			1
this country could really brag about all the stuff that truly sets it apart			0
not that it ever would			0
self - effacing modesty is one the more endearing @entity11 virtues -- along with these 10 national assets that really put the " o " in @entity11			1
apologizing it 's not so easy to get a simple apology in most of the world			2
getting your foot stepped on in @entity35			0
not having the door held open for you in @entity37			0
that 's just all part of unrepentant life			2
in @entity11 , apologies happen constantly -- " sorries " flying in from all sides like swarms of affable killer bees			1
apologies are issued not just for some negligible mishap , but for actually having the gall to be on the receiving end of one			0
a @entity52 poll titled " sorry ... i 'm @entity11 , " found that 90 % of @entity11 aged 18 - 25 will immediately apologize if a stranger bumps into them			1
but while it may be true that some of the ugliest brawls in @entity11 have been waged over who 's sorrier , travelers should be wary of such niceties , notes another @entity11 apologist : " sometimes we 're actually expressing our sympathy for your shortcomings			1
lakes and " @entity66 " @entity11 has more lakes than any other country -- about 3 million			1
the province of @entity70 alone contains about a third of the world 's freshwater , spread over 250,000 lakes			2
no surprise that " heading up to the lake " is more than just a favorite national phrase			0
it 's @entity11 's sacred version of lighting out for the territory -- but with cottages furnished with @entity82 chairs , @entity84 canoes and competing @entity85 and loon mating call soundtracks			1
recently , @entity70 's prime lake district , @entity82 , got the nod from @entity89 as the top summer destination -- in the world			2
well , yeah , eh ? it 's beauty up there			2
stand - in movie locations even if you 've never set foot in @entity97 , @entity98 or those handful of cities in between , you 've frequently been staring right at them without knowing it			1
why ? because @entity103 loves making movies in @entity11 -- big movies -- while passing the settings off as @entity106 , @entity107 , ancient @entity108 , the bow of history 's most ill - fated oceanliner ... basically anywhere else but @entity11			1
if you 've sat through " @entity113 , " you 've visited @entity115 's @entity114 -- at least via celluloid			1
" @entity117 " ? that ai n't the @entity119 , pardner			0
it 's @entity122 's @entity121 country			2
" capote " ? you 're not in @entity124 , @entity125			0
" twilight " ? @entity97			0
" @entity127 " ? @entity128			0
" titanic " ? much of it filmed off the coast of @entity98			0
and where in the world was @entity135 's shack in " @entity136 " ? just up the road from @entity138 in the @entity139 -- a moonscape - ish backcountry that 's also passed for @entity140 , @entity108 , @entity141 and @entity142 in several film and tv productions			1
air in a recent national air quality study by the @entity147 , @entity11 placed third for the cleanest air on the planet			1
until the first and second placers ( @entity153 and @entity154 ) are covered in @entity0 's " better than anywhere else " series , we direct your breath to @entity11 cities -- which average a relatively pristine 13 micrograms of @entity161 particles per cubic meter			1
humor @entity11 are hilarious -- sometimes even intentionally -- as a disproportionate number of comic heavyweights like @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and so many others have repeatedly confirmed over the years			1
what makes @entity11 so crazy funny ? the subject has launched sociological studies , none of which are funny at all			1
but even if you 've never watched @entity183 , ca n't name a single member of " @entity185 " and were n't aware that @entity186 was created and produced by a @entity115 , or that @entity128 's @entity187 is the world 's biggest comedy festival , or that the most deadly funny movie sequence ever filmed ( the " @entity191 ! " scene from 1979 's " @entity193 " ) was directed by a dude from @entity195 -- know this : if there 's one thing @entity11 barrels superbly at home or abroad , for whatever boring reason , it 's laughs			1
chocolate bars just a few giant corporations pump out most of the world 's mass market candy bars -- but not always with the same goods under that familiar - looking wrapper			1
" @entity11 chocolate is higher in fat and it is a higher particle size , " a @entity209 's senior chocolate expert recently noted in the @entity210 , adding that @entity209 's now offers a separate recipe for the more discriminating @entity11 chocolate palate			1
" @entity215 tend to gravitate toward a little more of a grittier or even cheesier flavor			0
" that 's why eating any of those generic chocolate bars or local @entity11 faves like @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , heck even @entity223 in @entity224 , is a creamy , velvety experience			1
and why a @entity225 somewhere else is a gritty , cheesy , polyglycerol polyricinoleate - y one			2
ski country sitting across the border from @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity107 and @entity231 would be intimidating to most countries hawking their own powdery slopes			0
not @entity11 , which boasts some of the best reasons to haul your skis or snowboard a little farther north			2
in the @entity119 , there 's @entity240 , plunked right in gorgeous @entity241 , and a ring of powder havens throughout eastern @entity244			2
@entity245 is one of the world 's leading ski resorts , getting a " best in @entity251 " nod from @entity250 last year			2
in the @entity142 , there 's @entity255 's beer - commercial - fun @entity253 -- where apr√®s - ski needs no translation			2
heli - skiing ? that all started in the @entity11 @entity260 , which remains one of the best places to do it			1
nation branding no national symbol is as ubiquitous as @entity11 's maple leaf			1
from @entity267 to @entity268 , it 's everywhere you look -- a proud , unrelenting reminder of where you are			0
the most obsessive leaf activity occurs abroad , where generations of flag - bearing @entity11 backpackers are famous for sewing maple leaf patches onto their bags just to make sure everyone 's clear at a glance who they are			1
see the leaf ? @entity11			2
" no other country on earth seems to feel the same need to self - identify , " posts one traveler from an undisclosed country			0
highway grub road trips are all about the food			0
at least in places like @entity122 or @entity297 , where nothing works up an appetite like hours of sedentary driving along some of the longest , straightest roads known to non-australian mankind with nothing to do but count @entity306 stations -- and pull over for the best comfort food gracing any rest stop			0
@entity311 ... if you do n't know these names , it 's time to look beyond the @entity315			2
you can eat @entity317 wherever			0
nothing says gustatory bliss on the @entity320 like a peameal & natural smoked @entity323 burger , or half - chicken plate with @entity311 , or a box of @entity326 with a double - double coffee			0
better grab a butter tart and @entity330 bar , too			0
it 's a long way from @entity332 to @entity333			0
adorable terms and phrases while you 'll be hard - pressed to find a real - life , toque - wearin ' local who 's ever called someone a " hoser " or told them to " take off , " @entity11 do call their two - dollar coins " toonies , " cases of beer " two - fours " and napkins " serviettes " in polite company			1
nowhere else will you be called a " rink rat " for loitering at ice arenas			0
or be " given the gears " if you do something dumb			0
or get asked , " what do you pay for hydro ? " or alerted that " your gitch is showing " if your belt is too loose			0
@entity358 is a @entity115 native living without apologies ( most of the time ) in @entity361 .			0

@entity363 titled " sorry ... i 'm @entity11 , " finds 90 % of @entity11 aged 18 - 25 apologize if a stranger bumps them
even if you 've never visited @entity11 , chances are you 've been staring at it in @entity103 movies
