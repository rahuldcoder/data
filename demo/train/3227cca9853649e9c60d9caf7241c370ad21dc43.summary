-- @entity2 associate professor @entity1 was in the running this week for " @entity3 on the @entity4 " -- and all because of $ 4			1
after accusing a restaurant of overcharging him , @entity1 began an epic back and forth with the management that went viral			1
now , the professor is apologizing for letting the dispute spiral so out of control			2
according to @entity13 , the saga began last week when @entity1 placed an order at a family - operated @entity18 - area @entity16 restaurant named @entity20			1
he was hungry for sauteed prawns with roasted chili and peanut , stir - fried chicken with spicy capsicum , braised fish filets and napa cabbage with roasted chili , and shredded chicken with spicy garlic sauce			0
when he placed his order , @entity1 thought his meal would run him $ 53.35			1
but when he checked his receipt , he noticed he 'd been charged an additional $ 4 -- or , as he noted in the first of several emails he sent to @entity20 , an apparent " increase of $ 1 on each and every item			1
" celebrated bartender @entity38 , who manages the bar inside his parents ' @entity20 location , was the one to respond to @entity1 's complaint			2
in doing so , he kicked off an epic three - day email exchange that ended with @entity1 , who is also a lawyer and fashions himself as a " web sheriff , " considering legal action against the restaurant			1
it turns out that the menu @entity1 viewed on @entity20 's website was out of date , which @entity38 apologized for and said he would fix			1
this was @entity1 's response : " under @entity57 law , it turns out to be a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price			2
i urge you to cease this practice immediately , " he wrote			0
" in the interim , i suggest that @entity20 refund me three times the amount of the overcharge			0
the tripling reflects the approach provided under the @entity57 consumer protection statute , @entity70 , wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations			0
" whether @entity1 offered a correct interpretation of the law in that instance has been up for debate			2
but @entity1 's email exchange with @entity38 did n't end there			1
after @entity38 offered to pay @entity1 $ 3 as restitution , the professor replied that giving only him a refund would be " an exceptionally light sanction for the violation that has occurred			1
" as a result , @entity1 told @entity38 that he 'd reported the issue to local authorities and hoped that would cause the restaurant to " identify all consumers affected and to provide refunds to all of them			2
" after more back - and - forth , @entity38 eventually had to ask : " is this really worth your time ? " for @entity1 , the answer was " yes			2
" he told @entity95 in a statement that " the restaurant at issue knew the website prices had been ' out of date for quite some time			0
' at what point should they do something about it ? i 'm pleased to have at least gotten the problem fixed for the benefit of others			0
" the professor seemed to have a change of heart on wednesday , posting an apology to his website			0
" having reflected on my interaction with @entity38 , including what i said and how i said it , it 's clear that i was very much out of line , " @entity1 wrote			2
" i aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others , no matter what the situation			0
clearly i failed to do so			0
i am sorry , and i intend to do better in the future			0
i have reached out to @entity38 and will apologize to him personally as well			0
" on @entity124 , @entity1 had been raked over the coals , with some accusing him of living up to the worst stereotypes about lawyers and @entity2 minds			1
his interaction has even put some students at @entity2 on the defense			0
there 's now a fundraising campaign to give to those in need with the hope that it 'll help counteract the " negative stereotypes of @entity2 and @entity2 ( that ) were reinforced " with @entity1 's dispute			1
the online campaign is asking " all @entity2 students to flip the script by donating $ 4 to provide food for those in need			1
" and for @entity20 , this feud has turned into some good publicity			0
the restaurant 's @entity148 page has received a steady stream of positive comments over the past few days , even from folks who have yet to taste the food			0
" i live in @entity165 , so i have n't eaten here , " said one @entity148 user named @entity155 " but read the boston.com story about the @entity158 prof / troll slamming them over a $ 4 dispute , and just wanted to show my support and respect for how the owners handled themselves and the troll			1

new : @entity1 apologized wednesday for his part in the dispute
the @entity2 professor *claimed* he was overcharged $ 4
his email fight with a family - operated restaurant has caught the @entity4 's attention
