@entity0 -- as the scandal over the discovery of horse meat in products labeled as pure beef widened , the @entity3 's health chief vowed wednesday to put in place a plan to restore consumer confidence			1
" the issue before us today is therefore overwhelmingly one of fraudulent labeling rather than one of safety , " @entity12 said in a statement after an emergency meeting in @entity15 with authorities from @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
he noted that @entity3 legislation allows horse meat to be used for the production of minced meat and meat preparations , " however , it has to be declared on the label			1
" it is the responsibility of @entity3 member states to check on whether a product presents a risk and complies with the law , @entity12 said			1
in the case of horse meat , the commission has checked on whether member states have complied with requirements about hygiene and residues of veterinary drugs , he said			1
" analyses are under way to identify the possible presence of residues of veterinary drugs , especially where unlabeled horse meat has been found , " he said			1
a meeting of the @entity52 of the @entity53 and @entity54 is scheduled for friday , he said			0
" this meeting will provide a forum to ascertain the precise state - of - play of the ongoing investigations in the member states , and enable discussions on a possible coordinated response , " he said			0
the commission will recommend to the standing committee a plan that will include widespread testing " to restore the confidence of all @entity68 consumers , " he said			2
the plan " should be communicated by member states by 15 april , " he said			0
the plan will recommend that member states ensure that " any misleading labeling practices " be identified , and will ask , " as a preventive measure , " that member states ensure that any residues of the veterinary drug phenylbutazone be identified in establishments handling raw horse meat " so as to unearth any related safety concern			1
" the member states should then report their findings back to the commission , he said			0
the talks in @entity82 came a day after @entity21 police and health officials raided a slaughterhouse and meat company as part of the investigation into how horse meat ended up in products identified as beef			1
the slaughterhouse , in @entity93 , @entity94 , is believed to have supplied horse carcasses to @entity96 , a @entity97 firm that then sold the meat as beef for kebabs and burgers			1
authorities have suspended operations at both facilities and seized all remaining meat and company files , which include a client list			2
neither company was immediately available for comment			0
" i ordered an audit of all horse - producing abattoirs in the @entity21 after this issue first arose last month and i was shocked to uncover what appears to be a blatant misleading of consumers , " @entity110 , @entity111 director of operations , said tuesday			1
environment secretary @entity118 called the revelations " absolutely shocking			0
" " it 's totally unacceptable if any business in the @entity21 is defrauding the public by passing off horse meat as beef , " he said			1
" i expect the full force of the law to be brought down on anyone involved in this kind of activity			0
" in a written statement to parliament , @entity118 said wednesday that both the raided businesses had a legitimate trade in horse meat , " but investigations so far indicate that horse meat has been used in @entity21 produce as though it is beef			1
" horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100 % beef sold in @entity141 , the @entity21 and @entity17			1
they included lasagna sold by frozen food giant @entity144 and spaghetti bolognese sold by @entity21 supermarket giant @entity146 , both made by @entity17 supplier @entity148			2
the industry was already reeling from a bombshell last month , when @entity153 investigators found horse and pig dna in a number of hamburger products			2
investigations are under way in @entity17 , @entity141 and @entity21			2
in @entity18 , prime minister @entity160 said monday that the two slaughterhouses in the country that were initially suspected to have links to the horse meat scandal never had direct contact with @entity148 and have done nothing illegal			2
" this tendency to throw the responsibility as far away as possible , eventually to the new members ( of the @entity3 ) , to countries that might have a weaker pr policy , is something that bothers me , " he said			2
minister of agriculture @entity173 said there was no evidence of mislabeling in @entity18			0
@entity148 has not responded to @entity1 's requests for comment			0
but ceo @entity179 told @entity17 news agency @entity180 on sunday that a @entity17 supplier " fooled " his company			0
" we were victims , " he told @entity180			0
this month , @entity21 's @entity184 called for more specific labeling of meat products and asked that labels bear the words " @entity21 origin			1
" @entity21 food companies have been told to test their beef products for " authenticity " and report back to authorities by friday			1
@entity21 supermarket chain @entity194 said wednesday that it had " in recent weeks " removed from its shelves frozen meatballs labeled as beef after tests indicated that two batches may have contained pork			2
but tests revealed no horse meat in its meatballs or frozen beef burgers , it said			1
in the @entity208 , @entity207 effectively prohibited the slaughtering of horses for human consumption in 2007 , by denying the use of federal funds to inspect horses destined to become food , a 2011 @entity206 report said			0
the legal maneuver does not preclude horse owners from selling to slaughterhouses in @entity219 and @entity220 , and the @entity206 said in a report that many @entity208 have taken advantage of that opportunity			0
" from 2006 through 2010 , @entity208 horse exports for slaughter increased by 148 and 660 % to @entity219 and @entity220 , respectively , " the report said			0
" as a result , nearly the same number of @entity208 horses was transported to @entity219 and @entity220 for slaughter in 2010 -- nearly 138,000 -- as was slaughtered before domestic slaughter ceased			0
" @entity1 's @entity231 in @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 in @entity0 and journalist @entity235 in @entity236 , @entity18 , contributed to this report .			0
