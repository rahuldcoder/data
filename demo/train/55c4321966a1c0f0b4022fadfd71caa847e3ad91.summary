-- president @entity1 will no doubt attempt to use thursday 's meeting with pope @entity3 as a platform to promote his political agenda at home , especially as it relates to poverty and income inequality			1
it 's no secret that @entity3 has made these issues central components of the first year of his papacy -- nor that the president has already tried to exploit this			1
not long after the pontiff released his 47,000 - word apostolic exhortation , @entity18 , @entity1 lifted language directly from the document in a partisan speech of his own			1
but the attempt to tether himself to @entity3 is an awkward and ultimately doomed one			1
5 things you did n't know about @entity26 and presidents for one , the president is currently facing the largest religious liberty class action lawsuit in @entity31 history			1
of the 300 and counting plaintiffs suing the @entity1 administration on religious freedom grounds , perhaps most famous are the @entity35 , an order of nuns founded to care for the impoverished and dying elderly			1
another well - known plaintiff is @entity40 , the university where the president loudly promised to keep conscience rights intact with the health care overhaul			2
it was the religious liberty version of the " if you like your plan , you can keep it " speech			2
in 2011 , the president stripped the @entity49 of @entity50 of its longstanding funding for human - trafficking work because of the @entity54 ' conscientious objections to referring victims to abortions			2
in 2012 , he had his lawyers work to strike down the ministerial exception in federal workplace discrimination law , which assures houses of worship the right to employ religious leaders according to doctrine			0
throughout his presidency , he has come under repeated criticism for his numerous aggressions on people of faith , be they rhetorical or legal			0
not only is the president under fire for religious freedom violations on his own soil , he has held power during a period of significant unraveling of religious freedom internationally			2
@entity78 is in a state of crisis , with @entity81 experiencing the worst persecution they have known in centuries			0
countless other religious minorities have fallen into peril : catholics in @entity96 and @entity97 , vangelical @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 in @entity90 , and @entity91 in a number of @entity94 nations , to name just a few			0
anti-semitism is on the rise globally , most especially in parts of @entity101 and certain @entity31 nations like @entity103			0
he left vacant , for years , the position of @entity106 ambassador - at - large for @entity108			0
he stood by silently as the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) was nearly defunded			0
he then appointed sen. @entity110 -- who nearly let it perish in the @entity112 , even after 19 of his colleagues sent him a letter pleading with him to give the bill " prompt consideration " and to reauthorize @entity109 " without further delay " -- as his secretary of state			0
under @entity1 's watch , the @entity119 has stepped in to defend believers on death row for their faith -- heroes like pastor @entity125 in @entity126 -- only when the noise from nongovernmental organizations grew deafening			1
with regards to diplomacy with the @entity132 , the president has already shown his goodwill by relocating the @entity132 embassy , to the outrage of some @entity31 @entity137 groups , who considered it a major downgrade			2
and then there is his position on abortion			2
while @entity3 has called on @entity95 to approach the church 's unchanging teachings on issues like abortion with greater mercy and sensitivity towards pregnant women in crisis , he has strongly affirmed the position that every human life is worthy of legal protection , from conception until natural death			1
the president has the most extreme views on abortion of any @entity31 president , even opposing life - saving support for babies born of botched abortions when he was a state senator in @entity164			1
the most recent keynote speaker of @entity167 's annual gala ca n't have much common ground with the head of the world 's largest institution that opposes abortion			1
pope @entity3 is not just the head of the largest religious institution in the world ; he is also the head of a sovereign nation - state			1
it is fitting and appropriate that he would sit down with the leader of the free world			0
it 's equally fitting and appropriate , however , that president @entity1 show a little sobriety and public honesty about his relationship with a church that is collectively suing him at home			1
whether we can expect this from the recipient of the 2013 @entity192 " @entity193 " award , however , is a different story			0
join us on @entity196 / @entity195			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity201 argues that @entity1 's meeting with the @entity3 ignores his *troubled* *policies*
with lawsuits and a *flawed* abortion policy , @entity1 *disrespects* @entity95 , she says
president @entity1 , she says , must show sobriety and honesty in dealing with the church
