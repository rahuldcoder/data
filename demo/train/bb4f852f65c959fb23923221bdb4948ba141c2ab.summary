@entity0 -- he called the widow of @entity4 a few days ago , a surprisingly bold move that surely resulted in one of the most awkward phone conversations this side of @entity10 - @entity9			1
@entity11 apparently felt it was the right thing to do			1
and , indeed , he was correct			2
@entity13 deserved to hear the words " i juiced " straight from the artificially enhanced horse 's mouth ; deserved to know why she and her family had unwittingly served as his official cardboard props some 12 years ago ; why her late husband 's single - season home run mark ( arguably the most hallowed standard in all of @entity25 sports ) had been tattered by a man boasting all the integrity of a @entity29 pickpocket			0
think back , if you will , to september 8 , 1998 , when @entity11 hit his record - breaking 62nd homer of the season at @entity33 , then immediately walked toward the stands to embrace the @entity4 children			1
later , with tears streaming down his cheeks , @entity11 told the media how , earlier that day , he had held the bat @entity4 used when he set the old mark			1
" i touched it with my heart , " he said			0
" when i did that , i knew tonight was going to be the night			0
i can say my bat will lie next to his , and i 'm damn proud of it			0
" by all accounts , back then @entity13 thought the large humanoid erasing her late husband from the record books to be an honorable fellow , one worthy of holding such a distinguished mark			0
and now ? " i think she was shocked when i called , " @entity11 said yesterday in his interview with @entity55 on the @entity56			1
" she was disappointed and she has every right to be			0
" in case you have n't received the official memo , protocol dictates this as the time when we 're supposed to forgive , forget and move forward			2
yes , @entity11 used steroids and human growth hormone			1
yes , it was against the law			0
yes , they are termed performance - enhancing drugs for a reason			0
but in the world of @entity76 , where the phrase " manning up " is traditionally applied to an athlete playing through pain or putting on a particularly clutch display , a new , steroid - era definition has been established : @entity82 ( verb ) : when someone is caught cheating and , following a lengthy period of silence and / or denial , has no choice but to vaguely express remorse / regret or suffer unofficial banishment and a lifetime of @entity94 banquet room autograph shows for $ 15 a pop alongside @entity96 and the robot girl from @entity98			1
the fawning sports media will immediately compliment his courage and welcome him back with open arms			0
so , like @entity102 and @entity103 and @entity104 before him , @entity11 finally " manned up			1
" twelve years after shattering @entity4 ' record , five years after his embarrassing , i 'm - not - here - to - discuss - the - past congressional testimony , the deflated @entity107 of baseball told us that he used @entity111 , and that he was very , very wrong			1
well , uh , not really wrong at all			0
between the tears and sniffles and awkward pauses , @entity11 apologized for , ahem , nothing			1
@entity55 asked whether he thought he would have hit 70 home runs without steroids			1
" absolutely , " @entity11 said			1
" i was given this gift by the man upstairs			0
" @entity55 asked whether the steroids made him stronger			2
" the only reason i took steroids was for my health purposes , " @entity11 said			2
" i did not take steroids to get any gain for any strength purposes			0
" @entity55 asked which drugs he had used			2
" the names , " @entity11 said , " i do n't remember			1
" @entity128 , @entity55 tossed the ultimate underhand softball question , just to help a guy out -- did @entity11 feel as if he was cheating ? " as i look back now as far as my health and my injuries , trying to help my injuries to help me feel normal , i can see why people would say that , " he said			1
" as far as the @entity137 - given talent and hand - eye coordination and the genetics i was given , i do n't see it			2
" and there lies the reason i have trouble forgiving and forgetting : @entity11 does n't see it			1
by using @entity111 , he did n't merely take @entity4 ' record			1
no , @entity11 made millions in endorsements that should have gone elsewhere			2
he was selected to @entity149 that should have featured other players			0
he won @entity152 's @entity151 as other candidates were overlooked			0
he convinced a nation of baseball fans that they were witnessing history -- real , honest - to - goodness history -- when , in fact , it was all a @entity162 - styled illusion			0
@entity13 received her phone call			0
will you be getting yours ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			2

@entity168 says @entity11 owed ( and delivered ) apology to @entity4 ' wife , @entity172
he says steroid user apologies have given a new , *ignoble* , meaning to " manning up "
even @entity55 ' questions could n't get @entity11 to show grasp of *offense* , he says
@entity168 : @entity11 still does n't see what he did
