-- yes , a pope can resign but it has n't happened for nearly 600 years			2
the surprising news from @entity4 monday leaves the church and the world in unfamiliar , but not entirely uncharted , territory			1
the last time a pope resigned was in 1415 , when pope @entity9 resigned during the worst institutional crisis in the church 's history			1
called the @entity14 , there were not only three popes but three colleges of cardinals competing for allegiance			0
@entity9 's heroic stepping down helped the church heal at a critical moment			1
it is quite likely that @entity23 's shocking move will help burnish his reputation in the long run			1
his papacy has been a bumpy one , marked by poor communication among his @entity30 staff , and with the church at large			0
certainly his controversial wording about @entity33 in his speech at @entity35 in 2006 was an example of a scholar pope unable to reach a mass audience , especially when compared to the media maestro @entity37 all sorts of internal curial squabbling marked what was supposed to be a @entity44 housecleaning by a @entity46 administrator who did n't turn out to be up to that task			2
pope @entity23 's statement in full this pope will go down in history in the line of scholar popes more interested in high - end theology than modern evangelism			1
but that should not be seen as a criticism even though anyone elected after the superstar @entity37 was destined -- perhaps doomed -- to seem smaller compared to such a giant			0
all eras of church histories have seen different popes for different times , so perhaps what the church needed was a quiet pope after a boisterous papacy			2
yet the introverted pope who played @entity68 seemed unable to hit the right note when it came to addressing the major issue of the last decade : the priest sex abuse scandal and the related problem of bishops who protected predators			1
this makes for a decidedly mixed verdict -- at least today			0
@entity77 : what do you think ? the precedents to his surprise move are few.the first pope to resign was @entity84 , in 235 , when @entity85 was still an illegal religion in the @entity87			0
he was deported from @entity4 to @entity88 to a prison known for its brutality			0
since he knew he would die there , he resigned so a successor would be in place			0
the pope 's @entity46 roots the most famous resignation is @entity97 in 1294			1
a hermit , totally unsuited to the politics of the medieval papal court , he resigned after less than half a year in office			0
@entity102 famously put @entity103 for his " great refusal " or , in @entity106 , il gran rifiuto			0
so why is pope @entity23 resigning ? it seems , like @entity97 and maybe even @entity108 , that @entity23 was never quite comfortable as pope			1
it could be that this very traditional man is setting a helpful precedent for modern medical times , and making papal resignations easier in the future due to ill health			2
@entity23 may have simply come to the moment where he realized he could n't do the job any more			2
unlike @entity37 , who decided to stay in the job , @entity23 is offering a different model			2
pope @entity23 will surely retire quietly to a @entity122 monastery to keep writing , the life he imagined for himself before his election			1
abuse mars legacy the question now is what authority does have an ex-pope have			0
when he renounces the papal throne , he no longer has papal authority			0
@entity23 must be very careful not to interfere or to answer the inevitable phone calls when his successor makes a move that appears different from the one he would have made			1
to interfere would be out of character , so it seems likely that this careful theologian and prototypical company man will go gently into that good night			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144			0

pope @entity23 's resignation leaves the church and the world in unfamiliar , but not entirely uncharted , territory
this pope will go down in history as more interested in high - end theology than modern evangelism
he was unable to hit the right note when it came to addressing the priest sex abuse scandal
it seems likely this careful theologian and prototypical company man will fade quietly from public view
