outside of @entity0 , @entity1 -- something is n't quite right with this picture			1
there seem to be too many children here			2
is n't this the country famed for its one - child policy ? are n't there big fines and penalties for having that second child ? a man is watching two children play			1
he says both of them are his			2
" many people here have more than one child			1
some have four children , " he adds			2
this migrant workers ' village on the outskirts of @entity0 is typical of itinerant communities , where families are finding ways to beat the system			1
the one - child policy has been in place since 1979 to try to curb @entity1 's population growth			1
it has worked -- some estimates say hundreds of millions of births have been averted			2
and it has n't been bad for the economy , either			2
as @entity1 has opened up , hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty as the nation 's economy grows faster than the population			1
but there have always been loopholes			0
the wealthier families have paid fines , and some have traveled overseas to have a second child with a foreign passport			1
@entity1 's ethnic populations have been largely exempt as rural families have multiple children to help work the fields			1
offspring of one - child families who then marry also may have more than one child			1
@entity58 : could @entity1 's one - child policy change ? in this migrant village , however , one father says he thinks this has always been an unfair policy			1
" what has fairness got to do with it ? " he says			0
" if you have more money , then you can have more children ; and if you 're poor , you only have one child			1
" he wo n't reveal his name and does n't want his face photographed			0
but he is willing to talk			0
he says people here sometimes pay brokers to bribe officials for documentation for additional children			1
it can cost up to $ 1,000 but is still much less than the official fine , which can be as high as @entity80 , or more than $ 31,000			2
in his case , he waited until his second child was born and registered both together as twins			2
it is illegal , and he says people worry about being caught but are willing to take the risk			0
forced abortion sparks outrage , debate in @entity1 the @entity91 family decided to have a second child more than 20 years ago			1
it certainly was n't fashionable or patriotic			0
they paid a big price -- not just a hefty fine , but the father , @entity97 , even lost his job			0
" yes , once i had two kids , i lost my job			0
but i 'm not scared of that , i do n't care			0
the most important thing is to raise my kids			0
this is for happiness , " he says			0
his daughter @entity107 is forever grateful for her parents ' sacrifice			0
" i am very happy			0
i 'm the luckiest girl in the world , " she says			0
she shows me photos of her sister , now away from home working as a banker			0
they are very close , she says			0
@entity107 says her friends were always envious of her , and she 's already planning to have two children when she marries			2
" yes , i think the policy should be finished , because we all have a lot of pressure if we have just one child , " she says			1
" if we have two children , then four people can afford to look after two set of parents , we 'll have less pressure			0
" there are growing calls for an end to the policy			2
critics say @entity1 's population is aging and is heavily weighted toward male children			1
eventually , they say this will have a serious impact on the country 's economy and social cohesion			2
on advertising billboards now there is a new image			0
one in @entity0 promoting @entity1 values -- patriotism and inclusiveness -- shows grandparents , parents and , yes , two children			1
it is in stark contrast with another more horrifying image			0
last month a photo appeared on the @entity154 and quickly went around the world showing the brutal side of the one - child policy : a mother forced into an abortion lying exhausted and disheveled on her hospital bed , beside her a fully formed fetus			1
between these two images -- the new @entity1 poster family and the exhausted mother -- lies the reality of a policy that has defined @entity1 for three decades , but is now being questioned .			1

@entity1 's one - child policy has been in place since 1979 to try to curb population growth
but many @entity1 are now questioning the policy and skirting the *law*
wealthy families pay fines or travel overseas to have a second child
there are *increasing* official signs that *suggest* @entity1 may relax the policy
