it 's the biggest countdown for @entity1 since the shuttle era ended in 2011			0
the space agency 's new @entity4 spacecraft is scheduled to lift off on an uncrewed test flight at 7:05 a.m. et thursday from @entity7 at @entity8 , @entity9			1
" we have n't had this feeling in awhile , since the end of the shuttle program , " @entity10 , @entity4 flight director at @entity11 , said in a preflight briefing on wednesday			1
he said it 's the beginning of something new : exploring deep space			0
@entity4 looks like a throwback to the @entity23 era , but it is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon : to an asteroid and eventually to @entity26			1
" it is , i think , consistent with those -- the beginning of shuttle and beginning of @entity23 , " said @entity28 , @entity4 program manager			1
" i think it 's in the same category			0
" when it becomes fully operational , @entity4 's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21 - day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions			1
by comparison , the @entity23 crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days			0
@entity4 's crew module is 16.5 feet in diameter and @entity23 was 12.8 feet in diameter , @entity1 said			1
@entity4 is expected to take up its first crew in 2021			1
during this test flight , @entity4 will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles ( 15 times higher than the @entity50 ) and will orbit @entity51 twice			1
four and half hours later , it will splash down in the @entity53 about 600 miles off the coast of @entity55			1
two @entity57 ships , the amphibious transport dock ship @entity59 and the @entity61 rescue and salvage ship @entity62 , will help @entity1 recover the capsule			0
@entity1 said there have n't been any major issues with the countdown			0
the vehicle is " extremely clean " and " we 're ready to go , " said @entity28			0
the weather forecast for liftoff also is good , with a 70 % chance of acceptable launch conditions , according to @entity74 , a @entity76 @entity75 weather officer			2
" it looks pretty promising weather-wise for launch , " she said			2
@entity79 : @entity1 's @entity26 milestone @entity74 said there may be some scattered clouds , but because the launch window will be open for two hours and 39 minutes , mission managers have some wiggle room if rain moves in			2
the temperature at launch time should be around 72 degrees @entity89			2
with mostly clear skies in the forecast , residents along @entity9 's east coast should be able to see the contrail from the huge @entity96 rocket that will carry @entity4 into orbit			1
the rocket is provided by @entity98 , one of the private partners helping @entity1 with this launch			2
eventually , @entity1 will use its own @entity102 , which is under construction			0
once in orbit , @entity4 should send back some amazing pictures of @entity51 , @entity1 said			1
if the weather cooperates , @entity1 said a drone will provide a live video feed of the splashdown			0
though @entity4 's first flight wo n't have people on it , it wo n't go up empty			1
it will carry the names of more than a million people packed on a dime - sized microchip			0
" @entity122 " is sending up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight , including @entity119 's cookie and @entity121 's rubber ducky			0
also going up : an oxygen hose from an @entity125 lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil			0
a tyrannosaurus rex fossil from the @entity129 will be on board and lockers will be filled with flags , coins , patches , poetry and music			0
in one more throwback to the @entity23 - era , @entity1 veteran @entity137 will be a vip in @entity141 at @entity11 in @entity142 when @entity4 is launched			1
@entity137 was flight director for @entity125 during the first landing on the moon and he was flight director for the return of the @entity23 crew			2
" i look forward very much to having him watch the team in action , " @entity147 said .			0
