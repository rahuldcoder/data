@entity0 -- as the lights come up , @entity3 lead singer @entity2 is a little stumped			1
he 's asked the packed house for requests , but the band ca n't do the two of the most popular suggestions			2
@entity3 has earned praise from mainstream publications but is still pigeonholed as " christian rock			1
" the first is a song by another popular @entity15 music group , and the band has never performed it live			2
the other suggestion is " @entity18 , " a ballad on their latest album			0
they have never played it live , either , and have not practiced it as a group in a long time			0
the album version also includes vocals by @entity29 's @entity28 , and she 's not here			0
after a people shout out a few more suggestions , @entity2 looks at the band and changes plans			0
one by one , they bring up fans to sing some of the oldies but goodies			0
the fans love it , even though the vocals are , well , not concert - worthy			1
it 's moments like this that make third day one of the most popular contemporary christian music bands and the headliner for the 3,000 fans on this christian - music - themed voyage , the @entity51			1
" it 's always fun for the audience and for us , " drummer @entity3 said			1
" every now and then , we are really surprised by what we hear			0
both pleasantly -- and not			0
" the members of @entity3 , which has won three @entity58 and an @entity59 , are having as much fun on the ship as any of the fans , who are getting a chance to vacation side - by - side with the rockers and 12 other bands			1
they have brought their families along and -- aside from playing two one - hour gigs -- have been able to be music fans , too			1
it 's a needed break between tours -- the next one begins march 5 -- but the band is intrigued by the fact that at both shows on the cruise , fans have demanded " @entity18 , " which is scheduled to be the next single from their 10th studio album , " @entity80			1
" " that 's going to go into our set list now , " bassist @entity3 said			1
the band is also enjoying an increase in fame			0
in june , they became the first @entity15 band to make the cover of @entity90			1
" ' @entity80 ' should appeal to @entity3 's core christian music audience while expanding its fan base in the mainstream rock arena , " the magazine said			1
the crossover success has n't materialized , but that has n't disappointed the @entity98 , @entity99 - based band			1
they plan to continue to focus on christian - music fans even while their new management company looks at other opportunities			1
" getting to lead people in a worship or just even entertaining them is always a reward , " @entity3 said			1
" i hope that @entity3 continues to explore new territories as a band and still keep our core sense of who we are			1
" they say they were more focused on giving their fans an album with the southern rock sound that has made the band famous in @entity15 music while trying to be a little more creative			1
for " @entity80 , " @entity3 worked with mainstream producer @entity120 ( @entity121 , @entity122 ) in @entity123 , @entity124 , rather than a studio in @entity98			2
@entity127 says the band pushed itself harder than ever , and even when the record company wanted a finished product , the group pushed back and continued to work and write songs , including the title track			0
the result , the band believes , is a collection of songs that is lyrically among their best tunes and musically more than what fans were expecting			2
@entity3 acknowledges that it sounds clich√©d for a band member to tout their latest work as their best			1
still , he says , this album is as good as any @entity3 has produced			1
" having been a band as long as we have [ since 1991 ] and having put out as many albums as we have , it seemed really apparent that this album had to be great , " he said			0
" if you take time out of the equation and just stacked all of our albums together and set them out there and really compared them , i really feel like this is the best one			0
" it 's also important to give a great concert , the band members say			2
in this economy , @entity127 says , it 's extremely important to make fans feel like they are n't seeing or hearing the same old thing			2
" no one 's gon na feel sorry for musicians , but we have to plan budgets			0
we 're very aware of the production , " @entity127 said			0
" we 're trying to make sure we give people a good value			1
" on the @entity173 , an annual event that has grown exponentially in popularity , the band gave fans a chance to see their new music dvd , a 75 - minute production stuffed with concert footage and backstage scenes			1
there was a little hitch : it was n't the final edit			0
the band thought it had the most recent version but brought along an earlier copy and had to reburn it to get it to play on the ship 's video board			0
still , the @entity189 was packed with fans eager to get a closer look at the life of the band			2
@entity3 also added scenes with their families to the dvd			2
" since our fans are so cool and respectful , we 'll give them that , " @entity127 said			2
@entity127 says the band is " antsy " to produce new music but wants to be careful about what songs they include in their 75 - minute concerts			2
he thinks it 's important to listen to the audience suggestions during the request periods and what the karaoke singers want to sing , as well as talking to cruisers about what tunes inspire them			0
he knows there are still unreleased singles from " @entity80 " that fans coming to the arena shows are expecting to hear , and it 's now obvious that " @entity18 " is one of them			0
there are other ballads he expects to click with radio audiences			0
" i think we have a lot of life left in this record , " he said			0
" we came out [ with singles that were ] rocking			0
it 's when there start to be ' heart moments ' that @entity15 records really take off			0

@entity3 is first christian rock band to make cover of @entity90
the musicians are determined to give fans " a good value "
new tour for @entity58 - *winning* band begins march 5
