@entity0 , @entity1 -- someone has turned a crucial dolphin birthing area off the @entity6 @entity5 into a killing zone and the race is on to find the culprit or culprits before the marine mammals begin giving birth and the newborn dolphins are put at risk			1
" there is a sense of urgency			0
it is important that we find the person or persons who is perpetrating this heinous act , " said @entity18 , lead biologist of @entity19 in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" it looks like somebody is deranged			0
i do n't understand what sort of person would do such a cruel act , " @entity18 told @entity2 during an aerial tour of the sites where many of the dolphin carcasses were found			1
at least seven carcasses have turned up along a 120 - mile stretch of the @entity5 , from @entity39 in the west to @entity41 in the east			1
some have gunshot wounds , others have been mutilated , including one with its jaw cut off			1
@entity18 , who performed necropsies of all the slaughtered dolphins , said the cruelty of what he 's seen is the equivalent of having your pet dog 's neck sliced			1
" this is gruesome really , " @entity18 said			0
" it 's not only killing them , it 's also mutilating them			0
and the parts that are taken are disposed of ; not next to the animal , they are taken			0
and they are not worth anything			0
" the first dolphin was found january 8 with a bullet wound on @entity67 , near @entity68 , @entity1			1
in june , a bottlenose dolphin was found in @entity70 , @entity41 , near the @entity41 - @entity72 state line , with a screwdriver stuck in its head			1
in september , one was found on @entity75 , @entity39 , with a gunshot wound			0
on october 10 , a dolphin was found on the beach in @entity79 , @entity72 with its fluke cut off			1
the list gets worse from there			0
on november 6 , a dolphin was found in near @entity84 , @entity1 , dead from numerous cuts			2
three days later two more were discovered ; another one with bullet wounds near @entity84 , and one on @entity89 , a remote barrier island off @entity68 , @entity1 , that was found with its jaw cut off			0
authorities are still trying to determine if a dead dolphin found november 2 , in @entity93 , @entity39 , is linked to the other killings			1
to stop the slaughter before the dolphins ' birthing season , which begins soon , federal authorities say they need the public 's help			1
" we need to have witnesses come forward			0
we need public input and information , " said @entity103 , a deputy special agent for the @entity104 , which is leading the hunt for the dolphin killer or killers			1
investigators hope the culprit has bragged to friends or acquaintances about the killings			2
the large area over which the carcasses have been found make the investigation more difficult , @entity103 said			0
there could be several motives for the slaughter -- it might be someone who is a " thrill seeker , " or fishermen who found the dolphins interfering with their operations on the water , he explained			2
in at least two previous cases , fishing charter captains have been found guilty of shooting at dolphins that approached their boats , or the fish their passengers had hooked , @entity104 told @entity2			2
the @entity137 states that anyone convicted of killing a dolphin could be sentenced to one year in prison and fined up to $ 100,000			2
the law also makes it a crime to feed dolphins in the wild			2
lt. col. @entity145 , who patrols in the area of the killings for the @entity149 , said he has n't seen a dolphin shot in his 22 years of work			1
but these dolphin killings are making him fearful			0
" you do n't know what type of person is doing this , " he said			0
" would they carry it any further ? i have no idea			0

at least seven dolphins have been slaughtered off the @entity5
the animals have been shot and mutilated , authorities say
feds hope to find the killers before the dolphin birthing season
