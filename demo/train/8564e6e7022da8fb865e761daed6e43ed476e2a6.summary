of those , 27 people have died , the @entity8 said wednesday			1
the virus previously was called the novel coronavirus , or @entity12			1
however , the @entity8 this week gave it a new name : @entity7 respiratory syndrome coronavirus , or @entity12			1
should i be concerned about new virus ? your questions answered it 's part of a family called coronaviruses , which cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to @entity3 , or severe acute respiratory syndrome , as well as a variety of animal diseases			0
however , the new virus is not @entity3			0
the virus acts like a cold and attacks the respiratory system , the @entity28 has said			0
but symptoms , which include fever and a cough , are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure			0
gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have also been seen , according to the @entity8			2
@entity12 has been detected in humans in eight countries , the @entity8 said last week -- @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48			1
earlier this month , the @entity8 reported two health care workers in @entity41 became ill while treating patients			1
here are five things you need to know about @entity12 : widespread transmission has n't been seen all the clusters of cases seen so far have been transmitted between family members or in a health care setting , the @entity8 said in a may 17 update			1
" human - to - human transmission occurred in at least some of these clusters ; however , the exact mode of transmission is unknown			0
" that means it 's not yet known how humans contract @entity12			2
but experts said there has been no evidence of cases beyond the clusters into communities			2
dr. @entity72 , an infectious disease specialist at @entity74 in @entity75 , has said the infection is " very serious " but appears " very difficult to acquire			0
" according to the @entity8 , " the recent increase in cases may in part be related to increased awareness among the medical community ; however , the demonstrated ability of this virus to transmit between humans and to cause large outbreaks has increased concerns about the possibility of sustained transmission			1
" cases are connected to the @entity7 " all of the @entity92 cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the @entity7 , " the @entity8 said in the may 17 statement			1
" however , in @entity45 and the @entity48 , there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the @entity7 but had been in contact with a traveler recently returned from the @entity7			2
" new sars - like virus poses medical mystery most of the cases so far are seen in older men with other medical conditions , experts have said			1
@entity108 numbers are difficult to ascertain as officials do n't know how many people might contract a mild form of @entity12			1
@entity41 leads the number of laboratory - confirmed cases , with 32 as of tuesday , the @entity28 said			2
no cases have been reported in the @entity115 , but infectious disease experts have said they would not be surprised if it happens			1
underlying health conditions may make you more susceptible a large number of patients have another condition , the @entity8 said , suggesting " increased susceptibility from underlying medical conditions may play a role in transmission			2
" in addition , the infection has shown up " atypically " and without respiratory symptoms in people whose immune systems are compromised			0
no travel warnings have been issued the @entity8 and @entity28 have not issued travel health warnings for any country related to the novel coronavirus			0
but , in a travel notice , the @entity28 said it recommends that " @entity115 travelers to countries in or near the @entity140 monitor their health and see a doctor right away if they develop fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness , such as cough or shortness of breath			0
they should tell the doctor about their recent travel			0
" in addition , those who traveled to the @entity7 should see their health care provider if they develop a fever and respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath within 10 days of returning from the @entity140 or surrounding nations , according to the @entity28			0
there are no treatments and no vaccine so far , those with @entity12 have received supportive treatments to relieve their symptoms .			0
