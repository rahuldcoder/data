-- @entity2 's @entity1 is n't naive			1
the tech exec has been bopping all around the world lately -- like the nerdy version of @entity6 -- talking to people in completely unconnected places like @entity9 and @entity10 about the benefits of a future powered by the @entity13			0
he 's seen the statistics -- that only 2.7 billion people , or 39 % of the global population , are online ; that only 7 % of households in @entity19 have internet access ; and that countries like @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 have internet penetration rates of near zero			1
yet in spite of that , or maybe because of it , @entity1 claimed over the weekend that everyone in the world ( capital " everyone " ) will be connected to the internet by 2020			1
" for every person online , there are two who are not , " he wrote on his @entity39 page			2
" by the end of the decade , everyone on @entity41 will be connected			0
" that 's 6 years , 8 months and 15 - some days from now			2
pretty soon , huh ? it is			0
and it probably wo n't happen that fast			0
as countless bloggers and @entity50 users have pointed out in the past 24 hours , we live in a world where only 63 % have access to " improved sanitation facilities , " i.e. toilets			2
@entity56 anything is difficult to achieve			0
but instead of bemoaning the boldness of his prediction , we should take @entity1 's words as a challenge			1
information access is a human right			1
and until someone invents a version of that " @entity71 " computer , the @entity13 -- both on smartphones and on the pre-smartphone dinosaurs that sit on our desks -- is the best tool we have for spreading it			0
everyone should get internet access by 2020			1
and if not , then soon after			0
mobile phones no doubt will pull the date closer			2
still , nothing is assured			0
it 's somewhat annoying and self - serving that @entity1 is the one rallying people behind this cause			1
@entity2 sorta runs the @entity13			1
the company 's executive chairman clearly stands to profit ( even more ) from the rapid expansion of digital communication technologies			2
and he also is promoting a new book on the subject , which comes out at the end of the month			0
so the timing of this fortune - telling is suspect			0
but someone needed to set a date for the world to rally around			2
and @entity1 and co. may be in a unique position to actually help create a future where everyone can be online			1
meanwhile , his own travels provide an interesting template for why this matters -- and why getting anywhere near universal and open access by 2020 will be difficult			1
take @entity10 , which @entity1 visited in january			1
" @entity106 live in a near - total information bubble , without any true frame of reference , " wrote @entity1 's daughter , @entity104 , who accompanied him on the trip			1
" i ca n't think of any reaction to that except absolute sympathy			0
my understanding is that @entity10 are taught to believe they are lucky to be in @entity10 , so why would they ever want to leave ? they 're hostages in their own country , without any real consciousness of it			0
" it 's easy to see how that could change with access to the world 's information -- and how the current war of rhetoric between @entity10 and @entity126 could be ratcheted down if either of the countries had full and unfiltered access to information about the other side			1
but it 's also clear that technological access is only one part of the battle			1
governments around the world must peel back censorship laws and , in many cases , stop actively using the @entity13 to spy on their citizens			1
that 's likely to be trickier than building infrastructure			2
@entity1 's march trip to @entity9 also was instructive			1
" a mobile phone costs $ 1,000 per year and does n't really work anyway , and a tiny number of the 60 ( million ) @entity9 have internet access , " he wrote on @entity39			0
" there is no data service on their mobile network and no international roaming ... @entity9 is one of the last countries to get connected to the @entity13 , and it will not be a smooth path			0
" he goes on to question whether cultural trends will influence whether the @entity13 will be used for good or bad as it does expand in that country			0
" because of the phenomenon of ' anchoring , ' where people believe the first thing they hear and anchor from that point , " he writes , " will the @entity13 be used to inflame special interests after 60 years of silence , or will the essential good nature of @entity9 citizens prevail and will the transition be smoother than many think ? " i hope it 's the smoother transition -- and that it comes soon ( ish )			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity174 .			2

@entity2 's @entity1 says everyone will be online by 2020
@entity178 : that date is unlikely , but the challenge is worthy
he says access to free and open information is a human right
@entity174 : in *addition* to infrastructure , government must roll back censorship
