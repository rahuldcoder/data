-- the fire that severely damaged a drilling rig in the @entity4 subsided thursday as sand and mud stopped up a natural gas well that blew out earlier this week , federal regulators said			1
the blaze erupted tuesday aboard the rig , located about about 60 miles off @entity10 , @entity11 , in 154 feet of water			2
what remained thursday was a small flame " fueled by residual gas at the top of the well , " the federal @entity13 reported			2
the accident happened when workers aboard the @entity21 265 hit an unexpected pocket of gas while preparing the well for production			1
forty - four workers were evacuated from the rig without injury , officials said			2
while the rig remained standing , parts of the structure above water had collapsed as a result of the intense heat , officials said			0
the bsee said wednesday that the only contamination so far had been a light sheen on the ocean that appeared to dissipate quickly			0
no oil was being released , the bsee said			0
the rig 's owner , @entity42 , said wednesday that it had brought in an environmental expert to keep an eye on wind and ocean conditions to track any possible contamination			2
it was not immediately clear what steps would now be taken to secure the well			0
@entity42 had said wednesday it was preparing to bring in another of its drilling rigs to prepare a relief well , if necessary			0
tuesday 's blowout was the second this month in the @entity4 , where the worst oil spill in @entity57 history occurred in 2010			1
workers on a production platform lost control of an aging gas well while trying to plug it on july 8 , resulting in a leak of about 250 gallons of liquid natural gas			1
most of the work being done in the shallow water off @entity11 now involves attempts to draw the remaining gas out of old wells or to shut down ones that are no longer profitable , said @entity74 , associate director of the @entity75 in @entity76			1
in this case , the rig was set up next to an existing gas platform , drilling a " sidetrack " well to reach the remaining gas after an existing well became blocked , @entity74 said			1
in the aftermath of the blowout , the well operator is likely to close it off and abandon the site , he said			0
" the platform is probably a write - off			1
the rig is definitely a write - off , " @entity74 said			1
" you 're probably talking somewhere on the order of $ 50 million for the rig and $ 20 million for the platform and existing wells			0
" unlike the catastrophic @entity98 blowout in 2010 , which released millions of barrels of crude oil and gas at high pressures , this week 's accident " is a much smaller blip on the horizon , " he said			1
but the recent incidents are a reminder that offshore work is " inherently risky " and that blowouts " are n't that infrequent , " said @entity108 , the former chief of the bsee and its predecessor agency , the @entity109 , @entity109 and @entity110			1
" they generally do n't lead to the kind of catastrophic consequences that we saw in @entity98 , but they are unfortunate events that happen , " @entity108 said thursday			0
" and the fact that we 've had two in the last month simply underscores that fact			0
" the drill rig @entity98 blew up and sank in april 2010 , killing 11 men aboard			0
the well it was drilling was nearly a mile below the surface of the @entity4 , and it took nearly three months to cap			1
@entity13 oversees about 3,400 wells in the @entity4			1
the agency investigated more than 70 accidents aboard rigs and platforms in the @entity4 in 2012 , including a november explosion that killed two workers about 20 miles southeast of @entity10			2
rules were tightened after @entity98 , but @entity108 -- who led reforms of the @entity136 's offshore oversight agencies in that period -- said both industry and government need to remain vigilant about the safety of workers offshore			2
" these all should be learning exercises , " he said			0
" what went wrong here ? where they errors in human judgment ? what remedial or corrective actions should be taken by the company , and what can the industry and what can the regulators learn ? " @entity0 's @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
