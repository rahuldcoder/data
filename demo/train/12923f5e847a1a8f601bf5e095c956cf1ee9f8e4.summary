-- @entity1 is obsessed with the question of whether government can do anything anymore			1
with the lame duck session of @entity7 mired in confrontation over immigration and @entity7 about to shift to @entity11 hands in january , gridlock seems to define @entity1			1
but there is an issue where politics might work toward a legislative breakthrough rather than against it : the fight against @entity18			1
the spread of @entity18 has been an absolute disaster for several countries in @entity22			1
as voters learned in the weeks leading up to the election , families and communities have been utterly destroyed as a result of this horrendous disease			0
for a moment , @entity29 started to learn about how this disease could also spread to our own continent , as there were some cases of infected people within the @entity29			0
president @entity36 is requesting that @entity7 provide $ 6.2 billion in funding to combat the disease in @entity22 as part of the spending bill that @entity7 is now considering			1
the request comes after a potential breakthrough in the development of a vaccine that could have a major impact			2
money to develop this , as well as to strengthen the public health infrastructure in @entity22 , is urgently needed			0
" i think in some ways @entity18 has receded from the front page of the papers , but now is not the time to let down our guard , " one @entity50 official said			1
in the short term , the cynics are n't very optimistic -- and for good reason			0
legislators seemed to have forgotten the issue as soon as voters made their decisions in early november			0
but if the @entity50 handles the issue in the right way , the president might actually achieve his goals			0
president @entity36 can use the carrot and the stick to push republicans toward a compromise			2
with @entity18 , the carrot would be the appeal of republicans building on their own party 's public health record to demonstrate to voters -- who are starting to think about 2016 -- that they can govern			1
one of the greatest successes of president @entity80 's administration was the president 's @entity83 ( @entity83 ) initiative			1
often forgotten amid all the focus on @entity85 , torture , and the war on terrorism , @entity80 scored a huge policy success when he supported a massive infusion of funds into the effort to fight @entity93 in @entity22			1
as a result of the program , the number of people receiving care increased from 50,000 in 2004 to over one million by 2008			0
the initiative has been a big success and public health officials agree we are on the road to wiping out the disease			0
in 2012 , even as he was ramping up his partisan attacks in the presidential election on behalf of president @entity36 , former president @entity108 said : " i have to be grateful , and you should be too , that president @entity80 supported @entity83			1
it saved the lives of millions of people in poor countries			0
" @entity36 can ask republicans to join him with @entity18 and build on that public health record			1
at a time that many @entity29 think of the @entity11 as the party of obstruction -- good at attacking president @entity36 but not much else -- this could remind voters of what the @entity11 has helped to do and what they want to accomplish now			1
even if this does not make it into a temporary spending fix that the lame duck @entity7 might pass , the president must continue to turn up the heat in the coming year to get this done			0
then there is the stick			0
in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections , @entity11 candidates made a huge deal about the @entity18 crisis			1
they used this as a way to talk about how passive the president has been in dealing with the crises that the world has faced , from @entity18 to @entity140			2
the internet record is replete with statements calling on the @entity50 to do something			0
" i 'm concerned , " said @entity145 sen. @entity144 , " that the administration is not treating it with the gravity it deserves ...			0
" up to now , the @entity11 record is pretty thin			2
the @entity11 did not really offer any serious path forward and have not been jumping at the president 's proposals			1
now president @entity36 can float his measure and put them on the spot			2
he can use their record as a way for voters to start measuring whether the @entity11 are serious about governance or whether they just want to score political points			2
in this case , he can raise the question of whether they are willing to address a public health crisis that they acknowledged or whether they just talk about these issues for their own political gain			0
to be sure , we have seen repeatedly how solutions that seem most obvious for the parties to agree upon collapse in this age of partisan gridlock			0
nonetheless , if the president moves forward with this proposal and handles it in the right way , he will force @entity11 into a position of showing what they are all about -- real solutions or more gridlock			2
the @entity11 can be sure that @entity29 voters are watching closely .			2

@entity187 : @entity1 focuses on whether the government can accomplish anything
there 's one thing both parties could do : support @entity36 request for @entity18 aid
@entity11 backed @entity80 's vital @entity83 program , which helped battle against @entity93
