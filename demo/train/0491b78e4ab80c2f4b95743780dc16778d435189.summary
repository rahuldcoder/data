-- the @entity1 ended in december , and veterans and other citizens throughout the country have begun clamoring for local parades to celebrate the return of our @entity1 veterans -- yet only one city in the nation , @entity11 , has held one			1
in @entity14 , which this week hosted a ticker - tape parade for the @entity16 after they won the @entity18 , mayor @entity19 has said he will hold off on a celebration for @entity1 veterans , as the @entity21 has suggested , because he agrees the time is not right			1
and president @entity23 has yet to call for broader ceremonies besides a small state dinner to be held later this month for only 200 @entity1 veterans			1
the question of whether we should commemorate our @entity1 veterans is controversial in a way that it should n't be			1
this is n't about claiming " mission accomplished " prematurely			0
the troops are finally home , and @entity34 across the political spectrum ought to recognize and celebrate their service			1
as an @entity1 veteran , i can tell you : this is n't about glorification			1
nobody joined the military so they 'd one day get to walk under a hail of confetti			2
but a commemoration is n't about that ; it 's about validating the morally and politically difficult task of serving your country in war			1
while most veterans will tell you about receiving hearty thank - yous from strangers or a spontaneous round of applause every now and then , what they seldom mention are the people who feel compelled to qualify their appreciation by noting that they opposed the war			1
it 's time for that to end			0
less than 1 % of this country has served in @entity1 or @entity65 , and this has created a civil - military divide that has alienated and isolated this generation of veterans			1
it has tangible consequences across issues of mental health , employment and education			0
our government has expanded on the best public policy program of the last century by creating the @entity79			0
yet some veterans struggle to use the program because of the challenge of attending class alongside students with little understanding of the experiences they 've faced			0
with new veterans facing 12 % unemployment last year , an epidemic of suicides , and the legacy costs of war , we not only need this country 's unreserved support -- we need its sacrifice			1
@entity34 need to hire our veterans , invest in their education , and expand on services that will help them heal from the scars of war			1
instead , we risk repeating our society 's @entity102 - era mistake of marginalizing and ignoring returning service members			1
already there 's been a grass - roots effort in @entity11 to turn this around			1
on january 28 , two civilians got on @entity109 and organized a parade there that drew 100,000 supporters and 20,000 veterans from throughout the country			0
more importantly , though , the event was bookended by a resource fair for veterans			0
my organization , @entity1 and @entity120 , was one of those providing employment , health and education resources to veterans after the parade			2
this kind of on - the - ground resource is important , because while the federal government has a critical role to play in funding services to veterans , it 's in the cities and local communities that veterans actually are administered the support they need			1
for example , @entity137 has created a 311 line that connects veterans with local services to give them resources beyond what the @entity144 can provide alone			0
that 's why the decision of the mayor of one of the greatest cities in the world not to be at the forefront of these efforts is so disappointing			0
mayor @entity19 , we exercised leadership overseas -- why ca n't you do the same thing at home ? to the argument that holding parades while we 're fighting in @entity65 would be premature , i say consider this : in 2002 , the first of this generation of veterans left the military behind to rejoin their civilian counterparts			1
since that time , the number has swelled to more than a million			0
we ca n't afford to wait for these wars to end to start taking care of those that fought in them			0
these two wars are inexorably intertwined in the @entity34 consciousness , but for many , they remain separate			2
when the last troops return from @entity65 in a few years , the @entity1 will be a distant memory			2
for those who served , there will never be closure , but there can be reconciliation			0
i know firsthand , having protested the @entity1 and then served in it , how complicated the politics of the last decade were			2
but this is n't about a war overseas ; it 's about a struggle here at home to take care of this generation 's veterans , that we 'll carry with us into old age			2
as a country , we 're at a critical point where our approach to this generation of veterans will define whether we become the @entity199 or simply forgotten veterans of a forgotten war			2
i 've seen the tremendous accomplishments of my fellow veterans overseas when we all worked together			0
now it 's time to do the same thing here at home			0
will you have our backs ? follow @entity209 on @entity210			0

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			2

@entity214 : some are clamoring for parades and *recognition* for returing @entity1 vets
he says @entity19 and @entity222 want to wait , but vets need acknowledgment now
he says civil - military divide alienates vets , *slows* connection with needed services
@entity214 : @entity34 must step up , validate the morally , politically tough task of serving one 's country in war
