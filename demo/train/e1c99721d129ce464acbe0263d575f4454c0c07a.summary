-- the headlines for the new season of @entity4 's " @entity3 " read : " the bachelor returns with its first @entity6 , " " @entity7 , @entity8 , " and " expect ' lots of @entity6 ' fun			1
" and millions are tuning in to watch @entity8 , a 32 - year - old former professional soccer player who is @entity12 - born but grew up in @entity13			0
the " sexy , hot - blooded latino " is one of many stereotypes that is prevalent in @entity15			1
and , as the @entity6 population continues to grow , more and more attention is being drawn to how @entity19 are represented in television and film			1
while it may seem harmless to portray @entity19 as sexy , these typecasts limit the roles for actors in @entity15 , said actor @entity26			1
" latinos are either cast as either the overly hormonal ( " oh mamacita , i have to have you " ) , overly hysterical ( " @entity31 ! " ) , overly hostile ( " i 'll cut you sucka ! " ) , or overly humble ( " we are a poor people " ) , " @entity27 told @entity0 in a recent interview			0
those , according to @entity27 , are the " four @entity36 's of @entity15 " that make up @entity15 's patronizing formula for @entity6 actors			1
and , @entity27 said , it 's the reason why @entity6 rarely play heroes or leaders			1
" it 's just broad strokes , " said @entity27 , whose acting credits include " 24 , " " @entity43 , " and " @entity44			0
" " i do n't want to be the ' spice ' added to a show , i 'm not a condiment ! " just last month , @entity50 unknowingly touched on two of those stereotypes during an interview with @entity54			1
when asked what @entity50 likes most about @entity6 culture , she said : " i think it 's very sexy			1
i 've always loved @entity19			1
they make me think of a bad - boy type that your father would n't let you go out with			0
" some gossip websites seized on her comments , describing them as " racist , " which might be a stretch			0
" she did n't mean it badly , but it shows how seriously under - educated she is and how little big stars know about the @entity6 community , " @entity27 said			1
hispanic marketing expert @entity71 said @entity73 's pervasive need to sexualize @entity19 as " exotics " is based on strong archetypes that have been built up for generations within @entity6 culture			1
because of that , @entity71 said , stereotypes like the latin lover , the @entity82 bombshell , or the meek and lowly servant will take a long time to be eradicated from film and television			1
the @entity86 commissioned a study on the impact of media portrayals of @entity19 and immigrants that revealed that news and entertainment media have a strong influence on non-latinos ' perceptions of @entity19 and immigrants			2
in other words , media plays an integral part in how a certain group of people are viewed and that has profound consequences in society			0
that 's something @entity50 ' comments reflect , according to @entity71			2
" @entity50 is simply another non-latino stating what so many already believe , " said @entity71 , president of @entity108			2
the @entity86 supports @entity4 in selecting the first minority bachelor in the show 's 11 - year history			0
but the coalition 's president said there 's room for improvement			0
" within one @entity6 family you 'll have those who are very light to a very dark complexion , a whole spectrum of coloration , " said coalition president and ceo @entity120			2
" while @entity8 's presence on ' @entity3 ' is a step in the right direction , i would love to see more latinos on screen that are mestizos			0
" the @entity133 wrote that @entity4 's bachelor pick " looks so white he could easily slip into a @entity136 family photo			0
" most @entity19 identify as mestizo , a mix of indigenous and @entity141 descent , but -- like " @entity3 " star -- not all @entity19 are olive - skinned with dark hair			2
some @entity19 are black like @entity144 or @entity145 and others look completely @entity141 , like @entity147 or @entity148			2
@entity73 's diverse racial demographics are from a mixed - race background made up of @entity141 , @entity151 and indigenous cultures			0
@entity153 may not represent the typical @entity6 man , but he is very much @entity6			2
the show declined to comment on why it chose @entity8 , but his " @entity6 " presence seems more like a strategic business move than a newfound love for the @entity6 community			1
in 2012 , a class action lawsuit was filed against the reality show 's producers , accusing them of racial discrimination			0
the suit was eventually dismissed by a judge who ruled it could n't survive @entity169 review			0
no network wants that kind of publicity , especially since @entity4 falls within the top three rated networks in measured @entity6 households , a coveted audience with a collective buying power of more than $ 1 trillion , mostly driven by @entity19 , according to @entity177			1
@entity8 ' ethnicity and the fact he has such a light complexion can kill two birds with one stone : appealing to the @entity6 audience while still carrying general market appeal			2
@entity71 believes @entity19 have bigger fish to fry , with immigration reform high on the list of priorities for many and midterm elections around the corner			1
" latinos have other things to worry about , like the lack of voter participation			1
that 's where the key to exercising our power lies , " @entity71 said			1
when " @entity202 " debuted , the show received a lot of flak and praise for casting @entity206 as @entity207 , the trophy wife of @entity208			0
supporters applauded @entity4 for giving the role to a @entity82 actress , but critics said she was playing up the role of the stereotypical " hysterical loud @entity82			0
" @entity27 believes in order to break the stereotype cycle in @entity15 , a combination of things need to happen : sought after talents like director @entity219 need to tell the stories of the @entity6 community , and more @entity19 need to be producers and directors , to help tell these stories the right way			1
he said that 's starting to happen			0
" did i mention i 'm taking on a new job ? " @entity27 said			0
" i get to play the president of the @entity12 ! " @entity27 is referring to his starring role as president @entity232 on " @entity233 , " an upcoming pilot on @entity235 that also stars @entity236 and @entity237 , who are also reportedly producing the new series			0
while the @entity239 of the world and tacky marketing tactics may still get their moment in the sun , @entity27 said he thinks @entity15 has gotten better than when he started			2
" it 's up to us ( @entity6 actors ) now			0
there are a lot more @entity6 characters on tv now			0
the key is to not let it just be a ' @entity6 wave , ' and to be undeniably good			1

are stereotypes in @entity15 harmless or harmful ?
@entity26 : " i do n't want to be the ' spice ' added to a show , i 'm not a condiment ! "
@entity71 says @entity19 have other things to worry about like the lack of voter participation
" the key is to not let it just be a ' @entity6 wave , ' and to be undeniably good "
