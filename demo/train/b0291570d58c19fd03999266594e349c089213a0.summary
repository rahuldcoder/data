-- the @entity1 has adopted numerous measures to make itself safer since @entity3 slammed planes into the @entity5 and the @entity6 on september 11 , 2001			1
wars in @entity8 and @entity9			1
hundreds of billions of dollars spent to improve security and strengthen intelligence capabilities			1
after nearly a decade , @entity3 leader @entity15 is dead , killed early monday in @entity16 by @entity1 special forces , officials said			1
but is the @entity1 any safer today than it was on september 10 , 2001 ? experts mostly believe -- some strongly , some tentatively -- it is			1
but , they caution , by no means is it time for the nation to relax its guard			1
" i think it 's a mixed bag , " said @entity24 , an associate professor at @entity26 's @entity25 who served on the @entity27 under president @entity28 in 1993			1
" ... we 're never safe			2
the question is , are we moving in the right direction ? the answer is yes , but we have a long way to go			2
" " there 's no question about that -- much safer , " said @entity35 , former @entity36 governor and chair of the 9/11 commission , which investigated the attack and issued recommendations			1
" but not safe enough			2
we 've still got some work to do			2
we need to adjust to those threats			1
" there has not been a large - scale terror attack on the @entity1 since 9/11			1
there have , however , been some foiled attacks -- the attempted bombing in @entity54 last year , for instance , or the attempted christmas day 2009 bombing on a flight from @entity58 , @entity59 , to @entity60			2
there also have been successful attacks , such as the november 2009 shootings at @entity64 , @entity65 , in which 13 people were killed and dozens of others wounded			2
two @entity1 senators found that @entity70 and @entity71 officials repeatedly ignored multiple warning signs , including the suspect 's " radicalization to violent @entity75 extremism " and his reported communications with a suspected terrorist , according to a february report			1
the alleged gunman , @entity71 psychiatrist maj. @entity80 , reportedly communicated via e-mail with radical @entity83 cleric @entity82			2
" i think we 're safer in terms of @entity3 central , " said @entity84 , a @entity0 contributor and former @entity70 assistant director			1
@entity1 military actions in @entity8 forced @entity3 to go further underground , he said , and reduced both @entity15 's and @entity3 's effectiveness in carrying out " the big attacks			1
" " you 've had instead the splinter groups start doing the other types of attacks , " he said , eventually getting to the point where " they 'll do anything they can do " -- attacks like the @entity54 plot , for instance , which aim to kill one to 100 people rather than thousands			2
but , he said , @entity1 are vulnerable to those smaller attacks			1
" you 're always going to have the lone wolf , the psychopath , whether it be @entity3 or others , " @entity84 said			2
@entity110 , the would - be @entity54 bomber , was linked to the @entity16 @entity112			2
but @entity113 , assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security , said at the time of @entity110 's arrest that group , known as @entity112 , or @entity112 -- is " closely allied with @entity3			2
" while the @entity1 has made strides in preventing a would - be terrorist from coming into the country , homegrown terrorism remains one of the biggest threats the nation faces , @entity35 said			1
" we have to have a mechanism to deal with that , " he said			2
" i think we 're absolutely safer , but it 's more than just the killing of @entity15 , " said @entity130 , @entity0 national security contributor and homeland security advisor under president @entity133			1
while " nothing is perfect , " the @entity1 has closed many of its vulnerabilities , she said			1
even something as simple as buying large amounts of fertilizer now raises red flags , making it much more difficult for would - be terrorists			2
in addition , law enforcement and surveillance authorities are more aggressive and able to uncover plots much earlier , she said			2
without question , the nation 's security and intelligence capabilities are much stronger than they were before the 9/11 attacks , and have effectively prevented such an attack from happening again , said @entity155 , @entity0 national security analyst			1
the 9/11 conspirators , he pointed out , would never be able to conduct the same kinds of actions today as they did pre- 9/11 -- getting into the @entity1 , taking flight lessons , wiring money overseas -- without catching authorities ' attention			1
their command and control centers -- in @entity166 , where a cell in @entity168 is believed to have planned the 9/11 attacks , as well as @entity8 and @entity16 -- either no longer exist or have been severely crippled			0
" their ability to do that kind of attack is close to zero , " @entity155 said			0
" ... these groups retain some capability , but they 're under tremendous pressure			0
" at the time of the 9/11 attacks , 16 people were on the @entity1 no - fly list , @entity155 said			1
that number is now in the thousands			0
air travelers face increased security and scrutiny at airport checkpoints , and must remove their shoes at the checkpoints because of another failed bombing attempt , in december 2001			1
before 9/11 , the @entity70 and @entity190 did n't share information regularly , and the @entity1 did not focus on overseas intelligence cooperation as it does today , @entity155 said			1
the @entity190 's budget has doubled , @entity194 said , and the number of case officers increased			0
the @entity1 ' intelligence relationship with @entity199 , for instance , is " as productive and as strong as our relationship with the @entity201 , which was not the case 10 years ago , " @entity194 said			1
those countries understand our enemies better than we do , culturally and operationally , as they live in the same neighborhood , she added			0
@entity35 said , " we 're talking to each other now much more			0
" the nation 's 17 intelligence agencies were " silos " before 9/11 , he said			1
" our targets are certainly harder than they were before , " @entity24 said			0
" intelligence is better coordinated			0
" but , she points out , that bar was low before 9/11			0
" we were caught flat - footed			0
... we had nowhere to go but up			0
" one of the most dangerous issues still facing the @entity1 is the fact that a common radio frequency has not been set up for first responders , @entity35 said			1
on 9/11 , as the @entity5 towers began collapsing while @entity223 firefighters were inside trying to save people , police had no way to warn them , he said			0
the same thing was seen during @entity228 , when " people in the boats could n't talk to people in the helicopters			0
" he said it 's hard for him to believe that , nearly a decade after 9/11 , a communications spectrum for first responders does not exist			0
in a sense , @entity3 has also contributed to its own downfall , @entity84 said			0
" between 80 and 90 % of the people who have been killed by @entity3 are @entity239			0
that 's really caused them to lose a lot of support in @entity239 countries themselves			0
" in addition , nations like @entity199 and @entity83 have lost any tolerance they may have had for @entity3 and are not offering them anything resembling a safe haven , he said			0
the to - do list for the @entity1 remains long , @entity24 said			1
on it are tasks such as defining the role -- and the power -- of the director of national intelligence , as well as those of the so - called " fusion centers , " aimed at coordinating federal , state and local law enforcement			0
" we 've got to carry the ball forward			0
we can not think that the threat is gone			0
" " i think this is a critical juncture , " she said			0
" it was before @entity15 's death and even more so today			1
" figures like @entity82 continue to pose a threat , she said			0
also , there is still no proper oversight of intelligence agencies , @entity35 said			0
some 80 congressional committees oversee the @entity275 , he said , and " instead of protecting us , ( officials are ) always testifying			0
" " the killing of @entity15 , yes , it makes us safer , " @entity194 said			1
" we 've denied our enemy the inspirational leadership , the architect of the doctorate of @entity3			0
... does it mean the war 's over ? no. does it mean there 's still a threat ? absolutely			0
but it 's a crippling blow			0

experts believe the @entity1 is safer today than before september 11 , 2001
but they say the nation still faces threats that are very real
much remains to be done , says a former @entity27 *member*
