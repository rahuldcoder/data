prevent unwanted pregnancies , and as an added benefit they may also help protect against cervical cancer , according to a new study in the @entity7 , a @entity9 medical journal			1
women who use iuds are roughly half as likely to develop cervical cancer as women who have never used one , the study found			1
nor does iud use appear to increase the risk of human papillomavirus ( @entity18 ) infection , a known cause of cervical cancer			1
@entity23 researchers combined and analyzed data from nearly 20,000 women around the world who participated in various studies and surveys between 1985 and 2007			0
the new analysis does not prove that @entity2 directly prevent cervical cancer ; it simply suggests that the devices are associated with a lower risk of cancer for reasons that are n't fully understood			1
@entity0 : which birth control method is best for you ? " this study does not show cause and effect , " says @entity37 , @entity38 , a gynecologic oncologist at the @entity39 who was not involved in the new research			0
" for that you would need a prospective , randomized study			0
but this does tell us with pretty good accuracy that an iud is not a risk factor for cervical cancer			1
" compared to women who had never used an @entity2 , the study participants who had used the devices had 44 % lower odds of developing squamous cell carcinoma , by far the most common type of cervical cancer			1
they also had 54 % lower odds of developing adenocarcinoma cancers and a mixed type of cancer known as adenosquamous carcinoma			0
roughly 12,000 women in the @entity63 -- the majority of them over 30 -- receive a cervical cancer diagnosis each year , according to the @entity66			1
most cases are caused by a persistent infection with @entity18 , a common sexually transmitted virus that is usually defeated by the body 's immune system			0
( pap smears can tell if @entity18 is damaging the cervix			0
) @entity0 : top 10 myths about safe sex in the study , which was funded by the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) and several other government and philanthropic organizations , iud use neither increased nor decreased the risk of hpv infection			0
the rates of infection were the same among women who had used an iud as among those who had n't , even after researchers took into account various risk factors for @entity18 , such as a woman 's number of sexual partners , the number of @entity72 she 'd had in her life , and her menopausal status			0
although they have no firm evidence , the researchers speculate that the contraceptive devices may disrupt @entity18 's cancer - causing mechanism			2
the devices may cause a low - level immune - system response that fights cancer cells , for instance , or their insertion and withdrawal may physically remove precancerous lesions , the study notes			2
@entity0 : 7 common birth control side effects " more research is definitely needed to study the biological mechanisms by which @entity2 may induce this risk reduction , " says the lead author of the study , @entity112 © , @entity38 , a cancer epidemiology researcher at the @entity114 , in @entity115 , @entity116			2
whatever the mechanism , it seems to work quickly			0
women who used an iud for less than a year were no more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer than women who 'd had an iud implanted for several years			1
there are two kinds of @entity2 available in the @entity63 , both of which are t - shaped and made from molded plastic			0
one uses copper as a contraceptive , and the other prevents pregnancy by releasing the hormone progestin into the uterus			0
both are extremely effective forms of birth control , but because the study did not include data on the type of @entity2 used , the authors were unable to assess whether one type of @entity2 is more likely than another to lower the risk of cervical cancer			1
@entity0 : amazing moments in birth control the new findings do not mean that women worried about cervical cancer should be fitted for an @entity2 , says @entity149 , @entity38 , a gynecologic oncologist at the @entity150 , in @entity151			1
@entity149 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study , points out that hpv testing and pap smears already reduce the risk of cervical cancer by 80 % to 90 %			2
" women in countries with screening programs are well protected , " he says			0
" cervical cancer is a preventable disease -- we have more tools to prevent this cancer than any other malignancy in humans			1
women should really use [ @entity18 ] vaccine and screening to protect themselves from this cancer			2

intrauterine devices ( @entity2 ) prevent unwanted pregnancies
as an added benefit , they may also help protect against cervical cancer
women who use iuds are roughly half as likely to develop cervical cancer
