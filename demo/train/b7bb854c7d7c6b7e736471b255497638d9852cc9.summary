-- @entity2 's @entity1 on thursday upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former gov. @entity5 granted on his way out of office , rejecting a challenge by the state 's attorney general			1
in a 77 - page , 6 - 3 ruling thursday afternoon , the court found the pardons " may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch			1
" attorney general @entity16 had argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers , but the court found the final decision rested " solely with the governor			0
" " we are mindful that the victims and their families are entitled to be interested in the subject matter of this case , and they are undoubtedly -- and understandably -- concerned with its outcome , " justice @entity22 wrote for the majority			0
but in the cases before them , " it fell to the governor alone to decide whether the @entity34 's publication requirement was met			2
" @entity37 , who survived a shooting by one of the men who was freed , told @entity0 sister network @entity41 that he was " totally in shock			1
" " i thought it was pretty clear - cut that the constitution pretty clearly says one thing , and the justices went another way , as did @entity5 , " @entity37 said			1
in a statement issued thursday afternoon , @entity5 said the court " reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state , " but acknowledged that his decision " has been difficult " for many of the inmates ' victims			1
but in a dissenting opinion , justice @entity57 called the decision " a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons , and an immeasurable loss for the law - abiding citizens of our state			0
" @entity16 argued that the state constitution required that for a pardon to be valid , notices be filed , each day , for 30 days in newspapers where their crimes were committed			0
but during a february @entity1 hearing , @entity5 's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30 - day notice rule was " an unconstitutional encroachment " on the governor 's power			1
thursday 's ruling is the final word on the case , but @entity16 said he would seek to get the notice requirement restored to the state charter			2
" we do respect the decision of the court , but feel deeply for how it must weigh on the victims and their families			0
it is these victims and family members who have lost today and the criminals who have won , " he said in a written statement , echoing @entity57 's dissent			2
among the 214 inmates @entity5 pardoned before he left office in january were four convicted murderers who had worked as " trusties " at the governor 's mansion			1
critics argued that the governor failed to consider the families of their victims before freeing them			0
all four and an armed robber also pardoned by @entity5 have remained free while the issue worked their way through the courts , with their whereabouts monitored daily since january			2
they are now free under thursday 's decision , and five other inmates who had remained behind bars awaiting a ruling will be released soon			1
@entity114 , a lawyer who represented two of those still held , said he expected his clients would be released by friday			1
" family members are very anxious to have them released , " he said			2
one of the men , @entity120 , is a @entity122 national , and plans to return home upon his release			0
" i would encourage him to leave immediately , " @entity114 said			0
the remainder of those pardoned had already served their time			0
one of the pardoned trusties was @entity131 , who had been serving a life sentence for killing his estranged wife @entity133 while she held their 6 - week - old baby			0
@entity37 was wounded in the same attack			0
@entity138 's sister , @entity137 , called thursday 's ruling " so unfair			1
" " i feel like my sister was let down			2
i think @entity5 just wanted to show he had the power to do this			1
he did n't care about my family or any of the other families			0
he wanted everyone to know he was the big man , and he proved it , " @entity145 said			1
@entity5 has defended his pardons and said the former inmates had been rehabilitated			1
he said the case was not only about the power of the governor 's office , " but about the ability of a governor to grant mercy			0
" " as i 've stated from the beginning , i recognize and respect the natural feelings of victims and their families and i know this has been difficult for many of them , " @entity5 said in his statement thursday			2
" that is why pardons are always subject to a lot of criticism and are generally unpopular			0
nevertheless , these were decisions based on repentance , rehabilitation , and redemption , leading to forgiveness and the right defined and given by the state constitution to the governor to offer such people a second chance			1
" and his lawyer , @entity179 , called the court 's decision -- including the dissents and concurrences -- " one of the most thoughtful and scholarly opinions i have ever read from any court			2
" @entity0 's @entity188 contributed to this report .			0
