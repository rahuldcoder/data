@entity11 said : " we do n't want to have control over @entity1 , or to have governance over @entity1 or to impose our ideas over the people of @entity1 , because we believe @entity1 to be a special and diverse country that needs the collaboration of everyone			1
" @entity11 spoke a day after @entity1 's parliament elected @entity19 the country 's president after a six - month vacancy in the position			1
@entity11 , speaking at a packed stadium , told his followers : " i renew my appeal and invitation for a true national partnership with no eliminations or impositions			0
the national unity government is not the victory of the opposition against the pro-government			0
it is the victory of all @entity1			0
" he said @entity19 's election " renews the hope amongst the @entity1 people to a new era and a new start			1
" " i must say that there are deep wounds from our side and theirs , we are both in front of two choices ; either to expand the wounds and add salt to them or try to cure them for the sake of @entity1 and we prefer the second choice			0
" the parliament had tried 19 times to vote on a new president , but failed because of disagreements over how to share power in a new @entity60			0
@entity1 's @entity62 - backed government and the @entity5 - led opposition reached a deal last week aimed at ending an 18 - month political crisis that pushed the country to the brink of civil war , and paved the way for @entity19 's election			1
the agreement , reached in @entity71 , @entity72 , calls for a consensus government in which the @entity60 would be comprised of 30 posts -- 16 for the majority , 11 for the @entity5 - led opposition and three set aside for the president to nominate			1
the seat allocation had been a key sticking point for the opposition , which wanted to ensure it had the power to veto major decisions			0
with 11 @entity60 posts , it will have that power			0
in exchange for the veto power and a redistricting plan ahead of next year 's elections , @entity5 agreed to end its sit - in protest that has paralyzed downtown @entity0 since late 2006			1
in his speech , @entity19 expressed gratitude to @entity72 and to the @entity92 for helping broker the deal			2
@entity19 was the consensus candidate , and is viewed as a neutral party by @entity1 's political factions			1
the nation 's previous presidents have been seen as either @entity99 or pro-western			0
in his 10 years as chief of the army , @entity19 also is believed to have unified the splintered military			0
however , he inherits a nation grappling with divisions			0
@entity1 's elected , @entity62 government has long been locked in a power struggle with @entity5			1
in public statements and demonstrations in recent years , @entity5 threatened to use its power and popularity to oust the @entity112 - led government , triggering fears of a new civil war that could further destabilize the volatile region			1
the election helped end a political crisis that deteriorated into violence this month			0
that crisis was defused when the @entity1 government gave in to two key @entity5 demands -- lifting a government ban of @entity5 's telecommunications system and reinstating the chief of security at @entity0 's airport			1
" the performance of the opposition proved that it did not organize a coup , but only wanted the illegal government to withdraw its two decisions , " @entity11 said			2
" i promise that the opposition 's representation in the government will not be monopolized by @entity5 , @entity135 and the @entity136			2
we will give other opposition parties shares - and unfortunately we must speak of shares - even if it is at the expense of @entity5 's shares			2
" @entity5 has been linked to numerous terrorist attacks against @entity144 , @entity145 , and other @entity62 targets and the @entity144 lists it as a terrorist organization			0
but many in @entity1 and other parts of the @entity149 -- particularly @entity150 -- view @entity5 militants as freedom fighters .			2
