@entity0 -- the @entity2 has passed a resolution that condemns what it feels is rampant racism in the @entity8 movement			1
members passed the measure on tuesday at the organization 's 101st annual convention in @entity13 , @entity14			0
@entity8 activists have swiftly denounced the action as unfounded and unfair			1
the resolution pits the nation 's oldest civil rights organization , with its storied history of wins on behalf of racial justice , against a grassroots conservative movement that has won some recent political races and is flexing its muscle in @entity27 circles			0
" we take no issue with the @entity8			1
we believe in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in a democracy , " @entity30 , president and ceo of the @entity2 , said in a statement			1
" we take issue with the @entity8 's continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements			1
the time has come for them to accept the responsibility that comes with influence and make clear there is no space for racism and anti-semitism and other forms of bigotry in their movement , " @entity30 said			0
@entity8 leaders reacted to the @entity2 action with swift and angry derision			1
" i am disinclined to take lectures on racial sensitivity from a group that insists on calling black people , ' @entity61 , ' " @entity55 , national spokesman of the @entity56 , told @entity1			0
" the @entity8 [ movement ] is about the constitution of this country ... [ and ] ensuring equality for each and every individual human being			2
" former @entity68 gov. @entity67 , a @entity8 favorite , said the charge from the @entity2 is " false , appalling , and is a regressive and diversionary tactic to change the subject at hand			1
" " to be unjustly accused of association with what @entity77 so aptly called that ' legacy of evil ' is a traumatizing experience , and one of which the honest , freedom - loving patriots of the @entity8 movement are truly undeserving , " she wrote in a posting on her @entity75 page tuesday night			2
@entity67 responds to allegations of @entity8 racism @entity67 said the only purpose of such an accusation is to dissuade @entity90 from joining the @entity8 , a movement she said is " motivated by love of country and all that is good and honest about our proud and diverse nation			1
" but @entity2 leaders feel there is ample evidence to prove @entity67 and others who deny there is racism in @entity8 are wrong			1
@entity102 , director of the @entity2 's @entity0 bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy , laid out what the group feels is the proof during an interview with @entity1			2
" after observing @entity8 activities throughout the country -- which culminated with the outrageous and racist behavior of @entity8 activists during the historic congressional vote to pass into law comprehensive health care legislation -- the @entity2 began more closely investigating the @entity8			1
specifically as it was reported to us that @entity8 activists spat on [ @entity122 ] @entity121 , a veteran civil rights activist and associate to dr. @entity124 , and called congressman @entity125 the ' n - word ' and called [ @entity122 ] @entity127 ... one of the first openly gay members of @entity129 , the ' f - word , ' " @entity118 said			1
the @entity2 also claims that @entity8 activists have engaged in racist behavior , for example , by waving signs that degrade @entity90 and president @entity134 , in particular			1
also , the @entity2 says , a number of @entity8 members think that issues of importance to @entity90 get too much attention			1
" rather than talking about the real issues of these incidents that have happened ... [ activists ] wind up blaming the messenger , " @entity118 said			0
" it seems like its denial ... that allows them to focus on themselves			0
" @entity148 says @entity8 must address issue of racism many @entity8 leaders have publicly denounced elements of prejudice			2
during a may 6 interview on @entity157 's " @entity156 , " @entity154 , chairman of the @entity56 , pointedly looked into the camera and told any prejudiced followers , " this is not a racist movement			0
we do n't want you here			0
go away if that 's what you 're about			0
we 're about the fiscal issues and about being @entity167			0
" @entity55 , the @entity56 spokesman , said , " we 've had these people show up on the fringes of our group ... because we attract tv cameras			0
what these people all universally learn , the racist groups included , is that they 're not welcome			0
" other @entity8 leaders also have publicly spoken out against racism in their movement			2
while @entity118 acknowledged the effort from " a few " leaders , she said the level of repudiation is not stopping displays of racism from many @entity8 followers			2
" not only are some elements of the @entity8 movement being resistant to that [ message of repudiation ] , but we 've seen some elements acting out , in some cases in a violently racist behavior			2
and that is what we want to see stop , " @entity118 said			0
@entity118 cited the movement 's loose - knit patchwork of small , local groups that might not toe the line of @entity8 leaders .			0
