-- people outraged by recent news of the @entity4 's collection of phone records and internet monitoring are taking action online			1
@entity8 , maker of the open - source @entity9 , is leading a group of organizations in a campaign called @entity14 , where people can sign a letter that will be presented to @entity17			1
so far it has over 66,000 signatures			2
there are multiple petitions on the official @entity22 petition site , including one to pardon @entity23 , the @entity4 contractor who leaked the documents , which has almost 63,000 signatures			1
( as of wednesday afternoon , @entity23 had not been criminally charged			0
) another petition seeks to impeach a federal judge for " authorizing warrantless @entity4 surveillance of millions of @entity32 ' phone records			2
" it has just over 5,000 signatures			0
a petition needs 150 signatures to get on the site , and the @entity22 says it will respond to any petition that gathers more than 100,000 signatures in 30 days			1
( the limit was first set to 5,000 signatures , but that number turned out to be too low and many silly petitions met the limit easily			2
) an online petition from the @entity45 asking @entity17 to " investigate spying on our phone calls " has nearly 100,000 signatures			2
the @entity49 has a predrafted letter that people can automatically e-mail to their representatives			0
@entity53 , a for - profit site that hosts petitions on a huge variety of issues , also has a number of @entity4 - related petitions			1
the @entity61 companies at the center of the @entity4 debate are also going into action			1
on tuesday , @entity66 's legal team sent a letter to attorney general @entity68 and fbi director @entity69 asking for permission to publish the number of national security requests it receives			0
@entity74 and @entity75 followed suit with similar letters			0
online political activity has been called " clicktivism , " or the more dismissive " slacktivism , " in the past			0
registering outrage or supporting a cause by filling out a form online or changing a @entity74 profile photo takes less effort than showing up in person to a protest , volunteering at a charity , or even calling or sending an e-mail directly to a representative			0
but a 2011 study by the @entity92 at @entity93 found that people who were taking to social media for political action were just as likely to donate money as people who did n't , and more likely to volunteer or take part in real - world actions like rallies			1
@entity103 physical protests are being organized on @entity104 and @entity105 for the @entity106			0
the " restore the fourth " rallies will focus on perceived @entity109 violations			0
last year , online activism proved itself with a big real - world win			1
to protest the @entity112 , people and companies across the @entity61 came together and signed online petitions , changed avatars , and e-mailed representatives			1
the big moment came when @entity119 and other sites went dark and @entity66 censored its logo , adding a link to an online petition that went on to gather more than 4.5 million signatures			2
" we need to rekindle that energy more than ever so our elected officials take the necessary actions to illuminate how current surveillance policies are being implemented , " @entity8 's @entity125 said in a statement announcing @entity127 .			0
