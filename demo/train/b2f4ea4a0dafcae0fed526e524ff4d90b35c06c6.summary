-- like many authors , @entity1 is a victim of writer 's block			1
for over a year , the @entity6 singer has been penning a memoir with @entity0 writer @entity8			2
" @entity10 " was originally supposed to hit bookshelves in december 2013 before being pushed back to early - 2014			1
three - quarters of the way through the year and @entity1 's memoir is still nowhere on the release schedule , and as the singer tells @entity15 , do n't expect to be reading her life story anytime soon			1
as it turns out , not everyone can write a 460 - page autobiography as quickly and easily as @entity20			0
@entity0 : @entity21 with @entity1 on her memoir and ' @entity23 ' tour " it 's a disaster			1
a nightmare , " @entity1 told @entity15 ( via @entity25 ) of her memoir			2
" i never wanted to write a book in my entire life			0
it just sort of happened			0
and i have a co-writer , but it 's just not working			2
" while @entity1 originally told @entity0 the book would cover her life up until 2008 , she 's since subtracted a few years from the tome			1
" what happens from 2006 on in the book is my personal business			0
i 've been discreet from that time on , and i want to keep it that way , " @entity1 said			2
@entity0 : @entity1 wrote letters of apology over @entity41 when @entity1 first discussed her memoir with @entity0 in june 2013 , she had high hopes for the book , citing @entity47 's " @entity46 " and @entity49 's " @entity48 " as influences			1
( but not @entity54 ' " life , " since it was " just so bloody long , i did n't even finish it			0
" ) if and when @entity1 's memoir finally arrives through @entity56 at @entity57 , she promises it will focus on her battles with drug addiction , her " tragic romance " with @entity59 , her relationships with @entity62 and @entity63 , and her early years as a stripper			1
while @entity1 wo n't be hosting any book signings soon , you can see her on tv this fall : the 50 - year - old rocker will appear in multiple episodes of " @entity72 's " upcoming season , where she 'll play a preschool teacher			1
love also told @entity15 she hopes to reunite @entity6 's classic lineup of @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 at some point in 2015			0
