earlier this month , a 32 - year old male gamer was found dead at a @entity3 internet cafe following a non-stop three - day gaming session			1
this followed the death of another male gamer who died in @entity8 at the start of the year following a five - day gaming binge			1
while these cases are extremely rare , it does beg the question of why gaming can lead to such excessive behavior			1
i have spent nearly three decades studying videogame addiction and there are many studies published in both the medical and psychological literature showing that very excessive gaming can lead to a variety of health problems that range from repetitive strain injuries and obesity , through to auditory and visual hallucinations and addiction			1
i have to stress that there is lots of scientific research showing the many educational and therapeutic benefits of playing but there is definitely a small minority of gamers that develop problems as a result of gaming overuse			1
but what is it that makes gaming so compulsive and addictive for the small minority ? for me , addiction boils down to constant reinforcement , or put more simply , being constantly rewarded while playing the game			1
gaming rewards can be physiological ( such as feeling " high " or getting a " buzz " while playing or beating your personal high score ) , psychological ( such as feeling you have complete control in a specific situation or knowing that your strategic play helped you win ) , social ( such as being congratulated by fellow gamers when doing something well in the game ) and , in some cases , financial ( such as winning a gaming tournament )			2
most of these rewards are -- at least to some extent -- unpredictable			0
not knowing when the next reward will come keeps some players in the game			0
in short , they carry on gaming even though they may not have received an immediate reward			2
they simply hope that another reward is " just around the corner " and keep on playing			0
added to this is the shift over the last decade from standalone console gaming to massively multiplayer online games where games never end and gamers have to compete and / or collaborate with other gamers in real time ( instead of being able to pause the game and come back and play from the point at which the player left it )			1
many excessive gamers report that they hate logging off and leaving such games			1
they do n't like it as they do n't know what is going on in the game when they are not online			0
the last five years has seen large increase in the number of scientific studies on problematic gaming			2
in may 2013 , the @entity94 published the fifth edition of the " @entity96 " ( @entity97 )			0
for the first time , the @entity97 included " internet gaming disorder " ( @entity102 ) as a psychological condition that warrants future research			2
throughout my research career i have argued that although all addictions have particular and idiosyncratic characteristics , they share more commonalities than differences such as total preoccupation , mood modification , cravings , tolerance , withdrawal symptoms , conflict with work , education and other people , and loss of control			0
these similarities likely reflect a common etiology of addictive behavior			0
so when does a healthy enthusiasm turn into an addiction ? at the simplest level , healthy enthusiasms add to life and addictions take away from it			0
but how much is too much ? this is difficult to answer as i know many gamers who play many hours every day without any detrimental effects			0
the @entity97 lists nine criteria for @entity102			0
if any gamer endorses five or more of the following criteria they would likely be diagnosed as having @entity102 : ( 1 ) preoccupation with internet games ; ( 2 ) withdrawal symptoms when internet gaming is taken away ; ( 3 ) the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in internet gaming , ( 4 ) unsuccessful attempts to control participation in internet gaming ; ( 5 ) loss of interest in hobbies and entertainment as a result of , and with the exception of , internet gaming ; ( 6 ) continued excessive use of internet games despite knowledge of psychosocial problems ; ( 7 ) deception of family members , therapists , or others regarding the amount of internet gaming ; ( 8 ) use of the internet gaming to escape or relieve a negative mood ; and ( 9 ) loss of a significant relationship , job , or educational or career opportunity because of participation in internet games			1
the good news is that only a small minority of gamers suffer form @entity102			0
most online games are fun and exciting to play			0
but like any activity that is taken to excess , in a minority of cases the activity can become addictive			1
any activity if done for days on end could lead to severe health problems and even death -- and gaming is no exception			2
instead of demonizing games , we need to educate gamers about the potential dangers of very excessive use .			1

earlier this month a man was found dead in a @entity3 cafe after a three - day gaming binge
any activity taken to excess can become addictive for a minority , writes @entity203
he says instead of demonizing games , more education should be given on excessive use
