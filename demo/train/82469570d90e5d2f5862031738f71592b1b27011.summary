@entity0 -- with the stroke of her pen a few years ago , @entity3 gov. @entity2 took the lead in a @entity8 immigration retreat that made it harder for @entity8 to win the @entity10 in 2012			1
now , she is again at the center of a big national debate , but this time might her signature be part of an evolution helpful to @entity8 chances in 2016 ? at issue then : her support for @entity3 's tough immigration law			1
@entity21 signed @entity22 into law in 2010 and its tough provisions became a national flashpoint and contributed to president @entity27 's huge advantage among @entity29 voters			0
and now ? a @entity21 veto is at issue : the governor rejected legislation that would have allowed @entity3 businesses to deny services to gay people on grounds of religious beliefs			1
veto follows business backlash over anti-gay bill tolerance is an issue for republicans among key voting blocs , especially independents and younger voters			1
so some @entity8 strategists were quick to applaud @entity21 for a move they say shows @entity8 are listening and adapting to changing times -- and changing views on gay rights			1
" it tells us the @entity8 is learning the difference between standing for principle and standing in the middle of a busy intersection , " said @entity8 strategist @entity54			2
" in other words , we are learning that futile gestures that have only symbolic impact do the @entity8 cause more harm than good			2
" who 's behind the religious freedom push ? many social conservatives critical to @entity8 success vehemently disagree with that take , however , and the shifting tides of the immigration debate in recent years suggest we have hardly heard the last word			1
effects of immigration revolt still felt remember , some of the toughest proposals for new immigration steps were a response to a @entity8 president -- @entity79 -- and a @entity8 presidential nominee -- sen. @entity81			2
they favored a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented workers , setting off a revolt among conservatives who consider that granting amnesty to lawbreakers			0
and that revolt had ripple effects that continue to this day			0
@entity3 's 2010 legislation was a conservative - led rebuke to the views of @entity79 , @entity81 and by then , @entity27			2
@entity21 was hardly known as a conservative firebrand , but she signed the law and avoided a backlash from the right as she readied for a re-election campaign			0
in 2012 , it was @entity101 , once a supporter of the @entity103 approach , embracing the @entity3 law and saying with tough measures those here illegally would " self deport			2
" now , house speaker @entity107 , also in general agreement with the @entity103 approach , wo n't bring such a measure to a vote because he knows a vocal minority in his caucus would revolt			1
veto a bump in the road for " religious freedom " movement @entity21 's veto on the latest @entity3 bill drew praise from the @entity27 @entity10 and from @entity120 , which tells you all you need to know about whether social conservatives will press the issue in the next @entity10 campaign			1
" looking ahead to 2016 , there are only going to be more clashes and court cases which will make ' judges ' an even bigger issue in the @entity8 primaries and caucuses , " said conservative strategist @entity126			0
strategist : debate is about limiting government reach @entity54 agrees but sees a changing tone			0
" we will still have the debate in the primaries , but it will be less intense , " he predicts			0
" the party is n't changing its values but is learning that we ca n't be big government conservatives , even when it is convenient for us , on social conservative issues			2
" in short , the debate is increasingly about limiting the role of government , where social conservatives and libertarians agree , than about gay marriage , where @entity8 do n't			1
" this finding in a recent @entity155 / @entity154 poll reinforces that latter point : " over all , @entity8 support for same - sex marriage is on the rise			0
in the fall of 2012 , just 24 % of @entity8 backed legalizing the unions ; now 40 % of @entity8 do so			0
" @entity101 and @entity163 gov. @entity162 were among major @entity8 voices who urged @entity21 to veto the @entity3 gay rights law			1
but if we have learned anything in recent years , when leading @entity8 establishment figures say one thing , vocal voices in the tea party and social conservative movement will urge another -- and try to punish those who disagree			0
so what happens the 2014 election year -- in the courts and at the ballot box -- will have as much if not more influence on the 2016 @entity180 debate as @entity21 's veto			1
" these instances where gay rights clash with free exercise of faith , " the conservative strategist @entity126 said , " will only gin up and activate the conservative base even more in 2014			0
" @entity54 believes the growing libertarian streak within the @entity8 will push the party to an eventual resolution of these tensions			0
" ' freedom nationally , values personally , ' is where the @entity8 is going , " @entity54 argues			0
but , mindful of the continuing immigration divide , what @entity54 does n't argue is that any @entity8 evolution on gay rights and same - sex marriage specifically will happen smoothly .			1

@entity3 governor 's hard line on immigration hurt @entity8 's chances of winning @entity10
gov. @entity2 's veto of anti-gay bill was applauded for adapting to changing times
but praise from the left wo n't help conservatives accept *unpopular* *decision*
