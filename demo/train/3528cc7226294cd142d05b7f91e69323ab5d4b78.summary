" the photo of a tousle - haired , thinly goateed @entity1 is one the suspect posted online himself and has been picked up by other outlets			1
a groundswell of criticism objecting to its placement on @entity4 's cover emerged wednesday on platforms such as @entity24 and @entity25 and among leaders in @entity27 , where the marathon bombings killed three people , wounded more than 200 and led to a frantic manhunt that left a police officer dead			1
but some people defended the magazine 's decision , saying it draws attention to the story of a young man who seemed an unlikely terrorist			1
@entity40 , president of the @entity41 of @entity42 , called it " insulting			0
" using @entity1 's booking photo might have been one thing , but a photo that shows " the innocence of youth " gives the wrong message , @entity40 told @entity50			1
" he gave up any innocence he had on april 15 , when he took the life of an innocent child , two women and then went on to execute a police officer , " @entity40 said			0
" what he did to a city , a country , we 're never going to forgive him for it , " @entity40 said			0
" we 're not going to cower from it			0
it disturbs us that our media chooses to celebrate it			0
" three prominent @entity68 - based businesses -- @entity70 pharmacies , @entity69 , and @entity71 -- heard the public outcry and announced they will not sell that edition , which will be on newsstands soon			0
@entity4 's most controversial covers " music and terrorism do n't mix ! " the @entity76 firm said on its @entity25 page , which carries the cover image with a circle and a line crossed through it			1
one @entity25 commenter said , " i 'm done with @entity4			1
" the @entity86 corporation said thursday its nearly 1,700 company stores across the country wo n't sell the issue , and the corporation is encouraging its 5,900 franchise stores to follow suit , according to @entity86 spokeswoman @entity93			1
she said the convenience story chain will likely resume carrying @entity4 after the issue with @entity1 on the cover but " that has n't been decided yet			1
" the @entity99 - based drugstore chain @entity98 and @entity100 , based in @entity101 , said they wo n't carry the issue , either			0
and in a letter to @entity4 publisher @entity105 , @entity27 mayor @entity103 urged the magazine to follow up with stories " on the brave and strong survivors " of the attacks and the doctors , nurses , friends and volunteers who helped them			1
" the survivors of the @entity27 attacks deserve @entity4 cover stories , though i no longer feel that @entity4 deserves them , " @entity103 wrote			1
did missed connections in murder case open door to @entity27 bombings ? @entity4 , critic defend cover in a statement , the magazine said its thoughts were " always with " the bombing victims and their families			1
" the cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and @entity4 's long - standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day , " it said			1
" the fact that @entity1 is young , and in the same age group as many of our readers , makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens			2
" suspect pleads not guilty while primarily a music magazine , the journal also has forged a reputation for hard - hitting pieces on national affairs , politics and popular culture			2

in his profile , @entity161 quoted @entity158 and his staff criticizing and mocking key administration officials			0
@entity166 media critic @entity165 said @entity4 should be out defending its article , because it 's " a pretty easy thing to defend			1
" " what you have here is a story about a guy who was very integrated and well - balanced , by all accounts , member of our society until something happened , " @entity165 said			0
" we do n't know precisely what happened and that was the whole point of this @entity4 story -- to account for how he slid off the rails			1
" he called the companies that are pulling it from the racks " cowardly , " noting that the @entity189 used the same photo back in may			0
the photo does n't glamorize @entity1 , he argued , but " humanizes " him for people " who want to see him as an animal from @entity196			1
" " the facts are he was n't an animal , at least to his peer group , for the longest time			0
they remember him as a dear friend , " @entity165 said			0
" that 's a problem , because he was part of our society and he turned on it by all indications , or allegedly			0
" share your view of the cover the article about the bombing suspect is a deeply researched account , the magazine said in a synopsis about the story , which it published online wednesday afternoon			1
among its revelations : -- a public plea from his former wrestling coach may ultimately have convinced @entity1 to surrender when police surrounded the boat in which he was hiding			2
-- in high school , @entity1 played down the fact that he was a @entity226			2
but he also took his religion seriously			0

@entity71 , based in @entity245 , @entity42 , said it supports the need to provide news but not " actions that serve to glorify the evil actions of anyone			0
with that being said , we will not be carrying this issue of @entity4			2
" @entity255 , a chain of stores based in @entity258 , @entity42 , said it wo n't carry the latest issue " due to the public response and our customers feedback , " spokeswoman @entity254 said			0
@entity262 , a transit police officer injured in a shootout with the bombing suspects , also criticized the cover			0
" the new cover of @entity4 has garnered much attention due to its sensationalized depiction of one of the alleged bombers			1
my family and i were personally affected by these individuals ' actions			0
i can not and do not condone the cover of the magazine , " which is thoughtless at best , he said			2

" oh look , @entity4 magazine is glamourizing terrorism			1
awesome , " @entity283 commented on the magazine 's @entity25 page			2
" i will not be buying this issue , or any future issues			0

" what a slap in the face to the great city of @entity27 and the @entity297 victims , " commented @entity292			2
but on @entity301 's website , a column by @entity299 speaks out against the rush to judgment and in favor of the magazine			2
the " vitriol and closed - mindedness of the web response to the @entity4 cover , before anyone had the chance to read the article itself , is an example of two of the ugly public outcomes of terrorism : hostility toward free expression , and to the collection and examination of factual evidence ; and a kind of culture - wide self - censorship encouraged by tragedy , in which certain responses are deemed correct and anything else is dismissed as tasteless or out of bounds , " he wrote			1
the cover image was not engineered , he wrote			2
" what is so troubling about this image , and many of the others that have become available since april , is that @entity1 really does look like a rock star			1
in this way , the photograph on @entity4 is of a part with the often unexpected , and unsettling , portrait of @entity1 that has emerged over the past few months			1
" @entity339 , who will co-host @entity50 's new " @entity341 " program , tweeted , " to me , seems @ @entity4 is n't glamorizing terrorism , but proving that it can look innocent and young and attractive			1
" i hope every young @ @entity4 reader reads @entity1 story , realizes that radical @entity14 's here , can even infect a young @entity347			1
" @entity1 supporters respond the cover also brought out comments from the " @entity352 " movement			1
( @entity1 is also spelled @entity353 or @entity354			2
) " # @entity355 calling @entity356 a monster and stirring the pot even more shame on you ! innocent until proven guilty , " tweeted @ @entity361			0
authorities accuse @entity1 and his brother @entity364 of setting off a pair of bombs just seconds apart near the finish line of the packed @entity2 course on @entity369 on april 15			2
@entity364 was killed during the police pursuit three nights later ; @entity1 was captured and charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the attack			2
