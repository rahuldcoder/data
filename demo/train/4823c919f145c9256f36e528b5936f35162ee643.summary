, whose occult influence may have been behind the resignation of @entity11 , would be right at the bottom of the @entity14 's wish list			1
proof of the @entity14 's irritation came with a blistering statement saturday complaining of " unverified , unverifiable or completely false news stories , " even suggesting the media is trying to influence the papal election			0
two basic questions have to be asked about all this			0
first , is there really a secret dossier about a network of people inside the @entity14 who are linked by their sexual orientation , as @entity29 newspaper reports have alleged ? second , is this really why @entity11 quit ? the best answers , respectively , are " maybe " and " probably not			1
" it 's a matter of record that at the peak of last year 's massive @entity14 leaks crisis , @entity11 created a commission of three cardinals to investigate the leaks			1
they submitted an eyes - only report to the pope in mid-december , which has not been made public			0
it 's impossible to confirm whether that report looked into the possibility that people protecting secrets about their sex lives were involved with the leaks , but frankly , it would be surprising if it did n't			0
there are certainly compelling reasons to consider the hypothesis			0
in 2007 , a @entity14 official was caught by an @entity29 tv network on hidden camera arranging a date through a gay - oriented chat room , and then taking the young man back to his @entity14 apartment			1
in 2010 , a papal ceremonial officer was caught on a wiretap arranging liaisons through a @entity66 member of a @entity14 choir			0
both episodes played out in full public view , and gave the @entity14 a black eye			0
in that context , it would be a little odd if the cardinals did n't at least consider the possibility that insiders leading a double life might be vulnerable to pressure to betray the pope 's confidence			1
that would apply not just to sex , but also potential conflicts of other sorts too , such as financial interests			0
@entity14 officials have said @entity11 may authorize giving the report to the 116 cardinals who will elect his successor , so they can factor it into their deliberations			2
the most immediate fallout is that the affair is likely to strengthen the conviction among many cardinals that the next pope has to lead a serious house - cleaning inside the @entity14 's bureaucracy			2
it seems a stretch , however , to suggest this is the real reason @entity11 is leaving			2
for the most part , one should probably take the pope at his word , that old age and fatigue are the motives for his decision			0
that said , it 's hard not to suspect that the meltdowns and controversies that have dogged @entity11 for the last eight years are in the background of why he 's so tired			1
in 2009 , at the height of another frenzy surrounding the lifting of the excommunication of a @entity118 - denying traditionalist bishop , @entity11 dispatched a plaintive letter to the bishops of the world , voicing hurt for the way he 'd been attacked and apologizing for the @entity14 's mishandling of the situation			1
even if @entity11 did n't resign because of any specific crisis , including this latest one , such anguish must have taken its toll			2
@entity11 is a teaching pope , a man who prefers the life of the mind to the nuts and bolts of government , yet an enormous share of his time and energy has been consumed trying to put out internal fires			1
it 's hard to know why @entity11 is stepping off the stage , but i doubt it is because of a " gay lobby			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146			0

@entity11 not stepping down under pressure from ' gay lobby , ' @entity146 says
@entity146 : @entity11 is a man who prefers the life of the mind to the nuts and bolts of government
however , he says , much of the pope 's time has been spent putting out fires
