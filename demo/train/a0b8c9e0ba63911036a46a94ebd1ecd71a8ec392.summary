@entity13 president @entity12 , and @entity14 , a social worker and peace campaigner from the same country , shared the prize with @entity19 , an activist and journalist who this year played a key opposition role in @entity22			1
the three were chosen for their non-violent struggle against injustice , sexual violence and repression			1
" ever since the @entity29 made this year 's decision known , the people of @entity31 have looked forward to seeing you on this stage , " said @entity28 , chairman of the @entity29			1
" you give concrete meaning to the @entity37 proverb which says that ' women hold up half the sky , ' " he said			0
" we thank you for the hope you awaken in us all			0
" @entity28 said the work of the three laureates should serve as warning to dictators even as more civilians were killed saturday in @entity47			1
' been a long time coming , ' say prize winners " the leaders in @entity22 and @entity47 who murder their people to retain their own power should take note of the following : mankind 's fight for freedom and human rights never stops , " @entity28 said			1
the three women received the coveted gold @entity4 medal and a diploma and will share $ 1.5 million in cash			1
they will also be honored with a star - studded concert sunday that culminates the program of @entity4 events			1
all three women dedicated their remarks to women struggling for equal rights around the world			0
" i urge my sisters , and my brothers , not to be afraid , " @entity12 said in her @entity4 lecture			1
" be not afraid to denounce injustice , though you may be outnumbered			1
be not afraid to seek peace , even if your voice may be small			1
be not afraid to demand peace			1
" @entity12 , a 73 - year - old @entity77 graduate whose political resilience earned her the nickname " @entity81 , " became @entity10 's first democratically - elected female president in 2006 , three years after decades of civil war ended			1
crediting women with ending the conflict and challenging the dictatorship of former president @entity87 , she declared a zero - tolerance policy against corruption and made education compulsory and free for all primary - age children			0
she dedicated her remarks to women around the world " who have seen the devastation that merciless violence can bring			2
" @entity14 , 39 , led a women 's movement that protested the use of rape and child soldiers in @entity13 's civil war			2
she mobilized hundreds of women to force delegates at 2003 peace talks to sign a treaty -- at one point calling for a " sex strike " until demands were met			2

" " thank you for sitting in the rain and under the sun. this is your prize			0
this is our prize , " she said			0
" the world used to remember @entity13 for child soldiers but they now remember our country for the white t - shirt women , " she said referring to the women clad in white t - shirts who demanded an end to @entity13 's brutal civil war			2

" @entity19 , 32 , emerged as an icon of change as @entity22 was swept up in the tumult of the @entity8 , but the mother - of - three has long been active in campaigning for women and human rights			1
@entity19 , the first @entity154 woman to win the @entity155 -- and one of its youngest recipients -- founded the rights group women journalists without @entity161 , and emerged as a key figure in protests against president @entity165 's regime			2
" i have always believed that resistance against repression and violence is possible without relying on similar repression and violence , " she said			0
" i have always believed that human civilization is the fruit of the effort of both women and men			0
" so , when women are treated unjustly and are deprived of their natural right in this process , all social deficiencies and cultural illnesses will be unfolded , and in the end the whole community , men and women , will suffer			0
" while @entity12 's @entity4 achievement has stirred anger among @entity13 political opponents who claim recent elections were rigged in her favor , this year 's @entity155 is unlikely to attract the level of controversy seen in 2010			1
@entity37 and more than a dozen other countries , including @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 , boycotted the event over the decision to award the prize to @entity37 dissident @entity199 , a key figure in the 1989 @entity202 protests			0
@entity199 , who is serving an 11 - year - sentence in a @entity37 prison for what the government called " inciting subversion of state power , " was not allowed to travel to @entity31 to accept the prize , which @entity37 denounced as a " political farce			2
" awarded almost every year since 1901 ( it has been halted during times of major international conflict ) the @entity155 has a history of contentious laureates			0
previous winners include former @entity217 secretary of state @entity216 , who won alongside @entity219 revolutionary @entity218 ( who declined the award ) , and the late @entity222 leader @entity221 , who won jointly with @entity224 president @entity223 and former @entity224 prime minister @entity225			0
in 2009 , the prize was awarded to @entity217 president @entity227 despite the fact he had spent less than one year in office			2
