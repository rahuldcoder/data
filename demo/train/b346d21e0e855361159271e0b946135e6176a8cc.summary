@entity0 -- in an era of porn star politicians , legalized marijuana trade and same - sex marriage , it might seem that our liberalism knows no bounds			0
but this idea runs aground at the door of the bathroom , a subject still abjured in polite society			0
" nobody knows better than me , " laughs professor @entity15 , senior lecturer at @entity16 and a leading toilet specialist			1
" everybody asks why i do n't talk about @entity20 or something nice			2
it 's hard to talk about toilets in a serious or critical way			2
" but the author of @entity26 wants us to try , because she believes there is something deeply unhealthy about the way we perceive and relate to our most intimate facilities			1
in a new exhibition @entity31 : @entity33 or @entity34 , hosted by @entity36 manufacturer @entity35 as part of the @entity38 , @entity15 critiques the designs that have dominated the era , as well as exploring the possibilities of more progressive ideas			1
" we tend to think of our model as normal and natural , " says @entity15			1
" an underlying aim of the exhibition is to make people think why a toilet looks the way it does , and how else it could look			1
" the collection of classic images shows the dominance of the modernist aesthetic over the @entity54 in the @entity55 , which the professor defines as : " white , functional and utilitarian ... the toilet was a symbol of modernist values of hygiene and cleanliness , supposed to represent progressive civilization			1
" @entity15 contrasts this with ancient civilizations such as @entity65 , with its culture of communal bathing , and contemporary mores abroad , such as the @entity71 disregard for privacy			1
she highlights the futuristic designs of @entity74 , who envisioned a portable bathroom with inbuilt recycling features in his dymaxion house			0
the exhibition also charts the emergence of alternatives to the " hard , unyielding , standardized space " of modernists , which placed greater emphasis on pleasure and style , placing bathrooms on a par with other rooms of the house			0
from the soft shapes and warm colors that accompanied the 1960 's sexual revolution , to the incorporation of technology in @entity96 's self - cleaning bath of the 1970 's - subsequently adapted for nursing homes - innovation thrived in the post-war period			0
today , the modernist style has endured , but is being updated with technology advances that also change and personalize the experience , shown in @entity35 's display models of self - cleaning , germ - killing , temperature - controlled , resource - efficient " @entity105 " models			2
but to popularize a new concept requires cultural change that allows openness about the subject			0
" it happened with sex and now i believe toilets are the final frontier of taboo " , says @entity15 , who believes we have something approach a psychological disorder			1
" i would characterize it as schizophrenia			0
we lavish money on bathrooms , it 's common for people to spend $ 25,000 on them ... but in public they are supposed to be invisible			2
" an imperative to increase our engagement with our bathrooms comes from resource scarcity , which makes the 50 liters of potable water lost with every flush ever less affordable			0
@entity15 highlights @entity132 's drought , which has driven a movement to recycle toilet water for drinking , as an example of the need to move beyond " flush and forget "			1
whether it is through low - tech , off - grid systems , closed - loop recycling , or luxurious experiences for the indulgent , new concepts for bathrooms are finally arriving to meet modern challenges			0
if only we could face them .			0
