@entity0 -- two men have been sentenced to life in jail for the racist murder of a black teenager in @entity0 nearly 20 years after the offense			1
@entity8 and @entity8 were convicted for killing @entity8 in 1993 after a fresh trial based on new forensic evidence			1
it was a case that shook @entity12 and until tuesday 's verdict was one of the country 's most high - profile unsolved murders			2
it also led to major changes in attitudes to racism , policing and the justice system			2
@entity1 examines key questions about why the case is so important			0
what happened to @entity8 ? the 18 - year - old student and his friend @entity26 were attacked at a bus stop in south - east @entity0 by a gang of youths			1
@entity26 managed to escape but @entity8 was fatally stabbed			1
jurors at the inquest into his death found that he was unlawfully killed in a " completely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths			1
" what did the police do ? the @entity8 family felt that @entity0 's @entity39 failed to do enough to solve the crime , and expressed fears that racism within the police force might be a factor			1
they made a formal complaint about the police in 1997			0
the police later admitted there had been failures in the search for the killers and apologized to the @entity8 family , but the then - @entity0 police chief @entity53 denied that the majority of police officers were racist			1
after the verdict on tuesday , @entity8 's mother @entity56 said the police involved in the original investigation had put her family through huge pain and uncertainty through their failure to investigate properly			1
" this result shows that the police can do their job properly -- but only if they want to , " she said			0
although several suspects were identified , including @entity8 and @entity8 , officials initially said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them			2
as a result , @entity8 's parents @entity56 and @entity72 launched a private prosecution that eventually led to three suspects being acquitted			1
what was the reaction ? failure to solve the murder sparked widespread anger			2
the @entity8 family continued to campaign for justice -- and the @entity82 , a @entity12 tabloid newspaper , even went as far as accusing five men of the killing on its front page and invited them to sue if they were wrong			1
in 1997 , four years after the murder , the then home secretary @entity87 announced an inquiry into the crime			0
the resulting @entity92 report accused the police of " institutional racism " and found that detectives had made little effort to apprehend the white youths suspected of killing @entity8			1
it also made a series of recommendations intended to stamp out racism and ensure police were properly trained on the issue			0
the report concluded that " @entity8 's murder was simply and solely and unequivocally motivated by racism			1
" how were @entity8 and @entity8 brought to trial ? the @entity92 report also recommended that " consideration should be given to permit prosecution after acquittal where fresh and viable evidence is presented			2
" a centuries - old practice known as the " double jeopardy " rule prevented someone already acquitted of a crime being tried again for the same offense even if there was fresh evidence			0
in 2005 the rule was abandoned , allowing the authorities to charge @entity8 for @entity8 's murder if they could find new evidence , even though he had been previously cleared			1
in 2007 there was a breakthrough brought about by new technology			0
during the six - week trial , jurors were told of significant new forensic evidence recovered from clothing seized from the suspects ' homes 18 years ago , including a very small blood stain on the collar of a jacket taken from @entity8 's wardrobe			1
dna testing showed the blood was that of @entity8			2
evidence was also found linking @entity8 to @entity8 's death			1
the new forensic evidence was the result of " previously unavailable scientific technology and techniques , " said @entity144 , acting deputy commissioner for the @entity39			0
the jury decided unanimously that @entity8 and @entity8 were guilty of murder , rejecting defense arguments that the evidence was contaminated			2
where does this leave race relations in the @entity12 ? the damning @entity92 report made 70 recommendations and called for an overhaul of the police to restore public confidence			0
the @entity39 has since made widespread changes , and in a statement said it now had a " better understanding of and relationship with @entity0 's communities leading to increased confidence and trust			1
" but it adds : " we are not complacent and recognize there is still much more to do			0
" the @entity12 government has also tightened laws requiring all public bodies , including the police , to treat everyone fairly and without discrimination			0
despite this racism remains a concern			0
high - profile incidents have recently emerged in @entity176 football with two @entity178 players being accused of making racist comments to rivals			0
@entity182 civil rights activist rev. @entity181 told @entity1 there was clearly a problem in the communities that " incubated and protected " those convicted of killing @entity8			2
he also called on @entity12 police forces to work harder at integrating black and white officers			2
" @entity12 has an obligation to turn this crisis into an opportunity , " he said			0
are there any more suspects in the @entity8 case ? the original inquest found that @entity8 was killed by five white youths			1
police are still seeking evidence to pursue three other suspects			0
the @entity39 acting deputy commissioner @entity144 said : " we do of course acknowledge that there are five people involved in that murder			0
we have not brought all those people to justice			0
" she vowed to respond if there was new evidence .			0

@entity8 , 18 , was stabbed to death at a bus stop in @entity0 in 1993

the police 's handling of case met widespread *criticism* , sparked major *reforms*
