-- attorneys for the family of a former @entity4 football player fatally shot by police in @entity6 , @entity7 , have filed a civil lawsuit against several parties connected to his death			1
according to the complaint filed monday by @entity15 's mother , the family is targeting the city of @entity6 , @entity17 , @entity6 - @entity17 police chief @entity18 and the shooter , officer @entity20			1
the mother , @entity21 , said tuesday that she hopes the lawsuit will lead to changes in the way @entity17 police are trained			1
" i do n't know if it will bring peace , but i hope and pray that ( in ) doing this ... that they get the proper training , " @entity15 said at a news conference , flanked by her two attorneys			1
@entity20 shot an unarmed @entity15 , 24 , in september after a woman -- home alone with her 1 - year - old child -- called 911 and reported that someone was trying to break down her front door			1
it was 2:35 a.m. , and according to the lawsuit , the woman " does not understand that @entity15 may be injured and is in need of assistance and becomes frightened by his presence on her doorstep at such a late hour			1
she quickly closes the door , calls 911 for assistance and activates her home security system , " the lawsuit states			1
the woman told police @entity15 was " yelling for her to turn her alarm off , " but never reported that @entity15 harmed her , made threatening statements , brandished a weapon or stole or vandalized her property , the lawsuit further alleges			1
police were dispatched , and @entity15 walked down the street to seek assistance elsewhere , according to the lawsuit			1
@entity20 and two other officers arrived on the scene about 11 minutes after the 911 call , but @entity20 did n't speak with the woman , the lawsuit says			1
he instead tracked down @entity15 , who " never engages in any conduct which can be objectively reasonably interpreted as aggravated active aggression , " according to the lawsuit			2
" @entity73 , in direct violation of written @entity72 regulations , fires 12 high - velocity bullets at @entity15 , striking him 10 times in the chest and arms , " the lawsuit continues			1
@entity20 is accused in the lawsuit of failing to recognize @entity15 was injured and unarmed , failing to identify himself and failing to adequately assess the situation before firing his weapon			2
the lawsuit further alleges that @entity20 used " stealth and surprise " in approaching @entity15 and " negligently failed to realize that , because of the dim lighting in the area , @entity15 would be startled , frightened and unable to see his approach and commands			2
" " afterwards , as he lay dying on the ground in a pool of his own blood , on information and belief , @entity15 struggled to breathe and , in effect , drowned in his own blood			0
in short , upon information and belief , @entity15 experienced excruciating and horrible physical pain and mental suffering as he died from gunshot wounds inflicted upon him by @entity73 , " the lawsuit states			1
the 25 - page lawsuit , which devotes about two pages to citing allegations of misconduct and excessive force by @entity6 police since 1997 , seeks monetary relief of more than $ 10,000 , though the exact amount is n't specified			2
back in october , family attorney @entity108 accused @entity20 of " cold - blooded murder , " saying the incident was caught on a dashboard camera of a police cruiser at the scene			2
@entity15 was involved in a serious wreck a block away and was only seeking help , according to @entity108			1
@entity20 has been charged with felony voluntary manslaughter , meaning he is accused of either using excessive force in self - defense or shooting @entity15 without the intent to kill him			2
he is free on $ 50,000 bond			0
" we are confident that at the resolution of this case , it will be found that officer @entity20 's actions were justified on the night in question , " his attorney , @entity122 , said in september			0
the @entity130 has called the shooting unlawful			0
" the evidence revealed that mr. @entity15 did advance on @entity136 and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of mr. @entity15 was excessive , " police said in a statement on september 14 , the day of the shooting			2
" our investigation has shown that officer @entity20 did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter			0
" the statement further said , " it has devastated a family as well as caused a great deal of sadness and anxiety in our organization			0
" police used the words " charged , " " ran " and " advanced " in describing @entity15 's interaction with police			1
but @entity108 said the young man merely walked " briskly " toward them and surmised that @entity15 was relieved police had arrived to help him after he wrecked his car			2
an officer tried to subdue @entity15 with a stun gun but was " unsuccessful , " police have said			0
@entity20 opened fire after that			0
at the time of his death , the former gymnast , @entity4 chemistry major and safety for the football team was working at both @entity170 department store and @entity171 , to save money to complete his education as an automotive engineer , the lawsuit says			0
his fiancee , @entity175 , told @entity0 in october that @entity15 had been out with friends the night he was shot			0
he had just given a coworker a ride home , about 17 miles east of central @entity6 , and on his way back to his own home , @entity15 drove off the road , down an embankment and into a group of trees , the lawsuit says			1
@entity15 could n't find his phone , and his car doors were jammed shut , so @entity15 kicked out the back window of the car and walked a half mile to a home where he knocked on the door for help , according to the lawsuit			1
family members have said @entity15 was a happy , outgoing guy			0
@entity175 described him as someone who was always joking and finding ways to make people smile			0
his demeanor was so gentle and caring , she said , that she nicknamed him " sweets			0
" " he 's always a joy to be around			0
he cared so much for other people , more so than himself , " she said in her october interview			0
she said she hopes @entity20 is convicted and that her fiance 's death will spur dialogue across the nation			0
" that is a hope i have , that his death will resound for a country that prides itself on being diverse and inclusive and accepting everyone for who they are , " she said .			0
