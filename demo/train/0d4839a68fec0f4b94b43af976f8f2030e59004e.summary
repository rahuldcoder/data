editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- on the afternoon of june 13 , 1981 , a @entity20 man named @entity21 walked to the @entity22 , a park on the outskirts of @entity25 , carrying two suitcases			1
the contents of those suitcases were the dismembered body parts of a fellow student , a @entity28 woman named @entity29 , whom @entity21 had shot three days prior and had spent the days since , eating various parts of her body			1
the details of @entity21 's brief incarceration and subsequent return to @entity20 are too vague and complex to state here , but for the sake of this introduction , i can say that on august 12 , 1986 , @entity21 checked himself out of @entity45 and has been a free man ever since			1
this is the point in the story in which things get really strange			2
in his 24 years of freedom since , @entity21 has experienced a level of notoriety ranging from perverse public intrigue to minor celebrity			1
he has published novels ; inspired songs ; been the subject of countless documentaries and magazine articles , and exploitation films in which he re-enacts his crime ; drawn manga novels and even directed his own personal pornography " experiment			1
" effectively , he has made a living off his crime			1
the prospect of not only meeting such a despicable man but spending several days with him was of course one of apprehension			2
a walk through his greater @entity73 apartment revealed an almost physical manifestation of his neurosis			2
just inside the door , a wall - mounted black balaclava hangs next to cabinets filled with gargoyle - like statuettes , classic literature and trinkets collected over decades of travels ( often with young girls he 's met under dubious circumstances )			0
chairs are piled high with stuffed children 's toys			0
his room is like a 14 - year - old boy 's : adorned with countless images of young girls , some painted by himself , some taken from celebrity magazines			1
see the rest of @entity21 's story at @entity9 after an initial meeting , we went to a local restaurant for lunch , over which @entity21 recommended we visit the national park around @entity104			1
" breathtaking scenery , " he assured us , " and there is a part of the forest where people go to commit suicide called @entity111			0
if i could drive , i would go there and kill myself , " he remarked casually			0
i explained that , funnily enough , we had been there a few days prior , shooting a documentary surrounding the park , and actually the train was modestly priced			0
we returned to his tiny apartment and began the interview			0
@entity21 stared into the lens of the camera and began his story			1
clearly , at times his delivery was scripted and straight from the pages of his novels			0
it was an abject despair at having to once again recount what he refers to as his " incident			0
" he was constantly desperate to somehow validate his existence , and what unfolded was a confession of a man approaching the end of a very unusual life and having spent too much time reflecting upon it			0
@entity21 's punishment , he believes , is the very thing that has supported him -- his fame and the irony is not lost on him			1
personally , i feel that this torment has not been punishment enough			0
furthermore , i feel that perhaps the blame is just as much upon us , the public			0
we have been encouraging this strange man to exist in order to feed our macabre fascinations , and the irony of that is not lost on me .			0
