-- @entity1 provided the perfect riposte to @entity4 president @entity3 after scoring a hat - trick as @entity6 beat @entity7 7 - 3 on a night when @entity8 grabbed his first goals at the @entity10			1
days after @entity3 had made a bizarre impersonation of the @entity13 while saying the star spent " a lot of money at the hairdressers " , the 28 - year - old scored his third career hat - trick against @entity7 to go top of the scoring charts in @entity21 with 11 goals			1
he celebrated his first goal from the penalty spot with a military salute in a mocking response to @entity3 's description of him as a " commander " last week			0
the absorbing victory also allowed real to put saturday 's defeat by @entity31 behind them , not just because of the three points but also because @entity8 , the most expensive footballer in history , began to repay some of his fee			2
making his first start as a home player at the legendary @entity10 , the @entity35 scored twice , made another two and also managed to complete his first 90 minutes in his seventh appearance for @entity6			2
despite @entity8 's largely anonymous display at @entity41 , which was blamed on a lack of match practice , @entity6 coach @entity39 was wholly vindicated by his decision to keep faith in the 24 - year - old , who curled home a fine opener before a free - kick was deflected in as he handed @entity6 a 2 - 0 lead			1
on a satisfying night for the hosts , for whom substitute @entity53 made his first appearance of the season after injury , @entity51 also grabbed a brace as @entity6 moved up to third in the table , six points behind @entity31			2
@entity7 were reduced to 10 men late on when @entity62 received his second yellow card			0
in @entity66 , both @entity64 and @entity65 closed the gap on @entity68 to just two points , but the league leaders can extend their lead -- and register a perfect 10 victories from their opening 10 league games -- when hosting bottom side @entity74 on thursday			1
goals from @entity77 and @entity78 helped @entity64 win 2 - 1 at @entity79 , with both sides reduced to 10 men late on , while @entity81 and @entity82 were among the goals as @entity65 thumped @entity84 4 - 0 at home			1
elsewhere , @entity87 @entity86 scored his first goal since returning for @entity89 as the seven - time @entity91 champions were held to a 1 - 1 draw by visitors @entity93			0
one of the most surprising results of the night came in @entity95 , where big spending @entity96 suffered their first defeat of the season at the hands of fellow @entity103 side reims in the @entity104			1
fielding a weakened side that was deprived of the suspended @entity106 , @entity96 were knocked out of the cup after suffering their first defeat since may -- as midfielder @entity110 fired home in the first half			2
@entity114 's side travel to @entity115 , who have not conceded a goal in six league games , at the weekend in a battle of the two sides immediately behind @entity121 at the top of the table			0
in @entity126 , @entity124 and @entity125 both progressed to the quarterfinals with respective victories over @entity129 and @entity130			0
@entity129 won 2 - 0 in extra-time thanks to goals from @entity133 and @entity134 , while @entity124 won through 8 - 7 on penalties after drawing 2 - 2 at home against @entity129			0
@entity124 ' win capped a miserable week in @entity138 for @entity140 's @entity139 , who missed the decisive penalty just days after being penalized for a harsh handball in @entity124 's 1 - 0 league win against the same opponents on saturday .			0

@entity1 hits a hat - trick and @entity8 a double as @entity6 beat @entity7 7 - 3
@entity64 and @entity65 close the gap on league leaders @entity68 in @entity66
@entity96 suffer first defeat of the season in @entity153
