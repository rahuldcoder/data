-- in a little - known corner of southern @entity3 , more than 130 men are wrapping up in their winter warmers and drinking down their last whiskeys , as they prepare to do battle with their fiercest foes on the fairways			0
their goal : a place in the fabled history of sporting rivalry between @entity13 and @entity15 universities			1
the " @entity17 " event takes place every january at @entity19 between alumni of the two famous academic institutions			1
competitors , whose ages can range from 18 to 85 , travel from such far - off places as the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 in a quest to attach their winning ball to the fabled president 's putter -- a hickory - shafted instrument dating back to the inaugural event of 1920			1
@entity36 flew in from @entity37 , @entity38 last week to see in the @entity39 with friends before heading down to @entity41 to take part in the event , which is scheduled to start on friday			2
he is just hoping the heavy snowfall forecast for the rest of the week will not cause the competition to be called off for only the second time in its history			1
" there 's a great tradition of the event going forward in spite of the weather , " says @entity36 , 31 , who studied history at @entity15			1
" last year , there was a hard frost and a very thick fog			0
there 's something lovely about the warmth in the clubhouse at the end of the day when it 's freezing cold outside			2
it really adds to the atmosphere of the whole thing			0
" while the competition is always intense -- many players have scratch or single - figure handicaps -- the matches are played in a jovial spirit and the motto of the event is " serious fun			1
" the winner 's medal carries the @entity78 inscription " @entity81 inter pares , " which is loosely translated by the @entity17 fraternity as " he was lucky to win			2
" the competition takes place over four days , with a dinner held on the eve of the sunday final , followed by a night out amid the cobbled streets of the medieval town of @entity41			0
" people push the boat out at both ends of the day , " says @entity90 , treasurer of the @entity13 and @entity91 , which organizes the event			1
" there are often a few whiskey macs and bloody marys on the first tee to bury the memories of the night before			0
" entry to the president 's putter is limited to golfing " @entity104 , " the term given to those who play for the @entity13 or @entity15 teams at sport			1
january is the chosen month because if falls at a time when students and graduates are generally on vacation			2
in its early years , the putter would be contested by some of the finest players of the day : four of @entity118 's 1926 @entity117 side were @entity120 graduates			2
the record for consecutive appearances is held by @entity124 army parachutist @entity123 , who played in 57 putters before finally hanging up his spikes in 2006 at the age 84			0
other well - known competitors include the former @entity130 cricket captain @entity129 , who won the event twice in the 1980s			1
while the snow flakes continue to fall on the frosty fairways of the course , braver competitors have been out practicing their games			0
others have been sharing stories in the warmth of the clubhouse bar as they wait to find out whether their annual pilgrimage has been worthwhile			0
" it would be a huge disappointment if it did n't happen , " says @entity36			0
" but we 'll make do with whatever the decision is and we 'll have fun whatever			0
