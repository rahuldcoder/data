-- glass screens that can feel the touch of your fingers are all the rage these days			1
you 'll find them in all kinds of gadgets , from smartphones to tablet computers			0
but the way a team of @entity14 sees it , there 's one huge problem with this technology : all glass screens feel exactly the same			2
so , ok , that " problem " may not be keeping you up at night			0
but think about the difference between typing on a hardware keyboard , where you can feel whether your fingers are hitting the right keys , and a touch screen keyboard , where the letters " q " and " w " feel exactly the same -- as does the space between them			1
that 's the problem that @entity31 is hoping to solve with a new technology it 's calling " @entity34			2
" this new type of touch screen , which was demonstrated for the first time at a tech conference in @entity39 this week , uses a small static force to control friction between a user 's finger and the touch screen			1
" it 's kind of like a buzzing or a vibration			0
it has the same effect as a buzz , " said @entity47 , one of the @entity14 researchers and a ph.d. student at @entity51			0
" but if you carefully tune the frequency and the vibration of the panel you can actually create things that feel like sandpaper or rubber or a wall			0
" in the case of a touch screen keyboard -- like those on the @entity68 , for example -- users would be able to feel the location of the keys , and could learn to " touch type " without looking at their hands , he said			1
when people clicked on a file to drag it into a folder , they would be able to feel the weight of the file and would know , through their sense of touch , that it had landed in the appropriate location , he said			2
larger files , like @entity87 movies , could also be made to seem heavier than small files , like text documents , @entity47 said			0
" a heavier document , like one that 's going to take longer to transfer , is going to feel heavier , " he said			0
unlike other attempts at touch - screen technology with " haptic feedback , " or impulses that stimulate the sense of touch , @entity91 has no moving parts			1
it uses small electrical impulses -- kind of like those involved in static cling -- to create a pull and push between a person 's fingertip and the gadget 's screen			1
here are some of the nerdy details : the touch screen is made up of three layers			1
a glass plate , topped with a transparent electrode and an insulator , is what people touch			2
to simulate friction and texture , the electrode creates small electrical fields in the insulation layer			1
these fields oscillate between positive and negative charges , creating those sensations			0
others have tried to use vibrations to make touch - sensitive screens feel more realistic			1
the @entity129 's screen , for example , compresses and clicks when users push on it successfully			2
but that does n't allow for users to touch different parts of the screen and receive different touch sensations , @entity47 said			1
that is possible with @entity34			0
the @entity31 technology , which has not been commercialized , has been incorporated into at least two prototypes			1
one mobile device was demonstrated this week at a conference held by the @entity143			0
another touch screen table is working at the @entity31 offices in @entity147 , @entity148 , he said			1
check out the project 's website for a video demo ( bonus features include mysterious hands petting cats , pinching cloth and fondling glassware )			0
if you 're feeling especially studious , the research team has posted an academic paper that explains more fully how the tech works			0
he said this technology is n't the " magic bullet " that will bring multitouch , tactile touch screens into the mainstream			2
but it may move them one step closer .			0

a new form of touch - screen technology *debuts* this week
@entity91 aims to let touch screen users feel different sensations on glass
the technology uses electrical impulses to simulate friction and texture
the @entity31 project has not been commercialized
