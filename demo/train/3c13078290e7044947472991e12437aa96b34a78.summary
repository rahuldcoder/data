-- one of the most valuable routes in the airline industry is the one that joins @entity5 to @entity6			2
it is the world 's busiest route , one particularly frequented by business travelers , and currently , it is dominated by @entity11			1
all that is set to change , thanks to a pivotal partnership between @entity15 and @entity16			1
last month , the two airlines unveiled a codeshare agreement across 108 routes , with @entity15 acquiring a 49 % share of the @entity22 carrier			1
for @entity15 , the deal provides access to a market that , though lucrative , has been difficult for them to crack			2
" @entity28 is the most important destination for the @entity31 business traveler , and we 've not been able to provide the global frequency that our customers need , " admits @entity27 , @entity15 's president			1
" @entity16 was the best way to get to them			2
" unlike @entity16 , which has experienced two years of steady financial losses , @entity15 has been in an upward expansion			1
it is the fastest - growing carrier in @entity5 -- abetted by a massive expansion of two of the city 's major hubs , including a $ 1.4 billion renovation of @entity44 at @entity45 , and $ 100 million upgrade of its facilities at @entity48			0
while @entity15 is gaining momentum in @entity50 , procuring slots at @entity28 has proved arduous for the airline , according to @entity53 , senior airline and aerospace analyst at @entity56			2

@entity15 has had a hard time getting in there , " he admits			0
" this deal really gives them a lot of access to @entity28 , which is an important market in @entity5			0
" currently , @entity15 has nine flights operating between @entity28 and the @entity31 when the partnership takes effect , that number will jump to 23			1
compared to @entity15 , @entity16 is a much more niche airline			1
it serves a smaller , predominately @entity22 clientele , providing them with a more upmarket experience			0
despite @entity16 's strong brand , its image does n't resonate as well outside the @entity22			1
ideally , the deal with @entity15 will introduce the carrier to a wider audience			0
" i think the spirit of our company will be very attractive to the @entity31 - based customers that @entity15 currently serves , " says @entity83 , ceo of @entity16			1
" i think that by becoming more successful and being able to generate more fans in the @entity90 , it 's going to spur even more innovation ( at @entity16 )			2
" as the two companies join houses , so to speak , experts are pondering which brand will be more prominent			0
" from a @entity16 perspective , i expect not much will change , at least not for a while " says @entity53			0
" @entity16 has a pretty strong brand across the @entity99 -- the better brand right now -- and @entity15 's going to want to leave that in place			1
" @entity104 which airport is the worst for delays asked if there 's a chance @entity16 might lose its identity in the process , @entity83 says he 's not worried			2
" the @entity16 brand and @entity16 style is one of the things that attracted @entity15 to us in the first place , " he says			1
" i think they 're looking forward to being able to offer their customers more choice			0
" for the deluge of passengers that fly @entity15 and @entity16 across the pond , the partnership could ideally result in cheaper fares			1
" i see them being able to give corporate customers much more options , and i see them really being able to kick off some extensive routes with above - average yields , " says @entity53 , who adds that in the airline industry , fuller planes usually results in cheaper tickets			2
" @entity6 and @entity5 are sort of dominated by the financial services business , which has taken it on the chin lately , " notes @entity53			0
" as a result , you have a consumer that is more price conscious and you need to find a way to get them a cheaper ticket while still making money			0
that 's why you need to get planes full			0
for @entity16 , this is the start of that process			0

@entity15 takes 49 % stake in @entity16
airlines hope that codeshare will increase their trans - @entity99 success
@entity22 - @entity31 routes are the most world 's busiest and lucrative
