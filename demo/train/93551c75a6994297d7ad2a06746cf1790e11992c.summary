the @entity12 - sphere exploded , with " @entity13 " and " # closingceremonies " trending worldwide , after @entity1 cut out performances by @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 in favor of a commercial - free airing of " @entity21			1
" " i still do n't understand , it 's a tape delay , so ca n't you do the math in advance ? why do you need to cut off the closing ceremony ? # nbcfail , " @entity27 wrote on @entity12			2
meet the man who started # @entity31 actor @entity32 posted to his @entity12 account : " why # nbcfail ranks last : no better way to turn people off a new show than to preempt @ thewho & other rock legends for it			0
" the network was under fire for much of the 16 days of the @entity6 by viewers who took to @entity12 and @entity44 to complain about its tape - delayed coverage of big - ticket events , which @entity1 has said was necessary to maximize its prime - time audience			1
earlier in the @entity6 , @entity1 came under fire for filing a complaint over tweets by @entity51 , the @entity52 - based journalist whose @entity12 account was temporarily suspended after he criticized @entity1 for its @entity55 coverage			1
in one tweet , @entity51 provided the company e-mail address of an @entity1 executive and urged followers to send him messages complaining about the tape - delayed coverage			1
@entity1 confirmed that it complained and @entity12 suspended him , saying it is a violation of the site 's terms of service to post personal information			2
it later withdrew the complaint			0
the network also came under fire for spoiling the results of @entity73 swimmer @entity72 's gold medal - winning race when it ran a " today " show promo that revealed the outcome of the race before it was telecast that night			2
the network relented in its opposition to streaming the closing ceremony live , though it offered an @entity81 pool feed rather than its edited program			0
@entity1 commentator @entity83 appeared to acknowledge the issue with the network 's tape - delayed coverage , saying during the broadcast that some of the challenges at the @entity6 would be eliminated at the @entity90 in 2016 because they will be held in a time zone only one hour ahead of @entity92			1
( the 2014 @entity55 , which will be televised in the @entity73 by @entity1 , are in @entity93 , @entity94 -- which is eight hours ahead of @entity92 , four hours ahead of @entity95			1
) live or later : what 's your ideal @entity55 coverage ? @entity1 did air @entity100 's performance at the closing ceremony in late night , following " @entity21			1
" but that did little to calm the fury of viewers , many of whom said they tuned in to see the @entity110 band @entity109 perform the official song of the @entity55			1
" their broadcast was horrible ! no muse with the official song of the @entity55			0
who made that call ? @ @entity1 # @entity118 , " @entity115 wrote on @entity12			0
@entity1 did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision to cut away from the ceremony , though it did appear to warn viewers that it was about to end its @entity125 coverage			2
