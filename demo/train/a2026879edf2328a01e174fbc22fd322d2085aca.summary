@entity0 -- @entity2 gets ready for snow long before any falls in @entity0 , which has n't seen a stormy winter for a few years now			1
it 's a crucial part of his job as manager of @entity9 , one of the busiest jumping off points for international flights and a hub for those traveling to and from the nation 's capital for official business			1
delays , especially those due to turbulent weather , cost airlines money and passengers lost time and productivity			2
that puts pressure on airport personnel and heightens the need to plan far ahead for turbulent weather			2
" if you were here earlier in the fall , you would see equipment running around and operating and acting as if there was 12 inches of snow on the runway , " @entity31 said			2
" it 's better to set the expectation early , make the call and then with high assurance know that when you get back to an operation status that you will be able to meet all the demands , " he said			0
snows delay flights his crews jumped into action for a surprise early march storm that moved from the @entity51 into parts of @entity53 and @entity54			1
as heavy snow blanketed parts of the area , the @entity9 plows moved swiftly up and down the long runways that handle jumbo jets and other big planes that need a lot of real estate to take off and land			1
airports like @entity9 keep more than 50 pieces of snow equipment handy for extreme winter weather			1
their small army of plows are constantly in motion during a storm , sweeping away snow and keeping accumulation at a manageable level			1
runways and other busy parts of the tarmac get priority			0
gate areas themselves are generally the responsibility of the airlines			0
@entity83 , the @entity9 operations manager , said certain areas sometimes can go without constant plowing			2
" we can have two or three inches of snow buildup here and still have safe taxiway			0
as long as we do n't have any physical obstructions , like a hill of snow for them to taxi through , this can sort of be left until a convenient time			0
on either side of the @entity0 storm , airport operations in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 took care of business as snowy weather blasted those cities			1
typically , airports remain open in snowstorms			0
it 's up to airlines to decide the status of flights			2
carriers lose millions of dollars every year to winter storms that affect their operations			0
recent federal regulations penalizing them for long ground delays and stricter attention to costs of managing their fleets now prompt carriers to cancel flights ahead of big storms			2
" seventy - two hours out we start really closely watching storms and how they will impact us , " said @entity124 , a spokeswoman for @entity125			0
" we really do everything we can to cancel everything we have to cancel 24 hours out , giving people a chance to make a decision about their travel plans before they get to the airport , " she said			0
for instance , @entity125 canceled more than 250 flights ahead of a storm that was expected to hit @entity98 on saturday			1
@entity139 pulled back another 125			0
@entity124 says that in the event of a snowstorm like the one that gave @entity31 's plows a workout , @entity125 will try to move as many planes as possible out of the area ahead of time so they are not sitting in the snow			1
this puts a premium on clearing runways efficiently			1
the faster that work is completed , the faster airlines can get back to flying once the skies clear .			0
