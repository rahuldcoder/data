@entity0 , @entity1 -- never send a live cable across a body of water			1
it 's just good common sense			2
but not for the local film crew i was working with in @entity1 's @entity0			1
to power the lights for an episode of @entity2 's " on @entity1 , " a locally hired grip tied a rope to the end of a cable			1
from the movie set bridge he was standing on , he called out to a colleague to catch it on the other side of a moat and begin pulling the charged cable across			0
fortunately , they were stopped before the count of three			0
movie - making in @entity1 is not for the timid -- something i learned both behind the scenes and while talking to some of @entity1 's leading movie - makers in @entity0 , home of the world 's largest outdoor film studio			1
gallery : where @entity1 's best films are made sprawling across some 2,500 acres with a full replica of the @entity35 , @entity0 is where @entity40 's " hero " was filmed as well as countless tv dramas for the @entity38 market			1
it 's also where grips like to take short cuts with cables , and makeup artists do touch - ups with dirty brushes			2
( i opted to do my own makeup for the shoot			0
) movie - making in @entity1 is a quick and dirty business , a process director @entity53 affectionately calls " @entity54			1
" her 2009 romantic comedy starring @entity56 , " @entity57 , " earned 100 million rmb ( $ 16 million ) at the box office , making her @entity1 's first female director to break that symbolic barrier			1
" the process in @entity62 is so slow , " @entity53 says			1
" the average project development time is four years			0
in @entity1 , if you have a good script , tomorrow you can get the money			2
" a few days later , the set is built			0
' " as a purveyor of @entity71 rom - coms , @entity53 has the benefit of speeding through @entity1 's censorship regime			1
that 's not the case for @entity76 , a director unafraid to challenge convention			1
his third film , " @entity78 , " was a commercial success but also received notice for its sympathetic portrayal of @entity84 soldiers during the @entity85			2
so how did he get it past the censors ? " i do n't know , " says @entity76			2
" you have to allow them to check your script			0
for the script , it took almost one year , and after you finish the movie and post-production , you have to show the videotape to the censors and ( it takes ) another half a year			0
" " it 's not the fault of a certain person , " @entity76 adds			1
" it 's a system			2
" working with @entity62 studio execs in @entity1 , producer @entity103 describes the censorship process as a moving target			1
as ceo of @entity108 , he 's responsible for bringing blockbuster @entity62 - @entity1 co-productions to the big screen including " @entity112 " and " @entity113			1
" " if you look at the films that are actually shown here , a lot of them do n't really follow the rules , " he says			0
@entity103 references a list published by the government that details what types of films can not be screened in @entity1			2
examples of prohibited movies include those that " disrupt social order , " " endanger social morality " or " promote cults and superstition			0
" " if you look at that list , basically you would not really be able to make anything , " says @entity103			0
" that 's very @entity71 in a sense , saying ' let me say what you ca n't do , and we 'll work our way backwards			2
' " take , for example " @entity112			0
" a strict interpretation of the list would have filmmakers shy away from a time travel movie in fear of " promoting cults and superstition			0
" but ultimately , the sci - fi thriller was filmed partly in @entity1 and became a major box office success in the country last year			1
" stars have rules , studios have rules , everybody has rules			0
you just forge ahead and if it 's something that 's really worthwhile , it will come out , " says @entity103			2
@entity53 is also pragmatic in her view of the process : " as filmmakers , we 're so used to getting everybody 's different input into the process , sometimes from investors , sometimes from producers , sometimes from the talent			1
we just have to deal with it and be smart about it			0
" but @entity76 is calling for change in the censorship system , hoping that @entity71 filmmakers can be governed less by guesswork and more by a transparent rating system			1
@entity76 says there must be change for the sake of his craft and also because his audience demands it			1
" in an @entity181 movie , you can blow up the @entity182			0
we can not blow up ( @entity184 ) @entity183			0
but the audience wants to see a lot of exciting visual things			0
so i think the leadership will think about that			0
" he 's asking for the freedom to film @entity1 's own " @entity194 , " the freedom to blow up anything without fear of political blowback			1
just try to get it on film if that gonzo grip is standing by .			0

this month 's episode of " @entity1 " *focuses* on country 's booming film **industry**
episode filmed in world 's largest outdoor film studio , @entity0
director @entity53 says **industry** operates on " @entity54 , " much faster than @entity62
@entity76 calls for change in the censorship system to a more transparent rating system
