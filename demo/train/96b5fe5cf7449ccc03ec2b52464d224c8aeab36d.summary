-- there is a new speaker in town			0
rep. @entity4 , @entity5 , will be the new speaker of the house , replacing rep. @entity7 , @entity8 , as the @entity9 rolled in tuesday 's midterm elections , gaining a majority for the first time in four years			1
the @entity9 will pick up more than 60 seats in the legislature , a statistical analysis of exit polls by @entity0 projects			1
that 's a comfortable margin over the 39 seats needed to wrest control from the @entity21			0
unrest over the economy and government spending , as well as the surge of @entity26 politics , helped propel the @entity9			1
tuesday 's outcome was comparable to the 1994 so - called " @entity28 , " when the @entity9 took 54 seats from the @entity21			1
it is also the largest number of @entity33 pickups since @entity21 picked up 75 seats in 1948			1
as of 2 a.m. et wednesday , the @entity9 held 231 seats to the @entity21 ' 169			1
at least 218 seats are needed for a majority			1
" it 's clear tonight who the winners really are , and that 's the @entity45 people , " @entity4 said tuesday night in front of a crowd chanting , " speaker ! speaker ! " the election was a repudiation of big government and politicians who refuse to listen to their constituents , he said			0
the message to president @entity52 was clear , @entity4 said : " change course			0
" under a @entity9 majority , " the people 's priorities will be our priorities , " an emotional @entity4 said			1

@entity4 's camp described the call as " brief but pleasant			0
" the @entity9 leader told @entity52 that he 's always been straightforward with him in the past , and will continue to be so			1
the ramifications of a @entity9 majority were tempered by the projection that the @entity68 will remain in @entity21 hands			1
with a @entity71 in the @entity33 and a @entity21 @entity68 , both parties will have to reach compromise or risk gridlock in the legislature			1
key @entity9 have already hinted that compromise is not a priority on their agenda , as many of them were swept into office precisely because of dissatisfaction with @entity52 's policies			2
the @entity9 made sizable inroads in @entity82 , where a trio of @entity21 incumbents were projected to lose , according to @entity0 analysis of exit poll data			1
@entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , of the state 's 5th , 9th and 2nd congressional districts , respectively , are projected to be out of office			0
@entity9 @entity94 won the 5th district , and @entity96 won the 9th district , @entity0 projected			1
@entity9 challenger @entity98 won in the @entity99			2
in @entity105 's @entity104 , @entity21 rep. @entity100 , a lightening rod for his confrontational and sometimes rude attitude toward his political opponents , lost his seat , @entity0 projected			2
@entity9 @entity107 , whom @entity100 chided as " @entity108 " in what many considered an unfair attack ad , will be the area 's new congressman			2
two other seats in @entity105 also switched hands in the @entity9 's favor			1
@entity21 rep. @entity115 was projected to lose to @entity9 candidate @entity116			2
in @entity105 's 24th district , @entity9 challenger @entity117 will take the place of rep. @entity120			2
with about 100 of the 435 @entity33 seats at stake considered " in play , " or competitive , an @entity124 mood was predicted to result in big @entity9 gains			1
in a statement early wednesday , @entity7 defended the work @entity21 have done in the @entity33			1
" over the last four years , the @entity129 in the @entity33 took courageous action on behalf of @entity45 's middle class to create jobs and save the country from the worst economic catastrophe since the @entity135 , " she said			2
she urged lawmakers to help move the nation forward			0
" we must all strive to find common ground to support the middle class , create jobs , reduce the deficit and move our nation forward			1
" in @entity144 , a moderate @entity71 , @entity143 , who has been a member of the @entity33 since 1991 , saw his time in @entity146 come to end			2
@entity9 @entity147 ousted @entity143 , who long had represented a conservative district by siding with @entity9 on some key votes , including voting against the health care bill			2
other moderate @entity21 were able to save their seats			0
rep. @entity152 , @entity154 - @entity153 , was among those in his party who campaigned by running away from it , distancing himself in a debate from @entity7			2
he kept his seat tuesday night , @entity0 projected			0
one moderate @entity9 was n't as lucky			0
@entity161 , a @entity9 from @entity163 's 2nd district , was the only @entity164 to vote in favor of the health care bill			0
on tuesday , his constituents elected @entity21 challenger @entity168			0
that @entity21 gain in the state was offset by the projected outcome in the 3rd district , where an open @entity21 seat went to @entity9 @entity174			1
heading into election day , the @entity21 had a 255 to 178 advantage in the house , not including two vacancies			0
republicans needed to win an additional 39 seats to claim the @entity33 majority			1
in addition to anti-democrat sentiments due to a slow economic recovery and what is seen as increased government spending , the advent of the @entity26 movement also played a role in these elections			0
the @entity26 has boosted little - known candidates to victory in primaries over mainstream figures across the country			0
how they fare in the general election will be seen tuesday			0
win or lose , the impact of this group is expected to shift the @entity9 agenda to the right			0
that means little chance of compromise or bipartisan approaches on major issues , observers say			0
already , @entity4 , has signaled he is not planning to negotiate with the @entity33 or congressional @entity21 on his party 's top issues			0
" this is not a time for compromise , and i can tell you that we will not compromise on our principles , " @entity4 said last week on @entity210 's program			0
recognizing that discontent with @entity21 comes from the economic situation and record deficit spending , a priority for the @entity9 will be to focus on fiscal issues			0
@entity33 @entity9 have promised to cut $ 100 billion from the federal budget in the first year , rolling back spending to 2008 levels			1
