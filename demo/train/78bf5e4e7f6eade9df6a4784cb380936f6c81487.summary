the @entity17 ( @entity18 ) this much - hyped 2.3 - kilometer - long linear park sits on a disused section of the @entity21 and connects @entity22 in the @entity22 with 34th street			1
" i love running the @entity17 for many reasons , " says @entity23 , a member of the @entity24			1
" it 's an amazing green space high above street level , so you 're not only getting the chance to be out in nature , but you 're taking in views of the @entity32 and the @entity33 , along with other skyscrapers			1
" there are several art installations , so it 's like running through an outdoor museum			1
" starting point : @entity22 @entity40 ( @entity41 ) the seven - kilometer @entity40 is a shiny strip of tarmac alongside the @entity44 that has a designated lane for runners			1
the route starts from the @entity48 , near the @entity50 metro station , and finishes near @entity52 highlights include the luxurious turreted apartment blocks near @entity44 and , on the final stretch , views of the arched @entity57			0

the @entity67 area is the greenest section			0
more advanced runners head to @entity70 and follow the signs for @entity72 and @entity73			2
this trail leads up the mountain , but the views from the top -- @entity62 's highest point -- make the effort worthwhile			2
" @entity61 is centrally located , making it easily accessible , " says @entity80 , president of the @entity81			0
" the unpaved roads are easy on the joints , although the slope at times can be challenging when you 're making your way up to the top of @entity61			0
" starting point : 1260 @entity91 @entity92 ( @entity93 ) the @entity92 has a total length of 50 kilometers but can be easily broken down into shorter stretches			0
" starting from the @entity99 , the first half is a gradual descent through dense tropical woodland , crossing occasional streams and offering brief glimpses of the city below , " explains @entity96 , a member of @entity93 's @entity97			1
" the second half includes steep exposed climbs over some of the island 's highest peaks , with 360 - degree views			2
the finish in @entity112 is the perfect place to relax			0
" those looking for something light can start with the easygoing section # 1 -- a seven - kilometer stretch that begins at the @entity99 and finishes at the @entity118			0
starting point : @entity99 @entity120 ( @entity121 ) with stunning views over downtown @entity121 , the 7.4 - kilometer @entity120 starts at the @entity124 's @entity123 in the city 's outskirts and finishes at the @entity127			1

" the beauty of the trail makes you forget that you 're in one of the largest metropolitan cities in the @entity141 , until you pause at the end of your run and see the sunset reflecting off the classic @entity121 skyline			0
" starting point : @entity147 , @entity124 @entity148 ( @entity149 , @entity150 ) the 20 - kilometer @entity148 is a linear park that starts at @entity152 in @entity149 and finishes in the city center			2
" i like that i can run 10 kilometers in one direction , then turn around and run 10 back , and the scenery changes constantly , " says @entity154 , founder of @entity155			0
" not just when i change locations along the @entity148 , but throughout the day as the sun comes out and it warms up			0
" there 's really nothing like watching the sunrise over the @entity163 or watching the city wake up from the @entity166 viewpoint			1
" starting point : @entity168 @entity170 jogging tour ( @entity170 ) running can be a great way to discover a city but if you do n't want to go it alone , @entity170 offers organized running tours			1

starting point : 400 @entity196 @entity197 ( @entity198 ) " @entity198 is a place with hundreds of running trails , from runs along the city 's harbor to longer challenging bush trails in the chains of bush land that dots @entity198 suburbs and outskirts , " says @entity199 , president of the @entity200			1
among these is the @entity212 , a trail in @entity198 's western suburbs that loops around the lovely @entity215			2
