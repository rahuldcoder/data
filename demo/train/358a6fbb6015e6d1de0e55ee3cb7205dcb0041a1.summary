-- a flag that was nearly destroyed in the terror attacks of september 11 , 2001 , was raised outside of the funeral service thursday for 9 - year - old @entity4 , who was born on that fateful day			1
the banner , which measures 20 feet high and 30 feet wide , was draped between the extended ladders of two fire trucks outside the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , forming an arch under which @entity4 's family passed as they arrived ahead of the 1 p.m. ( 3 p.m. et ) service			1
@entity14 and @entity15 , @entity4 's parents ; and her 11 - year - old brother , @entity18 , paused for a few moments to look up at the flag as it rippled against the clear blue sky			1
a few minutes later , more relatives emerged from the same black @entity25 limousine that brought her immediate family , also craning their necks to take in the huge banner			2
the young girl was killed saturday when a gunman fired on a crowd at a congresswoman 's meet - and - greet event in @entity9			2
five others also died , and 13 -- including rep. @entity35 , @entity10 -- were wounded			0
the flag topped a building near the @entity38 of the @entity39 in @entity40 , and was heavily damaged by falling debris when the tower crumbled after hijacked airliners crashed into it and its twin			1
many remember the images of the tattered banner , fluttering heroically above the debris and smoke in the days after the towers ' collapse			2
soon after , the shredded flag was removed and put in storage until 2008 , when a member of the @entity40 @entity56 recovered it and took it to @entity59 , @entity60			1
foundation volunteers were there to help residents of the small town complete some rebuilding projects more than a year after a strong tornado devastated the region			0
according to @entity69 , the founder and chairman of the foundation , it was a way to say " thank you " to some of the townspeople who had come to @entity40 in the aftermath of the terror attacks to help there			0
according to the group 's website , while foundation members worked to rebuild the town , residents began to repair what is now called the @entity83 by patching it with flags recovered from the tornado rubble			1
since then , the banner has traveled across the country , gathering flags from other disasters that are stitched on by survivors and other groups			1
it even includes part of a flag upon which a dying @entity97 was laid , the foundation said			2
@entity69 said the idea to display the flag at @entity4 's funeral came to him when he heard an interview with her mother , @entity102 , who spoke about how her daughter always looked for the positives that came out of the 9/11 attacks			1
" she would refer to her birthday as a holiday , " @entity69 quoted @entity15 as saying			0
" when i heard more about her sense of service and volunteerism and the community spirit , her love of government , we just realized we had to have this flag at @entity4 's funeral , " he told @entity0			1
@entity69 contacted the family 's pastor , who conveyed the offer , and the @entity120 accepted			2
" we both let out a gasp of emotion , because , you know , that meant a lot to us , " @entity4 's father , @entity121 , told @entity0			1
" and for them to extend that courtesy to our daughter ... again , it 's just another one of those things that will help for us			0
we feel like the country wo n't forget her			0
" @entity69 says the flag is really more of a symbol of 9/12 , instead of 9/11			0
it shows " what it looks like when @entity139 come together and help each other recover from tragedy and disaster , " he explained			0
" when you look at this beautiful flag , it shows what it 's like when you connect all these people			2
we had a father on december 7 in @entity149 , @entity150 , who stitched the flag in @entity153			0
he lost his son in @entity155 , " @entity69 said			0
he said newly naturalized citizens would help with the stitching on friday at the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160			0
" it 's about bringing people together and showing what 's possible out of a tragedy like this			0
" citing @entity4 's love of helping other people , @entity69 said " kids get it			1
" " they understand when people are in need , what can you do to help			0
after the funeral and as the community in @entity9 and the country starts to heal after this , we 're going to look back and say , what could we do , the simplest thing every day , to make @entity4 smile on us ? just to be kind to your neighbor , volunteer			1
" " in a bizarre way , this is a tremendous gift that @entity4 is giving to us , to show the country this flag , to ... let people in local communities nominate service heroes to place a stitch in this flag so we can heal it and make this flag whole again by the 10 - year anniversary " this september , @entity69 said			1
