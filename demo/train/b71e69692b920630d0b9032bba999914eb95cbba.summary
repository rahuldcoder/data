-- @entity2 's @entity1 made a splash last fall simply because it was well - built and inexpensive , and yet it did n't require a two - year contract with a wireless carrier			1
now , it 's even cheaper			0
the @entity1 4 now costs $ 200 for the 8 gb model and $ 250 for the 16 gb model -- a $ 100 price reduction from before			1
those prices are n't incredible if you 're used to buying your phones through major wireless carriers at subsidized prices , but compared to most unlocked phones , the @entity1 is cheap			2
and it 's a decent phone , running the latest version of @entity2 's @entity18 operating system			2
buying the phone unlocked means you can bring it to certain wireless carriers in the @entity22 and save a lot of money on service			0
for example , with @entity26 you can pay as little as $ 50 per month if you bring your own phone			0
or , you can get a sim card from @entity30 and pay $ 45 per month for service			0
an unlocked phone also allows you to travel overseas and take advantage of lower service prices from local carriers			0
the only major drawback to the @entity1 is that it does n't support @entity38 data speeds , which can sometimes rival the speeds of home internet service			2
most smartphones sold in the @entity22 now support @entity38 , so this is one area where the @entity1 seems seriously outdated			2
still , at $ 200 , the slower data speeds are more palatable , especially for new smartphone adopters that are willing to sacrifice performance for a lower monthly bill			1
rumor has it that a new @entity1 phone , dubbed the @entity51 5 , is coming soon			0
it 's unknown whether this phone will be as cheap as the @entity1 was when it launched last year			0
but with lower prices on the @entity1 , @entity2 seems to be girding itself for the arrival of a cheaper @entity56 , supposedly called the " @entity57			1
" like the @entity1 , @entity59 's phone could be aimed at customers who want an unlocked , off - contract handset without spending gobs of cash			1
i 'll be surprised if the @entity1 does n't stick around to do battle with @entity59 , even after the @entity66 comes into existence &copy 2012 @entity69 time is a registered trademark of @entity69 used with permission .			1

@entity2 knocks $ 100 off of its @entity1 smartphone
it now sells for as little as $ 200 and does n't require a wireless contract
the moves comes as @entity59 is rumored to be *planning* cheaper *iphone*
