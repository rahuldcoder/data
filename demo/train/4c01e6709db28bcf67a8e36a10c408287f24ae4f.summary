-- @entity3 owner @entity2 will wait until an @entity5 investigator meets with @entity6 before holding his own meeting , the team said tuesday			1
@entity2 had announced on monday that he would fly to an undisclosed location on wednesday to talk to the offensive lineman about why he left the @entity5 team last month			1
@entity6 's sudden departure two weeks ago ignited a controversy over locker room hazing , perceived bullying and racial slurs among professional football players			1
" we want to get to the bottom of it , " @entity2 told reporters in @entity18 on monday			1
" we want to get to hear what the real facts are			1
there 's been so much said and done to date that i do n't think anybody really knows what has happened , because nobody has really spoken with @entity6 directly			1
" the league and @entity31 , who was appointed to investigate the controversy , asked @entity2 and @entity3 ' president @entity29 to wait " until they have the opportunity to meet with him , " @entity29 said in a statement to @entity0 on tuesday			1
" out of deference to the process , we will cooperate with their request , " he said			0
" we look forward to meeting with @entity6 as soon as possible			1
" @entity6 , 24 , left the @entity3 last month because of " harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing , " his lawyer said			1
days later , the team suspended veteran lineman @entity46 , 30 , for conduct detrimental to the team			0
@entity46 said in an interview over the weekend that his vulgar text messages and voice mail to @entity6 were misunderstood because " people do n't know how @entity53 and i communicate to one another			1
" " the world has changed , with social media and everything today , but one thing that will not change , there will be no racial slurs or harassing or bullying in that workplace , in that locker room and outside the locker room , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 , a real estate developer , has exchanged his own text messages with @entity6 in recent days , he said			1
" i would like to hear from him , what had happened , why he felt that way , the whole origin , what we did or what we could have done to really prevent something like this from happening , " @entity2 said			1
" i want to hear the facts , " he said			1
" from the facts , i can then say ' hey , were we right ? were we wrong ? ' and what have you			2
you ca n't just deal with speculation , and i will not deal with speculation			0
" @entity46 acknowledged in an interview aired on " @entity84 " that he used racist and vulgar language in voice mails and text messages to @entity6 but said it was " coming from a place of love			1
" " no matter how bad and how vulgar it sounds , that 's how we communicate , " he told @entity92 reporter @entity91			2
" that 's how our friendship was			2
" " for instance , a week before this went down , @entity6 text me on my phone ' i will murder your whole f - ing family , ' " @entity46 told @entity91			1
" now , do i think @entity6 was going to murder my family ? not one bit			1
" while @entity6 has not spoken publicly since the controversy erupted , his attorney @entity104 broke the silence on his behalf with a prepared statement last week			1
@entity6 tried " to befriend ... teammates who subjected him to the abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment " -- something @entity104 called " a textbook reaction of victims of bullying			1
" the taunting did not stop , however , the lawyer said			0
he cited " a malicious physical attack on him by a teammate and daily vulgar comments , " and a threat of a group sexual assault against @entity6 's sister			1
" eventually , @entity6 made a difficult choice , " @entity104 said of @entity6 leaving the @entity3			1
" ... @entity6 looks forward to getting back to playing football			1
in the meantime , he will cooperate fully with the @entity5 investigation			2
" @entity2 said he called for the independent investigation by the @entity5 because he knew the objectivity of a team investigation could be questioned			1
" we need to look at ourselves , " @entity2 said			2
" we have to examine everything internally			0
i know that this is so appalling to me			0
" but @entity2 also said he wanted to avoid overreacting			2
he formed a committee to help guide the changes , including former @entity140 coach @entity139 and quarterback @entity141			1
" we all know that the football locker room is a different workplace than most of us are accustomed to , " @entity2 said			2
" basically , i do n't want to make any excuses			0
i want to know that our workplace going onward will be the best workplace that you can find in the @entity5			2
" @entity2 said he had " total confidence " in head coach @entity149			2
the only issue that @entity46 " sidestepped and would n't answer " in his @entity92 interview concerned the allegation that @entity18 coaches had ordered a " code red " instructing the veteran to " toughen up " the younger @entity6 , @entity91 said			2
@entity46 said " legal issues " prevented him from answering			0
" the face of bullying in @entity159 " " right , wrong or indifferent , because of all this , you 've become the face of bullying in @entity159 , " @entity91 told @entity46			2
" someone thinks of a bully , they think of @entity46			0
" " this is n't an issue about bullying , " @entity46 said			0
" this is an issue of my and @entity53 's relationship , where i 've taken stuff too far , and i did n't know it was hurting him			0
" a profanity - filled voice mail from @entity46 to @entity6 that has been made public was intended to shock him so " his buddy " would call him back , he said			2
" i understand why a lot of eyebrows get raised , " @entity46 said , " when people do n't know how @entity53 and i communicate to one another			0
" @entity46 : " i 'm not a racist " " when it 's on the screen it sounds like i 'm a racist pig , it sounds like i 'm a meathead , " he said			0
" it sounds like a lot of things it is not			0
and i wanted to clear the air just being saying that i 'm a good person			0
" he acknowledged using the n - word in his communications with @entity6 , who is african - american			2
" i 'm not a racist and to judge me by that one word is wrong , " @entity46 said			0
" it , in no way , shape or form , is ever acceptable for me to use that word , even if it 's friend to friend in a voice mail			0
" he said " it was a joke			0
" the word is " thrown around a lot " in @entity5 locker rooms and it 's " a word that i 've heard @entity53 use a lot , " he said			1
" there 's a lot of colorful words thrown around in the locker room that we do n't use in everyday life			0
" @entity6 was his " best friend " on the team , @entity46 said			2
" you can ask anybody in the @entity3 ' locker room , who had @entity222 's back the absolute most , and they 'll undoubtedly tell you me , " he said			1
@entity46 said he was " miffed " by " how i missed this and i never saw it coming			0
" @entity91 asked @entity46 what he would say to his former teammate today if he were in the room			0
" i think i would give him a big hug right now , because we 've been through so much and i 'd be like ' dude , what 's going on ? why did n't you come to me ? ' " he said			0
" if he were to say ' listen , you took it way too far , you hurt me			0
' you know , i would just apologize and explain to him exactly what i explained to you			0
and i would apologize to his family that they took it as malicious			0
but i never meant it that way			0
