-- over the past two days , president @entity1 has finally weighed in on the tragic shooting of @entity3 , as well as the wave of protests that emerged in its aftermath			1
in an official @entity10 statement on wednesday and a brief speech from @entity12 on thursday , the president played his usual role of " the uniter , " preaching calm and healing to the @entity17 public			2
i wish he 'd just said nothing			2
to be clear , i did n't have any unrealistic expectations for @entity1			1
i did n't expect him to pump a black fist in solidarity or scream " fight the power " from the makeshift press room			0
i did n't even need him to take a clear side on the issue			2
i did , however , expect him to tell the truth			0
instead , the president delivered a polite but ultimately dangerous message to the @entity17 public			0
noticeably absent from president @entity1 's remarks was the issue of race			1
despite @entity37 being 68 % black , @entity37 's police force is nearly all white			1
blacks in the town comprise 86 % of all vehicle stops and 85 % of all arrests			2
over the past week , black residents of the town have complained of racial harassment from law enforcement			0
that , combined with the trend of unarmed black men being the victims of extrajudicial killings , makes the racial implications of @entity3 's death quite strong			1
even if one were to believe that @entity3 's killing had nothing to do with race -- a @entity58 ve position at best -- the wave of protests and debates that emerged after it happened have been undeniably racial			1
by not mentioning this racial dimension , the president reinforced the immature notion that racism can be defeated simply by pretending it does n't exist			0
full coverage on @entity37 shooting rather than leading the nation into a new level of racial understanding and dialogue , the president took the safe path through the door of post-racial rhetoric			1
@entity1 has also placed the highest priority on remaining calm			1
while this may seem reasonable on its face , particularly against the backdrop of rioting and looting , his words failed to acknowledge the legitimacy of black anger			0
black people die violent deaths way out of proportion to their numbers , sometimes killed by rogue cops and even more often each other			0
why would we not be angry ? opinion : @entity1 needs to lead on racial profiling legislation but unlike black - on - black violence , which is tragic but typically punished through proper legal channels , killings of unarmed young people by law enforcement continue to happen with impunity			2
instead of acknowledging the legitimacy of black anger over this , the president simply told us to calm down and stop looting			0
in doing so , he joined the chorus of far too many politicians and civil rights leaders who understate and trivialize righteous anger in order to show the public that they have " the people " under control			0
perhaps most frustrating , however , was the president 's insistence on using the language of equivalence when describing the rioting			0
similar to his " @entity129 " speech on race back in in 2008 , where he ignored the legacy of white supremacy and placed the racial frustrations of white and black @entity17 on equal historical tiers , @entity1 chided both black rioters and @entity37 police with the same moral tone			1
the president ignored the fact that the militarized @entity37 police force were the antagonists of the unrest , in both shooting the unarmed @entity3 and then using excessive force during the protests			1
in doing so , he ( perhaps unwittingly ) supported the narrative in some quarters of well - intentioned police officers whose hands were forced by violent natives .			0

in @entity3 shooting , @entity1 preached calm . @entity148 would rather he 'd said nothing
he says @entity1 left out mention of race , a clear factor in police antagonism in @entity37
he says extrajudicial killings of blacks undeniable ; @entity1 comments left this out
hill : @entity1 chided protester , cops in same moral tone ; equivalence gave cops cover
