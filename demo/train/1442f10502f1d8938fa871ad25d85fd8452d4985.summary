@entity44 was our first child and the center of our universe and i am humbly begging for all to have my son 's memory and soul left in peace			1
" the @entity54 , which completed the autopsy sunday , declined to release any preliminary findings at the request of the @entity58 , which is conducting its own investigation , a coroner 's spokesman said monday			2
it could take six weeks for toxicology tests , which would show if drug use was involved , to be completed by the coroner 's lab , the spokesman said			2
