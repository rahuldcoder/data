@entity0 , @entity1 -- the journey to the @entity0 is n't enjoyable			1
hours are spent in a car covering hundreds of kilometers of flat , barren desert			2
if you 're not careful , you can easily fall prey to boredom and passenger 's fatigue			1
the first signs of the approaching oasis are red and white buttes rising from the sand that break the monotony of the landscape			1
entering @entity0 is like @entity18 opening her door to @entity20 two large saltwater lakes fed by fresh water springs dominate the oasis , surrounded by a forest of date and fruit trees			1
in photos : @entity0 three barren hills -- home to the @entity0 , the @entity30 and the old town -- loom above the sea of green foliage			1
donkey carts seem to outnumber cars on the road in this sleepy part of @entity1			1
the only place to stay and truly experience everything the oasis has to offer is at one of the eco lodges			1
getting over the initial impact of living without electricity will be uncomfortable , at first			1
at @entity0 , you 'll need to break the addiction of @entity47 , cellphones , and television			1
but eventually a primitive human instinct kicks in , and a new level of relaxation takes hold			2
watch : @entity1 wants tourists back we stayed at the @entity55 , which sits on the far west end of the oasis straddling @entity58 and the @entity59			1
do n't be fooled into thinking that just because there is n't any power you 'll have to slum it			2
the rooms are built in the traditional @entity0 fashion , but with all the amenities of a five - star hotel , including hot water			1
step outside your room and prepare for an adventure			2
with only three full days i was limited in what i could explore			0
but i especially enjoyed taking a dip in the pool fed by a natural spring			0
then , i floated on the lake that , to my surprise , is just like the @entity79			0
sturdy horses take travelers into the @entity59 to watch the sun rise above the oasis and later that day , sink behind large dunes of the @entity85			1
speaking of sand : if you 're interested in sandboarding , make sure to check the boards first			2
the sandboard i used had an exposed screw on the bottom , which acted like an anchor going down the slopes			2
our desert guide , @entity97 , was extremely knowledgeable and friendly			0
while out exploring the fossils , we discovered what @entity97 believes are fragments of a meteor			0
we could n't be sure , seeing neither of us are meteor experts or geologists			0
you can enjoy a @entity0 sand bath if you 're brave enough to make the journey in the middle of summer			1
the average temperature is 38 degrees @entity109 ( or 100 degrees @entity110 )			0
if you take the plunge , you are buried up to your neck in scorching sand , which allegedly helps with rheumatism , high cholesterol , and other ailments			2
for 10 to 15 minutes the moisture is pulled out of your body , after which they dig you up			0
apparently the stench remaining in the pit once someone leaves is pungent			0
if you 're looking for a bit of adventure without a guide , bicycles are available to rent so you can discover the back roads of the enormous oasis			2
while out discovering its nooks and crannies , you might want to stop off at @entity134			0
rumor has it , the @entity1 queen visited and swam there -- but historians dispute this claim			1
back at the hotel , the amazing staff is ready to serve			0
the meals alone are an event			0
every multi-course meal is presented at a different location on the lodge 's grounds			1
dinner is under a ceiling of shining stars and illuminated by candlelight			0
after spending five years in @entity1 and dining in most of @entity154 's restaurants , i can say , without a shadow of a doubt , they serve the best food in the country			1
if you 're lucky , the owner of the lodge , dr. @entity162 , will join you for dinner			2
he 's a truly enlightened man with incredible knowledge of not only @entity0 , but of @entity1 as a whole , and makes for great conversation			1
later in the evening , lanterns illuminate the pathways around the grounds , some of which lead to a roaring fire			0
in my opinion , sitting by the fire with a good drink is the best way to relax and rejuvenate after a long day			0
part of what makes this oasis so magical is the difficulty in traveling there			0
only dedicated , serious travelers make the journey -- not your run - of - the - mill beach bum			0
if you decide to hop in a car or bus and travel the grueling hours , i can guarantee you will not be disappointed .			0

@entity0 is one of @entity1 's most *isolated* *settlements*
experience a slower paced way of life without electricity at an eco lodge
discover the @entity59 , sandboard on huge dunes , or a take a @entity0 sand bath
