-- in the digital age , war is n't contained to the ground			0
the @entity5 government on sunday said it has been hit with more than 44 million cyberattacks since it began aerial strikes on @entity8 last week			1
@entity9 , the hacker collective , claimed responsibility for taking down some sites and leaking passwords because of what it calls @entity5 's " barbaric , brutal and despicable treatment " of @entity17			1
" the war is being fought on three fronts , " @entity18 , @entity5 's chief information officer , said on sunday in a press release			2
" the first is physical , the second is the world of social networks and the third is cyberattacks			2
" the attackers are attempting to harm the accessibility of @entity5 's government websites on an ongoing basis			1
when events like the current operation occur , this sector heats up and we see increased activity			0
therefore , at this time , defending the governmental computer systems is of invaluable importance			0
" @entity5 and the military wing of @entity39 have been criticized for using ready - to - share images on social media to spread spin about the conflict , which has claimed the lives of about 100 palestinians and three @entity5 since the back - and - forth violence began again wednesday			1
there is some dispute about the effectiveness of the cyberattacks			0
@entity5 says the attacks have largely been unsuccessful			1
" we are reaping the fruits on the investment in recent years in the development of computerized defense systems , but we have a lot of work in store for us , " @entity5 's finance minister , @entity52 , said in a written statement			2
@entity62 quotes him as saying only one website was down for 10 minutes			0
@entity64 : instagram users wage peace in @entity5 @entity9 , meanwhile , posted a list of more than 650 @entity5 - based websites it says it has taken down or defaced since last week			1
" they 've knocked down websites , deleted databases and have leaked e-mail addresses and passwords , " @entity69 wrote friday for the tech site @entity71			1
" it 's a whopping takedown			0
" a post on an @entity80 feed monday morning said another set of hackers had defaced the @entity5 versions of several @entity85 websites , including @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			1
visitors to @entity86 's @entity5 site on monday morning saw an anti-israel rant instead of a search - engine homepage			2
" @entity85 is aware of the site defacements and working to get all sites fully functional , " a company spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" at present , we have seen no evidence to suggest the compromise of customer information but will take action to help protect customers as necessary			0
" a page associated with @entity9 also posted a new threat : " november 2012 will be a month to remember for the ( @entity105 ) and internet security forces			1
@entity5 gov. this is / will turn into a cyberwar			2
" some observers took this as a sign of an escalating digital battle			0
" beyond mere ' denial of service ' tactics that blocked sites with floods of junk data , the hackers also ramped up their attacks to penetrations of any vulnerable target available to them , resulting in tens of thousands of @entity5 citizens ' and supporters ' private data dumped onto the @entity129 , " wrote @entity114 from @entity115			1
others said most of @entity9 ' threats have been " hollow " so far			2
" today , @entity133 lacks the talent and semi-cohesion it once boasted across the net , and its most recent online crusade is an embarrassing reminder , " @entity132 wrote for @entity71 on monday			0
" this is less a war than the hacker equivalent of egging someone 's house and then smoking weed behind a @entity143			0
" the group is calling its campaign # @entity146			0
" while the @entity5 government almost certainly has backups of the aformentioned databases , these attacks as well as the defacements show @entity9 is n't just doing its usual spree of overloading target sites , " writes another tech blog , @entity148			1
" @entity146 appears to have gotten multiple hackers involved who are interested in doing actual damage , or at least something that is slightly more permanent than just a 404 , " which is the code that appears online when a website wo n't load			0
@entity114 , from @entity115 , makes the important point that none of this digital damage compares to the loss of life on the ground in the @entity168			0
" @entity9 ' attacks , of course , hardly register compared with the physical damage inflicted by both sides in the @entity8 conflict , " he wrote			1
