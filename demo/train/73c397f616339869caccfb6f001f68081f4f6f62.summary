@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 and the @entity3 may soon reach a deal over night raids by @entity3 and @entity1 special forces on local dwellings that would increase @entity1 control over and participation in the controversial operations			1
night raids are deeply unpopular among @entity1 , but @entity3 officials say they are vital to @entity14 's operation against insurgents			1
one @entity1 official stressed the deal would mean night raids complied with @entity1 laws			1
a @entity3 official insisted any compromise would not impede @entity14 's effectiveness			2
" there has been some very good progress , " president @entity23 's spokesman @entity22 said			0
" both sides are very close to agreement on a memorandum of understanding under which all night operations will be fully afghanized and conducted under @entity1 laws			1
" @entity32 spokesman @entity31 said , " we believe we are still making progress toward a resolution on the agreement			1
" but , he said , there 's no specific timing on resolving the issue			0
another @entity3 official declined to comment " on the specifics of ongoing negotiations			2
" " a memorandum of understanding will be in accordance with the ongoing process of @entity1 of special operations as required by the november loya jirga and will meet @entity3 operational needs , " the official said			1
a loya jirga is a national assembly of tribal elders			0
talks have been going on for weeks now on this key memorandum of understanding to address what is perhaps the most difficult issue in the partnership between @entity0 and @entity59			2
the agreement would remove one of the obstacles in the way of a highly symbolic @entity64 , outlining the basis for @entity3 - @entity1 cooperation for the years after @entity14 's 2014 drawdown			1
night raids also present a particular challenge to @entity23			2
their strong unpopularity has forced the president to demand they stop , or at least no longer involve foreign troops , despite their operational significance to @entity14			0
gen. @entity76 , who commands @entity3 and @entity14 troops in @entity1 , last month told @entity78 how vital and frequent those raids are			1
@entity76 said that in 2011 , 83 % of the raids succeeded in detaining or striking either their primary target or an associated insurgent			2
" this last year , we had about 2,200 night operations , " he told the @entity84			0
" of those 2,200 or so night operations , on 90 % of them we did n't fire a shot			0
on more than 50 % of them we got the targeted individual , and ( in ) 30 % more we got the next associate of that individual as well			0
" as for civilian casualties , in the 10 % of the night raids where shots were fired , " less than 1.5 % civilian casualties " resulted , @entity76 said			1
@entity32 spokesman @entity31 told reporters wednesday that over 97 % of the night raids are combined @entity3 - @entity1 operations , and almost 40 % of the night raids are now @entity1 - led			1
a senior @entity1 official said details of the arrangement on night raids were changing daily and meetings were ongoing , but the issue of compliance under @entity1 law was key to the talks			1
a legal process , such as the issuing of a warrant of arrest , would have to take place before any raids happened , the official said			0
it would not be enough -- as suggested in some reports -- if the legal process just involved asking a judge after the raid for permission to keep any detainees captured in custody , the official said			0
@entity23 says @entity1 's homes and villages need to be safe and protected			0
" what we are asking for , in very specific and clear terms , ( is that ) no foreign forces should enter @entity1 homes , " he said last year			0
secretary of defense @entity131 said last month that while it 's important that such operations continue , the @entity3 is making changes			0
@entity76 said last month that " we have come a very long way in creating greater capacity among the @entity1 to conduct night operations in a very credible way			1
" " now , we 're still heavily partnered with them , and we will be for some period of time , but ... all of our night operations are partnered with @entity1 partner unit forces			2
" @entity2 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			0

shots are fired in only one in 10 of the night raids carried out , gen. @entity76 has said
@entity32 reports " progress " toward a deal with @entity1 on the raids
@entity3 officials say the practice is vital , but night raids are deeply unpopular among @entity1
talks on an agreement have been going on for weeks
