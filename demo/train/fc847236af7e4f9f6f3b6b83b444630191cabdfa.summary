@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's @entity3 , or " the fat one , " annual @entity5 lottery paid a hefty $ 3 billion in prize money on wednesday to thousands of people testing their luck in @entity1 's deep economic crisis			1
the top single prize was about $ 4 million , and many of the winning tickets in that series were sold in @entity15 and the nearby town of @entity17 in the northeastern region of @entity19 , where the big prizes have often landed over the years			2
despite a widespread sense that money is n't flowing and bank loans are hard to get in @entity1 's financial crisis -- with nearly 20 % unemployment and a deep deficit that has prompted government austerity measures -- @entity1 and others from abroad " invested " about $ 4.3 billion into the @entity5 lottery this year			1
seventy percent was paid out as prizes , or $ 3 billion , while the remainder went for lottery adminstration and the national treasury , according to the national lottery website			1
the winning number was 79.250			0
most @entity1 buy just a one - tenth portion of a numbered series , and for wednesday 's top prize , it meant someone could have paid about $ 25 for a tenth portion and won $ 400,000 in return			1
that 's why champagne , or the @entity1 bubbly called cava , flowed at lottery offices , restaurants , and stores which had sold the winning numbers , often to @entity1 families , or a group of co-workers			1
@entity1 on average spent about $ 80 for lottery tickets			1
despite the economic downturn that was almost as much as last year			0
@entity1 news reports said a bar owner in the town of @entity58 , near @entity15 , had purchased a large number of what turned out to be winning tickets , and in turn sold them to his customers			0
some $ 235 million in prize money was to be distributed among them			0
other winners included a group of truck drivers from southern @entity1 who had purchased some of the winning tickets at a lottery office in central @entity15 , @entity1 media reported			2
the lottery started in 1763 , or 247 years ago			0
it has become such a deep tradition in @entity1 that even people who do n't buy lottery tickets usually end up with some tiny fraction tickets given away by their local butcher shop or pharmacy			2
the three - hour lottery draw was nationally televised and followed closely on radio and the internet , with @entity1 continually checking their ticket numbers			2
numerous smaller prizes , such as $ 60,000 for a series , were also awarded			0
the lottery draw was held at a convention center in central @entity0 this year , moving from its previous location at a school for the first time in 47 years , because officials said , more space was needed due to increased interest .			0
