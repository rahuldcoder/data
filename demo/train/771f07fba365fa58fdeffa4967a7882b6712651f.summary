-- more than 20 % of patients who received an implantable cardioverter - defibrillator -- a high - tech device that produces electrical impulses to regulate heartbeats and prevent life - threatening arrhythmias -- in recent years were not good candidates to receive the device , a new study suggests			1
researchers at @entity11 looked at more than 111,000 patients who received @entity14 implants between 2006 and 2009			1
more than 25,000 of those patients did not meet evidence - based criteria for receiving the device , according to the study			1
the risk of dying in the hospital was significantly higher for patients who received the @entity14 but did not meet the criteria , and 1 out of 121 patients in this category experienced complications following the implant , the study found			1
according to dr. @entity29 , lead researcher of the study published tuesday in the @entity31 , @entity28 often are recommended as a primary prevention tactic for patients who are at high risk for a cardiac arrest or life - threatening arrhythmia , but who have not yet suffered from these symptoms			1
however , the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , an agency of the @entity42 @entity41 , has issued a " decision memo " stating that only people having certain serious heart conditions or cardiac histories are suitable candidates for @entity28			2
the memo further states that patients must meet numerous other qualifications relating to clinical trials and not have certain serious diseases or conditions that would lower the implant 's efficacy or the patient 's likelihood of long - term survival			2
dr. @entity58 , president of the @entity59 , said in a statement that the @entity11 findings will have " major implications			1
" " the study indicates that there are substantial variations among hospital @entity14 implantation strategies , " @entity58 said			2
" this variation clearly demonstrates an opportunity for improvement in care			0
" dr. @entity71 , chairman of @entity72 and @entity73 at @entity74 , said the data should act as a " wake - up call " for physicians , surgeons and patients			0
" doctors are well - intentioned , but not all doctors should be determining the use of what is a very sophisticated therapy , " @entity71 says			0
he says that in this case electophysiologists should be making the final determination if the patient needs the device			0
even with the current guidelines , @entity90 said , some patients may fall into a gray zone and that each physician needs to use clinical judgment to make recommendations			2
" deviating from the guideline are acceptable in various circumstances , " she said			0
" but 20 % is a significant amount of deviation			1
" @entity90 found that many patients who were being implanted with the @entity28 had recently experienced arrhythmias or cardiac arrests			0
she said the time factor might explain the study 's finding of an increase in deaths among implant patients who did not meet @entity39 criteria			1
" these patients were sicker to begin with			0
they were in a period where they were more prone to complications , " @entity90 said			0
" the physicians have n't had the time to optimize the patients ' medical therapy before subjecting them to this surgery			0
" another possible explanation for the higher incidence of death might have been be whether the cardiologists who performed the implant were electrophysiologists			1
these specialists have additional training in the diagnosis and treatment of abnormal heart rhythms and were less likely to implant an @entity14 in a patient who did not meet evidence - based criteria , the study found .			0

a *federal* health agency has a set of guidelines for *evaluating* implant candidates
@entity11 study : more than 20 % of implant *recipients* were n't good candidates
among those patients , the risk of dying in the hospital was significantly higher
findings will have " major implications , " the president of a cardiologists ' group says
