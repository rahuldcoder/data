@entity0 -- the attack on @entity4 students in @entity5 , a small town in the @entity7 - west of @entity8 , allegedly by a group of @entity8 youngsters , followed by the largest international wine fair , @entity12 , in @entity13 , where @entity4 investors were very much present -- and active -- have triggered much talk in @entity8 about @entity4 investment in the country 's vineyards and a backlash against it			1
over the past couple of years , there has been a significant rise of @entity4 investment in @entity8 wines , notably @entity13 wines			1
in line with this , @entity4 has recently become the first export market for @entity13 wines			1
but @entity4 investors seem to want more than being simple buyers			1
many want wines to match their tastes and those of their fellow citizens			1
that 's why they have started to invest in the well - known @entity37 brands , wine domains or wine trading companies			1
whether they are buying the entire vineyard or only part of it , @entity4 investors want to hold greater control over the final product			2
" there are two groups of @entity4 buyers , " says @entity45 , an estate agent in @entity13			2
one is typically from @entity49 where the people look " for something smaller , something that is more for the passion of wine			0
and , although they are commercially minded , they are more interested in the wine product itself			0
" @entity45 , co-founder of @entity58 ( affiliate of @entity60 ) , talks a bit differently about the mainland @entity4 who " will be thinking about all aspects of using the resource to make some maximized returns			2
" @entity67 fits almost perfectly in @entity69 's first description			0
this businessman from @entity49 bought the @entity71 in 1997 , in the @entity13 village of @entity73			0
he has since then " invested more and more to increase the quality and the size of the vineyard , " says @entity74 , in charge of wine marketing for @entity67			0
" he comes three to five times a year , " adds @entity74 , who describes @entity67 as having a real passion for @entity8 wine			2
indeed @entity67 is not just a distant vineyard owner : his love for wine has become a family matter and his children are now very much involved in the business			0
so does this trend really come as a big surprise ? @entity8 wine has always appealed to foreigners			2
the @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , etc. have been buying @entity8 vineyards for decades , if not centuries			1
surely the fact that the @entity4 are also starting to invest in these same lands should be a reflection of the global era , nothing more than that			1
for @entity107 - @entity106 , whose wine trading company @entity13 was the subject of a 70 % investment purchase by @entity110 and wine , a subsidiary of @entity113 , a state - owned food group , the @entity4 are looking for a sense of " recognition " , one which he describes as " social			1
" " they are attracted to a @entity121 lifestyle , they are of course looking for expensive stuff and wine is part of that lifestyle " , he adds			0
undoubtedly , the @entity4 seek to invest in @entity8 vineyards for the reputation of the wines and their quality			1
in a way , owning @entity8 vineyards gives them credibility			1
there are even investors who seem to specifically target the @entity37 brands which sound very @entity8 such as the " @entity135 " or the " @entity139 " names that are recognizable symbols of @entity8 culture			2
and the @entity8 appear receptive to @entity4 investment in their wine , particularly in the @entity13 region			1
@entity106 is himself enthusiastic about the @entity4 coming to @entity13 , " they come here to learn , they come here to understand and when they bought some chateaux ; they were rather positive in improving the quality			2
" the businessman also likes to wittingly remind people that " in @entity13 , we welcome them much better than ( if ) they are in @entity148			0
" in fact , he has a point			0
when @entity152 was sold to a @entity4 investor , the winegrowers of @entity148 were not impressed by the transaction and the manner in which it was handled			2
the head of the wine syndicate of @entity152 , @entity107 - @entity158 , expressed his disappointment saying that he and his winegrower colleagues were " really sad to see that the only chateau of the 12th century -- with the @entity162 - will be acquired by a person foreign to the job			0
" @entity165 , who 's been in the wine business for more than 30 years , explains that the purchase of this chateau may cause future and significant financial difficulties for the remaining winegrowers of the region			0
as the @entity4 investor outbid local vintners to pay eight million euros -- more than double the estimated value of the property -- this will change the market prices for vineyards and , as @entity158 indicates , taxes on succession rights to these properties will also rise significantly			1
but the selling of @entity183 has also caused discontent among local growers because of the nature of the region itself			1
@entity148 is a lot smaller in comparison to the @entity187			0
so any purchase of a significant vineyard in @entity148 has a much greater impact on the region			0
domains are very often a family affair ; " each winegrower is also a winemaker , " says @entity158 with a wholehearted voice			0
" what would the @entity4 say if @entity121 started buying 10 or 20 meters of the @entity202 ? " asks the @entity199 , semi-smiling , semi-serious			0
but ultimately @entity8 wine inspires admiration among the @entity4 , and the @entity8 have something to gain out of this			1
plus , the @entity4 are not " buying everything " ; in @entity13 , where they invest the most , they have only acquired 1 % of the whole wine lands			1
it 's not exactly a huge loss .			0

@entity4 investment flowing into @entity8 's vineyards , sparking backlash
many @entity4 want wines to match their tastes and those of their fellow citizens
@entity4 seek to invest in @entity8 vineyards for the reputation
*selloffs* have also caused discontent among local growers
