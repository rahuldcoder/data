@entity0 -- a massage therapist who accused @entity3 of sexually assaulting him at the @entity4 hired high - profile attorney @entity5 to represent him a day after he withdrew from a lawsuit filed by another lawyer			1
" we are in the process of conferring with him regarding the next steps , which he may wish to take , " @entity5 said			2
the original federal suit against @entity3 is still pending , but it involves just one male therapist who says the actor groped him during a massage at an @entity18 hotel			1
attorney @entity19 , who filed the lawsuit last week , dropped @entity21 # 1 , who made the @entity4 allegation , from the complaint tuesday because of the @entity27 man 's confusion over the date of the alleged incident			1
@entity3 lawyer @entity30 called the charges from both men " ridiculous " and said the dismissal of @entity21 # 1 " completely vindicated " the actor on that allegation			1
" we fully expect that my client will similarly be vindicated with respect to @entity21 # 2 , as well as with respect to any other person who makes meritless claims against @entity3 , " @entity30 said			1
that dismissal was " without prejudice , which means that he is still legally entitled to file a lawsuit against @entity3 if he chooses , " @entity5 said wednesday			1
@entity19 apologized last friday for putting the wrong date of the @entity21 # 1 incident in the lawsuit , saying his first client initially told him it was january 16 , 2012			1
@entity30 produced a restaurant receipt and a time - stamped photograph that showed the actor was in @entity54 , not @entity0 , on that date			0
instead of just changing the date on the filing to january 15 -- the day @entity21 # 1 later decided was when it happened -- @entity19 decided to withdraw the allegation from the lawsuit			1
otherwise , it would have hampered the chances of @entity21 # 2 's case , he said			2
@entity19 also said he had " personality conflicts " with @entity21 # 1 that contributed to his decision			1
the lawyer insisted in a @entity1 interview tuesday that he would " mop up " in the courtroom with the allegations made by @entity21 # 2			2
" i can guarantee that @entity21 # 2 has a truckload of witnesses to back up what he 's saying , " he said			2
his case is also bolstered by a series of e-mails in which the @entity18 plaintiff complains to his supervisor about @entity3 's advances , @entity19 said			1
@entity30 attacked one e-mail published in some online reports that purportedly supports the @entity21 # 2 claims			0
" various media outlets are reporting on an e-mail that @entity21 # 2 allegedly sent to his bosses , which significantly does not refer to my client at all , nor does it make any mention whatsoever of any of the things outrageously alleged in @entity21 # 2 's lawsuit , " @entity30 said			2
" instead , @entity21 # 2 voiced complaints about his co-workers gossiping and being insubordinate			0
" the e-mail 's lack of @entity3 's name " says it all , " @entity30 said			0
" nothing that is alleged in @entity21 # 2 's lawsuit was mentioned in the e-mail he sent to his bosses , making his claims even more unbelievable			2
" " the allegations in ' doe # 2 's ' lawsuit are unraveling , just like ' @entity21 # 1 's ' ridiculous allegations , which were proven false and impossible , " he said			1
" i think i can show a custom , habit and practice , " @entity19 said , referring to his allegation that the actor has sexually assaulted dozens of other massage therapists over the years			0
" if i bring in 100 people that do n't have an ax to grind , do n't want any money , they 're in 50 different states , they do n't know each other , they 're all massage therapists , they all have dates , they 're at different spa resorts and they say this exact same thing happened , it 's pretty hard to refute , " @entity19 said			0
his client " ai n't going nowhere , " and is looking forward to a trial , he said			0
" he means business , and he is absolutely determined and he 's as solid as they come as when it comes to character , history , reputation , " @entity19 said			0
" he 's everything you would want in a client			0
" the second plaintiff was a staff massage therapist at the @entity18 hotel where he claims he was assaulted by @entity3 on january 25 , the amended lawsuit said			1
@entity3 , 58 , has been married to actress @entity142 for 20 years			0
the oldest of their three children , @entity146 , was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the @entity149 in january 2009			0
@entity1 's @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
