@entity0 , @entity1 -- seven @entity4 presidential contenders faced off monday in one of the first debates of the primary season , offering policy ideas and criticism of president @entity10 to try to separate themselves from the competition almost 17 months before the 2012 election			1
with @entity10 intent on re-election , @entity4 viewers were paying particularly close attention to try to determine which candidates can defeat an incumbent who won in 2008 with strong support from independent , minority and young voters			1
some of the contenders made news in the debate , with conservative rep. @entity25 of @entity26 announcing she filed her papers monday and would soon declare her formal candidacy for president			1
" we 're going to win , " @entity25 said of @entity4 chances in the 2012 vote , drawing applause from the @entity4 audience at @entity35 's @entity34			1
" make no mistake about it			0
president @entity10 is a one - term president			1
" dressed in dark suits , the candidates offered brief introductions in lieu of opening statements that emphasized their experience and values			2
the tone remained direct but cordial throughout the two - hour debate , with candidates focusing their strongest criticism for @entity10			1
former @entity52 gov. @entity51 , the early front - runner in polls after his unsuccessful bid for the @entity4 nomination in 2008 , maintained a steady drumbeat of criticism of @entity10 , saying the president 's policies have failed and the administration erroneously thinks it knows what is best for the economy			1
" he 's failed the @entity65 people both on job creation and the scale of government , and that 's why he 's not going to be re-elected , " @entity51 said , while @entity25 said @entity10 's economic report card " right now has a big failing grade on it			1
" @entity25 also lambasted @entity10 's @entity75 policy , calling it " substantially flawed " and noting the @entity65 still is uncertain about whether @entity77 figures are part of the @entity75 opposition trying to oust @entity80			1
former @entity82 sen. @entity81 said @entity10 had " turned his back on @entity65 allies and he has embraced our enemies , " while @entity88 rep. @entity87 called for an end to drone strikes in @entity91 and @entity92 , saying " our national security is not enhanced by our presence over there			1
" in the end , all praised each other , with @entity51 declaring that any of the seven on stage would be a better president than @entity10			1
but @entity101 , an unemployed realtor and computer teacher from @entity104 , @entity105 , took issue with that notion			0
" i think that we , the @entity65 people , should be upset that these seven candidates have all of the answers and , if they were president ... the county would be in a better place , " according to @entity116 , who said she typically votes @entity118			1
a @entity120 survey released monday showed @entity51 grabbing the support of 24 % of @entity4 and independents who lean toward the @entity4			2
former @entity124 gov. @entity123 came in second at 20 % , followed by former @entity127 mayor @entity126 and the rest of the field			0
@entity123 and @entity126 , who have not announced that they will join the race , did not participate in monday 's @entity2 / @entity134 / @entity133 debate			2
participants were declared presidential candidates @entity51 , businessman - turned - talk show host @entity136 , former house speaker @entity138 , former @entity26 gov. @entity139 , @entity87 , @entity81 and @entity25			1
the debate included questions from journalists , audience members and voters at gatherings across the state , which will hold the first presidential primary next year			2
@entity51 is the heavy early favorite in @entity1 due to his time as governor in neighboring @entity52			2
moderated by @entity2 's @entity154 , the debate covered major domestic and foreign policy issues including economic policy , deficit reduction and the wars in @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity75			2
answers illuminated key differences between the candidates			2
for example , when asked about a controversial @entity4 proposal to overhaul the government - run @entity167 health insurance program for senior citizens , @entity164 cautioned against an extreme step akin to the @entity118 health care reform law unanimously opposed by @entity4 legislators			2
he made similar comments when he kicked off his campaign last month and had to backtrack then under heavy @entity4 criticism , and on monday night he moderated his stance by supporting the overall proposal with some modifications			0
the other candidates generally backed a major structural reform of @entity167			0
@entity164 , @entity139 and @entity136 all drew applause by declaring their support for right - to - work legislation passed in some states that halts required union membership , and @entity139 defended his economic plan introduced this week that was based on 5 % annual growth , which has rarely been achieved in modern @entity65 history			0
" this idea that we ca n't have 5 % growth in @entity65 is hogwash , " @entity139 said			0
" it 's a defeatist attitude			0
if @entity195 can have 5 % growth and @entity197 can have 5 % growth , then the @entity65 can have 5 % growth			0
and i do n't accept this notion that we 're going to be average or anemic			0
so my proposal has a 5 % growth target			0
" as the current favorite , @entity51 faced criticism from his fellow candidates			1
@entity81 , an ardent foe of abortion , said it was important to look at a candidate 's record when asked about @entity51 's policy switch from a pro-choice stance as @entity52 governor to a pro-life stance in the 2008 campaign and today			1
voters looking at candidates should consider " the authenticity of that candidate " and look at the record over time to see " what they 've been willing to fight for , " @entity81 said , touting his own pro-life credentials			1
@entity51 responded by saying that he believed " people understand that i 'm firmly pro-life , " adding he would support @entity229 justices who follow the @entity231 rather than " legislate from the bench " and that he believed in the sanctity of life from beginning to end			1
@entity139 , meanwhile , avoided an opportunity to repeat his criticism of health care reform in which he tied @entity10 's health care law to @entity51 's health care legislation in @entity52 , coining a word : " @entity241			1
" when pressed on monday , @entity139 declined to repeat the phrase with @entity51 standing nearby			2
while @entity51 was a focus of attention at the debate , @entity164 had the most to prove after last week 's exodus of 16 top aides from his campaign less than a month after he formally announced his 2012 bid			1
the outgoing staff cited the candidate 's questionable work ethic and fundraising ability as their reason for abandoning the campaign			0
@entity164 has vowed to continue and sought monday to use his strong skills as a debater to demonstrate that his candidacy is still viable			0
when asked about immigration reform , @entity164 angrily rejected the narrow definition of the question , saying candidates should avoid giving a yes or no answer on such a complex issue			0
also in the field monday was @entity87 , who tried to appeal to a national audience in his third presidential bid			0
@entity87 has devoted and energetic followers , but he is thought to be somewhat out of the mainstream of @entity4 politics thanks to his calls to scale back @entity65 military efforts abroad and his attempts to get rid of the @entity276			0
but in the aftermath of the 2010 midterm elections , which saw @entity4 make gains up and down the ballot after running campaigns built on scaling back the size of government , @entity87 insists that @entity4 are moving toward his proposals			0
@entity81 , @entity25 and @entity136 are all well - known in social conservative circles and now are vying for the support of that key voting bloc			1
all prompted applause monday with forceful statements on red - meat conservative issues			0
@entity136 repeated that he would be uncomfortable with a @entity291 in his cabinet unless he was sure it was n't one " trying to kill us , " while @entity81 and @entity25 backed a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and woman			1
@entity81 , however , broke from most of the other contenders by backing the repeal of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy barring openly gay military personnel			2
@entity2 ireporter @entity303 challenged the value of the entire debate , saying it " lacked intellect			0
" " we heard nothing but talking points , " he said			0
" we 've given these guys a platform to spill talking points that ultimately will never solve @entity65 's problems			0
" @entity2 's @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 and @entity320 contributed to this report .			0
