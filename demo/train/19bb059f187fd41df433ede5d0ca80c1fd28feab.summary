-- after all the doubts and fears , the @entity1 finally began on thursday -- even if the sporting action did get underway ahead of the opening ceremony officially opening the @entity6			1
that has not happened since the @entity8 of 1984 but this will matter little to @entity11 's @entity10 , who had the honor of being the first athlete to compete in @entity14			1
the snowboarder was competing in slopestyle , which is making its debut at this year 's games			1
the two other disciplines that took place on thursday were the womens ' moguls and the men 's team figure skating			2
the latter event was also making its debut , in a bid to emulate the drama and emotion found in the @entity31 ' gymnastics event , and was the highlight of the opening day for host nation @entity34			1
all eyes were on @entity36 , who may be a three - time @entity37 medalist but whose presence in @entity14 was marked by controversy			1
despite ruling himself out of contention for the @entity31 , the 31 - year - old was named as the only male figure skater in the @entity34 team ahead of younger colleagues , notably 18 - year - old national champion @entity46			1
inside the @entity49 , the 2006 olympic gold medalist wowed the locals with a glittering performance as he put his own concerns about his aging and aching body to one side to register a personal best of 91.39			2
" after 12 surgeries on my body , that i can skate in a fourth @entity31 is great , " said @entity36 , who has undergone surgery on his spine and knees in recent years			1
" when i came on the ice , everywhere everybody was screaming and shouting			2
i was a bit shocked			2
i felt kind of dizzy			2
" lapped up by the partisan spectators , with tennis star @entity67 among their number , the man nicknamed ' @entity69 ' could only place second -- upstaged , perhaps ironically given the nature of his selection , by a teenager			0
@entity74 's @entity73 , 19 , freely admits that @entity36 was his idol when growing up but he bettered his idol by some distance when scoring 97.98 points			0
" @entity36 to me is a hero and it felt great just to take to the same ice as him , " said @entity73 , whose @entity74 sit fourth in the ten - team field			0
thanks to a fine display from @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity34 finished the day in pole position , their 19 points two better than @entity87 with @entity88 sitting on 15			0
the ladies short program , the ice dance short dance and the pairs free skate final will take place on saturday with men 's and women 's free skating and the team ice dance final on sunday			0
in the slopestyle , @entity101 came into the games as one of @entity87 's brightest medal hopes but he failed to qualify automatically for saturday 's final and so must make it through the semifinals earlier that day			1
despite breaking a rib two weeks ago , the 20 - year - old refused to blame the injury for his poor performance			0
@entity112 is one of nearly 3,000 athletes who will compete for 98 gold medals over the next 16 days , with athletes from 87 different countries taking part in @entity14			1
' @entity118 and @entity119 ' on thursday , @entity121 secretary - general ban ki - moon expressed his hopes that the international event will overcome the negative vibes that have clouded its preparations			1
while security fears have dominated the international media because of simmering tensions in the nearby @entity130 region of the country , where @entity133 separatists have conducted a string of deadly attacks , a great deal of attention has also focused on @entity34 's anti-gay laws			0
" i hope that this @entity31 will be the venue where people , regardless of their sexual orientation , will really be able to enjoy harmony , friendship and mutual respect , and compete in the spirit of the @entity37 movement , " said the @entity139 in his keynote address to the @entity142			0
" that is what the @entity34 government is committed to , and that is what i am assured by president @entity156			0
" " i know principle six of the @entity158 enshrines the @entity142 's opposition to any form of discrimination , " he added			0
@entity162 did not specifically address the situation in @entity34 , whose parliament passed a hugely controversial law banning the dissemination of " gay propaganda " to minors last year			0
the ruling prompted some to call for a boycott of the @entity6			0
on friday , more than 24 hours after the first athletes competed , @entity14 will officially start with an opening ceremony about which little is known			1
tipped to feature a light show and music , organizers will be hoping that the inevitable fireworks are restricted to the sky -- and not to a games whose buildup has been anything but dazzling .			2

action begins ahead of opening ceremony for first time in 30 years
