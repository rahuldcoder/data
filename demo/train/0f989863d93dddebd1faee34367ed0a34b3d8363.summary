@entity0 , march 6 1957			1
tens of thousands of rejoicing people flood the streets of the city center			0
shouts of " freedom , freedom " fill the air as men , women and children sing and dance , celebrating the birth of a new state and the beginning of a new era : an independent @entity17			2
at midnight on that historic day , @entity19 's @entity18 was taken down above @entity20 in the capital , replaced by @entity17 's new flag -- a black star at the heart of a red , gold and green tricolor			1
at that moment , to the cheering of an ecstatic crowd , @entity17 became the first @entity30 country south of the @entity31 to break the chains of colonialism			1
the event triggered a liberation movement that was destined to sweep the entire continent and eventually lead to the demise of colonial rule in @entity39			2
in the years since independence @entity17 has navigated tumultuous periods of army rule and political uncertainty			1
however the @entity30 country is hailed as one of the continent 's success stories -- the international community has often lauded @entity17 as a beacon of peace and stability while @entity53 president @entity52 called it a " model for democracy " in @entity39			1
@entity57 history located on the coast of the @entity59 , @entity17 is a country of more than 25 million people , known for its rich history , cultural heritage and natural beauty			1
the country is often described as " @entity39 for beginners , " combining long stretches of sandy beaches , lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife			1
the country takes its name from a great ancient kingdom , situated some 500 miles northwest of the modern - day state , which flourished until the 13th century			2
@entity17 was formerly known as the @entity75 because of the abundance of the precious metal found there			1
the first contact with @entity80 began in the late 15th century with the arrival of @entity83 sailors and the establishment of direct commercial sea routes with @entity80 -- mainly as a supplier of gold			0
over the following centuries , traders from @entity19 , the @entity90 and other @entity80 countries also joined in , as the focus shifted to the lucrative export of slaves amid a growing demand for labor in the @entity53 and @entity98 plantations			2
during that period , several stone forts and castles were erected along the coast , many of which dot @entity17 's shores to this day			1
slave forts like @entity107 and @entity108 have become significant historical monuments that attract many visitors , especially people of @entity30 descent from the @entity53 by the latter decades of the 19th century , the @entity113 and the @entity90 were the only @entity80 traders still operating on the coast , while the union of the @entity117 states , centered in the city of @entity119 , became increasingly dominant			0
in 1874 , two years after the final withdrawal of the @entity90 and following several hard - fought battles with the @entity117 , the @entity75 was declared a @entity113 colony			2
rocky road after gaining its independence from the @entity113 , @entity17 was proclaimed a republic in 1960			2
one of the first civil engineering projects of the new nation was the @entity128 completed in 1965			0
it created @entity130 , one of the world 's largest man - made lakes and brought electricity to millions			0
to this day hydroelectricity accounts for around 85 % of the country 's electricity generation , according to the @entity138			0
however in the years that followed independence , the newborn state was hit by severe economic and political troubles			0
@entity144 leader @entity143 became known as the founding father of @entity146 -- an ideology of @entity30 solidarity that spread across the continent and the wider world			0
he led the country as president until he was toppled by a military coup in 1966 amid growing dissatisfaction over corruption , declining living standards and spiraling foreign debts			0
although a general election was successfully held in 1969 , @entity17 was soon to enter a new period of political uncertainty and economic stagnation that lasted for more than a decade			1
a series of coups and countercoups began in 1972 and continued until the early 1980s when a former air force second lieutenant called @entity166 solidified power			0
gradually , economic and political conditions in the country improved and @entity170 went on to win two presidential elections in 1992 and 1996			0
he was replaced by @entity173 in 2001 , in what was the first peaceful transfer of power between democratically elected governments since 1957			0
@entity177 won the 2008 elections and remained president until his death in june 2012			0
he was immediately replaced by @entity181 , formerly @entity17 's vice president , who was sworn in as the country 's new president -- a position he holds to this day after winning the elections on december 7 , 2012			1
gold , cocoa and oil despite its relatively small size , @entity17 is today one of @entity39 's leading countries and one of the few in the continent expected to meet the @entity195 of halving the poverty rate by 2015			1
it has one of the fastest growing economies in the continent , driven largely by its rich natural resources and strong agricultural production			0
gold and cocoa are both traditionally major sources of foreign currency for the country , while in 2007 economic expectations were raised higher following the discovery of major offshore oil reserves .			1

@entity17 gained independence from @entity19 in march 1957 ; formerly named @entity75
@entity212 's first few decades were witness to internal political *upheaval*
now the country is held up as a successful example of democracy in @entity39
gold and cocoa are traditional exports ; 2007 off - shore oil discovery could boost economy
