more : the @entity41 : ending modern - day slavery according to @entity0 , the average age of entry into the sex trade is 13			1
" and that 's globally , by the way , " added the actor , who also pointed out that many @entity4 view child sex slavery as a problem in places that they have no control over , such as @entity52 , @entity53 or @entity54			1
@entity0 wants to people to realize trafficking is prevalent in the @entity4 , too			1
traffickers are often " @entity60 , " usually in their early 30s			0
" and what they 're really doing , " said @entity0 , " is profiting off the sale of these women and girls			0
" these men seem like perfect guys to vulnerable girls from broken homes			0
pimps start off nice and generous in a ritual that @entity12 likens to " courting			2
" sometimes they meet the girls online , establish relationships with them , take them shopping , make them comfortable and gain their trust			0
one of the so - called faces of human trafficking joined " @entity17 " under concealed identity from an undisclosed location to provide a first - hand account of what @entity5 called " the horrors of sex trafficking			2
" the 17 - year - old girl went by the name " @entity85 " for the purposes of the interview			2
when @entity85 -- who is an @entity4 citizen -- was 13 , her father went to jail while her mother battled drug addiction			2
@entity85 began establishing relationships with men online , leading to a cycle of pimps , drug problems and even jail			0
@entity12 recalled the story of a girl who , now 18 , was just 11 when she was taken in by a pimp			1
in a similar fashion , he took her to @entity103 's , took her to the mall and made her feel safe			2
pretty soon she was forced into child prostitution and given a $ 1,500 - a - night quota			2
if she did n't meet her quota , she was beaten or forced to sit in a tub of ice			0
her pimp 's nickname was " @entity113 " because the girls he overpowered were extremely young			0
according to the girl , @entity12 said , the pimp would load the girls into an overcrowded car -- so crowded that some rode in the trunk -- drive to @entity119 , place ads on @entity121 and have the girls prostituting almost immediately			1
@entity122 , author of " @entity123 , inside the @entity124 " also joined the show			0

" @entity12 reiterated that she and @entity0 initiated the campaign " to create awareness			1
you have to acknowledge a problem exists before you can actually go about finding a solution , " she said			0
" and what we 've found is that most people are n't even aware of what 's going on			1
" @entity12 and @entity0 maintain that they will remain committed to the cause no matter how long it takes to eradicate child sex slavery			1
@entity5 asked the couple famously addicted to @entity146 -- @entity0 has 6.5 million followers , @entity12 has 3.5 million -- if it is smart to use social media as a tool to spread the word about their campaign when social media often makes it easier for child sex traffickers to operate			1
" for me , " said @entity0 , " i think i looked at this platform and thought to myself , ' this could be the collective consciousness , right ? ' this platform , in and of itself , a little shout here , and a little shout there			0
but the key was being able to drive a link into deeper , richer content into a tweet , and then have that tweet be syndicated			0
" i do n't believe that there 's a problem in the world that exists that the solutions did n't exist before the problem			2
so that 's why we 're using social media for this campaign , " he said			0
" it 's to actually go right into the heart of where it 's taking place			0
seventy - six percent of the transactions for child sex slavery is actually happening online			1
so if we can motivate people while they are online to do something about that , then we can make a dent			0
" furthermore , @entity0 urged people to visit sites such as @entity121 and flag pages that appear to be about child trafficking			2
" people can start to actually un-root this at its root , " said @entity0 , who urged people to go to @entity190 / @entity189 , put themselves in a video , share that video with friends and go to the action tab where the foundation outlines online initiatives			0
" we want the social web to become the police for human trafficking online , " @entity0 told @entity5			0
