@entity0 -- lawyers for @entity3 wrapped up their case against his extradition to @entity6 on tuesday and challenged a @entity6 prosecutor to " come to @entity0 " to defend her handling of the sexual misconduct allegations facing the @entity11 founder			1
" today , we have seen a @entity15 without the princess -- a prosecutor who has been ready to feed the media within information , but has been unwilling to come here , " @entity3 attorney @entity12 told reporters outside a south @entity0 courtroom			1
@entity12 called on @entity6 prosecutor @entity20 to attend the extradition hearing when it resumes friday and " subject yourself to the cross-examination			2
" @entity3 has not been charged with a crime , but @entity6 prosecutors want to question him in connection with sexual misconduct allegations related to separate incidents last august			1
@entity3 denies the accusations , and his attorneys are fighting his extradition on procedural and human - rights grounds			1
the case is not related to the work of the website , which has facilitated the leaking of thousands of secret documents on subjects ranging from the war in @entity40 to the inner workings of @entity43 diplomacy			0
@entity3 said the hearing is lifting the lid on allegations he says are false and have blighted his reputation for months , telling reporters after tuesday 's proceedings that he is facing " the unlimited budget of @entity6 and the @entity51 on this matter			1
" @entity3 's lawyers say @entity20 ordered his arrest without formally summoning him for an interview or requesting an interrogation			1
they also argue that @entity6 could send him to the @entity43 to face espionage charges related to his site 's disclosure of thousands of secret @entity43 military and diplomatic documents			2
former @entity6 prosecutor @entity62 testified tuesday that @entity6 authorities should not have told the media that @entity3 was accused of rape			1
but @entity62 seemed unimpressed by some elements of the defense , including the claim that @entity3 could be sent on to the @entity43 to face imprisonment in @entity70 or execution			0
he said @entity3 did not run that risk , in his opinion			0
prosecutor @entity74 , representing @entity6 , dismissed the defense claim that @entity6 would hand @entity3 over to the @entity43			1
the " suggestion that @entity6 provides no protection against human rights violations is unfounded , " @entity76 argued , adding that @entity51 would have the right to intervene if @entity78 asked @entity6 for @entity3			2
@entity3 is free on 200,000 pounds ( $ 310,000 ) bail while he fights extradition			0
@entity51 courts have ordered him to stay at a supporter 's mansion outside @entity0 each night , to wear an electronic tag that monitors his location and to check in daily with police			2
proceedings are set to resume friday at @entity91 in south @entity0			0
" for the past five and a half months , we have been in a condition where a black box has been applied to my life , " @entity3 said after monday 's session			2
" on the outside of that black box has been written the word ' rape			0
' that box is now , thanks to an open court process , being opened , and i hope over the next day we will see that that box is , in fact , empty and has nothing to do with the words that are on the outside of it			0
" testifying for the defense on monday , retired @entity112 judge @entity111 harshly criticized @entity20 , who issued an arrest warrant for @entity3 in the case			2
@entity111 said @entity20 has a " rather biased view against men " and has " lost balance " on sexual offenses after years of working with battered women			0
@entity111 said @entity20 could have pursued more straightforward approaches , such as questioning by telephone , for the preliminary investigation			0
and @entity123 , a @entity6 activist for legal reform in sex - offense cases , testified that he approached police to raise doubts about one of @entity3 's accusers			1
@entity123 said the woman , identified as " @entity131 , " made @entity133 postings 20 hours after the alleged offenses that described being positive and happy in @entity3 's company			1
@entity3 's lawyers argue @entity51 can not extradite @entity3 without violation of his human rights , because doing so puts him at risk of execution , according to an outline of their defense published on their website			1
" there is a real risk he could be made subject to the death penalty , " @entity3 lawyers say , citing @entity51 media reports that @entity43 @entity152 politicians @entity150 and @entity153 have called for him to be executed			1
they also say he should not be sent to @entity6 because rape trials there are held behind closed doors , while @entity51 trials are open			0
@entity123 said @entity131 erased the postings when she reported the alleged crime , but prosecutors said @entity131 told @entity123 she deleted them to avoid a media storm			0
@entity123 also said that that two days after the alleged crime , @entity131 wanted to become @entity3 's personal press liaison officer			2
he told @entity1 he is not an @entity3 supporter			0
@entity1 's @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
