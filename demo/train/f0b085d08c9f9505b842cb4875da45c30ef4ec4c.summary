-- on the day @entity4 was named as @entity6 's wealthiest man , his soccer club @entity1 overtook that of one of his " rich list " rivals in the race for a @entity13 place next season			1
@entity4 , the @entity18 team 's joint - biggest shareholder along with @entity20 @entity19 , is worth £ 13.3 billion ( $ 20.2 billion ) according to the annual @entity22 table -- a rise of almost £ 1 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) since last year			1
@entity1 moved up into third place in the @entity25 with saturday 's 1 - 0 win at @entity27 , putting @entity29 's side two points above @entity31 -- owned by @entity4 's fellow @entity33 @entity32			1
@entity32 is fifth on the @entity22 list with an estimated wealth of £ 9.3 billion ( £ 14.16 billion ) -- a drop of two places			2
his team 's fortunes have also been sliding since last year 's @entity13 success , but the @entity41 can regain third with victory in sunday 's trip to @entity44			1
defeat , however , could allow fifth - placed @entity45 to join @entity31 on 61 points if the @entity48 side beat second - placed @entity49 earlier in the day			0
despite moving five points clear of @entity45 , @entity1 's top - four hopes remain in the balance , having played two more matches than both @entity48 rivals			1
the @entity55 next face runaway leaders @entity57 , but the final three games are against teams near the bottom of the table			0
" we are on a strong run and we just go into the next game and focus on winning that , " @entity29 told @entity1 's website			0
" the next game will be @entity57 so it 's a good challenge for us			0
" defender @entity66 scored the only goal against @entity27 just before halftime , as the home team had former @entity1 midfielder @entity70 sent off for a rash lunge on @entity72 early on -- his second red card in as many matches			1
@entity1 also ended the game with 10 men after @entity77 striker @entity76 was sent off			0
" he said to me that he slipped at the moment he went for the ball , and it 's confirmed by the television , " @entity29 said			0
" i have n't seen it but he 's not a tackler			0
" he went over the ball and , knowing that @entity70 had been sent off before , i had no illusion of the color of the card			0
" another club with connections to a man on the rich list took another step towards relegation on saturday as @entity94 lost 2 - 0 at home to @entity96			1
@entity98 steel magnate @entity97 retained a one - third stake in @entity94 after @entity101 businessman @entity100 became principal shareholder in 2011 , but the club 's fortunes have mirrored his own			1
@entity97 had been @entity6 's wealthiest man eight years in a row , but has dropped to fourth on £ 10 billion ( $ 15 billion ) -- with £ 2.7 billion ( $ 4.1 billion ) wiped off his value			1
his shares in @entity94 may also be worth considerably less if the club returns to the second division after just two seasons in the @entity25 , despite having spent large sums on players under @entity100 -- that will happen on monday if @entity113 manage an unlikely victory against @entity57			2
saturday 's defeat left the @entity48 club level on points with bottom side @entity118 , who lost 2 - 1 at @entity121 , while @entity96 climbed six points clear of the relegation zone after ending a run of six defeats and a draw			2
it put @entity96 on 37 points along with @entity129 -- who held eighth - placed @entity131 1 - 1 -- and @entity132 , whose 1 - 0 win over @entity134 was the second successive victory for new manager @entity136			0
@entity132 's victory -- the club 's second since january 23 -- dented sixth - placed @entity134 's hopes of @entity142 qualification , leaving @entity144 ' team two points behind @entity45 having played two more matches			2
@entity147 stayed in the third and final relegation place after a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity147 , while ninth - placed @entity150 drew 0 - 0 with @entity151 , who stayed 12th .			0

derby victory gives @entity1 the edge in race for @entity13 place
win at 10 - man @entity27 comes as shareholder @entity4 is named @entity6 's richest
it lifts club above @entity31 , owned by fellow @entity33 *billionaire* @entity32
former rich list leader @entity97 drops to fifth as relegation looms for his club @entity94
