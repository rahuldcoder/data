-- one of four former @entity6 leaders charged with crimes against humanity was ruled unfit to stand trial and could be set free , a spokesman for the special @entity3 court in @entity4 said thursday			1
@entity10 said the @entity11 in the @entity12 decided that @entity13 , the 78 - year - old former minister of social affairs in the @entity6 regime , was " not fit to stand trial as she has dementia			1
" prosecutors have 24 hours to object to the court 's decision , @entity18 said			2
if there is no objection , @entity13 will be released , he added			2
opening statements by the defendants are scheduled for monday			0
@entity13 was the only woman among the four defendants in the trial , which charges surviving leaders of the four - year @entity6 regime in the 1970s with crimes against humanity , grave breaches of the @entity38 , genocide , homicide , torture and religious persecution			1
the other defendants are her husband , @entity40 , the former @entity6 foreign minister ; @entity41 , the nominal head of state ; and @entity43 , the prime minister , also known as brother @entity43			2
the head of the @entity6 , @entity45 , was known as brother number 1			0
he died in 1998 , long before the @entity3 - backed court came into existence			1
under @entity45 's leadership , the @entity6 regime was responsible for the deaths of millions of ordinary @entity4 during a four - year reign of terror that was eventually halted in 1979 by invading @entity54 forces			1
in 1975 , the @entity6 ordered people out of @entity56 , the capital , and other cities in @entity4 to work in the countryside			1
it is said to be responsible for about 1.7 million deaths , roughly a quarter of the population at the time			1
its stated aim was to create a @entity65 utopia , but instead the regime forced @entity4 into what has been described as a living hell			2
city - dwellers were marched into the countryside and forced to work as farm laborers			0
those already living in rural @entity4 were expected to produce enough food for the country while teaching farming to those who had never done it before			0
currency was abolished , and anyone with an education was considered a threat			0
no one was allowed modern medicine , and the country isolated itself in an effort to become completely self - sufficient			0
the results were disastrous : people died of starvation and disease as soldiers tortured and killed anyone suspected of being disloyal			0
in the end , virtually everyone , including the soldiers , became a target due to the leadership 's paranoia .			0

the special @entity3 court in @entity4 decides @entity13 has dementia
three others , include @entity13 's husband , face charges of crimes against humanity
the @entity6 regime 's four - year rule in the 1970s is blamed for 1.7 million deaths
