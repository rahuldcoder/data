@entity0 , @entity1 -- a series of explosions rocked central @entity0 early monday , the day after @entity1 security forces said they repulsed a wave of insurgent attacks in the capital and three other provinces			1
the explosions persisted for some time , and followed periodic gunfire that lasted well into sunday night in the @entity0 district that houses government offices and allied embassies			1
there was no immediate explanation , but @entity1 authorities had said late sunday that they were trying to dislodge insurgents holed up in an empty building near the headquarters of @entity23 's @entity22			1
@entity25 spokesman @entity24 said the remaining insurgents " have no choice except surrendering or to be killed by the @entity1 forces			2
" " they came today with more than 20 insurgents and suicide bombers and attacked four provinces , " @entity24 told @entity2 sunday			0
" as a result , they got nothing , and 19 of them were killed			0
" the assault was a rare occurrence in a heavily guarded part of @entity0 -- but gen. @entity40 , the @entity41 and @entity23 commander in @entity1 , said the @entity1 beat back the insurgents without allied assistance			1
" they were on scene immediately , well - led and well - coordinated , " @entity40 said			0
" they integrated their efforts , helped protect their fellow citizens and largely kept the insurgents contained			0
" he said the attacks were meant to signal " that legitimate governance and @entity1 sovereignty are in peril , " but the @entity1 response " is proof enough of that folly			1
" @entity24 said two civilians were killed across the country , and 15 @entity1 police officers were wounded			2
he said 15 of 19 suicide bombers were stopped before they could blow themselves up , with most of them killed by @entity1 security forces			2
and @entity64 , a spokesman for the @entity65 , said three men arrested in @entity0 confessed to plotting to kill @entity67 , @entity1 's second vice president			1
two of the men planned to blow themselves up in @entity67 's home , @entity64 said			0
the @entity72 militia that once ruled most of @entity1 claimed responsibility for the attacks , saying it launched fighters into battle with suicide vests , rpgs and hand grenades in @entity0 and the provinces of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
but @entity64 said the three men who targeted @entity67 confessed to being members of the @entity86 , a separate insurgent group that sometimes allies itself with the @entity72			2
in his statement , @entity40 said , " no one is underestimating the seriousness of today 's attacks			2
" but @entity22 spokesman lt. col. @entity94 described himself as " underwhelmed , " and @entity41 ambassador @entity95 told @entity2 , " the @entity72 are very good at issuing statements , less good at fighting			0
" @entity95 told @entity2 's " @entity99 " that no @entity41 had been hurt , but " our hearts go out " to the @entity1 who had been killed or wounded			1
he suggested the attacks may be the work of the @entity86 , rather than the @entity72 , saying the @entity72 did not have the capacity to carry them out			1
@entity23 's @entity22 said as many as seven locations in @entity0 were attacked , including @entity1 's parliament building and the @entity41 , @entity106 and @entity107 embassies			1
@entity24 said the insurgents took up positions in empty buildings in three @entity0 districts to carry out the attacks , and still held one as midnight neared sunday			1
@entity0 police said they found and detonated a van full of explosives			0
meanwhile , an airbase used by @entity41 troops in the eastern city of @entity121 , in @entity123 province , also came under attack , the @entity23 command in @entity0 reported			1
four suicide bombers wearing women 's burqas tried to attack the @entity121 airfield where @entity41 troops are based , airfield commander @entity125 said			1
at least three of the attackers were killed , @entity22 said in a statement about the incident			0
separately , a group of suicide bombers attacked the police training center in the city of @entity139 , in nearby @entity82 province			0
at least eight civilians were wounded , said a police official at the center , who is not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named			0
and 15 would - be attackers were arrested in @entity146 plotting similar strikes , said @entity148 , a spokesman for the chief of police for north and northeast @entity1			0
the @entity72 , the @entity152 militia that once ruled most of @entity1 , said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing of 17 @entity1 civilians in @entity157 last month			2
a @entity159 staff sergeant , @entity158 , has been charged with those killings			0
but @entity161 , an expert on the @entity86 at the @entity163 - based @entity162 , told @entity2 that the coordination seen in the @entity0 attacks indicate a @entity86 - led network was behind them , and that planned but disrupted attacks in the north may also be @entity86 - linked			1
" this is likely their unofficial announcement marking the start of the spring fighting season , " @entity161 said			0
though the attacks did n't succeed , he said , " the target selection was likely intended to send a message to the @entity41 , @entity175 , @entity107 and the @entity1 that this will in fact be a bloody year for all forces in @entity1 , particularly the east of the country			1
" @entity41 @entity181 spokesman @entity180 said he could not confirm that the embassy itself was the target of the attacks , but said gunfire had been heard in the vicinity			2
in a statement from @entity190 , foreign secretary @entity188 said the @entity175 @entity181 was one of the targets , but " every member of @entity181 staff is safe			0
" " the @entity195 responded to the attacks bravely , promptly and effectively , once again illustrating the significant progress that has been made in ensuring that @entity1 can look after their own security , " @entity188 said			2
the embassy premises sustained " limited damage , " he said , and its staff " dealt with this dangerous situation extremely professionally			0
" @entity203 also said it had no reports of its nationals being wounded			0
a local police official said attackers took over a central @entity0 hotel close to the presidential palace , @entity212 office and many foreign embassies , but both @entity24 and staff at the hotel denied it had been attacked			2
a western official in @entity0 later said the hotel had been taken over by insurgents , but was then taken back by @entity1 national security forces			1
@entity2 's @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 , @entity223 correspondent @entity222 and foreign affairs correspondent @entity224 contributed to this report .			0
