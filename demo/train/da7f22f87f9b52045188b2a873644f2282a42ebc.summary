@entity0 , @entity1 -- a picture postcard beach on one of @entity1 's most popular tourist islands is now the focus of frantic efforts to staunch a tide of oil sweeping ashore			1
where pleasure seekers would normally relax on pristine white sand , sandwiched between two lush green headlands , now white - coated cleanup crew smeared with crude suck oil from the shallow waters			1
@entity18 of oil lie along the beach , a thin sheen covers much of the wet sand and oil - drenched booms lie like giant black snakes along the shoreline			1
the sea is a rust red color and the odor of fuel hangs heavy in the air			0
not even a brisk onshore wind can keep the smell away			0
for the past four days crude has been washing up here and cleanup crews have been dealing with it the best way they can -- pumping it into holding tanks , containing it with booms , even mopping it up with absorbent pads			1

about 600 soldiers , volunteers and workers from @entity55 , the partially state - owned oil giant that has claimed responsibility for the spill , are involved in the cleanup			1
a @entity55 spokesman says that 70 % of the oil has been dealt with			1
the remaining crude will be " 90 % clear by friday or sunday at the latest			1
" in some ways @entity1 has been lucky			1
there are more than 200 oil installations in the @entity64 , which co-exist uneasily in an area known as the marine bread basket of the country			2
this spill appears to have been contained to one -- more remote -- beach on the island			1
the more popular resort areas a few kilometers further south say there is little evidence of the spill			2
that 's not stopping the tourists leaving though			0
resort operators say many have left , fearing their holiday will be ruined			0
but this is low season here with occupancy around 30 %			2
the economic damage would have been far worse a few months from now when most tourists visit , many from the capital @entity87 , 230km to the northwest			0
local fisherman say they 've caught fewer fish over the last few days , but it 's too early to estimate the damage to fish stocks			0
there are no signs of affected marine or bird life at @entity100			0
the focus is now switching to how this happened			0
a @entity55 spokesman told @entity2 that the leak on saturday happened as a tanker was transferring crude to an undersea pipe			1
a giant flexible rubber hose used to transport the oil began to leak			2
the hose is replaced every two years			0
this one had been in operation for just one year			0
it 's being sent to the manufacturer , @entity115 , for further tests			0
@entity55 is also defending accusations that it has underplayed the amount of oil that leaked			1
according to academics at two universities , satellite pictures of the spill , and the amount of dispersants used suggests it could have been twice as big -- 100,000 liters or about 26,000 gallons			2
@entity55 says it is " confident " of its own calculations			2
the @entity1 energy ministry has promised the results of an investigation within seven days			2
it 's a race against time			0
every day , the pictures of the spill are flashed around the world increases the likelihood that tourists -- so important to this country 's economy -- will go elsewhere for their fun in the sun.			0
