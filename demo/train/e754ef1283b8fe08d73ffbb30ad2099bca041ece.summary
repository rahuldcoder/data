-- @entity1 is making @entity2 a little nervous			1
@entity2 , a longtime fan of the airline , already bought her @entity5 plane ticket to fly from @entity6 to @entity7 to visit her grandsons next month			1
" i choose @entity5 because it 's a straight flight , no stops , and it 's the right time , ( but ) i do have some angst about my flight being canceled , " she said			1
who wants to fly @entity5 ? the troubled airline has been beset by labor troubles , delays and flight cancellations and , most recently , two aircraft that could n't keep several seats in place			1
@entity5 , which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year , persuaded a judge to throw out its contract with the pilots union last month			1
since then , the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket			1
broken coffee pots and reading lights , torn seat pockets and precautionary maintenance checks that lead to nothing wrong : those are some of the complaints by pilots that are slowing @entity5 flights , according to spokesman @entity40			1
@entity1 plane makes emergency landing " clearly , our operation is nowhere near where we want it to be , where it has historically been and the kind of quality operation @entity1 runs day in and day out , " @entity40 told @entity0 in an interview two weeks ago			1
" we are working as hard as we can to try and mitigate this and do all we can to resolve it			0
we certainly understand ; we very much do apologize for any delay or cancellation that we have seen			0
" the solution , @entity40 said , is for the pilots to stop their slowdown			0
the airline threatened last week to seek an injunction in court , if the pilots union does n't " take steps to end the disruption of @entity5 's operations by some pilots , " according to a letter to the union from @entity64 , @entity5 's senior vice president / people			2
customers are piling on stories of @entity5 employees making choices that upset their customers are starting to proliferate , possibly driving existing customers away			1
in his " friends do n't let @entity86 " blog post on @entity89 , @entity77 wrote of a delayed first flight turning into a missed connection because the pilot chose to leave rather than let a group of passengers on board two minutes before his scheduled departure time			2
at least that flight left on time			0
@entity91 described a trans - @entity93 flight that should have taken a few hours turning into a 30 - hour kafkaesque ordeal that included a stop in a third country			0
@entity97 came off looking good in his absurdly humorous @entity99 tale			0
travel agents shying away travel agents say they ca n't count on @entity5 flights to depart -- or those that do depart to land on time			1
so they started directing their customers away from @entity5 after the troubled airline began canceling flights last month			1
in the past month , more than 1,000 @entity5 flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed			1
" it 's just getting too risky with the threat of probable cancellations on the horizon , " said @entity110 , president of @entity111 , a @entity112 travel agency in @entity113 , @entity114 , that temporarily halted sales of @entity5 tickets until " we have confidence that there will not be widespread cancellations			1
" " it 's an unfortunate situation , as we really do n't have a lot of other options , especially to the @entity128 , where they dominate the market , " he said			0
" to be proactive , we are in the process of looking for alternative flights for those passengers who have booked refundable tickets			0
" why did aircraft seats get loose ? passengers already feeling the bumpy impact of that labor dispute had another concern over the weekend when a row of seats dislodged during a flight and prompted an emergency landing , the airline said monday			0
a @entity145 757 from @entity146 to @entity147 carrying 175 passengers diverted to @entity7 's @entity149 on saturday when three seats in row 12 came loose shortly after takeoff			0
a second @entity5 @entity145 returned to @entity149 on monday morning after a similar seats issue was discovered			2
" an initial internal investigation into why a row of seats became loose on two @entity1 @entity158 has indicated that there could be a possible issue with a certain model of seats and how they fit into the tracking used to secure the seats , " the airline said in a statement			2
" out of an abundance of caution , @entity5 has decided to proactively reinspect eight 757s today that could possibly have this same issue			2
the seats were installed by @entity5 maintenance and contract maintenance			2
the issue does not seem to be tied to any one maintenance facility or one work group			0
" this afternoon , the company flew engineers , tech crew chiefs and inspectors from its @entity180 maintenance base to @entity7 to evaluate the aircraft and determine the next course of action to correct the problem			0
" the @entity185 , the largest independent pilot union and a certified collective bargaining agent for the 10,000 @entity5 pilots , said the interior overhaul of the @entity146 plane was performed by third - party maintenance workers , according to spokesman @entity191			2
' i 'm not looking for headaches ' one @entity195 - based travel agent shifted one set of clients traveling to @entity198 this fall from an @entity5 flight to a @entity201 flight			1
" @entity202 was about the same			0
@entity5 had a slightly better schedule , but i am not looking for headaches and canceled flights are big headaches			1
" " in our business , it is very hard to recommend something that you know is not certain , " wrote the travel agent , who did n't want to be named , in an e-mail			0
" any time you have labor disputes and / or financial problems , the dependability factor goes down			0
" @entity220 use picking up in cockpits teen with @entity223 stopped from boarding plane golden days of air travel : how glorious were they ?			0
