after three years of seesaw battles with the regime , @entity3 rebels now face another daunting challenge : fending off radical @entity6 militants who are taking over swaths of the country			1
the @entity9 in @entity10 and @entity3 ( @entity11 ) has gained notoriety in recent weeks as the group captured city after city in @entity10			1
its goal : to create a caliphate , or @entity19 state , spanning @entity10 and @entity3			1
now , the crises in both countries are blending into a combined regional disaster as @entity11 now controls land on both sides of the border -- opening the floodgates for weapons and fighters between @entity3 and @entity10			1

the land grabs by @entity11 now stretch from @entity3 's @entity31 province to the group 's recently gained territories in @entity10 's @entity6 heartland , the opposition @entity52 ( @entity52 ) said			1
while @entity11 has controlled parts of @entity3 for some time now , the group was fighting to open a route between its captures in @entity10 and in @entity3			1
that victory came thursday , when @entity11 wrested control of the @entity65 border crossing and all the cities between the crossing and @entity31 city from @entity3 rebels			1
some @entity3 turn to @entity11 @entity11 has gained not just cities , but also some @entity3 ' claims of allegiance			1
after capturing the town of @entity74 , @entity11 demanded last week that fighters surrender their weapons and repent for fighting @entity11			1
the militants then called on residents to leave the town for a week to 10 days until " peace returns to the streets , " according to a social media video obtained by activists			0
in a video statement , leaders in the town of @entity74 announced their withdrawal from all @entity88 groups			0
a town representative announced by video that they " decided to swear allegiance " to shadowy @entity11 leader @entity92			0
but about 30,000 people have fled the town , @entity34 said			0
other @entity3 flee days after their land grabs across @entity31 province , @entity11 militants have not let residents return to the towns of @entity101 and @entity102 , the @entity52 said			1
about 15,000 people lived in each town			0
the residents were forced to leave on june 23			0
they had been told to " accept their repentance " after fighting @entity11 , the @entity52 said			1
@entity11 militants have already declared they have set up an @entity19 state spanning large areas of the two countries			1
the group called on @entity6 to swear allegiance to the caliphate			0
the message claims that the group 's territory now spans from @entity118 province in northwestern @entity3 to @entity117 in eastern @entity10			2
it announced that @entity11 was changing its name to just the " @entity9			0
" but both @entity121 and @entity6 have been deeply offended by the claim			0
@entity3 rebels demand help a group of 11 battalions fighting @entity11 in @entity3 has threatened to stop battling the insurgents by the end of this week if they do n't get supplies and support from their @entity131 - backed interim government			1
the demand , posted on the @entity134 page of one of the battalions , was addressed to the @entity137 and the @entity3 interim government -- both of which are @entity131 - backed rebel groups fighting the @entity3 regime			0
" we ask for reinforcement and full support to face ( @entity11 ) , and expel them from our land , and stop them from advancing on the liberated cities , " the statement said			2
" if our call is not answered , we will be forced to lay down our weapons and pull our fighters from the areas we control			0
" @entity137 spokeswoman @entity155 relayed the group 's demands to the media , saying @entity11 is not only a threat to @entity3 , but to the @entity161 as well			2
" the @entity35 has made significant gains in @entity3 , but @entity11 has consistently battled them for these areas and often won , " @entity155 said			2
the demands come after @entity11 made advances in @entity31 and , more alarmingly , the suburbs of @entity118 -- @entity3 's largest city , @entity155 said			2
the rebels " have been screaming at the top of their lungs for months for assistance that never came , " @entity155 said			0
" in their statement , they predict that @entity11 will take over all opposition territory in @entity3 unless decisive action is taken promptly			2
