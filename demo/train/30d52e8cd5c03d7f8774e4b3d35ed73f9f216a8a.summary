whatever the six - woman jury mulling the fate of @entity2 decides , the former neighborhood watch volunteer charged with second - degree murder in the fatal shooting of @entity6 can not emerge as a winner , according to his defense attorney			1
asked wednesday what kind of life @entity2 would lead if he were acquitted , @entity9 told @entity13 's @entity12 " not a good one			1
" " he has to live mostly in hiding , he has to protect himself from that periphery that still believe that he 's some racist murderer or acted in a bad way , " @entity9 said			1
" i think that he 's probably concerned about living in @entity17 and never having a normal life , and that 's unfortunate			1
his life will never be the same			2
" did investigators blow the @entity2 case ? @entity9 said he had received dozens of e-mails from people " who are vicious in their hatred for @entity2 -- and for me			1
it 's absurd , but they 're there			2
so , i do n't know which is the one who 's going to walk down the street at the same time @entity2 does			1
they know what he looks like ; he does n't know what they look like			2
" but @entity9 offered no regrets about having taken on the high - profile , racially charged case in april 2012 , two months after the black 17 - year - old was shot dead in a @entity43 , @entity17 , neighborhood while returning home one february night wearing a hoodie sweatshirt and carrying nothing more threatening than a bag of @entity48 and a canned soft drink			1
" it just seemed like it was perfect for me , " the lawyer said			2
" and you overlay that with the social questions about the case , the racism questions , the way this case is being viewed , even the @entity56 itself , it just met on literally all eight cylinders			0
" @entity17 's stand - your - ground law , which allows the use of deadly force by someone facing a reasonable belief of an illegal threat , has also come under scrutiny in the case			0
what about @entity6 's right to ' stand his ground ' ? the defense lawyer said he typically does not even ask his clients -- most of whom " have done something wrong " -- whether they are innocent of whatever charge or charges they face			1
" it 's too personal , in a strange way , " he said			0
but that was not the case with @entity2			1
" once i learned that @entity2 was significantly injured that night , and that he voluntarily complied with all law enforcement requests -- from interviews to voice stress analysis tests to walkthroughs -- i knew that there was something here different than most cases			2
" he said he regretted that the case has divided the country along racial lines , which would not be erased by the verdict			0
" half of the country is going to be upset with the verdict			0
it 's absurd , " he said			0
" and it 's absurd that 75 % of the people who were asked about whether or not @entity2 could get a fair trial a month before the trial started said no. that should never happen in our country			1
there should n't be 1 % of our population who believes that anybody can not get a fair trial			0
" top 10 moments in the @entity2 trial @entity2 's father has accused the counsel of not stating forcefully enough that his son was innocent , but the lawyer defended his actions			1
" while i could have gone up to the top of the stairs and screamed his innocence at the top of my lungs , i would have only incensed those very people who i really wanted to do some reaching out to , " he said			0
he credited that tack with having lowered the intensity of the public anger that boiled over in the initial stages of the case			0
" there are not a lot of people screaming at the top of their lungs any more that @entity2 is a racist , and they 're not even saying that he 's a murderer , " he said			1
" i think people get that he 's a non-racist			0
" @entity9 cited his client 's work as a mentor to black children and his having taken a black girl to his prom as evidence of his nonracist beliefs			1
" you did n't have to scratch very far below the surface to realize that @entity2 is an anti-racist , " he said			1
@entity2 trial : it 's about race @entity9 said he has funded some of the defense work out of his own pocket			1
" people still need to be paid , " he said , " depositions need to be taken			0
" while he welcomed donations from the public , most of them in $ 10 to $ 100 amounts , he said he has rejected " a dozen or thereabouts " donations that came with messages expressing racist points of view			0
this trial would never have happened -- and @entity2 would never be the subject of death threats , even if he 's acquitted -- if it were n't for the efforts of lawyers for @entity6 's family , led by @entity167 , contends @entity9			1
" they victimized him , " the defense lawyer said			1
" @entity2 was victimized by a publicity campaign to smear him , to call him a racist when he was n't , and to call him a murderer when he was n't			1
" when confronted with these comments friday night , @entity167 countered by saying that @entity2 's team " seemed to forget that @entity6 was dead , ( an ) unarmed kid on the ground who his client profiled , followed , pursued and shot in the heart			1
" " they had ... a confessed killer , and they were n't going to arrest him , " @entity167 told @entity13 's @entity178 , adding that he felt compelled to help @entity6 's parents press the case			1
" there 's something wrong with that			2
" on the other side , @entity9 said politics appeared to have affected the way the case was handled by the prosecution			2
he noted that a special prosecutor was brought in " when there does n't seem to be any reason why , " and that " most good analysts " believed the charges filed were " an abomination			2
" but he had praise for judge @entity199 , who has overseen the case			0
" even though the rulings did not go our way like i would like them to , she was always well - prepared			0
she does her case law research , she does her homework , " he said			0
" you mention a case , she knows the case			0
those are the signs of a very good judge			0
" he predicted that justice would ultimately prevail in the form of an acquittal for @entity2 but acknowledged that the jury deliberation would be a difficult time for him			2
" i ca n't eat , i ca n't work , i just have to wait , it is the worst thing , " he said			0
" it 's sort of like waiting for a child to be born or something			0
... i do n't think there 's anything else you can do			2
" how long did the juries of other major trials deliberate ?			0

@entity9 says lawyers for @entity6 's family wrongly " victimized " his client
one of those lawyers it was " wrong " @entity2 was n't arrested at first
first on @entity13 : @entity2 's life if acquitted ? " not a good one , " defense lawyer says
the defendant has been living " mostly in hiding , " adds @entity9
