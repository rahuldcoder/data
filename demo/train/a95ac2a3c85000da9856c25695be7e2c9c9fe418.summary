-- an @entity2 appeals court wednesday overturned hate - crime convictions of 16 @entity5 men and women in connection with a spate of beard - and hair - cutting attacks on members of their faith , according to court documents			1
the 6th @entity15 @entity14 in @entity16 found that the jury in the original case was given incorrect instructions on how to deliberate the role of religion in the attacks , the documents say			2
the leader of a breakaway @entity5 community , @entity25 , and 15 of his followers were found guilty in 2012 in connection with what authorities said were the religiously motivated attacks on several @entity5 people			1
@entity25 and others were convicted of conspiracy to violate a federal hate - crime law			2
prosecutors said @entity25 's followers , at his instruction , shaved the beards and cut the hair of @entity5 people who had left his group over various religious disagreements			1
five attacks happened in four eastern @entity2 counties between september and november 2011			0
" no one questions that the assaults occurred , and only a few defendants question their participation in them			0
the central issue at trial was whether the defendants committed the assaults ' because of ' the religion of the victims , " according to decision			0
two of the three judges on the appeals panel found that " when all is said and done , considerable evidence supported the defendants ' theory that interpersonal and intra-family disagreements , not the victims ' religious beliefs , sparked the attacks , " according to the documents			1
@entity25 was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the crimes			1
four of his followers were sentenced to seven years , three received five - year sentences , two were sentenced to two years and six were sentenced to a year and a day , according to the justice department			2
the jury also had convicted various defendants with separate assaults , and @entity25 with concealing or attempting to conceal evidence , including a camera and pictures of the attacks , the @entity15 attorney 's office said			2
those charges , which were not part of the appeal , still stand			0
it is unclear if any defendants will be released as a result of the overturned hate crime convictions			1
@entity15 attorney @entity88 released a statement following the decision			0
" we respectfully disagree with the two judges who reversed the defendants ' hate crime convictions based on a jury instruction , " the statement said			1
" we remain in awe of the courage of the victims in this case , who were subject to violent attacks by the defendants			0
we are reviewing the opinion and considering our options			0
" usually , the @entity5 resolve disputes without involving law enforcement , but some @entity5 members reported the beard - cutting incidents to police			1
@entity25 's group , which had broken away from a larger @entity5 community , is made up primarily of his relatives living on and around an 800 - acre compound in a remote valley outside @entity116 , @entity2			0
to the @entity5 , a beard is a significant symbol of faith and manhood , and the way @entity5 women wear their hair also is a symbol of faith			1
calls to defense attorney @entity128 by @entity0 were not immediately returned			0
@entity0 's @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .			0
