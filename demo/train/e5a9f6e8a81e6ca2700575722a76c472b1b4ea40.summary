-- the @entity1 on thursday voted unanimously to posthumously pardon @entity2 , the charismatic lead singer for @entity3 , four decades after @entity2 was convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity			1
outgoing @entity7 gov. @entity6 -- an admitted @entity3 fan -- proposed the official let - off for the late singer for a disputed incident during a @entity12 , @entity7 , concert			1
@entity2 's widow , @entity13 , who opposed the pardon , said she was not surprised at the outcome , given the fans who were supporting it			1
" since the original charges and trial were a publicity stunt to begin with , it does n't surprise me in the slightest that the pardon should follow in those footsteps , " she told @entity0			1
her husband " did nothing to be pardoned for " and his record should have been expunged , @entity13 said			0
@entity6 , who is set to leave office in january after losing his bid for the @entity29 in the recent midterm elections , said that after reviewing the case file , he felt compelled to get involved			0
" what i do know is that if someone has n't committed a crime , that should be recognized , " he said before the vote			0
" we live in a civil society that understands that lasting legacy of a human being , and maybe the last act for which they may be known , is something that never occurred in the first place , it 's never a bad idea to try to right a wrong			2
" the governor said the conviction should have been dismissed after @entity2 's death " so that he was again presumed innocent			1
" " a pardon corrects the fact that mr. @entity2 is now unable to take advantage of the presumption of innocence that is the cornerstone of the @entity57 criminal justice system , " @entity6 said in a statement after the vote			1
board member @entity58 , the state 's outgoing chief financial officer , said she spent the day wednesday listening to @entity3			1
@entity6 , @entity58 , attorney general @entity61 and agriculture commissioner @entity62 voted for the pardon			2
@entity2 had been performing with the band at a typically raucous concert at @entity12 's @entity66 on march 1 , 1969 , when the incident took place			1
reportedly drunk and slurring obscenities at the crowd , he was accused of unzipping his pants and simulating a sex act , a charge he denied			1
despite being acquitted of lascivious behavior and drunkenness , @entity2 was convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity and sentenced to six months in jail			1
he was still appealing the verdict in 1971 when he died in @entity80 of a heart attack at the age of 27			0
he would have turned 67 on wednesday			0
doors fans have long appealed for an official pardon for " the @entity2 , " petitioning previous @entity7 governors without success			1
many argue that the trial was a sham and that there was no conclusive evidence supporting the exposure charge against @entity2			1
" since last month , about 130 people have written in favor of the pardon , and 70 are opposed , " @entity6 spokesman @entity93 said			2
normally , @entity93 said , up to 15 letters per case are received			0
" it far exceeds the amount of input we usually have on clemency or pardon cases , " he said			1
" i just do n't think there is sufficient evidence in the file or on the record , no photos or video that would indicate that the alleged act occurred , " @entity6 said			0
" my heart bleeds for ( @entity2 ) and his family			1
" but @entity13 , author of the book " @entity115 : my life with and without @entity2 , " said he would reject such a pardon			1
" i think he would reject this completely out of hand , " she told @entity0			2
" he would just say , ' you know , no thanks			0
i ca n't be bothered			0
' " @entity13 was n't at the concert where the incident took place , but said by most accounts , evidence that @entity2 exposed himself was slim , although she acknowledged he was drunk at the time			1
she attended his trial , and " i saw a stack of photos that the prosecution was entering in as evidence			0
" the most compromising one , she said , " was him with his hand stuck down the front of his pants			0
" " despite the fact that there were 10,000 people in the hall that night , funny thing , no one has a picture of the actual exposure of the @entity2 's lizard , " said @entity13 , who currently writes rock and roll mystery novels			1
she calls the idea of a pardon silly , writing in a letter to @entity6 that @entity2 " would hate , loathe , detest and despise the whole idea			1
he would think it is yet another pathetic attempt by the @entity7 to use him for its own cheap and cynical publicity - hungry purposes , and i have no doubt but that he would rip the ' pardon ' into tiny pieces			1
" " he did n't do anything wrong , but he would n't want to be cleared , " she told @entity0			0
the late ' 60s and early ' 70s saw an evolving culture of drugs , hippies and rock - and - roll music that helped set a theme for that generation			2
" make love , not war " was a popular slogan			0
however , following @entity2 's arrest several days after the concert , a decency rally was staged at the @entity171			1
the trial took its toll on the singer , @entity13 said			2
he moved to @entity80 during the appeal			0
even today , @entity3 ' music remains popular			0
" he was light years ahead of his time , " @entity13 said of her husband			0
" which , i think , is why people still identify so strongly with his art and what he was trying to do			0
" but she said it 's hard for her to listen to the band			2
" i do n't listen , because i do n't want to be surprised by @entity2 when i 'm not really prepared to hear his voice , " she said			2
" it 's very painful			2
... that 's the voice that sings all those wonderful songs			2
but it 's also the voice that said all those really nice things into my ear			0
and that 's really hard to get around sometimes			0
