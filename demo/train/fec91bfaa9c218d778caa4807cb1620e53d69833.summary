-- allow me to introduce myself			2
i am a gainfully employed , @entity2 - fearing , law - abiding citizen , and i come in peace			2
i do n't bet on baseball , i take excellent care of my gums , i keep my tray table locked and upright from takeoff to landing			1
oh , and there 's one more thing : i am what is commonly referred to in polite society as " an unmarried woman			2
" truth be told , i now have a boyfriend and a baby girl -- it 's all very modern -- but much of my 30s involved ostensibly concerned bystanders averting their eyes , asking how many cats i own , and sharing their private theories on where it all went so hideously wrong for me			2
ah , yes , i remember it well			2
and when i start to forget , i still have plenty of single girlfriends in various states of angst to remind me of the grotesque fix - ups , the ham - handed remarks , and the brutal @entity33 dinners			1
for those valiant , traumatized souls , i present my list of the ten things one must never say , think , or do when dealing with a single woman over the age of 35			1
hey , cousin @entity41 , how ' bout we break with tradition and dispense with that bridal bouquet toss ? believe it or not , it 's actually a touch degrading to be shoved front and center next to your spinster aunt @entity49 from @entity51 as a roomful of revelers hopped up on @entity54 and jumbo shrimp chant , " you 're next , you 're next			1
the word picky -- as in " the reason you refuse to meet my podiatrist 's brother - in - law for a night of miniature golf is that you 're too picky " -- is not only offensive , it 's inaccurate			1
hell , i 'd have dated @entity64 if he were willing to meet in a well - lit , public place			0
no , i suspect it was your description of his " slight comb - over " and " profound desire to one day shake @entity71 's hand " that made me release that " catch " back into the wilds of @entity74			0
@entity0 : the number one thing to look for in a partner 3			0
do n't confuse being unmarried with being 11			1
my love of @entity79 - shaped macaroni and cheese notwithstanding , i never wanted to sit at the children 's table			0
nor did i want to ride in the backseat with your darling toddler , his pet tarantula , his @entity88 glitter glue , and his melting @entity89			0
kindly stop filling every conversational lull by announcing how much you love " @entity93			0
" being single is not the same thing as being gay , just as being married is not proof of being straight ... but i 'll cover that concept more fully in my upcoming " @entity98 " article			1
@entity0 : how to break the ice with anyone 5			0
has anybody out there noticed that the institution of matrimony is falling apart faster than @entity105 on a can of @entity107 ? now , i honestly do n't care if your marriage is so gothic in its dysfunction that it makes the couple from " who 's afraid of @entity114 ? " look like @entity115 and @entity116 -- i 'm not here to judge			1
all i ask is that you quit judging me			0
perhaps we 're not suffering a fear of intimacy as much as a fear of being trapped in a crummy marriage			1
remember that little factoid you used to bandy about -- you know , the one where 40 - year - old women have a greater chance of being shot by terrorists than of making it to the altar ? then you may also recall that @entity132 refuted that myth 14 years ago			1
so , okay , ms. @entity132 is probably rethinking that ( thanks a lot , @entity136 ! ) , but you do n't have to rub it in			1
enough with the " constructive " criticism already			2
we live in a world of stunning technological advancement , but it remains physically impossible to wear your heart on your sleeve and be emotionally distant , dress like a slut and a librarian , try much too hard and not make any real effort			0
new rule : you may discuss everything from @entity153 to the rise of @entity155 with your single friend			2
but her uterus , ovaries , entire reproductive system are off - limits			0
sending clippings about a 74 - year - old @entity164 woman who just gave birth to triplets along with a peppy little " keep hope alive ! " post-it note will do irreparable damage to your relationship and -- if the woman is particularly resourceful -- may even get your tires slashed			0
here 's a phrase that must never , ever cross your lips : " let me tell you why a terrific gal like you is still single ...			1
" because that terrific gal is then likely to explain in dark and visceral detail what happened to the last gentleman who uttered those very words -- and , trust me , you really do n't want to know			1
i 've looked at single life from both sides now , and here 's what i think : single women are not @entity188 in " @entity189 " any more than they 're @entity190 in " @entity191			1
" for one thing , very few have @entity193 in their closets			0
for another , very few have sex with @entity198 in their kitchens			0
they sometimes get lonely , frustrated , they sometimes get flat - out goofy			0
they are human beings -- tickle them and they laugh , prick them and they bleed , offer them chocolate and they eat ...			2
in other words , they 're pretty much like all the married women i know			1

*columnist* @entity207 says please do n't say these things to single women
*dangerous* to say , " let me tell you why a terrific gal like you is still single ... . "
do n't tell them they 're too picky for not wanting to date guy you 've described
do n't give them *constuctive* criticism or *insinuate* that they are gay
