-- a court in @entity2 has sentenced to death more than 500 supporters of the now - banned @entity5 following violence that broke out in the southern city of @entity8 last august			1
the @entity9 puts the number of those sentenced at 529			1
a single policeman was killed			2
only 147 of the defendants were reportedly in court monday			2
sixteen people were also acquitted at the hearing			2
another 683 defendants -- including the @entity5 's spiritual leader @entity17 -- appeared before the same judge tuesday in relation to the unrest			2
their case was adjourned until april 28			0
@entity0 spoke to its correspondent in @entity23 , @entity24 , independent @entity2 journalist @entity25 and @entity2 legal historian @entity26 about monday 's mass sentence			1
what happened in @entity8 ? a police officer was murdered during the @entity31 riots in @entity8 last august			1
the violence followed a deadly crackdown by security forces on two @entity23 sit - ins being held by supporters of former @entity38 president @entity37			1
@entity37 , @entity2 's first democratically elected president , had been toppled in a military coup in july 2013			1
defense lawyer @entity41 told @entity0 the charges against the defendants appearing tuesday include breaking into a police station , attempted murder , disturbing public peace and public order			0
the death sentence imposed on 529 people -- will it be carried out ? @entity24 said it was " highly unlikely " that all those sentenced to death would be executed			1
he said @entity2 had a large appeals process and the country 's chief @entity55 authority -- the grand mufti -- also had to approve the death sentences			1
many death sentences in @entity2 are later reduced , or overturned , @entity24 said			1
" when you hear something like this , well it is shocking , but you do have to step back and say there 's a lot between the sentencing and the execution			0
" @entity26 also said it was most likely the sentences would be appealed and revised			1
" with regard those on the run , they automatically have the right for an entire new trial , in addition to the right of appeal following the issuance of the sentence , " he said			0
@entity80 , a lawyer representing some of those sentenced to death , said that they would appeal the verdict after the @entity85 had made his decision allowing the court to announce its final ruling -- set for april 28			1
how was the trial conducted ? the @entity8 court has been criticized for taking just two sessions to reach its verdict against the 529 people convicted			1
" never before has a court issued such a large number of death sentences in such a short period of time -- only two sessions , " @entity26 said			1
the @entity2 news organization @entity99 said the court had issued its verdict " -- the biggest capital punishment verdict in the history of the @entity2 judiciary -- without hearing the defense arguments			1
" @entity41 told @entity0 his team of lawyers were n't allowed inside the courtroom			0
he said they did n't have any time to plead the case or review the evidence as the first procedural session was on saturday , before being postponed until monday -- when the verdict was issued			0
one defendant told @entity0 he had n't been summoned for questioning by the prosecution or by the court for the trial			2
the man , who requested anonymity , said he had n't been in @entity8 during the incident			2
the verdict was " unjust " he said and the accusations " invalid			0
" another defendant -- who also asked not to be named -- told @entity0 he had been at home during the violence			0
he said he believed he had been added to the list of defendants just because he was a member of the anti-coup alliance			0
ten members of the alliance had also died that day , he claimed , and no one had been held accountable			0
how does the sentence compare to others ? @entity26 said the court 's ruling made a " mockery of the entire @entity2 legal system			1
" " as a historian of the @entity2 legal system , i can confidently say that this court ruling is a travesty of justice , " he said			1
" never before in @entity2 's long history has there ever been a ruling so obscene in its contradiction of the very principles of justice			1
" @entity26 described the ruling as " particularly perverse " as it handed down death sentences against 529 defendants accused of killing a single police officer			1
journalist @entity156 said the sentence was " ridiculous and a grave injustice			0
" " ridiculous because it 's not possible that 529 people can murder a police officer -- which was one of the charges against the defendants			1
the other charge is less serious of course -- destruction of public property -- and does n't deserve a death sentence			0
" @entity156 said the judiciary was displaying double standards			0
she pointed to the death of @entity174 in 2010 , whose alleged brutal beating by security forces is said to have been one of the factors behind the 2011 revolution that led to the ousting of then - president @entity181			2
" the killer of @entity174 got a 10 - year prison sentence , " she said			0
meantime , @entity99 pointed to the sentencing of a police officer to 10 years imprisonment for the deaths of 37 islamists in a police van last year as a " sharply contrasting verdict			0
" how has the @entity2 public reacted to the verdicts ? @entity156 said the verdict had been received with shock			2
" the harsh sentence came as a big shock to me and many others including @entity2 's liberals , many of whom oppose the @entity5 , " said journalist @entity156			1
" @entity37 's supporters are calling it a ' death penalty for the judicial system in @entity2 ' , " she said			1
" you still find supporters of the military who say that they deserve it , these are terrorists			0
that 's because the country is extremely and deeply polarized and anyone seen to show sympathy -- even remotely -- for the @entity5 is labeled a traitor and accused of being one of them , " she said			0
@entity26 said he had little doubt that the ruling was politically motivated			0
" it is as if the judge wanted to appease the military rulers of the country who decided to wage a ' @entity223 ' and have declared the @entity5 a terrorist organization , " he said			0
@entity26 claimed the sentence had made " a mockery of the entire @entity2 legal system , " and in the process undermines a fundamental pillar of society -- the very principle that the regime is accusing the @entity5 of doing			2
" in other words , if there is anyone who is undermining the stability of the @entity2 state , it is the judiciary and its incessant desire to appease the military and the police , " he said			2
@entity156 said it was " clear that courts are being used to settle political scores			0
" " the courts are one more battleground for the political standoff between the military backed authorities and the @entity38 group , " she said			0
" so basically , the verdict is a threat to @entity5 supporters -- and also to opponents of the regime in general -- that there 's zero tolerance for dissent			0
" @entity24 said the verdict can be seen as part of the ongoing crackdown on the @entity5 and their supporters in which hundreds have died and thousands arrested			0
the irony , he said , is that while 529 people were sentenced to death over the killing of one police officer and attempted murder of another , no one has been held accountable for the deaths of hundreds of protesters			1
how has @entity2 's government responded ? @entity2 's government , through its foreign ministry , stressed the independence of the country 's judiciary in a statement to @entity0			1
" the @entity2 government would like to affirm that the @entity2 judiciary is entirely independent and is not influenced in any way by the executive branch of government , as dictated by the democratic principle of separation of powers , " the ministry said			2
the ministry pointed out that the @entity8 sentence had been issued by an independent court " after careful study of the case ; that it was only the first verdict in the trial process ; and that the defendants would be able to contest the verdict in the @entity299			1
" what about the @entity5 ? the @entity5 issued a statement saying the sentence " violates judicial norms			0
" " the shocking and unprecedented sentencing of 529 @entity5 supporters without due process is evidently inhumane and a clear violation of all norms of humane and legal justice , " it said in a statement on its website			0
" the verdict is yet another clear indication that the corrupt judiciary is being utilized by the coup commanders to suppress the @entity2 revolution and install a brutal regime which has already surpassed decades long of oppression and tyranny in @entity2 's history			1
" in december , @entity2 's interim government officially declared the @entity5 a terrorist organization			1
it said anyone who was a member would be punished , as would those found to be giving the group financial support			0
what 's happened to @entity37 ? @entity37 , the former head of the @entity5 's political arm , was elected president in 2012			0
shortly after winning , he resigned from the @entity5 and its @entity330 in an effort to show that he would represent all @entity2			2
but he was ousted in a coup in july 2013 amid widespread protests against his rule , with opponents accusing him of pursuing an @entity38 agenda and excluding other factions from the government			0
@entity37 and other @entity5 leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of counts , including organizing attacks on @entity2 troops in the @entity346 and fueling " sectarian sedition with the aim of igniting civil war in @entity2			2
" 529 sentenced to death in @entity2 @entity5 banned what is the @entity5 lawyers in @entity5 case seek new judges			1

on march 24 , an @entity2 court sentenced 529 people to death over violence in the city of @entity8
last august , a policeman was murdered in riots after a crackdown on @entity31 sit - ins
the sentences need to be approved by @entity2 's @entity85 and can be appealed
the length of the trial and *severity* of the sentences have *sparked* criticism
