-- the mayor of @entity2 , @entity3 , apologized wednesday for saying he would help @entity4 in his town by eating tacos , a remark that sparked anger from state officials and immigrant advocates already fuming over allegations of police mistreatment of @entity4 in his city			1
" my sincerest apologies go out to the @entity2 community and , in particular , the @entity20 community for the insensitive and off - color comment that i made to @entity23 reporter @entity22 yesterday regarding the recent events affecting our community and our police department , " mayor @entity15 said in a statement			1
" unfortunately , i let the stress of the situation get the best of me and inflamed what is already a serious and unfortunate situation			0
" he was referring to the arrests of four @entity2 police officers by @entity36 agents tuesday for their alleged roles in abusing @entity20 residents and business owners , performing illegal searches , making false arrests and harassing immigrant rights advocates			1
the arrests are the first to stem from a federal investigation into racial profiling in the city and follow a scathing december report from the @entity48 that accused the town 's police of engaging in " discriminatory policing against @entity4			0
" in the interview later tuesday , @entity22 pointed out that there were no @entity20 officers on the police force			1
" and your point being ? " @entity15 responded			2
when asked then what he planned to do for the @entity20 community in light of the discrimination allegations , the mayor said , " i might have tacos when i go home , i 'm not quite sure yet			1
" gov. @entity65 on wednesday slammed @entity15 's comment as " repugnant " and " unacceptable			1
" @entity67 said the remarks " represent either a horrible lack of judgment or worse , an underlying insensitivity to our latino community that is unacceptable			0
" " he owes an apology to the community , and more importantly , he needs to show what he 's going to do to repair the damage he 's done , " the governor said			0
" and he needs to do it today			0
" @entity82 mayor @entity81 added wednesday that he was " disgusted by mayor @entity15 's comment			1
" he said @entity15 's words suggested that the accusations of discrimination were " dismissed and disregarded			2
" " many have worked diligently to correct the painful history of racism in this country , and mayor @entity15 's comments are a disappointing example of how far we still have to go to , " said @entity81			1
@entity15 on tuesday called the arrests of the officers " unfortunate " and said his office " stands behind the @entity96			1
" following his apology a day later , @entity15 then asked the public to consider the difficulties the arrested officers and their families must be going through in the wake of the scandal			1
" it 's really a devastation to them , " he told @entity0			0
" it 's my apology to the communities out there ; whether they 're @entity20 or not is secondary to what our town is suffering and going through at this particular time			2
" @entity15 made no mention of any of the alleged @entity20 victims in the case			1
" what i apologized most to ( @entity23 reporter ) @entity22 was that i think i might have hurt him personally , and i can understand that , " the mayor added			0
" being of @entity124 descent , there 's been plenty of people that have said to me , ' oh you live in @entity2 , ' and we all know what that refers to			2
or , ' oh you 're @entity124 ; you must like meatballs and spaghetti			0
' we all know what that refers to			0
and sometimes i take those comments to heart , ( even ) when i realize sometimes there was nothing meant by them			0
" " i 've been talking since 6 o'clock yesterday morning , " @entity15 added , saying he had done more than a dozen interviews			2
he later claimed that his comment had been taken out of context			0
on tuesday , the mayor cautioned against the blaming police prematurely			2
" they 're innocent until proven guilty , " he said			0
@entity15 added that he does n't believe allegations of such systemic discrimination in @entity2 are accurate			1
" we have an open community here , " he said , speaking on behalf of the police department			0
however , @entity15 said his town " is prepared to do all that is necessary to address the consequences of ( the ) grand jury indictment			2
" still , many @entity20 residents of @entity2 say they 've for years had to contend with an overly aggressive police force			1
" they always come by and bother us , " said @entity159 , a manager at @entity160 , a @entity20 - owned bar and restaurant named in the indictment			1
" police come in two or three times a month and ask everyone in the restaurant for their identification , " he said			2
" and if you do n't have it , they threaten us and say they 're going to call the immigration office			0
" the effect , @entity159 said , has left many in the town 's @entity20 community fearful of @entity2 authorities			1
one incident occurred in @entity182 's parking lot on november 22 , 2008 , the indictment said , when officer @entity183 allegedly handcuffed an individual on false pretenses and threw him down onto the pavement , causing a " deep cut " to the man 's chin			0
@entity191 then allegedly kicked the man repeatedly , and later fabricated a false report to " conceal and cover - up his assault , " it said			0
others , such as @entity197 , an @entity2 hairdresser at @entity199 's salon , said he 's seen police harassing individuals just outside his salon			1
he called the mayor 's comments racist , and that while he accepts his apology , he said @entity15 ca n't easily be trusted			2
@entity2 resident @entity206 added that police have also commonly stopped her @entity20 friends for questioning			1
it " has to change , " she said			0
though tuesday 's arrests and @entity15 's errant comment have likely blemished the reputation of this @entity216 suburb , there have been changes since the @entity48 report , the mayor noted			1
an independent commission of community members , external consultants and former law enforcement officials has since been formed to adjust police patrol and complaint policies			0
the mayor cited a series of reforms , pointing to a revised @entity2 police handbook -- the first update since 1972			1
" it was an outdated book , " @entity15 said			2
according to 2010 census data , @entity2 has a population of some 29,000 people , with about 10.3 % identifying as @entity234 or @entity20			1
federal authorities , meanwhile , are asking the public for additional tips surrounding alleged discrimination and abuse , offering anonymity to those would - be tipsters concerned about their legal resident status			0
@entity0 's @entity243 and @entity244 in @entity2 , @entity3 contributed to this report			0
