@entity1 , @entity2 when @entity4 visits a cafe near the state @entity6 , he admires one man behind the counter			1
to him , @entity9 represents a life saved			1
@entity4 headed the @entity2 attorney general 's criminal division when his office accepted @entity9 's insanity plea in the 2008 killing of his brother			1
" i take some measure of satisfaction from the fact he 's a young man who has a future , " @entity4 says			2
" we had an opportunity to save him			1
unfortunately , the wheels of justice kicked in after a horrific tragedy			2
" there 's no punishment i can give @entity9 that 's worse than the punishment he gives himself whenever he thinks about his brother			1
" the former prosecutor and one - time @entity1 mayor was recently appointed a @entity34 judge			1
he sees @entity9 's recovery from multiple viewpoints			1
as a citizen , civic leader , head prosecutor and judge			1
@entity9 is one of 90 mentally ill people in @entity2 designated as not criminally responsible -- known as @entity43 patients -- because they were determined to be insane at the time of the crimes			1
@entity46 had faced murder charges			2
the rest were charged with an array of offenses , including aggravated assault , arson , stalking and sexual misconduct			2
" as a prosecutor , you ca n't be so rigid you reject the idea that there really are people who are truly insane , " @entity4 says			1
" the people i 'm worried about are not the forensics patients , because they 're getting the best treatment you can imagine			2
the people i 'm worried about are the people who are severely mentally ill not getting treatment			2
they 're the next case that i do n't want to see			1
" @entity9 was sent to the state psychiatric hospital with the goal of rehabilitation			1
he remained there for 4Â½ years and moved out of the hospital more than a year ago			2
now 29 , he lives alone in a supervised apartment in downtown @entity1			1
he tries not to dwell on the past			2
his brother was a year older ; the two had been inseparable growing up			1
they played @entity76 , lifted weights and shared that indescribable bond of brotherhood			2
" there 's just a connection i had with him that i just do n't have with anybody else , and nothing can replace it , " @entity9 says			1
" @entity86 really was my best friend			2
that might be hard to believe with what happened			2
" the past is very hard to work through			2
" the biggest aid in his recovery , he says , was the forgiveness of his six other siblings and his mother , who remains his greatest advocate			2
" you do n't give up on one of your sons , " says @entity97 , his mother			1
" @entity86 was devastating and still is			0
part of me is broken			0
but @entity9 is here and he still needs us			1
so our focus is on him			0
" focus on rehabilitation @entity2 's @entity43 statute says that a defendant is not criminally responsible by reason of insanity " if , at the time of the criminal conduct , as a result of mental disease or defect , the defendant lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the criminal conduct			1
" each defendant undergoes rigorous psychiatric assessment			0
about 5 % of the state 's cases result in a person being found not criminally responsible			1
" once that decision is made , the focus shifts from punishment to rehabilitation , treatment and public safety , " @entity4 says			0
the length of a stay depends on how a patient responds to treatment			0
that can range from a couple of years to decades			0
typically , the younger the patient is on arrival , officials say , the better likelihood of a quicker recovery			0
the program has been in place for more than 50 years , but was revamped after an @entity43 patient on a four - hour leave in 1985 killed a teenage girl			1
stricter laws govern today 's treatment program			1
that case also led to creation of the @entity153 , which conducts psychiatric and psychological evaluations for the court system			0
in the three decades since , state officials say , no @entity43 patient has committed a violent felony upon return to the community			1
" the history of the experience speaks volumes , " says @entity161 , commissioner of @entity2 's @entity162			1
" we do n't have an experience of recidivism			1
... we 're focused on recovery and the evidence - based standards of care			0
the assessments and progress are comprehensive and are consistently being evaluated			0
" patients who once refused treatment , who could hardly utter a coherent sentence , begin to surrender to therapy , start taking medication and over time become functional			0
the treatment plan is based on incremental freedoms and stringent rules			0
as they progress , they can petition the court to move into a group home after years of therapy , then to a supervised apartment			0
eventually , they can seek full release , as happened recently with a mother who starved her 5 - year - old daughter to death in 1993			0
other states have similar programs , but the approach and aggressiveness of the releases vary			0
while @entity2 has shown success in rehabilitating its patients , other states have n't fared so well			1
dr. @entity204 , a research psychiatrist , best - selling author and founder of the @entity206 , has been tracking patients who killed again upon their release into the community			1
" there is no shortage of them , " he says			0
once patients have undergone treatment , @entity204 says , " it is imperative to then guarantee to the community , as well as to the person , that this individual will remain on medication indefinitely			1
and that 's the issue			0
" states have an incentive to move patients into the community and out of the hospital quickly , @entity204 says , because the federal government picks up the cost when patients live in the community			1
and that , @entity204 says , has resulted with patients being let go too soon and with drastic consequences			0
@entity232 , director of @entity2 's @entity153 , says authorities work extremely hard to make sure that does n't happen			1
" what we know from years of research , " she says , " if people make that transition too soon , they tend to have multiple offenses , dangerous behavior			0
so we go very slowly through that process			0
" she often faces heated questions , even among friends and family , about why the state allows mentally ill patients , especially those who have killed , back into the community			1
she tells them : " that mental illness is treated and stable , and that they 've had years to work hard and demonstrate that stability			0
" " it 's a slow , stepwise process , " @entity232 says			0
" we keep an eye out for the safety of the community , and the hospital makes proposals based on what the patient wants or needs			2
" since 2001 , when @entity4 took over the @entity2 attorney general 's criminal division , 12 people have been deemed not criminally responsible in murder cases			1
most killed a family member or somebody close to them			0
five others who sought @entity43 status were rejected at trial and sentenced to prison			0
" there 's always that concern that someone is gaming the system -- that someone is pretending to be insane when they 're not in order to avoid criminal responsibility , " @entity4 says			2
" we 're very conscious of that			0
" yet officials acknowledge there is no crystal ball , no way to predict how a patient will react upon release			0
the question they face most from an astonished public is : how do you know they wo n't kill again ? " there are no guarantees , " says @entity232 , " and oftentimes i think the community is looking for a guarantee when we ca n't provide that about anybody			1
" what we can say is these people that are under the commissioner 's custody get the best care ; they get the care that they need ; they get the supervision they need so they can have a life			2
" @entity9 has begun his new life , but there are hitches			1
every time he seeks more freedom , he must appear before court			0
that results in a local headline like : " @entity2 man who fatally stabbed brother can move to apartment , judge says			1
" he says local reporters never ask to speak with him , never seek his side of the story			0
his mom wishes they 'd stop running his arraignment photograph in which he was 150 pounds , in psychosis and looks totally out of it			0
if they 'd just ask to take a new photo , his mother would be happy			0
" it sets up people to be afraid of me , " @entity9 says			1
the cafe where he works has accepted him and remains supportive			0
making @entity334 sandwiches is n't his ultimate goal			2
with a hulking 220 - pound frame , @entity9 hopes to become a fitness instructor one day			1
he can bench - press 425 pounds			0
residents have no reason to fear him , he says			0
" the people who have had treatment , like myself , are not the ones that they need to worry about			0
myself specifically , i 'm aware of my illness , " he says			0
" i 'm aware of the fact that i need to take meds to remain stable or i need to watch how i 'm thinking and manage my thoughts			0
" he 's determined to make his late brother proud of his recovery			2
" part of the reason i do n't give up on myself , " he says , " is i know that my brother would n't want that			1
i know he 'd want me to honor his memory in whatever way i can			0
every day that i live and get up , i do n't take it for granted because i know he does n't have that now			2

@entity2 program aims to rehabilitate those deemed insane , not criminally responsible
@entity9 now lives in the community after killing his brother in 2008
" we had an opportunity to save him , " *ex-head* prosecutor says
@entity2 health commissioner : " we do n't have an experience of recidivism "
