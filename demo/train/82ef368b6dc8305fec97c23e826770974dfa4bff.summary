he 's also known for his brilliant grasp of global economics and @entity10 politics			2
but for @entity11 -- head of the powerful @entity12 and , until this weekend , presumptive front - runner for the presidency of @entity15 -- the most relevant issue today may be whether he can stay out of prison			1

in @entity15 , it delivered what the @entity34 newspaper @entity47 called a " thunderclap " to the presidential race			2
and some at the headquarters of @entity11 's @entity36 were in tears monday after the news			1
arrest rocks @entity15 presidential race the incident has also disrupted the rhythm of the @entity12 , which assists countries suffering economic difficulties by providing loans			1
founded after @entity61 , the @entity12 is composed of 187 countries			1
politically , " it 's over			2
he 's done , " said @entity66 , a senior @entity10 analyst at the @entity67 , a @entity65 think tank			2
@entity11 " can not recover , " @entity66 told @entity0			1
it is , by any standard , a stunning fall for the man many presumed would be the next occupant of the @entity73			0
it 's also a cautionary tale for those who might forget how quickly sexual allegations can bring down even the most influential leaders			0
long before he ended up on the front pages of the tabloids , @entity11 was well - known to followers of global financial news			1
the @entity83 - educated economist has headed the @entity12 for the duration of the current global financial crisis			1
in doing so , he has played a lead role in bailing out the economies of @entity88 and @entity89 , as well as propping up @entity10 's currency , the euro			0
" he was a strong and effective leader , " said @entity92 , a health policy research analyst at the @entity94 at @entity95			0
" he made the @entity12 not only effective , but credible			1
" @entity11 has been a force in @entity15 politics for a quarter century , first winning election to that country 's @entity99 -- the lower house of parliament -- in 1986			1

" he is a very serious political figure as well as a senior economic and financial figure , " noted @entity119 , director of the @entity67 ' @entity10 program			0
he " understands what needs to be done in terms of economics and what can be done in terms of politics , " @entity66 said			0
a dominant figure in the @entity15 left , @entity11 gained a reputation over the years as someone who enjoys a lavish lifestyle			1
it was well - known that he is " not alien or indifferent to money , " @entity66 said			0
he has " been interested in his earnings			0
" in 1999 , after an allegation of unethical financial doings involving his consulting business , @entity11 resigned his ministerial post			1

to the extent that there was a perceived conflict between his socialist political ideals and wealthy lifestyle , it was n't an issue for most @entity15 voters , @entity66 asserted			0
it is @entity11 's sexual reputation that is more relevant today			1
long before he found himself in legal trouble in the @entity161 , there was " no question " that he " had a marked interest in the other sex , " @entity66 said			0
@entity11 's history of misconduct charges political analysts routinely note that allegations of infidelity are generally much less likely to derail a political career in @entity15 than in @entity161			1
there is simply a " different cultural context in @entity15 " to most sexual issues , @entity171 noted			0

he acknowledged reports that he 'd had an improper physical relationship with a female employee			0
the relationship was consensual , an independent inquiry found			0
the @entity12 's executive board concluded in october 2008 that " there was no harassment , favoritism or any other abuse of authority by the managing director			1
" nevertheless , the board found " that the incident was regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment , " the @entity12 said in a written statement			1
@entity11 issued a statement after the investigation , noting that he had " apologized for it to the ( board of directors ) , to the staff of the @entity12 and to my family , " as well as to the employee			1
@entity11 's departure from the @entity12 would not leave a huge void , said @entity203 , a senior fellow in the @entity204 at the @entity206 , a @entity65 - based think thank			1

" @entity203 said @entity11 liked to be known by his initials -- as @entity11			1
" ever since @entity213 , which is the airport , ironically , at which he was arrested , @entity15 politicians and even intellectuals have loved to try to establish themselves with a three - initial moniker because it has that sort of ring of prestige			0
" he cited the philosopher @entity221 , or @entity221 , as an example			0
what is surprising to many observers is the new assertion that @entity11 -- a man with no criminal record -- physically forced himself on a woman			2
" like all @entity15 , i was stupefied , " said @entity228 , who has written a biography of @entity230			0
" @entity228 , who recounted @entity230 's amorous adventures in his book , described the economist as " a @entity15 lover ... a great seducer			2
" but the man he studied " could not be a rapist , " @entity228 said			0
" imagine that that man , who is an extremely intelligent man , who is a great economist , who is a very nice man in his personal comportment , who is a father of a family , who is a grandfather , " @entity228 told @entity0			2
" i ca n't believe that he could be sexually aggressive against a young woman as he is accused of doing in @entity21			0
" yet , other charges against @entity11 are now surfacing in the wake of his arrest			2
@entity245 , a @entity36 member of the @entity15 parliament , said monday that @entity11 attacked her daughter in 2002			1

at the time , @entity251 was an aspiring journalist			0
@entity0 does not typically name assault victims , but @entity245 said her daughter gave permission for her name to be disclosed			0
however , in light of the charges filed against @entity11 in the wake of the alleged incident in @entity21 , @entity251 's attorney in @entity15 , @entity264 , has said he and the young woman are considering whether to file a complaint			2
regardless , @entity11 has a number of defenders			2
some supporters are grumbling about the incident in @entity21 allegedly being a political " set - up			0
" @entity11 's attorney , @entity271 , insists his client will " quite likely " be exonerated			2
while most @entity161 likely had n't heard of @entity11 before this past weekend , his fall may prove to be of interest for reasons beyond the obvious			2
at the time of @entity11 's arrest , the @entity12 was preparing for a critical meeting relating to a bailout for @entity280 , an extension of the @entity88 bailout , and the selection of a new @entity285 head , @entity171 noted			1

@entity161 banks hold $ 1.4 trillion in @entity10 debt			0

" we need to care about this issue			0
" @entity0 's @entity299 and @entity300 contributed to this report			0
