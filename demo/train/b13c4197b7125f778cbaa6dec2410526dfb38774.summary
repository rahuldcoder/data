@entity0 -- @entity3 defense minister @entity2 traveled to @entity0 last week expecting to see top @entity5 administration officials			1
instead , he found himself with a lot of time on his hands			0
the @entity9 denied him meetings with vice president @entity11 , secretary of state @entity12 and national security adviser @entity13			2
senior administration officials attributed the snub to numerous negative comments @entity17 made earlier this year criticizing the administration in general and @entity12 in particular			0
" it should n't have been a surprise given some of his comments , " a senior administration official said about @entity2 's visit			0
" we give you $ 1.3 billion of aid and you are dumping on us			0
none of our friends have been disrespectful to the extent of @entity3			2
" he was granted meetings with defense secretary @entity34 and @entity35 , the @entity37 ambassador to the @entity38			2
still , the episode offers a startling illustration of how badly relations have deteriorated between the @entity37 and @entity3 -- long - term allies -- because of irritation with @entity17			1
it also reflects years of pent - up frustration in the @entity9 over @entity3 's role in the @entity48 peace process			1
in january , the @entity5 administration -- and indeed many of @entity51 's fellow @entity3 politicians -- were apoplectic when he was quoted in @entity3 media calling @entity12 " obsessive and messianic , " in his efforts to forge a peace deal between @entity3 and @entity55			1
@entity2 added he hoped @entity12 " gets a @entity56 and leaves us alone			0
" @entity2 apologized after protests by @entity0 and a strong rebuke from prime minister @entity60			2
but tensions grew again in march , when @entity2 harshly criticized the way the @entity5 administration was dealing with @entity64 , saying the president was trying to leave the issue for his successor to deal with			2
@entity68 , an advisor to former @entity37 peace envoy @entity70 who now works at the @entity71 , said that while he does not believe @entity3 is currently trying to accentuate its differences with the @entity37 , the resentments on both sides are bubbling over			1
" it 's an accumulation of baggage that each side has carried for some time , " @entity68 said " what i see is the wear and tear of these six years working together where the sum of the problems becomes greater than the parts on policy			0
" in addition to the public dissing of @entity12 , who spent the better part of a year in a failed effort to broker a framework agreement between @entity3 and @entity55 , officials said @entity3 's inflexibility on security arrangements proposed for the plan by general @entity95 further aggravated the already strained ties			1
but the biggest culprit , the officials said , is continued @entity3 settlement construction in defiance of continued @entity37 objections			1
@entity0 has warned @entity3 against such unilateral moves that could prejudice the outcome of a future peace deal			1
the row over settlements turned ugly last month after @entity60 left @entity0 amid news of settlement expansion in the @entity108			2
when the prime minister said that @entity37 objections to @entity3 settlement activity went against @entity37 values , the @entity9 slapped him down , calling the criticism " odd			1
" " it 's clear how @entity37 values dictate or at least guide our thinking , " @entity9 spokesman @entity114 said			1
on monday , @entity60 announced @entity3 would fast - track planning for more than 1,000 new apartments in @entity119 , prompting swift and strong condemnation from the @entity121 , which said it was " deeply concerned " by the announcement			2
" if @entity3 wants to live in a peaceful society , they need to take steps that will reduce tensions , " said @entity121 spokesperson @entity123			0
" moving forward with this sort of action would be incompatible with the pursuit of peace			0
" in a phone call this weekend , @entity12 warned @entity60 against going ahead with the planned settlement units			0
he also pressed the prime minister to speed up an investigation of last week 's killing of a @entity55 @entity37 teen by @entity3 forces			1
" he told him it ca n't be business as usual where these things drag on and then do n't say anything , " one @entity37 official said			0
several @entity37 officials said a growing frustration with @entity3 on a host of issues has prompted a discussion within the administration about how to best to express it " we are in the process of re-evaluating exactly that question , " one senior administration official said , adding " various options are being drafted			1
" the tension comes as several important decision points related to @entity3 are coming to a head			0
the @entity37 must decide how it will respond to @entity55 president @entity159 's proposal to the @entity38 to declare a @entity55 state , something @entity3 is adamantly opposed to but an idea that has growing support in @entity164			1
@entity0 must also weigh how much effort to expend on dissuading its @entity164 allies from taking tougher measures against @entity3 such as boycotting products made in settlements or sanctioning @entity3 companies that do business in what is considered occupied territory			1
" there is a ton the @entity37 does behind the scenes , " another senior administration official said			0
" we bail them out of everything - pushing back the @entity164 , pushing back at the @entity38			0
we are their last good friend in the world			0
" the officials , who all spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak with candor , stressed that the @entity37 remains fully committed to @entity3 's security and all policy decisions are made from that starting point			1
but they add that the unequivocal political support the @entity37 expends to @entity3 may not always be a given			2
" we will never , ever stop funding for @entity194 or withhold anything that is related in any way to their security , but the question is , how much do we continue to do politically ? " an official said			0
" it is easy to do less on that front while making sure it does n't impact our security relationship			0

the @entity9 snubbed the @entity3 defense minister when he traveled to @entity0
relations with @entity3 have deteriorated as @entity37 try to broker with @entity55 and engage in *nuclear* talks with @entity64
