-- photos of @entity3 soldiers posing with bodies of suspected @entity6 insurgents , published wednesday by the @entity7 , depict behavior that " absolutely violates " @entity3 regulations and values , defense secretary @entity9 said wednesday			1
" this is not who we are , and it 's certainly not who we represent when it comes to the great majority of men and women in uniform who are serving there , " he said			2
the two photos published by the paper are among 18 provided by a @entity3 soldier who wanted " to draw attention to the safety risk of a breakdown in leadership and discipline , " the @entity7 reported			1
the military said an investigation is under way			1
@entity35 secretary - general @entity34 said the images " do n't in anyway represent the principles and values that are the basis for our mission in @entity6			1
" he added that he considers the photos " an isolated event			1
" the photos , from incidents in 2010 , represent " a serious error in judgment by several soldiers who have acted out of ignorance and unfamiliarity with @entity53 values , " @entity35 's @entity44 said in a statement			1
gen. @entity55 , the @entity44 commander , also condemned the photos			1
one shows a member of the @entity3 military in front of what appears to be the body of an insurgent			1
the photo shows the insurgent 's head , with his eyes open and what may be his hand on the @entity3 soldier 's shoulder			0
another soldier appears to be looking down at the body , reaching his hand into the blanket covering it			0
" a soldier from the @entity53 's @entity76 with the body of an @entity6 insurgent killed while trying to plant a roadside bomb , " the caption reads			0

one @entity3 soldier is smiling and giving a double thumbs - up , and another is also smiling at the camera			2
there appear to be @entity6 police in that photo as well			0
the paper says the photo was from 2010 , when the division arrived at a police station in @entity102 province and inspected body parts			0
" then the mission turned macabre : the paratroopers posed for photos next to @entity6 police , grinning while some held -- and others squatted beside -- the corpse 's severed legs			2
" @entity0 has not authenticated the images			0
@entity111 , spokeswoman for the @entity7 , said , " we verified the authenticity of the photos through interviews with the soldier who provided the photos , with @entity119 officials and with commanders from the unit			1
" " an investigation that could lead to disciplinary measures is under way , " @entity119 spokesman @entity122 said			2
" anyone found responsible for this inhuman conduct will be held accountable in accordance with our military justice system			2
" the @entity130 say the remains of the dead in a conflict " shall be respected			0
" @entity9 said he had called on the @entity7 not to publish the photos because the enemy uses these kinds of images to incite violence			1
lives have been lost because of publication of similar images in the past , he said			0
" this is war , and i know that war is ugly , and it 's violent , " @entity9 said at a @entity35 meeting in @entity143 , @entity144			1
" and i know that young people , sometimes caught up in the moment , make some very foolish decisions			0
i 'm not excusing them , not excusing that behavior			0
but neither do i want these images to bring further injury to our people or to our relationship with the @entity6 people			0
" earlier , @entity122 said @entity3 forces were taking security measures to guard against potential violence			0
in the article , times editor @entity161 said , " after careful consideration , we decided that publishing a small but representative selection of the photos would fulfill our obligation to readers to report vigorously and impartially on all aspects of the @entity3 mission in @entity6 , including the allegation that the images reflect a breakdown in unit discipline that was endangering @entity3 troops			1
" the soldier who provided the photos served in @entity6 with the @entity76 's 4th @entity178 from @entity179 , @entity180 , the @entity7 reported			1
" he said the photos point to a breakdown in leadership and discipline that he believed compromised the safety of the troops			1
" " he expressed the hope that publication would help ensure that alleged security shortcomings at two @entity3 bases in @entity6 in 2010 were not repeated , " the paper said			0
the soldier and two other former members of the battalion " said in separate interviews that they and others had complained of inadequate security at the two bases			0
" the commander of the @entity204 at the time the photos were taken and the then - commander of the @entity206 said they were not authorized to comment , the paper reported			1

one , now serving in @entity6 , declined to comment			0
the others did not respond			0
" lt. col. @entity219 , an @entity44 spokesman , said @entity81 told military officials about the photos in march , triggering an investigation			1
@entity219 did not say where the photos were taken or how many people are under investigation			1
" such actions are morally repugnant , dishonor the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of @entity3 soldiers and civilians who have served with distinction in @entity6 , and do not represent the core values of the @entity3 or our military , " the @entity3 @entity226 in @entity227 said			2
@entity3 sen. @entity236 , @entity237 , who served in @entity238 and was a prisoner of war , said the photos do not represent the behavior of the majority of @entity3 troops			1
" what bothers me the most is 99.9 % of these @entity246 that are serving over there have the highest standards , " he said wednesday , when asked about the photos			1
" i 've seen with my own eyes the thousands of acts of kindness and generosity that our men and women of the military show to the @entity6 people			2
i 've seen the partnerships , relationships , friendships , and all of that , of course , is tarnished so badly by a story such as what you 're talking about			0
" in describing one photo not shown in the newspaper , the @entity7 said two soldiers held a dead man 's hand with the middle finger raised			1
" a soldier leaned over the bearded corpse while clutching the man 's hand			0
someone placed an unofficial platoon patch reading ' @entity278 ' next to other remains and took a picture			0
" the @entity7 article notes that virtually all the men in the photos " had friends who were killed or wounded by homemade bombs or suicide attacks , according to the soldier who provided the images			1
" @entity34 said " such very unfortunate incidents do not in any way define our relationship with the @entity6 people and our relationship with the @entity6 security forces			0
" the @entity295 condemned the photos , saying what they show is typical of what the @entity3 stands for			2
" in the last 11 years since the @entity246 invaded @entity6 , they have repeatedly done inhumane things which are not acceptable to anyone in the world , " the @entity295 said in statement released thursday			0
it is the latest in a string of incidents that have plagued the @entity3 military in @entity6 this year			2
in january , a video posted on a website showed four @entity3 @entity310 urinating on enemy corpses			0
a month later , @entity44 personnel at @entity313 improperly disposed of @entity315 religious materials , including @entity316 , by burning them in what @entity3 officials described as an unintentional error			0
and @entity53 staff sgt. @entity321 allegedly left a remote outpost in @entity325 's @entity324 district in march and went house - to - house , gunning down villagers			2
he has been charged with 17 murders in the shooting rampage			0
perhaps the most notorious incident involving photos of @entity3 troops over the past decade took place in @entity335 in 2004			1
