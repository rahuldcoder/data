@entity0 , @entity1 -- two men circle warily in the center of a colorful gym mat. @entity6 holds a three - foot long wicker stick in one hand and a blunted aluminum knife in the other			1
a sudden rush and surge of adrenalin			1
both are engaged in a swirl of weapons			1
the air rings to the sound of sticks striking each other and the duller whomp of sticks striking legs , arms and torsos			1
the battle is engaged at full speed and full power			2
when the grueling two - minute bout is over , both combatants display an angry array of bumps , bruises and welts			2
the fighters embrace and depart the battlefield			2
neither has been declared the winner or the loser			2
the idea of winning or losing is not what the @entity42 are about			1
" we do n't keep score , " says @entity44 , one of the @entity42 ' founders			1
" no judges , no referees , no trophies			2
that would be contrary to the way we do things			2
" in 1988 , @entity44 and 10 other martial arts enthusiasts formed the loose tribe they called the @entity42			1
they were all drawn to an obscure form of the combat arts that originated during times of tribal warfare in the @entity62			1
this form of combat is primarily hand to hand using weapons that were available in the forests and jungles of the @entity62			1
it is a fighting discipline known in different parts of the world as @entity72 , @entity72 or @entity72			1
" in the past it had been a very , very secretive art , " @entity44 said , " a weaponry art that originated in tribal warfare in the jungles			1
" @entity42 gatherings feature bouts of stick fighting , knife fighting , fighting staffs , even the occasional use of chains and other weapons			1
punching , kicking and wrestling also come into play			2
combatants wear a fencing mask to protect the eyes and gloves to protect hands , but there is no other padding			2
their motto is , " higher consciousness through harder contact			2
" " there was definitely a part of me that said , these guys are way out there , " @entity97 " @entity96 said with a laugh			2
at the same time , @entity96 found the @entity42 ' form of extreme martial arts exciting			1
" they were applying it in real time and real speed and real power , " @entity96 said			2
" a part of myself said , i really want to do this			2
i want to test myself at this level			0
" there are perhaps 200 full - fledged members of the @entity42 pack			1
members receive a " dog " nickname after they are voted into the pack			1
the nickname is meant to describe each member 's fighting style or personality			1
however , to become a full member , other members must reach a consensus that the individual has developed his skills and represents his true potential as a martial artist			1
there are many who have more than a passing interest in the extreme form of martial arts the group represents			1
that is what attracted @entity137 to a recent @entity42 gathering in @entity0			1
@entity137 is a 39 - year - old political science professor from @entity140 's @entity139			0
he is a studious looking guy with a scraggly goatee and more than a few extra pounds			0
although he had trained for eight years in martial arts , @entity137 had never engaged in this kind of all - out combat			1
" it 's really scary , " @entity137 confessed before his bout , " i was trying to untie my shoes and i could n't			0
" @entity137 's bout lasted two minutes			0
he had been paired with a much more experienced fighter who took care to look after the newcomer 's safety			0
even so , the professor emerged with a series of welts on his arm and back , a bleeding knot on his forehead and at least one broken finger			0
the injuries did not dampen his spirits			0
" once you get into the ring it 's all good , " @entity137 said			0
" i 'm in the moment			0
i was in the moment			0
" to @entity169 , the idea is to push your fellow members to be their best but to also know when to stop			1
" in a fight of this nature , things can go wrong too quickly to count on a referee to jump into it			0
and so fighters are within the code of the tribe , " @entity44 said			0
" we could make this a padded pillow fight but then it would lose its meaning			0
the danger and risk are necessary to the transformative nature of the experience			0
" @entity44 said he realizes this form of fighting involves a concept that is not for everyone			1
he said it 's not something everybody understands			0
@entity96 certainly understands the calm that can exist at the center of a storm			0
" it 's never malicious			0
and people who display that kind of temperament are very quickly weeded out , " he said			0
" i 'm completely aware of everything that is going on			0
nothing beyond the exact moment exists			0
" @entity96 laughed at the suggestion that it is a moment of @entity207 , with an added element of pain			0
" a lot of pain if you find yourself a little too @entity207 and not paying attention to your opponent 's stick , " he said			1
whatever the attraction is to this form of extreme fighting , @entity44 said safety is still paramount			1
" the underlying rule is to be friends at the end of the day , " @entity44 said			0
" which means that our goal is that no one spends the night in the hospital			0
our goal is that everyone leaves with the iq that they came with			0
