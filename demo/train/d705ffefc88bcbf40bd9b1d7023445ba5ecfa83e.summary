-- a mother and her young son were at a mall , when she considered buying him a sandwich			0
she knew her husband would beat her later for spending the $ 7 , but her son was hungry			0
she swallowed her fear and bought the sandwich			0
i met a college professor with a phd who told me that her husband took her paycheck every month and that she had to wear long sleeves in the summer to hide the bruises on her arms			0
when a person tells you these very personal , gut - wrenching stories , you ca n't help but be moved to act			1
still , many people hear these stories and they ask , " why does she stay ? " i 've learned that getting away is never easy			2
there are children to consider			0
emotional ties are hard to break			0
oftentimes women simply do n't have the money because money is a weapon of choice for many domestic violence perpetrators			1
the @entity30 reports that financial abuse almost always accompanies physical abuse and can be the primary obstacle to women breaking free from bondage			2
it works like this : a man ( women are the victims in 85 % of cases ) sets up a credit card in the woman 's name and does n't pay the bills , ruining the woman 's credit			1
the man forces the woman to put her paycheck into a bank account and wo n't give her access			2
he hides all financial documents and wo n't share passwords for websites			0
so , the woman often has no money , poor credit , and a limited understanding of her financial situation			1
even if she is desperate to leave an abusive partner and has the courage to move to a local domestic violence shelter , she has no money for transportation , food or clothing			1
so , the right question is n't : " why does she stay ? " the right question is : " how can we help her get safe and secure ? " evidence shows that arming victims with the right tools and information can help			1
victims need to protect and reclaim their financial resources , rebuild their credit and gain a complete understanding of their financial picture			1
according to a long - term study by @entity80 and children at @entity82 , abused women who participated in a financial education curriculum developed by @entity85 and the @entity30 were twice as likely to take the financial steps necessary to rebuild their lives			0
the sheer scope of domestic violence overall in this country almost defies belief			1
data from the @entity93 shows that one in four women will be a victim of domestic abuse in their lifetime			2
the @entity93 also reports that 2 million women are injured in the @entity100 every year and that domestic abuse leads to 8 million lost days of work annually			2
polling by the @entity85 has shown that almost three quarters of us know a victim , even though few of us realize it			0
the @entity100 @entity107 has stated that approximately 1,300 die annually from domestic violence			1
the @entity109 argues that it is the no. 1 cause of homelessness for women , and the violence scars millions of children each year who witness it			2
yet , few want to talk about it because it is a dark and ugly subject			0
the @entity120 has given us all an opportunity to have deeper conversations about domestic violence			1
but it should n't take a high - profile incident in the news for us to rise up and take a stand against domestic violence			1
we must seize the opportunity to bring domestic violence and financial abuse out of the shadows and help women trapped in abusive relationships find the path to safety			1
business needs to take domestic violence very seriously			1
we need more businesses to step up and play an active role in protecting women			0
wherever possible , businesses should take into account extenuating circumstances such as domestic violence when considering credit histories and ratings			1
companies should make sure employee benefit plans provide a helping hand when needed			0
managers should be trained on how best to identify and support employees who are victims of abuse at home			0
in addition , all of us can rise up , including role models in sports and entertainment , academia , educators and concerned citizens			0
only by pulling back the curtain and getting involved can we ensure that victims can escape to a safer and brighter future			2
join us on @entity169 / @entity168 .			0
