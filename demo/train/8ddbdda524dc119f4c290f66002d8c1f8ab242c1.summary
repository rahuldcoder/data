-- if @entity2 could make three wishes , he would probably ask for the crisis in @entity5 to go away			1
that would help him receive another wish : getting reelected as president of the @entity9			1
unfortunately for @entity2 , and tragically for the people in @entity5 , history has brought the @entity9 presidential campaign and the @entity5 revolution to the same pages of the calendar			1
that means @entity2 will do whatever he can , for as long as he can , to keep the carnage in @entity5 from interfering with his reelection plan			1
that means the killings in @entity5 could go on longer than if the uprising had erupted during a nonelection year			1
anyone who doubts that electoral considerations have become a major factor in @entity9 foreign policy should look to @entity2 's own words from a few months ago			1
@entity2 did not realize his microphone was on during a meeting in @entity30 with then - @entity32 president @entity31 , so he leaned in close and whispered , " this is my last election			2
after my election i have more flexibility			0
" in this instance , @entity2 was referring to the contentious issue of missile defense			2
it 's not uncommon for presidents to worry about reelection while charting foreign policy			1
in @entity44 's new biography of president @entity45 , " @entity50 , " he describes how @entity45 made decisions about @entity47 with an eye towards the elections			0
@entity44 concluded that " the steps he took had , as their unifying principle , an objective dictated largely by domestic â € ” indeed , personal â € ” political concerns			0
" with less than five months until november , the last thing @entity2 needed on his already very full plate is another shockingly cruel , politically complicated conflict in the @entity60 , complete with gruesome , heartrending images , a recalcitrant dictator , and prominent voices calling on @entity64 to do something			1
photos : in @entity5 , families flee and rebels fight you ca n't put history on hold until after @entity72 , but you can certainly try			1
the @entity2 administration has put other major foreign policy issues on the back burner in order to avoid giving @entity77 fodder for criticism , to prevent new risks to the economy , or simply to avoid stepping on a landmine while moving along a dangerous global landscape			1
a report in @entity86 's @entity85 claims that the @entity87 asked @entity88 to delay an attack on @entity90 until after november			0
many fear that a war with @entity90 would send oil prices skyrocketing and hurt @entity2 's reelection prospects			1
although that scenario could be averted , the risk of armed conflict creates too much uncertainty during a pivotal year			0
for now , @entity2 and the @entity99 are backing slow - motion talks with @entity90 along with economic sanctions			2
they have significantly reduced their demands from a requirement that @entity90 stop enriching uranium to a call for @entity107 to " curb " enrichment to higher grades			0
elsewhere in the @entity60 , a top @entity111 leader said the @entity2 administration told @entity111 to be patient this year , with a promise that a reelected @entity2 , unbound by the need to win votes , would make a forceful return to his mediation efforts			1
even with @entity117 , @entity2 has been perceived as putting political goals ahead of strategic decisions			2
@entity120 , president @entity121 on @entity122 , suggested that the november election is the main reason why @entity2 has not ordered a faster draw - down of troops			1
" but wait till next year , " he wrote			2
" the fig leaf of vital interests will no longer be sustainable in the postelection marketplace			0
" while the @entity2 administration tries to plug all the holes , or at least slow the leaks until it has more freedom of movement , its timid efforts in @entity5 are starting to look like an abdication of a fundamental moral duty			1
the death toll in @entity5 continues to rise , with more than 13,000 people killed			2
at this rate , the political cost of doing nothing will outweigh the risk of taking action			0
there is no obvious , easy answer			0
and the @entity9 people so far seem to have no desire to see @entity9 forces step in to stop the horrifying massacres			2
but @entity64 could , without sending in @entity9 troops , take a stronger leadership role			2
pressure is mounting on @entity2 to launch a more muscular response as @entity5 unravels and risks creating chaos in other parts of the region			1
even @entity159 are making a case for @entity9 intervention			2
after all , @entity5 is @entity90 's closest ally			0
helping to staunch the bloodshed there could help prevent a war with @entity90 by weakening @entity107 's hand			0
the @entity9 could also try to fortify the @entity5 opposition and work with other @entity169 countries who want to see @entity171 removed from power			1
for too long , the @entity87 placed its faith in a plan negotiated by former @entity176 chief @entity175 , which was doomed to fail from the very beginning			0
@entity64 has blamed @entity179 for the diplomatic stalemate and the lack of progress in @entity5 , but not everyone buys that argument			0
@entity2 would like to prevent a major crisis with uncertain political ramifications from standing in the way of his reelection			1
but the tragedy in @entity5 is not waiting until november			1
sure , everyone would like to see all the tough geopolitical problems solved by diplomacy , with a handshake and a smile , without massacres of civilians and lies from dictators			0
but the world does not work that way			0
sometimes history has lousy timing			0
and presidents do n't get to make three wishes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			0

@entity209 : @entity2 tries to keep the crisis in @entity5 from interfering with reelection
@entity213 : carnage in @entity5 could go on longer than in a nonelection year
she says electoral considerations are often a major factor in @entity9 foreign policy
@entity213 : tragedy in @entity5 is n't waiting till november ; @entity2 should take action now
