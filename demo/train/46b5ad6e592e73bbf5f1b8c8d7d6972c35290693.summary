-- one of the first photos it sent home showed a self - portrait of its shadow			2
the dark gray specter of machinery against a lighter grainy backdrop showed up minutes after the news of its arrival , as if to say " i 'm here ! " with its cameras as our eyes , it opened our minds to un-roved territory			0
if you 're a @entity20 engineer , you might even call it " she			0
" @entity23 , @entity20 's most sophisticated and complex @entity25 rover , touched down on the @entity25 on the morning of august 6 , 2012 ( august 5 if you 're in @entity26 )			1
the $ 2.5 billion mission set out to explore @entity28 , which was thought to have once hosted flowing water , and find out if that environment was once habitable			0
spoiler alert : it was			0
but that 's not all the rover found while traveling 1.6 kilometers across @entity25 ' barren surface during its 12 months on the planet			1
curiosity has collected 190 gigabits of data and sent back more than 36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnail images , @entity20 said			2
the rover has also fired more than 75,000 laser shots to help scientists analyze the composition of material , and collected samples from two rocks			2
@entity20 scientists joke that the " warranty " on @entity23 is two years , since that was the rover 's design specification , said @entity53 , deputy project scientist for the @entity54			1
but other robotic vehicles have far outlasted their projected lifetimes			0
@entity20 landed twin rovers @entity57 on @entity25 in 2004 , and @entity59 is still chugging along			1
( @entity60 stopped communicating in 2010 )			0
now , @entity23 is on its way to @entity63 , a three - mile - high structure made of layers that , scientists believe , recorded @entity25 ' geological history			1
" it 's a lot of work and a lot of people involved , but it 's wonderful in the sense that it 's really capable scientifically , " @entity53 said of the rover			2
" we 're always amazed at how much we can do through this robot			0
" to mark the anniversary of its first year on @entity25 , @entity23 played " @entity79 " to itself monday night , using an on - board instrument to beep out the tune			1
no word on whether anyone was listening			0
here are five fascinating milestones from @entity23 's first 12 months : 1			0
@entity84 , it actually landed			0
how do you land a two - ton , car - sized rover on another planet ? engineers thought about it a lot , and came up with a complex plan requiring a sky crane and the world 's largest supersonic parachute			1
the acrobatic maneuvers required to get it safely to the ground were dubbed the " seven minutes of terror , " as featured in a @entity20 video simulation depicting just how many things had to go right to get the rover on the ground in one piece			0
@entity104 , lead engineer overseeing the rover 's arrival , told reporters a few days before the big night , " i promise you it is the least crazy of the methods you could use to get a rover the size of curiosity on @entity25			1
" for the social media generation , this was our moon landing			0
the @entity116 went wild over a rover flight director who showed up for work on landing night with a mohawk , got hailed as " @entity121 , " and later received a shout - out from president @entity123			1
curiosity itself has a verified @entity127 account ( with 1.3 million followers ) , and tweeted that night , " i 'm safely on the surface of @entity25			1
@entity28 i am in you ! ! ! # @entity54			0
" " the overall highlight , i think , even a year later , still is planning successfully and seeing @entity28 for the first time , " @entity53 said			0
he added : " we landed much more smoothly than we ever rehearsed it			0
life on @entity25 could have existed			1
this was the major science highlight of @entity23 's inaugural @entity25 year , @entity53 said			1
although this discovery builds upon previous ideas , @entity23 provided enough confirmation for scientists to finally come out and say it : the environment @entity23 has been exploring was once habitable			0
" we now know @entity25 offered favorable conditions for microbial life billions of years ago , " said the mission 's project scientist , @entity143 of the @entity145			1
@entity23 became the first robot to drill on another planet , and the powder on the drill bit gave the scientists sufficient evidence to say that life could have survived in that area			1
the drill material had chemicals important for life in it , including sulfur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and carbon			0
also excitingly for scientists , the sample contained a type of clay that forms in the presence of water			0
the rover 's @entity170 ( @entity172 ) additionally spotted evidence of water - bearing minerals in the @entity175 where @entity23 first drilled			1
scientists detected minerals using the camera 's infrared - imaging capability			2
gallery : @entity23 's best photos of the @entity25 this area that @entity23 has been exploring is part of an alluvial fan , a formation of debris left by a river that once flowed into the crater , scientists say			1
" we investigated the fan and found evidence that there was very likely an intermittent lake that had freshwater at one point , " @entity53 said			1
@entity25 is red on top , gray below			2
that material in the drill bit that the rover used to probe rock was n't the same orange color that 's so familiar to us from the rover 's photography			2
instead , it was gray , scientists said in february			0
" you can probably bet that when things turn orange , it 's because there 's a rusting process of some kind going on that oxidizes the iron in the rock , " @entity206 , sampling system scientist for curiosity at @entity20 's @entity209 , said at the time			1
the planet 's atmosphere was destroyed a long time ago			1
using instruments on board @entity23 , scientists determined that the @entity25 atmosphere has n't changed much in the last 4 billion years , and during that whole time it has been thin , as well as inhospitable to life as we know it			1
initially , however , after the planet formed 4.5 billion years ago , the planet 's atmosphere was 100 times denser than the @entity230 's atmosphere , scientists say			1
their results were published in the journal @entity233 in july			0
we could learn even more about the atmosphere from @entity20 's @entity236 , which is expected to launch in november			0
this spacecraft will have techniques to measure the current rate of loss of the atmosphere			0
radiation makes the trip to @entity25 dangerous for humans			2
curiosity spent 253 days getting to @entity25 in 2012			1
during that time , the mission ( officially called @entity54 ) was collecting data about radiation on the journey to the @entity25 using the @entity251 device			2
an analysis of this data , published in the journal @entity233 in may , found that @entity25 - bound pioneers would be exposed to radiation levels that could effectively retire astronauts under @entity20 's current standards			1
" the radiation environment in deep space is several hundred times what it is on @entity230 , and that 's even inside a shielded spacecraft , " said @entity259 , principal scientist for the @entity260			2
scientists are working on faster engines to shorten the trip to @entity25 , and may be able to conceive of a spacecraft with better shielding			2
501 days in space with your spouse : could you handle it ? what 's next ? drive , drive , drive ! the rover 's second year will be mostly about the five - mile drive to @entity63 , @entity53 said			1
so far , @entity23 has stopped a lot to test out its instruments , collecting and analyzing samples and exploring particular areas			0
now , it will drive as far as it can every day -- but not at @entity286 highway speeds			0
@entity53 's hope is to get the rover to @entity63 by next summer			1
during the drive , the rover will continue snapping photos , and the meteorological instruments will still take measurements			0
curiosity will stop if it spots anything -- a structure or formation , or the improbable @entity25 -- that looks interesting to scientists			2
in 2020 , another @entity20 rover is planned to join the small fleet of human - made vehicles on @entity25			1
this one may be able to collect samples for potential return to @entity230 , and test technology relevant to human exploration			0
meanwhile , the opportunity rover rolls along , in its 10th year , exploring @entity25 on the opposite side of the planet from @entity23			1
none of these rovers may ever meet			0
but perhaps their tracks will mark the paths where humans will someday tread			0
@entity317 : get to @entity25 within 20 years follow @entity318 on @entity127 and @entity319 .			2

curiosity landed on @entity25 on august 6 , 2012 ( august 5 in the *western* @entity322 )
the rover will make a 5 - mile journey to the planet 's @entity63
scientist says landing the rover itself was a major *accomplishment*
rover found evidence that life could have existed on @entity25
