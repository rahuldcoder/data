-- it 's fair to say that the year in music has been one filled with surprises			1
@entity5 made his return to music last the entire year , while @entity9 's comeback with " the @entity10 " was more impromptu			1
@entity12 went left with " @entity13 " while @entity14 tried to upset the way albums are released -- only to be upstaged by his wife , @entity17 , mere months later			1
and when @entity0 readers chose as their favorites of 2013 , there were surprises there as well			1
where 2012 was dominated by artists who were carried on the strength of one song -- @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 -- 2013 favored the more established , as well as the artists who showed that they had more than a single hit to offer			2
at no. 1 was mr. " @entity36 " @entity5 , followed by industry " @entity35 " @entity32 and an enlightened @entity34			0
there were still a few artists who shone brightly thanks to a boost from a particular song -- such as @entity41 with " @entity42 " and @entity43 with " @entity44 " -- but even those musicians have much more to offer beyond those undeniable hits of 2013			0
