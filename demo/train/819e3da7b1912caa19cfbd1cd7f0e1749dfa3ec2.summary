@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was expected to be a court date like no other , with @entity1 riveted to a financial corruption case that involves members of the royal family			1
but on saturday , when princess @entity10 arrived at the courthouse here just before 10 a.m. , she offered them little			1
" @entity16 dias , " she told reporters			1
" with that , she entered the building for a proceeding that was closed to the public in a courtroom where a photograph of her father , @entity24 , hangs on a wall			2
as head of state , his photograph hangs at many courts			0
outside , several hundred anti-monarchy and pro-republic demonstrators chanted noisily			0
an audio recording was made of her testimony , but it is intended for internal court use only			0
upon leaving about seven hours later , she offered the news media little more than she had given upon arrival			0
" hasta luego , " she said			1
" her appearance marked the first time a direct member of @entity1 's royal family was to testify in court while facing preliminary charges for a crime , according to @entity1 's royal household			1
her husband , @entity49 , faces preliminary charges in the same matter and testified a year ago			2
the case centers on his nonprofit @entity54 foundation , which received millions of dollars in government contracts to stage sports and tourism events			2
@entity10 maintained her innocence , lawyers said judge @entity60 is investigating whether part of that money may have been diverted for private use by the princess , who is 48 , and her husband , 46			1
through their legal teams , both deny any wrongdoing , and in court on saturday , the princess maintained her innocence , lawyers who were present at the proceedings said			1
the closed - door testimony for the princess was held at a local court here in the @entity76			0
the courthouse is near the @entity78 , the royal family 's summer residence on @entity80 , one of @entity83 's top tourist destinations			0
judge @entity60 last april leveled preliminary charges against the princess in this case , but they were dropped in may after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court , citing insufficient evidence			2
but @entity60 continued his investigation and last month issued a 227 - page order , again bringing preliminary charges against the princess , for alleged tax fraud and money laundering through a separate company , @entity98 , in which she had a 50 % stake , with her husband holding the rest			2
" they used that company to pocket the public money and also to pay the lowest possible tax or simply cheat the @entity110 , " said @entity101 , investigations editor at @entity103 newspaper who co-authored a book , " @entity106 , " about the alleged financial improprieties			0
" in that company , princess @entity10 is the one who signs the annual reports , " @entity101 said			1
when the new preliminary charges were filed in january , @entity10 's top lawyer , veteran politician and defense attorney @entity115 , told reporters they would appeal			2
but a week later , there was a sudden change of position , and it was announced that the princess would testify			0
@entity115 appeared with his client at the courthouse on saturday			0
the about - face was not due to pressure from the royal household , but instead was a personal decision by the princess , who persuaded her defense team on the issue , said an official familiar with discussions within the royal household , who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
" it was her decision to testify , simply because she has nothing to hide , and she 's convinced the preliminary charges could be dropped , and it 's better to testify than let the idea of cowardice be out there , " the official said			0
the preliminary charges eventually could be dropped , but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion			0
one of various corruption scandals during the economic crisis the case is one of various financial corruption scandals affecting the royal family and major political parties and a leading union , during the economic crisis , when many @entity1 have lost jobs or had to tighten their financial belts			1
princess @entity10 's testimony comes as a new report by the @entity161 shows that 95 % of @entity1 say that corruption is widespread in the nation			1
the royal household two years ago excluded @entity10 and her husband from representing @entity1 at official functions , like one in @entity168 this week , when the @entity24 , @entity169 , crown prince @entity170 and his wife , @entity171 , welcomed the foreign diplomatic corps			1
but some @entity1 say the princess is still getting special treatment			1
" it 's great they 're finally bringing preliminary charges , " said student @entity175 , outside the royal palace in @entity168 , on friday			0
" but considering she 's the @entity24 's daughter , she 'll be very protected , and wo n't go to jail			0
" @entity1 media reports said the judge is not expected to immediately issue a decision on whether to proceed with the case or to drop the charges against the princess			1
@entity2 's @entity186 contributed to this report			2
