-- when i learned about the tragic shooting at @entity4 elementary school , i wept and mourned like many other @entity5			0
i was also reminded of my own daughter 's death 32 years ago			1
for those parents , families or friends of victims who want to see less guns fall into the hands of potential shooters , my personal journey may help serve as a path for change			2
my daughter , @entity18 , was killed by a multiple repeat offender drunk driver on may 3 , 1980			1
four days later , i started @entity21			1
i was shocked to learn that over the past decade , approximately 250,000 people were killed in alcohol - related fatal crashes			2
at that time , public health professionals considered drunk driving to be the no. 1 killer of @entity5 between the ages of 15 and 24			1
drunk driving seemed like the only socially acceptable form of homicide in this country and the attitude toward perpetrators was benign , if not passive			1
i also learned that probably nothing would happen to the man who killed my daughter			1
so i became a grass roots activist			0
as i found out , grass roots means , " working outside the system to change the inequities within " and activist means , " getting the job done			2
" i started @entity21 because i was angry over the injustice of the status quo			1
over time , my efforts helped incite others to action			0
you kick a few pebbles , you turn a few stones , and eventually you have an avalanche			0
my " kicking a few pebbles " began in my home with the help of my father and a few friends			0
within three years , @entity21 developed into an international organization with almost 400 chapters worldwide , a staff of 50 employees , 2 million members , thousands of volunteers and an annual budget of more than $ 12 million			1
initially , we were mothers who lost children , but soon our membership included everyone who believed in our cause			0
before long , voices from long forgotten victims who lost loved ones to drunk driving became loud and clear			1
it was gratifying to realize that many people , given a chance , wanted the same things i did			0
our small grass - roots movement grew into a groundswell that radically changed society 's views on drunk driving			1
early on , it became clear that i must seek broad and strategic alliances for @entity21 to be successful			1
i turned to law enforcement officials , restaurateurs , legislators and civic organizations			0
it was only by building broad coalitions of such highly influential constituents that @entity21 , during my tenure , was able to initiate a sweeping change in public attitudes and laws against drunk driving			1
there is another very important factor that helped our cause : the power of media attention			2
from 1980 to 1983 , when @entity21 was very active , some of the biggest reductions in motor vehicle deaths occurred in large part because of the media attention we were able to generate			1
@entity108 , director of the @entity109 at the @entity110 , said in a @entity112 article , " during each high media period , alcohol related fatalities ... fell twice as rapidly as low media periods			2
" before @entity21 , there was little education in the schools about alcohol or impaired driving			1
the press rarely mentioned alcohol involvement when reporting a crash			0
drinking and driving was still legal in many states			2
victims of drunk driving had almost no recourse in an apathetic court system more concerned about the rights of the accused			1
involvement in the judicial process was discouraged			0
victims had no movement to join , little or no legislation to endorse , and no emotional support system where they could share their grief			2
the advent of @entity21 changed all that : governor 's task forces on drunk driving were formed in almost every state			1
at our urging , president @entity144 initiated a @entity147 on @entity148 , and i was a member			0
@entity21 was the catalyst for @entity151 , @entity152 , started by my daughter , @entity153			1
we aggressively lobbied for state and federal legislation that would raise the legal drinking age to 21 , and we pushed for laws that would hold drunk drivers accountable for their crimes			2
between 1981 and 1986 , 729 state laws pertaining to drunk driving were enacted to help reduce alcohol - related traffic fatalities most importantly , hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved because of the grass - roots efforts society no longer considers drunk driving socially acceptable			1
at long last , in many cases , drunk drivers are being forced to accept responsibility for their heinous acts because a fed up public has had enough			2
@entity21 is a good example of how to change society			1
we did n't give up and neither should those who wish to see a safer world			0
you can have an impact and you can save lives			0
that was the least i could do for my daughter			0
i feel the pain for families of those who died at @entity4			0
for those who want to do something about gun violence , change is n't easy			1
what is needed is a grass - roots movement similar to @entity21 that encompasses all aspects of society			1
to be effective , it must include all the stakeholders involved and reach a consensus that will make implementation -- whether in laws , increased education or other policy changes -- a given			0
ask for a @entity147 while the @entity201 is focused on this issue			0
do n't take no for an answer			0
accept each obstacle as a challenge to be overcome			0
engage the media and harness the outpouring and support that is pouring in			1
leadership is key and @entity21 had that at the local , state and national level			2
develop a strategy that people can follow and provide directions and concrete steps that will guarantee successes and keep people motivated			0
do n't lose the momentum , anger and rage			0
now is the time to take action			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

@entity228 : after my daughter was killed by a drunk driver , i started @entity21
@entity234 : @entity21 radically changed our society 's view toward drunk driving
she says those who want to change our gun *culture* can look to @entity21 's strategy
