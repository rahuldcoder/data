@entity0 -- veteran cagefighter @entity2 has so far worked to deradicalize 10 convicted terrorists after they completed their prison terms in the @entity5			1
his work combines teaching @entity8 skills and a humanistic and tolerant interpretation of @entity10 that traces its roots back to the @entity12			0
his success has been noted by @entity5 officials who are trying to work out if it can be replicated on a larger scale			0
read how @entity2 's controversial technique works , is changing lives , and getting noticed			1
here are some of his cases : @entity21 , a @entity5 - @entity22 , who is now 28 , was in 2005 convicted of terrorism in what prosecutors alleged was a thwarted plot he embarked on that year to track down and kill or severely harm a @entity5 soldier who had returned from @entity28			2
he had pleaded not guilty to a charge of possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism			0
@entity21 was released in 2009 under strict conditions but recalled to prison several months later because he was assessed as still dangerous			0
after he was again released in march 2011 , he entrusted himself to @entity2 , under whose mentorship he appears to have shed his radical views			1
@entity21 's police mug shot was used in @entity5 newspaper stories warning of a threat from released terrorist convicts to the @entity42			1
he says he now wants to stop other young @entity43 from repeating his mistakes			0
" i learned the hard way , " he told @entity1			0
@entity2 said his first terrorist case was @entity47 , now 33 , a @entity5 - @entity48 resident of @entity0 , who was arrested by police after he landed in @entity50 in 2006 after a trip overseas			1
police say they found instructions on how to make a viable rocket on his hard - drive , and at his home violent videos of terrorist attacks and beheadings			0
the following year @entity47 was found guilty of possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism			0
according to @entity2 , when he was released in 2008 , @entity47 was very reluctant to work with @entity43 community groups enlisted by probation services to rehabilitate offenders			1
but @entity47 heard about @entity2 through friends who had trained with him in mixed martial arts and agreed to meet him			2
in the early summer of 2009 they met in a probation office in @entity0 and from there @entity47 wanted to work with @entity2			1
he said @entity47 was interested in getting mixed martial arts training , and the instruction he gave him in cage fighting allowed him to build up a mentoring relationship			0
the two had wide - ranging discussions about @entity10 , during which time @entity2 was able to impress upon @entity47 his humanistic approach to the religion			2
" what i think he recognized was our sincerity - that we were doing this for the infinite good , " @entity2 told @entity1			2
the former convict is now working at a charity providing a support structure for muslims convicted of criminal offenses after their release from prison , according to @entity2			1
@entity93 @entity2 described how another one of his early success stories was @entity93 , a radicalized @entity5 - @entity100 convert who was 34 when convicted in 2005 of terrorism offenses after instructions on how to fire mortars , a coded list of methods of attack , possible targets , and traces of explosive were found on his possessions			1
@entity93 had travelled to several @entity107 fronts , including @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity22 and @entity110 and was described as " a global terrorist [ who ] has been trained and knows how to use extreme violence , " by a senior @entity5 counter-terrorism official			0
@entity2 says @entity93 began training on mixed martial arts whilst in prison			2
on his release @entity2 provided him with further martial arts instruction , which helped him forge a mentoring relationship			2
@entity2 said @entity93 was already looking to improve his religious understanding , making him open to @entity2 's message			1
other cases @entity2 has also worked with two men convicted of terrorism offenses in relation to the failed july 21 , 2005 bombing attack on @entity0 , a man convicted of a terrorist arson attack , as well as several other former terrorist convicts			1
