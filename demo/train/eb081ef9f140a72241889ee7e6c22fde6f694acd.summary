-- he 's terrified millions of children with his books , from " welcome to the @entity4 " to " @entity5			1
" but @entity6 is n't ready to let his audience grow up in peace			2
with the 20th anniversary of his popular " @entity12 " series comes @entity14 's adult horror novel " @entity15			1
" the book follows travel writer @entity17 into the middle of a devastating hurricane and out again with a pair of evil twins who will wreak their own kind of devastation on her family			1
@entity14 is n't the first young - adult author to venture into adult fiction			1
@entity28 recently released a novel titled " @entity30 " that sold 157,000 hardcover copies in its first week of publication , according to @entity33			1
beloved " @entity35 " creator @entity34 has also moved into the adult world with her characters ; @entity38 and @entity39 grew up in " @entity40 " and started their 30s in this summer 's novella e-series " @entity44			1
" " @entity15 " is n't even the first adult book @entity14 has written			1
in 2000 , he released a novel called " @entity48 " about a professor named @entity50 who is the most superstitious man in the world , for good reason			2
@entity14 's publishers expected a best - seller , but book sales were mediocre for an author with such a big reputation			1
" it was too early to do an adult novel			1
no one asked about it			2
... i 've been waiting by the phone for 12 years , " @entity14 joked			1
this time , his fans are ready			2
they 've been hounding @entity14 on @entity66 -- he has almost 60,000 followers -- asking him to write a book for them			1
" that 's how i keep in touch , " @entity14 said			1
" there are no kids on @entity66			2
it 's all people ( in their 20s , 30s ) who read ' @entity12 ' and ' @entity76 ' in the ' 90s			2
they were my huge audience			0
" @entity14 has written more than 300 books that have sold a combined 350 million copies around the world			1
( at one point , he was churning out 12 " @entity12 " books a year ; now he 's down to six			2
) at the recent @entity91 in @entity92 , the author 's autograph line seemed endless			0
it was 7 - year - olds , 10 - year - olds , 20 - year - olds , 30 - year - olds			0
half of them were like , ' i loved your books when i was a kid , ' " @entity14 said			1
" it 's great for my ego			0
" @entity105 , editor for " @entity15 " as well as the vice president and publisher for @entity108 , knows @entity14 's work well			1
her 10 - year - old son devours his books " like crack			2
" " to see that kind of enthusiasm in my own son , it was easy to see if , you know , someone checked in with him 10 , 15 years from now			0
... i think he 'd be pretty intrigued			0
" @entity14 sent @entity105 an outline for " @entity15			1
" the plot he wanted to tackle seemed so complicated , @entity105 was a little nervous			0
but after receiving the finished novel , she said , she would have published the book even from an unknown author			2
of course , having @entity14 's name attached added a bit of glamour			1
" i knew he had the chops to do it , because i think writers are writers , " @entity105 said			0
" but man , he just slammed it			0
" there are pitfalls to having a children 's author write an adult novel			2
although @entity28 's " @entity30 " is on track to become one of the best - selling hardcover novels of the year , it has received mixed reviews			1
" after all of this magic , what could we have expected ? " professor @entity145 wrote for @entity146			0
" ' @entity30 ' may be a disappointment , but it is a natural one			0
for after having written books of magic for a magical age , @entity28 has come out with a book of @entity155 life for @entity155			1
is this what happens when you grow up ? " @entity162 's " @entity40 " ended up on best - seller lists as well , but fans were outraged at the experiences @entity162 crafted for her once - innocent teen characters			0
" i felt a 27 - year - old woman ( @entity38 ) was entitled to an orgasm , " @entity162 said with a laugh			0
" you would be surprised at how many responses i got that did n't feel that way			0
... i had somehow maligned their hero , and it was not good			0
" @entity162 's idea for an adult novel came in a similar way to @entity14 's			1
@entity177 was her inspiration ; on the social media site , she said , everyone is looking for the kid they grew up with , the friend from elementary school , their high school sweetheart			0
" strangely enough , even though these are fictional characters , they are real ( to fans ) , " @entity162 said			0
" i thought they would have a curiosity to find out what happened to these people they lived with			0
" curiosity seems to have outweighed outrage for the millions of @entity35 readers			0
" @entity44 " e-series was downloaded more than 40,000 times			0
a copy of all six novellas will be available in one hardcover book october 30			0
@entity14 wo n't have to wait long to see whether " @entity15 " is a success ; the book is released tuesday			1
if it is , he just might continue to give his grown - up fans goosebumps			0
" i 'll wait by the phone , see if it 's another 12 years , " @entity14 laughed			1
" i 'd love to do another one			0
