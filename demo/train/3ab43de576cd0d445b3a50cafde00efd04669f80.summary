@entity0 -- the @entity2 promised thursday to send food and medical supplies -- but not weapons -- to rebels in the first such move since the conflict began two years ago			1
at the same time , @entity10 nations began to explore how to strengthen rebel fighters short of arming them after a @entity13 decision allowing aid for civilian protection			0
@entity2 secretary of state @entity16 said the aid would help fighters in their effort to topple @entity21 president @entity20			1
the conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives , laid waste to large portions of the country and created an enormous humanitarian crisis as refugees flee the fighting			0
the fighting also threatens to widen into a regional crisis and has raised concerns that @entity33 , @entity34 or others could gain control in @entity37 after @entity20 's government falls			0
" the @entity2 ' decision to take further steps now is the result of the continued brutality of a superior armed force propped up by foreign fighters from @entity34 and @entity33 , all of which threatens to destroy @entity21 , " @entity16 said after meeting opposition leaders in @entity0			1
he did not say how much aid , but did announce that the @entity2 would separately give $ 60 million to local groups working with the opposition @entity50 to provide political administration and basic services in rebel - controlled areas of @entity21			1
that 's on top of $ 50 million in similar aid the @entity2 has previously pledged to the council , as well as $ 385 million in humanitarian assistance , @entity16 said			1
" this funding will allow the opposition to reach out and help the local councils to be able to rebuild in their liberated areas of @entity21 so that they can provide basic services to people who so often lack access today to medical care , to food , to sanitation , " he said			2
@entity69 the aid represents , in part , an effort to hem in radical @entity69 groups vying for influence in @entity21 after the fall of @entity20 , a senior @entity74 official told @entity1			1
" if the @entity21 opposition coalition ca n't touch , improve and heal the lives of @entity21 in those places that have been freed , then extremists will step in and do it , " the official said			2
@entity83 , president of the @entity50 , said concerns about @entity69 influence were overstated			0
" we stand against every radical belief that aims to target @entity21 's diverse social and religious fabric , " he said			2
@entity2 officials hope the aid will help the coalition show what it can do and encourage @entity20 supporters to " peel away from him " and help end the fighting , the official said			2
the opposition council will decide where the money goes , @entity16 said			0
but the @entity2 will send technical advisers through its partners to the group 's @entity105 headquarters to ensure the aid is used properly , the senior @entity74 official said			1
additional aid possible the @entity13 carved out an exception in its sanctions against @entity21 on thursday to allow for the transfer of nonlethal equipment and technical assistance for civilian protection only			2
the council did not specify what kind of equipment could be involved			0
@entity119 foreign secretary @entity118 said friday on @entity120 that his country would pledge new aid because " we can not stand still while the crisis worsens and thousands of lives are at stake			1
" a diplomatic official at the @entity128 told @entity1 that @entity129 is studying the possibility of supplying night - vision equipment or body armor			1
in the @entity2 , president @entity133 is thinking about training rebels and equipping them with defensive gear such as night - vision goggles , body armor and military vehicles , sources familiar with the discussions said			1
the training would help rebels decide how to use their resources , strategize and perhaps train a police force to take over after @entity20 's fall , one of the sources said			2
@entity16 did not announce that sort of aid thursday , but said the @entity2 and other countries backing the rebels would " continue to consult with each other on an urgent basis			1
" an official told reporters that the opposition has raised a number of needs in the @entity0 meetings and the administration will continue to " keep those under review			0
" " we will do this with vetted individuals , vetted units , so it has to be done carefully and appropriately , " the official said			0
humanitarian crisis meanwhile , the bloodshed continued			0
on thursday , 98 people were killed across @entity21 , including 35 in @entity37 and its suburbs , said the @entity173 for @entity21 , a network of opposition activists			2
the conflict began with demands for political reform after the @entity180 movement that swept the @entity181 and @entity182 , but devolved into civil war when the @entity20 regime cracked down on demonstrators			0
in addition to the 60,000 people who have died since the fighting began in march 2011 , another 940,000 have fled the country and more than 10 % of @entity21 's 20 million residents have been forced to move elsewhere inside the country , the @entity186 high commissioner for refugees said			1
the outpouring of refugees threatens to overwhelm the ability of host nations to provide for their needs , assistant high commissioner @entity193 told the @entity200 on tuesday			0
@entity201 reported from @entity0 , and @entity202 reported and wrote from @entity203			0
@entity1 's @entity204 and @entity205 also contributed to this report .			0

@entity129 considers sending @entity21 rebels night - vision gear and body armor , a source says
@entity119 's foreign secretary says the @entity119 will announce new aid soon
@entity2 will send *non-lethal* aid to rebels , plus $ 60 million in administrative aid
