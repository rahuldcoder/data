-- on the afternoon last week when the @entity3 jury rendered its verdict , you just know that someone , in some entertainment - industry high - rise office suite somewhere , was seeing the invisible lightbulb click on : @entity10 ! the next big reality - show idea			1
no , not a show about @entity3			1
that 's not thinking big enough			1
but as the anxiety built up during the 14 days of deliberations , as panels of journalists , attorneys and retired judges filled airtime guessing what the outcome would be , the concept was dangling out there like a fresh , ripe , red apple , just begging to be picked : a jury , deliberating			1
impossible , you say ? it could never happen ? never say never			0
the jury room is @entity33 's last secret place			1
once the testimony in a trial has ended , and the door to the jury room closes , all is mystery			1
high - powered lawyers , distinguished judges , hard - charging prosecutors , wealthy defendants			1
all of them may be prominent during the public part of a trial , but once the jury begins its deliberations those courtroom players are as in the dark as anyone else			1
in a society that seems to be willingly throwing away all vestiges of privacy , the jury room is still sacrosanct			1
when trials end , some jurors decide to talk to reporters , but by then the outcome is public			0
and a juror 's retelling of the deliberations , regardless of how precise , ca n't match the moment - to - moment tension of the real thing while it is unfolding			1
a handful of times in the decades since television was introduced to the @entity33 , judges have allowed documentary crews to record jury deliberations for future airing			2
such instances have been exceedingly rare			0
justice is not entertainment ; the determination of someone 's guilt or innocence is not amusement			2
but , of course , just about everything else in @entity33 life has been turned into entertainment and amusement			0
so we should n't rule out the possibility that at some point , in some state , rationalizations will be made and cameras will be placed in jury rooms for a continuing television series			2
and how great a leap is it , really , from cameras in the courtrooms to cameras in the jury rooms ? reasons not to do it are myriad : jurors might be reluctant to speak candidly knowing they are being watched by people at home ; some jurors , on the other hand , might seek stardom by playing to the cameras ; men and women who might make excellent jurors would be made uncomfortable by the whole process and ask not to serve			2
the argument presented in favor of it will be that the jury system is such a fundamental part of the nation 's identity that the public would be well served to be able to see exactly what goes on as a case is decided			1
there will be promises : no juror will be televised if he or she does n't want to ; no case will be sent to a jury room with cameras unless the judge , the prosecutors , the defense lawyers and the defendants agree on it			2
still think it wo n't happen ? here 's why it might : in some state somewhere in the @entity33 , when dwindling budgets for the courts have reached crisis proportions , a proposal will be made by a television production company : we will pay [ fill in the monetary blanks ] dollars for the right to televise your juries			1
with that money you can hire more judges , you can modernize your courtrooms , you can increase the number of prosecutors and public defenders			0
this will be good for you , and will be good for society			0
and someone , somewhere , will swallow hard and say yes			0
will the result be a nonfiction version of the cinematic classic " @entity155 " ? or will it be " @entity157 " with bailiffs ? the dramatic possibilities are unarguable			1
if television viewers get breathless waiting to see who is voted off an island , think of the anticipation as the decision is made whether to set someone free or send him to prison			0
" @entity168 , " all right			0
you can almost hear the promotional tagline now : " twelve strangers are sent into a small room			0
by the time they come out			0
. " most judges would undoubtedly reject all this out of hand , but there are some who like publicity more than others			0
with a big enough jury pool , it would hardly be difficult to find 12 men and women who would welcome the opportunity to deliberate on national television			1
for every defense attorney who would find the concept abhorrent , there might be another who would silently think : my client does n't have much of a chance in this case anyway ; i might as well say yes to the jury being televised , because then i 'll have a video and audio record to search for errors that will help us win an appeal			2
and the tv shows themselves ? the jury deliberations would have to be heavily edited to get rid of the tedious parts			2
trials would be shown on a delayed basis , because most of the country would n't be familiar with the cases anyway , and would be unaware of the verdicts			0
but when the ratings needed a boost , you can imagine the producers ' pitches to the presiding local judge : " we want to do this one in real time , to be shown after court ends each night you know how sometimes you instruct jurors not to read the papers or watch tv ? well , the hook this time will be to turn that around			0
the whole country will be watching the jury on tv -- but you 'll forbid the defendant , the prosecutors and the defense attorneys from watching			2
they 'll be the only people in @entity33 who wo n't know what the jurors are saying			0
. " this all sounds like a bad dream , right ? in other words : television gold			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			1

@entity239 says @entity3 jury verdict likely led to some exec 's @entity10 moment
why not a reality show about a deliberating jury ? , he speculates
he says in a tell - all culture , with cash - *strapped* courts , someone , somewhere is bound to allow it
@entity239 : dramatic possibilities *endless* , as are potential *abuses* . but it would sell big
