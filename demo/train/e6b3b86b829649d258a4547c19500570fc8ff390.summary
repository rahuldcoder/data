@entity15 , co-author of " @entity16 : @entity20 and the @entity21 in the 1960s , '' says the @entity7 revolution was " tremendously liberating " for members of the most vulnerable groups in @entity14			2

" @entity5 is living in a different age , " @entity15 said			0
" the circumstances wo n't permit him to be another @entity8			1
