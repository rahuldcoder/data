-- for many families , the school year just started , but for @entity4 , it 's not too early to start planning for @entity5			1
the financially struggling single mother of fraternal twins recently asked her 8 - year - olds to write down a list of things they would like from @entity12			1
@entity4 , who works part time as an administrative assistant for a home health care company , wanted to start budgeting for the holidays			0
she knew her twins , who just began third grade , were at the age where they would start asking for electronics and other expensive gifts			0
her son , @entity22 's , letter to @entity12 started off normally : " @entity12 ... i wanted a ( remote control ) car and helicopter , but i do n't want that anymor			1
kid at school are still picking on @entity31 and its not fair , " he wrote			1
" i prayed that they will stop but god is bisy and needs your help			0
" @entity4 felt tears fill her eyes as she read her son 's letter asking @entity12 to help stop the bullying his overweight sister was experiencing at school			1

" i try to build up my daughter 's self - esteem and tell her she is beautiful , but people say hurtful things to me , because i also have a weight problem , and that hurts me , " she said			1
" i ca n't imagine what she goes through			0
" she had a vague idea that @entity31 was teased on the bus , but she did n't know the extent of the bullying			2
@entity31 , who has attention - deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder and other mental and mood disorders , never mentioned the teasing			2
bully - proofing your kids @entity4 explains that @entity31 is an emotional eater and weighs 140 pounds , nearly twice the size of her brother , @entity22			1
the twins returned to school three weeks ago at @entity68 in @entity69			2
it 's the first time @entity22 and @entity31 have been in the same classes			1
@entity22 would come up to @entity43 to tell her in private about classmates bullying @entity31 -- how the kids in gym class would laugh at her when she could not do the bear crawl on the floor , tease her about her weight in class or tell her that she was adopted because she is multiracial			1
" every day when she goes to school , she says , ' @entity81 , can i just stay at home ? ' and she just does n't want to go			2
' and now every time i send her to school , i feel like i am not protecting her and i am letting her down , " @entity4 said			0
after reading her son 's letter over the weekend , @entity43 shared it online with friends , including @entity91 's @entity90 page , where he features stories of inspiration , weight loss and life advice			1
@entity91 says he was moved by @entity22 's letter because it reminded him of his childhood			1
" when i was a kid , i was bullied for a bit " because of his weight , he explained			2
@entity91 posted the story to @entity102 , where it quickly garnered thousands of page views			1
" i wanted to do something to get ( the story ) out , " @entity105 said , adding that bullying is a serious issue that deserves attention			0

study authors @entity122 and @entity124 write , " given that school bullying is a widespread phenomenon in many countries around the world , the present results indicate that bullying should be considered a significant international public health problem			0
" others studies report that as many as one in four children is bullied			0
there have been several incidents of teens bullied to the point of committing suicide , most recently 12 - year - old @entity141 , who jumped off a building because of cyberbullying			1
@entity4 says @entity22 's letter to @entity12 sheds new light on her daughter 's situation , and she plans on speaking to @entity31 's teachers and the parents of the bullies at school			1
" if my kids do n't call names and pick on others , i would expect other parents to teach their kids to be respectful , too , " she said			0
" there have been times my kids would point at others and say , ' why is her hair so strange ' and things like that , and i would say , ' you know , people are different , and that is just the way they are			0
' " she says it 's important to realize that bullying comes in all sorts of forms			0
" i understand that sometimes schools try to do as much as they can , but bullying does n't have to physical ; name - calling and putting someone down are considered bullying to me			0
" and @entity4 says she is glad to have a selfless son like @entity22 -- plus @entity12 -- watching out for @entity31 , too			1
