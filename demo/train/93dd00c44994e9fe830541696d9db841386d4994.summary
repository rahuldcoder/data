while most of us are familiar with the word " meme " as the 21st century 's buzzword for the latest trends and multi-media conversations in social media , internet memes actually have been in active circulation for decades			1
they existed long before the arrival of web 2.0 , social networking and the so - called viral industry , back when @entity15 dial - up was your only key to the @entity18 and even before that , during the bygone years of @entity20 newsgroups			1
with this in mind , let 's take a look back at the top 10 most classic internet memes that have sprung up and defined our " cyberculture " as we once knew it			1
@entity30 ( 1980s ) " 1337speak , " read as leetspeak , is a corrupt style of the @entity34 language marked by liberal interchanging of numbers and symbols in place of certain letters that arose from the so - called " leet " ( " elite " ) subculture of hackers in the late 1980s , and later , gamers in the 1990s			0
though now considered an outdated vernacular , 1337speak established a way to " be cool " on the @entity48 and left many other lasting legacies in the online gaming world -- most notably " n00bs " ( newbies ) and " getting pwned " ( owned )			0
@entity51 ( 1990 ) in a telling sign that shows the @entity48 's penchant for arguing and mudslinging , one of the first internet memes to be referred to as such is a piece of @entity20 - era wisdom from @entity59 , who observed in 1990 that " as an internet discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving @entity62 or @entity63 approaches one			1
" since then , @entity51 has matured into an unspoken rule on message boards and forums that says : " if you mention @entity63 or the @entity62 to advance your argument in a discussion thread , you 've automatically ended and lost the debate			0
" @entity72 ( 1998 ) this very adorable ( and equally obnoxious ) homage to dancing hamsters went live in 1998 and quickly spread like a wildfire through newsgroups and e-mail chains , inspiring a series of copycats and parodies like " @entity81 , " the @entity82 " and even " the @entity83			1
" though it may not look like much in comparison to " @entity87 " or " @entity88 , " the dancing hamsters were declared one of the biggest sensations the @entity48 had ever seen at the time , along with the legendary " @entity91			0
" @entity92 ( 1998 ) originally found in the opening dialogue sequence from the 1989 @entity99 space shoot'em up game " @entity100 , " this awkward translation of the phrase " all of your bases are under our control " swept across gaming message boards and forums in the late 1990s , giving rise to one of the first epic - scale " @entity109 memes " based on poorly translated quotes from @entity99 video games and animes			2
not surprisingly , a number of other funny " @entity118 " moments from @entity117 video games were brought to light in the wake of " @entity92 , " including " @entity121 " ( @entity122 ) and " a winner is you " ( @entity124 )			0
you 're the @entity125 ( 2001 ) it 's impossible to talk about the state of internet humor and remix culture in the early 2000s without bringing up the names of a few websites , one of them being @entity135			2
while the site first began as a humble monument to an awesomely awkward quote uttered by @entity141 's character in the 2000 drama " @entity143 , " it inadvertently grew into a major creative hub for mash - ups and parodies of all things pop culture , like " the @entity149 " or " @entity151 's @entity150			0
" @entity152 ( 2003 ) the word may nowadays ring a bell with headlines about hacktivism , @entity155 ( distributed denial - of - service ) attacks and internet vigilantes , but the movement actually started back in 2003 as a far less political group of users on 4chan 's / b / board who would occasionally pull mass pranks on other online communities for their own entertainment under the collective pseudonym " @entity152 " -- a label that was designated to every user on / b / by default			2
in the following years , the group continued to build its notoriety through on - air prank calls and chat room raids , most notably the infamous @entity178 invasion in 2006 , until the launch of @entity180 in 2008			2
@entity181 ( 2003 ) yet another classic genre of internet humor that emerged at the turn of the century , this catch - all term quickly rose to favor in the early 2000s as people on the @entity48 began coming to terms with the fact that we love to laugh when others fail , a psychological behavior also known by the @entity195 word " schadenfreude			1
" the resounding impact of fail in humor can still be felt in today 's internet memescape , as we continue to celebrate others ' ineptitude through an evolving generation of emoticons and slang terms , such as * facepalm * , cringe and the look of disapproval			0
@entity210 ( 2003 ) " @entity210 " is a flash animation featuring an army of badgers dancing to a repetitive electronic song interspersed with occasional mentions of " mushroom			0
" created by @entity218 in 2003 , the animation not only provided a springboard for @entity221 's cartoon site @entity222 , but also served as the gateway meme to the @entity48 's fondness for mind - numbingly repetitive tunes that continues to this day			0
see : @entity87 @entity227 ( 2007 ) just in case you forgot , this is the story of how cats became the lions of the animal memedom			1
by the mid- 2000s , consumer - grade digital cameras pretty much had become a household staple , and with a stroke of genius on the meme factory of 4chan , thusly began the great invasion of the adorable and semi-literate cats , and their @entity241 , on the @entity48			1
in addition to making cats ever so popular , @entity227 also put the impact font on the map as the standard typeface of internet humor			1
@entity248 ( 2007 ) " @entity248 , " or tricking someone into clicking a link under the impression it will lead to something interesting , but instead serenades the viewer with @entity251 's " @entity250 , " led to the song became an unlikely hit over two decades after its release and brought the @entity261 singer back into the limelight			1
the meme also brought the concept of trolling into mainstream consciousness			0
there have been a number of successors to carry on this " bait - and - switch " tradition , some of the most popular choices being " @entity272 " and the wheelchair cliff scene from " @entity274			2

celebrating 25 years of the @entity18 , @entity277 *recalls* some of its finest memes
