@entity0 -- top @entity3 are prepared to short - circuit the traditional legislative process and exclude their @entity7 counterparts during final congressional health care deliberations , senior @entity3 sources have told @entity1			1
democrats are trying to prevent the @entity7 from using @entity12 rules to slow the push for final passage of a comprehensive reform bill , the sources added			1
house speaker @entity16 is set to discuss the politically contentious health care issue when she huddles in her office with other @entity20 @entity3 leaders tuesday afternoon			1
the @entity20 @entity3 leadership is also likely to meet with president @entity22 , and plans to hold a conference call with their entire caucus			2
the full @entity20 is not scheduled to return from vacation until january 12 ; the @entity12 meets january 19			2
@entity16 and @entity12 majority leader @entity28 , however , have already discussed the issue over the phone , aides said			0
congressional leaders are working to merge an $ 871 billion @entity12 bill and $ 1 trillion @entity20 bill that differ on several critical details			1
@entity3 leaders hope to get a bill to @entity22 's desk by early february , near the time of the president 's @entity42 address , several @entity3 sources have said			1
@entity16 admitted last month , however , that this deadline could slip			0
should the measure that emerges from @entity20 - @entity12 negotiations become law , it would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of @entity51 and @entity52 more than four decades ago			2
formal @entity20 - @entity12 negotiations , under the ordinary legislative process , would likely have started shortly after both houses of @entity56 reconvene			2
@entity3 concerns over the @entity7 's ability to slow the process , however , may result in the traditional process being replaced with informal , high - level talks , sources stated			1
in order to hold a formal conference , conferees -- members of the @entity20 and @entity12 -- must be formally appointed by both bodies , with resolutions passed by both the @entity12 and the @entity20			2
one @entity3 leadership aide said getting those resolutions passed in the @entity12 could delay and even derail @entity3 efforts , because @entity7 would be allowed to offer amendments and hold lengthy debates on the resolutions to appoint conferees			1
many observers believe the more liberal @entity20 measure will be largely forced to conform to the @entity12 bill			1
the traditionally fractious 60 - member @entity77 struggled to unify behind a single measure , and needs to remain united in order to overcome solid @entity7 opposition			0
the different approach to financing in the @entity20 and @entity12 bills is one of the many differences that must now be reconciled			1
the @entity20 measure is paid for through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy @entity89 and new @entity51 spending reductions			0
individuals with annual incomes over $ 500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $ 1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge			2
the @entity12 bill also cuts @entity51 by roughly $ 500 billion			1
but instead of an income tax surcharge on the wealthy , it would impose a 40 - percent tax on insurance companies that provide what are called " @entity102 " health plans valued at more than $ 8,500 for individuals and $ 23,000 for families			0
proponents of the tax on high - end plans argue it 's one of the most effective ways to curb medical inflation			0
however , @entity20 @entity3 oppose taxing such policies because it would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous health benefits			2
back in december , @entity22 predicted the final bill will probably end up with a variation of both the income tax surcharge and the tax on high - end plans			0
" @entity102 plans ... do n't make people healthier , but just take more money out of their pockets , " he argued in an interview with @entity118			0
the @entity12 bill also would hike @entity51 payroll taxes on families making over $ 250,000 ; the @entity20 bill does not			1
another key sticking point is the dispute over a public option			1
the @entity20 plan includes a public option ; the more conservative @entity12 package would instead create nonprofit private plans overseen by the federal government			1
given the reality of the 60 - vote threshold in the @entity12 , however , there has n't been much serious discussion among @entity20 leaders about pushing hard to keep the public option			1
one of the top @entity20 liberal leaders -- @entity140 rep. @entity139 -- recently said he could vote for a bill without the government insurance plan			2
" we want a public option to do basically three things : create more choice for insurers , create more competition for insurance companies , and to contain costs , " @entity139 said on the @entity144 program " @entity145			2
" so if we can come up with a process by which these three things can be done , then i 'm all for it			0
whether or not we label it a public option or not is of no consequence			2
" @entity161 rep. @entity160 , chairman of the @entity162 , said at the end of december on the show " @entity165 " that the public option is " not dead , but we also recognize that the @entity12 was able to just muster the 60 votes			1
" individuals under both plans would be required to purchase coverage , but the @entity20 bill includes more stringent penalties for most of those who fail to comply			1
the @entity20 bill would impose a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income			1
the @entity12 plan would require individuals to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750 or 2 percent of his or her income , whichever is greater			0
both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer @entity89			0
employers face a much stricter mandate under the @entity20 legislation , which would require companies with a payroll of more than $ 500,000 to provide insurance or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll			0
the @entity12 bill would require companies with more than 50 employees to pay a fee of up to $ 750 per worker if any of its employees rely on government subsidies to purchase coverage			1
abortion also has been a sticking point for both chambers			0
a compromise with @entity206 and other conservatives in the @entity20 led to the adoption of an amendment banning most abortion coverage from the public option			1
it also would prohibit abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies			0
@entity12 provisions , made more conservative than initially drafted in order to satisfy @entity221 sen. @entity220 , would allow states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the exchanges			0
individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds			0
@entity220 recently warned on @entity1 's " @entity228 " that he would withdraw his support if the final bill gets changed too much from the @entity12 version			1
despite their differences , however , the @entity20 and @entity12 have already reached agreement on a broad range of topics			2
both chambers have agreed to subsidize insurance for a family of four making up to roughly $ 88,000 annually , or 400 percent of the federal poverty level			0
they also have agreed to create health insurance exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses , the self - employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less - expensive coverage			0
both the @entity20 plan and the @entity12 bill would eventually limit total out - of - pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			1
insurers would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history			0
however , both bills allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for older customers			0
@entity52 would be significantly expanded under both proposals			0
the @entity20 bill would extend coverage to individuals earning up to 150 percent of the poverty level , or roughly $ 33,000 for a family of four			1
the @entity12 plan ensures coverage to those earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level , or just over $ 29,000 for a family of four			0
both the @entity20 and @entity12 bills would permit the creation of nonprofit private insurance cooperatives to increase competition			2
@entity1 's @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , and @entity275 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 sources say @entity7 could use @entity12 rules to slow final passage
congressional leaders have to merge an $ 871 billion @entity12 bill and $ 1 trillion @entity20 bill
many observers believe final version will look more like conservative @entity12 bill
financing , public option are key sticking points between @entity20 , @entity12 versions
