if you want to scare them away from drugs , this is the cartel you tell your children about			0
@entity5 revolutionized @entity7 drug trafficking with their brutality , and that unprecedented level of savagery could mean the end of the cartel 's nightmarish reign			1
" this is probably @entity23 as a coherent , cohesive organization , " said @entity14 , a former executive for @entity16 's civilian intelligence agency who now serves as security policy director for the @entity19 , a @entity21 think tank			1
take the group 's leader , @entity25 , aka " @entity27 " or " @entity25 , " who was taken into custody this week during a @entity31 operation south of his hometown of @entity34			2
@entity35 had a reputation for punishing his foes with " guisos , " @entity39 for " cookouts " and the term used for burning someone alive			0
with the @entity5 , it is n't about murder or torture			1
it 's about making a statement			0
that statement resounds so effectively that @entity49 , members of other cartels , dress like the group and claim to be them simply to instill fear			2
" @entity5 is a powerful brand , " @entity55 said			1
" it is identified with extreme violence			2
it is identified with a complete absence of scruples			0
" though @entity5 have long been known for their violence , especially after their suspected 2010 massacre of 72 migrants who refused to mule their drugs , two incidents got the attention of @entity69 and @entity7 authorities , @entity55 said			1
for cartels , business as usual in small - town @entity69 in february 2011 , two @entity73 agents were ambushed in the state of @entity75			1
agent @entity76 was fatally shot			2
about six months later , several men -- thought to be @entity5 ' extortion enforcers -- torched the @entity79 in @entity80 , killing 52 people			1
" there are many types of drug trafficking , " @entity55 said			0
" this one is particularly toxic			0
" @entity86 , a professor of government at the @entity88 and co-author of " @entity91 's men , " which focuses on @entity5 , said in an e-mail that while @entity69 and @entity7 authorities have zeroed in on @entity5 , other factors have helped fracture the group			1
among them is @entity5 ' massive expenditures on weaponry to defend their turf			2
" over the years , @entity5 have evolved from a vertical organization with effective command - and - control mechanisms to @entity111 's - like franchises , " @entity86 said , explaining that as @entity5 ' leadership has been eviscerated , the group has relied on groups of " green - as - grass newcomers " who lack the operational savvy of the original @entity5			1
as have the authorities , the @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 cartels have all turned their attention to taking down the group , and @entity5 have chosen weak allies in the @entity120 and @entity121 , @entity86 said			1
the group also lost a key military strategist in @entity124 , who was killed by @entity125 last year , he said			2
former operatives have turned informant , @entity86 said , and @entity124 's ally , @entity135 " @entity127 ( now imprisoned in @entity16 ) , has accused @entity35 of " betraying his comrades in order to get better treatment for his family members captured in the @entity69			1
" @entity55 said many of the top - and second - tier leaders have been killed or arrested , also assisting in @entity5 ' fragmentation			1
@entity5 got their start as enforcers for one of @entity16 's oldest drug trafficking groups , the @entity139 , which traces its roots to the 1930s , said @entity147 anthropology professor @entity146 , who has written extensively on drug trafficking			1
the cartel was in disarray until the 1990s , when @entity154 , now imprisoned in the @entity69 , " made the @entity139 really super-powerful again , bringing huge loads of cocaine and other drugs into the @entity69 , " @entity146 said			1
by the late 1990s , @entity155 found himself at the cartel 's helm			0
" one of the most innovative tactics he used was co-opting a lot of highly trained military people			0
he was the first to openly recruit a @entity163 - like enforcement wing , " @entity146 said			0
" ( @entity164 ) were violent before , but then all of a sudden you have this trained paramilitary wing			0
killings were posted on the @entity169			0
leaving bodies and body parts in public places was a hallmark of @entity5 ' work , as was torture , especially dismemberment			2
or as @entity146 put it , " chopping up bodies as you would meat in a butcher shop			0
" theories abound about what led to the rift between the @entity139 and @entity5 , but several years ago -- @entity146 estimates it was about 2008 -- @entity5 broke off , " unleashing a tremendous wave of violence all over @entity16			1
" where other cartels , including the rival @entity188 , took part in a " patronage network , " paying police and government officials for their assistance in illicit enterprise , @entity5 preferred brutal takedowns of entire towns and regions , @entity146 said			2
" ( @entity5 ) therefore became public enemy no. 1 in @entity16 , " he said			1
they did n't stick solely to drug trafficking , either			0
their criminal resume includes extorting business for " protection fees , " charging other cartels for passing through their extensive territory , gun and human smuggling , kidnapping and money laundering			1
" @entity210 was a key tool for these guys to obtain all kinds of streams of income , " @entity55 said			0
their turf includes the lucrative drug plaza of @entity34 and southern @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and parts of @entity113 , @entity224 and @entity226 states , @entity86 said			0
with @entity35 's capture , several scenarios could enfold			0
his brother could take over , but @entity146 , @entity55 and the geopolitical intelligence firm , @entity230 , all question whether he has the respect or capabilities to head a national criminal outfit			0
" i would n't bet on that , " @entity55 said			0
more violent prospects include the @entity113 and @entity114 cartels attacking @entity5 in @entity238 in a bid to control @entity34 , " the crown jewel for cross-border flows for goods , services , guns , money , drugs and illegal aliens , " @entity86 said			1
also , the professor postulated the @entity139 could move to take over the @entity250 and @entity251 border crossings			2
another possibility is that the small gangs helping to fill out @entity5 ' ranks could begin operating independently or be absorbed by other cartels , several experts said			2
this would be similar to what happened after @entity259 broke up the @entity261 and @entity262 cartels			0
" ' @entity263 ' emerged that were violent and successful in shipping cocaine , but did not pose a threat to the nation - state , " @entity86 said			0
whatever happens , do n't expect much impact on the @entity69 side of the border , said author @entity271 , whose books on the @entity7 drug war include " @entity274 : @entity275 and the @entity277 's @entity276			1
" " his arrest means nothing , " @entity271 said			0
" none of the arrests under ( former president felipe ) @entity283 affected the shipment of drugs to the @entity69 or the price of drugs in the @entity69 " added @entity55 , " to affect the volume of drugs going into the @entity69 , there needs to be a reduction in the demand for drugs in the @entity69 "			1

arrest could mean death knell for @entity5 , *ex-intelligence* executive says
@entity5 - @entity139 split unleashed " violence all over @entity16 "
death of @entity69 agent , *casino* fire brought added @entity69 , @entity7 focus on group
@entity5 include gun and human smuggling , kidnapping on criminal resume
