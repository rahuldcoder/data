-- he 's an internationally recognized journalist , doctor and nonfiction author			1
now , for the first time , he 's dipping his scalpel into fiction writing			1
dr. @entity7 , @entity0 chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon , has written a novel that 's being turned into a tv pilot			1
@entity7 and tv writer @entity11 ( of " @entity13 " and " @entity14 " fame ) are the executive producers of the show , " @entity17			1
" @entity18 , a division of @entity0 's parent company @entity19 , ordered the pilot			1
based on the book " @entity22 , " the show follows five doctors at a fictional hospital called @entity17 as they face the realities of having made mistakes			1
on tuesday , the book releases to the public			1
here 's the first chapter			1
@entity7 had been thinking about writing this book for more than a decade			1
he wanted to incorporate an aspect of hospital life that many patients do n't know about : the morbidity and mortality ( @entity37 ) meetings , where doctors gather to talk openly about the mistakes they 've made			1
i recently chatted with @entity7 about the book			1
here is an edited transcript : @entity0 : was there a message you wanted to get across with this book ? @entity7 : in fiction books , there is n't a particular agenda			1
what i will say , though , is that there has been an erosion of the patient - physician relationship over the past couple of decades			2
there 's been an increasing lack of trust			1
doctors and the whole health care structures are seeing so many patients on any given day , there 's so little interaction			1
i think that the idea that you 'd actually know who your doctors are , that you 'd know who the people are that you 're essentially trusting with your life or the life of a loved one , it seems like that would be a no - brainer			2
but the reality is , people know more about their school systems , and where their grocery store is , than they do their hospitals and their doctors			0
i do n't think there 's a message here , except it 's going to provide an insight into the people and the hospitals that , when you need them , become the most important thing in your life			1
and there 's a chance to see what i 've seen over the last 20 years about how some of that works			1
@entity0 : why did you decide to write this as a work of fiction ? @entity7 : this is a hard book to write as a nonfiction			1
you are dealing with some sensitive , touchy subjects within medicine			0
you have to be sensitive to the people who live and breathe in that world and will continue to do so long after this book comes out			1
it 's fiction based on real things			1
@entity0 : how did the process compare with writing your nonfiction books ? @entity7 : nonfiction is more difficult			1
i think especially with medical nonfiction , you spend so much of your time sourcing material			1
while i had narratives and stories that would sort of make the points in " @entity118 " or " @entity119 , " the creative part of it was superseded by essentially trying to write a term paper in terms of how you source things			0
you really spend a lot of time just doing research			0
with this : it 's harder to organize			2
it was challenging at the beginning to forecast the narrative , the beginning , middle and end			0
once i had that down , i enjoyed the writing of it , once the beginning organizational part was done			0
@entity0 : what 's the difference between @entity37 meetings and other ways that mistakes get addressed ? @entity7 : there 's a whole system that exists in our society if a mistake is made and a patient has been harmed			1
there 's a system within hospital itself			1
but this is n't about that			0
this is about the doctors really holding each other accountable			0
so this is saying : ' we can do better			0
those types of mistakes are n't made in this hospital			2
here 's how we allow them to never happen again			2
' it 's not to say that it 's fuzzy edges and soft lines			2
these meetings can be vicious , in some ways , far worse than what the punitive systems that exist have to offer			0
getting sued or being disciplined by the administration may pale in comparison to being held accountable by your colleagues , the people whom you respect and helped train you and all that sort of stuff			0
yes , certainly there 's an accountability that exists in our society			2
but this is about a secretive meeting that takes place in hospitals with a different purpose			0
the purpose is to advance medicine and advance science			0
as awkward and unsettling as it may be , a lot of those advances are sometimes made because of mistakes , and the worst possible thing is that nobody learns from the mistakes			0
@entity0 : tell us about some of the characters in " monday mornings			1
" @entity7 : there 's five main characters			1
these characters are all composites of people i 've known in my own life			0
they all work at the same hospital , but not necessarily the same department			1
one of my main characters is @entity214 -- this is a guy who is a neurosurgeon in a hospital			2
his brother died of brain tumor when he was young			0
his sister was shot in a convenience store robbery and is in a vegetative state			0
the thing he remembers beyond the tragedy of losing his sibling is how the doctors , when his brother died , did not come out and tell his family			0
they sent a social worker to go do it			0
as often happens in the case of couples that lose a child , his parents got divorced			0
so he had two goals in life when he realized he could become a doctor : 1 ) he wanted to become better neurosurgeon than the one that took care of his brother , and 2 ) he also wanted to make it so that , under his watch , a family would never get treated the way his family was when they lost one of their children			0
you do n't know this when you meet him			0
he 's a very good surgeon			2
he has some almost stereotypical qualities about who he is			0
he 's not the nicest guy in the world in most situations , at least to his colleagues			2
when it comes to families , there 's nobody better			2
he 's the best guy in the hospital			1
when he makes a medical mistake , you get a sense of just what prism through which he sees that mistake			2
he sees it through : this is my life 's calling			2
this is all i was supposed to do : to save people that other people could not			0
in this case , he did n't			0
@entity0 : how 's the tv pilot going ? @entity7 : we 'll have a pilot done hopefully by may			1
we 're feeling very good about it			0
@entity11 [ @entity11 ] wrote the pilot , but it 's very true to the book , and i think it 's going to be great			1
we 've got great actors			0
the cast includes @entity293 ( " @entity297 " ) , @entity294 ( " @entity298 " ) , @entity295 ( " @entity299 " ) , @entity300 ( " @entity301 " ) , @entity302 ( who plays @entity304 on " @entity305 " ) and @entity296 ( " @entity306 " )			0
it 's being shot in @entity308			2
@entity0 : will the show 's story extend beyond the plot of the book ? @entity7 : the show is based on the book			1
the theme of the book is the theme of the show as well			1
you probably have half a season worth of stuff in terms of storyline			0
we 're going to be continuously creating storylines and doing things with our characters			0
it 's the same theme , same characters , but obviously a show is going to have a lot longer life than the book itself			1
@entity0 : how do you have time for all of this ? @entity7 : when it comes to the tv show , i 'm not a scripted drama guy			1
i 'm not literally scouting out the shots			0
i helped with the casting only because the characters are my characters			0
out of all the things that i do , that 's not something i 'm going to be spending a lot of time on			2
for me , it 's all along the spectrum of similar things			2
it 's all medicine and health related			2
i practice as a doctor , report stuff as a journalist , this was a fictional way of doing some of the same stuff			0
i do n't see these as so disparate that your mind is just spinning all the time .			0
