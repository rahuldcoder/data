( @entity0 -- my ancestors came from @entity3 , so i 'm partial to that corner of @entity5			1
but even if you 're not from @entity8 stock , do n't miss the fjords			1
on the @entity10 , @entity3 shows off its natural beauty			1
from @entity13 , northern @entity5 's most scenic train takes you up and over the country 's mountainous spine and into the land of shiplap dreams			1
the tourist board calls it " @entity3 in a nutshell " and that 's just what it gives you			1
frankly , if you go to @entity13 and do n't get out to the fjords , you should have your passport revoked			1
@entity3 's greatest claim to scenic fame is its deep and lush saltwater inlets			1
@entity10 , @entity3 's longest ( 120 miles ) and deepest ( more than a mile ) , is tops			1
@entity10 offers @entity3 's best combination of scenic wonder and accessibility			1
for the best one - day look at fjords , follow the @entity23 's series of well - organized train , ferry , and bus connections that puts this beautiful fjord country spread - eagle on a scenic platter			1
ambitious and energetic travelers can see the whole shebang in a day ; with more time or less energy , consider an overnight along the fjord or in @entity46			1
allow about $ 200 to take the nutshell route from @entity13 to @entity46 on your own ( cheaper if you have a railpass )			1
book your reservations for the train at least a week in advance ( from the @entity55 , dial 011 - 47 - 81 50 08 88 )			1
or you can take a package tour with @entity57 for about the same price and less hassle			1
@entity60 and august are the best months to go			1
the @entity62 route starts with a spectacular train ride , leaving @entity13 at about 8 a.m. for @entity46			1
your camera button will click like a castanet as the train roars over @entity3 's mountainous spine			2
the barren , windswept heaths , glaciers , deep forests , countless lakes , and a few rugged ski resorts create a harsh beauty			2
the railroad is an amazing engineering feat. completed in 1909 , it 's 300 miles long and peaks at 4,266 feet , which , at this @entity80 latitude , is far above the tree line			2
you 'll go under 18 miles of snow sheds , over 300 bridges , and through 200 tunnels in just less than seven hours			2
at @entity87 , a 12 - mile spur line drops you 2,800 breathtaking feet in 55 minutes to the village of @entity90 on @entity10			2
this is a party train			2
the engineer even stops the train for photographs at a particularly picturesque waterfall			2
while most " @entity3 in a @entity23 " tourists zip immediately from the train onto the scenic fjord boat in @entity90 , those with time enjoy an overnight stop on the fjord			2
@entity90 is a handy tourist depot with several simple hotels			2
@entity104 , a few miles north of @entity90 , is more of a town			0
it 's famous for producing some of @entity3 's sweetest " geitost " -- goat cheese			0
@entity104 has as many goats as people ( 1,900 )			0
nearly every train arriving in @entity90 connects with a bus or boat to @entity104 , also on @entity10			0
while nearby @entity46 is famous for its rain -- more than six feet a year -- @entity10 is a relative sun belt , with only two feet of rain a year			0
the train from @entity87 to @entity90 is quite scenic , but the ride does n't do the view justice			0
for the best single day 's activity from @entity90 , take the train to @entity122 ( halfway back up to @entity87 ) , then hike or bike ( rentable from the @entity90 tourist office ) the gravelly construction road back down to @entity90			0
bring a picnic and your camera			0
from @entity90 , " @entity131 " catch the most scenic of fjord cruises			0
sightseeing boats leave throughout the day			0
for 90 minutes , camera - clicking tourists scurry on the drool - stained deck like nervous roosters , scratching fitfully for a photo to catch the magic			0
waterfalls turn the black - rock cliffs into a bridal fair			0
you can nearly reach out and touch the sheer , towering walls			0
the ride is one of those fine times , like being high on the tip of an @entity148 , when a warm camaraderie spontaneously combusts among the strangers who came together for the experience			0
the boat takes you up one narrow arm ( @entity154 ) and down the next ( @entity155 ) to the nothing - to - stop - for town of @entity157 , where waiting buses shuttle you back to the main train line at @entity161			0
from @entity161 , carry on into @entity46 for a short evening visit			0
@entity46 , @entity3 's second city and historic capital , is an entertaining place			0
you can finish the day there by browsing the touristy but fun wharf area , or zipping up the funicular to the top of 1,000 - foot - tall " @entity169 for city and fjord views			0
then spend the night in @entity46 -- or , for maximum efficiency , catch the overnight train back to @entity13			0
back in @entity13 's station , as you yawn and stretch and rummage around for a cup of morning coffee , it 'll hit you : you were gone for 24 hours , experienced the fjord wonder of @entity5 , and saw @entity46 to boot			1
