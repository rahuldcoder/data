now ... the cheese dust ? in the march issue of @entity7 , first lady @entity5 says she 's banished processed foods from her family 's table in an effort that began nearly a decade ago			1
that 's when , acting on the behest of the family 's personal chef , she exiled the venerable boxed macaroni and cheese to the @entity5 scrap heap of history			1
" he said , ' there 's nothing wrong with mac and cheese , but it 's got to be real food , ' " @entity7 quoted @entity5 as saying in an article celebrating the fifth anniversary of her let 's move fitness initiative			1
" so my oldest daughter ( @entity30 ) , who was probably 8 at the time , he took a block of cheese , and he said , ' if you can cut this cheese up into the powder that is the cheese of the boxed macaroni and cheese , then we 'll use it			2
' " " she sat there for 30 minutes trying to pulverize a block of cheese into dust , " @entity5 said			1
suffice to say , it did n't work			0
" and from then on , we stopped eating macaroni and cheese out of a box , because cheese dust is not food , as was the moral of that story , " she said			1
the family went on to eliminate all traces of processed foods from their diet : " all those packaged lunches , all of the canned juices , " she said			1
" we started using fresh - squeezed juice and added more water into their diet , " she told the magazine			0
" so when the kids were thirsty , we would even mix water in juice just to dilute it so it would get them out of that habit of wanting that sugary taste			0
and the kids adapted to the changes very quickly			0
" since becoming first lady , @entity5 has been a vocal proponent of fitness and healthy eating			2
in addition to the @entity72 campaign , she oversaw the creation of a vegetable garden at the @entity75 and championed 2010 legislation that increased subsidies for school meals and gave the federal government more authority to set standards for fold sold in school vending machines			0
while well - received by many health and fitness advocates , the first lady 's statements at times have drawn groans or worse , and the cooking light article is no different			2

" of course , all of the @entity30 ' efforts to get their daughters to eat more healthfully could soon go up in a cloud of college dining hall fast - food glory			0
@entity30 , whose failed cheese dust experiment helped set the family on their processed - food - free journey , is about to go off to college , her dad noted recently			1
" i joke with @entity30 and @entity127 , because @entity30 is now at the age where she 's starting to look at colleges , and i said , ' these days , i hear everybody is looking for fancy gyms and gourmet food and really spiffy dorms , ' " he said last week .			2
