-- far too often , children with developmental disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of their observable behavior , slotted into broad diagnostic pigeonholes and provided generalized treatments that may not always meet their specific needs			1
for instance , children are sometimes assigned with broad - spectrum labels of " autism " or " attention deficit disorder " after a single psychological assessment and are provided expensive therapies or prescribed strong medications with serious , long - term side effects			1
this incomplete diagnosis and / or overmedication can leave their underlying problems untreated and left to worsen , and compound the frustration of parents and child			2
such an approach is analogous to trying to diagnose and treat a heart problem without ever doing a chest x-ray or @entity26 to looking at the heart			0
the essence of my talk at @entity31 was simple : to diagnose any brain - related developmental disorder , it is crucial to look at the brain			1
looking at behavior alone can provide an incomplete or misleading picture			2
moreover , when looking at the brain , it is important to go beyond its structure to its function			1
this is because often in cognitive disorders , the structure of the brain is intact , but its function is compromised			1
abnormalities in brain function have traditionally been detected using electroencephalography ( @entity47 ) , which involves the measurement of the ongoing electrical activity generated by the brain			1
@entity47 appears as a pattern of spikes and waves that are visually inspected to detect these abnormalities			0
however , following more recent advances in technology , a pioneering @entity47 system known as @entity56 ( @entity56 ) has been developed at @entity57 by neurologist dr. @entity58			2
this system adds complex display schematics and statistical analyses to the traditional @entity47 recordings to provide more information about brain dysfunction			2
for instance , not only can beam map the patient 's @entity47 recordings onto schematic @entity69 maps of the head , but it can also estimate whether the @entity47 is outside the normal bounds for a child 's age			2
this is achieved using a technique known as @entity76 , which compares the patient 's eeg to a reference database of normal @entity79			2
the proprietary database contains @entity47 data on more than 2,000 fully screened , healthy subjects , making beam a unique and powerful investigative tool in the diagnosis of various neurological disorders			1
for instance , when using @entity56 we have found that many children who are diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from virtually undetectable brain seizures that are presenting with autism - like symptoms			0
indeed , there is increasing evidence that one - third to one - half of children with autism may be prone to abnormal seizure - like activity in their brains , and up to one - third of children with autism may develop epilepsy by the time they reach adolescence			0
in some cases , this seizure - like activity may merely be a consequence of the underlying neurological problem that is causing autism ; in others , it may be comorbid ( co-existent ) with autism			0
however , in yet other cases , such as the one i described at the @entity31 conference , we found that the seizures are in fact the cause of the children 's symptoms and , when treated , the level and speed of recovery in these children has been remarkable			0
since some of these children 's symptoms ( staring into space or being unresponsive ) were mistaken for those of autism during behavioral testing , we would never have identified the epileptiform seizure activity in their brains without an @entity47 test			1
of course , many children diagnosed with autism and other developmental disorders do not have any seizures or abnormal @entity47 activity			0
and for some who do , this may not be the cause of all their symptoms			0
hence , i do not suggest that neurophysiological tests like @entity56 should be used as a replacement for behavioral tests , but that they should be used in conjunction with such tests , to triangulate more accurately the cause of the child 's symptoms , and to ensure more targeted and effective treatments or therapies			0
since my talk at @entity31 , i have been working on making @entity57 's @entity56 system more widely available , from the @entity151 to @entity152			1
indeed , after the recent deluge of enquiries i have received , we are working on this with greater urgency			0
my goal is to have numerous systems worldwide that are fully accessible and affordable to all families			0
until then , it is important for parents to understand that even a standard digital @entity47 test conducted by a local physician could help reveal whether seizure activity in the brain is contributing to their child 's symptoms			1
indeed , my talk at @entity31 was not intended so much to highlight a particular system or technology as it was to emphasize the importance of a particular approach to these disorders			0
that approach is simple : to diagnose a developmental disorder accurately , we should look at the brain directly			1
or , to recall a phrase i use when testing children : " when we put this magic cap on you , your brain can finally talk to us , and we can finally listen ! " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

@entity183 says too often learning disorder diagnosis based only on behavior
she says it 's important to look at brain activity and function
new technology is making it easier to *monitor* brain function
