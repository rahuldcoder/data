-- it 's not the first time @entity3 has had to ask for help -- but it must be one of the most embarrassing			1
twice a champion of golf 's biggest tournaments , the reformed alcoholic -- who has also battled gambling and weight problems -- is seeking advice after the worst round of his professional career			1
the 47 - year - old carded 19 - over - par 90 in friday 's second round of the @entity17 's @entity16 , including an octuple - bogey 12 at the 16th hole of the @entity21 course at @entity23 resort in @entity24			1
whereas the younger @entity3 , known as " @entity25 " among other nicknames , might 've stormed off without a word , or broke a club or two , this time the veteran @entity29 was happy to explain his woes			1
" when you 've got the yips , it 's no fun , " he said , referring to the 37 putts he needed over the 18 holes			2
he three - putted three times , and needed four at the fourth hole			2
" when you play a putt to go left - to - right and push it three feet right , you look like an idiot			2
" when i shorten my stroke , i get quick and miss it left			0
when i try to do my normal long stroke , i come up and push it			0
i 've never had that problem before			0
" however , it was not just the short game that let " @entity48 down			0
known for his " grip it and rip it " approach , he hit three balls into the pond at the 16th , and then shanked a seven - iron " dead right			1
" " it was just one of those days when nothing went right , " said @entity3 , who eclipsed his previous worst round of 89 at the 2008 @entity58			1
" you hit it in the bunker , it buries			0
hit it in the fairway , you 're in a divot			0
i even hit it in a divot in a bunker			0
" @entity3 also defended himself on @entity71 , where he has 368,000 followers , after one tweet that showed a screenshot of his scorecard claimed he was " way too drunk			2
" " have n't drank in six years , be nice , " he responded			0
@entity3 won the 1991 @entity77 in his debut season on the main @entity29 circuit , and followed that up with his second major success at the 1995 @entity58			1
however , his off - course problems were reflected in his declining playing fortunes and these days he has to rely on sponsor exemptions to enter @entity17 events			1
he has not played at the masters since 2006 , but is often seen selling his merchandise outside the hallowed @entity89 club			0
@entity3 is still a draw at overseas tournaments , but had trouble at the @entity93 when he walked off the course after hitting seven balls into water hazards			2
the @entity17 's website reported that @entity3 had been considering trying to get entry into a secondary tour event in @entity100 in two weeks , but will instead seek help with his putting " yips			1
" " i 've got to call somebody that 's had them , " he said .			0
