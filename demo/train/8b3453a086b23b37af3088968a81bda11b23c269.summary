being a highly productive , contributing member of society demands effort and commitment			2
it requires sacrifice and a passion for teamwork			2
basically , i 'm not interested			0
on the other hand , i 'm wildly enthusiastic about napping			0
which does literally nothing for the betterment of the world , unless you take solace in the fact that at least i 'm not walking around touching things			0
but i really do enjoy my regularly scheduled naps			0
so much so , in fact , that my close friends know not to call between 2 and 4 p.m. on the weekends			0
the " baby " is sleeping			0
and that 's why i was rather excited this week to discover all the social media buzz over the amazing new @entity25			1
essentially , it 's a soft , padded tube in which you can bury your entire head to take a nap , so long as you do n't mind burying your entire head in a soft , padded tube			1
of course , there 's really no way you should already know whether this is something you like			1
" what ? you have n't tried ? " the creators actually call it a microenvironment , but i think that sounds a little too much like they 're describing the inside of my colon			1
which is a little unsettling			0
you know , as opposed to a soft ... padded ... tube			0
ok , so it 's pretty much the same thing			1
regardless , i did some serious soul searching -- i pictured myself wearing it in public situations like at an airport or a bris -- and decided that , yes , i 'm totally down for living in this tube			0
it 's so stupendous ! seriously			1
and as a bonus , in addition to the small face opening for breathing , the hand holes at the top kind of make you look like @entity60 from " @entity61			0
" " it 's a nap ! " the @entity25 was conceptualized by the @entity65 design duo @entity63 , who wanted to find a creative way to provide people with the health and productivity benefits commonly associated with power napping			1
power napping is a lot like normal napping , only when you 're done with a power nap , you 're expected to actually do stuff			2
when you wake up from a normal nap , it 's completely ok to glance around the room , confirm that @entity81 riding a unicorn was just an amazing dream , and then roll over to fall back asleep			1
but the @entity25 is specifically designed for those shorter periods of rest -- the power naps -- and the creators boast that their invention allows you to sleep anytime , anywhere by creating a " little private space within a public one , to relax and unwind			1
" right now , the product is in the middle of a one - month run on the crowd - funding website @entity93 , where the creators were hoping to raise $ 70,000 to get the project off the ground			1
the current haul is more than $ 130,000			1
which according to my calculations is ... more			0
perhaps this says a lot about people 's attitudes toward napping and the importance of taking a little siesta during the busy workday			2
the official sales pitch for the @entity25 even claims that a 20 - minute power nap can increase productivity by 37 %			1
amazing ! i can only dream of all the things i would get done at the office if i actually worked at 37 % productivity			1
and to think , all i need is a quick nap as soon as i get to my desk			2
" let 's start the morning meeting			2
where 's @entity121 ? " " wearing his tube , mentally preparing to give us slightly less than 50 %			1
" by and large , the @entity25 seems like a great idea			1
it has a place for your hands			0
but the big question is whether people will actually wear it in public			0
and we really ca n't say yes or no based on what i would do , since a better assessment would come from somebody who actually has the ability to feel shame			0
nevertheless , i 'm still hoping to get my hands on one of these to give it a proper test drive			0
but , until then , if you need me , i 'll be sleeping under my desk			0
" let 's start the morning meeting			2
where 's @entity121 ? " " who cares			2

" @entity158 " is @entity155 's weekly , *offbeat* look at *stories* *trending* on the web
this week , @entity160 *ponders* the appeal of the viral @entity25
the project has raised more than $ 130,000 on @entity93
creators claim a nap with the pillow makes you 37 % more *efficient*
