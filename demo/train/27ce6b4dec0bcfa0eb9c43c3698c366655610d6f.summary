-- an eighth case of meningitis has been reported at @entity4 , the school said friday , the latest in a string of cases reported this year			1
" health officials will be conducting tests to determine if this latest case is related to the seven cases of meningitis associated with the university since march , " university spokesman @entity7 said in an e-mail			1
a female student at the @entity18 - based @entity17 school was taken to a local hospital thursday after developing symptoms wednesday night and is receiving treatment			0
all seven other cases of meningitis found at @entity4 since march were caused by a rare meningococcal bacteria known as serotype @entity26 @entity4 said monday that the school was preparing to provide a vaccine to protect against this strain of meningitis , pending final approval from the @entity31			1
the vaccine for meningitis b is not licensed in the @entity34 , but it has been approved in @entity35 and @entity36			2
if the @entity31 approves , the vaccine would be recommended for all undergraduates and graduate students living in dormitories , as well as other members of the university community with conditions where the spleen is compromised , or certain other immune system disorders			1
that would apply to about 5,000 undergraduates and 550 graduate students in dorms , @entity7 said			0
additionally , around half a dozen people with conditions that fall under the recommendation would also be affected , although there may be more who have not yet disclosed their conditions , he said			0
@entity18 state law requires all students at @entity4 living in dormitories to receive a different meningitis vaccine , one that is licensed in the @entity34			1
that vaccine protects against some other strains , but not serotype b bacteria			0
two doses of the unlicensed vaccine -- called @entity65 and made by @entity66 -- are required to protect individuals against meningitis @entity4 hopes to make the first two doses of the vaccine available in early december , and the second in february			1
also this week , the @entity71 , @entity72 , reported that three students were being treated for meningococcal disease , and that their cases were caused by type b bacteria -- the same bacteria strain causing the @entity4 outbreak			1
however , no link has been found between the @entity81 cases and those at @entity4 , the @entity83 said			1
what is meningitis b ? meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord , known as the meninges			0
there are two forms of meningitis : bacterial and viral			0
the bacterial form is rare in the @entity34 , and the @entity98 bacterial strains are even more rare			0
meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing , coughing , sharing drinks and living in close quarters , such as in dormitories , according to the @entity18 state health department			2
symptoms can include stiff neck , headache , fever , vomiting , rashes , sensitivity to light and confusion			0
untreated , the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment , brain damage , limb amputations and death			0
antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis " should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15 % , although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly , " according to the @entity31			1
in 2012 , there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the @entity34 , according to the @entity31			1
of those , 160 were group @entity26 school activities continue several students told @entity0 that their peers are not overly afraid of getting meningitis , but that it 's definitely a topic of conversation			2
" i think students do know that it is an important and fatal issue that is spreading on campus - and each student individually decides to what degree to protect themselves , " @entity139 , a junior , said in an e-mail			0
he and others said they probably would sign up for the meningitis b vaccine if it becomes available			2
" if the vaccine was offered and if there is enough scientific evidence proving its effectiveness , i would take it to reduce risk of infection , " he said			0
@entity156 break at @entity4 begins tuesday after classes , and the semester at " @entity159 " resumes december 2			2
" at this time , the @entity31 and state health officials recommend that travel plans and activities on the @entity4 campus continue as planned , and the surrounding community can continue to attend events on the @entity4 campus , " @entity7 said			1
