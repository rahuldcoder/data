@entity0 -- a @entity5 grand jury is investigating the beating death of a man in @entity0 's @entity8 as a possible hate crime , @entity3 deputy commissioner @entity2 told @entity1 tuesday			2
@entity10 , 62 , was pronounced dead monday , five days after being beaten by a man who allegedly said , " i 'm gon na punch out the first white guy i see , " according to police commissioner @entity13			1
witnesses said the suspect , identified by police as @entity17 , 40 , struck @entity10 so hard that bystanders could hear the force of his head hitting the cement			1
two other men were also assaulted in the september 4 attack as they tried to help @entity10 , police said			2

no additional charges were filed , but the grand jury is considering evidence being gathered by the @entity3 's hate crimes task force and may decide to upgrade the charge to a hate crime , which could include manslaughter			2
" the murder or manslaughter charge is a charge that requires far more on the part of the prosecution to prove his intent to inflict that type of injury , " @entity17 's attorney said			1
" they must show intent to cause serious injury ...			0
it needs to be explored more as to whether they have enough evidence to prove intent to kill based on one punch			0
