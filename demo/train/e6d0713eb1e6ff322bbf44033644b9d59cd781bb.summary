@entity0 -- @entity5 staff sgt. @entity4 will be charged with 17 counts of murder and six counts of assault and attempted murder related to a march 11 shooting spree in @entity12 , a senior @entity3 official said thursday			1
the charges are expected to be announced friday			0
the official could not explain why the count is now 17 , when 16 have been reported killed in the incident			0
@entity17 ' lawyer , @entity16 , told @entity1 that he did not respond to leaks and that he would not comment before seeing the charges against his client			0
even then , he said , " there 's probably not much to say			0
" still , @entity22 predicted the case -- whenever it comes to trial -- is going to be " extremely difficult " for the prosecution			0
" they have no murder scene , no forensics , " the lawyer said thursday night from outside his @entity29 office			0
" i 'm going to make them prove every claim			1
" military law experts acknowledge proving the case may be hard , especially given that there are no autopsies to help prove the cause of death -- in large part because those killed were buried quickly , in accordance with @entity45 tradition -- and witnesses may not willingly fly from @entity12 to the @entity3 to testify			1
@entity3 officials have alleged that @entity48 carried out the killings alone in two neighboring villages in the @entity52 district of @entity54 province , in southern @entity12			1
@entity48 was flown out of @entity12 last week and is being held at @entity55 , @entity56			1
2 kids die in @entity54 suicide bombing @entity12 are insisting that the suspect be returned to @entity12 to face trial , with villagers and lawmakers questioning the @entity3 military 's account of what happened			1
but a military official said in @entity12 on sunday that @entity48 will be tried in the @entity3			1
the rampage has strained already tense @entity3 - @entity12 relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull @entity3 troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal			1
@entity12 president @entity72 has demanded that troops withdraw from villages in his nation and return to their bases , saying relations between the two countries were " at the end of their rope			1
" on wednesday , @entity12 's foreign minister called for a " swift and transparent investigation " into the killings of 16 men , women and children			1
but @entity1 legal contributor and defense attorney @entity87 told @entity1 's " @entity93 " that the case against the lone suspect in their deaths , @entity48 , may be largely circumstantial			1
" there were admissions allegedly made by @entity48 to some of his fellow soldiers , in which he claimed at least that he was n't shooting women and children , ( and rather ) was shooting men of military age , " @entity87 said			2
" now , that would be an admission by him that would link him to the crime scene			0
if they then link his gun to the specific victims , then they easily make a connection and they can prove their case			2
" @entity87 said he believed prosecutors would seek the death penalty against @entity48 , " because this is one of the biggest alleged massacres in memory			2
" " you have the diplomatic and political problems that are being caused by this crime , " @entity87 said			0
" @entity12 citizens will be looking , saying , ' is the @entity3 seeking justice in this case ? ' " but he said that even if prosecutors won a death sentence , it would be unlikely that @entity48 would face execution for years , perhaps decades			1
the accused soldier spoke wednesday night with his wife , their second such conversation since the attack , @entity22 said			0
the couple have two young children together			0
accounts from the military , @entity48 ' family , friends and neighbors paint a portrait of a man who remained committed to serving his country despite wounds he received during three previous combat tours to @entity144 -- including a traumatic brain injury suffered during a vehicle accident there			2
but @entity148 , a former @entity5 captain , told @entity1 that the speculation about whether his injuries or a possible , undiagnosed case of post-traumatic stress disorder contributed to @entity48 ' actions was unfair to other veterans			2
" sgt. @entity48 has been through a lot as a soldier			2
many of us have , " @entity148 said			0
" that is certainly no explanation or excuse for the gross violation of his code of honor , to say the least , and the horrific crimes that he committed			0
" @entity1 's @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0

new : the lack of autopsies and possible lack of witnesses may *hinder* the prosecution
@entity48 ' lawyer says he 's " going to make ( the prosecution ) prove every claim "
the march 11 shooting spree in @entity12 left at least 16 dead
