-- several @entity2 diplomatic cables obtained by @entity3 show growing anxiety among @entity6 officials about citizens getting uncensored online content through @entity9 -- with one @entity11 member reportedly angry to find negative comments about himself online			1
in may 2009 , @entity9 approached the @entity13 in @entity14 , according to one leaked cable , " to discuss recent pressure by the @entity6 government to censor the company 's @entity6 website			1
" @entity6 officials were unhappy that the sanitized google.cn , which was established by @entity9 in 2006 , contained a link to the uncensored google.com , and appeared especially sensitive about the issue because of the imminent 20th anniversary of the @entity26 protests			1
the redacted cable , dated may 18 and written by economic minister counselor @entity28 , says @entity2 diplomats had been told that " the root of the problem was @entity6 's @entity33 member ( name redacted )			1
" later it says : " ( name redacted ) allegedly entered his own name and found results critical of him ...			0
he also noticed the link from @entity20 's homepage to google.com , which ( redacted ) reportedly believes is an ' illegal site			0
' " in another apparent reference to the @entity11 member , the cable says he " believes @entity9 is a ' tool ' of the @entity49 being used to ' foment peaceful revolution in @entity6			1
' " the @entity51 , which had advance access to the cables obtained by @entity3 , says that official is @entity55 , who is a member of the @entity57 's @entity56 -- its highest body -- and runs the @entity11 's propaganda apparatus			1
he subsequently asked three ministries to demand that @entity9 end its " illegal activities , " according to the cable			2
at the same time the @entity6 government was taking commercial steps against @entity9 , instructing state - owned telecom firms to stop doing business with the company -- " a hard blow because mobile internet is @entity9 's ' big bet in @entity6 , ' " the cable added			1
@entity9 refused to remove the link on its @entity6 site , and its lawyers " found no legal basis for @entity6 's demands			1
" the dilemma for the company was that it risked " losing the @entity6 market in retaliation for maintaining its integrity and brand , " the cable said			2
@entity9 had entered the @entity6 market on three principles : it would never disclose to the @entity6 government any personal information about its users or their search habits ; it would always include a disclosure notice to identify when search results had been removed due to censorship ; and it would always provide an uncensored , @entity2 - hosted site , subject to @entity2 law			1
two months later -- in july 2009 -- @entity9 's servers were " virally infected " for 24 hours , amid claims that @entity9 was failing to filter out pornographic sites			0
the embassy 's sources , says a cable from that month , believe " the real reason for the government 's wrath is the company 's refusal to remove a link to google.com from the google.cn website			0
" the cable continued , apparently quoting a @entity9 official , : " ( redacted ) said the negative press coverage and service outages have caused the company to lose market share ...			2
. ( redacted ) said that , faced with the continual difficulties of doing business in @entity6 , the company may even consider pulling out of the market			0
" the attacks on @entity9 servers continued , with the company reporting in january of this year that it had been the victim of a sophisticated cyber attack originating from @entity6			2
it said it also discovered that the " @entity123 accounts of dozens of human rights activists connected with @entity6 were being routinely accessed by third parties			0
" so it began redirecting users visiting @entity20 to the uncensored content of google.com.hk			0
cable written from @entity14 after that cyber attack said : " a well - placed contact claims that the @entity6 government coordinated the recent intrusions of @entity9 systems			1
according to our contact , the closely held operations were directed at the @entity33 level			0
" the cable noted : " an appeal to nationalism seems to be the @entity6 government 's chosen option to counter @entity9 's demand to provide unfiltered web content			1
" an unnamed @entity6 contact " stated that @entity6 operations against @entity9 were ' one hundred percent ' political in nature and had nothing to do with removing @entity9 , with its minority market share , as a competitor to @entity6 search engines			2
" the cable also suggested the move might backfire on the @entity6 authorities , apparently citing a @entity6 contact			2
" all of a sudden , ( redacted ) continued , @entity157 ( a state - owned internet search engine ) looked like a boring state - owned enterprise while @entity9 ' seems very attractive , like the forbidden fruit			0
' " however , the cables suggest that the @entity6 leadership -- and specifically the @entity163 -- believed that the internet in @entity6 could be controlled			0
" through the @entity9 incident and other increased controls and surveillance , like real - name registration , they reached a conclusion : the @entity171 is fundamentally controllable , " according to one source quoted in a cable			0
long before the crisis in 2009 , @entity9 was running into hostility from @entity6 officials			1
in november 2007 , @entity6 asked the @entity2 government to reduce the resolution of @entity180 images of military , nuclear and other sensitive sites in @entity6			2
@entity6 officials warned of " possible ' grave consequences ' if terrorists exploit the information to harm @entity6			1
" a diplomat at the embassy said he would report the @entity6 request to @entity190 , but noted that @entity9 is a private company			2
other cables suggest close ties between @entity6 state enterprises and private hackers in @entity6			0
according to a cable from the @entity2 secretary of state 's office written in june 2009 , the @entity6 information technology @entity202 " has recruited @entity6 hackers in support of nationally - funded ' network attack scientific research projects			1
' " one such enterprise -- @entity204 -- employed " a known @entity6 hacker , @entity206 ( @entity207 and owner of the @entity209 of @entity6 ) , as senior security service engineer to manage security service and training			0
" another was " known to affiliate with @entity214 , one of the few @entity6 hacker groups known to develop exploits to new vulnerabilities in a short period of time			0
" the cable concludes : " while links between top @entity6 companies and the @entity6 are not uncommon , it illustrates the @entity6 's use of its ' private sector ' in support of governmental information warfare objectives , especially in its ability to gather , process , and exploit information			0

@entity3 cables show @entity6 officials were *worried* about @entity9

a @entity2 cable says a @entity6 official believes @entity9 is a " tool " of the @entity2
