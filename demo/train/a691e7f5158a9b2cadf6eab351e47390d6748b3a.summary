@entity0 -- the " party " is over for one of @entity4 's most popular bloggers			2
@entity6 , whose blog has clocked more than 441 million hits in the past five years , announced in his latest post tuesday that he has shut down his literary magazine " party " after publishing just one issue			1
the 28 - year - old best - selling author of novels and professional race car driver is one of the most recognized faces among @entity4 youth			0
his provocative online commentaries on current affairs have also earned him the accolade as one of @entity23 's 100 most influential people of 2009			1
@entity6 said the first issue of " party , " launched in july and sold 1.5 million copies			1
the second issue was due out at end of august			2
" too many people in relevant departments of the @entity4 government are capable of turning literary magazines to cultural relics , " he wrote in his usual sarcastic style			0
" if we ever meet , please tell me what went wrong			0
" at least three things could have gone wrong , according to industry analysts			1
" in @entity4 , the publication , printing and distribution of reading materials require three different sets of licenses and permits , " explained @entity39 , founder of the popular @entity4 media website @entity39			1
" so there are three places they can stop you			0
" @entity6 revealed in the blog the difficulties he repeatedly encountered during his brief magazine - publishing career			1
he ostensibly denied the magazine 's premature death was caused by the state 's propaganda czars , who have in the past censored his writings online			0
the debut issue of " party , " which analysts say had to undergo major cuts to secure government approval , featured novels , essays , poems , photos and cartoons from writers and artists across the @entity4 - speaking world , including a serial penned by @entity6			1
" it got an anti-establishment attitude , a kind of rebellious feel to it , but there was nothing explicitly anti-government , " @entity39 said			1
the long delay in the second issue may have prepared @entity6 's fans for the worst - case scenario			1
among the thousands of comments left below his latest post , there is sadness , sympathy but little surprise			0
" our great motherland can tolerate so much evil but not a magazine , " one reader wrote			0
" i will hold on to my collector 's item ( the first issue ) and wait for the sun to rise again , " said another reader			2
despite his scathing social commentaries , @entity6 is savvy enough to know the limits of what he can and can not write about			2
he famously posted a pair of empty quotation marks in his blog on the day the @entity109 announced its decision to award this year 's peace prize to an imprisoned @entity4 dissident			0
as the government blacked out all news coverage on the @entity117 announcement , @entity6 's blog went on to attract more than 1.3 million views and some 28,000 comments			1
his increasing celebrity at home and abroad , however , seemed to have come short in changing his magazine 's fate in the country 's tightening media environment			0
" the structure in place to control the print media is much stricter than that to control the @entity131 , " said @entity39 , the media analyst			2
" there will be no loosening up until after the next leadership change in 2012			0
" " the @entity117 peace prize made everyone in media even less willing to take risks , " he added			0
that dampens the prospect of @entity6 resurrecting his " party " anytime soon , despite the hope of many of his admirers			2
" i 'm not asking or requesting much -- i just hope that all the people in arts , all the literati , painters , and directors can work in an unregulated and uncensored environment , " @entity6 told @entity1 in an interview last may			1
for now , apparently , he is asking too much .			0
