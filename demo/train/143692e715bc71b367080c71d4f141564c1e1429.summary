@entity1 , @entity0 -- a blogger believed to be the target of the attack that brought down @entity6 has told @entity2 the cyber assault was politically motivated and timed to coincide with the one - year anniversary of the @entity11 - @entity10 conflict			1
@entity13 's @entity6 account was said by @entity15 's security officer to be the target of thursday 's attack			1
" @entity13 " has identified himself to @entity2 as " @entity18 , " and the owner of the @entity6 , @entity15 and @entity21 accounts named by @entity15 's security officer as being the target of a coordinated online attack			1
@entity18 told @entity2 in an e-mail his username is " the name of my home town , the capital of @entity28 ( @entity29 ) written in @entity30 and typed in latin letters			2
" he confirmed he is 34 years old and based in @entity32 , @entity10 , but declined to give further information which may reveal his identity			2
@entity18 told @entity2 his blogposts may have " irritated " someone enough to incite a cyber attack			1
his recent posts include : " how @entity11 was preparing military agression ( sic ) against @entity10 , how they were training soldiers and mobilizing military equipment , what kind of provocations were carried out by the separatists prior to the war			1
" " seems somebody did not like such a chronicle of events , " he told @entity2			0
" i was also writing about all reforms implemented in @entity10 in recent times so that all people outside @entity10 could have proper information			2
" he said the main purpose of his blogs was to promote the resumption of relations between the @entity28 and @entity10 people			2
" i assume the above - mentioned could irritate those who are the authors of the given cyber attack and who will never accept the idea of the @entity62 , independent , democratic and prosperous @entity10 , " he said			1
@entity6 -- a micro-blogging site where users post 140 - character messages to their followers -- went down for around two hours thursday			1
@entity6 said the site 's blackout was caused by a " denial - of - service attack , " which likely means a hacker used a number of infected computers to send enough automated requests to the site to overwhelm it			1
@entity15 and @entity21 , a blogging site , also experienced problems			0
in a statement , @entity15 said the attack , " resulted in a short period of degraded site experience for some visitors			2
no user data was at risk and the matter is now resolved for the majority of users			0
" @entity15 security officer @entity89 told @entity91 news thursday the attack was designed to silence an outspoken blogger known by the username , " cyxymu			1
" " it was a simultaneous attack across a number of properties targeting him to keep his voice from being heard , " @entity89 told @entity91			0
" we 're actively investigating the source of the attacks and we hope to be able to find out the individuals involved in the back end and to take action against them if we can			0
" the @entity10 government has confirmed it 's investigating potential links between the attacks and the user in @entity32 , @entity10 , according to @entity110 , head of the @entity111 at the @entity112			0
although they had no details yet , the spokesman said there were suspicions that the attack may have come from @entity11 , but it will take " some more time " before they could reach any conclusions			2
the @entity112 could not confirm the user 's identity			0
@entity124 , senior technology consultant at computer security firm @entity125 told @entity2 it was unlikely the attacker intended to cripple @entity6 , or to cause widespread disruption			2
" i suspect that whoever did this did n't really want to bring down the likes of @entity6 and cause problems for those other sites , they just wanted that material off because they objected to what it was saying , perhaps for a political reason , " he said			0
@entity124 said thursday 's attacks started with a spamming campaign , called a " joejob , " which is designed to tar a victim 's online reputation by appearing to be the source of a wave of spam			0
" the first thing they did was they started spamming out e-mails , using his name , pointing to web pages he has on those web sites , " @entity146 said			0
" some people have speculated that the ' denial - of - service ' happened after people received these e-mails and clicked on the links			1
but i think that 's poppycock			0
i do n't think many people would have clicked on the links			0
" i think that instead what happened is that whoever had a vendetta against it took it one stage further and decided to launch a ' denial - of - service ' attack against his pages , hoping of course that the pages would be taken down and he 'd been taken off these sites			1
" @entity146 said " denial - of - service " attacks were reported last year when @entity11 deployed troops to @entity180 to repel @entity10 forces			1
" we saw a series of denial of service attacks coming both from @entity11 and from @entity10 a year ago when the conflict took off			1
" read more about recent conflict in the region " it 's not unusual now , when there 's a tense part of the world where there 's conflict happening , for hackers to take matters into their own hands and to take potshots like this , " he said			0
" but in this case , it looks like that collateral damage was all of @entity6			0

@entity15 security officer names " cyxymu " as the target of cyber assault
