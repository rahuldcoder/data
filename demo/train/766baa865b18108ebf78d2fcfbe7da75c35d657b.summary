as i stood in the sweltering heat outside the @entity3 in @entity4 earlier this week , president @entity0 whispered in my ear			1
okay , he did n't exactly whisper , and his words were intended not just for me			0
in one of the most significant addresses of his presidency , @entity0 declared to the world that he would send 3,000 troops to @entity13 - stricken @entity12			1
@entity0 's speech was being piped into my earpiece , and i was about to go on @entity16 when i picked up my phone and emailed my friend @entity18 , the host of the show			1
" @entity22 knows how to fight this disease , " i wrote in the subject line , quoting the words i had just heard @entity0 speak			1
in the body of the email , i wrote to @entity18 , " does it ? " and that 's why i took an airplane to @entity29			2
i want to answer my own question			0
the world knew how to fight @entity13 outbreaks of the past , using a tried and true method i learned about in public health school : isolate sick people , trace their close contacts to see if they get sick , and if they do , isolate them and start the whole process over until the disease burns itself out			1
but does the world know how to stop this @entity13 outbreak ? not to compare a deadly outbreak to a shampoo commercial , so please forgive me , but i think it explains the point : if you 're over 40 , you might remember that old @entity48 shampoo ad -- and they told two friends , and they told two friends , and so on and so on and so on , and the pictures of people replicate so by the end the screen is full of a multitude of little tiny faces who are using @entity48 shampoo			1
that 's what @entity13 has become			2
it has spread exponentially , not linearly			1
there have been nearly 5,000 cases and 2,500 deaths in this outbreak -- that 's more than all other outbreaks combined			2
what you need to know about @entity13 the @entity71 response to the current @entity13 outbreak is surely impressive : 3,000 troops will build 17 hospitals			1
they 'll try to make sure medical supplies are getting in and out smoothly			0
a team of commissioned officers from the @entity78 will staff a 25 - bed hospital for healthcare workers who become ill. but even with these resources , do we know how to stop an outbreak that 's gotten so out of hand ? that 's unlike any other we 've ever seen ? that 's what i 'm trying to find out , and i 'll let you know what i learn			2
so what do you pack to cover an @entity13 outbreak ? thermometers -- because at @entity16 it 's safety first , and we have to take our temperature twice every day and report it back			1
here 's what else you pack : tortillas , because they do n't get squished and they 're slow to grow mold , and peanut butter and jelly tortillas are very handy when you do n't have easy access to reliable food			0
life inside the @entity13 outbreak to prepare emotionally for this trip , i hugged everyone i knew at @entity16 ( and a few i do n't know so well -- sorry )			1
i 'm a hugger , and i wanted to get my hugs out , because there are no hugs on what is in public health parlance a " no - contact deployment			0
" as we boarded the plane from @entity121 to @entity122 , i introduced a public health worker i 'd just met to my producer , @entity124			0
as she stretched her hand out to him she said , " this is our last handshake for this trip			0
and certainly no @entity134 kisses ! " who says public health folks do n't have a sense of humor ? i already knew about the no - contact policy because @entity141 with doctors without @entity143 had told me about @entity144 , a colleague of hers who was in charge of turning away people with @entity13 from the hospital because there 's no more beds			2
he was the gatekeeper , and it was his job to say no. as you might imagine , this assignment was traumatizing			0
when @entity144 had to turn away a woman with her baby and then watch the baby die in front of him , @entity141 could n't hug him			0
she had to console her friend from several feet away			0
as i start this trip , i pray and hope for the people of @entity12 , who have had to suffer so horribly			0
and i wonder -- if the efforts put forth now had been made even just six months ago , maybe then we truly would have known how to fight this disease .			2

@entity13 has spread exponentially , not linearly
@entity16 team on the ground in @entity29 to report on the outbreak
they must take their temperature twice every day as a precaution
@entity0 said earlier this week that the world knows how to fight this disease
