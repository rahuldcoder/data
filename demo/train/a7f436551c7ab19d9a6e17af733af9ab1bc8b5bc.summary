the political strategist spearheading the @entity2 ' campaign effort declared thursday , perhaps not surprisingly , his party will take control of the @entity2 in november , after close to a decade in the minority			1
" we are going to win the @entity2 , i feel very good about that , " @entity7 executive director @entity6 said			1
" these races have been tough			0
they have been a grind			0
but we are seeing movement in the right direction and i feel really good about where we are and think we 're going to take the @entity2 and we 're going to take it on election night , " @entity6 said , predicting the @entity13 will win the 6 seats it needs to control the @entity2 , even if races in @entity16 and @entity17 are close enough to require run - offs in the weeks ahead			1
@entity26 campaign operatives in @entity27 also have expressed confidence in recent days they will hold the @entity2			2
public polls show a number of races shifting -- for and against each party -- as voters become more focused on the candidates , something that is likely to continue for the final three weeks of the campaign			0
no matter who wins , @entity13 should pick up seats and the @entity2 likely will be narrowly divided			1
@entity6 said the credit for the party 's expected success belongs to a disciplined crop of @entity13 challengers and good stewardship from political handlers in @entity27 who provided special debate and speech training for their candidates			1
that training allowed campaigns to avoid the types of gaffes and missteps that derailed several @entity13 candidates in 2012			2
" @entity61 raised $ 6 million because she 's a good candidate , " @entity6 said about the @entity13 @entity57 candidate who is neck in neck in a race @entity26 did n't originally expect to be close			1
" that training , we believe , helps make her that much better a candidate			0
and when our candidates do n't have problems , they do n't say things that reflect poorly on our party or their campaign , it just helps in every category			0
" speaking to reporters in the " @entity75 " of @entity7 headquarters on @entity77 , @entity6 ticked through the most competitive races of the term , saying in each case the @entity13 candidate was poised to win			1
he did acknowledge the @entity2 race has " tightened up " as @entity13 @entity83 battles a well - funded campaign from @entity85 , the daughter of a respected former senator			2
@entity83 has faced criticism for his comments about outsourcing jobs as a businessman			0
the @entity7 recently pumped $ 1.4 million into the race , in part , to help @entity83 get better known in some parts of the state			2
foreign policy , terrorism , @entity96 , and @entity97 are high on voters ' minds , @entity6 said			0
those " constant crises " -- coupled with president @entity103 's high unfavorable ratings -- have created openings for @entity13			1
on @entity96 , @entity6 praised his candidate 's deft handling of a politically sensitive subject			0
" i think our candidates have been thoughtful and they have been cautious to strike a correct tone of concerns of this administration 's handling of it without being outside the lines or going beyond the fact , " he said			0
asked what would happen if @entity26 defied his predication and retained control of the @entity2 , @entity6 quipped , " i 'll be in an unmarked grave in @entity118 , " which , of course , is home to sen. @entity121 , the man who would become majority leader of the @entity2 if the @entity13 wins .			2

@entity7 director feels " very good " about @entity13 @entity2 *victory* in november .
he *attributes* potential @entity13 success to strong candidates like @entity61 in @entity57 .
he said @entity103 's low *approval* ratings also aid @entity13 .
