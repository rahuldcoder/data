the @entity1 is maintaining a list of about two dozen or so top @entity4 operatives in @entity5 and @entity6 that it hopes to target in airstrikes , according to a senior @entity1 official			1
the list essentially amounts to a kill list , since the @entity1 has no troops on the ground in @entity5 or @entity6 to capture @entity4 suspects			1
the no. 1 target on the list is @entity15 , the leader of @entity4			1
one @entity1 official said @entity17 is well - aware the @entity1 is hunting him , so the belief is he is staying out of sight			1
it 's been months since the last intelligence report about where @entity17 is hiding , a senior @entity1 official tells @entity0			1
the @entity1 believes @entity15 knows warplanes are hunting him , so he moves cautiously -- even as his influence has grown beyond @entity6 and @entity5			2
the @entity1 has already killed a dozen or so @entity4 operatives on the list , including an @entity4 chemical weapons expert , the senior official says			1
but others are added to the list as intelligence is gained about their role in @entity4			2
the official strongly emphasized that the command - and - control structure of @entity4 remains murky and more intelligence is needed about the identity of top operatives			2
@entity4 executioners such as so - called @entity38 are still in the @entity1 crosshairs -- but the list focuses on targeting those whose death would broadly hurt @entity4			1
the kill list may now expand as the @entity1 struggles to understand an @entity4 command structure made more confusing by the growth of @entity4 adherents in @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
one analyst cautions those labeling themselves as @entity4 might have very different goals			2
" we have to take each terrorist or cult organization in every country as a separate entity			0
we ca n't look at it as one big group			0
you may miss the most important targets when you are doing that , " said @entity62 , @entity0 military analyst			0
the growing -- and alarming -- reach of @entity4 the execution of @entity69 on the @entity50 coastline underscores the targeting problem			0
the @entity1 wants to identify the killers			0
but the broader worry is @entity4 ' position in @entity50			0
it now has a stronghold in @entity76 and operates across @entity50 coastal areas within reach of southern @entity79 via busy shipping lanes			0
" it 's very difficult to have the same kind of controls over people who might be getting on boats who might be working as stevedores or laborers on ships that are coming into @entity79 ports , " @entity62 said .			0

the no. 1 target on the list is @entity15 , a senior @entity1 official says
the @entity1 has already killed a dozen or so @entity4 operatives on the list , the official says
