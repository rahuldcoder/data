-- the @entity1 , indicating its ban on openly gay members will remain in effect , said it will consider a resolution asking that local units be allowed to determine their own standards			1
an unidentified volunteer leader in the @entity9 introduced the resolution			1
members of a committee have until may 2013 to make a report or recommendation to the group 's @entity14 , said @entity1 spokesman @entity16			1
the debate over the @entity1 ' membership policy is not new			1
" resolutions of this nature are not unique , " @entity16 said on thursday			2
but the issue is back in the headlines because of the resolution , a separate online petition and the formation of a group that wants @entity1 to end its " outdated " policy			1
@entity29 's case has been championed on @entity30 , where the petition has garnered more than 290,000 signatures in support of the @entity1 reversing its position on gay leaders			1
the lesbian @entity37 den leader was dismissed by her local troop earlier this year			1
" this is n't about my sexuality ; this is n't about anybody 's sexuality , " @entity39 said in april			2
" it 's about teaching children to be better adults , and we are n't doing that by teaching them to hate or discriminate			2
" @entity16 said @entity39 understood the policy when she signed up			0
@entity39 told @entity0 's @entity53 on thursday that her partnership was never an issue within the troop			0
" among those supporting @entity39 is @entity60 @entity59 , now 20 , who last month delivered @entity30 signatures to the @entity1 at an @entity63 , @entity64 , meeting			1
author of " my two moms : lessons of @entity74 , @entity75 , and @entity76 , " @entity59 is co-founder of @entity68 , which said it will lead a " respectful , honest " dialogue on the matter			0
" when i was earning my citizenship in the @entity81 merit badge , i learned the importance of standing up for what you believe to be right , " he wrote on the group 's website			0
" by embodying the values of the @entity87 and @entity88 , we believe we can restore the social relevancy of one of this country 's great cultural institutions : the @entity1 , " @entity68 says			1
@entity39 , whose 7 - year - old son is no longer in scouting , told @entity0 's @entity95 that she is optimistic about the resolution			2
" i think that @entity97 gets it , that we are ready for this change , " @entity39 said			0
" and i think that the @entity1 ...			1
along with president @entity101 , they 're evolving and , hopefully , eventually they 'll get there			0
" a 2000 @entity97 @entity105 decision found that a @entity107 law requiring the national organization to readmit an openly gay scoutmaster infringed on the organization 's @entity111 right of expressive association			2
" forcing a group to accept certain members may impair the ability of the group to express those views , and only those views , that it intends to express , " then - chief justice @entity114 wrote at the time			0
he added that the decision was not meant to approve or condemn the @entity1 ' membership policy			1
the @entity1 on thursday clarified its membership policy , saying the introduction of the resolution does not indicate the group is " reviewing a policy			1
" that would occur only if the executive board formally considers the issue , at the earliest next year			0
it said the @entity30 petition is " completely unrelated " to the resolution			2
" there are no plans to change this policy , @entity16 said			0
still , @entity16 said , " any policy of the @entity1 can be changed			1
" the @entity136 organization , which celebrated its 100th birthday in 2010 , says its main focus continues to be mentoring 2.8 million young men and helping them develop life skills			0
" we do not have an agenda on this issue , " @entity16 said			0
" our membership policy is not meant to be a blanket statement on a group of people or social commentary			2
" application forms do not ask information about sexual orientation , the spokesman said , adding that clergy and family are better venues for discussion			0
" this ( scouting ) is not the place to reconcile diverging viewpoints			0
" @entity16 acknowledged that members of the @entity1 ' 300 councils have varying opinions			1
" there has always been an open dialogue about this in scouting			0
" @entity0 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
