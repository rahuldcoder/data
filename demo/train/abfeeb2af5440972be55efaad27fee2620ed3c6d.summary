-- with travel to @entity2 poised to hit all - time highs in 2014 , a drop - off in travel bookings was the last thing the continent 's lucrative safari industry thought it would be facing going into 2015			1
but despite the fact that the main safari destinations in southern and eastern @entity2 are thousands of kilometers from the @entity14 - stricken countries of the west , industry leaders say fears of the disease are keeping tourists away			1
a survey based on feedback from more than 500 safari operators conducted by @entity23 booking company @entity22 found that as of late september , more than half reported a 20 to 70 % decline in bookings			1
" numerous safari tour operators report to us that clients view @entity2 as a single country when it comes to risk assessment , " @entity27 , @entity22 founder , tells @entity0			1
@entity27 says the impact is most noticeable in @entity2 , home to safari hotspots such as @entity37 's @entity36 and @entity39 's @entity38 -- places located nearly 5,000 kilometers from the @entity42 ebola outbreak area			1
" most people do n't realize how vast @entity2 is and that @entity44 and southern @entity2 are just as far from the outbreak area as @entity46 or @entity47 , " says @entity27			1
" all safari countries have enacted strict precautionary measures and as there currently are no @entity14 cases the risk of infection is effectively zero			1
" using music to fight @entity55 in @entity56 convincing clients they 'll be safe @entity58 , a safari specialist with @entity60 , says the @entity14 outbreak has caused a 70 % decrease in inquiries at his company , which offers tours in @entity39 , @entity37 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
" we are still working to try to convince clients they are safe from this disease , but until we see the outbreak come under control my feeling is that it will be a while until things return to normal , " he says			2
@entity76 , founder of it started in @entity2 , which organizes safaris and @entity79 treks in @entity39 and @entity37 , tells a similar story			1
" we did not have any cancellations but we had much fewer bookings , " he says			1
" the reason i believe there have been no cancellations is because the clients who have already paid -- safaris are usually booked several months in advance and a down payment is required -- do their own research and find out that the @entity14 countries are more than 5,000 kilometers away from @entity39 or @entity37			2
" as for the reduction in bookings , i believe it is because those who are planning their vacations are now not even considering going to @entity2 because of @entity14			1
" @entity76 says 2014 was on track to be his company 's most profitable year to date			2
then , as news of the @entity101 crisis spread , panic set in			1
" in july , we projected that august would be our best month ever and then the panic started and august was the worst month of the last two years			0
" he says october looks like it 's improving slightly but it 's difficult to tell at this point			0
" it does not make sense , " he adds			0
" you would not cancel your vacation in @entity114 because there are conflicts in the @entity117 or in @entity118			0
if something nasty was happening in @entity120 , you 'd still go to @entity121			0
" ' @entity2 is seen as a country ' @entity123 , managing director of @entity124 , says that in addition to traveler queries being down 50 to 70 % , new bookings compared with last october are also down about 50 %			1
" over the past month we have had numerous clients replying that they will be in touch after all the health scares are over , " says @entity123			0
" even if we explain how far southern @entity2 is from @entity42 , it does not change their mind			1
@entity2 is seen as a country and hardly ever as a continent			1
" @entity136 , managing director of safari travel booking company @entity137 , agrees that it 's been difficult trying to convince clients how far @entity2 is from @entity42 -- especially @entity37			1
" this morning i was dealing with clients over @entity142 who are coming on october 25 and are worried since they read in the news that there is a woman who died at @entity146 last weekend and feared that she had @entity14 , " says @entity136			0
" it was hard to convince them that she tested negative for @entity14			0
i had to refer them to @entity153 website to read more details			0
" the other big problem , say those in the industry , is a lack of knowledge of how @entity14 is contracted			0
" although the ebola virus is not airborne at this time and can only be caught through coming in contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person , and is currently limited to destinations in @entity42 , we have recently experienced a small number of clients deferring their holiday plans to the rest of the continent , " says @entity160 , product director of high end travel company @entity161			2
" we remain in constant contact with the @entity175 , @entity176 and with tourist boards and our supplier partners across the world			0
" our tour consultants are given the latest news on developments and have the ability to specifically advise clients on how the virus is transmitted so that they are able to allay clients fears			1
" meanwhile , @entity187 of the @entity188 says the top end of @entity2 's safari market has n't been hit as hard by @entity14 fears " since many of those clients are international travelers and can look at the situation sensibly			1
" " some clients have indeed decided not to book safaris this year after inquiring -- but sadly in this industry we get a lot of time wasters and i believe those people would have found another reason not to book if not @entity14 , although families are always more protective of their little ones , " says @entity187			2
@entity2 tourism was poised for growth though no figures have been released on the overall impact @entity14 has had on @entity23 tourism , in the first half of 2014 the industry had been experiencing impressive growth rates			1
according to the @entity212 's 2014 global travel report , @entity2 was due to see 4 to 6 % tourism growth this year			1
in 2013 , the continent saw international arrivals increase 5 % over 2012 , the equivalent of 3 million more tourists , to reach 56 million			2
" this year is ( now ) written off already , " says @entity136 , of @entity137			0
" by this time hotels should be issuing stop sales for the @entity221 period , but i have seen none , meaning they still have availability			0
" though this could have been due to other factors like cancellations of direct charter flights from @entity46 due to security risks , @entity14 has too played a great part			1
" @entity230 - based @entity229 tells @entity0 he 'd been considering a trip to @entity232 in late november until the @entity14 crisis erupted			0
" i wanted to go away for some winter sunshine , " he says			0
" i 've been to @entity232 previously and it 's a good time zone , easy to get to and quite nice and warm			0
" @entity229 , 26 , said media " hysteria " related to @entity14 changed his mind			0
" i just looked at the headlines and thought , it looks bad now , who knows what it will look like in a few weeks ? " @entity229 , who works in finance , says he 's not completely ruled out an @entity2 trip and is now planning a vacation in @entity67			1
' @entity248 epidemiological detective work ' since the outbreak started in march , about 9,000 @entity14 cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported , mostly in @entity252 , @entity56 and @entity253 , according to the @entity176 ( @entity176 )			0
more than half of the deaths have been in @entity56			0
and the numbers are expected to skyrocket			0
there could be up to 10,000 new @entity14 cases per week in the three hardest - hit nations by the end of the year , the @entity176 said			0
it warned that things will get worse before they get better			0
in august , @entity176 issued a warning saying @entity37 had a high risk of experiencing an @entity14 outbreak , but as yet the country has n't seen a single case			2
the @entity176 says it 's due to declare the end of the @entity14 outbreak in @entity269 and @entity270 on friday and monday , respectively			2
" in a piece of world - class epidemiological detective work , all confirmed cases in @entity270 were eventually linked back to the @entity56 air traveler who introduced the virus into the country on july 20 , " said @entity176 in a statement			2
precautionary measures in eastern and southern @entity23 countries fighting to keep @entity14 from entering their borders vary , with some countries banning travelers who have visited affected countries , while others have adopted strict border screening measures			2
@entity290 , for instance , has reportedly suspended entry for travelers who have visited @entity56 , @entity252 , @entity270 and @entity253 in the last 30 days			2
in @entity39 , all major border posts have mandatory health screening in place , including all international airports			0
@entity23 refuses to admit foreign citizens arriving from @entity14 - affected countries in @entity42 , while @entity23 citizens will be allowed to re-enter , but only after being subject to strict screening			0
the @entity301 ( @entity301 ) , a global trade association that promotes travel and tourism to @entity2 , released a statement to @entity0			1
" according to the @entity176 , the most severely affected countries are @entity252 , @entity56 and @entity253 , however , the @entity2 tourism industry has felt stark repercussions across the continent through economic losses , canceled flights and bookings , closed borders and negative perceptions , " it said			1
" these impacts reach far beyond the borders of those affected countries			0
@entity301 urges the travel industry and traveling public to remain cautious , however , to acknowledge the immense size of the continent and to continue to travel to the vast majority of the countries that remain safe			2
