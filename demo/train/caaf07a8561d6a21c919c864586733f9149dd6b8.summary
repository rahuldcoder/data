@entity0 -- they have become staples of many cable and broadcast television stations : high - speed , often dangerous police pursuits of fleeing motorists , videotaped and packaged into such shows as " @entity10			0
" in an appeal that came to the @entity13 , the issue was : when do such incidents cross over into the realm of " violent felonies " that could lead to increased jail time ? the justices , by a 6 - 3 vote thursday , dismissed an appeal from an @entity22 man who received an enhanced federal sentence because of prior serious offenses , one of which was for trying to escape in a vehicle			1
justice @entity27 said that while the federal law in question does not specifically mention dangerous car chases , they clearly are the kind of crime that deserves to be treated more seriously			1
" risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight , " @entity27 said			1
" it is well known that when offenders use motor vehicles as their means of escape they create serious potential risks of physical injury to others			0
flight from a law enforcement officer invites , even demands , pursuit			1
" @entity50 had pleaded guilty to felony possession of a firearm , a federal offense			2
he had attempted to rob two people at gunpoint , according to court records			2
he also had at least three prior felonies on his record , including an armed robbery			0
it was the third felony that concerned the high court			2
@entity22 's " resisting law enforcement " law provides various criteria , depending on the circumstances , for those who flee officers			2
@entity50 had at one time used a vehicle to escape after an officer had ordered him to stop , which is a felony under state law			1
officers had noticed @entity74 driving without headlights , and when police flashed their emergency sirens , the suspect took off and a chase ensued			2
prosecutors said @entity50 drove on the wrong side of the road and through yards with residents nearby , then rammed a fence and finally crashed into a house			0
he fled on foot and was eventually captured , thanks to a police dog in pursuit			0
under the @entity92 , @entity91 , @entity50 received a mandatory minimum 15 - year prison term for the gun possession charge , enhanced because of his past criminal record			0
the law was designed to get tough with habitual felons through longer sentences			0
@entity50 appealed , admitting he fled police and that it was a felony , but he argued it was not violent " the federal law labels as violent felonies such offenses such as burglary , arson or extortion , or where there is " conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another			1
" @entity27 said the " serious potential risk " standard applies to @entity50 ' driving behavior , since he repeatedly refused to pull over and submit to custody			1
" as that pursuit continues , the risk of an accident accumulates , " @entity27 wrote			1
" and having chosen to flee , and thereby commit a crime , the perpetrator has all the more reason to avoid capture			0
" this is the fourth time in the past four years the high court has tried to clarify the meaning of " violent felony " under the so - called residual clauses of the federal law			1
in a typically sharp dissent , justice @entity130 said the law , like the majority 's efforts to interpret its boundaries , is ultimately a failure			1
" today 's opinion will sow further confusion , " he wrote			0
" insanity , it has been said , is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results			0
four times is enough " in trying to clarify what are violent felonies under the career - criminal law			2
he said the statute should be declared " void for vagueness			1
" justice @entity150 also dissented , but for far different reasons			1
she said that under the state 's own guidelines , @entity50 ' conduct was clear : there was no aggravated vehicular flight			0
" because petitioner @entity50 was convicted only of simple vehicular flight , and not of any flight offense involving aggressive or dangerous activity , i would find he did not commit a ' violent felony ' " under the federal law			1
supported by justice @entity164 , @entity150 said states properly distinguish among various types of efforts to escape police , and that the high court should have relied on those state standards to make its ruling , rather than trying to parse the federal law 's definition of " violent " felony , which does not specifically include vehicular flight			1
@entity27 in his ruling cited a study by the @entity177 showing that at least 7,737 police chases were reported nationwide from 2001 through 2007			2
those pursuits resulted in 313 injuries to police and bystanders , or a rate of about 4 - in - 100			0
there was no indication whether the pursuit of @entity50 was videotaped by a police dashboard camera , and if so , whether that visual record was used against him in the trial or subsequent appeals			0
the case was @entity50 v. @entity192 ( 09 - 11311 ) .			0

" risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight , " justice @entity27 says
the court rejects the argument that a car chase should *n't* lead to a *stricter* sentence
justice @entity130 dissents , saying the law should be declared " void for vagueness '
justices @entity150 and @entity164 , in a separate dissent , argue there was no violent felony
