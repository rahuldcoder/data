@entity4 followed up his first - innings 56 as he ended the match unbeaten on 103 from 149 balls , scoring his 16th @entity20 ton despite needing the help of a runner			1

" it was very important for him to score runs as the team needed it most to level the series			0
i think it is a very special innings			2
hopefully , he plays plenty more innings like this for us			2
" @entity4 , a veteran of 113 tests , said he had struggled to keep momentum due to his back pain			1
" i started my innings well , but during the partnership i had a lot of discomfort and the spasms did n't allow me to move freely			2
once i was into my 30s it became very painful , " he said			0
you do n't want to create confusion and also not break the rhythm			0
if you see , @entity12 got out once i took the runner			1
but i was in such pain that i thought that the best decision in team 's interest was to have a runner instead of just giving away the wicket due to pain			0
" @entity3 captain @entity61 said the turning point was when his side were bowled out for 267 in their second innings the previous day			1
" if we had just tried to bat till lunch , the ball would have got softer and we could have scored a lot more runs			0
but unfortunately , we played some poor strokes , " he said			0

" resuming on 53 - 3 in their second innings on saturday , @entity1 soon lost nightwatchman @entity75 for four as off - spinner @entity76 claimed his fourth wicket			1
but @entity4 joined @entity12 , who made a patient 54 off 122 balls -- his 56th half - century in his record 169th @entity20 appearance -- before also falling to @entity76 at 171 - 5			1
@entity12 had been dropped by a close fielder when on 18 also off @entity76 , who claimed his first five - wicket haul in just his second outing after coming in to replace retired world record - holder @entity85			1
@entity14 , who scored 120 on debut in the previous drawn test , hit the winning runs with a six off @entity89 just before the scheduled tea break			0
meanwhile , @entity91 reached 19 - 1 at stumps of the second day of the second test against @entity94 , having bowled out the hosts for 251 in @entity96			1
@entity91 , all out for a paltry 72 in their first innings , are still 160 runs away from making @entity94 bat again at @entity101			1
the hosts resumed on 112 - 2 on saturday , but spinner @entity103 took his first five - wicket haul to restrict the deficit			1
however , @entity91 's bowling options were hit when seamer @entity107 was ruled out of the rest of the match with a torn hamstring			2
@entity111 returned to form with 80 , but had a lucky escape on 41 when he was given not out in bizarre circumstances			0
the @entity115 - born batsman pulled away from the crease just before @entity117 was about to deliver the ball , signaling he had been distracted by movement behind the bowler			0
but then he offered a shot after all and chipped a catch to @entity91 captain @entity123 , who could not persuade umpire @entity124 to change his decision of " dead ball			2
" @entity127 later took his fifth wicket of the match as @entity123 went without scoring .			0
