@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 pledged his full commitment to the space program thursday , outlining a new strategy that ends current programs while funding new initiatives intended to propel humankind farther into the solar system			1
in a speech at the @entity11 , @entity3 outlined his proposal to pump an additional $ 6 billion into @entity14 's budget over the next five years while halting a project to resume lunar missions			1
the new spending would be for research on a propulsion breakthrough to travel deeper into space , as well as development of technologies to allow humans to transport necessary supplies to work and stay longer , @entity3 said			2
" i am 100 percent committed to the mission of @entity14 and its future , " @entity3 said to applause from the audience of space program workers			1
he outlined a program including a multibillion - dollar modernization of @entity11 , expansion of private - sector and commercial space industries , creation of thousands of jobs and eventually human travel to @entity38			1
" we will actually reach space faster and more often under this plan , " @entity3 said , adding it would send more astronauts into space over the next decade than previously planned			2
" by the mid- 2030s i believe we can send people to orbit @entity38 and bring them safely back to @entity46 , " @entity3 said			1
landing on @entity38 will follow , and " i expect to be around to see it , " he said			0
instead of being scrapped as originally proposed , the @entity50 crew capsule would be used as an emergency vehicle to reach crews at the @entity53 , @entity3 said			0
@entity3 noted that the @entity54 , which had sought to send astronauts back to the moon by 2020 , is behind schedule , over budget and overall less important than other space investments			1
the administration would instead invest in deep space exploration and scientific development , he said			0
" we 've been there before , " @entity3 said of the moon			0
" there 's a lot more of space to explore and a lot more to learn when we do			2
" the proposal , which has not yet been approved by @entity71 , troubles some lawmakers from states where space centers are located			0
a shift in priorities means jobs are at stake			0
the main space centers in the @entity80 are @entity11 in @entity0 , @entity1 ; @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 ; and @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86			0
in an attempt to address such concerns , @entity3 announced a $ 40 million initiative to promote regional development and job creation			2
@entity92 , news chief at the @entity11 , told @entity2 that layoffs there will likely reach the 7,000 range with the end of @entity14 's space shuttle fleet and the cancellation of the @entity54			1
@entity3 noted that the space shuttle fleet is scheduled to be retired at the end of this year under a decision made six years ago			0
that will leave the @entity105 @entity104 capsules as the only avenue into space until commercial ventures are ready to do the job , expected to be years away			0
the new strategy reflects a new era of international cooperation on space travel , @entity3 said , also noting that @entity14 always has collaborated with private companies on building space vehicles and other work			1
@entity117 , a former astronaut and the current vice president of @entity119 , a private manned space flight company , said it 's time to " give the commercial guys a chance			1
" " @entity14 's job really should be to focus on pushing outside of low - earth orbit , of either going to explore near - earth asteroids , going back to the moon to test architecture and modules and hardware , operations for an eventual visit to @entity38			1
so , @entity14 really should be thinking farther , " @entity117 said , adding that private companies could serve as a " taxi service " for @entity14			0
some well - known astronauts from the @entity136 , which sent @entity80 astronauts to the moon 's surface from 1969 to 1972 , criticized @entity3 's plan wednesday , saying in a letter that " the @entity80 is far too likely to be on a long downhill slide to mediocrity			1
" " @entity80 must decide if it wishes to remain a leader in space , " the letter said			0
" if it does , we should institute a program which will give us the very best chance of achieving that goal			0
" the letter was signed by the first and last men to walk on the moon -- @entity155 from @entity156 and @entity157 from @entity158 -- and @entity159 , who commanded the heroic apollo 13 flight			0
they praised @entity3 's increase in total funding for space exploration , which includes money for research , the international space station and a heavy - lift rocket			2
however , the astronauts said the decision to cancel the @entity54 for manned space flight " is devastating			2
" @entity155 's crewmate , @entity172 , supported @entity3 , saying @entity14 needs to explore new frontiers , not retrace 40 - year - old footsteps			1
@entity172 rode on @entity175 with @entity3 to @entity0 , but the president said @entity172 did n't seem too impressed by a plane unable to reach low - earth orbit			1
@entity2 's @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
