@entity0 for the head of the @entity5 's counterterrorist division , @entity6 , the unknown worries him the most			1
@entity6 is leading the daunting effort to stay on top of the evolving threat landscape , which includes targeting and recruiting teenage @entity10			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity1 inside the agency 's @entity12 , he acknowledged it 's extremely difficult to track every @entity10 who might travel abroad to join terrorist groups like the @entity16			1
" i 'm worried about individuals that we do n't know about that have training , " @entity6 said			1
" we know what we know			0
but there is a number that 's greater than that that we do n't know			0
" @entity6 says @entity10 law enforcement and intelligence agencies do n't track individuals leaving the @entity10 to vacation in @entity29			1
" once you get to @entity29 , you can easily get down to @entity31 and into @entity32 " @entity6 says			2
there 's growing concern about homegrown violent extremism in the aftermath of last month 's terror attacks in @entity38			0
those strikes underscored the threat posed to the @entity41 by small groups of terrorists with western passports who are influenced by the rhetoric espoused by @entity47			1
@entity6 is concerned that type of attack could happen on @entity10 soil			1
@entity47 images appear to show @entity53 pilot burned alive when asked if there are @entity47 cells in the @entity10 , @entity6 said " there are individuals that have been in communication with groups like @entity47 who have a desire to conduct an attack " and those people are living in the @entity10 right now , but he says the term " sleeper cells " is too simplistic , because the threat is much more complicated and diffuse			1
in the @entity10 , the @entity5 has seen children as young as 15 recruited by @entity47 and @entity6 said he " ca n't speak with 100 % certainty that individuals of that age group have not gotten over there successfully			1
" in some cases , @entity6 said parents even encourage their children to be involved with terror groups			1
" there are individuals out there who are inspired by the message of terrorist groups and they encourage family members , including their children , to follow that path , " he said , adding in those cases , the @entity5 holds the parents responsible			1
opinion : why is @entity47 so successful at luring @entity86 ? @entity6 said the @entity5 is working around the clock to combat the recruitment of @entity10 but @entity10 law enforcement ca n't do the job alone			1
it 's up to families to speak up as well , he said			0
" in the majority of cases , we know that someone recognizes that change in behavior , that radicalization , " he said			0
" that family member or friend chooses not to intervene			0
and by not getting involved , the story ends in a very familiar fashion , and that 's death			0
" he also said @entity47 is aggressively pursuing women on social media			1
" the recruitment of women by @entity47 is much more than we 've ever seen by a terrorist organization , " he said			1
" we have seen everything from a female fighter -- dedicated groups of women fighters -- and those who have come over to support foreign fighters by marrying them			2
" @entity119 teen gets 4 years for wanting to join @entity47 he emphasizes @entity47 is pushing out a false narrative of what it 's like in @entity32 in order to lure them			2
monitoring social media poses its own challenges , he said			0
the sheer volume of posts calls for strong analytical skills to weed through the data , which he said is a " full time job and a challenge			0
" " we 've seen lots of places , online media , forums , social media , where there have been calls to conducting lone wolf attacks in your home country through a variety of means , not necessarily a sophisticated technique , but use what you have , use the tools you have and conduct an attack , " @entity6 said			1
" they are using it successfully , i might add , to spot , assess , identify , target folks outside of war zones , " he elaborated			0
and , of course , the @entity5 must also strike a delicate balance of respecting privacy concerns of @entity10 while trying to protect them			1
" we do n't have a desire or a right to step on somebody 's freedom of expression			0
they have a right to express their opinion , " @entity6 says			2
" but when that opinion turns into violent rhetoric and then into action , that 's something different			0
" @entity172 : @entity47 only ' interested in death and destruction ' still , the recent arrest of an @entity177 man , @entity176 , has drawn criticism that the government is making terrorists out of people			2
he raised red flags by posting messages supportive of violent jihad on social media and was eventually arrested for plotting to attack the @entity10 @entity187			2
but there were doubts about how seriously @entity176 sought to act on his threats			0
to his critics , @entity6 says , " i need folks to understand that whether you 're talking about a foreign terrorist organization directing individuals or just inspiring individuals ... we identify individuals with the intent			1
we do n't manufacture that intent			0
we do n't put that intent into their mind			0
" but do they have the capability and manpower to combat so many individuals with the intent of attacking @entity10 ? " i do n't know if enough manpower is the right word , " he said			2
" look , there are lots of threats out there , criminal threats , counter-intelligence - based threats , cyber threats and terrorism threats			0
and we have to identify those highest priority threats and focus the resources			0
there is a finite number of resources and we have to focus those resources on those threats			0
" opinion : when @entity10 leave for jihad			2

@entity5 counterterror chief to @entity1 : terrorist threat is ' complicated '
@entity6 says @entity47 has recruited @entity10 children as young as 15
@entity6 : @entity47 recruiting women ' more than we 've ever seen by a terrorist organization '
