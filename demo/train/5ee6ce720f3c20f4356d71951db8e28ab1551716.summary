-- when climate scientist @entity3 speaks , her central theme is the " roasted world " -- a bleak picture of what the planet will probably look like if carbon pollution continues unchecked , leading to 4 degrees @entity10 of warming by mid-century			1
four degrees may not sound like a lot -- but it would change our lives drastically			0
mega-heat waves in 2010 in @entity19 and @entity20 were estimated to have caused up to 50,000 heat - related deaths , according to some reports			0
this " will become the normal , " said @entity3 , a review editor of the @entity23 ' @entity25 report , speaking at the @entity23 in january			0
food production in key regions such as @entity29 and @entity30 could drop by as much as 50 % , she added			0
accelerated melting of the @entity33 and @entity34 ice sheets will cause sea levels to rise by 1 to 2 feet , putting @entity36 and @entity37 , @entity38 , as well as many other low - lying cities , at enormous risk			0
it 's a bone - chilling scenario			0
we do n't always have control of our destiny , but in the case of climate change we know exactly what it will take to protect our planet and economy from disaster			1
companies , investors and policymakers must scale up clean energy investments and scale down fossil fuel investments			1
recently , we saw compelling evidence that big business is getting more serious about climate change			2
and it came from none other than the world 's largest fossil fuel company , @entity64			2
nearly 25 years to the day after the @entity66 supertanker ran aground in @entity67 , spewing 260,000 barrels of crude oil , @entity64 has agreed to report to investors on how climate change will affect its core business model , including the prospect that major portions of its oil reserves may need to be left in the ground as carbon - reducing policies and expanded use of renewable energy take hold globally			1
@entity81 oil production since @entity66 i remain guarded about how major oil companies will ultimately transition to being energy companies rather than fossil fuel companies , boosting our economy sustainably rather than pushing it closer to a breaking point			1
but @entity64 's commitment reflects a growing consensus among business leaders and investors that climate change is a core economic risk that must be tackled now			1
this is in stark contrast to just a few years ago , when climate change was seen as a tree - hugger issue relevant more to polar bears than financial bottom lines			1
after years of foot - dragging , businesses are recognizing the scientific certainty and economic effects of climate change -- from higher food costs to broken supply chains to costlier weather - related disasters			1
they see the powerful dollars - and - cents argument for mitigating carbon pollution today rather than waiting until it is too late and too expensive			1
companies such as @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are now calling for strong climate and clean - energy policies in @entity120			2
they are among more than 750 companies that have signed @entity123 , which brings together companies and individuals to demonstrate support for national action on climate change			1
the world 's largest institutional investors -- including many of the 500 that attended the @entity132 on @entity133 -- are actively integrating climate risks and opportunities into their investment decisions			0
some are already pulling out of riskier carbon - intensive investments such as coal companies and are setting specific targets for elevating clean energy investments			1
major stock exchanges are also beginning to require listed companies to disclose climate and other sustainability risks to investors			0
and securities regulators , including the @entity148 and state insurance regulators , have taken strong steps , at @entity151 and investors ' urging , to require similar climate risk disclosure			0
these actions are profoundly important if we are to have any hope of thwarting , or limiting , the impact of this colossal global threat , which requires a massive shift in our economy to clean energy and away from fossil fuels			2
solving climate change and building a sustainable global economy can not happen unless companies and investors realize their role in the problem and become part of the solution			1
yet even as the biggest companies in the world change their business practices and come out in support of strong climate action , it remains a deeply controversial issue in @entity180 , which has led to policy paralysis			2
we must demand a vigorous debate over how best to meet the climate challenge , casting climate deniers out to the fringe where they now belong			0
unless we act now , the threat that climate change poses to the planet will be exponentially greater			2
and the solutions will be increasingly harder to implement down the road			0
the " roasted world " warning is a real threat , but it does n't need to become our reality			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

25 years ago , the @entity66 supertanker created a *gigantic* oil spill in @entity67 *waters*
@entity199 : top companies such as @entity64 are ready to act on climate change
she says businesses realize how carbon pollution drags down their bottom lines
@entity199 : if they do n't embrace clean energy now , it may be too late and too expensive
