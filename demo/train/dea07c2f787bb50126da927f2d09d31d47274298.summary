-- in the slums of the @entity4 capital , @entity5 , visiting the bathroom usually means one of two things ; a trip to the local pit latrine or the ' flying toilet '			1
the former entails letting nature take its course in a rickety outhouse perched atop a hole in the ground -- a facility also used by hundreds of other people in the neighborhood			2
the latter meanwhile consists of relieving oneself in a plastic bag before throwing the offending item away in the street			2
a 2011 report by the @entity26 found that these arrangements led to environmental contamination and the spread of diseases such as typhoid and tuberculosis			2

alongside a group of fellow @entity38 alumni and local @entity4 partners , @entity36 has helped found @entity44 -- a start - up that aims to make a business out of cleaning up @entity5 's sanitary mess			1
it plans to collect human waste in a series of custom - built toilets before transforming it into compost and fertilizer products that can be sold to the local agriculture industry			1
" in @entity4 alone there are 10 million people who live in the slums and 8 million of them do n't have access to a clean toilet , " says @entity36			1
" by providing this service we believe there is tremendous potential to operate a for - profit social business			1
in terms of agriculture , @entity67 puts ( fertilizer ) at a half trillion dollar business in @entity72 alone , " he adds			1
the @entity74 model works by first installing a network of low cost sanitation centers , which provide access to clean toilets , at various locations in the slums			1
these premises -- that trap the waste in air tight containers -- are then franchised out to local entrepreneurs at a cost of 45,000 shillings ( roughly $ 500 ) a year , with a renewal fee charged to continue after this period			2
franchisees are funded primarily by micro-finance loans , explains @entity36			2
they charge residents a small fee , usually 5 @entity93 ( $ 0.06 ) to use their facilities in order to make their money back			0

" currently we have 25 facilities up and running ... we 're collecting about three metric tons of waste per week which can all be converted into fertilizer , " says @entity36			0
" by the end of this year we want to have 250 franchises			0
we think by the end of the following year we can safely be at 1,000 toilets , " he adds			1
creating employment opportunities for local residents can also be a benefit of the project and important to its greater success			0
" success of the business model like @entity74 depends on creating viable franchise opportunities for local entrepreneurs and attractive services for slum residents , " says @entity117 of @entity118			0
" projects such as these should hire locally and this is more than a good development principle			0
it makes business sense too			0

by the end of 2013 @entity36 says @entity44 plans to collect enough waste to power a bio-generator that can sell electricity back into the @entity4 national grid			0
" the waste of 100,000 people generates about 1 gigawatt of power			0
so right now when we have 1,200 users every day we 're not at a point where we can produce sufficient amounts of electricity , " says @entity36			1
" this is something we 'll be looking to do later this year or next year , " he adds			0
" but we 're not quite there yet			0

the slums of @entity5 lack *efficient* and clean sanitation systems
a new start - up aims to improve these conditions by installing a series of custom built toilets
those behind the company believe it could be a *multi-million* dollar *enterprize* one day
