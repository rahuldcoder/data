" in a laboratory , the marijuana is distilled down to mostly cannabidiols , which advocates say is the potent medicinal value of the drug			0
@entity88 , a medical marijuana clinic in @entity90 , @entity91 , helped create the original tincture @entity8 took			2

" i do think there 's potential for these cannabinoids to be medically relevant , but at this time we do n't know the risks , " says @entity147			2
because marijuana is illegal at the federal level , the government has n't conducted any thorough research on the possible medicinal benefits			0
@entity147 is in favor of federal testing , but without it , he says marijuana is too risky to administer to children			0
" we do n't know if these treatments are going to work for every given child , or every given adolescent			0
there may well be serious side effects			0
" @entity0 says he 'd pit his son 's progress on medical marijuana against any pharmaceutical drug that currently treats @entity17 's syndrome			1
