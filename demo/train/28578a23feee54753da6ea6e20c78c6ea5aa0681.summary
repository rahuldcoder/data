-- for a " @entity3 , " @entity2 's @entity1 has quite a reputation			1
the character , a sensitive 15 - year - old high school freshman who initially keeps to himself , was first introduced to a generation of readers in 1999 as the protagonist of @entity2 's novel , " @entity10			1
" since then , he 's become just as famous for being too @entity12 © for some classrooms as he is for endearing himself to a legion of fans			0
in a series of letters addressed to an anonymous reader , @entity1 describes the disorientation of losing a friend to suicide , the ways high school can feel like an experiment in isolation , and , at the heart of the story , his bond with older students @entity31 and her stepbrother , @entity33			0
now , 13 years after readers first met him , @entity1 is in theaters this weekend in an adaptation written and directed by @entity2			1
the movie features actors who 've appeared in versions of other young - adult books , such as @entity41 ( the " @entity43 " series ) , @entity44 ( " @entity46 " ) and @entity45 ( the @entity48 's " @entity47 " )			0
but there are n't any spells or mythological beings in @entity2 's tale -- there 's just @entity1 , the shy , introspective loner who finds acceptance within @entity31 and @entity33 's circle of friends			1
the great thing about @entity2 's story , actress @entity45 said at a recent screening , is that while it focuses on the turmoil of one high school freshman , it 's nonetheless relatable			1
" it makes you realize that everyone 's kind of the same , " she said , noting that all have a coming - of - age story that 's seen love and pain , laughter and heartache			2
" even though you feel like you 're the only one going through it at the time , everyone has at one point or another , " she said			0
in the end , @entity45 concluded , " @entity82 " shows that we 're all misfits in our own way			1
@entity1 's early ' 90s - era high school experience touches on drugs , alcohol , sex and abuse , and at the time of its publication , the book was one of many examinations of the darker side of the teen experience , said @entity95 , children 's and teen editor for @entity97			1
what set it apart from the rest was its voice			0
in the late ' 90s , " there was this wave , of what it felt like to a lot of people who worked with kids and books , of really depressing books , " @entity95 recalled			0
" there was a continuum called the ' teen problem novel , ' the novel about teenage pregnancy , and the novel about cutting , and the novel about anorexia			0
" right around the end of the ' 90s , a lot of those books , they were by and large really well - written , but they were really bleak			0
and ' @entity10 , ' while it 's not really a laugh riot , was still funny enough and different enough from those incredibly bleak ones to catch a lot of people 's attention			1
" it also did n't hurt that it was published by @entity132 -- back then home to " @entity134 , " @entity135 and " @entity136 " -- through @entity139 ' @entity138 imprint , which gave it an air of youthful understanding			2
" ( ' @entity82 ' ) resonated because at the time , it was dealing with issues that were n't really in the mainstream , " said @entity142 , executive vice president and publisher of @entity139			1
by today 's standards , " @entity82 " might seem low - tech , but the novel has n't lost its relevance , appearing at no. 16 on @entity150 's 100 best - ever teen fiction poll this summer and hitting no. 1 more recently on a @entity152 ' best - seller list			1
" the teens that i speak to really love that these issues are being dealt with but it 's not overdramatized , " @entity153 said			1
" it 's interesting that a book published so long ago is even more relevant now			2
" add in the strong reaction from schools and libraries -- " @entity82 " is no stranger to the @entity164 's list of frequently challenged books -- and the book was " viral " before anyone even knew what that was , @entity95 said			1
" it had that hand - to - hand , pass - along effect that books ( that ) kids would get from their teachers or librarians do n't have , " @entity95 said			2
" my daughter is in high school , and she wanted to read it before the movie came out , and i do think it spent a little bit of time getting passed around the cabins at her summer camp			0
" that peer endorsement from a friend was also how @entity187 , now 31 , first picked it up in 1999 and became a fan			2
" i had just started college , " recalled @entity187 , music editor for culture site @entity191			2
" and i remember feeling like , ' these people understand me			0
' " she was one of those kids " who listened to college radio , " she joked , and while she might have wished to identify with love interest @entity31 or witty @entity33 , it was the sensitive but openhearted @entity1 with whom she connected			0
" i think that 's a universal feeling			0
you could be the class president , but you still feel like people do n't entirely get you , " @entity187 said			0
" i do n't think that ever really changes , but it does go away a little bit			0
" rereading it as an adult , she said she can see why it 's a book meant for a younger audience -- its earnestness and angst being out of step with grown - up sensibilities			0
but " the fact that it 's stood the test of time for 13 years is important , because the @entity218 marketplace turns so fast ; it turns on a dime with trends , " @entity187 said			0
" i think that this ( book ) still existing is a credit to @entity2			1
" and that persistent fondness for " @entity82 " is " one of the things that makes a classic , " @entity95 said			1
" as the first generation of ' @entity82 ' readers starts having kids and seeing them grow up on their own , it 'll be interesting to see how freely they share it			2
... i think ' @entity82 ' has a good chance of experiencing that kind of generational longevity			1

" @entity10 " stood out when it was published in 1999
the @entity2 novel is one that teens love to pass on to friends
its content of drugs , alcohol and sex has been *controversial*
editor : " @entity82 " has the chance for " generational longevity "
