, its demise as the leading economic power is five years away and the next president of the @entity7 will preside over an economy that plays second fiddle to @entity10 's			1
the lender posted data on its @entity13 that puts 2016 as @entity14 for @entity10 as the world 's dominant economic power -- the year when @entity10 's growth trajectory intersects the decline of the @entity7 's share of world gross domestic product in terms of purchasing price parity			1
according to the figures , the @entity10 economy would grow from $ 11.2 trillion in 2011 to $ 19 trillion in 2016			1
over the same period , the @entity7 economy will rise from a dominant $ 15.2 trillion to a trailing $ 18.8 trillion			2
but , as the saying goes , statistics are often used like a drunken man uses a lamp - post -- for support rather than illumination			0
an analyst at the @entity5 said in a statement much hinges on whether economic size is measured by purchasing power parity -- what your money can actually buy on the ground in any given economy , the basis of the famous " @entity50 " index -- or gdp at market rates -- which is measured by converting the national currency into a common currency ( normally the @entity7 dollar ) and measuring how much is flowing through the economy			1
the @entity5 projects @entity52 in dollars will be $ 15.2 trillion this year while @entity10 's will be $ 6.5 trillion , rising to $ 18.8 trillion and $ 11.2 trillion respectively by 2016			1
under this measure , the @entity7 looks likely to stay the world 's no. 1 economy if current growth rates are maintained			1
" the @entity5 considers that gdp in purchase - power - parity ( @entity58 ) terms is not the most appropriate measure for comparing the relative size of countries to the global economy , because @entity58 price levels are influenced by non-traded services , which are more relevant domestically than globally , " the @entity5 said			1
" the fund believes that gdp at market rates is a more relevant comparison			0
under this metric , the @entity7 is currently 130 % bigger than @entity10 , and will still be 70 % larger by 2016			1
" nevertheless , the @entity58 index still has its fans , with some contending that @entity10 could be even stronger than it appears on paper thanks to the current artificially suppressed level of its currency			2
" @entity10 actively suppresses the renminbi on the currency markets through massive dollar purchases			2
as a result the renminbi is deeply undervalued on the foreign - exchange markets			0
just comparing the economies on their exchange rates misses that altogether , " said @entity84 columnist @entity83			0
" purchasing power parity is not a perfect measure			0
but it measures the output of economies in terms of real goods and services , not just paper money			0
that 's why it 's widely used to compare economies			0
the @entity5 publishes @entity58 data			0
so does the @entity99 ( @entity99 )			0
many economists rely on them , " he said			0
while the slope of the graph is declining for the @entity7 and rising for @entity10 , reports of the death of the @entity7 economy look certain to be greatly exaggerated and could still be many decades away			2
other measures such as per capita income as a proportion of gdp still sees the @entity7 many years ahead of @entity10 and other readings that measure social and structural problems could still see the @entity10 juggernaut blow a tire yet .			1

the @entity5 says @entity10 will *overtake* the @entity7 as the world 's leading economic power in 2016
analysts *dispute* the figures saying that @entity10 still has a long way to go before it catches up
@entity10 must *overcome* many structural and social problems before it is the global economic power
