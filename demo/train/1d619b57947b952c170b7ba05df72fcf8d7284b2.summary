@entity0 , @entity1 -- armed gunmen faced off with @entity1 police and soldiers inside an upscale @entity0 shopping mall early sunday , hours after brazenly gunning down shoppers , diners and more			1
around 2:30 a.m. sunday ( 6:30 p.m. et saturday ) -- an hour after reporting five " visibly shaken " hostages had been released -- @entity1 's @entity10 cryptically tweeted " major operations underway			1
" what that meant was a mystery , and it did n't quell fears about what has happened or might happen to an unknown number of civilians who were still unaccounted for inside			1
the same agency offered an update about three hours later stating that hostages were being held " in several locations , " adding there was " no communications as yet			1
" by then , government authorities had secured the mall 's upper levels , though it was not known where the attackers -- and the threat -- remained			1
hours earlier , @entity1 's president announced that 39 people , including some of his close relatives , were confirmed dead in the attack			1
two gunmen , including one who was detained after being shot , are also dead			2
@entity39 , secretary to the @entity40 , tweeted another 293 people got treatment at three area hospitals , which " are appealing for more blood			2
" the wounded range in age from 2 to 78 , the disaster operations center said , urging people to " remember them in your prayers			2
" q and a : @entity53 grew amid @entity55 's lawlessness @entity53 , an @entity56 - linked militant group based in @entity55 with ties to @entity0 's @entity59 district and whose most recent attack of this scale came july 2010 in @entity64 's capital , claimed responsibility for the carnage and vowed not to negotiate with @entity1 authorities			1
it claimed that " all @entity75 " were escorted from the mall before the attack , suggesting its targets were people who did n't believe in their extreme form of @entity74			2
" the @entity78 are still strong inside # @entity79 and still holding their ground , " the group said late saturday via @entity77			1
" all praise is due to @entity82 ! " @entity1 authorities , though , insist they have the upper hand , where it 's now early sunday morning			1
the last few hours of saturday and the first few of sunday , in @entity1 , were largely quiet outside the mall except for movement police tweeted that the attackers " have been isolated and pinned down in a room by security forces			1
" and @entity92 , the national government 's cabinet secretary for interior and coordination , hinted that the worst should be over			1
" our security forces have taken control of the situation , " @entity92 said			2
" @entity102 shopping mall have been isolated and pinned down in a room by security forces in the ongoing operation , " the national police said on @entity77			1
@entity1 's president , @entity106 , blasted " the despicable perpetrators of this cowardly act ( who ) hoped to intimidate , divide and cause despondency among @entity1 and would like to ( create ) a closed , fearful and fractured society			1
" @entity2 security analyst : @entity1 , @entity113 high on @entity53 's list @entity1 is no stranger to terrorism , including a 1998 bombing at the @entity118 in @entity0 that left 213 dead and other attacks before and since tied to @entity56 and related groups			1
in a televised speech late saturday , @entity106 said his nation has " overcome " such attacks before , refusing to budge from its values or relinquish his security			2
and it will do so again , he promised			2
" we shall hunt down the perpetrators wherever they run to , " the president said			2
" we shall get them , and we shall punish them for this heinous crime			2
midday peace shattered by gunfire , blasts " @entity79 lends itself a serene and safe environment away from the city centre , " the mall 's official website states			2
that may have been true before -- while there had been warnings , the high - end mall filled with more than 80 stores and restaurants had never been targeted			1
but it could n't have been further from the truth saturday			2
rattles of gunshots that started around noon shattered any sense of normalcy among those picking up groceries , savoring lunch and browsing through the racks at stores			0
@entity158 was sipping coffee when he heard what first sounded like a fallen table , then the continuing rat - a - tat of gunfire			1
as the gunshots became louder , people began screaming and running for the exits			0
gripped by fear : not seeing attackers was part of the terror some went outside , only to turn around and go back into the four - story mall after realizing bullets were flying there as well			1
@entity158 was among them , joining about 20 people who took shelter for about five hours in a women 's bathroom cubicle			0
" they had grenades , and it was really , really loud , " he told @entity2 , adding that he noticed tear gas in the corridors as well			0
" all of us felt like they were close			0
" as people texted family and friends outside the mall , word spread that nobody could be trusted -- and , even if the good guys could be sorted from the bad guys , the barrage of intermittent gunfire made any escape seem futile			0
@entity196 , a @entity197 resident , experienced similar horror in the mall 's parking garage			0
as her car pulled up , she and others heard gunfire -- prompting them to crawl underneath and sneak behind cars before getting into a stairwell			0
she had company there , including two people bleeding from gunshot wounds			0
eventually , the stairwell lights went back on and the door to a nearby supermarket opened , so they dashed through and past a nearby loading dock to safety			0
" there was blood throughout the supermarket , " @entity196 recalled			0
" ... it was n't clear if it was ok to exit			0
i was short of sheep following			0
" soldiers crawl under cars , copters fly overhead by then , the sight of @entity1 soldiers in military fatigues crawling under cars with their guns cocked made clear that the once shiny , pristine @entity79 had become a war zone			1
the whirr of surveillance helicopters overhead drove home the point			0
police took those leaving the building in a straight line , arms raised in the air			0
they were all taken to a secluded place for vetting to ensure they were not attackers			1
the military asked media not to televise anything live because the gunmen might be watching screens inside the mall and therefore take cues on their movement			0
and everyone else , except for authorities , was urged to stay away as roads and nearby locales , including another shopping center , was closed down			0
world leaders condemn terror attack at @entity1 mall , pledge support the @entity260 condemned the attack " in the strongest possible terms , " voicing solidarity with @entity1 while calling terrorism " one of the most serious threats to international peace and security			1
" most of the casualties are @entity1 , authorities said			1
but the mall is popular with expatriates and foreign nationals , who are among those killed and injured			0
that includes two dead @entity280 nationals , their government said			1
likewise , two @entity281 -- one of them a diplomat -- died in the attack , according to prime minister @entity286 's office			0
@entity288 secretary of state @entity287 said there were several @entity288 among the injured but none among the dead , though the wife of a foreign national working for the @entity292 was killed			0
" as we prepare to bring the world 's leaders at the @entity299 next week , " @entity287 said in reference to the upcoming @entity295 , " we are reminded again in tragedy of our common humanity			0
" @entity2 's @entity302 and @entity303 reported and wrote from @entity304 ; @entity305 reported from @entity0			0
@entity2 's @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity314 contributed to this report .			0
