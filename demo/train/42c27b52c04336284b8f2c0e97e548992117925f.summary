-- an anti-abortion activist charged with gunning down a @entity3 , @entity4 , doctor can not use the " necessity defense " at trial , a judge ruled tuesday			1
@entity8 , 51 , is set to stand trial january 11 on one count of first - degree murder in the death of dr. @entity13 , who was shot to death at his church may 31			1
@entity13 ran a women 's clinic in which he performed abortions			1
@entity13 , 67 , was one of the few @entity19 doctors who performed late - term abortions			1
he had already survived one attempt on his life before he was slain			0
under a necessity defense , a defendant argues an action was justified because breaking the law was more advantageous to society than following it			1
several anti-abortion activists facing criminal charges have attempted to use the defense but none has been successful			0
in an @entity34 interview last month , @entity8 admitted killing @entity13 and said he plans to argue at this trial that the shooting was justified			1
" because of the fact preborn children 's lives were in imminent danger , this was the action i chose , " he said			0
" ... i want to make sure that the focus is , of course , obviously on the preborn children and the necessity to defend them			0
" @entity8 's comments prompted prosecutors to file a motion asking @entity50 judge @entity49 to bar @entity8 's attorneys from using the defense			1
@entity49 noted that the @entity56 , in a previous case regarding blocking entrance to an abortion clinic , ruled the necessity defense can not be used when the harm the defendant claims to be avoiding through his or her actions is a constitutional and legal activity , and the defendant broke the law			1
that precedent , @entity49 said , required him to rule that the necessity defense is not a viable defense in @entity4 or in the @entity8 case			1
defense attorney @entity68 pointed out to @entity49 that the defense team has not yet acknowledged what their tactic might be			0
@entity8 , however , filed a 100 - page motion on his own behalf , @entity50 district attorney @entity72 said tuesday , on the necessity defense , acknowledging it previously has been unsuccessful			1
prosecutors also asked @entity49 to bar @entity8 's attorneys from claiming his alleged actions were justified because he used force in the defense of another -- the unborn			2
@entity49 said that would require further argument -- particularly an offering from defense attorneys regarding the evidence they plan to present in support of that premise at trial			0
" i will leave the door open on the issues surrounding use of force in defense of another , " the judge said , adding he does not mean it 's " wide open			2
" under the law , such a defense can only be used if a defendant was preventing unlawful conduct			2
@entity72 argued that @entity13 posed no threat that would justify his shooting			2
" dr. @entity13 was not an aggressor , " she said			1
@entity8 is also charged with two counts of aggravated assault for threatening two church members			2
dressed in a coat and tie , he conferred with his attorneys and listened intently to the arguments on tuesday			0
in a june interview with @entity0 's @entity112 , @entity8 would not admit that he killed @entity13 , but said that if he is convicted , " the entire motive was the defense of the unborn			1
" @entity8 's attorneys also argued tuesday that the trial should be moved outside @entity3 because extensive pretrial publicity in the case could have tainted the jury pool			2
@entity72 , meanwhile , noted that @entity8 , who has talked often to the media , brought some of that publicity on himself			0
@entity49 said 300 jury summonses have gone out in the case , and he was optimistic that some impartial jurors could be found			0
however , he said he would revisit the issue later if the court experienced difficulty in picking jurors			0
@entity68 also asked that the judge prohibit prosecutors from excluding potential jurors because they have anti-abortion beliefs			0
the judge said he was confident that some individuals who are anti-abortion would still be able to make an impartial decision , but suggested the issue be examined on a juror - by - juror basis if the court recognizes a pattern of exclusion during jury selection			0
" i ca n't make a pretrial ruling and just make a broad - brush approach , " he said .			0
