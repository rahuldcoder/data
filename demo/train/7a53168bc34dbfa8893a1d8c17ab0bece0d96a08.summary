@entity0 , @entity1 -- the clerks at @entity5 's store on @entity0 's @entity6 are well - trained			1
when asked recently by a reporter about a new @entity9 rumored to be opening down the street , one worker said he did n't know about it , and even if he did , he could n't say			1
he did point out that someone is building a store with a glass roof that looks a lot like some other @entity5 stores			1
another employee smiled , looked away and said he did n't know anything			2
but according to a person familiar with the plans who is bound by a nondisclosure agreement , @entity5 has already begun work on such a store in @entity0			1
like the @entity26 - designed @entity9 on @entity28 's @entity27 , it will have a tall , striking glass storefront , the person said			0
and like an upcoming store in a suburban @entity33 mall , the new store will open next year a short walk away from a smaller one , which will close			1
for this development in the beach town near @entity39 , @entity5 has gone to extremes to ensure secrecy			1
the behavior has perplexed and infuriated city officials who are unclear why @entity5 would feel the need to hide a new store when it already has one a couple of blocks away			1
the @entity0 store episode also illustrates @entity5 's unusually covert way of doing business			1
interviews with almost two dozen people familiar with @entity9 negotiations say the @entity54 , @entity1 , company sometimes employs uncommon legal tactics , refuses to name itself in public documents and hearings , and has sworn city government officials to secrecy			1
an @entity5 spokeswoman declined to comment			1
' nobody would talk ' @entity62 , the real estate developer who has represented @entity5 at @entity0 city meetings , has carefully avoided mentioning @entity5 by name			1
when reached by phone late one day in september , he declined to comment on the project , citing a confidentiality agreement with the company			2
@entity5 , which recently began construction on the site , has managed to skate through most of the city 's stringent public reviews			1
in the first , @entity0 's @entity73 employed an unusual measure at an august 17 meeting			1
the only development proposal on the agenda that night involved tearing down the former site of a three - story @entity81 bookstore in the city 's prized outdoor shopping district and constructing a 75 - foot edifice that would require a special permit			2
instead of discussing and then voting on the project , as is usually the case , officials placed it on the consent calendar , which allows the commission members to vote on it immediately without input from residents in the audience			0
from proposal to unanimous approval , the entire process took 30 seconds , an archived video from the meeting shows			1
" nobody would talk about the fact that it was @entity5 , " said @entity102 , who has covered the public meetings for her @entity105 blog			1
" they really did n't want to have to say anything about it			2
" even @entity111 , the city planner who was assigned to and recommended the approval of the project , declined to name the incoming tenant			1
" i 've been asked not to divulge that information , " @entity111 said in an interview			0
" i really ca n't say			2
i want to respect the applicant 's wishes			0
" several aspects of his dealings with the company for the new store were out of the ordinary , he said			2
still , he favored having the new store			2
" it was a project that has met code , and it was , we thought , a well - done project that did n't have any significant issues , " @entity111 said			2
" it fit in with the neighborhood , and it was compatible in our opinion			0
" @entity133 , chairman of @entity0 's @entity134 , does not agree with @entity111 's assessment			1
" it 's a one - liner , " @entity133 said in an interview			0
" there 's nothing about it to me as an architect that holds my interest at all , and from an environmental point of view , i think it 's irresponsible			0
" the september 19 meeting @entity5 's team presented the new store to the board of architects on september 19			1
according to an audio recording of the meeting , @entity62 , the developer , said he was " representing a retail user who prefers to remain unbranded at this time			0
" @entity133 said he was offended that the documents related to the project were submitted after the meeting had started , and were incomplete			0
the other board members agreed , and @entity133 suggested they vote to delay the process , giving @entity5 more time to submit a complete report			1
@entity133 and another member , @entity160 , raised concerns about the building 's sustainability			0
glass structures might work in @entity28 , in the shadows of tall buildings , but how would they fare under direct @entity1 sun ? " when i 'm in these stores , " @entity160 began , paused and then whispered , " you know , i mean , the @entity5 stores , they sometimes can get hot because there are so many people			1
" later that night , @entity160 said : " that 's a little kind of irritating that we ca n't say its name , but so , that makes it seem veiled in some sort of mystery to me			0
" the architectural board voted unanimously to delay the project			0
but six minutes later , as the board was preparing to adjourn , the @entity5 team returned and requested that the board vote again			1
" they want us to vote on it ? " asked @entity187 , the board 's vice chairwoman			0
" um , " @entity133 stammered , " do we have a precedent for this ? " @entity5 's developer was allowed again to plead his case			1
issues of sustainability and environmental impact are outside of the @entity134 's purview , and therefore , should not be factored into the reasoning for the vote , he said			0
" i 'm sorry , but i feel you guys were off on a tangent there , " @entity62 said			0
" we asked you to look at the design aspects of this building			0
" @entity62 addressed the question of how green the building would be by saying , " this company has a proven track record in sustainability			0
they have many , many programs			0
they 've been well - known for it around the world			0
" @entity217 retorted that it was disingenuous of @entity62 to tout @entity5 's environmental record without ever saying the name of the company			2
" is it worth stepping back and being more critical of who they are and what they 're making ? " @entity217 said later in an interview with @entity2			0
" are there things we 're not seeing because it 's so beautiful ? or because we love @entity5 so much ? " yet , when it came time to vote for the second time that night , @entity217 gave her nod to the project			2
so did other board members who praised the store 's conceptual design			0
" it 's going to be the most amazing , you know , most interesting building on the @entity6 , probably by far , " @entity160 said			0
" i have seen other ones of these built , and i 'm glad that we 're going to get this new version here in @entity0 soon , hopefully soon			2
" of the five board members present at the meeting on september 19 , @entity133 was the only one to vote against the proposal			0
it was only the second time he had voted " no " in his seven - year tenure , he said			0
as the stunned board members ended the meeting after passing @entity5 's project , @entity133 could be heard mumbling , " coming back in here and manipulating us			1
" @entity5 's perceived arrogance in interviews , @entity217 described @entity5 as arrogant , its store architecture as temple - like and its demands for secrecy as odd			1
@entity133 described the secrecy aspect as silly and childish , and the company 's attitude as overly confident			0
concerns over @entity5 's perceived arrogance have been a topic of conversation among the company 's board members , including @entity267 and @entity268 , according to accounts in the new " @entity273 " biography of the late @entity5 co-founder by @entity272			2
" i 'm not worried about that , " the book quotes @entity273 as saying , " because we 're not arrogant			0
" whatever the motivation , @entity5 's behind - the - curtain strategies have been working			2
getting approval for a retail development in @entity0 , especially on the @entity6 , is notoriously difficult and slow - moving , said a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity to protect his relationship with the city			1
" somehow this thing is being approved very quickly , " said @entity287 , a commercial real estate exec who lives in @entity0 but has not done business with the city			1
" something is going on there that does n't sound right			1
" @entity5 's contentious retail project was finally challenged on october 20			1
@entity297 , an architect in @entity0 , filed an appeal with the city 's @entity73			1
" obviously someone is in a big hurry to get this approved , " @entity297 said in an interview			0
" there just was not sufficient information provided			0
" at a hearing , @entity297 and @entity133 argued the new store should have to defer to thorough public scrutiny and play by the same rules that apply to every other developer in the city			2
one resident , apparently frustrated with all of the secrecy , approached the microphone for no other reason than to address the elephant in the room			0
" we all know what 's going to be there , " said @entity318 with a dramatic pause			0
" @entity318 's prediction appears to be coming true			0
the appeal failed , and @entity5 is not expected to face any more procedural hurdles in @entity0 that could slow the store 's development			1
for @entity5 , the quietest path often leads to victory .			2

@entity5 and its *contractors* have declined to say whether the store is coming
