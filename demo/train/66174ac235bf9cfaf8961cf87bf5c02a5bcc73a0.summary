-- it is no accident that @entity3 comes in the darkest time of year			1
the winter holidays are about light , about miracles , and about waking up to light when it is least visible to the naked eye			0
food-wise , we jolt our senses alive through texture , taste and flavor with fried foods that couple warmth , crispness , and the smoothness of oil in order to reinvigorate and fine - tune us just as the sun begins to seemingly disappear altogether			1
for some , @entity3 is " the potato pancake holiday " -- a holiday that takes the mundane potato and gives it a massive makeover			1
it is shredded and tossed and recombined , squeezed and remolded into new form and then fried up lightly so that its texture shifts , its flavor alters			1
the latke ( pancake ) itself becomes the miracle of light , of oil , and of transformation			0
read more : @entity38 , the @entity40 festival of lights @entity3 has always been this " potato pancake holiday " in my house			1
no matter what i serve , my family likes simple crispy potato latkes best			1
yet in this vastly changing landscape of food , i have tried all different kinds : zucchini , beet , sweet potato , celery root , and apple - horseradish			1
the favorite is still simple potato			2
today we have tiny latkes served with goat 's cheese , tomatoes , herbs , or topped with smoked salmon and dill at latke and vodka parties			2
topped with salmon , they make great appetizers			0
potatoes have only been part of this holiday since the 18th century , when they came to @entity72 from the @entity73			0
the word latkes stuck , coming from " platke " in @entity77 and potato pancakes spread throughout @entity72			1
they came to the @entity79 with immigrants from @entity72 at the end of the 19th century			0
i have celebrated @entity3 throughout my life , lighting candles each night for eight nights to recall the miracle of the oil			1
i then have at least one dinner of slowly cooked brisket complemented by crisp fragrant potato latkes cooked in oil and , of course , homemade applesauce			1
more from @entity94 : your photos from @entity97 total solar eclipse yet of all the @entity99 of years past , the most memorable for me was spent in @entity100 with my children at the home of dear friends			0
as we walked past houses nearby , we saw the candles lit in the windows and everyone gathering with their own families			2
when we got to our friends , we lit the candles on several menorahs and had a festive meal			2
there were no latkes that night , only delicious @entity117 stuffed vegetables and sufganiyot , @entity120 doughnuts stuffed with jam , much more popular than pancakes in the holy land			1
unlike in @entity79 where there are too many presents , the highlight of this evening was being together with friends and family			0
i also remember taking my children with me to the shuk ( marketplace ) in downtown @entity133 to buy our own sufganiyot			0
we waded through crowds of people excitedly waving their money at the bakers in what felt like a giant pastry auction , all so we could sink our teeth into these massive orbs of fried dough , still warm , dripping with jam			2
share with us your defining moment of 2012 these doughnuts were no laughing matter in @entity100 , and in @entity79 , for the years that followed , we made our own renditions			2
we were revamping our traditions so that the food and the family , more than the material gifts , were the markers of our joyful memories			0
for many years after , i went to my children 's schools and helped teach the cafeteria staff about how to make jelly donuts from scratch			0
this was a process , again , of transforming the dough , that flat ball of flour , once something simple growing in the ground , and turning it into something both crispy and smooth , doughy , savory and sweet			0
the doughnut and the latke , more than the tradition of presents and gifts , were the bright light of our winter holiday			0
through the mixer and past the frying pan , the flour and the potato and everything else we added over the years transformed before our very eyes -- reminding us of an ancient tradition meant to recall the miracle of light			1
@entity189 's latest cookbook is titled quiches , @entity191 , and couscous : my search for @entity195 cooking in @entity196			0

the word @entity3 or @entity3 means *re-dedication* and is also known as the @entity200
it is celebrated for eight days and each day a candle on the @entity203 -- an eight - *stemmed* *candelabrum* -- is lit
@entity206 food *includes* latkes ( fried potato pancakes ) and sufganiyots ( doughnuts )
