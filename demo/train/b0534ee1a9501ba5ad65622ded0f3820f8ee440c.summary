-- i went online this morning to see the @entity3 ad -- the one some are calling the most racist in history -- expecting to see some really offensive stuff			1
instead , i saw some really silly stuff			2
the names of some of the black men in the lineup are hilarious			0
and i would think that 's the point of a commercial with a talking goat			1
it 's meant to be ridiculous and not taken seriously			2
it 's comedy of the absurd , along the lines of @entity22 ' " @entity21 , " @entity24 's parents on " @entity25 " or " @entity26 ? " does it play on stereotypical imagery ? yes , and because of that , i can see how some could be a bit put off by a police lineup featuring all black men before a frightened white woman			1
but come on , one of the suspects ' names is " @entity38			0
" the circumstances surrounding the scene in the commercial are so outrageously over the top , i found myself snickering more than anything			0
similar to the way i snickered during a skit featuring @entity46 , who was making fun of racism with the creation of his character @entity50 , a blind white supremacist in the @entity51			1
" you 've never left this property , have you , mr. @entity50 ? " " no , sir , not in many years			0
" " what if i were to tell you that you are an @entity56 ? " " sir ! listen ! i 'm gon na make this clear			0
i am in no way , shape or form involved in any n * * * erdom ! " @entity64			0
the @entity3 commercials ' brand of frat - boy physical humor is n't everyone 's thing			1
it could be seen as callous or making light of battered women			0
for me , though , the presence of a talking goat put me in a different " @entity76 " - ish mindset			1
there 's a reason " @entity76 " remains a high - rated show , why " @entity84 " is the longest - running sitcom in history , why a third installment of " @entity83 " is being released : a lot of people like dumb , frat - boy humor draped in fantasy			2
and i 'm not trying to say @entity89 ( whose real name is @entity89 ) scripted a commercial that is as brilliant as anything we 've seen on the " @entity94			0
" and because of the rape fantasies in his music and liberal use of homophobic slurs on @entity100 , i question why the advertising executives at @entity3 thought it was a good idea to partner with him in the first place			1
but with all of that being said , i doubt his intent behind the commercial was to demonize black men			0
and that 's the difference : intent			2
a commercial that uses stereotypes has the potential to make any minority group featured in it uncomfortable , but is the @entity3 commercial really on par with , say , " @entity118 , " a film that blatantly uses disparaging caricatures of black men to slander and promote fear ? no , it is n't , so can we please step back from the ledge ? in fact , i would dare say the images of black men in many of @entity130 's movies , which are widely supported by the black community , are far more offensive than what i saw in that commercial			1
why ? because in @entity130 's films , the dramatization is intended to be based in reality , while a thirsty gangsta goat by the name of @entity138 is not			1
thus i find the controversy to be as laughable as the rev. @entity140 saying the @entity141 were bad for children because the purple one was gay			0
you know , sometimes images in pop culture are obviously insensitive or offensive , such as @entity148 usurping the murder of @entity150 to make a vulgar reference about sex			2
and sometimes it 's all one giant inkblot , like a @entity156 test			0
no right or wrong answers , just a peek inside the skull of the people who consume pop culture			0
i ca n't help but feel it 's a sad , sad day when the policing of comedy gets to the point where we ca n't even laugh at a talking goat			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			1

@entity171 checked out the @entity3 ad everybody says is racist
he does n't get why it 's offensive , he said ; it 's just silly and absurd and not serious
comedians like @entity46 push racial boundaries all the time , @entity179 says
he *writes* that it 's sad it 's come to this : laughing at a talking goat is *unacceptable*
