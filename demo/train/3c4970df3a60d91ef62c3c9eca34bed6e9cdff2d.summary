-- a story about @entity2 allegedly saying animals can go to heaven went viral late last week			1
the problem is that it was n't true			0
many erroneous news reports on this incident relied on an article that appeared in the @entity9			1
that article alleged that the @entity2 , at a general audience at the @entity11 , comforted a boy whose dog had died by saying : " one day , we will see our animals again in the eternity of @entity17			1
@entity18 is open to all of @entity20 's creatures			0
" this was not what happened , and in a ( frankly , embarrassing ) correction now appended to that flawed article , the @entity9 points out : " the article also misstated what @entity2 is known to have said			2
according to @entity26 , @entity2 said : ' the @entity27 teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us , ' which was interpreted to mean he believes animals go to heaven			1
" ' so : wrong and wrong again			0
but even the correction at the @entity9 and elsewhere ( including this news site ) did little to stop the initial report of the story from zinging around the @entity38 and giving new , unfounded hope to animal lovers everywhere			1
this fiasco illustrates three things : first , while i know it 's tempting to write punny headlines like " dogs in heaven ? pope @entity2 leaves @entity52 open , " news organizations that ran the erroneous account really should hold fact checking to a higher standard			1
note to writers : do n't rely on @entity54 as a source for papal quotes			0
second , part of the reason this story caught fire is that it sounds like something @entity2 would say			1
in his two years as the leader of the worldwide @entity64 , @entity2 ( who took the name of @entity67 , the church 's patron saint of animals ) has prioritized the lowly			1
by extension , he must love puppies and kitties , right ? as @entity77 of @entity78 points out , this is n't the first time such a myth about this @entity2 has spread			2
last year , news reports said he was sneaking out of the @entity11 at night to feed the homeless around @entity83			1
a nice thought but also not true			0
" the media and the public are so primed for @entity2 to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out ; it fit with the pattern , " @entity77 writes			1
the " animals can go to heaven " meme also paints @entity2 as a stirrer of theological controversy , which brings me to my third point : people have strong feelings about whether they will spend the afterlife with their deceased , beloved pets			1
this is where i should be honest and admit i 'm not the world 's biggest animal lover			0
a bite when i was a young child instilled a lasting fear of most dogs , especially big ones			0
but i have loved some animals , including my sister 's dog , @entity112 , who died earlier this year			0
lots of friends tried to comfort her with the " rainbow bridge " story , which says that animals wait in a heaven - like place to be reunited with their owners in the hereafter			2
this is definitely not @entity126 teaching , but its popularity reveals the desire of people to believe that their pets ' lives have meaning			0
while the @entity133 , which contains official church teaching , does not address the issue directly , it does make clear that animals do not have the same immortal souls of humans and thus would not be eligible to enter the @entity52 , so to speak			1
the catechism says we should not mistreat animals , but points out that @entity20 made them for humans ' stewardship and that we should not " spend money on them that should as a priority go to the relief of human misery			2
one can love animals ; one should not direct to them the affection due only to persons			0
" the quote that " paradise is open to all of @entity20 's creatures , " which was mistakenly attributed to the current @entity2 , is now being attributed by the @entity9 and others to a previous one , @entity155 , who died in 1978 -- although the attribution here is also not particularly decisive			1
even if it were , just because a pope says something does n't mean church teaching has changed			0
my apologies to all the animal rights activists , vegans and everyone who has ever lost a pet who got so excited yesterday			0
while @entity64 believe that their leader is infallible , that doctrine is a lot more complicated than meaning that everything that comes out of the @entity2 's mouth is the gospel truth			2
also , it 's important to note that @entity155 's alleged comments apparently were in response to a young boy whose dog had recently died			2
in the @entity64 , we call that being pastoral			0
in other words , the @entity2 was trying to comfort the boy and provide solace , not doctrinal instruction			2
what is true is that @entity2 has been vocal about the importance of caring for creation			2
the source of this whole controversy was a late november talk about how the @entity193 will result in a " new creation			0
" but neither he nor pope @entity155 went so far as to ascribe eternal souls to animals that would be comparable to humans			1
but , as this whole incident illustrates , people will believe what they want to believe .			0

@entity202 : news reports said @entity2 told boy dogs go to heaven ; report proved untrue
story went viral because it fit pattern of *pronouncements* many expect of @entity2 , she says .
claims are that @entity155 said something more like that , not @entity2 , she says . either way **...**
**...** *catholic* catechism clear : animals do n't have immortal souls for heaven entry , she says
