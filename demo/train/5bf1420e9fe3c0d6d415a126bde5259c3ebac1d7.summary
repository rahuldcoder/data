-- ever dreamed of driving through a traffic - free @entity1 ? it 's possible when you step outside the typical summer season			1
in fact , winter 's embrace means a slackened tourist pace in many popular warm - weather destinations , so this is an ideal time to explore @entity10 's open roads			1
witness @entity11 grow an icy exoskeleton as the river persists out of sight			0
in @entity18 's @entity17 , the low winter sun creates optimum conditions for photographing the mighty sandstone sculptures , even prettier with a dusting of snow			1
out east , the @entity23 and @entity24 compensate for southerly latitude with frosty altitude and leafless , ice - glistened forests			1
just remember , winter driving brings its own set of cautions : the more majestic the conditions , often the more dangerous the road , especially when tooling along unfamiliar routes			2
from @entity35 fjords to @entity37 's high desert pueblos and covered - bridge country in @entity39 , here are @entity10 's top winter drives you 'll want to experience before spring			1
@entity17 , @entity18 starting point : @entity44 , @entity18 the @entity45 : 36 miles on the park 's @entity46 what to expect : beautiful any time of year , @entity17 's natural sandstone sculptures assume an ethereal quality when covered in a layer of snow and bathed in soft winter light — best for desert photography			1
the scenic drive is paved , and even after a storm , snow usually melts off quickly			0
where to stop : @entity60 daytime temperatures ( usually in the mid- 40s ; dress in layers ) invite a walk along the @entity64 , a stroll right through the @entity66 , and a pause to marvel at @entity68			0
@entity69 , @entity70 starting point : @entity72 , @entity46 the route : 40 miles on @entity74 what to expect : the temperatures may hover around zero , but the striking , stratified land formations that draw summer thousands remain steadfast — and look even more photo - worthy in a dusting of seasonally light snow			2
you wo n't find many other travelers poking about , so it may just be you , the park rangers , and a whole bunch of bighorn sheep			0
where to stop : any of the 14 scenic overlooks to watch the sun and shadows play tag on the badlands , even if it is a wee bit nippy out there			0
@entity96 : most romantic winter destinations @entity98 , @entity99 starting point : @entity101 , @entity99 the route : 60 miles on @entity103 what to expect : few @entity10 beaches compare to @entity106 in winter , where the snow filters through the dune grass and gathers on the beach like a monk 's mandala			1
@entity113 hopping out , but if you want to stick to your car , a brief one - mile stretch between @entity115 and @entity116 offers the most scenic views			2
where to stop : at any beach access point , massive black - and - white eiders ( sea ducks ) floating aloft the breakers and gulls battling head down into the bracing wind inspire us to dig into the sand and forge forward			2
@entity130 strolls through @entity131 and @entity132 offer additional protection for the birds — and you			0
@entity136 , @entity39 starting point : @entity138 , in the route : 24 miles on the @entity45 ( looping through @entity140 and @entity141 via @entity142 and @entity143 ) what to expect : @entity136 's vibrantly red , covered bridges contrast sublimely with its snow - filled meadows , especially when reflected in the ice that stalls the river below			1
thirty - one covered bridges cross the rivers and streams here , and this being @entity154 country , seeing horse - drawn carriages trot through them only adds to the atmosphere			2
each of five well - known driving circuits takes in at least half a dozen of the photo ops			2
where to stop : the @entity164 is haunted — a young girl and her uncle heard horse hooves approaching on the bridge , but the buggy never materialized , so it 's said — which makes for a spooky stop on a full - moon night			1
@entity96 : compare cruise ships @entity174 , @entity175 starting point : @entity177 , @entity175 the route : 40 miles on @entity179 what to expect : @entity174 provides the @entity181 with its own @entity98 experience , a series of coastal towns , local shops , and individually - owned restaurants that invite winter escape			1
like those who dive headfirst into the @entity106 , the bravest winter adventurers make it all the way to @entity192 at the top of the peninsula			2
where to stop : @entity196 contains 38 miles of trails , many of which are groomed for cross-country skiing			0
@entity201 , @entity202 starting point : @entity204 , @entity202 the route : 27 miles on @entity206 and @entity207 - 50 what to expect : mountains reflect off one of @entity10 's deepest lakes , filling the glassy surface with otherworldly imagery during any season , but especially resplendent in winter			1
bring your camera and your skis , be they @entity217 or alpine			0
you 'll also find plenty of beaches from which to look upon some of the planet 's clearest water			2
where to stop : @entity226 , part of the 14,300 - acre @entity228 , is an ideal place to dip your hands in the icy lake ( it never freezes but does get as low as 37 degrees ) , before hitting the trails for a winter walk , snowshoe , or ski			1
@entity96 : @entity10 's most scenic roads lakes to @entity238 , @entity239 starting point : @entity241 , @entity239 the @entity45 : 190 miles on @entity242 what to expect : following the @entity245 from the confluence of the @entity247 and lesser - known @entity248 , through historic @entity249 and a score of other @entity252 villages , this @entity244 provides plenty of history and scenery before arriving at the @entity256 and @entity257			1
where to stop : history buffs make a point to stop at @entity249 , among the most impressive structures that remain from the 18th century			2
though widely associated with the @entity263 , the fort was actually built by the @entity264 during the @entity265 in the 1750s			0
@entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 starting point : @entity271 , @entity268 the @entity45 : 81 miles on @entity207 and @entity272 what to expect : as you drive toward @entity276 , @entity252 , @entity274 provides a wintry window into the southern alpine wilderness , with ( often snowy ) trails leading through stands of leafless frost - glistened forests			0
best to keep two hands on the wheel and pull over to admire the subtle 4,928 feet of @entity284			0
where to stop : few people from outside the @entity70 will believe you went skiing in @entity268 , so seize the opportunity at @entity271 resort			0
short on time ? the 2.1 - mile - long @entity289 up there is a scenic treat in itself			0
@entity292 , @entity293 starting point : @entity295 , @entity293 the @entity45 : 52 miles on the @entity296 what to expect : @entity292 's summer traffic jams thin out to lightly populated wolf - spotting groups and the occasional bachelor bison ( older males that have left the herd ) that may have you applying the brakes			1
you can drive into the @entity305 to look for wolves , but bisecting the park to @entity308 requires booking space on a snowcoach ( reserve early )			0
where to stop : the geysers look more impressive during winter than any other season so prioritize a stay in @entity316			0
ski , snowshoe , or walk upon miles of trails through the @entity320			0
the @entity321 to @entity322 , @entity37 starting point : @entity324 , @entity37 the @entity45 : 52 miles on six state highways ( 503 to 520 , 76 , 75 , 518 , and finally 68 ) what to expect : a two - hour journey into high desert beauty begins when you turn off @entity207 - 285/84 about 17 miles north of @entity330 : dry snowflakes hang on junipers and piñon pines as you travel past the 14th - century @entity334 and wood - carving village of @entity336			1
later , the snowcapped @entity337 rise in the eastern distance , more than 13,000 feet in height , as the valley spreads below			0
where to stop : @entity342 , located in @entity343 , offers a prime example of a mid- 18th - century adobe church , one of several along @entity347			1
