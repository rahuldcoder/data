-- @entity1 admits he has no idea why it took him 17 years to release a new studio album			1
he also admits he was in no rush to do so			2
" we continued to sell records from our touring , and we were really in this sort of magical place where we did n't have to make records until i really wanted to , " said @entity1 , 66 , in an interview with @entity0			1
" i 've recorded lots of projects , but just have n't bothered to release them			2
" " bingo ! " , however , is not remaining on the shelf			2
@entity19 's first new studio album since 1993 's " @entity20 " hits stores on june 15 , and sees @entity1 embracing the blues music he immersed himself in growing up in @entity23			1
" bingo ! " features his interpretations of tracks like @entity29 's " @entity26 , " @entity25 's " @entity30 " and @entity32 's " @entity31 " -- the album 's first single			1
" this is my pop music			0
when i was a kid this is what i was listening to on my car radio -- @entity37			0
" " tramp " is another one of the 10 songs on " bingo ! " ( a special edition includes four bonus tracks and expanded artwork			1
) however , @entity1 cautions fans this is n't a traditional " covers " album			1
" i did n't just want to do a cover of somebody 's record , " said @entity1			1
" i wanted to get some material and make it my own , and these songs all lent themselves to that			1
" @entity1 recorded " bingo ! " at @entity55 ' @entity54 in @entity56			1
in fact , he cut 42 tracks in all during the sessions there , some of which he says will end up on a second album that has no set release date at this point			1
@entity1 says " bingo ! " can also be considered a " guitar player 's album			1
" " lots of lead guitar and cool guitar parts have been worked out			1
it just got better and better and better as we worked on it , " he said			0
indeed , one of the guest artists on the album is renowned guitarist and 15 - time @entity78 nominee @entity77 , who trades solos with @entity1 on " @entity26 " and @entity32 's " @entity80			1
" " he just plays beautifully , " said @entity1 about his fellow guitarist			1
" it blows your mind when you hear him			0
he is a monster guitarist -- a wonderful musician			0
" @entity1 says the feedback to " bingo ! " has been entertaining to say the least			1
" when we first took the record around to play it for different record guys there were a bunch of young people who really did n't know these songs who said , ' did @entity1 write all those			1
? ' it sounds just like the @entity19 ! " reaction from fans has been gratifying as well , according to @entity1			1
he is in the midst of what has become an annual summer tour of @entity101 and has been giving audiences a sneak preview of the tracks on the new album , mixed in with hits like " @entity107 , " " @entity108 , " " @entity109 , " " @entity110 , " and " @entity111			1
" " the audiences nowadays are really hipper than they were in the mid ' 90s			1
when our last record was out we 'd say , ' ok , we 're gon na do a few new songs from our new album " @entity20			2
" ' 5,000 people would get up and leave and go get a hot dog until they heard me start the opening riff of " @entity108			0
" it was such a conservative audience , and now the audience is much more interested in the new music			0
" @entity1 thinks the reason behind this is the role the internet has played in the music industry			1
" we now have the ability to hear so much more music , " he said			0
" i find that a lot of kids today , their musical horizon is as broad as mine was when i was a kid			2
i was exposed to jazz and blues and gospel and country music and rock , and i was the only kid i knew who knew about that stuff			0
" however , @entity1 says the meshing of the music world and digital world has been a curse along with a blessing , and he feels that it has hurt the industry and its audiences			1
" we 're putting people out of work , " he said			0
" it 's very frustrating to have someone like ( @entity158 co-founder ) @entity159 portrayed as this great genius			0
at the same time he 's a thief , he 's creating machines that steal things			0
thirty years from now the people who created the computers we 're using will all be indicted for destroying everybody 's hearing and for stealing music and intellectual property			0
but at the same time , we 'll know more			0
it 's as damaging as it is enabling			0
" an @entity158 spokeswoman refused to comment on @entity1 's remarks			1
@entity1 says he spent $ 700,000 in two years making " bingo ! " he predicts no one will follow that business model again because the popularity of downloads ensures musicians wo n't be able to make a profit off it			1
@entity1 says touring is ultimately the most foolproof way he has of making a living			1
" i 'm ok , i have this huge live audience and you ca n't copy my show			0
if you want to see what it 's like to see human beings play this music right in front of you for real , you have to buy a ticket			0
that 's the only thing that we really have left that ca n't just be copied and spread over the place -- actual live performance , " he said			0
@entity1 grew up in a musical family			1
his mother , @entity199 , was a singer and his father , dr. @entity200 ( @entity200 ) @entity1 , was an amateur tape recordist			2
a young @entity1 even learned some chords from his father 's friend , guitarist @entity203			2
however , he says he realizes not everyone has a chance to get that kind of exposure to music at home			0
so he 's devoting part of his summer tour in support of " bingo ! " to raise money for a new music education initiative			2
the " text to donate " campaign benefits the @entity220 music education programs at the @entity221 in @entity222 , @entity56			0
@entity1 helped start the programs 11 years ago , and says that during that time 12,000 young people have received free and low - cost music lessons			2
" what i 'm trying to do is build these schools in everyone 's community , " said @entity1			2
" it costs about half what a @entity232 would cost to build			0
if folks really want music in their community they can do it very cheaply			0
it does n't have to be a $ 50 million program			0
all we need is just a little real estate			0
" during his shows , @entity1 is encouraging people to donate by texting rock to 50555			2
a one - time $ 10 donation is then added to mobile bills			0
the fruits of the @entity220 program are also on display during @entity1 's summer tour			2
two of its students are joining the @entity19 at a handful of shows to play guitar with the band for a bit			2
" the guitars look huge on them and they play on a couple of tunes and just knock everybody out ! "			0
