-- officials with @entity3 's interim government are reassuring the @entity4 that their religious views are moderate , after the country 's interim leader called for the country 's new laws to be based on @entity10 , or @entity12 law			1
at a rally on sunday in @entity16 , @entity14 leader @entity13 said , " as a @entity12 country , we have adopted the @entity12 @entity10 as the main source of law			1
accordingly , any law that contradicts @entity12 principles with the @entity10 is ineffective legally			1
" @entity13 also suggested in his speech that he would like to see new @entity12 rules implemented to limit how banks charge interest , and put an end to some of the @entity29 - era restrictions on polygamy			1
" the law of marriage and divorce , which deals with polygamy -- this law is against @entity12 sharia , and is now halted , " he said			2
that kind of talk could raise concerns among the fledgling government 's @entity40 backers			1
in many @entity12 countries , @entity10 law forms the basis for the constitution , but is interpreted moderately			1
but in some , such as @entity47 and @entity48 , it is seen as grounds for cutting off the hand of a convicted thief , or even stoning a woman to death for adultery			2
secretary of state @entity56 , visiting @entity55 just last week , offered a warning when she was asked whether there should be a role for @entity12 in the new @entity3			2
" groups and individuals who really believe in democracy should be welcome into that process , " she said			0
" but groups that want to undermine democracy or subvert it are going to have to be dealt with -- by the @entity3 themselves			0
" but @entity3 's ambassador to the @entity68 , @entity67 , says the @entity4 should not be alarmed			0
" @entity10 law , @entity12 law , it is not against democracy , it is not against equality , is not against the relations with the other countries based on interests and respect and cooperation			1
" he says that women now enjoy new rights since the end of @entity29 's regime			0
" there is no restriction against @entity3 women to do anything now in @entity3 , " he says			0
and @entity13 on monday quickly reassured the international community that @entity3 are moderate @entity12			2
@entity90 spokeswoman @entity89 said , " we were encouraged to see president @entity13 make a clarification			2
" but she reiterated a warning to @entity3 and other @entity12 countries in transition , saying that " the number one thing is that universal human rights , rights for women , rights for minorities , right to due process , right to transparency be fully respected			1
" @entity13 's embrace of @entity12 's role in @entity3 comes just as voters in neighboring @entity107 handed a victory to the moderate @entity110 party @entity109			1
" @entity12 is clearly going to play a much stronger role across the region , " says @entity111 , a @entity112 expert at the @entity113			0
" whether it 's @entity107 , @entity3 , @entity118 , and beyond -- as countries redefine their political systems , they are going to want to use the values of their faith to help define what they want next			0
but that does n't mean necessarily they 're going to be rigid @entity110 regimes			0
" still , she says , @entity3 women are very concerned about equal rights in the @entity132 era			0
" the idea of allowing polygamy again -- or allowing the husband to marry again without asking permission of the first wife -- is something that is going to really resonate throughout @entity3 , " she said .			0

@entity14 leader @entity13 said : " we have adopted the @entity12 @entity10 as the main source of law "
that kind of talk could raise concerns among the fledgling government 's @entity40 backers
in many @entity12 countries , @entity10 law is interpreted moderately
but in some , such as @entity47 and @entity48 , it is interpreted and enforced strictly
