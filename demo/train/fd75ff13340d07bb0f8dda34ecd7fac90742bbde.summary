-- politics might well be a dirty game , but in @entity5 where allegations of vote - buying , sex scandals and violence are a feature of the political landscape , a group of disaffected activists have distilled these predictable shabby tricks into a popular card game			1
called @entity15 , players are asked to woo voters with cash handouts , use elements of @entity20 law to lay low rivals , or pour petrol subsidies on troubled electoral waters			1
cook up a sex scandal to alienate your enemy 's supporters - or to betray your own allies ! " says the game 's website			1
" choose from 10 distinct ( and familiar ) political parties to lead to victory			0
play with up to six friends , of any race			0
but are they really your friends ? remember : it 's not about the people -- it 's about @entity44 , " it adds , referring to @entity5 's administrative capital			1
the tongue - in - cheek game is loosely based on @entity46 but instead of dealing in property , players compete to get voters - the first to hold eight voter cards gets elected to parliament			1
before that can happen , players must negotiate the pitfalls of the " scheme " cards - either rising on the pork - barrel politics of free highway tolls and urban metro projects , or falling on crumbling allegiances and misplaced racial scapegoating			1
typically , the richest person at the card table gets to deal the first card			2
in an ironic twist , the game has even become popular with some politicians in @entity5 's ruling @entity69 coalition , according to the group that developed the card game			1
the brainchild of 31 - year - old designer @entity73 - part of a group called @entity75 , which is affiliated with the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) - the game has quickly sold out of its initial run of 850 decks			2
" i had the idea about two years ago when there really was a political circus going on - we had some ridiculous things happening in @entity5 , " @entity73 told @entity0			1
" you had people being arrested for the color of their t - shirts and things like that and to me that period was really absurd			2
" it prompted a lot of emotions in a lot of people and it 's being expressed in different forms			0
if you have @entity5 friends you can see it on @entity102 and online - i think there 's a creative expression tsunami going on , " he said			1
@entity5 media reports say about 2.6 million of the country 's 13.3 million eligible voters will cast their ballots for the first time in a bitterly fought poll that could see the ruling @entity111 ( @entity111 ) coalition - which has been in power for 56 years - lose to opposition parties for the first time			1
the number of new voters , many of them without party loyalties , has increased markedly since elections five years ago when there were 638,000 new voters			0
analysts say that many young voters may have been encouraged to register by the closeness of the 2008 poll which the ruling coalition only narrowly won			0
" we do n't have a reliable mainstream media in @entity5 , " said @entity129 , a communications officer with @entity76			1
" the government owns pretty much all newspapers , all radio stations and tv stations			0
a lot of people are now relying on social media and alternative media that can be found with online newspapers and the like			0
" websites such as @entity141 have become popular with young voters , streaming news and views generally unobtainable in @entity5 's mainstream press			1
even so , it claims that it has been the victim of censorship tactics that have involved denial of service cyber-attacks on its streaming videos			0
the @entity152 investigating the attacks said there were no such restrictions , adding that the public should not speculate until a proper investigation has been carried out			0
the power of the online campaign has not been lost on the ruling coalition which this year launched the @entity161 ; a team of 2,000 of what it calls " cyber-activists " tasked with logging opposition attacks			0
on sunday , voters will be asked to choose between the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) coalition , which -- with its predecessor -- has ruled the country for more than five decades , and @entity171 ( @entity171 ) , a loose coalition of opposition parties formed after the last election in 2008			2
@entity111 is led by prime minister @entity175 , the son and nephew of former prime ministers , who has held the post since 2009			0
@entity171 is headed by @entity179 , a former finance and deputy prime minister who served time in prison on corruption and sodomy charges which he says were politically motivated			0
the first sodomy charge was overturned in 2004 and in january 2012 he was acquitted of a second charge of sodomy , a serious offense in @entity5 which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison			2
in a hard - fought campaign , both parties have been trying to entice voters with promises of generous government spending .			2

tongue - in - cheek card game is based on @entity5 dirty politics
players must out - scheme each other to be voted into parliament
*contestants* are asked to buy votes , hire phantom voters and control the media
in an ironic twist , the game has become popular with some @entity5 politicians
