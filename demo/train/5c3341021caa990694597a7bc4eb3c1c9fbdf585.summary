-- as a fiction writer , i struggle to tell useful truths by telling the lie that i am someone other than myself			2
i 'm a fat girl trying to survive rape in my first novel , the resentful brother of a mentally ill twin in my second			2
in my third novel , which i 'm close to finishing , i 'm the husband of a drug - addicted nurse lost in a maze of her failures and fear			1
author @entity17 says writing personal stories can free you from painful memories and imprisoning secrets			1
writing fiction invites me to move beyond the limitations of my own experience and better understand the un-me , the other			1
i am similarly invited to do so each time i go to jail			2
for the past eight years , i have run a writing workshop for inmates at the @entity31 , @entity33 's high - security prison for women			1
someone asked me recently if i ever felt afraid of my students			2
our class , after all , includes individuals who have committed armed robbery , gang - related assault , and homicide			1
but no , i do n't fear these women , because through their autobiographical writing , i come to know them not merely as their convictions but as complex human equations that go far beyond " good versus bad " or " us versus them			1
" listen to the voice of one of my students			2
" i am @entity50 , who has been a healthcare worker , a business manager , a homemaker , a gardener , and a killer -- and who is consequently a state prison inmate			1
" molested by her grandfather when she was 4 , @entity50 shot and killed her abusive husband when he revealed that he had molested her granddaughter			2
convicted of " manslaughter due to emotional duress , " she challenges readers to think beyond stereotype			1
" i am sure you have a dark side , too , " she writes			2
who would ever have thought that @entity66 , an average neighbor from rural @entity33 , could be capable of murder ? " @entity0 : how to make peace with your past most of my students begin as you might begin : by writing safe pieces -- narratives about fun family vacations , loving tributes to favorite relatives			1
but sooner or later their painful memories call to them and demand to be examined			0
with pen in hand , an inmate may , for example , begin to explore the connection between the incest she endured as a young girl and her subsequent drug addiction			0
she may discover a link between her embezzlement conviction and her lifelong inability to please an emotionally distant mother			0
along with that growing clarity , she will confront anger , shame , grief , and the need to stop making excuses and take responsibility			0
doing so will lessen her heartache and promote her recovery if she stays with it , but she may surrender to the pain before she gets to experience the gain			0
she may become too busy , too tired , too headachy , too blue to come to class			0
before long , her seat will go to the next woman on the waiting list			0
addicts are particularly vulnerable to cold feet when truth telling begins to overpower manipulation and self - deception			1
yet if the writer reflects honestly and un-self - pityingly on the damage she has both endured and caused -- and if she takes the critical next step of sharing her words with the group and receiving feedback -- she will begin to defy the gravity of her painful past			1
but a person need not go to prison to access the therapeutic value of autobiographical writing			1
which of us has not put walls and razor wire around our concealed sadnesses and past regrets ? who among us was raised by a perfect family ? who does not have hilarious , life - affirming stories to share and debilitating secrets to dispel ? which of us is so self - aware that we could not reveal ourselves more deeply by reflecting on our lives with fingertips on the keyboard -- and then sharing our discoveries with other writers and bearing witness to theirs ? in doing so , we discover that " the other " and we are more alike than different , variations on a theme of humanity and circumstance			1
@entity147 , the 16th - century artistic genius , once said this about his work : " i saw the angel in the marble and carved until i set him free			1
" my inmate students , you , and i are damaged angels - in - waiting who have the potential to sculpt our best selves with the aid of paper and pen			1

and as that happens , we rise above the concrete and razor wire of painful memories , baffling personal mysteries , and imprisoning secrets			0
our load lightens , our perspective changes			0
