@entity0 -- a @entity0 inventor who photographed @entity3 33 years ago hopes those images will now help launch an electric motor he claims could solve the world 's energy problems			1
@entity8 will use cash from the sale of 130 unpublished @entity3 photos to fund testing of the motor , which he claims generates more electricity than it uses			1
@entity8 is in the process of getting the photos appraised and prepared for sale			2
the photos show a 19 - year - old @entity3 and his brothers during a video shoot at a @entity22 studio in march 1978 , before he began changing his appearance with surgery			1
the @entity27 hair style and 1970s clothing show " a rare glance " of @entity3 in an " awkward teenage stage , " an image that he personally tried to bury in later years , according to a collector who sold photographs to the singer			1
" if it was an image he did n't like , he was more likely to buy them than if they were images he did like , " said @entity34			0
" were he alive now , i would definitely go to him and i 'm sure he would want to buy them			0
" with @entity3 gone , @entity34 's @entity39 is buying the image copyrights and helping @entity8 sell the original slides , prints and contact sheets that have been forgotten on his shelf for decades			1
@entity8 pulled the box of photos out of his closet last month when he was looking for ways to finance testing of his " self - generating " motor , @entity8 said in a @entity1 interview this week			1
" he was the greatest guy you could ever talk to , " @entity8 said of his day with @entity3			1
@entity8 was a student at @entity54 and a freelance photographer when a friend of his sister 's , who worked for @entity58 , asked him to take pictures of the @entity60 at @entity61 in @entity22 , he said			1
the color photos show the @entity60 dressed in blue tuxedos , singing on a soundstage			2
the black - and - white images were taken during breaks in the video shoot , @entity8 said			2
" i sat him in front of a mirror and shot some photos , and i said ' act like you 're reading a letter like you just got from your girl , ' " he said			0
the result was a photo showing @entity3 and his reflection in a dressing room mirror			0
@entity8 said he only recently realized it echoes the singer 's later hit " @entity81			0
" @entity8 and business partner @entity82 brought his photos and the prototype of his invention to @entity1 's @entity0 bureau to demonstrate the engine and talk about their plans			2
" what we 're essentially looking for is trying to take the photos that @entity94 took of @entity3 , his legacy , use those funds to try to take our prototype to the market and ultimately clean up the environment and use less greenhouse gases as a result of a motor that 's very highly efficient , " @entity90 said			1
the motor buzzed as two voltage meters measured the energy going in and the power flowing out , back to the battery			0
" it 's generating more energy recharging the battery than it actually draws from the battery , " @entity82 said			0
@entity8 reconfigured the brushes and rewound the copper in a standard motor " so it captures the negative electromagnetic field as it collapses , sends energy to a capacitor and recharges the battery , " he said			2
the sale of the @entity3 photographs will allow them " to certify that the prototype does everything that we say it 's going to do , " @entity82 said			0
" it 's written in the stars , " @entity8 said			0
" we have a destiny of a greener earth , a door opening today that should lead us to this clean earth			0
