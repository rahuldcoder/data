the @entity1 's most expensive weapons program ever , the f - 35 warplane , is cleared for takeoff again			1
the limited flight clearance , approved by @entity5 and @entity7 officials monday , allows the aircraft to fly with an engine inspection regimen and restricted flight envelope following the fleet 's grounding after an engine fire last month			1
@entity1 spokesman @entity14 said in a statement tuesday the restrictions would " remain in effect until the root cause of the june 23 engine mishap is identified and corrected			1
" it had been hoped that the stealth fighter would be able to make an appearance at the famed @entity24 air show , under way now , but @entity1 spokesman rear adm. @entity26 said tuesday afternoon that wo n't happen			1
" the @entity1 , in concert with our partners in the @entity32 , has decided not to send @entity34 and @entity35 aircraft across the @entity36 to participate in the @entity24 air show , " he told reporters			1
" this decision was reached after a consultation with senior leaders and airworthiness authorities , despite the decision by airworthiness authorities to clear the aircraft to return to flight -- to limited flight			1
" the 2014 @entity47 began monday , and runs through july 20 in @entity24 , @entity48			2
the opening day brought $ 42 billion of orders and commitments for commercial aircraft and engines , according to a statement from the show 's organizers			0
the @entity57 was developed at a cost of nearly $ 400 billion so far and beset for years by cost overruns and delays			0
the so - called @entity57 was temporarily grounded following a fire on the runway at @entity63 in @entity64			1
engine maker @entity66 worked with @entity7 investigators to inspect all engines in the fleet			2
" we have great confidence in the @entity76 engine powering the @entity57 , and we have worked very closely with @entity1 and the services to return the aircraft to flying status , " @entity70 , communications manager for @entity71 , said in a statement tuesday			1
the @entity57 's lead contractor , @entity81 , which is producing variants of the plane for the @entity5 , @entity34 and @entity7 , also worked with investigators following the fleet 's grounding			1
@entity57 future the @entity1 wants more than 2,400 of the fighter jets ultimately , while hundreds more are expected over time to go to allies such as @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			2
more than 100 planes have been built so far , most for testing , but the program is still in its development and training phases			0
the military says the stealthy fighter will be " the most affordable , lethal , supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used " by so many services worldwide			0
but its production has been controversial for its soaring cost history -- the price tag has nearly doubled from early estimates , to $ 135 million per unit as of last year , according to a @entity108 report in march -- as well as its schedule , software and other setbacks			0
test flights began in 2007			0
while all models have been grounded in the past for various problems , the version for the @entity34 , the @entity35 , has had more issues			0
experts say that 's mainly due to its design for shorter takeoffs and vertical landings			0
@entity124 , a @entity125 analyst , said earlier this month that every component of the f - 35 overall " is pushing the frontiers of technology " as engineers combine extraordinary engine power with a lighter weight design			2
he said the program has made gradual progress in recent years where glitches get resolved pretty quickly compared with 18 to 24 months ago , when setbacks seemed to come one right after another			0
" it 's a tremendously complex project , " he said , adding that cost issues remain a concern .			0
