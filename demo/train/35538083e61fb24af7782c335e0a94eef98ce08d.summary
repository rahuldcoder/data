-- does @entity1 really have more than 500 million " active " users ? according to data from digital - legacy planning firm @entity4 , a big portion of these users will soon no longer be considered " active , " by any reasonable measure			1
the company compared @entity1 usership data with average death rates from the @entity12 , and discovered that this year , around 480,000 @entity1 users may pass away in the @entity14 , and 1.78 million worldwide			1
these figures are only likely to grow year to year , especially as @entity1 expands pass the 600 million user mark			2
so many profiles now fall out of the range of an " active " user			0
beyond the deceased , there are endless duplicate accounts -- @entity4 found that 150 % of 20 - to 24 - year - olds in the @entity14 are on @entity1 -- not exactly a plausible tally			1
@entity0 : the facebooks of @entity25 what 's more , a recent @entity27 report estimated that in the coming years , roughly one in every ten of your friends on @entity1 and other social networks will be nonhuman , meaning they 'll be " social bots , " automated profiles created by brands and organizations to engage consumers			1
with profiles of the departed presumably being left untouched , with social bots soon to be plaguing the network , and with duplicate accounts running amok , how can facebook ever provide an accurate " active " usership count ? for the deceased , @entity1 has created a system of " memorializing " accounts , which adjusts a profile 's privacy settings to be seen only by confirmed family and friends			1
immediate family members may also request the removal of a loved one 's account			0
but the onus is on the deceased 's relatives -- if the " memorializing " feature is not activated , @entity1 will continue to assume the profile still represents an active user			0
the same assumption goes for duplicate accounts as well -- @entity1 relies on users to merge accounts and report fake profiles			2
to address this issue , @entity1 has defined an " active " user as one who has logged in within the last 30 days			0
thus , a month after a user passes away , that user is no longer considered " active , " appropriately			0
for organizations and businesses registered for the social network , @entity1 distinguishes their accounts as " profiles " rather than " user pages , " and does not count them as active users			1
@entity0 : a graphic guide to @entity1 portraits but for duplicate and fake accounts , keeping them accountable is more difficult , as users might be willing to log in to multiple accounts			2
so while the company 's latest partner @entity83 has been boasting of @entity1 's 600 million - plus userbase , it 's unclear just how accurate those figures will be if investors -- and advertisers , for that matter -- ever choose to parse the details			0
