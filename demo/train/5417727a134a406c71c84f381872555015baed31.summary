-- the reviews of the new @entity2 are in and many , including one from widely respected @entity4 , sound a similar theme : the tablet is quite good -- better than the original @entity2 -- but still no @entity7			1
@entity4 tested the 7 - inch fire hd , which is the same size as the current @entity2 and is scheduled to ship on friday			1
they did n't get their hands on the bigger , 8.9 - inch version that ships on november 20			0
" the @entity14 may not meet the company 's goal of creating ' the best tablet at any price , ' our tests suggest			1
but it 's a fine performer that improves markedly on the first - generation @entity23 , " reads the site 's review			1
@entity24 : a comparison leading the @entity4 review was a positive take on the tablet 's new screen			1
" in particular , glare is reduced over the hd 's predecessor , creating a screen that 's among the easiest to read in bright light among tablets we 've tested			2
color fidelity is also a step up on the old @entity23 , though it 's still a little behind the third - generation @entity7 screen , which has the highest color accuracy we 've measured on a tablet , " it read			1
also earning high marks were its 8 hours of battery life , improved access to cloud storage , and the addition of a physical volume button and camera -- two knocks against the original @entity23			1
like its predecessor , the 7 - inch @entity2 sells for $ 199 ; the bigger version will go for $ 299			0
that 's $ 200 less than the similarly sized @entity7 and $ 100 less than @entity55 is currently asking for a version of the ipad 2			2
@entity4 said it found " no major flaws " with the new @entity2 tablet			1
but what it called " quibbles " included the lack of a fully stocked app store , lack of a memory card to add to its @entity68 or @entity69 of memory and the fact that the advertised prices are for a " special offers " version that includes ads. ( ad - free versions are available for $ 15 more )			0
" while our tests continue , the @entity2 shows every sign of being a very worthy tablet			0
it 's also attractively priced ( despite our quibbles ) , costing less , for example , than a @entity68 @entity83 7 , even if you add the cost of a charger and the no - special - offers upgrade , " @entity4 said			1
hands - on with the new @entity89 the @entity4 review is in line with many others published since @entity93 introduced the device last week			1
@entity95 of @entity96 called the tablet a definite step forward from the original @entity23			1
" the original @entity2 felt like an experiment , a ' can we do this ? ' moment for @entity93 , " he wrote			0
" the new , $ 199 fire hd feels like something very different			0
a product with an attitude , a directive , a plan			0
and that plan seems to be something like this : hit them on price , hit them on ecosystem , and hit them where it hurts the most -- product design			0
" but like others , he notes that , when stacked up against the @entity7 and @entity122 's @entity121 , the device " still has a long way to go			2
" " i think it can get there , but it is n't there yet , " he wrote			0
at @entity129 , @entity128 called the @entity2 " a great tablet and a great value " while @entity130 of the @entity131 said the device is " not a disappointment " but falls well short of @entity93 ceo @entity134 ' lofty goal of creating " the best tablet at any price			2
" " the @entity14 models are attractive , confident viewers of movies , tv shows , web pages and books			2
they tap into @entity93 's increasingly appealing online world of entertainment and information stores			0
and above all , they make the @entity2 's industry - leading features - per - dollar ratio even more top - heavy , " he wrote			0
" but ' the best tablet at any price ? hmmm			2
somebody should put a call in to the @entity159 water inspectors			0

reviews : the @entity14 is a good tablet but not the " best at any price "
@entity4 gave it a *thumbs* - up , citing improvements on the original
reviewers like screen and physical improvements , such as camera and volume button
still , compared to an @entity7 , the @entity23 hd is " not there yet , " some say
