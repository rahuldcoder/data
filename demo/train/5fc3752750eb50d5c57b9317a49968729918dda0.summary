@entity13 was a suspect in the 2009 disappearance of his wife , @entity19			1

@entity13 's death was ruled a suicide , while his sons ' deaths were determined to be homicides			1
@entity13 first gave toys and books to charity , sent multiple goodbye e-mails and doused the @entity0 , @entity1 , home with gasoline before setting it ablaze , authorities said monday			1
that evidence suggests that @entity13 planned a murder - suicide for some time , @entity15 said			2
" he was making arrangement to leave this place , so he had some knowledge of what he was going to do , " he told @entity2 's @entity47			0
" ( @entity52 ) believe this was intentional -- it 's two counts of murder and then suicide			0
" it was a tragic development in a puzzling case that began two years ago in the @entity61 suburb of @entity62 , @entity63 , when 28 - year - old @entity19 disappeared			1
@entity65 interviews @entity19 's sister before he set fire to his home , @entity13 sent his attorney an e-mail saying simply : " i 'm sorry			1
" he also sent e-mails to his pastor and others just minutes before the fire , giving instructions on how to handle his end - of - life business , according to @entity15			1
@entity13 donated his sons ' toys and books to a local charity , seemingly to clean house , he said			1
the spokesman added that authorities found two five - gallon cans of gas in the home , one of which appeared to have been lit right next to the bodies , which were found together in the same room			0
the sheriff 's department has copies of an e-mail @entity13 sent to his attorney as well as family and friends that said " he could n't live with what was going on , " @entity15 said			1
the deaths of the @entity1 man and his two sons may mean the disappearance of the children 's mother may never be solved			2
still , the case remains open and investigators vowed to pursue it until the point of closure			0

a team of detectives was sent to @entity1 in the aftermath of the fatal fire			0
" the case is still active ; we 're not closing the case			0
we still got things that have not been resolved , " he said			0
@entity13 , who was never charged in his wife 's disappearance , was embroiled in a bitter custody dispute with her parents			1
" words ca n't describe any of this ... i ca n't imagine any of us going through what @entity142 and @entity143 have gone through , losing their daughter and losing these dear little boys , " attorney @entity133 , who represented @entity134 and @entity135 in the disappearance of their daughter , told @entity140 's @entity139			2
the children , at least the older boy , @entity26 , had reached the age where they may have been giving away information , @entity133 said			0

if we go to the mine , we 'll find mommy , ' " she said			0
authorities have searched mines in @entity63 and @entity162 for @entity19 , @entity133 said			1
when asked monday whether she feared @entity13 would ever hurt his children , @entity19 's sister , @entity163 , responded : " absolutely			1
" " from the get go , from when he was named a person of interest , the boys should have been taken away from him , and he should not have been allowed visitation , " she told @entity140 's @entity65			0
the children had started " opening up and talking to my parents about what happened that night , " in recent months , she said			0
" the boys really , once they started opening up to our family , they started closing down on their dad , " the sister told @entity140			0
according to investigators , @entity13 had said the last time he saw his wife was the night he and his sons -- then ages 2 and 4 -- left to go camping			2
@entity19 's sister eventually reported her missing			1
a month later , @entity13 and his children moved from @entity63 to @entity1			1
as late as last month , @entity63 authorities were still working to connect @entity13 to the disappearance of his wife , who authorities believe is dead			1
the weekend 's tragic events appeared to have been set in motion days earlier when a judge refused @entity13 's petition to regain custody of his children and instead ordered he undergo psychological evaluations -- an order that came after authorities turned up child pornography in the home @entity13 shared with his father			2
as part of the investigation into @entity19 's disappearance , @entity63 authorities searched the @entity1 house where @entity13 , his two sons and his father , @entity204 , were living last year			1
during the search , investigators " discovered numerous images and recordings of adult and juvenile females , " according to a statement released by the @entity16 sheriff 's department			0
@entity13 's father , @entity212 , was subsequently charged with 14 counts of voyeurism and one count of possessing images of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct , according to court documents			2
after the arrest of @entity13 's father , custody of his sons was given to the @entity115 , according to @entity1 state court records			1
@entity13 maintained in court documents filed last week that he established his own home after his father 's arrest and " have consistently proven my fitness as a stable and loving parent under close supervision by ( child welfare caseworkers )			2
" " the real story is not that anyone is a bad person , including me , " @entity13 said in the affidavit			2
" the story is one of overcoming and rising above what many people think are insurmountable challenges			0
" on sunday , shortly after noon , @entity13 was standing outside his home in a quiet , tree - lined @entity241 waiting for a social worker to bring the two boys for a supervised visit , authorities said			2
as the children got to the door , @entity13 pushed the social worker back , quickly brought the two boys inside and locked the door			2
the social worker , who later reported smelling something similar to gas at the time , tried " pounding the doors , trying to get in , " said @entity255 , a deputy chief with @entity256 , @entity1 , @entity257 and @entity258			0
about two minutes later , as the social worker was calling her supervisor , the house exploded , @entity255 said			0
the powerful explosion shook houses , with debris landing on lawns blocks away			0
@entity266 , who lived near the @entity13 home , was making coffee in the kitchen when the explosion violently rattled windows and doors in her home			0
" it really hurts my heart			0
my heart ached for those boys anyway , " she told @entity2 affiliate @entity275 , wiping away tears			0
