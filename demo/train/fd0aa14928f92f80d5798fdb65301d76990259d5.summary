-- @entity1 , one of the social network 's most popular features , is getting a big and potentially controversial upgrade with a new feature that automatically suggests who users should tag in photos based on facial recognition technology			1
the new feature , @entity12 , will begin rolling out to @entity14 users next week , according to @entity15 vice president of product @entity16			1
he told us that the product utilizes technology that was built in - house , as well as some technology that came from partners			0
@entity16 did not disclose the partners @entity15 worked with for @entity12 , although we have our suspicions			2
whenever you 're offered the chance to tag groups of your friends in an album , @entity15 will utilize its facial recognition technology to group similar faces together and automatically suggest the friend you should tag them with			1
@entity15 fills in the " who is this ? " box with its suggestion -- all you have to do is click the " @entity41 " button to accept			0
@entity16 says that suggestions will only appear when its algorithms have " high confidence " of who 's being suggested			1
unlike @entity46 , @entity15 does n't reveal its certainty level and would n't reveal what percentage actually correlates to " high confidence			1
" the social giant is also preemptively addressing the potential privacy issues that will be brought up from automatic , algorithmic tagging			0
users can opt out of @entity54 by going to their privacy settings and disabling the " suggest photos of me to friends " feature			0
this release is part of a bigger effort to upgrade @entity1			0
earlier this year , @entity15 launched a slew of upgrades , including bigger thumbnails , group tagging and drag - and - drop photos			2
this may be the biggest upgrade for photos yet , though			0
photo tagging is considered a chore by many users , yet it is the company 's most popular product			0
" photos are by far the most engaging content @entity15 has ever had , " @entity16 told us earlier today			2
by vastly simplifying the tagging process , @entity15 expects that its millions of users will tag more photos , which will create millions of new engagement points and social connections , making it that much more addicting			1
