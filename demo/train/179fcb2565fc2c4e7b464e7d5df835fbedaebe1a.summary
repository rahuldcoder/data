-- @entity2 @entity1 have said no to any piece of legislation related to immigration that extends beyond border enforcement			1
most recently , they killed the @entity7 ( it stands for @entity9 ) with a filibuster and balked at the late - hour introduction of a comprehensive immigration bill by sen. @entity13 , @entity14			1
the conventional wisdom has been the @entity1 's position was a good short - term strategy that would mobilize the @entity19 movement in a climate of left - of - center malaise and reinforce @entity1 ' seemingly inexorable november landslide			1
there is good reason to believe , however , that obstructing @entity25 on immigration will hurt the party in this election and in the long - term			1
with the rise of @entity32 voters in the @entity33 , obstructing immigration reform could cost the @entity1 votes on tuesday and any chance of winning back the @entity37 in 2012 and beyond			2
the @entity7 is as @entity33 as apple pie			2
behind it is the uncontroversial idea that we do not hold children accountable for their parents ' actions			0
its basic premise is to offer a path to citizenship to children whose parents brought them to this country with or without their consent			0
in our broken system , once they grow up , these children face deportation to countries they have never known			0
under @entity9 , they would earn their citizenship by going to college or serving in the military , the latter option being the reason that @entity2 majority leader @entity59 appended dream to a defense bill			0
@entity9 's message is practical and straightforward : encourage children of immigrants who have grown up in @entity33 to continue studying ( good for the economy ) or join the military ( good for national defense )			0
but the @entity1 said no , as it said on energy spending , financial regulation and health care			2
on its face , this has just been the most recent episode in the @entity1 's broader strategy -- block @entity74 efforts and then denounce the @entity74 as incapable ideologues			1
the difference on immigration is that @entity1 said no while many simultaneously began supporting nativist state legislation , first in @entity80 and then in more than 20 other states			1
the combination of saying no on @entity9 while saying yes to laws that raise the ugly specter of racial profiling has caught @entity32 voters ' attention			0
recent polls show that @entity32 concern about immigration is up			0
moreover , since the @entity7 was introduced in mid-september , @entity92 polls have found that @entity32 voters have become more likely to cast ballots on tuesday			2
although @entity96 remain displeased that @entity74 have not passed immigration legislation , the same polls revealed increased @entity32 awareness of @entity1 ' obstructionism and @entity74 ' efforts			1
moreover , a @entity102 poll found that registered @entity32 voters are three times as likely to vote for @entity74 candidates for the @entity106 ( 65 percent @entity74 to 22 percent @entity1 )			1
these factors will likely have short - and long - term consequences			0
in the short term , the @entity1 's intransigence on dream and active promotion of @entity80 's law and copycat laws have made the case to @entity96 more forcefully than @entity74 ever could about the need to vote on tuesday			1
@entity96 are the single - largest ethnic minority in the @entity33 , and increased turnout in support of @entity74 could reduce @entity1 gains in the @entity37 and @entity2 this week			1
long - term , there 's recognition in some corners of the @entity1 that being the party of " no " and " get out " is a losing proposition			1
in the 1960s , the party lost @entity128 - @entity33 voters by opposing civil rights legislation , and they have never been able to bring them back			2
today , they risk losing @entity96 in the same way			2
latino voters are like other voters			0
they generally care more about the economy more than anything else			0
in fact , @entity1 have an ideological advantage with many @entity96 because of the party 's close ties to @entity140 conservatives			1
president @entity141 won a majority among @entity143 in 2004			0
but the party has squandered this advantage by turning immigration into a top issue in @entity96 ' consciousness			1
a recent @entity149 poll shows that immigration is now of at least equal concern to @entity32 voters as the economy , and concern over discrimination and racism has surged			0
republicans should be concerned not only about @entity32 voting patterns in this election , but also about how their current position affects their chances of competing in future presidential elections			0
if @entity96 come out as strongly for the @entity74 in november as they did in 2008 , cooler heads in the @entity1 may prevail and press for compromise in the lame - duck session and the next @entity25			1
presidential aspirants , too , may push for an immigration solution in 2011 so that the issue fades away before the next primary season pushes candidates back toward the right			0
finally , business leaders could play a key role in pushing the @entity1 to their senses			2
right - wing groups such as the @entity177 are already on the right side of this issue			0
even @entity179 , whose @entity180 continues to spew bile on immigration issues , has come out publicly for immigration reform			0
but the ability of these figures to wrest back control of the @entity1 position in 2011 all hinges on tuesday 's vote			1
if the @entity37 returns to @entity1 control , it 's hard to imagine rep. @entity192 -- who would become @entity193 -- helping the @entity1 retreat from the precipice on immigration			1
a @entity192 - led @entity37 could block any forward progress until at least 2013			0
for @entity74 , the longer - term silver lining of continued @entity1 obstruction would be the further alienation of @entity96 from the @entity1			1
the short - term tragedy , though , would be at least two more years during which our immigration system would remain broken and 11 million immigrants would remain undocumented in this country , living on the margins of our society without the rights that their neighbors enjoy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity213 : @entity1 has opposed any immigration legislation beyond border control
he says party helped kill @entity7 as part of strategy to *thwart* @entity74 agenda
@entity96 see @entity1 's position , he says , and it could hurt the party in **midterms** and beyond
@entity213 : if @entity96 vote for dems in **midterms** , @entity1 may *decide* to deal on immigration
