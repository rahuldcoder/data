@entity0 -- declaring the @entity3 goal is a successful @entity4 , president @entity5 on monday promised economic , diplomatic and military help to @entity4 prime minister @entity7 after the last @entity3 troops leave the @entity10 nation by the end of the year			1
the two leaders met at the @entity13 and held a joint news conference to declare the eight - year war formally over now that @entity3 troops are completing their withdrawal this month			1
they then proceeded to @entity18 in @entity19 for a solemn wreath - laying ceremony to pay respect to the war dead			0
@entity5 said the end of the @entity4 war means a new chapter in @entity3 - @entity4 relations , with a focus now on a " normal relationship between sovereign nations			1
" he told the visiting @entity4 prime minister the two nations will build " a comprehensive partnership " that includes trade relations , support for building up @entity4 's democratic capacity and military - to - military ties aimed at helping @entity4 rebuild its air force , which was destroyed in the war against @entity41 's regime			1
" our goal is simply to make sure @entity4 succeeds , because we think a successful , democratic @entity4 can be a model for the entire region , " @entity5 said			1
after the meeting , @entity47 spokesman @entity46 announced the @entity3 government 's intention to sell 18 more @entity52 fighter jets to @entity4 , doubling the initial sale of 18 announced earlier this year			1
@entity7 said he is committed to building ties			0
" the relationship will not end with the departure of the last @entity3 soldier , " he said			1
at the same time , the @entity4 leader insisted his country now is completely reliant on its own security apparatus , with the help of training by @entity3 and @entity64 forces			2
" we have proven success			0
nobody imagined that we would succeed in defeating terrorism and @entity69 , " @entity7 said			0
also monday , @entity64 announced it is withdrawing training forces from @entity4 by december 31			2
a @entity64 statement said " robust negotiations " on extending the @entity64 training mission failed to reach agreement			0
the unresolved issue was granting foreign forces immunity from local prosecution , officials said			0
the same issue stymied earlier talks between the @entity5 administration and @entity7 's government about the possibility of some @entity3 training forces staying longer than the deadline for withdrawal set in an agreement dating back to the @entity89 administration			1
both @entity5 and @entity7 have political reasons for ending the @entity3 military presence			2
@entity5 pledged during his 2008 campaign to bring @entity3 troops home from @entity4 , while @entity7 faces internal opposition to the foreign military presence			1
more than 4,400 @entity3 troops were killed and thousands more were wounded in the war that began in 2003			1
@entity4 casualties are estimated to exceed 100,000			2
some @entity3 conservatives oppose the end of the @entity4 operation , arguing that the withdrawal of @entity3 forces leaves @entity4 vulnerable to political instability from internal forces and neighbors such as @entity106			1
" domestic political considerations in each country have been allowed to trump our common security interests , " sen. @entity107 , @entity108 , said in a statement			0
" all of the progress that both @entity4 and @entity3 have made , at such painful and substantial cost , has now been put at greater risk			2
i hope i am wrong , but i fear i am not			0
it did not have to be this way , and the fact that it is has everything to do with a failure of vision , commitment and leadership both in @entity0 and @entity125			0
" as of sunday , 6,000 @entity3 troops and four @entity3 military bases remained in @entity4 , according to col. @entity128 , spokesman for the @entity129 in @entity4			1
the four bases are : @entity131 in @entity132 , about 20 miles south of @entity125 echo in @entity134 , about 110 miles south of @entity125 adder near @entity136 , about 200 miles southeast of @entity125 @entity137 in @entity137 , about 340 miles southeast of @entity125 @entity4 faces many challenges as @entity3 troops pull out , ranging from human rights issues to oil deals to national stability			1
@entity5 said monday that the @entity3 wants to help @entity4 " ramp up oil production " and is " helping to encourage international investments in that sector			1
" he also said some military - to - military ties will continue , similar to @entity3 links with some other countries , and there " may be occasion for joint exercises			2
" the @entity3 goal " is a sovereign @entity4 that can protect its borders , protect its airspace , protect its people , " @entity5 said			1
for his part , @entity7 told reporters he requested military hardware from @entity5 , including the f - 16s to help rebuild the air force			0
" definitely we have raised the issue of the @entity4 need for weapons for area protection , naval and ground protection , " @entity7 said			0
" we have a lot of weapons , @entity3 weapons , and it requires trainers			0
and we received promises for cooperation from his excellency , the president , for some weapons that @entity4 is asking for , especially those related to its protection of its airspace			2
" some analysts fear that violence could spike in @entity4 as groups struggle over power in the wake of the @entity3 troop withdrawal , and that the decreased @entity3 presence could allow @entity106 to increase its influence			1
@entity186 , a @entity89 administration deputy national security adviser for @entity4 and @entity187 from 2004 to 2007 , wrote that there is " reason to worry " in a recent analysis for @entity191 posted on @entity1 's @entity193 blog			0
" the foundations of the @entity4 state remain shallow			0
divisions within @entity4 's ruling elite run deep , " wrote @entity186 , now a professor at the @entity196 at @entity197			0
" a continued @entity3 military presence would not have guaranteed peace and prosperity , but its removal increases the risks of failure in @entity4 by eliminating the psychological backstop to a still delicate political system and by kicking open the door more widely to foreign interference			2
" @entity3 officials have insisted the drastic pullback of troops does not mean an end to the @entity3 government 's presence in @entity4			1
hundreds of nonmilitary @entity3 personnel will remain in @entity4 , including 1,700 diplomats , law enforcement officers and economic , agriculture and other professionals and experts , according to the @entity222			2
in addition , 5,000 security contractors will protect @entity3 diplomats and another 4,500 contractors will serve other roles , such as helping provide food and medical services , until they can be done locally			0
future @entity3 involvement in training for @entity4 troops is also a possibility , @entity3 officials have said			1
officials and analysts have said the impact of the @entity3 presence will echo for years to come			0
" @entity4 , @entity3 and the world ultimately will judge us far more on the basis of what will happen than what has happened , " @entity239 , then - @entity3 ambassador to @entity4 , said in 2008 congressional testimony			2
" in the end , how we leave and what we leave behind will be more important than how we came			0
" @entity1 's @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
