@entity1 , @entity0 -- the future of design could see the divide between able - bodied and disabled people vanish			1
a toilet for all : the " @entity8 " caters for able - bodied and people in wheelchairs			1
@entity12 , design professor at @entity14 in @entity15 , and the author of '' @entity17 , '' is issuing a challenge to designers and engineers across the world : create things that work for everyone			1
" it is about time we designed things that can be used by all people -- which is the notion behind accessible design			1
designing for people with disabilities almost always leads to products that work better for everyone			2
" once the champion of human - centered design -- where wants and needs of individuals are the primary consideration in the design process , @entity12 now believes accessible activity - centered design is a better approach			1
this approach creates designs by looking at the job a person needs to achieve in using a particular technology			2
@entity12 told @entity2 that including disabled people in this thought process would create better technologies for all people , regardless of their level of ability			1
" make cans and bottles that a one - handed person can open and guess what , many people will find it makes their lives easier when they only have one free hand			1
" showers and baths can be made better and safer for all			0
make things better for the hard of hearing or seeing and guess what , similar benefits for all , " he said			0
and technology like this is already being developed			0
@entity73 designers @entity74 and @entity75 have come up with the " @entity8 , " an invention that could end the need for separate able - bodied and disabled toilets			1
tell us your ideas for machines or objects that could be adapted to suit disabled and able - bodied people			1
despite such innovation , @entity12 said there would still need to be a shift in the mindset of many major companies			1
" the most important first step is to increase the awareness of designers and companies of the need to accommodate everyone			0
the disabled are not just some small , disenfranchised group : they represent all of us			0
so the first step is education , awareness , and empathy			0
" a change in the thought process of designers would also require support and active participation of people with the disabilities being designed for , he said			1
@entity12 also hoped for some more care to be taken with these designs			1
" finally , why are so many aids so ugly ? why ca n't we rally the design community to make beautiful , elegant canes , walkers , wheelchairs , and other items ? " such an approach would aid the work of organizations like the @entity123 , and @entity126 's @entity125 company @entity124 , which specializes in inclusive interior design to meet the functional and aspirational needs of older consumers			1
@entity12 felt some of the best designs in existence were simple and very old			1
he believed computers are actually restrictive when it comes to being creative			0
" pencils and small pieces of paper are two of the best objects designed			0
when you take our computer tools they do n't allow us such flexibility			0
the good technologies are bringing that flexibility back			0
" he said producing good designs was about making the object understandable , and not trying to base the design on a certain way in which people should use the technology			1
" what we should do is understand the job the person is trying to do			0
do n't try to predict what a human will do			0
you will get it wrong , " he said			0
some of @entity12 's favorite technologies of the contemporary era include the @entity164 , navigation systems in cars , and @entity167 with the option of being able to select driving or walking			2
he is not a big fan of the @entity173 's design , and believes it has been successful primarily because of excellent marketing , the @entity176 , and other extras which can be bought to accompany the @entity173			2
@entity12 was also supportive of users of technology could have input into how it functioned			2
he said ' mass customization ' where designers offer the purchaser the opportunity to add a personal touch to goods was increasingly common			0
" i think it 's quite rewarding letting people design their own things			2
" so , what does he see occurring in the future ? @entity12 said he was excited about 3d printing and the possibilities that could one day open up			2
" i can imagine in the future if i was after something like a new dish - mat , i will be able to buy it online and by printing it it gets manufactured in my own home			0
" he envisaged being able to purchase the raw materials for such items and then input them into the machine .			0
