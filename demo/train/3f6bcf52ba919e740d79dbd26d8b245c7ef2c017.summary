-- " who do you want to see ? " asked the @entity3 holding their @entity4 at the gate			0
" @entity8 leaders , " i replied			1
" @entity8 ? why not our @entity11 brothers ? " the guard asked			1
" well , @entity8 are in government in @entity14			1
" " they wo n't be in future , " he responded			2
" they have sold out and become agents of the @entity20 , and in years to come we will govern @entity14			0
be sure to meet our brothers here in the camp , too			0
" the guard then gave me directions to a safe house where someone could take me to @entity8			1
i was visiting a @entity30 refugee camp in @entity31 for book research			0
it took me two more days to locate @entity8 leadership			1
inside the camp , just as in @entity14 , @entity8 had a wide network of schools , financiers , mosques , makeshift hospitals , readily available doctors , banking services , and support for orphans and widows			1
we in the @entity47 deem @entity8 a terrorist organization			1
yes , one part of it is committed to terrorism , killing innocent civilians in the pursuit of political aims , but we are mistaken if we continue to limit our definition by one aspect of @entity8			1
unless we better understand @entity8 , we can not help halt the killings of @entity20 and @entity58 in the @entity59			1
@entity8 is not a monolith , nor is it only a terrorist group : it is a social movement , with a mass membership , a popular message of resistance that resonates across the @entity68 world , and a political party with which we must negotiate			1
" when the @entity20 were fighting @entity73 and the @entity74 , the @entity58 were losing , " the @entity8 leader -- whose name i must withhold -- told me			1
" we saw them abandon anti-aircraft missiles here in @entity31 in the 1980s			0
but now , with @entity77 and @entity8 , we fight to die , to kill			1
we do n't flee from the battlefield			2
" to my @entity8 hosts , @entity20 's operation in @entity81 in 2006 , or its attack on @entity14 in 2009 , were huge victories			2
" we are now winning			0
we fight @entity20 and want to fight again and again			0
" this strong belief that they are victorious is in itself a loss for @entity20 : it has failed to weaken @entity8			2
fighting and killing have been a curse to @entity20 's existence over the last six decades			0
the trajectory has been to make @entity20 weaker and more hated around the world ; to popularize the ideology of radicalism amid @entity98 and fuel anti-americanism in the @entity59			2
@entity20 can not kill itself into security or survival			0
it must learn the language of peace and co-existence			2
for how much longer will we in the @entity47 continue to damage our own standing in the nearly 2 billion - strong @entity68 world as our ally @entity20 delivers dead children and destroyed schools to @entity68 television screens ? @entity20 killed @entity8 founder @entity112 in 2004 , along with several bodyguards , and then his successors , promising us that this would help reduce violence and terror			1
almost a decade later , @entity8 is not only strong and vibrant , in government since 2007 , but lobbing rockets at @entity119 and kidnapping @entity20 soldiers			2
in short , @entity8 is strong and growing psychologically stronger , while @entity20 has failed to achieve its peace and security			1
worse , contrary to what many believed , @entity8 was not weakened when @entity125 's president @entity124 , a supporter , was toppled in july 2013			1
@entity124 made many mistakes , but president @entity128 's telephone calls to him helped bring @entity8 to the table and secure a cease - fire in 2012 much sooner			2
@entity20 does not deserve all the blame			0
@entity58 political and religious leaders , despite historic grievances , have a duty to recognize that @entity20 is their neighbor			0
@entity20 is part of the mosaic of the modern @entity59			0
a change in tone and tenor and a public embrace of @entity20 by religious leaders will calm the nerves of an anxious @entity20 population			0
in the end , @entity20 has limited options			0
peace is not possible without @entity8 , and @entity8 is not a simple terrorist outfit			1
its political arm , its leadership inside and outside @entity14 , despite their tensions , are open to indirect talks with @entity20			1
just as the @entity155 and @entity156 governments negotiated peace in @entity158 by reaching out to @entity160 terrorists through their political wing of @entity162 , we must tame @entity8 through politics , not the failed strategy of war			1
@entity8 and @entity166 were among the @entity30 groups that met in @entity168 and reached a 72 - hour humanitarian cease - fire agreement brokered by @entity125 officials			2
here , the @entity171 and the @entity156 can work through @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and negotiate along the 2002 @entity58 peace plan suggested by @entity175			0
@entity8 must be brought in			2
almost 2 million people in @entity14 need our support			0
if we fail to bring in @entity8 and create a sustained peace that leads to prosperity for @entity30 and @entity20 , then we must prepare for an enemy who is worse : @entity182			1
and with @entity14 , the popularity of the @entity185 message will spread far and wide			0
my guard at the refugee camp insisted i speak with his brothers - in - arms			0
i did not , but i fear he might be right			0
will @entity20 help itself and us , or hinder ?			0

@entity193 : @entity8 is not just terror group : it has schools , banks , mosques , doctors
@entity193 : west damages standing in @entity68 world as tv shows dead children , blasted schools
peace is not possible without @entity8 leaders , he says , who are open to indirect talks
@entity193 : if we do n't deal with @entity8 , we might have a worse enemy : @entity182
