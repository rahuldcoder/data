@entity0 want the state of 2016 play in @entity4 ? the @entity6 comeback strategy ? how the @entity7 will handle the @entity9 visit ? take our sunday trip around the " @entity13 " table : it 's no secret the @entity7 is miffed that @entity15 prime minister @entity9 accepted an invitation to address @entity17 and make his case about the @entity20 nuclear negotiations			1
less clear , though , is how the @entity7 will react -- or not -- during the prime minister 's stay in @entity0 next month			1
@entity23 of @entity24 took us inside the @entity26 deliberations : " on the one hand , they do n't want to just cede this space to @entity9			1
he 's got the speech to @entity17 and a big speech to @entity30 , " said @entity23 , referring to the @entity30			1
" on the other hand , they do n't want to get into this public tit and tat , where you 've got @entity9 speaking and @entity39 responding			1
" so basically expect the cold shoulder approach , explained @entity23			2
" no meetings with @entity9 , no big speeches by the president , " she added			1
" but there is certainly some pressure from certain corners of this administration to be more aggressive , be more vocal ( and ) do n't just sit back			0
" @entity48 has kept a very low profile so far this year , by design			1
she has no serious competition as yet for the @entity53 presidential nomination and has been out of the public eye working on her team and strategy			0
she 's been so quiet , in fact , that @entity58 almost daily complain she is hiding and ducking big public policy debates			1
well , hiding is n't going to work in the week ahead			1
@entity61 of @entity62 offered her reporting on an upcoming series of @entity66 events : " in 2008 , @entity48 ran on her resume and her experience , not this idea of her being the first woman president , " explained @entity61 , adding that the result of that strategy ended up with @entity39 becoming the candidate of hope and change and @entity66 becoming the candidate of the past			1
but according to @entity61 , @entity66 's advisers have resolved to do it differently this time , starting with a preview of that new message on tuesday , when she will address a conference of women in technology			2
" i think it will be fascinating to watch how she talks about gender , leadership and family issues that have become a major tenet of the @entity53 -- and it will certainly give us a preview of campaign themes to come			0
" @entity94 of the @entity95 was in @entity4 last week to accept the first @entity96 from the @entity97 at the @entity98			2
@entity96 and @entity94 were friends and colleagues -- and there is no one more deserving of the award honoring the @entity105 - winning reporter and columnist who died in 2011			0
and , of course , in true @entity108 style , @entity94 took advantage of the trip to do some reporting on the current state of 2016 play in the first - in - the - nation primary state : " i do n't think we 've ever seen a race in @entity4 as wide open as this , " @entity94 said enthusiastically			2
" somebody said you can throw a blanket over this field and they 're all below 16 or 17 % , " he added , referring to potential @entity58 presidential candidates			2
" this was not a good week for @entity127 gov. @entity6 in national political circles or newspapers			1
much of the buzz was about how @entity6 was being outhustled by potential rivals @entity132 and @entity133 , and both the @entity95 and the @entity134 ran front - page stories on friday suggesting the @entity127 governor was having a hard time gearing up for a 2016 presidential run			1
( @entity140 story was written by " @entity13 " regular @entity141			0
) it is worth noting that the buzz in @entity4 was more favorable ; several sources there told me @entity6 's recent trip there was well received			1
but the national conversation is n't so great , and @entity141 reports that @entity150 believes the best way to change the conversation and get back on offense is for the governor to go back to his day job and make an impression			0
" he has a big budget speech in @entity158 on tuesday			0
and then he 's going to try to go on a town hall , his first since last year , and really get back to the extemporaneous @entity6 , the gregarious @entity6 that made him such a popular figure within the @entity58 , " said @entity141			1
most of those exploring running for president need to make the official decision in the next month or three -- and sen. @entity168 of @entity169 has one of the more interesting calculations to make			2
first there is the @entity132 factor : former gov. @entity132 is the more senior @entity58 player from the state they both call home , and some @entity168 allies worry that @entity132 will be able to soak up most of the fund - raising take available in the state			0
and then there is the current @entity133 boomlet			0
the @entity183 governor is up in the polls of late and occupying the space in the race that @entity168 covets -- the next - generation candidate who is acceptable to the @entity58 's @entity189 base and its more corporate establishment			2
so yea or nay for @entity168 ? he is visiting the first four nominating - contest states this month to assess things firsthand			0
and he continues to add to his fund - raising and political teams so that he is prepared to run if he ultimately decides to take the plunge			0
will he ? one adviser involved in the deliberations put the odds at " 60 - 40 in favor of running			0
" @entity168 has said he will decide by the spring			0
because the other candidates are so active , there is some internal pressure to make his intentions clear soon -- perhaps by the end of march .			0

@entity9 plans trip to @entity0 , but questions *linger* over whether @entity39 will meet with him
@entity48 expected to *embrace* role as potential first *female* president
a bad week for @entity6 , but *whispers* say he 's planning a comeback
