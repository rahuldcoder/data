" what did the @entity24 get ? and more importantly what did those people who are persecuted and whose human rights are violated in @entity5 get in return for @entity24 now opening up its economic and travel doors , and ( granting ) full diplomatic relations with the power and majesty that that has to have an @entity24 embassy in your country , " @entity0 said during the hour - long interview monday night with @entity1 anchor @entity66 on the @entity68 television station @entity67			1

but @entity0 took issue with @entity3 's comment during a year - end press conference that he wished @entity10 had called him before making the decision to pull the movie because theaters were canceling showings			2
" he certainly was briefed about the attack , " @entity0 said of the president			0
" it seems to me that it 's the obligation of the @entity126 to call them			0
" " @entity10 made a mistake by backing off , and i think , quite frankly the president made a mistake by not being assertive , and getting everybody into the @entity13 — from @entity10 , and the movie theater companies that @entity10 was complaining about , and the intelligence community — and say ' @entity133 , what 's the nature of the threat and what can we do to stop it			2
