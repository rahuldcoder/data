@entity0 -- for those who worked the beltway sniper case in @entity0 a little more than a decade ago , the manhunt for a highly trained gunman suspected of targeting cops and their families in @entity6 has some startling similarities and clear differences as well			1
in the @entity6 case , the mood is tense among police officers as they continue the search for @entity15 , who is suspected of killing three people to settle a score for what he called an unjust firing from the @entity21			1
similar fear gripped the @entity0 - area for nearly a month in october 2002 , when @entity24 and @entity25 terrorized the city and its suburbs during the sniper case			1
they operated out of an old sedan , firing from a hole in the trunk , and struck in broad daylight and at night			2
they randomly gunned down 13 people , killing 10 and wounding three , going about their daily routine -- never suspecting for a second that they were in the sights of a killer			2
they were each felled by a rifle shot while at a gas station , doing yard work , going to school , or heading into a shopping center			2
police bulletins , road blocks , and false leads and sightings around the notorious shootings fueled drama and tension in a region already on edge over the drumbeat of threats of another @entity56 attack on the capital			2
police were methodical and eventually caught a break , arresting the pair at a rest stop in @entity62			2
the @entity64 case offers some similarities			1
- it involves a manhunt originating in a major metropolitan area with reported sightings in different communities raising fears			1
- the case involves multiple victims in multiple attacks			1
- @entity15 was in the @entity75 and served in the @entity76			2
@entity24 , who was executed in 2009 , was in the @entity77 and also served in the @entity76 , many years before			0
- @entity15 is a trained marksman as was @entity24			1
- schools in some areas where @entity6 searches are concentrated are closed			0
in the sniper case , outdoor public events were canceled			1
@entity64 cops stalked by suspect , and a brutal history but differences between the two cases are clearer and , in some ways , should set the broader public at ease , say former detectives , law enforcement officials and a forensic psychiatrist familiar with both cases			1
" during the @entity0 sniper shooting the public had no idea who was doing it			1
... the public saw this as random victimization without rhyme or reason , " said @entity98 , a forensic psychiatrist			1
@entity98 worked on the @entity0 sniper case as well as the " @entity104 " mail - bomb case			1
" in contrast , in the @entity6 matter , the public understands his targets are much more focused			0
they consist of certain named individuals and their families , " he said			2
@entity15 , 33 , is wanted in the killing of two people in @entity113 , @entity6 , on sunday and in the shooting of three @entity64 - area police officers on thursday , which killed one of them			0
one of the victims in @entity113 was the daughter of a retired @entity64 police officer who @entity15 knows , authorities said			2
the technical details of the @entity6 case may differ , but the level of fear people feel as they listen to accounts of the manhunt for a well trained suspect who authorities say has a vendetta is similarly acute , said @entity133 , a former homicide detective with the @entity134 who worked on the sniper case			1
" crime in general is nebulous or out there but when it strikes next to you , you think ' it could be me , ' " @entity133 said			0
neighbors have echoed that sentiment			0
opinion : in rampages , it 's about revenge " it 's too close to home			0
it 's kind of scary , " @entity15 's neighbor , @entity147 told , @entity148			0
@entity15 , authorities said , is bent on vengeance against @entity21 officers he claims ruined his life by forcing him out of his dream job			0
he detailed his rage in an 11 - page manifesto			0
in that letter -- provided to @entity1 by an @entity21 source -- he vowed to violently target police officers and their families , whoever and wherever they are			2
the motives in the @entity0 sniper case were never entirely clear			1
@entity24 and his accomplice , @entity25 , then 17 , taunted police with written messages , phone threats and demands during the rampage			0
during two trials and in years of appeals , @entity24 had professed innocence			0
another difference is what authorities already know about the suspect in @entity6			1
in the early days of the @entity0 case , there were few clues and many false leads about who was behind the shooting , the type of vehicle involved , and where the suspect or suspects might have been			1
" i was manning the e-mail tip line and there would be hundreds of them , " @entity133 said			0
" there was one where they had the shootings mapped out on an upside constellation of @entity196			0
we had people going around copying down the numbers of white vans and e-mailing them			0
there 's always that concern that they 'll miss that crucial tip because there is so much static			0
" that static complicated matters , @entity206 said			0
" in the @entity0 case , everyone speculated that he had sniper training and that he was a police officer			1
in fact , we got tips about police officers who we had to put under surveillance			0
in @entity0 , anybody could have been a target			1
out there ( the @entity6 suspect ) has a target list but it is obvious that he will kill anyone who gets in his way			2
" alleged cop - killer 's manifesto details threats @entity1 's @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0

similarities but important difference between the @entity231 manhunt and the @entity0 sniper case
suspected @entity231 gunman is targeting cops and their families ; @entity0 sniper victims were random
both the @entity231 suspect and the lead d.c. sniper were *military* *veterans* , trained marksmen
