@entity0 , @entity1 -- substitute @entity2 struck his second hat - trick against @entity0 this season as @entity5 ran riot with a 6 - 2 @entity8 victory at @entity9			1
@entity5 players celebrate @entity12 's goal in their comfortable 6 - 2 victory over @entity0			1
the @entity14 , 5 - 0 winners at the @entity15 earlier in the season , made sure of third place in the table with a rousing second - half display against relegated @entity0 , who move closer to being the @entity8 's worst - ever side			1
@entity23 's side led 2 - 1 at the break after goals from @entity26 and @entity12 either side of a @entity29 effort			2
@entity30 was on target too , but the second half belonged to @entity33 international striker @entity2 , who struck three times to take his season 's tally to 30 in all competitions , with @entity38 grabbing a consolation for the hosts in this eight - goal thriller			1
bottom side @entity0 , now 30 league games without a victory , began the more purposefully and @entity44 only just failed to connect @entity46 ' inviting low cross			1
then @entity48 's drive took a major deflection off @entity50 to wrong - foot goalkeeper @entity51 , making his first league start for @entity5 , only for the ball to creep past the right - hand post			0
the @entity14 struggled to find their rhythm early on and were fortunate not to go behind when @entity44 's bullet header flew just over			0
@entity0 were made to pay for those early misses when @entity59 's 25th minute mistake presented the ball to @entity61 , who played a one - two with @entity12 before coolly slotting the ball into the left corner			2
however , @entity0 soon scored the equalizer they deserved			0
@entity66 's inswinging free - kick landed on the six - yard line and @entity29 reacted first to hook the ball home			0
the home side 's joy was short - lived though , when @entity0 's defensive frailties were exposed again as @entity12 as given all the time in the world to chest down @entity75 's floated pass and volley home in style			2
@entity2 replaced @entity12 for the second - half and @entity5 immediately looked intent on adding to their goals tally			2
twice @entity75 , playing at right - back , fired over , the second opportunity created by @entity85 ' brilliant backheel			0
there was nothing goalkeeper @entity88 could do to deny @entity2 @entity5 's third goal			1
@entity30 took advantage of @entity92 ' slip to cut the ball back to @entity94 , who gave @entity2 an easy finish			0
@entity30 should have made it four when he was put through by @entity26 but the teenager fired wide with the goal at his mercy			0
by now it was looking all too easy for the @entity14 as they toyed with home side , creating chances at will -- but against the run of play @entity0 reduced the deficit to just a single goal when substitute @entity38 stroked the ball home			0
yet within a minute the two - goal cushion was restored , @entity110 pinging a pinpoint pass to @entity30 wide on the left before the youngster cut inside and curled into the top - right corner			0
@entity2 grabbed another poacher 's goal , sliding to convert another @entity110 assist with 10 minutes remaining before he wrapped up his hat - trick from an acute angle in added time			1
with two games remaining , @entity5 are four points behind @entity122 and @entity123 , still with an outside chance of lifting the @entity8 title			1

@entity2 hits hat - trick as @entity5 thrash @entity0 6 - 2 at @entity9
the result follows @entity5 's 5 - 0 win against bottom side earlier this season
@entity5 are four points behind @entity122 and @entity123 with two matches left
