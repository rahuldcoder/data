@entity0 -- nine months after his detention by @entity8 authorities , a prominent @entity5 scholar charged with " separatism " went on trial wednesday amid tight security , his lawyer said			1
@entity12 , an economics professor at @entity0 's @entity13 , was detained by police in january and taken to his native @entity15 , @entity8 's restive northwestern region where a spate of recent violent incidents have been blamed by the government on @entity5 separatists seeking to establish an independent state			1
@entity21 , one of @entity12 's lawyers , told @entity1 earlier this week that he expected the trial to be short at the @entity24 in @entity25 , the capital of @entity15 , and a verdict and sentencing would likely be announced at a later date			1

the authorities cordoned off the street in front of the court wednesday morning , and the area was teeming with uniformed and plainclothes police , the lawyer said online before the trial began			0
although the government charged @entity12 only in late july , @entity15 police said in a statement in january that they had gathered firm evidence of him colluding with overseas forces to " spread separatist ideas , incite ethnic hatred and advocate @entity15 independence			1
" the police statement also said @entity12 had taught students about " violent @entity5 resistance " in his class and encouraged them to overthrow the @entity8 government			1

" he reiterated that he has advocated to improve the rule of law , democracy and ethnic harmony in @entity15 , " @entity59 , @entity12 's other lawyer , told @entity1 earlier			1
" @entity12 has consistently , courageously and unambiguously advocated peacefully for greater understanding and dialogue between various communities , and with the state , " said @entity64 , @entity8 director of the international advocacy group @entity65 , in a statement			2
" if this is @entity0 's definition of ' separatist ' activities , it 's hard to see tensions in @entity15 ... decreasing			1
" @entity59 , the lawyer , also complained about the treatment of @entity12 in jail , saying he was put in shackles again recently after receiving the same treatment for three weeks upon arrival			2
" he went on a hunger strike for some 10 days in january after they refused to provide him with @entity5 food , " @entity59 said			1
" they also denied him food for about 10 days in march after the @entity89 incident , " he added , referring to the stabbings at a train station in the southwestern city of @entity89 that left 29 people dead			0
uyghur separatists were blamed for the attack			0
@entity1 's phone calls to the @entity15 government for comment went unanswered			1
' @entity97 ' @entity12 is known for his research on @entity100 relations and has been a vocal critic of the government 's ethnic policies in @entity15 , a resource - rich region long inhabited by the turkic - speaking , largely @entity106			1
the arrival of waves of @entity109 , @entity8 's predominant ethnic group , over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions			0
some @entity112 have expressed resentment toward the @entity109 majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from @entity8 security forces and loss of economic opportunities to @entity109 people in @entity15			1
@entity121 has said @entity112 face widespread discrimination in employment , housing and education , as well as curtailed religious freedom			0
other critics , including exiled uyghur activists , have attributed the rise of violence in @entity15 to @entity0 's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government vehemently denies			2
in late july , the state - run @entity135 news agency reported that a gang wielding knives and axes attacked civilians , a police station , government offices and smashed vehicles in southern @entity15 , killing 37 people			2
the government called the incident an " organized and premeditated " terrorist attack and said police at the scene shot dead 59 people in the mob and arrested more than 200 , according to @entity135			0
in the region 's deadliest single violent incident in recent history , a suicide bombing in may killed 39 people at a street market in @entity25			0
another apparent suicide bombing left three dead in april at an @entity25 train station			0
the @entity8 government has responded by launching a massive anti-terrorism campaign as well as pouring more economic resources into @entity15			2
last week , four people were convicted of plotting the knife attack at the @entity165			0
three were sentenced to death and the fourth to life imprisonment			0
in june , @entity8 executed 13 people convicted of terrorism charges related to attacks on public places in @entity15 in recent months			0
also in june , a court in @entity25 sentenced three people to death for their roles in a deadly attack in @entity0 's @entity177 last october			0
defendant names revealed by state media all sounded @entity112			0
" the long - term solution to @entity15 's unrest is not further repression , but greater understanding of the @entity106 ' grievances and perspectives , " said @entity64 of @entity65			2
" if @entity12 -- a peaceful , articulate critic -- is given a harsh sentence , what confidence can any uyghur have that their very real grievances will ever get a hearing with @entity8 authorities ? "			0
