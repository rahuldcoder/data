the protesters have been denouncing what they call second - class treatment by the @entity7 - led government			0
they began in late december , when @entity99 took to the streets in @entity110 province , which borders @entity120 and @entity121 , to protest prime minister @entity123 's order to arrest the bodyguards of finance minister @entity125 , a @entity99			1
the arrests came hours after president @entity127 , a kurd who was widely viewed as a stabilizing political force in @entity4 , left the country to undergo treatment from a stroke			2
@entity132 then announced his resignation , effective in march , over the government 's failure to meet the demands of @entity99 demonstrators to end their marginalization , his spokesman , @entity131 , said			2
