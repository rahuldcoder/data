-- @entity3 police detained hundreds of @entity4 following a raid on a suspected people - trafficking camp , police said			1
a @entity8 spokesman said 531 men , women and children were detained following a raid on sunday at a camp near the town of @entity15 in the southern province of @entity17			1
police said they were acting on media reports that @entity4 fleeing sectarian violence in @entity20 were falling into the hands of people smugglers who held them in camps , ransoming them to relatives across the border in @entity27			1
deputy national police chief @entity28 told the @entity29 that three suspected ringleaders -- all of them @entity3 males -- had been detained in the raid			1
he said the @entity32 were being held at an immigration detention center in @entity17			0
" we are interviewing all of them to see if they are victims of human trafficking , " he said			0
" we have to interview them and proceed according to @entity3 immigration laws			2
it will depend on whether they want to go back			0
" if they are willing , we will send them back as we have done before			0
" @entity32 -- stateless @entity44 from @entity20 -- have been fleeing ethnic violence in @entity46 - majority @entity20 , arriving in boats in southwestern @entity3 before transiting to @entity27 where they often work illegally			1
@entity3 's efforts to deport @entity32 -- in some cases allegedly towing their boats back out to sea -- has come under fire from human rights groups as well as the @entity55			1
@entity56 , deputy director at @entity57 , said that human trafficking had been " plaguing efforts to help the @entity32 for the last year or two at least			0
" " when the @entity32 boats started coming out in significant numbers circa 2009 , it was very disorganized , boats were landing everywhere -- this is when the @entity65 were pushing them out to sea			0
" but now these @entity32 that are arriving close to the @entity3 coast are being seized by broker and trafficking syndicates working in collusion with @entity3 officials to bring these people onshore , hold them in jungle camps and then essentially ransoming them			2
" he said in some cases ransom money could be as much 65 - 70,000 @entity3 baht ( us $ 2000 ) -- which represented a considerable amount of money for some of the world 's poorest people			2
" there 's been a long - standing @entity32 community in @entity27 -- they have relative and friends there , there are jobs on offer			2
" he said that once in @entity27 , @entity4 often worked in the black economy doing dirty and dangerous jobs			1
" that 's where the @entity32 are headed to , that 's their promised land in some ways			0
" @entity97 , @entity3 - @entity20 researcher for @entity57 , said that the @entity32 had the " unenviable distinction of being the most blighted " people in @entity20			1
" denied citizenship , subject to tight restrictions on movement , employment and religious freedoms , this @entity44 minority have been the target of abuses by the @entity20 military for decades , " he said			2
" today they face serious risks of state violence and coercion , in part arising from preparations to build a pipeline through their region that will deliver offshore gas to @entity119			0
already reports are emerging of forced relocations and other abuses tied to gas exploitation			0
