@entity6 won the @entity4 last september 2012 as a 25/1 outsider and tested negative for doping after the race			1
his surprise victory denied @entity14 the chance to become the first @entity17 winner since 1970 , with the winner of the @entity19 and @entity20 finishing in second place			0
the feat of winning the three races is so rare that only one horse has achieved it since the second world war - @entity26 in 1970			0
after @entity8 earned an eight - year suspension when he admitted administering banned drugs to 15 horses in his care , the @entity5 undertook further extensive testing at his @entity34 yard			1
the steroid stanozolol was found in a further seven animals , so raising the tally of horses under the trainer 's control to have tested positive for doping to 22			1
in a boost for @entity9 , whose stable was founded by the ruler of @entity45 - @entity44 - in 1992 , testing on nearly 200 horses at their other yard returned no positive results			1
trainer @entity49 , who runs the @entity50 stable in @entity51 , will now take control of @entity34 , the yard formerly licensed to @entity8			2
" we welcome the news that @entity49 's horses tested negative and this clears the way for him to now take charge of @entity34 , " said @entity54 , chief executive of @entity5			0
in a statement posted on @entity9 's website , racing manager @entity60 said : " it is obviously very disappointing that seven further horses have tested positive for stanozolol			1
" these results highlight why @entity44 took the decision to lock down the stables at @entity34 until every @entity9 horse in training at @entity51 had been tested			0
" all of @entity49 's horses have tested clear and we are working with the @entity5 to put everything back in order at @entity34			0
" the @entity5 said no further action will be taken against @entity8 , who has appealed the ban given to him in april and who says he was unaware that the use of anabolic steroids out of competition was banned in the @entity79			1
the practice is allowed in @entity81 and @entity45 , where @entity8 was based prior to taking control of @entity34 in 2010			0
" we will not be taking any separate action in respect of these additional positive results whilst mr @entity8 's appeal process is ongoing , " said @entity83 , the body 's @entity84			2
" in the meantime , the latest findings will form the subject of further interviews as part of the @entity5 's continuing investigation			0
" following testing of 391 horses , the six to join @entity6 in @entity79 racing 's most serious drugs scandal are his full brother @entity101 as well as @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
like the other 15 to have previously tested positive , all the horses will be unable to compete for the next six months at the very least			2
both @entity9 and @entity8 can ask for the samples to be subjected to b sample analysis , with a decision to take up that option required by thursday			0
while no date has yet been set for @entity8 's hearing , which will take place no earlier than the last week of june , those in charge of the @entity114 must be hoping that the worst is now over .			2

@entity4 winner @entity6 is latest horse to be caught up in @entity79 racing 's doping scandal
@entity2 - bred horse is one of seven in yard of @entity8 to test positive
22 horses are now banned for a minimum period of six months
