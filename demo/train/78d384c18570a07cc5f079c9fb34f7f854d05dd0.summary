-- watching the @entity2 recall crisis unfold over the past few months has been like watching a wildfire on a windy day			1
just when it would appear that the flames might be contained , another powerful gust sweeps through , stirring them up and blowing them still higher			2
true , @entity2 has acted as its own arsonist at times			1
if it had attacked the floor - mat entrapment problem as aggressively in 2007 as it is doing now , then perhaps the current crisis could have been avoided			0
and if the company had been acting as a better switchboard operator between @entity14 and @entity15 , it could have more quickly connected the sticking accelerator problems in some @entity14 cars with the fact that the same pedal assembly was used in eight @entity21 models			0
and it might possibly have avoided the recent stop - sale on those models			0
but some of the gusts have been whipped up by the news media			0
the software glitch in the antilock braking system of the 2010 @entity30 and @entity31 , which causes a momentary loss of braking capability , is serious enough that it should be fixed			0
but on an overall scale of recalled problems , it 's relatively minor			1
yet , it continues to grab headlines in this @entity2 - sensitized environment			1
vehicles are recalled all the time by just about every automaker			0
the @entity43 issued 1,399 safety - related recalls affecting more than 38 million vehicles from 2007 to 2009			1
and while @entity2 's inferno has been grabbing the nation 's attention , new recalls have been springing up			1
@entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 have all issued recalls in recent weeks , for problems ranging from faulty power steering to defective air bags			2
and @entity57 issued its own stop - sale on the @entity59 because of a faulty front - door latch			0
yes , the idea of a runaway vehicle is a frightful thought to drivers			0
and we encourage the government to continue to investigate complaints of unintended acceleration			1
but consumers should n't lose sight of two important points			0
such incidents are rare ; the approximately 2,000 consumer complaints received by the @entity43 that were related to unintended acceleration in @entity2 over the past 10 years works out to about one in every 10,000 toyotas sold over that period			1
also , these complaints are n't confined to @entity2			1
in an analysis of 5,916 total complaints filed to the @entity43 database for 2008 models ( as of august 28 , 2009 , before the problem hit the national spotlight ) , we found 166 related to unintended acceleration			1
while ones citing @entity2 - built vehicles made up the highest percentage -- 41 percent -- there were also complaints related to 20 other brands			1
@entity91 vehicles drew the second - highest number at 28 percent			0
still , while there has been unusually strong reaction to @entity2 's problems , such flare - ups can lead to positive changes			1
following the @entity101 tires / @entity99 recalls in 2000 , the government enacted the @entity102 ( @entity103			2
among other things , it mandated tire - pressure monitoring systems in passenger cars and created the @entity109 database , which requires manufacturers to report problem data to the @entity43			2
we 're hoping that the energy surrounding this crisis can be harnessed to improve our auto - safety system so that such rare - but - deadly problems can be caught earlier or prevented altogether			2
to that end , @entity117 is recommending that the government take the following actions : -- improve public access to safety information by making their complaint databases more uniform , user - friendly and easier to search			0
this would help investigators spot a problem trend more easily and perhaps address it before it becomes a crisis			0
-- mandate that cars be required to stop in a reasonable distance , even with the throttle fully open			0
one solution to this is " smart throttle " technology , which disengages the throttle if the brake pedal is depressed			0
it 's being used now by some automakers and @entity2 says such a system will be installed in all of its models by the end of this year			1
-- improve the recall compliance process			0
according to @entity43 , the average consumer response rate to vehicle recalls is only about 74 percent , meaning that a quarter of all affected vehicles never get the fix			2
this puts used - car buyers at unnecessary risk			0
-- give regulators more funding			1
in 2007 , auto crashes made up 99 percent of all transportation - related deaths and injuries			2
yet , @entity43 's budget is just over 1 percent of the overall budget of its parent , the @entity163			0
that 's not enough for the reality of auto safety today			2
despite the tragedies , the @entity2 crisis can yet be a catalyst for positive change that can benefit consumers			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			1

@entity174 : some facts have been *overlooked* in the rush of *coverage* of @entity2
he says some auto defects and recalls are routine and relatively minor
@entity174 says other manufacturers also are subjects of unintended acceleration complaints
good can come out of this if regulators are given more funding , he says
