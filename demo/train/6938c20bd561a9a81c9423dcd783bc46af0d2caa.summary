-- @entity2 will always be known for his consecutive games played streak , but it may surprise many people that just two years into his big - league career , he already was planning for life after baseball			1
@entity2 is introduced to the crowd at the 2002 @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
while many of the athletes who took to the playing fields of major league baseball this season only are focused on the game , @entity2 began saving and planning for retirement long before his career neared its end			1
" when i joined the @entity26 [ in 1982 ] , the team was transitioning , " said @entity2 , who will be inducted into the @entity24 in july			1
" i saw guys who were 34 , 35 , 36 years old -- still young guys -- about to get out of the game , and i wondered what will they do now ? " it got me thinking about what i would want to do when i got out of the game			2
most people do n't realize how fast the time goes , but i turned those questions on myself			2
" though he quickly points out that he did n't dwell on those questions , @entity2 admits it got him thinking , and eventually planning , so that when retirement came in 2001 , the shift from baseball to business was easy			1
" from the outside , i 'm sure it looked like a smooth transition just by virtue of the fact that i had another thing to go into , " he said			0
" i had prepared for what was next			0
" these days , five seasons after retiring from a 21 - year career he spent with the @entity26 , @entity2 is a businessman , team owner , radio - show host and author			1
he also will be a baseball analyst for @entity54 , which like @entity0 is owned by @entity55			2
@entity2 jumped full time into his company , @entity56 , without taking any break , lessening the emotional jolt of retirement			1
" i did n't give myself the luxury of taking a month off [ after the baseball season ] , " he said			2
" i think i would have opened myself up to regret , thinking about the past			0
i had to get a minor league baseball team in that stadium			2
i just put my head down and started working			0
" @entity2 's first post-baseball venture was developing a youth ballpark in his hometown of @entity69 , @entity70 , financed in part by a $ 75,000 gift from the @entity73			1
it was presented to him the night he broke @entity76 's record for consecutive games played			1
@entity2 was a " rookie " for the second time in his life , this time in business			1
" i was learning all over again , learning what was important , " he said			0
" the off - season never went by so fast			0
i had meetings , phone calls , plans and long days in the office			0
" by the time i looked up , [ the @entity26 ] were at spring training			0
i did n't think , ' they left without me , ' which is what i thought i would do			0
" @entity2 's latest project is a business principles book called " @entity94 : 8 elements of perseverance that make the difference , " co-authored by @entity98			1
the book , available april 10 , was born out a speech @entity2 gave about the " secrets " of his success			1
writing it turned out to be an emotional journey , he said			0
" i got to reflect on what my parents had taught me , the values and principles , right and wrong , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's good to be in touch with those things			0
" the fact is , whether in baseball or business , @entity2 rarely strays from the principles he learned from his late father , @entity116 , a former player and manager			1
the book is filled with anecdotes from on and off the field			0
now 46 , @entity2 is president and ceo of @entity56 , and his brother , @entity122 , a former teammate , is executive vice president			1
the company owns minor league teams in @entity69 and in @entity125 , @entity126			0
the brothers also have co-written two books on baseball and co-host a baseball call - in show on weekends on @entity132			1
there were reports in december that @entity2 was heading a group that was interested in buying the @entity26 , but @entity26 owner @entity136 denied that claim			1
" there is no question that @entity116 and i have a great relationship , " @entity136 told the ( @entity26 ) @entity138 " he was a great player for the @entity26 , and i have an affection for him			0
but what 's being reported , there is simply no substance to it			0
there have been no such discussions			0
" still , @entity2 said he probably would " stick his nose in " if the @entity26 became available			1
@entity2 , who has a boy and a girl , also has ventured into children 's literature , and his first book is scheduled to be released thursday			2
" the @entity161 " tells the story of the 21 - game losing streak @entity2 and his @entity26 teammates endured in 1988 and teaches the lessons of perseverance			2
@entity2 also continues his longstanding association with the @entity163 through the @entity164			2
the foundation says it has refurbished fields , donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to @entity163 throughout the country and teamed up with @entity168 to help provide baseball and softball equipment to school sports programs nationwide			2
asked what type of advice he would offer to young professional baseball players , @entity2 said , " put that [ huge contract ] aside , save your money , that 's your nest egg			1
in the off - season , think about skill development or the interests you have in a small way but be very careful			0
" you ca n't think too much about retirement as a young player			0
you have to live a narrow existence for your sport			0
