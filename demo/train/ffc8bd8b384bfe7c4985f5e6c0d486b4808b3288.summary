-- all the world is watching , eager to welcome those 33 miners from the pits of hell			2
it is a tale of courage and resilience that rivals the return of @entity9 and his men from their ill - fated voyage across @entity12			1
nearly all the credit belongs to the 33 @entity15 men who have survived the ordeal			1
so , too , should it go to their families and fellow countrymen who have heroically rushed to the rescue			2
but even as we wait to see if all men make it safely to the top , it is not too early to salute the @entity27 who pitched in to help as well with the @entity27 technology that proved so vital			1
after a long dry spell , it is so refreshing to see us at our best again			0
the @entity27 - @entity15 company @entity33 , which operated the first drill to reach the miners , assembled help and materials from across the globe			1
in @entity41 , two companies long - trained by mine collapses in that region rushed to action			0
they had @entity46 ship south a specialty drill , capable of creating shafts large enough to fit the men without collapsing , within 48 hours			0
and @entity46 did it for free			0
then , working with @entity15 crews , @entity33 's @entity52 - based partner came up with the plan to get the miners to the surface almost two months earlier than the @entity58 date originally projected			1
expert driller @entity59 , a contractor from @entity61 , @entity62 , was called from @entity63 , where he was helping @entity27 forces find water , to man the machine			1
the 40 - year - old drilled for 33 days straight , through tough mineral ore , to reach the men trapped more than 2,000 feet below			0
his comment after breaking through last week ? " we got the job done			0
" read more @entity0 op - eds three @entity74 doctors have provided advice on how to keep the miners healthy , both physically and mentally			2
and the design of the rescue pod is the brainchild of @entity74 engineer @entity80			0
@entity80 drew on his experience as a former submarine captain in the @entity83 and directed a team of 20 to conceive of a small 13 - foot - long tube to carry the miners one at a time to the surface			2
all told , about a dozen @entity27 decamped to the desert , and many more labored from home , to rescue the miners			1
the display of generosity and technological ingenuity shows our finest face to the world			1
