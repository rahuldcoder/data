in @entity2 on february 27 , 2015 , a lone gunman killed @entity3 , a former deputy prime minister and a powerful and charismatic opposition leader who stood as an alternative to @entity6			1
in @entity8 on december 1 , 1934 , a lone gunman killed @entity9 , a powerful @entity10 who stood as an alternative to @entity13			1
@entity13 's involvement in the murder was denied , and never proved			1
it goes without saying that the @entity17 also was quick to deny @entity6 's involvement in @entity3 's death			1
the parallels are worth considering			0
the murder of @entity22 marked the beginning of the great purges , the period in which high - level elites were so thoroughly " cleansed " that the @entity27 stood unprepared for @entity29 's invasion			1
similarly today , @entity6 's actions in @entity31 and his refusal to share power with a modernizing elite has condemned @entity35 to another generation of economic backwardness and political isolation			1
of course , @entity9 was n't the first political opponent to fall , any more than @entity3 was			2
rival political party leaders had been sent by @entity41 to camps in the 1920s , and opposition political movements , including in @entity31 , had struggled to defeat @entity10 collectivization in the early 1930s			1
but this was the first top - level political assassination of a person who could have become party leader			2
similarly under @entity6 , political opponents have been killed , like journalist @entity51 and @entity52 , but they did not aspire to the presidency			0
and certainly much of the @entity6 era has been absorbed with the suppression of opposition political movements , whether in @entity35 , by keeping rival party leaders from registering for elections , or abroad , by invading @entity59 , @entity60 and eastern @entity31 to prevent democratic regimes from succeeding in neighboring states			1
in the death of @entity3 , irrespective of who is ultimately found responsible , we once again have the assassination of a person who could have become the leader of the country			1
@entity13 's search for @entity22 's murderers led to a second set of crimes , the escalation of repression against the @entity76 and the show trials of the mid- 1930s			1
over a dozen of the founding members of the @entity80 were found guilty of complicity in the murder in trumped - up show trials and executed			2
the question now becomes whether @entity17 's leaders imagine that they can take the country down a similar path of isolation and ultimate destruction ? or more likely , is the @entity17 thinking at all , or just allowing the terrible logic of this system they have created to unfold ? when the @entity17 publicly labels the opposition leaders as enemies , and spews out nothing but hatred toward those who have a right to demand freedom , then killings -- irrespective of who pulled the trigger -- are a logical result			2
the @entity6 regime has succeeded over the last 15 years in establishing a regime that historically is unparalleled in its thievery			0
@entity3 himself had been the first person to start a systematic analysis of @entity6 's corruption that , he claimed , includes the building and renovation of 20 palaces , the receipt of $ 700,000 in watches , his unlimited access to yachts , planes , and a @entity17 property management department with a staff of more than 60,000 , and an annual presidential office budget of $ 2.41 billion			1
this all leaves aside the billions he is reported to have stashed abroad			0
the regime hides successfully behind @entity17 - controlled patriotism and expansionism , making its actions in @entity31 out to be a response of local @entity35 - speaking populations to @entity128 aggression in support of a fascist junta in @entity131			2
the perfidy of the regime is quite unparalleled since @entity29 hid his expansionism behind the desire to reunite german - speakers in the @entity136			0
there is however an optimistic side			0
the population in @entity35 as a whole and in the large cities of @entity2 and @entity8 in particular is not like the first - generation peasants of the @entity13 era			1
they have traveled , they know what rule - of - law systems look like , and they know what property protection feels like			0
they can ( for now ) still connect with each other on social media			0
@entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , and @entity157 are all alive with information , commiserations , and expressions of extreme anger against the @entity17			0
@entity3 had thousands of followers on social media , and many of his friends also have thousands of followers			2
other opposition leaders like @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , and many more remain , and they are both shocked and defiant			0
former prime minister @entity171 wrote on his blog : " bastards , you killed my friend in the center of @entity2 ... with four bullets , to make the point to all of us free - thinking people ...			2
the country is rolling off the cliff			0
" the march against the war in @entity185 had planned for sunday has been rescheduled as a march in his memory			0
one can only hope it will attract large numbers			0
the spokesman for the @entity192 , @entity191 , cautioned the press not to jump to conclusions and then proceeded to put up a bewildering array of possible motives that included everything except @entity17 jealousy : he called the act a political provocation perhaps perpetrated by @entity202 extremists angered over his stand on the @entity205 killing ; or a " sacral sacrifice " by the opposition itself to destabilize the country ; or related to his views on the @entity31 war ; or a business conflict ; or an assault related to his personal life			0
the fact that @entity3 's girlfriend was @entity31 and she was with him when he died was immediately picked up by @entity35 media			1
@entity6 called the assassination an apparent " contract killing " and stated he was taking charge of the investigation			0
and despite the fact that initial eyewitness reports stated that the killers were driving a white car without license plates , by noon the next day , @entity222 was claiming that the car had been found , now with license plates from the @entity202 republic of @entity230			0
the sad fact is that @entity233 powers did not understand the significance of the killing of @entity22			0
let 's hope that this time they will see @entity3 's death as the " shot that was heard around the world " and mobilize to deter further @entity35 oppression and expansionism			1
president @entity243 quickly condemned the murder and stated that " i admired @entity3 's courageous dedication to the struggle against corruption in @entity35 and appreciated his willingness to share his candid views with me when we met in @entity2 in 2009			1
" that would mean providing all forms of assistance to prevent the failure of @entity31 democracy , a dream for which @entity3 could well have died			2
how to help the @entity35 opposition depends on whether they will be able to help themselves in the weeks to come			1
no one would want to be in their shoes			0
but standing with them in their insistence -- echoing @entity3 -- that @entity6 's authoritarian regime is based on massive corruption , will be more important than ever .			1

@entity35 opposition leader @entity3 gunned down in @entity2
@entity270 asks if there 's a parallel to *famous* murder of @entity13 's rival in the 1930s
