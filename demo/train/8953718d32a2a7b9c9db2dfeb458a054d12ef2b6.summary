@entity0 -- @entity0 mayoral candidate @entity2 , who began his campaign as a long - shot but surfed a late wave of momentum by tapping into liberal anxiety over the three - term administration of mayor @entity8 , overwhelmed his opponents on tuesday to finish first in the city 's @entity11 mayoral primary			1
with results still being counted late tuesday evening , @entity2 , the city 's public advocate , was bobbing around the 40 % mark needed to avoid a three - week runoff race for the @entity11 nomination			1
early wednesday the @entity0 board of elections confirmed that there were still over 19,000 absentee ballots , special ballots , affidavits , and military ballots that needed to be counted , and that the number of uncounted votes could increase			0

down the ballot , former @entity0 gov. @entity71 's bid for political redemption was thwarted in the @entity11 race for city comptroller by @entity77 president @entity76 , who reversed @entity71 's early lead in the race by reminding voters of the prostitution scandal that derailed his political career in 2008			1
@entity36 , the city 's public advocate , frequently hammered a " tale of two cities " theme on the campaign trail , painting @entity47 's @entity0 as an increasingly unaffordable metropolis that rewarded wealthy @entity87 at the expense of the outer borough middle class			1
