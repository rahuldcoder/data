@entity0 , @entity1 -- in another major sign of growing ties between @entity1 and the @entity5 , president @entity6 on monday backed a permanent seat for @entity1 in the @entity8			1
" in the years ahead , i look forward to a reformed @entity8 that includes @entity1 as a permanent member , " he said in an address to the @entity1 parliament			1
the statement came as @entity6 made a wide - ranging address that envisioned closer economic and security ties between the @entity5 and @entity1 , standing " shoulder to shoulder " with the world 's largest democracy			1
in a swift reaction , @entity19 said it is discounting the possibility of such a development			2
the @entity23 said that " @entity1 's aspirations for recognition as a global power notwithstanding , there are reasons enough to discredit this proposed direction of the process of @entity8 reforms			1
" it cites " @entity1 's conduct in relations with its neighbors and its continued flagrant violations of @entity8 resolutions on @entity38 and @entity39 , " a disputed region that the nuclear rivals have fought about			1
@entity42 , a top @entity43 aide , told reporters before the speech that the @entity6 administration wants to " send as clear a statement as possible " that the @entity5 sees @entity1 as a " rising player " on the international stage			1
but @entity42 said the @entity5 is " not getting into " details about the time frame in which the @entity5 would like to see @entity1 get the permanent seat and whether it will push to get @entity1 veto power as well			2
@entity42 , a senior staffer on the @entity54 , said the president 's endorsement " speaks volumes " about @entity5 support for @entity1 and the administration will let the key details be " hashed out " by the @entity60 itself			1
at present , there are five permanent members -- the @entity5 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66			0
actually getting @entity1 a permanent seat will not be easy			2
@entity6 administration officials acknowledged that they and previous administrations have supported @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 at various times for permanent seats on the @entity8 without any success so far			2
before monday 's announcement was made , @entity1 prime minister @entity77 alluded to the deal during a joint news conference before @entity6 's speech to parliament in which he highlighted the close cooperation on major issues typically confronted by the @entity60			1
" as states possessing nuclear weapons , we have today put forth a common vision of a world without nuclear weapons , and decided to lead global efforts for non-proliferation and universal and non-discriminatory global nuclear disarmament , " @entity77 said			0
" this is a historic and bold bilateral initiative			0
we have also decided to strengthen cooperation to tackle nuclear terrorism , and we welcome @entity5 participation in the @entity98 , which will be set up in @entity1			2
" @entity19 , noting that reform is a " difficult process and will take significant time , " said it hopes that the @entity5 " will take a moral view and not base itself on any temporary expediency or exigencies of power politics			2
" " @entity19 believes that @entity5 endorsement of @entity1 's bid for its permanent seat in the @entity8 adds to the complexity of the process of reforms of the @entity8 , " the @entity23 's written statement said			1
" @entity19 's position on @entity8 's reforms is based on principles			1
any reform of the council that contradicts the very fundamental principles of the @entity119 -- including the principle of sovereign equality ; of equal rights and self - determination ; and the principle of collective security -- would gravely undermine the system of international relations based on the @entity119 principles			0
" @entity6 , who mourned the deaths of @entity5 citizens in the november 2008 terror attacks in @entity132 and the killings of @entity1 citizens in the september , 11 , 2001 , strikes in the @entity5 , said the shared bond is prompting both countries to work together to fight terrorism			1
he addressed the conflict in @entity139 and @entity19 in his speech			1
" @entity5 's fight against @entity142 and its terrorist affiliates is why we persevere in @entity139 , where major development assistance from @entity1 has improved the lives of the @entity139 people			1
" he said the @entity5 is working with @entity19 to address the threat of terror networks , such as those in @entity19 that were responsible for the @entity132 attacks , and it welcomes " dialogue " between the governments in @entity0 and @entity154			1
" the @entity19 government increasingly recognizes that these networks are not just a threat outside of @entity19 -- they are a threat to the @entity19 people , who have suffered greatly at the hands of violent extremists , " said @entity6			1
" and we will continue to insist to @entity19 's leaders that terrorist safe - havens within their borders are unacceptable , and that the terrorists behind the @entity132 attacks be brought to justice			1
we must also recognize that all of us have an interest in both an @entity139 and a @entity19 that is stable , prosperous and democratic -- and @entity1 has an interest in that as well			1
" @entity6 said @entity1 and the @entity5 " are now ready to begin implementing our civil nuclear agreement , " a measure he called a " landmark " deal			1
at the same time , he talked about the importance of reducing the spread of nuclear weapons			0
" the @entity5 and @entity1 can pursue our goal of securing the world 's vulnerable nuclear material			1
we can make it clear that even as every nation has the right to peaceful nuclear energy , every nation must also meet its international obligations -- and that includes the @entity186			0
" @entity6 also said monday that " the world can not remain silent " as " peaceful democratic movements are suppressed , " citing the government of @entity190 , also known as @entity190			0
" for it is unacceptable to gun down peaceful protesters and incarcerate political prisoners decade after decade			0
it is unacceptable to hold the aspirations of an entire people hostage to the greed and paranoia of a bankrupt regime			0
it is unacceptable to steal an election , as the regime in @entity190 has done again for all the world to see , " he said			0
he said @entity1 should n't avoid condemning human rights violations			0
" if i can be frank , in international fora , @entity1 has often shied away from some of these issues			0
but speaking up for those who can not do so for themselves is not interfering in the affairs of other countries			0
it 's not violating the rights of sovereign nations			0
it 's staying true to our democratic principles			0
" @entity6 hailed @entity218 , who used peaceful non-violence to help @entity1 gain its independence , and he noted @entity218 's influence on @entity222 and the non-violent resistance that typified the @entity5 civil rights movement			1
" i am mindful that i might not be standing before you today , as president of the @entity5 , had it not been for @entity218 and the message he shared and inspired with @entity5 and the world , " the president said			2
@entity6 lauded @entity1 's rise on the world stage , saying that " for @entity232 and around the world , @entity1 is not simply emerging ; @entity1 has already emerged " and he said the country is unleashing an " economic marvel			1
" he envisions , he said , @entity5 - @entity1 relations as " one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century			2
" he said @entity1 has overcome critics who say the country was too poor , vast and diverse to succeed , citing its @entity241 and investments in science and technology			0
" the world sees the results , from the supercomputers you build to the @entity1 flag that you put on the moon			0
" @entity6 praised @entity1 's democratic institutions : its free electoral system , independent judiciary , the rule of law , and free press			1
he said @entity1 and the @entity5 have a unique link because they are democracies and free - market economies			2
" when @entity1 vote , the whole world watches			0
hundreds of thousands of polling centers			0
millions of candidates and poll workers , and 700 million voters			0
there 's nothing like it on the planet			0
there is so much that countries transitioning to democracy could learn from @entity1 's experience ; so much expertise that @entity1 can share with the world			2
that , too , is what 's possible when the world 's largest democracy embraces its role as a global leader , " he said			0
noting the country 's rise as a world power , @entity6 said he sees the @entity5 cooperating with @entity1 in various international and regional alliances			1
he praised @entity1 's role in the climate change negotiations and its role as a top contributor in @entity60 peacekeeping missions			2
@entity6 talked about the two countries pursuing joint research efforts , such as starting green jobs			0
