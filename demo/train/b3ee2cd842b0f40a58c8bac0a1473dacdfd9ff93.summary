-- a top @entity2 lawmaker is demanding that the federal government help " get to the bottom " of dozens of deaths at a now defunct boys ' reform school			1
" for the sake of those who died and the family members still living , we 've got to find out what happened at the school , " @entity9 sen. @entity8 , @entity2 , said in a letter dated wednesday to @entity9 attorney general @entity11			1
his demand follows a report this week by state forensic investigators who say they 've discovered evidence that there are 19 more grave sites than previously thought at the @entity24 in the @entity2 panhandle town of @entity26			2
for years , stories and allegations of beatings , torture and murder have surrounded the century - old school			1
state authorities have previously said there were 31 burial sites at the school , and a 2009 state investigation found no allegations of wrongdoing in connection with those deaths			1
now , investigators say there 's evidence that 98 boys died at the school , and some of them may be buried in the 50 graves found on school grounds			1
the school closed last year , allegedly because of budget cuts			1
mystery surrounds school graves " the reform school may yield some ugly reminders about our past , but we absolutely must get to the bottom of this , " @entity8 said in a news release wednesday			1
@entity8 is asking the @entity58 to provide support and assistance to a team of anthropologists and forensic scientists from the @entity64 as they continue to search the school grounds			1
the @entity58 has not yet responded to @entity8 's request			1
the @entity64 team , equipped with ground - penetrating radar , is currently searching another part of the property where another cemetery may exist			2
so far , they have n't found anything			2
" we found burials within the current marked cemetery , and then we found burials that extend beyond that , " said dr. @entity74 , one of the investigating anthropologists			2
" for the majority , there 's no record of what happened to them			0
so , they may be buried here , they may have been shipped to their families			0
but we do n't know			0
" she said she hopes a more thorough investigation , which would include the exhumation of bodies , would bring some closure to the families			2
" when there 's no knowledge and no information , then people will speculate and rumors will persist or questions remain , " she said			0
@entity102 's uncle , @entity101 , died at the facility in 1935			0
he wants state authorities to carry out exhumations so he can bring his uncle 's remains home to @entity108 , @entity2			0
" this is my uncle 's body			0
we want the state of @entity2 to point us to his grave and give us access to his remains so we can have him reburied with his family , " he told @entity0			0
@entity101 said both his father and uncle were both sent to the facility at one time , and -- according to his mother -- his father saw his dead uncle being buried on the property in the middle of the night			0
@entity101 says he does not intend to sue the state of @entity2 for damages			0
he says he simply wants his uncle 's body			0
" my mission is to recover his remains and bury him next to his mother , " he said			0
who exactly is buried on the school grounds is a mystery that dates back to 1900 , when the boys ' school opened			2
the research team has gone back in time , going over old , antiquated state records and conducting interviews with survivors , when possible			0
the existing cemetery is marked only by 31 rusting tubular steel crosses			2
the forensic investigators say poorly kept , contradictory records have only added to the mystery about the cemetery and the school			2
reform school ledgers and notations label some of the boys as " runaways , " but it is unclear whether these boys were ever found			1
the school was officially closed in 2011			1
" these are children who came here and died , for one reason or another , and have just been lost in the woods , " said @entity74			0
" it 's about restoring dignity			0
" during its century - long history , 98 deaths have been documented at the school , but the whereabouts of 22 bodies can not be determined by examining historical records , according to @entity74			1
her team 's findings only add to the mystery , controversy and horror that has surrounded the former reform school for years			1
elderly men , who were once sent to the reform school as wayward youth , have come forward with horrific tales of beatings , abuse and stories of boys who simply disappeared			1
in 2008 , @entity2 's then - gov. @entity181 ordered a state investigation into allegations by a group of men , known as " the @entity24 , " who had came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators in the 1960s			1
the @entity191 issued a report that found 31 boys were buried in the cemetery , although each individual plot could not be identified			1
that report found that most of the boys had died either in a 1914 fire or from a flu pandemic four years later			0
at the time , the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried , blaming poorly kept school records			1
@entity191 closed the case due to the lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct , and no charges were filed			2
the new findings will undoubtedly lead to speculation that the newly discovered graves are evidence of a generations - long criminal coverup by administrators of the prison			1
in a statement to @entity0 , @entity191 said it is aware of the new report			0
" in the absence of any additional evidence , we do not anticipate further criminal investigative action , " said @entity225 , an @entity191 communications coordinator .			0
