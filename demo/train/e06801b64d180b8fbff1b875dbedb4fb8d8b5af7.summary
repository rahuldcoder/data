@entity0 , @entity1 -- soccer fans have never been shy about expressing their opinions , but this year 's @entity5 in @entity6 -- which will be the first of the " social media age " according to many -- may see record levels of global interactivity			1
sites such as @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 were in their infancy in 2006 , when the last @entity5 took place in @entity18 , but have since exploded in popularity			1
social media now connects millions around the world -- 50 million tweets are sent daily while @entity13 boasts more than 400 million active users -- a development that will allow fans separated by distance to celebrate goals or critique referee decisions together online			1
" football is the world 's biggest sport , so the world will practically stop for the month of the @entity5 , " @entity29 , head of new media for world soccer 's governing body @entity31 , told @entity2			1
" there will be so much more media consumed , used and published in 2010 than in 2006			0
social media can bring fans closer together and give fans more opportunity to communicate with each other , " he added			0
@entity31 has its own social - networking service on @entity31 -- called " @entity46 " -- which has 1.6 million members , but the organization is about to make a bigger push into social media			1
@entity29 said that @entity51 , which allows web sites to be shared on @entity13 , will be incorporated into @entity31 and that @entity31 plans to launch official @entity14 accounts for the @entity5 too			1
@entity29 would not give specifics but he said the accounts may include tweets from people in the " top echelons " of @entity31			1
could that mean tweets from @entity31 president @entity59 himself ? @entity29 would n't say , but he promised some " exciting announcements in may			2
" regardless of who does the tweeting for @entity31 , expect to see a lot of tweets flying back and forth between fans when the action starts on june 11			2
the match between the @entity69 and @entity70 on the tournament 's second day should be particularly fun to monitor on @entity14			0
" our notion is that [ the @entity5 ] will eclipse everything we have seen so far [ on @entity14 ] including the @entity69 election , the @entity78 or the @entity79 , simply because it is so international , " @entity72 , a @entity14 employee that works on media partnerships , told @entity2			1
@entity72 suspects that during the month - long tournament , terms related to the @entity5 will rank highly among the service 's " @entity82 , " a measure of the most popular discussions on @entity14			1
and during the last few days of the tournament , he expects @entity5 discussion to " absolutely take over @entity14			2
" so far , many fans have been using the @entity14 hash tag # @entity89 when they tweet about the @entity5			2
although @entity14 is based in the @entity69 , where soccer is not as popular in other parts of the world , the service is seeing its fastest growth outside of @entity69 , @entity72 said			0
the service is now available in six languages , there are plans to add more , and a recent report found that only half of all tweets are in @entity103			0
@entity14 is also striking deals with mobile providers in other countries so that it is free for subscribers to send and receive tweets on their phones			0
@entity72 said this is particularly important in countries such as @entity6 , where access to computers and smart phones is limited			0
and it wo n't be just fans tweeting about the @entity5			2
several top players including @entity120 star @entity119 and @entity121 of the @entity69 are active on @entity14			0
@entity29 said @entity31 has issued guidelines that players should not tweet from inside the @entity5 stadiums , and it is up to individual nations to impose further restrictions			1
already , @entity70 coach @entity127 has reportedly banned his players from posting to @entity14 or @entity13 during the @entity5			2
when there is a great goal , or a controversial penalty , fans will likely turn to video sharing site @entity15 to watch the watch plays , create parody or " mashup " videos and record their own reactions			2
" things like the @entity5 really excite us because we see a level of engagement and interaction beyond what we normally see , " @entity15 's sports manager @entity139 told @entity2			1
" within minutes of the @entity5 starting , we will certainly see thousands and thousands of uploads about the @entity5			1
" in 2006 , after @entity152 player @entity151 head - butted @entity153 of @entity154 , hundreds of videos parodying the play were posted on @entity15			1
some videos placed @entity151 in a video game while others showed him in well - known movie scenes			0
@entity15 's popularity has surged since 2006 thanks in part to the advent of inexpensive video cameras and cell phones that can record and instantly upload video to the @entity166			0
@entity139 predicts there will be more mashups and parodies during the @entity5 as well as videos examining the political implications of an @entity173 nation hosting the tournament for the first time			0
he also says there will be lots of videos where fans put the camera on top of their television and record themselves reacting to a goal or red card decision , a relatively new phenomenon			0
" we will see no limit to the uses and creativity that emerge around the @entity5 , " @entity139 said			0
be sure to follow @ @entity189 on @entity14 for all the latest @entity5 news and information .			0
