@entity0 -- you may drive a hybrid car , eat organic food , use " green " beauty products and design your home according to the latest environmentally friendly standards			1
but if you have n't considered " greening your love life , you are still a total environmental disaster , " according to @entity9 , author of the recently released book , " @entity11			1
" how should it work ? should you envision melting glaciers during a romantic dinner with your significant other ? well , not quite			2
it could be as simple as where you choose to go on a date			2
" how about going to a restaurant where you can eat a seductive menu based on organic , local food , which has produced less carbon dioxide before it ends up on your plate ? " @entity9 suggested			1
she is hoping to steer people away from " dirty " sex toward eco-sex			2
that means : hop on your bike for your next date and leave your car at home			1
( that means saying " adieu " to long - distance relationships			0
) stop excessive spending on @entity39			0
( it produces way too much trash anyway			0
) wear comfy bamboo underwear			0
do n't be so keen on having babies			0
how about adopting a child instead or implementing a one - child policy ? @entity9 ' theory is not entirely new			1
@entity47 published a guide to " environmentally friendly sex " in 2002 , which includes " switching off the lights during romance " or " if you want to see your partner , have sex during the day			0
" but @entity9 goes further : she covers everything from your first date to raising your kids " green			1
" she also suggests keeping the environment in mind when your sex drive is fading			2
@entity62 , she says , is overrated			1
" people should eat oysters as an aphrodisiac instead , " @entity9 says			1
" they are a full of zinc , a precursor of testosterone			0
@entity69 himself was known to eat them in great quantities before sex			2
" on the streets of @entity0 , the idea of an eco-friendly love life is met with laughter			1
" how green is my love life ? are you serious ? do n't be absurd ! " were the most common reactions from people on the street			1
but the concept is in full display at a local sex shop			0
" we sell organic oils , edible underwear and toys that are completely recyclable , " says @entity87 , a salesman at @entity89 's " @entity88			0
" " the problem is our customers are embarrassed to dispose their toys properly			0
" he says he thinks promoting an eco-friendly sex life could be " big business			2
" " we should have an extra shelf for our green - conscious customers , " @entity87 suggests			1
his colleague , @entity102 , is less enthusiastic about the idea			0
" i try to live environmentally friendly , but it goes way over the top to think about [ carbon dioxide reduction ] in my love life , " she says			1
" i never thought about how green my love life is			1
but in fact this is about reducing our extensive consumption and that should concern every part of our life , " he says			2
@entity108 , who is the director of @entity117 in @entity0 , decided long ago to have only one child			0
" but i am glad the book does n't prohibit making love outdoors , " @entity108 joked			2
" that produces zero carbon dioxide			0
" it 's clear in @entity9 ' 200 - page book that she is using sex to promote a completely green lifestyle			1
but is that such a bad thing ? " with sex anything sells			0
even the environment , " @entity9 says			1
she says she is hoping that , in the midst of the global climate crisis debate , her book " may finally approach those green - grumps , who do n't know the basics about living an environmentally friendly life			1
" that does n't seem likely after reading conservative blogger @entity139 's post on her book : " i actually hope the climate alarmists , consisting of mostly liberals , take her advice on how to have eco-friendly sex without getting pregnant , " @entity139 posted on @entity140			0
" the world could use a whole lot less unhinged liberals taught by their unhinged liberal parents			0
" @entity149 , who teaches psychology at @entity151 , sees a different problem with the eco-sex theory			0
thinking about the environmental impact of your love life , he says , goes against human nature			1
" human beings are irrational , " he says			0
" we make decisions based on our desire , especially when it comes to love			2
