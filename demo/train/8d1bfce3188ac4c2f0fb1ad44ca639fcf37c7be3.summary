@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 fans all around the world will be eagerly scouring for transfer news and gossip over the possible arrival of new players during the close season			1
@entity4 striker @entity11 sports the club 's new kit for the forthcoming season but just as important to many supporters over the break will be being among the first to get their hands on the club 's new kit			1
the @entity21 champions have just launched a new home kit for the forthcoming season which pays homage to their 100th year playing at their @entity26 stadium			2
@entity4 's new shirt features a large chevron across the chest , which echoes the same pattern @entity4 wore on their shirts during the 1909/10 season when @entity26 first opened			1
what do you think of the new kits launched by @entity4 and @entity37 ? how do they compare to other shirts ? add your comments to the ' sound off ' box below			1
@entity43 defender @entity42 revealed the players are just as excited as the fans when it comes to wearing the latest club uniform			0
he said : " you feel very proud every time you put the @entity4 kit on			1
when i first signed that was the thing i was most looking forward to -- putting it on and seeing how it felt			0
i was like an excited kid ! i 'm sure we 'll all be buzzing when we run out in the new kits next season			2
" @entity58 hopes the chevron design will help inspire the players to reach new heights in the forthcoming season and added : " i like to think of it as ' v ' for victory and hopefully we can win every game we play in the new kits ! " see our photo gallery of the good , the bad , and the ugly of football shirts throughout the years			1
» although @entity4 fans are not quite as lucky as @entity42 and @entity70 and will have to wait until july 16 before they will be able to proudly show their colors			1
@entity72 winners @entity37 also have a smart new home kit which features a gladiator - style breast plate design and draws inspiration from looks that have graced the @entity78 over the years , especially seen in the ergonomically fitted shape and crew collar			1
the new shirt , which is on sale now , certainly meets the approval of @entity37 winger @entity84 who told the club 's web site : " the new kit is nice , so now let 's see what happens in it during the new season			1
" of course , football kits are not just a way of visually separating two teams on a playing field ; they are increasingly an important part of a club 's commercial operations			2
the world - record transfer of @entity101 to @entity102 could be worth up to $ 75m a season in revenue to the @entity106 giants , according to research commissioned by @entity108 with one of the world 's leading sport business experts			2
speaking on behalf of @entity108 , professor @entity112 , director of the centre for the @entity113 ( @entity114 ) at @entity115 , suggests that with @entity116 already moving to the @entity117 , @entity102 could benefit from $ 175m a year in additional revenue generated by the two stars			2
he said : " @entity101 can be viewed in the same bracket as @entity122 when it comes to global commercial impact , if their image is controlled right and @entity102 improve their results in the @entity128 as a result of their arrival			0
" @entity122 sold a million shirts in his first six months at @entity102 when he was just one of several ' galacticos ' turning out for the all - whites , alongside the likes of @entity135 , @entity136 and the @entity138 ronaldo			0
" even if @entity102 signed one or two of the other stars , there would be a real focus on @entity101 's and @entity116 talents on the pitch , but also their brand off it			0
that will pay for their transfers several times over , even with a bumper salary package			0
" @entity149 , partner in the sport business group at accountancy firm @entity151 , told @entity2 that shirt revenues were not massive , but they were still important in taking the club 's brand around the globe			0
@entity149 said shirt sales are dominated by the biggest clubs and figures would " closely mirror " the top of the " @entity160 " rich - list which would @entity102 and @entity4 as the two biggest shirt - sellers worldwide			1
the outlook for sales for the forthcoming season might not be as profitable as previous years though as the global economic situations impacts on the spending power of the average fan			0
the " @entity176 " released earlier this year by @entity177 has showed large increases in the cost of an average game day for fans which could result in a drop in kit sales			0
@entity178 , chairman of the @entity179 in @entity0 , added : " it will not be surprising if sales of replica shirts suffer as a result of the recession			0
the bottom line for fans is that you need a ticket to get into the game but you do n't need a replica shirt , and when money 's tight , it 's the non-essentials which will go			0

@entity4 and @entity37 reveal kits for the forthcoming campaign
the sale of shirts can be a big source of revenue for many football clubs
some shirts have been good , others bad and some *downright* ugly
