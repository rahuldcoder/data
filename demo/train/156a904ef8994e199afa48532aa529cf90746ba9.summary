-- with less than 48 hours to go before our fit nation team tackles its first triathlon in @entity4 , @entity5 , we asked them to reflect on the past nine months of training			1
here are the top five lessons they learned : like riding a bike , sometimes in life you just have to let go			1
learning to ride the bike was the toughest challenge i had on this journey			1
every ride i had until the midway trip in @entity19 was full of fear and white knuckles			1
i could n't make myself lay off the brakes coming down hills , so it made it very hard to climb back up			1
but on the midway trip , coach april got inside my head and heart			1
during a bike ride , she said , " i want you to know you deserve this -- all the time and work you 've put into this			1
it 's worth it ; all you have to do is let go and take it			1
" like braking on a bike , i was holding on too tightly to people , words and situations that had hurt me and to worries about things i have absolutely no control over			1
so write down everything you are holding on to that is preventing you from living the life you deserve			1
you are n't writing them down to dwell on them ; you are writing them down to get them out of your heart and off your mind			1
here 's mine : " i am not defined by the scars of my past			2
it is up to me to define who i am now and who i will become			2
the only person i can save is myself			2
when i find it difficult to accept what i have no control over , i will let go and trust in @entity67 to guide me			2
" -- @entity68 giving up is not an option			1
life is never going to stop			2
the ups and downs of being a human being on @entity67 's green @entity74 are going to continue whether we like it or not			2
both honeymoons and valleys are undoubtedly going to greet you along the way			2
do n't get me wrong ; being on the @entity82 team has been an awesome experience			2
but it has also proved to be much harder than i ever expected			2
i 've fallen so many times , and in so many ways , yet i 'm not giving up on my goal of crossing the finish line in @entity4			1
whether it 's mental or physical , remind yourself that giving up is not an option			2
getting to the finish line , regardless of your race , may not be pretty or perfect , but i promise that you 'll get there			1
just keep picking yourself up when you fall			2
-- @entity97 you ca n't go wrong following your passion			1
little did i know how triathlon training would permeate my life			1
i did n't notice it at first ; i was too preoccupied with anxiety and fear about the journey upon which i was embarking			2
still mired in self - doubt and comparing myself to those around me , i was worried that i would n't be enough			0
but little by little , my attitude shifted			0
physical feats i did n't think possible became daily routines			0
incrementally , my body and my mind became stronger			0
i became comfortable in my imperfect body , realizing its value lies not in how others view it or the clothes i use to dress it but rather in the places it can take me			0
others noticed this change too			0
friends , family and co-workers remarked that i looked good , looked healthy , looked happy			0
and i was all of those things and more			0
i imagine the same happens when an artist picks up a paintbrush , a dancer learns her first moves or a writer finishes a manuscript			0
the pleasure in following your heart and working hard to achieve a goal you see so vividly is infectious			0
whether it 's sport , art , music or any number of things , you ca n't go wrong with following your passion			0
you 'll soon find your inner joy burning so brightly that others will be drawn to your light			0
-- @entity148 keep moving forward			1
during the first few weeks , i was completely overwhelmed -- from making time to work out to improving my diet to learning how to operate the new electronic devices we used to track our mileage			1
so many times , i wondered if i was in over my head and if i really had what it was going to take to do a triathlon in nine short months			1
luckily , all i had to do was look at my right wrist , where a silver band with the words " keep moving forward " reminded me that i did n't need to conquer everything at once ; i just needed to take one small step in the right direction in order to keep moving toward my goal			0
it is hard for me to put into words how much strength and determination this simple mantra provides me with each and every day			0
as i have dealt with tragedies , emergencies and the everyday ups and downs of life , it reminded me that a simple step , no matter how small forward , meant i was moving in the right direction			0
this time next week , the event that i have trained for and looked forward to since january will be a memory			0
my fears and anxiety have been replaced with pride and excitement			0
i know that for the rest of my life , i will continue to keep moving forward , one step at a time			0
-- @entity189 invite others into your world the reason i am here , feeling well - prepared to start and finish in @entity4 , is because of the incredible support i 've gotten from my teammates , my family , my friends and even strangers who have followed my progress			1
if i had attempted this triathlon thing on my own , i 'm not sure that i would have made it			1
in fact , i know i would have stopped swimming out of pure frustration			0
but the encouragement and advice that everyone has given to me has carried me through to this point			0
we think of triathlon as an individual pursuit , and we do run the races alone			1
but we did n't get to those races alone			0
we got there as a team			0
my team has carried me through , and i 'm proud to say that because of all of you , i am ready to be a triathlete			0
my most import lesson i 've learned is to invite people into your world , allow them to become part of your journey and accept their shoulder for support when you need it			1
they 'll help you achieve your goals			0
