@entity0 , @entity1 -- as presidents @entity3 and @entity4 parry over troop levels and assistance , " retrograde " is the operant word i am hearing from @entity10 commanders in @entity1			1
a nuanced military term for withdrawal , retrograde defines operations in this insurgency - plagued land			2
after more than a decade of @entity10 - led warfare , @entity10 commanders are now insisting their @entity1 counterparts take over the fight			1
the @entity21 's @entity20 is the battle - space owner of eastern @entity1 's restive @entity24 and @entity25 provinces , both of which border @entity28 's anarchic tribal regions			1
in the brigade headquarters at @entity0 -- a building hardened against rocket and mortar attack -- @entity33 deputy commander col. @entity32 told me , " our mission was to go from a partnered role with the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) to an advise and assist role			0
we kind of gave it the ' tough love ' approach			0
" with the announced @entity10 withdrawal in 2014 , @entity10 officers have no choice but to push the @entity1 security forces forward			1
what does the future hold for @entity1 ? it 's a big change for @entity1 commanders used to @entity10 troops taking the lead and accustomed to having the formidable @entity10 firepower and air support			1
@entity32 talked of turning down a cosseted @entity1 commander who demanded helicopter transport to one of his bases			1
" we fly them nowhere , " @entity32 told me			0
" it 's a big transition			0
it 's a clash of wills			0
" @entity32 is the right man for the job			0
a hulking , gravel - voiced @entity70 from an @entity72 family of seven boys , @entity32 is a @entity75 graduate who has served in @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity1			1
@entity32 and other @entity10 officers in @entity1 talk about the need to transition to " @entity81 " " a sustainable @entity1 security force that does it the @entity1 way			1
the @entity10 partnering strategy of " @entity85 " ( @entity86 ) has abruptly given way to " after you " as @entity1 security forces take the lead -- sometimes reluctantly			1
" across the a / o ( area of operations ) , i would n't paint a rosy picture , " @entity32 says			0
" we 've had some very good success			0
we 've had some moderate success			0
we have not encountered any nightmares			0
" across the insurgent heartland of eastern and southern @entity1 , there 's a palletizing fever as @entity10 equipment is packed for shipment			1
in military briefings , @entity10 bases scheduled for imminent closure are highlighted on @entity106 maps			1
long convoys of armored vehicles are making their way back from forward bases as combat outposts are closed or transferred to @entity1 security forces			1
remaining @entity10 bases are groaning with the influx of transiting troops and contractors , housed in new barrios of @entity119 tents and " tin - can " metal housing pods			1
turning off the lights in @entity1 some bases are being dismantled and returned to nature			2
@entity124 , named after @entity126 star and @entity128 soldier @entity127 who died in an infamous friendly fire incident , was one of those closed			0
" we scraped it clean , " @entity32 said			0
@entity10 anti-ied teams traveled north to blow up the watchtowers			2
the base is now a soccer field , where @entity1 boys play a wolfish style of football			2
as @entity3 administration representatives float the big round trial balloon of zero troops in @entity1 , soldiers here talk about the spring 2013 drawdown of 20 % of the remaining 66,000 @entity10 troops , with another 50 % to be gone soon after			1
how are the @entity1 responding to @entity10 retrograde ? among some , there is clearly denial			1
they simply ca n't imagine a country rich enough , or foolish enough , to just walk away from the enormous investment poured into these bases , many just built during the boom that accompanied @entity3 's troop surge			2
aid and development money is drying up			0
i listened to one @entity1 government farm worker in insecure @entity163 insist that a @entity10 military development team needed to build a fence around a section of a @entity10 - financed @entity1 demonstration farm			1
the @entity10 commander patiently told the farmer he should ask his provincial agriculture minister to do it			2
" we do n't do projects anymore , " the commander repeatedly said			0
the farmer , who sported a bright gold wristwatch that signifies inordinate wealth ( and sometimes indicates @entity178 ties ) , retorted that the ministry was " weak , " so the @entity10 " friends " needed to do it			2
many @entity1 tell me they are very pessimistic about post- 2014 security			2
one @entity1 who has translated for @entity10 forces in @entity24 for nine years says , " the @entity1 situation right now is kind of bad			1
if the @entity10 forces withdraw from @entity1 , i do n't think the @entity1 army is strong enough to defend everybody			1
" @entity4 , in his own words , on @entity10 troops he told me he hoped coalition forces would keep training the @entity1 security forces			1
" right now if the coalition forces would leave , it 's going to be so hard for the @entity1 people			2
" like many of his colleagues , the educated interpreter , whose father was an @entity201 general , is applying for a special @entity10 immigration visa			2
other afghans are getting angry			0
one @entity10 commander in southern @entity1 told me about his @entity1 counterpart flaring up when he learned @entity10 support was being quickly scaled back			1
it 's a dictum that " retrograde under contact " ( withdrawal under pressure ) is among the most difficult of military operations			0
at some point when troop levels have dropped , all a force can do is protect itself			0
as @entity10 forces withdraw after well over a decade of war , the insurgents have responded in various ways			2
ieds continue to be the weapon of choice			0
media - magnet complex attacks , such as the spectacular attacks on @entity224 and @entity225 when @entity227 's prince @entity226 was stationed there , broadcast the insurgency is still thriving			0
in some formerly insecure provinces such as @entity24 , insurgent attacks have diminished			0
i asked @entity32 about the contention that attacks dropped because casualty - cautious @entity10 commanders ordered fewer combat patrols			2
@entity32 challenged the idea that @entity10 soldiers are not " out there , " saying soldiers constantly travel the roads on retrograde convoys			1
" we 're not finding the mother lodes of caches ( insurgent military supplies ) when we go out , " he says			0
" we 're not getting a fight			0
" then i asked about the assessment that @entity1 insurgents are just husbanding their forces while the @entity10 withdraws			1
" husbanding of forces , " @entity32 quickly agrees			0
" i might buy that			0
" opinion : @entity10 needs significant military presence in @entity1			1

front - line @entity10 soldiers stepping back , forcing @entity1 to step up
@entity256 : " shoulder - to - shoulder " **policy** with @entity1 troops is now an " after you " **policy**
some @entity1 do n't believe that @entity10 will leave or that @entity1 are ready to take their place
but @entity10 troops are already dismantling some bases
