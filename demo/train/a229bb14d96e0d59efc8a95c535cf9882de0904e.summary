the colorful @entity0 , who died in unexplained circumstances over the weekend at a country estate south of @entity3 , was one of the @entity5 oligarchs who made fortunes following the breakup of the former @entity8			1
but by the time of his death the 67 - year - old was reportedly in financial difficulties after he was ordered to pay a massive divorce settlement to his ex-wife as well as legal costs following the loss of a $ 6.5 billion lawsuit against fellow oligarch @entity18 last year			1
his high - stakes later years were a far cry from his earlier career as a @entity23 math professor and systems analyst who switched to more lucrative jobs in @entity26 , said @entity28 's @entity27 , who interviewed him many times			1
@entity0 went on to sell cars " at a time when that was a luxury , " she said			2
" there were a lot of people who wanted to buy them , and he parlayed that -- as so many of these oligarchs did -- into something much , much bigger			0
" while @entity0 made a good portion of his money from luxury car sales , his wealth and political influence skyrocketed when he bought into @entity5 media			1
he invested in the @entity46 , which -- with @entity47 as a partner -- founded @entity23 's first independent television station , tv - 6			0
under president @entity55 , the @entity5 's first president from 1991 to 1999 , " there were really no rules governing anything , " @entity27 said			0
businessmen who came to be known as oligarchs amassed massive wealth and political influence in the 1990s during the privatization of @entity5 following the fall of the @entity8			0
those like @entity0 wound up lending the fledgling @entity5 government money " when it was desperate for money , " @entity27 said			2
" these guys picked up companies on the cheap -- for pennies on the dollar			0
" a year or two later , the companies were worth much more , and the owners became wealthy			0
in return for backing @entity55 , @entity0 gained political influence within the @entity74			1
he later backed @entity75 for president , pouring money into the latter 's political party			1
but after he was elected , @entity75 saw that the oligarchs had the potential to gain too much political power and moved to thwart them , @entity27 said			2
it has been widely reported that @entity75 resented the meddling of the oligarchs , particularly @entity0			1
@entity0 did not have an easy time of it as an oligarch			2
" there were two attempts on his life , " said @entity89 , a former @entity90 executive vice president and a former consultant to @entity0			1
" one at his country home outside @entity23 in a gated community			0
somebody planted a bomb in his car and , fortunately , it did n't work very well			0
and the other was when he was leaving his club and there was a car bomb in the car and his driver was killed and he escaped without injury			0
" within months of @entity75 's election in 2000 , the government began trying to collect on tax claims against the oligarchs , including @entity0 , who fled to @entity113			1
@entity0 began agitating from @entity113 against @entity75 , calling for a coup to oust the @entity5 president			1
in 2003 , as @entity5 was seeking his return , @entity0 was granted political asylum by @entity113 authorities after they realized he was wanted on political grounds , not criminal , according to published reports at the time			1
the case strained relations between @entity23 and @entity3			0
@entity0 was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in absentia by a @entity5 court in 2007			2
he also accused @entity5 of trying to assassinate him , and eventually befriended @entity128 , the @entity129 ( the @entity132 's successor ) agent who claimed to have been sent to kill him			0
@entity128 himself died at a @entity3 hospital november 23 , 2006 , from a massive dose of the radioactive material polonium - 210			0
in a deathbed statement he blamed @entity75 for his death , something the @entity74 strongly denied			1
@entity0 later won libel damages in @entity3 over allegations that he was involved in @entity128 's death , which were broadcast april 1 , 2007 , on @entity146 's news program @entity144 , or @entity147			2
but he is believed to have been in serious financial difficulties after running up huge legal fees in recent years			0
in 2011 he paid out what was reported to have been @entity113 's biggest - ever divorce settlement to ex-wife @entity152			1
the @entity153 said the settlement was worth up to Â£ 220 million ( $ 330 million )			0
and @entity0 made headlines the following year after losing what was called one of the most expensive private lawsuits in history against @entity18 , a former friend and ally			1
@entity0 sued @entity18 , owner of @entity161 , for $ 5.1 billion , alleging that he was forced to sell his stake in the @entity5 oil company @entity163 for a fraction of its true value			1
the judge called @entity0 's testimony unreliable and , at points , dishonest			1
analysts put the price tag for legal fees alone at more than $ 250 million spent between the two sides , which @entity0 was ordered to pay			2
@entity0 was this year reported to be in serious financial difficulties ; last week he sold an @entity176 screen print entitled " @entity177 " for $ 200,000 and the mansion where he died was reported to be owned by his ex-wife			0
as speculation swirled about the cause of his death , @entity180 , a friend of @entity0 , said sunday that his friend was unhappy and was in financial trouble , but would n't have harmed himself			0
@entity0 , he said , had always hoped to return to @entity5 someday			0
about two months ago , he sent a letter to @entity75 asking permission to return to @entity5 , @entity75 spokesman @entity186 said			0
" he admitted that he had made a lot of mistakes , asked forgiveness for the mistakes and asked @entity75 to let him return home , " @entity186 said , according to a duty officer with the presidential press service			2
it 's unknown whether @entity75 responded to the letter , but @entity0 did not return .			1
