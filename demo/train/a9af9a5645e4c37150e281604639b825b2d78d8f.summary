-- it 's the most controversial issue since people started filming videos in portrait mode			2
should tablets be used as cameras ? whipping out a tablet to take a photo is a practice that , like it or not , is going mainstream			2
once primarily the domain of dads who do n't mind embarrassing their children , tablet photography has become so common that @entity15 added serious camera features to its new full - sized @entity17			1
why , when it 's very likely they have a smartphone with a better camera , do people use tablets to take photos and videos ? " i think people look a little silly doing it but i can understand why , " said @entity28 , founder of @entity29			1
" it 's like the world 's biggest viewfinder			2
" traditional cameras have small viewfinders that , when you put your eye to them , fill your entire view with a scene			0
smartphone screens are dinky in comparison			0
someone who struggles to see a phone screen , especially when holding the device in outstretched arms , may enjoy the extra real estate of a tablet			2
@entity49 is also much easier on a tablet			2
on a smartphone , post-production is usually limited to a few tweaks and an @entity55 filter , but a tablet is large enough to be a decent canvas for editing			2
@entity28 's site is a popular shop for mobile photography accessories			1
since the @entity17 debuted , he has seen a jump in the number of people buying tablet - specific photography tools , like the @entity67			1
for critics , a better view is n't enough to justify pulling out a tablet instead of a phone or real camera			2
aside from the camera quality , there are a number of reasons for the stigma against tablet photography -- including what professional photographer and instructor @entity79 calls " the dorky factor			1
" wielding a large flat rectangle to take a photo is awkward			0
the thin smooth frame is made for gripping with two hands or resting on a surface , not holding it above your head while you tap to focus a shot			0
light bouncing off the large glossy screen can create unfortunate glare , especially outdoors			0
the shape and size can also have an impact on a final photo			0
cameras have an effect on their subjects			0
a person will act differently in front of a large professional dlsr setup versus a smartphone or tablet			0
" as a street photographer where keeping a low profile is hugely helpful to capture real moments , using a large tablet is the opposite of ' stealthy , ' " said @entity79 , who teaches a course on street photography			1
" i find the tablet photographer looks a bit invasive and aggressive holding that big device in front of whatever or whoever they aim it at			0
" it 's not just the person they 're photographing that might be put off			0
events like concerts are already turning into obnoxious seas of smartphones being held in the air			0
the only thing worse is the person who holds up a tablet , blocking other peoples ' views			0
early tablet photographers clearly are n't too concerned about what other people think , or the hardware 's limitations			1
@entity15 's upgrades mean the practice could catch on with more people and shed some negative associations			1
remember , there was resistance to smartphone photography at first , too , but it took off because people always had the devices in their pockets and sharing was instant			0
the photos were n't great quality but using a phone was convenient , and " the best camera is the one that 's with you " became a rallying cry			1
the @entity158 's main camera is now competitive with the @entity159			0
it has an eight megapixel sensor and a number of camera features previously only found on @entity164 , including time - lapse video , slow - motion and burst mode			0
@entity15 says its new @entity169 screen has been redesigned and given an anti-reflective coating to reduce glare by more than half			1
inside , there 's a more powerful graphics processor , which makes the tablet a great tool for editing			1
the number of full - featured photo and video editing apps for the @entity17 is growing : @entity15 demonstrated the new @entity182 app at its press event , using it to remove an unwanted oryx from a desert scene			1
there are still many valid reasons for not using a tablet as a camera , but the upgraded @entity17 camera chips away at some of them			1
the increased range in sizes for mobile devices is also helping blur the lines between phones and tablets			0
" there 's going to be less stigma because everyone 's toting around these bigger phones , " said @entity28			1
" it 's going to become a little easier to justify pulling out the @entity17			1

some say it 's dorky to take photos with a tablet
@entity15 adds features to improve @entity17 photography
bigger smartphones may ease stigma of tablet photography
