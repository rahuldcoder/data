@entity0 -- in just a few days , a politician largely unknown outside the @entity3 has earned the dubious reputation on the world stage as the " rape - gaffe congressman			0
" it 's not an enviable title but one that has inspired column - writers worldwide to pick apart @entity11 's comments -- their possible implications for the @entity3 presidential election and what they say about an apparently civilized society 's attitude towards rape			1
the standard news story has been syndicated worldwide , stating the bare facts ; that a @entity21 congressman referred to " legitimate rape " when trying to explain , incorrectly , a woman 's biological response to being raped			1
rape victims , the congressmen inferred , would not become pregnant because " the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down			0
" the comment came in response to a presenter 's question as to whether abortion should be allowed in the case of rape			2
@entity11 defies mounting calls to withdraw from @entity39 race @entity11 's comments echoed as far away as the @entity42 , where award - winning playwright @entity43 penned a powerful open letter titled , " dear mr. @entity11 , i want you to imagine ... " the @entity3 author of " @entity46 " wrote that she was lying awake at 2 a.m. in @entity47 in the @entity48 in the @entity42 where she was working to support " thousands of women who have been raped and violated and tortured from this ceaseless war for minerals fought on their bodies			1
" " mr. @entity11 , your words have kept me awake , " she wrote , before explaining what it means for women who have been raped to hear him make the distinction between " legitimate " and " illegitimate " rape			1
" the underlying assumption of your statement is that women and their experiences are not to be trusted			0
that their understanding of rape must be qualified by some higher , wiser authority , " she wrote , before imploring him to imagine someone " violently , hatefully forcing themself into you so that you are ripped apart			0
" at the time of writing the story had been shared more than 60,000 times on @entity75			0
" everyone 's talking about rape , " declared @entity76 , writing in @entity79 's @entity78 newspaper			1
" it is testament to the determination of some folk to bend reality to their preferred viewpoint that there are so many intriguing words around these days for rape to make it seem , i do n't know , less rapey , " she wrote , looping a string around @entity11 and " certain devotees of @entity96			2
" @entity11 's remarks deemed ' harmful ' to rape survivors she was referring to @entity100 , a @entity79 lawmaker with the @entity101 , perhaps best known outside the @entity79 for his fiery testimony at a 2005 @entity3 @entity104 hearing into alleged impropriety concerning the @entity107 ' oil - for - food scheme			1
@entity100 has refused to retract comments made in his video podcast in which he said the allegations made by two women in @entity114 against @entity116 founder @entity96 " did not constitute rape " but were more of a case of " bad sexual etiquette			1
" however , the majority of international column space devoted to the @entity11 comments related to their impact on the @entity3 presidential race			2
historian @entity125 struck back with this blunt analysis in @entity79 's @entity128 newspaper			2
" @entity11 's remarks on rape do n't tell you what conservatives think about sexual assault			1
they do n't tell you much about anything , other than that @entity11 is an idiot			2
" he added that @entity11 's comments were what president @entity139 had been waiting for ; an opportunity to swing the political narrative from jobs to culture			1
opinion : rape can make you pregnant			0
" how @entity11 's foolishness will play out in the election remains to be seen			1
incredibly , he remains neck - and - neck in his @entity21 race , which suggests that economics continues to eclipse social policy in the popular mind , " he wrote			0
but the @entity158 @entity157 's @entity3 correspondent @entity156 said @entity11 's comments had " trashed " any hopes that @entity160 had of " refocusing attention on to economics			1
" the straight news story about @entity11 's comments and refusal to end his bid for the @entity39 was carried on several websites in @entity168 , and generated a sprinkling of discussion on the country 's twitter - like micro-blogs			1
user " @entity173 " wrote : " is he an undercover sent by the @entity175 to destroy the opponent ? @entity139 must be so happy to see this			0
" and " reddress " said : " this would be a big headache for the @entity181			0
a lousy teammate who can sabotage his own people is the worst			0
" under a column entitled " mistake of words and of the heart , " the @entity186 's @entity185 editor @entity184 asked why a @entity3 politician was peddling pregnancy rape theories which dated back to the 13th century			2
" mr @entity11 may have many admirable qualities which recommend him to the voters of @entity21 , but it seems strange that a 21st century politician is willing to legislate on the grounds of old wives ' tales			2
perhaps he should be explaining that , rather than his clumsy use of language , " he wrote			0
one @entity1 reader who commented on the opinion piece " @entity204 : it 's not just @entity11 " also looked beyond @entity11 's wording to question the value of the debate			1
opinion : @entity181 policy is the scandal , not just @entity11 's comments " what is the probability of an aroused woman getting pregnant versus the probability of a non-aroused woman getting pregnant ? @entity220 biased researchers probably know the answer to this question			1
regardless of the answer , why did he think it 's good politics to debate this stuff ? " however , one of the most inventive and educational responses to @entity11 's comments came from an academic website in @entity158 , posted by a professor of evolution and ecology who specializes in the biology of sexual conduct			1
" like almost everybody else i spoke to today , i was staggered , this morning , to hear @entity11 's comments about ' legitimate rape ' and pregnancy , " wrote @entity235 , from the @entity236 on @entity238 website			1
@entity243 questioned whether @entity11 was confusing human biology with that of @entity158 @entity246 , a species for whom forced copulation is impossible			2
" she has to mount him voluntarily and she is unlikely to do so unless he has a sexy song			0
but once she has mated him and he has attached a bag of his sperm ( a spermatophore ) to her abdomen , she often chooses to remove it before its entire contents enter her body , " he wrote			0
" perhaps this is the kind of thing @entity11 had in mind ? " on a more serious note , @entity243 wrote : " what strikes me about the anachronistic attitudes of evangelicals and their @entity181 puppets to abortion , contraception , family planning , female economic empowerment and feminism in general , is just how unambiguously male these attitudes are			0
" an entire political party in one of the most advanced and educated countries on earth has become a caricature of the most basal evolved insecurities about masculinity			0
they seem terrified of losing control over the means of reproduction and petrified of cuckoldry , " he said			0
experts : rape does not lower odds of pregnancy surviving sexual assault : share your testimony on @entity294 .			0
