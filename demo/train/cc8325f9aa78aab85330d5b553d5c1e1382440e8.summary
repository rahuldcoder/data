@entity38 in @entity39 were especially critical of what they saw as her lack of leadership shepherding through what they saw as an ill - conceived , ill - advised law			2
@entity48 sen. @entity47 went so far as to characterize her last october as the " laughingstock of @entity51			0
" but @entity0 , 65 , held on to her job , insisting @entity51 should n't abandon the legislation and all that it hopes to achieve			2
in an interview with @entity56 's @entity55 , she admitted that @entity11 did n't know of the website 's many technical problems until " the first couple of days " after it went live october 1			1
" there are people in this country who have waited for decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families , " @entity0 said , explaining why the website 's launch was n't pushed back despite anticipated problems			1

even granted the initial uproar over the website , her decision to resign was on her own accord , the officials said			2

other republicans were n't that gracious			0
rep. @entity124 of @entity125 said @entity0 ' departure " has been a long time coming after a litany of failures and total mismanagement			1
" not surprisingly , given the sharp partisan divide that defines the @entity4 debate , @entity130 came to her support			0
@entity10 minority leader @entity134 commended the outgoing health secretary for her dedication " to a single purpose : to make health care a right , not a privilege , for all @entity51			0
