@entity0 -- four years later , consider the role reversal : as he closes his convention , @entity4 's greatest challenge is to make the case against change			1
yet he ca n't ask the @entity9 people to simply stay the course			0
the challenge , both daunting and delicate , is to make the case that his first - term policies were correct but that the second - term results will be dramatically different			2
veteran @entity15 pollster @entity14 says the president 's challenge is to provide a clear and credible answer to this : " why will you be better off in the second term ? " and @entity14 argues that the stakes , already high , are higher still now because of the strong prime - time performances of first lady @entity24 and former president @entity25			1
" this convention is now a home run derby , " @entity14 said			1
four years ago in @entity28 , sen. @entity4 sold himself as the candidate of hope and change , presenting himself as a different brand of politician , someone who would change @entity35 -- and the economy -- for the better			1
@entity4 to speak after forceful @entity25 endorsement but if @entity35 has changed at all , it is for the worse			2
and while both sides can find statistics that support their arguments on the state of the economy , it is clear that many @entity9 at best feel they are treading water			0
so the tone is very different in @entity0 than in @entity28			1
four years ago , the goal was to expand the map , and the @entity4 campaign ultimately succeeded			1
this year , the path to 270 @entity53 votes and victory is less certain , though the president does have more viable options than does @entity58 nominee @entity57			0
still , because of the changed climate , the @entity4 acceptance speech will close a @entity15 convention that for the most part has been a giant get - out - the - vote rally , speakers chosen because of their appeal to specific constituencies ( african - americans , latinos , suburban women , gays and lesbians ) or major battleground states			1
the most sustained appeal to undecided or independent voters was wednesday 's prime - time dissertation by @entity25			1
speaking to supporters thursday morning , the president talked broadly about his test of convention success			2
" hopefully , at the end of this convention , people will say we accomplished what we needed to and delivered our vision for the country and offered a clear contrast to what people saw in @entity92 , " the president said			0
@entity4 readies two - term pitch while @entity0 has had plenty of contrast with the @entity58 convention in @entity92 , there has been virtually no specific talk of the president 's policy goals for the next four years			1
will he , like @entity57 , offer a specific jobs target ? will he offer a new deficit reduction goal ? venture into goals or timetables for immigration reform ? how the president packages his pitch also could be defining			0
for @entity109 , the second term was wrapped as " morning in @entity9			0
" @entity25 's 1996 bid for a second term was sold as his " @entity112			0
" thursday night , @entity4 's challenge is to sell his road map			1
and beyond the need to lay out a second - term policy agenda , some other @entity4 challenges are obvious			2
voters , albeit by a narrow margin , view @entity57 as better able to manage the economy			0
and while @entity4 leads when voters are asked which candidate best understands the middle class , the latest @entity1 / @entity125 polling showed that @entity57 significantly narrowed that gap as a result of the @entity58 convention			2
the president 's top political advisers see discouragement as their greatest potential enemy			0
proof of this is in a look at recent national polling : the president 's numbers among registered voters are stronger than his numbers among likely voters , meaning a fair share of potential @entity4 voters are n't as engaged or interested this time around			1
first lady seeks to reignite flame for president again , that is the strategy behind the convention agenda : careful targeting of the different pieces of the @entity4 2008 coalition			1
but for all the help he is getting from his friends , it is up to @entity4 himself to close the deal			0
now , the role of one speech should not be overstated			0
just hours after the convention closes , the government will release august jobs data -- and that data could significantly shape morning - after reflections on the president 's big moment			2
plus , there are two months of campaigning and three presidential debates ahead , so this is n't his last chance			0
but it 's a giant opportunity , his unfiltered chance to make the case against change .			0

stakes for @entity4 's speech are higher after two prime - time performances
@entity15 pollster : " this convention is now a home run derby "
targeting in @entity0 differs from the *messaging* in @entity28 four years ago
thursday night , @entity4 's challenge is to sell his road map
