the @entity1 stories of this week : the 10th anniversary of the start of the @entity27 , the @entity28 's attempt to modernize and president @entity30 's trip to @entity31			1
@entity32 : with @entity9 as a veteran of the @entity36 administration and @entity10 an @entity37 , there are sharp disagreements on the impact of the @entity27			1
i remain darkly fascinated by the enduring partisan divide over whether the war was a mistake -- with conservatives and liberals taking mirror image positions , and centrists and independents like myself pushing national opinion over to the mistake side of the ledger			0
one contemporary question : is intervention fatigue slowing @entity55 's impulse to stop the slaughter in @entity57 , where more than 70,000 have been killed while the world watches ? @entity28 modernization : with the @entity28 releasing an " autopsy " report on the mistakes that were made throughout the 2012 election , @entity9 is marking the release of the paperback edition of her book " @entity67 : how a @entity68 of conservatives can save the @entity28			1

@entity30 in @entity31 : after being attacked throughout the election as being a weak ally to @entity31 , @entity30 was given the red carpet treatment this week			1
