dressing oversights -- and easy ways to fix them			1
problem : incorrectly hemmed jeans solution : a good tailor do n't cut off the extra length and at the same time lose the nice crisp hemline ( marked by the recognizable yellow thread )			1
" a good tailor should be able to preserve the original hem , " says @entity11 , owner of @entity12 , in @entity13			1
with very long pants , your tailor may have to cut off a bit of fabric above the hemline and reattach the original hems ( with barely noticeable blue thread that matches the denim ) , but the task can usually be achieved by folding a hem up accordion - style and sewing it in place , so the original finished seam is in plain view			1
@entity29 : how to dress for any occasion problem : peds in plain view solution : partial peds your secret weapon against blistered toes is a pair of @entity39			1
but make sure they 're truly a secret weapon			2
" @entity44 are a classic faux pas , " says @entity42 , author of " @entity43 ? : the @entity46 " ( @entity47 , $ 15 , @entity48 )			2
to avoid peekaboo nylons , skip the skimpy stockings altogeter or try @entity51 ( $ 15 for three pairs , barenecessities.com ) , which cover only the front half of the foot			2
a bit of padding on the bottom provides a cushion and keeps the cover from sliding and scrunching into the toe of your shoe			2
@entity29 : avoiding wardrobe blunders problem : unopened vent solution : scissors jackets , blazers , and skirts often come with vents that are tacked together with thread			1
" do n't forget to snip the string once you bring your item home from the store , " says @entity73 , author of " @entity74 for women : 101 mistakes you ca n't afford to make ... and how to @entity78 " ( @entity79 , $ 17 , @entity48 )			2
besides being a potential source of embarrassment , a tacked - together vent may also increase your chances of ripping your garment when you take a large step or reach for something on the top pantry shelf			2
@entity29 : old clothing gets a second life problem : a gaping blouse solution : velcro your favorite shirt was dried once too often , and now it 's a bit snug , with buttons that appear to be hanging on for dear life			1
" you do n't want your coworkers staring at your chest , waiting for a button to pop off onto the conference table , " says @entity105 , cohost of @entity107 's " @entity106			2
" to avoid this scenario , sew a small piece of @entity99 between the buttons or use a piece of double - stick tape			1
that way your shirt will stay flush against your skin , buttons will remain attached , and your assets will be tucked away from @entity122 in @entity124 's sight			2
problem : cropped pants with boots solution : taller boots once considered a summer - only staple , capri pants are now available in thicker , fall - friendly fabrics , such as wool and tweed			0
but do n't wear them with your lowest pair of boots			1
" low ankle boots paired with cropped pants look dowdy , because they break up your silhouette , " says @entity139 , cohost of @entity107 's " @entity106			0
" " wearing high boots that completely cover the calves and a few inches of skin underneath the pants has a more elongating effect , " she says			0
@entity29 : new uses for things in your closet problem : @entity154 lingerie solution : a nude bra white underwear may seem demure and understated next to that rack of red lace skivvies in the department store , but it screams " look at me ! " when worn under white clothing			0
if you want your unmentionables to be unnoticeable underneath a favorite white t - shirt or blouse , wear a bra that is close to your skin tone ( this holds true for all underwear )			1
problem : visible tag solution : seam ripper your @entity175 mattress may have come with a @entity178 label , but your brand - new scarf did n't			1
so throw needless caution to the wind and snip the tags on scarves , sheer blouses , and any other wardrobe piece with an unsightly label			0
use a seam ripper in lieu of scissors to easily remove stitches holding the tag in place , but beware of tags sewn directly into a seam , says @entity195 , founder of the @entity196 , a backstage - management company for fashion shows			1
for these use a small pair of scissors to cut the tag just below the seam ( so the tiny bit of tag is barely noticeable )			1
@entity29 : dress to flatter your figure problem : a bare midriff solution : layering pant rises have gotten lower ( and lower ) , but shirts , sweaters , and blouses have stayed the same			0
the result ? an exposed midsection that leaves you looking like a teen pop sensation			0
rather than banishing your favoriteâ € and most flattering -- pair of pants to the back of the closet , layer a lacy tank top underneath a sweater			1
a hint of added color and texture keeps your tummy hidden and creates a more interesting , modern look			0
another benefit : um , how about warmth ? problem : visible panty line solution : smooth briefs you want all the attention on you , not your tush			0
a visible panty line draws attention to your backside ( making it look larger ) , but do n't assume a lifetime of wearing thongs is your only option			0
" panties are more demure and chic , and they are also a lot more comfortable , " says @entity245 , creative director of @entity246			0
jockey @entity251 briefs ( $ 9.50 , jockey.com ) have flat seams that are only 1/8 inch wide , preventing them from cutting into your skin			0
these full - coverage briefs end below the curvature of your bottom , completely covering ( not bisecting ) the area where pants tend to be most snug			0
bonus : the spandex briefs are as soft as your most lived - in t - shirt			0
