-- @entity2 co-founder and ceo @entity1 burst into the public 's consciousness as the awkward , hoodie - wearing @entity7 kid who cooked up a website in his dorm room and went on to earn billions from it			1
but in the past year , he 's begun to leverage his deep pockets -- he 's worth about $ 16 billion -- and high profile as an advocate for issues beyond the company 's @entity15 , @entity17 , offices			1
whether it 's pledging to spread internet access to the world 's poorest corners , as he announced wednesday , or plunking down millions to encourage kids to become scientists , @entity1 has evolved into a big - time player , willing to put himself forward for issues he believes in			1
the web evangelist @entity1 on wednesday announced @entity29 , a new nonprofit devoted to spreading web access to the nearly 5 billion people around the world who do n't have it			1
calling access to the @entity37 a human right , @entity1 told @entity0 the organization will focus on the mobile web , which is the way many people in poor and developing nations get online			1
it 's also , perhaps not coincidentally , an area where @entity2 has focused heavily on expanding its reach and revenue			2
but @entity1 says the effort is n't designed to be self - serving			1
" if we really just wanted to focus on making money , the first billion people who are already on @entity2 have way more money than the next 5 or 6 billion people combined , " @entity1 said			1
" it 's not fair , but it 's the way that it is			0
and , we just believe that everyone deserves to be connected , and on the @entity37 , so we 're putting a lot of energy towards this			0
" the immigration reformer at first glance , immigration reform does n't seem like a natural cause for an @entity37 billionaire			1
but @entity63 took the lead this month in bringing together tech luminaries to form @entity66 -- a group advocating for @entity67 to reform the nation 's immigration system			1
tech companies mostly benefit from the federal government 's @entity72 program , which makes it easier for highly skilled workers in fields like computer programming to emigrate to the @entity78 but the group advocates equally for issues like helping undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children			1
the group has pumped millions of dollars into things like a tv ad urging @entity67 to " fix our broken immigration system			0
" the bipartisan backer @entity89 has an uneasy relationship , at best , with @entity91			0
but in recent months , @entity1 has begun spreading the wealth around			2
does the @entity2 founder " like " @entity94 or @entity95 ? it 's complicated			2
early this year , @entity1 hosted a fundraiser for @entity95 @entity99 governor -- and potential presidential candidate -- @entity101 , with whom he has partnered on education issues ( see below )			1
but he would later do the same favor for a @entity99 @entity104 -- @entity106 mayor @entity105 ( see same )			0
@entity1 hosted a town hall meeting at @entity2 for president @entity108 in 2011			1
but his @entity66 group has helped fund campaign ads for conservative @entity95 senators like @entity113 's @entity112 and @entity115 's @entity114 , considered swing votes for the immigration bill in their chamber			0
it may be unclear which lever @entity1 tends to pull at the voting booth			2
but when he picks up the phone , politicians answer			0
the health - science patron @entity1 spearheaded an effort early this year designed to spur innovation that has nothing do with social media or mobile apps			1
instead , it 's for saving lives , or making them better			0
he helped create the @entity133 , an annual award given to researchers whose work is " aimed at curing intractable diseases and extending human life			0
" the award pays recipients $ 3 million each -- twice as much as a @entity141 -- and is also funded by tech leaders like @entity144 's @entity143 and @entity147 board chairman @entity145			0
" society has a lot of heroes for a lot of different things , but we do n't have enough heroes who are scientists and researchers and engineers , " @entity1 told @entity0 in february			2
" we 're just trying to set up this ... to reward and recognize the amazing stuff these folks are doing			0
" the philanthropist @entity1 has n't shied away from giving back			2
in fact , last year he was the second-most generous giver in the @entity78 , according to the @entity162			2
he does n't have any direct personal ties to @entity106 , @entity99			0
but in 2010 , he pledged a whopping $ 100 million of his fortune to helping out troubled schools there			0
the money was the first gift from @entity169 : education , a foundation created by @entity1 to help schools			1
joined by @entity105 and @entity101 , @entity1 took to " the @entity173 " to announce the donation and foundation			2
cynics noted that the gift came shortly before the release of " @entity179 , " the fictionalized film on @entity2 's birth that many believed cast @entity1 in a negative light			1
but his philanthropy did n't stop there			0
@entity1 later pledged an even bigger sum , nearly $ 500 million , to the @entity187 , which issues grants for a host of causes in the @entity192 area			1
in 2012 , its charitable causes ranged from programs that teach immigrants @entity197 to groups providing food and shelter to the needy to funds for victims of the @entity17 wildfires			0
