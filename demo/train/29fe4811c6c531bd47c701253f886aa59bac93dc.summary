-- november 8 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : hope you 're rested up and that you had a great weekend -- it was an hour longer at least ! i 'm @entity18 welcoming you to this november 8th edition of @entity0 ! first up : president visits @entity4 @entity21 : president @entity22 is on the road ; he 's taking a 10 - day trip throughout @entity25 ; he 's visiting @entity4 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
he arrived in the @entity4 capital on sunday -- you see him here with the first lady -- and one of the first things he pushed for was increased trade between @entity4 and the @entity35			1
@entity35 president @entity22 : i 'm here because the partnership between @entity4 and the @entity35 , i believe has limitless potential to improve the lives of both @entity35 and @entity4 , just as it has the potential to be an anchor of security and prosperity and progress for @entity25 and for the world			1
@entity21 : but @entity35 critics are concerned about @entity35 jobs when it comes to @entity4			1
the president says that a healthy relationship between the two countries will create @entity35 jobs , but critics say it 's actually the opposite when @entity35 businesses outsource jobs to the southeast @entity25 country			1
@entity55 @entity21 : hopelessness : that 's the word that pretty much describes the feeling in many parts of @entity5			1
this is a small , and very poor , @entity60 nation that has endured a catastrophic earthquake , spreading disease , and most recently this year , a glancing shot from @entity65			2
so it may not come as a surprise why many of the people in this report by @entity71 seem to have just given up			2
( begin video ) @entity73 , @entity0 correspondent : and then came @entity65			2
@entity74 now overwhelms @entity5 , just as easily as the flood waters did			2
@entity76 , @entity77 [ @entity78 ] : this water now came by and washed away anything we had left			2
@entity82 : @entity84 @entity83 wades through filthy water only to return to his earthquake ravaged home			2
this is @entity89 , the very epicenter of january 's epic quake , and now , it has seen some of the worst flooding			1
and yet for this , there is gratitude			2
@entity97 spared them the worst			2
this is what the @entity101 family has been left with			2
there is water all over their home and this muddy soot , they are thankful that the water has started to recede but now they 're left with this muddy soot			2
and so they try to clean up and recover once more			2
many tell us , they 've had it , their spirit broken			0
the quake , the continuing threat of cholera , the indignity of scavenging to survive , and now more water			0
@entity122 tells us he lost his leg to the earthquake , now @entity97 has taken everything else			0
@entity126 , @entity77 [ @entity78 ] : this is all i could save , my crutches			0
@entity82 : it 's difficult to comprehend that in the shadow of homes crushed by the quake , @entity5 must now somehow survive			1
so little has changed here since january			0
outside @entity5 there is talk of donor fatigue , but inside @entity5 , they 're sick of something else : all the attention			0
they say it raises their expectations for help , and crushes them once more when it fails to turn up			0
@entity145 [ @entity78 ] : we always have foreigners come and talk to us and offer help , they take our stories , they take advantage of us and it 's about time this ends			1
@entity82 : @entity65 ' last lash may be behind them but many @entity5 tell us they no longer believe anyone can help them when the next calamity strikes			0
( @entity157 ) is this legit ? @entity0 student news : is this legit ? a marathon is 13.1 miles long			1
not legit ! a marathon is twice this distance : 26.2 miles from start to finish ! @entity163 @entity21 : temperatures in the low forties , 26 miles of non-stop running : the @entity163 is n't for the faint of heart -- or foot			1
on the other hand , @entity170 does n't seem to be faint of anything			0
he was one of the 33 @entity174 miners who spent 69 days trapped underground			0
and he actually trained while he was down there , running miles through the mine tunnel every day ! @entity170 hit the @entity6 pavement on sunday along with more than 40,000 other competitors			1
the winners were also from abroad : an @entity182 man who 'd never run a marathon before had a time of two hours and eight minutes			1
and the women 's winner , a @entity187 , finished in about two hours , 28 minutes			1
@entity170 managed to finish the race in 5 hours and 40 minutes , which was a little faster than he expected			0
discovery stays put @entity21 : this is n't where @entity190 was supposed to be by now ; it should have been docked at the international space station			0
but its launch was delayed again on friday because of a hydrogen leak found near one of @entity190 's fuel tanks			1
this happened after gas leaks , electrical problems and bad weather			0
all that caused earlier delays of the 39th mission of the soon - to - be terminated shuttle program			0
@entity190 is @entity206 's oldest , and most experienced , shuttle ; its first mission was in 1984			1
after finding the hydrogen leak , scientists expect it 'll be november 30th , at the earliest , before @entity190 flies again , on what is supposed to be its last mission			0
this day in history ( @entity214 ) november 8 , 1793 -- the @entity215 , @entity216 's renowned museum , opens to the public november 8 , 1837 -- @entity218 , @entity35 's first college dedicated exclusively to women , opens in @entity221 november 8 , 1895 -- @entity222 discovers x-rays while researching electric current @entity225 @entity0 student news : time for the shoutout ! who said , " nothing ever comes to one , that is worth having , except as a result of hard work " ? you know what to do ! was it : a ) @entity237 , b ) @entity239 , c ) @entity241 , or @entity242 ) @entity236 ? three seconds , and go ! @entity237 was talking about raising money when he wrote these famous words			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! career connections @entity21 : examples of how hard work pays off can be seen in our " @entity249 " segment with our own associate producer , @entity254			1
@entity254 ? @entity255 , associate producer : @entity18 , those words you mentioned -- " hard work " ? well , the professionals we 've talked to strongly believe in it			1
this week , the spotlight is on production assistant @entity264			1
she says being a @entity266 , well , it 's all about what you make it			1
and she knows it 's putting her on the right path to achieving her goal of being a producer			1
( begin video ) @entity274 , @entity0 production assistant : my role is to basically do whatever the producers need me to do			1
that can include anything from logging to making sure i have all the stuff ready for the editors to go through			0
first of all a @entity283 is sound on tape			0
logging is transcribing or writing down word for word what everybody is saying. , so the reason that we 're able to pick the pieces of sound that we do is that somebody has to actually go through and write down everything that was said in that entire piece of video			0
creating a precut is getting that piece of video or that piece of sound that we plan on airing ready for the editor			0
all the things you learn as a production assistant , none of your time is wasted			1
you learn so many basic , good skills that you 're going to have to use for the rest of your career			1
so when you 're a producer you basically make the judgment calls on what you 're going to put in that show that day			0
but you can also look back on your production assistant days , remember when you were doing all that logging and making all those numbers and you can think , hmm , now i know what all that stuff was for			1
the advice that i would give is if your school has a broadcasting program make sure you are in that program			0
find out what your passion is , because whenever you find out something that you really feel strongly about and you have a good background in it , whatever you decide to do it wo n't feel like work			0
it will feel like something you 're doing for fun because you 're interested in it			0
( @entity157 ) before we go @entity21 : historians do n't know why there were so few @entity338 baseball cards			0
@entity338 was a speedy shortstop nicknamed " @entity339 , " played from 1897 to 1917 , mostly with @entity340			0
he was in the very first @entity341 ever , had more than 3,400 hits , and appears on one of the rarest cards on the planet			0
this particular card was left to a group of @entity349 nuns by one nun 's brother			2
they put it up for auction last week and the card brought them almost 263,000 dollars ! goodbye @entity21 : that money will pay for their charity work in 35 countries so you can understand why the honus was on them to sell the card			2
all right , if you did n't get that , or like it , we 'll just have to take another swing tomorrow			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity18 .			0
