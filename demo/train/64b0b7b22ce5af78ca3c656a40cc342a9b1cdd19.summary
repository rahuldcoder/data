-- citing an escalation in violence , the @entity1 called off its monitoring mission in @entity5 this weekend			1
the announcement came just days after the @entity5 government agreed to a one - month extension of the mission			1
the sudden change in policy " surprised " the government , according to the state - run @entity12			0
it also signaled a new phase in the @entity1 's handling of the crisis			2
in november , the @entity1 voted to suspend @entity5 from its ranks			1
a couple of weeks later , it initiated sanctions against the country			2
one month later , monitors were sent in			0
the next step appears to be a @entity25 resolution			0
the council is set to consider a draft resolution , presented by @entity1 member @entity28 , that calls on @entity5 president @entity30 to step down and transfer power			1
" @entity1 have now exhausted their own internal options and they can be seen to have taken action themselves to try to resolve the crisis , " said @entity32 , a @entity33 professor from @entity34			2
" it would now seem legitimate for the @entity1 to now turn to larger bodies , certainly the @entity40 , to take action itself			1
" the @entity1 , aka the @entity1 , was created in 1945 to promote closer relations -- politically , economically , culturally and socially -- among its members			2
the first group consisted of six @entity47 countries : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity5 and @entity52 ( now @entity53 )			1
since then , it has swelled to 22 members , including the @entity56			0
the @entity1 is one of many regional unions worldwide			1
these type of groups , such as the @entity60 , the @entity61 and the @entity62 , involve neighboring countries trying to work together for the good of the whole			0
for much of its history , however , the @entity1 has been viewed as a toothless organization , @entity32 said			1
he told @entity0 he was surprised when 18 of its members voted in favor of suspending @entity5			1
" @entity1 will still be seen as the agent of brutal , corrupt regimes : of the 22 @entity1 member states , only three members are even vaguely democratic , and of them only @entity74 has had internationally recognized free and fair elections , " he said in november			2
" but the decision does show that now the @entity77 may have to start recognizing the power of the ballot box in its relations with neighbors			0
" @entity82 : where is @entity5 crisis heading ? early last year , the @entity1 suspended @entity86 's membership , condemning @entity88 's regime for attacking peaceful protesters			1
within months , the @entity25 voted to impose a no - fly zone over the country , and @entity88 was history soon after			0
are we now witnessing a stronger , more assertive @entity1 ? " we 've seen this organization move toward the idea of intervention on behalf of the people , which is something they steadfastly would not do in the past , almost no matter what , " said @entity94 , a professor at the @entity95 who spent 19 years working for the @entity96			2
@entity94 says the @entity103 has clearly sent a message to the powers - that - be			0
" i think there is a sense that they have to be on the right side of the issue more than they have wanted to be in the past , or else they suffer potential increasing irrelevance in that part of the world , " he said			0
before recent interventions in @entity86 , @entity119 and now @entity5 , many of the @entity47 people did n't take the @entity1 seriously , said @entity120 , a native of @entity5 and coordinator of the @entity123 and @entity122 at @entity124			1
" we did not even look at them , " @entity120 said			0
" but i would say they 're gaining more momentum from the mainstream			0
... finally , we can see a serious @entity1 that can take initiative and help the @entity5 people			1
" @entity132 said he and many other @entity5 are still taking a cautious approach , as the @entity1 still has much to prove and it remains to be seen what becomes of the @entity40 resolution			1
but it 's clear that there has been a meaningful shift			0
" we may see ( the @entity1 ) as weak - kneed and autocrat - loving and - protecting , turning the blind eye to all kinds of excesses going on in their countries , " @entity94 said			1
" but we have to also understand that this is a vastly different part of the world ( not familiar with ) participatory democracies			0
they 're busy taking baby steps on a long road , and over the last year they have taken a significant journey on this road			0
" the mere fact that the @entity1 and other @entity47 leaders have become more willing to intervene on the behalf of people 's safety , security and well - being in one another 's countries is a significant step forward			2
" @entity0 's @entity160 and @entity161 contributed to this report .			0

for much of its history , the @entity1 has been viewed as a weak regional power
the group has come down hard on @entity5 , however , suspending it in november
after sanctions and a failed monitoring mission , it is now turning to the @entity40
