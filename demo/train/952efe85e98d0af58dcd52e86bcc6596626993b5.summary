@entity0 -- authorities in @entity4 questioned people at a mosque and a school in the capital of @entity11 because the facilities were attended by attempted bombing suspect @entity13 , the spokesman for @entity4 's @entity3 to the @entity5 said tuesday			1
@entity14 told @entity1 's " @entity24 " that conversations with @entity13 's former acquaintances have not yet turned up links to the local @entity19 group , which has claimed responsibility for @entity13 's attempt to bring down a @entity23 flight on christmas day			1
" according to the questionings carried on today by his classmates and administrative officials of the school , [ @entity29 ] was a friendly person and did not ring any alarm bells , " he said			0
" we knew he attended school in @entity4 , and one of the mosques he was visiting in @entity11 we 've been surveilling and questioning some of the people there to see whether he has links or not , " he said			2
@entity40 also said a claim by @entity42 that the attempt was in retaliation for airstrikes against them was " most likely " propaganda , but left open the possibility links could be found later			1
" i think the @entity19 statement that came out recently saying that this is an attack in retaliation for what happened the 17th and 24th of december is unfounded , because we know that he bought the ticket a few days before that , so there 's no link for the time being , " @entity14 said			2
see key dates in the failed bombing attempt @entity13 bought his ticket to travel from @entity63 , @entity64 , to @entity65 , @entity66 , via @entity67 the day before the first attack , according to @entity64 officials			2
@entity42 issued an internet statement claiming responsibility for @entity73 's failed attempt to bring down @entity74 , calling it retaliation for what it said were @entity5 airstrikes on @entity4 soil			1
@entity40 said airstrikes against @entity42 on december 17 and december 24 were launched entirely by the @entity4 government , but acknowledged that the @entity5 has provided the country with some assistance since the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks			1
" the @entity5 has been supporting @entity4 since 9/11 , training our forces , " he said			2
" we have a strong intelligence cooperation , but again the last operations and all the operations this year were carried out by @entity4 forces			0
" @entity5 officials privately acknowledge they have provided secret intelligence on several @entity19 in the @entity94 targets to @entity4 's government , but wo n't say whether @entity5 aircraft or drones took part in the strikes			1
@entity100 rejected suggestions that @entity4 has not been strong enough in its fight against @entity42 , but noted the nation has " a serious problem			0
" " we 've been addressing this problem way before it became a global issue , " he said			0
" since 1992 , we 've been fighting			0
i call it the long war			0
@entity42 , we 've been conducting strikes against them since that day			0
