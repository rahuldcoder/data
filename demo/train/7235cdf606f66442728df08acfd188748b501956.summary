-- on monday , the team of grave diggers at @entity3 in @entity4 prepared 15 graves , their busiest morning yet			1
and they 're preparing for more			1
one of the slots was for 5 - year - old @entity8			1
he and eight members of his family were killed sunday in an @entity12 airstrike on their home			1
their bodies were carried through the street to the sound of gunfire under @entity21 banners to the cemetery			1
after the crowd left and the chanting stopped , friends and relatives prayed quietly			1
@entity12 officials say the airstrike was targeting a @entity21 military official , though no @entity21 official is known to be among the dead			1
fear in @entity12 despite @entity32 @entity4 's main cemetery is located outside the city , near the border with @entity12 and , therefore , too dangerous for funerals			1
so , on monday , relatives were taking their dead to the @entity3 , which is technically full			1
back where @entity8 's home once stood , mourners greeted an @entity42 delegation led by @entity43 , head of the @entity44 , the political wing of the @entity46			1
a member of the delegation vowed vengeance against @entity12 for the deaths of @entity52 children -- caught in a struggle they were too young to comprehend			1

" today , 116 rockets were launched from @entity4 into @entity12 , " @entity70 spokeswoman lt. col. @entity69 told @entity0			1
" that was not a quiet day			2
" the view in parts of this strip of land -- about twice the size of @entity78 , and home to 1.7 million residents -- reveals the kinds of images that news networks typically show after massive earthquakes : mounds of rubble , lifeless bodies , survivors -- some wailing , others appearing bewildered			2
what 's different this time but the forces shaping @entity4 's pockmarked landscape monday were no act of @entity97 , residents here said on the sixth consecutive day of @entity12 's attack			1
as darkness fell , the city 's streets were deserted , quiet but for the constant buzz of drones overhead and the occasional blast of a missile either being launched or landing			2
on one street , a blast on sunday hurled a boulder - sized chunk of road through the roof of a two - story building where two children and their family were living			1
" the babies were under the rubble -- here and here , " their aunt told @entity0 as she pointed to the chalky wreckage			2
" they were sleeping with their father over here			2
suddenly , the house collapsed			2
the brother ran to them			2
he found them under this rock			2
" relatives say the 2 - year and 4 - year - old were fatally crushed ; a nearby boulder was tinged red , the remains of the room covered in dirt			1
in an apartment below , the children 's 22 - year - old mother was wearing a black hijab that covered all but her eyes			1
" i am in shock , " she said			0
" i do n't believe it			0
they are priceless to me			0
my life now is very difficult			1
" she put her hands over the slit in the fabric over her eyes , bowed and shook			0
online campaign seeks to stop the violence the air strike occurred at about 1:30 a.m. by the time @entity0 arrived a few hours later , a bulldozer was moving piles of dirt into what neighbors said had been a crater left by the blast			0
a few streets away , people were picking through a similar landscape			0
the roof of a three - story building lay on the ground			1
a few yards away , a man in a green t - shirt held his head in his hands as he surveyed the wreckage			1
he said he had been warned			0
" the @entity70 called us , " he said			0
" at first , we did n't believe them			0
then they hit us with a small rocket on the roof			0
ten minutes after that , they hit the house			0
" by then , the residents of the house had evacuated			0
still , 15 neighbors were wounded in the ensuing attack , he said			0
the @entity12 military said it could not confirm it was responsible for either hit in a neighborhood known for having launched rockets toward @entity12			0
