@entity0 -- the @entity2 advised employees last month not to answer questions from journalists , the @entity6 or the agency 's inspector general , according to an @entity2 e-mail made public monday			1
@entity11 sen. @entity10 has said the @entity2 is becoming a " secretive , dangerous ally of polluters			0
" " please do not respond to questions or make any statements , " the june 16 e-mail said , advising staff to direct questioners to senior staff members cleared to answer questions from outside the agency			1
@entity22 , chief of staff of the @entity2 's compliance assurance division , sent the e-mail to 11 managers in the department			2
the e-mail was posted on a web site of the @entity29			0
the group , an alliance of state and federal environmental professionals , labeled the communication a " gag order			1
" " the order reinforces a growing bunker mentality within an @entity2 that is the subject of a growing number of probes into political interference with agency operations , " the group said			2
@entity2 press director @entity43 rejected that characterization , saying the e-mail was about efficiency , not secrecy			2
the memo was a response to a may 2007 audit by the inspector general 's office that found the @entity2 did not respond earlier to @entity53 reports on problems with water enforcement and other issues , the @entity48 reported			1
the audit , however , did not make any recommendations governing communication between staff and the inspector general 's office			1
" a senior staffer in the enforcement office sent out an e-mail to simply help her office efficiently respond to requests from the press , @entity6 and @entity2 's inspector general , " @entity43 told @entity1			1
" there is nothing in the procedure that restricts conversation between enforcement staff , the press , @entity6 and the @entity53 , " she said , adding it is " consistent with existing agency polices			0
" @entity43 is one of the people to whom recipients of the memo were told to direct journalists ' questions			0
in a written statement , the @entity2 's @entity82 said it did not approve the language of @entity22 's warning and advised , " all @entity2 officials and employees are required to cooperate " with the office			2
" this cooperation includes providing the @entity82 full and unrestricted access to @entity2 documents , records , and personnel , " the statement read			0
" we are currently engaged in discussions with @entity96 [ @entity97 ] to assure that @entity82 and @entity96 interpretations are consistent in this matter			0
" and sen. @entity10 , a @entity11 @entity101 who has long battled with the agency 's administrator , @entity102 , said the instructions showed that @entity102 is " turning the @entity2 into a secretive , dangerous ally of polluters , instead of a leader in the effort to protect the health and safety of the @entity112 people			0
" last week , @entity102 denied a request to appear before two @entity115 committees to talk about whether the @entity2 's decisions comply with its staff 's legal and technical recommendations			0
the committee 's chairman , sen. @entity119 , @entity121 , has asked the inspector general 's office to assess the administration 's claims of executive privilege as it tries to keep documents related to @entity2 decisions from @entity129			1
@entity10 chairs the @entity130 on the @entity131 and public works			0
she is expected to hold a news conference tuesday to talk about what she calls " political interference in recent @entity2 decisions " and discuss " apparent contradictions between the sworn testimony " of @entity102 and accounts given by other sworn witnesses .			1
