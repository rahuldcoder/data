that is the phrase used by the parent of a @entity5 student , describing to a reporter what went on in the firehouse near the school as terrified mothers and fathers arrived in the minutes and hours after the shootings			2
the mothers and fathers looked anxiously for children who had lived through the shootings and had been brought into the firehouse			2
the surviving children and their parents found each other			1
but the other parents waited and waited			1
their sons and daughters did not appear			2
and as the mothers and fathers who had been reunited with their children left the firehouse to go to their homes , a list began to be compiled			0
on it were the names of the boys and girls who were not accounted for			0
the most heart - shattering and unbearable list that can be imagined			1
those 20 children , as they had left home for school earlier that day , were boys and girls who had favorite television shows , and @entity41 wish lists , and jokes that only they and their families understood , and brothers and sisters they knew they 'd be having dinner with			0
and parents , who now waited in the rapidly emptying @entity48 and rescue station			1
there are days when it seems fair to ask if part of @entity54 life has gone irretrievably insane			1
a description of the scene inside the elementary school , from a law enforcement official who spoke to a reporter , was that it resembled " a killing field			0
" that is a term of warfare , even of genocide , yet it seems not at all out of place in the context of contemporary domestic news			0
" we have lockdown drills , " said @entity69 , a library clerk at the school			1
she was explaining to reporters that the teachers , children and staff at @entity5 , like teachers , children and staff at elementary schools all across the @entity54 , were well versed in the advisability of preparing for a day like friday			1
more than half - a - century ago , children in elementary schools were trained in so - called duck - and - cover drills : the practice of diving under desks in case of nuclear attack by foreign enemies			1
even at the time , it felt kind of comical ; few boys and girls really believed that enemy aircraft were going to materialize over @entity96 or @entity97 or @entity98 skies , bearing atomic payloads -- and a schoolroom desk , even in children 's eyes , did n't promise much of a shelter against a bomb			2
@entity54 children tended to laugh and kid through the drills			1
today 's enemies seem considerably more real , and the children are taught to understand that			0
" the kids knew the routine , " the librarian said			2
thus , with the gunman in the school , she led the boys and girls to the lockdown - drill location : " between some bookcases and a wall , where you ca n't be seen from any windows			1
" and , because they were children , and not soldiers trained in responding to heavy weaponry , when she and her colleagues then led the children to a storeroom and locked the door , she did the only thing she could to calm them as shots rang through the school : passed out crayons and paper			0
we tend to talk about terrorism in terms of potential attacks from foreign shores , but on weekends like this one we have to acknowledge that the specter of terror seems to have become a part of the very atmosphere of @entity54 life			1
at a movie theater in @entity150 , a shopping mall in @entity151 , a school in a quiet @entity154 town ... the places change , the news media gather after the bloodshed , the police piece together the sequence of events , the grief counselors mobilize			0
and somehow it all feels like flailing			1
at the end of a weekend like this one , do we feel at all secure that , having learned what we can about what has happened , the knowledge will help to prevent the next day and place of carnage ? of course not			0
there is an old movie that is often played on television during the holiday season ; its very title bears a message of warmth and safety and affectionate december memories			0
" @entity41 in @entity154 , " the movie is called , and the words are meant to comfort and cheer			0
it was broadcast again nationally late last week as @entity54 settled in for what is supposed to be a season of kindness and gentle spirit			1
by the weekend in @entity154 , a law enforcement official , preparing to release the identities of the children who died , said that his colleagues were carefully compiling " a formal list of names , birthdates and information			0
" a resident of @entity190 told a television reporter : " things like this just are n't supposed to happen here			2
" no , they are n't			2
and " here " means not just @entity190 , not just @entity154 , but this country we all share			0
it 's not supposed to happen here			0
yet it does , again and again			0
and , in a season of peace , a strong , no - longer - young nation , blessed with so many people of compassion and wisdom and good will , finds itself in a bleak and familiar place -- unable to answer the most basic question of all : why ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

@entity215 describes parents ' *heartbreaking* wait for kids , many of whom did n't arrive
@entity215 : there are days we want to ask : has @entity54 gone insane ?
he says the joke of duck - and - cover drills has given way to *deadly* serious lockdown drills
@entity215 : we hear stories of attacks and what we should do , but it all feels like flailing
