@entity0 -- " flight " lands in theaters this weekend , but do n't look for the movie on the in - flight entertainment menu the next time you 're on a plane			1
the film opens with a catastrophic aircraft malfunction , forcing seasoned pilot @entity12 ( @entity13 ) to make a crash landing			1
first lauded as a hero for saving nearly everyone onboard , investigators later find out @entity12 had alcohol in his system			0
it 's just one of the nightmares played out in a host of @entity24 films you 'd probably rather be on terra firma to watch			1
" i keep saying this was born out of my two greatest fears : drinking myself to death and dying in a plane crash , " screenwriter @entity27 told @entity1			1
" it 's like , wrap those two fears together and put it in this movie			0
" review : @entity0 keeps " flight " grounded " i much prefer my disasters to happen in a movie than in real life , " said " flight " director @entity37			1
" i 'm not afraid to fly			0
i read the statistics , and i do believe that flying is the safest form of transportation , much safer than driving in a car			1
" not all of the cast share the same confidence			0
@entity50 , who plays whip 's best friend and enabler wo n't be watching " flight " or any other airplane disaster movie while flying			1
" oh , @entity56 i hope not , " @entity50 said			0
" i do better without thinking , but i 've had trouble flying for a long time			1
" @entity0 shrugged off any suggestion that his work on the film could make him a nervous flier			1
" i mean , it 's just a movie , " @entity13 said			1
" well , worrying about it is n't going to change anything , so i do n't worry about it			0
" @entity68 , who plays a @entity70 investigator in the film , is similarly unconcerned about life imitating art. " you know , i 've done a handful of ' @entity76 ' in my day			1
what , am i going to worry that i 'm gon na become a murderer ? " she said			0
" as i pass the pilots in the airport , i like to feel that they 're incredibly responsible people who understand the responsibility they 're taking on			0
" while flying is certainly statistically very safe , " flight " brings to mind more than a few films that could make even the most confident passenger jittery			1
here are 10 more movies that might be better to watch on the ground			2
" airport " this 1970 drama takes off with a blizzard , closed runways and a suicide bomber planning to blow up a @entity94 so his wife can collect the insurance money			0
the blockbuster includes what @entity99 called " a cast of stars as long as a jet runway , " including @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
it won an @entity108 and was nominated for nine others , including best picture			0
three sequels followed , including " @entity112 , " in which a small plane slams into a 747 , " @entity114 , " in which a 747 crashes and sinks to the bottom of the ocean with passengers trapped aboard , and " @entity119 : the @entity124 , " in which the supersonic jet has to avoid attack and make an unusual emergency landing			2
" airplane ! " while " @entity132 " played terror in the sky as a serious drama , " airplane ! " ( 1980 ) , starring @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 plays it as farce			1
when the pilots are sickened by their fish dinners , it 's left to @entity137 ( @entity130 ) to land the plane safely			2
" it is sophomoric , obvious , predictable , corny , and quite often very funny			0
and the reason it 's funny is frequently because it 's sophomoric , predictable , corny , etc. , " wrote critic @entity140 at the time			0
@entity144 mention : " @entity145 , " the 1957 film that took virtually the same plot seriously and contributed much of the dialogue for " airplane ! " almost verbatim			1
" @entity150 " this intense drama takes place on the flight hijacked on 9/11 that eventually crashed into a field in @entity156 as passengers tried to regain control			2
the movie , made five years after the attacks , was described in 2006 by @entity161 as " a harrowing , documentary - style reenactment , in real time , of what might have happened on the one airplane that did n't fulfill the terrorists ' intended goals on sept. 11			1
" included in the cast are some @entity169 and military employees who were on duty and dealt with the hijacked plane on the day of the attacks			2
" @entity174 " even if you 're traveling with an anthropomorphic volleyball , the movie " @entity174 " ( 2000 ) could make you a bit jittery			0
a @entity180 executive , played by @entity181 , is the only survivor of a plane crash and is forced to learn to live stranded on a deserted island with only a @entity174 volleyball as a companion			2
" @entity186 " " all anyone really needs to know about this amusingly crude , honestly satisfying artifact is snakes + plane + @entity195 , " wrote the @entity187 at the time of the 2006 release			2
crate loads of hyped - up serpents start killing the cast in creative ways as @entity195 's character tries to figure out how to save the aircraft and the @entity203 informant onboard			2
" alive " this 1993 drama tells the true story of a plane crash in the icy @entity207 of @entity208			2
the crash is only the start of the survivors ' ordeal as they are forced to live on the treacherous mountainside facing starvation , the elements and the fact that they may never be rescued			0
" @entity218 " @entity219 picks the wrong plane to hijack because of the man who happens to be passenger 57			2
" @entity223 quips , glares , and kung fus his way through the role of @entity230 , a terrorism and hijacking expert who happens to be aboard the same plane as a terrorist hijacker , " wrote @entity161 at the time of the film 's 1992 release			1
a battle of wits ensues between @entity230 and @entity219 on the l - 1011 aircraft and in a @entity240 carnival			0
" @entity241 " a gremlin on the plane 's wing at 20,000 feet could make anyone 's flight a bit nerve - racking			1
the 1983 film ( with @entity254 ) and the tv episode ( with @entity256 ) 20 years earlier both feature men who see something out to sabotage the plane on the wing but ca n't get anyone else to believe them			1
" @entity258 , @entity258 " in this 1990 sequel , @entity259 returns as @entity261 to fight terrorists trying to free a captured @entity264 general by taking over @entity132 near @entity0 and trying to force planes circling overhead to run out of fuel			0
@entity261 , whose wife is on one of the planes , " places first in every event , including wrestling for guns , jumping onto conveyor belts , being ejected from cockpits , leaping onto the wings of moving airplanes and fighting with the authorities , " @entity140 wrote			0
" @entity278 " if you think you are out of the woods when your plane touches down , you might want to keep " @entity278 " ( 2004 ) stowed away			0
the film starring @entity181 revolves around a man trapped in legal limbo at @entity285			1
unable to return to his home country and unable to clear customs and enter the @entity288 , he 's forced to figure out how to survive inside the terminal			0
would you watch these on a plane ? what films would you add to our list ?			1

while flying is statistically very safe , many films dramatize worst - case *scenarios*
the new film , " flight , " starring @entity13 , is probably not a film to watch on a plane
" airplane ! " turns the conventions of an in - flight nightmare *upside* down , playing them as comedy
