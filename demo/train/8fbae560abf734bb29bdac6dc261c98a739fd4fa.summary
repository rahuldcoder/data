-- we 've been netiquette'ing for more than a year and a half now , and when we ask friends / acquaintances / the gaping maw of the internet for their burning questions and column suggestions , one anxiety pops up again and again and again			2
here it is , in @entity12 form : " my [ aunt / boss / elderly neighbor ] sent me a friend request on @entity16 , and i do n't want to accept because [ she still thinks of me as a squeaky clean 11 - year - old / i do n't want him to see pictures of me in a bathing suit / he is freaking @entity20 ]			1
but i know he or she will notice if i do n't accept because [ she only has 13 other friends / he said something about it at work / he is weirdly obsessed with me ]			2
what do i dooo ? " -- every @entity29 person ever well , @entity30 , today is your lucky day			0
you 've got several options , and we 're going to present them all to you right here , rapid fire , so you can stop freaking asking us about it already			0
with that , we give you : the @entity38 to the @entity39 : option 1 : ignore @entity40 was totally on to something with that whole repression thing			2
treat this friend request like all the other vaguely uncomfortable social issues hovering around your shoulders like miniature dementors ( the implied ask - out from that weird girl at work ! that college student 's persistent requests for an informational interview ! the voice mails of murmured @entity56 lyrics you keep leaving on your ex-girlfriend 's phone when you 've been hitting the sauce ! ) and sweep the whole thing under the rug			1
@entity16 even makes this the default now -- instead of totally rejecting a request , you simply hit " not now , " relegating it to the realm of " hidden requests			1
" hey , maybe your clueless would - be amigo will just think you never log into the ol ' @entity70			0
option 2 : accept -- with caution if you do n't feel comfortable relegating your contact to @entity73 , you can instead send him or her to the halfway house of your limited profile			2
then you tell @entity16 to , for example , not let certain people read the stupid things your friends post on your wall			1
@entity83 , of course , made this way more difficult than it needs to be			0
ok , deep breath : if you do n't already have a @entity89 list , click on " more " next to " lists " in the left - hand column and then click " create a list			0
" name it " @entity89 , " " professional contacts , " " creepers , " whatever			0
now surf on over to " privacy settings " under the arrow that 's always on the upper right			2
now [ another gasp ] click on @entity102 settings , " edit settings " next to " how you connect , " and , next to the last option ( " who can see @entity112 posts by others on your profile ? " ) , click " custom " and then provide the list name under the option " @entity108 from			0
" now accept your frenemy 's friendship , hover your mouse over " friends " and select your stealth list from the drop - down menu			1
this just takes care of others ' wall posts -- you have to go through a whole ' nother rigmarole to block your photo albums , for example			0
well , now that we 're exhausted and in need of more caffeine from writing that all out , i think we can all acknowledge that @entity16 privacy settings suck and this is probably the least time - efficient solution			1
but hey , if your boss really will freak out if you do n't hit @entity137 , it may be worth the trouble			0
option 3 : reject , and speak up sometimes , a little apologetic explanation will soothe the sting of rejection			1
give the person you just turned down a legit - sounding excuse the next time you see them in person ( or get them on the phone )			1
" as a rule , i 'm not really @entity16 friends with people i know professionally , but let me add you on @entity157 " is a perfectly reasonable thing to say , for example			1
just do the explaining in an oh - by - the - way tone ( not in a @entity16 message or e-mail -- too awkward ) and the person will mirror your niceness			2
option 4 : clean up , already cue the @entity164 : if you 're really not happy with the sloppy disaster of a profile you 're presenting , it might be time to clean up your image			1
remember , recruiters and employers have an almost uncanny ability to find pictures and updates that you thought were private			0
( mind - blowing actual exchange in @entity16 's official q&a : i set my photo album to friends , but others are seeing , liking and commenting on my photos			1
the fb team responds with the digital equivalent of a dismissive wave of the hand			0
) and snap after snap of you passed out next to a toilet ( or updates gleefully recounting your vomitacious episodes ) are just , well , trashy			0
rule of thumb : do n't put anything on @entity16 that you would n't want your aunt / boss / creepy neighbor seeing , even if you give them the big reject .			1

one of the ways to get around accepting a @entity16 friend request is ignoring it
there 's a *lengthy* yet effective process for limiting what info friends have access to
another possible way to *politely* avoid someone is to reject them and give an explanation
*whichever* tactic you use , now might be the time to clean up your @entity16 profile
