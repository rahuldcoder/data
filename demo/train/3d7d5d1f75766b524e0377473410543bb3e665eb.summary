he waved goodbye to his 6 - year - old brother and was shipped halfway around the world to the fields of @entity1 to fight the @entity12 , arriving the summer after he enlisted			1
his war lasted one hour			0
@entity3 was one of thousands of young men ordered to charge into @entity12 machine guns on the night of july 19 , 1916 , outside this neatly kept @entity1 village			1
the defenders mowed down thousands , killing so many the allies could not recover all their dead			1
that 's how @entity21 was fought -- waves of young men charging on foot at enemies who were dug in and waiting with guns at the ready			0
the remains of about 165,000 troops from the @entity30 alone have never been found , according to experts			1

about 1,600 @entity32 and @entity30 bodies were never recovered			1

two years ago , researchers found a series of mass graves near the site of the @entity0 battle			1
they contained 250 bodies buried by the @entity12 after the slaughter			2

so far , 96 bodies had been positively identified			1
on monday , the 94th anniversary of the battle , a new cemetery was dedicated to be their final resting place			1

@entity80 's @entity79 and @entity81 , the governor - general of @entity32 , marched behind the coffin of the last soldier to be interred at the cemetery , called @entity85			1

" particularly those who fought and died during the battle of @entity0 and the 250 soldiers whom we remember especially today , " @entity79 said			1

the younger @entity3 is himself an @entity4 veteran of @entity148 , and he sees a parallel between those who came home from the controversial @entity148 and those who never came home at all from the @entity21			0
