-- shock waves were felt throughout cricket on thursday when three @entity4 international players were sent to prison for their part in a betting scam against @entity8 in 2010			1
the trio , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 were handed differing jail terms after being found guilty of plotting to cheat during the match at @entity14 -- the home of @entity17 cricket			2
however , while @entity9 and @entity10 have been roundly condemned for their actions , which resulted in sentences of 30 months and 12 months respectively , in some quarters there has been a modicum of sympathy for 19 - year - old @entity11			0
@entity26 cricketers jailed in betting scam unlike his two , more experienced colleagues , @entity11 confessed to deliberately bowling no - balls ( foul deliveries ) in order to make money in a betting scam , with the judge , mr @entity34 , handing him a lesser sentence of six months , calling him " " impressionable "			1
and now @entity11 's mother and brother have told @entity0 they have sympathy for the teenager , believing he was coerced into agreeing to bowl no balls			1
speaking from her family home in @entity42 , one hour outside @entity43 , @entity11 's mother , @entity45 , told @entity0 's @entity46 : " he rose to stardom at the speed of light and has falling back down just as fast			1
" @entity11 still thinks like a child , he is very naive			0
i know that he was forced into doing this , he was n't greedy for money , " she added			0
" but in my heart i know that god is with him , and he will make a comeback in cricket with my prayers			0
" @entity11 's close friend @entity60 told @entity0 : " i have known @entity11 for eight or nine years , we lived together			1
i did not think he would ever do anything like this			0
" however , somebody who has no sympathy for @entity11 and his fellow - convicted teammates is @entity66 , the former head of the @entity68 's anti-corruption unit			1
speaking to @entity0 's @entity69 , following the announcement of the prison sentences , @entity66 said : " these guys betrayed their country and betrayed millions of cricket lovers around the world			2
" these players were idolized in @entity4 , but they betrayed everything for money so they deserve what they have got			2
" @entity66 added : " in my time with the @entity68 , i always said the most powerful message was if cricketers were dealt with criminally for these matters , otherwise cricket loses and millions of people also lose their confidence in the game			0
