-- " it 's about time ! " that was how a friend and fellow @entity4 responded to the news that cardinal @entity6 of @entity7 had been elected the first @entity9 pope in the nearly 2,000 - year history of the @entity11			1
it was one of those spontaneous utterances that , while not politically correct , was at least honest and heartfelt			0
and for wayward @entity16 like me , the election came at just the right moment			1
just how wayward ? i go to @entity19 five times a year , and it 's been almost 40 years since my last confession			1
even when i do go to church , i 'm what they call a " cafeteria catholic			1
" i pick and choose what i like from sermons and disregard the rest			1
i believe in the holy trinity , but i also believe in things that the @entity11 teaches me i should n't believe in -- like gay marriage and a woman 's right to choose			1
where does that leave me ? some of my fellow @entity16 would judge me harshly and accuse me of being insufficiently committed to our faith			1
i 'm good with my faith			1
i pray directly to @entity39 , and i do n't need an intermediary			0
what i 'm sufficiently committed to is my church , which frankly -- in light of its own sins -- is in no position to judge anyone			2
it 's because of the scandal involving sex abuse of young boys by priests that the @entity11 is -- in my life , and i 'm sure in the lives of other @entity16 -- hanging on by a thread			1
i 've been tempted to leave in disgust more than once			0
opinion : pope @entity6 a conservative who sides with the poor it does n't help that i live in @entity62 , in the shadow of the @entity64			1
the largest @entity4 archdiocese in the @entity67 , it was until recently under the control of cardinal @entity69			0
the archdiocese of @entity71 and @entity69 recently settled a child sex abuse lawsuit for nearly $ 10 million			2
@entity69 , who retired in 2011 , was accused of helping a confessed pedophile priest evade authorities			0
yet he was allowed to vote at the conclave in @entity75			0
as a @entity4 , it 's hard to be idealistic , cheery and hopeful when you live in @entity69 's backyard			1
there is always news coming out of that archdiocese , and it 's usually bad			2
even so , i 've come to accept that the @entity11 is home to me			0
it 's comfortable , familiar			2
when i go to weddings or funerals , i know instinctively that this is where i belong			0
the @entity11 is deeply flawed , and the new pope has a lot of work to do in terms of rebuilding the confidence of parishioners			2
but i ca n't go anywhere else			0
it 's human nature to want to see yourself reflected in an organization you belong to			2
it 's why mormons in the @entity67 were excited at the prospect of electing @entity103 president			2
it 's why @entity105 were just as eager in 2000 to elect @entity107 vice president			2
it 's why , in @entity110 cities like @entity111 or @entity112 or @entity113 , for generations the @entity115 voted for @entity115 candidates , and the @entity117 for @entity117 candidates			2
there are about 480 million catholics in @entity121 , and that 's not counting the 40 million to 50 million @entity123 in the @entity67 who are also @entity4			1
that accounts for nearly half of the 1.2 billion @entity16 on the globe			1
even for a people who often think not in terms of years but centuries , and who are famous for their patience , 20 centuries is a long , long time to wait for an acknowledgement that you exist , that you matter , and that you deserve respect			0
opinion : @entity7 a complex crucible for @entity139 now the wait is over			0
pope @entity6 is of @entity117 descent , but he was born in @entity142 in 1932			1
raised in @entity121 , he speaks @entity143 fluently and understands what life is like for the poor and downtrodden			0
as other commentators have rightly noted , the fact that he chose the name " @entity6 " -- in honor of @entity151 , the champion of the have - nots -- is a hint that he intends to focus the world 's attention on the issue of income equality			1
meanwhile , the news of a @entity9 papa has sent a jolt of euphoria through @entity7 and throughout @entity121			1
imagine winning the @entity165 times 10			0
there also will be a lot of excitement among @entity123 in the @entity67 , perhaps enough to reignite their passion for the @entity11 and bring them back to @entity19 lastly , the newly elected pope serves as a powerful symbol			0
he represents the people who represent the future of @entity176			0
as the first non-european elevated to pope in more than 1,200 years , the 76 - year - old instantly puts @entity121 on the map			0
this is one of the youngest regions on the map			0
if @entity184 harkens back to yesterday , then @entity121 represents tomorrow			0
after all , for @entity16 , this is a new day			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			1

@entity189 : for @entity16 , selection of a @entity9 pope has been long overdue
he says , like many , he 's a ' cafeteria catholic , " accepts some *doctrine* , *rejects* others
he says with abuse scandal church has made it hard to stay , new pope sends good signal
@entity189 : @entity6 pick is crucial *nod* to vast *cohort* of @entity9 catholics
