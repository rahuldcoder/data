@entity0 , @entity1 -- nine years after an @entity5 activist was crushed by an @entity1 army bulldozer , an @entity1 civil court ruled tuesday that @entity8 's death was an accident			1
@entity8 , 23 , was killed in 2003 while trying to block the bulldozer from razing @entity12 homes			1
her parents filed suit against @entity1 's @entity15 in a quest for accountability and sought just $ 1 in damages			2
but judge @entity19 ruled tuesday that the family has no right to damages , backing an earlier @entity1 investigation that cleared any soldier of wrongdoing			2
" i believe this was a bad day not only for our family , but a bad day for human rights , for humanity , for the rule of law and also for the country of @entity1 , " her mother , @entity26 , said after the verdict			2
" @entity8 's right to life and dignity were violated by the @entity1 military , " she said , adding that her daughter and her family deserve " accountability			1
" @entity42 says he did not see @entity5 activist " a civil lawsuit is not a substitute for a credible investigation , which we never had			0
this lawsuit was our only recourse as a family , " @entity26 explained			0
but the state prosecutor 's office said the driver of the bulldozer could n't see @entity8			1
" the death of @entity8 is without a doubt a tragic accident , " the office said in a statement			1
" as the verdict states -- the driver of the bulldozer and his commander had a very limited field of vision , such that they had no possibility of seeing ms. @entity8 and thus are exonerated of any blame for negligence			1
" @entity69 , the @entity8 family attorney , regards the decision as a " bad ruling " for the family and all activists			1
he said the @entity74 intend to appeal to @entity1 's @entity75			1
@entity1 government spokesman @entity76 countered criticism of the verdict by saying that " the whole idea that this was not a serious procedure is simply non-factual			2
" " they ( the @entity74 ) have lost a loved one , and we can all empathize with them , " @entity76 said			0
" but i thik their criticism of the @entity1 judiciary is unfounded			0
the @entity1 judiciary is known for its independence , which they fiercely guard			0
" @entity8 was nonviolently protesting the demolition of @entity12 civilian homes in @entity92 , @entity93 , when she died			1
she was working with the @entity12 - led @entity94 at the time			0
@entity8 's parents say they have searched for answers in their daughter 's death for years			1
" the more we found out , the more likely that the killing was intentional , or at least incredibly reckless , " father @entity99 said in 2010			0
" as a former soldier , i was even in charge of bulldozers in @entity104			0
... you 're responsible to know what 's in front of that blade , and i believe that they did			0
" @entity99 said the soldiers , too , are victims			0
he does not view them with disdain			0
" so i 'm not full of hatred for this person , but it was a horrendous act to kill my daughter , and i hope he understands that			0
" in 2010 , the @entity1 soldier who drove the bulldozer testified publicly for the first time -- from behind a partition			2
the driver 's identity has never been revealed , and he was not charged after a monthlong @entity1 investigation found that no @entity1 soldier was to blame			1
@entity8 's parents can not take him to court because the @entity1 @entity75 has upheld a decision to shield him			1
the driver testified repeatedly that he did not see @entity8 before he struck her , saying there was a pile of rubble impeding his vision			2
@entity134 , a member of the @entity135 and head of the @entity138 @entity137 , also condemned the ruling			2
she said that the evidence shows @entity8 was " deliberately murdered " and that the @entity1 court has victimized her again			1
" we must make sure that @entity8 's death is not a senseless incident , " @entity134 said in a statement			1
" it must be stressed that @entity1 's habit of blaming the victim and exonerating the criminal is not ( only ) applied to @entity12 victims , but also it has extended its reach to international solidarity activists and victims of @entity1 violence			1
" @entity155 said that the court upheld a " flawed @entity1 military investigation , completed within one month " of @entity8 's death and that the " verdict seems to have ignored substantial evidence presented to the court , including by eyewitnesses			1
" " @entity8 was clearly identifiable as a civilian , as she was wearing a fluorescent orange vest when she was killed , " said @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity166 advocacy director for @entity167			0
@entity171 spokeswoman @entity170 said the @entity5 has worked with the @entity74 " all through this process and we will continue to provide consular support			0
" " we understand the family 's disappointment with the outcome of the trial			0
under @entity1 law the family has the right to appeal the verdict and we 've seen reports that they are considering doing that			2
so we will see how this proceeds going forward			0
" since @entity8 's death , soccer players in @entity93 have honored the activist with an annual memorial tournament			1
" @entity8 : the @entity191 , " a wall near the makeshift concrete soccer field reads			0
" there 's never closure , " @entity26 said , " when you have a family member killed in such a way			0

the @entity202 's attorney says they intend to appeal
prosecutor 's office : @entity8 's death is tragic , but the driver did n't see her
