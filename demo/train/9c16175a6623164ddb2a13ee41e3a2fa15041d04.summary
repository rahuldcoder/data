-- two goals in five minutes at the start of extra-time helped defending champions @entity5 book their place in the @entity8 semifinals with a battling 3 - 1 victory over @entity10			1
the game , though , was marred by a controversial third goal by midfielder @entity13 which was allowed to stand by referee @entity14 despite replays showing the ball had clearly not crossed the line			0
by that time the @entity19 ' captain , who was winning a record 170th cap for his country , had already scored an own goal to put the @entity10 ahead after 26 minutes			1
@entity13 scored again at the other end to pull his side level with a powerful long - range strike before half - time which eventually forced the game into an additional 30 minutes in @entity28			2
substitute @entity29 then capitalized on an error from @entity31 to put @entity5 ahead in extra-time , before @entity13 's controversial strike handed them a two - goal cushion			1
to make matters worse for @entity38 's @entity10 , @entity36 was sent off late on as the north africans set up a tantalising last - four clash with old foes @entity41			1
@entity10 took the lead following a spell of intense pressure			2
a succession of @entity48 corners had the @entity50 defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in @entity13 's weak - header on the line dropping into his own net			0
@entity10 pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when @entity13 unleashed a fierce 35 - yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper @entity58 before finding its way in			1
@entity61 could have won the game for @entity5 right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from @entity13 , but the @entity66 forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time			2
however , @entity71 's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3 - 1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals			1
the first came when @entity31 's poor back - pass from the right was intercepted by @entity29 , who and tucked away with ease through the legs of @entity58 two minutes after the resumption			0
the second seems certain to land @entity81 referee @entity14 in the spotlight after @entity13 's free - kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the @entity88 goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground			0
however , it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the @entity10 players			0
it also seemed to knock the stuffing out of @entity97 's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes			0
to add insult to injury , @entity36 was shown a straight red for hauling down last - man @entity103 midway through the second period of extra-time with @entity5 going on to seal a memorable win			2
meanwhile , @entity107 became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating @entity110 in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in @entity112			1
neither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time , but @entity107 progressed 5 - 4 on penalties and will now face near - neighbors @entity118 in the last four on thursday			1
goalkeeper @entity119 scored the decisive penalty for @entity107 after @entity121 had missed for @entity110			0
@entity119 dived to his right to stop @entity121 's penalty after @entity124 and @entity125 and @entity126 had all scored for @entity110			0
@entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130 all scored for @entity107 .			0
