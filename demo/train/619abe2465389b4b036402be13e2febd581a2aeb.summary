-- the tragic death of @entity2 at the hands of the @entity4 -- a fatal scuffle caught in all its horror in a video shot by a bystander -- is , in part , the product of a nationally recognized police strategy , " broken windows			1
" it may have outlived its usefulness in many parts of @entity16			0
@entity2 , a father of six , was allegedly a low - level street hustler , a " buttlegger " illegally selling cigarettes one at a time or in packs without taxes applied			1
when police approached and tried to arrest @entity2 -- something they 'd done before â € ” the man jumped up , complaining that he had no goods on him , had not been dealing and did n't want to be hassled			1
the cops swarmed @entity2 , with at least one appearing to choke @entity2 and press on his neck as he gasped , eight times : " i ca n't breathe			1
" you can see the disturbing video here			0
as the video went viral , community protests and vigils mounted			0
a central issue in the protests is the fact that the video shows one officer , @entity38 grabbing @entity2 by the neck and pressing down on his head and chest , in apparent violation of a police rule that bans such choke holds			1
" members of the @entity4 will not use choke holds , " section 203 - 11 of the @entity46 says			2
" a choke hold shall include , but is not limited to , any pressure to the throat or windpipe , which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air			0
" two of the officers involved in the incident have been assigned to desk duties with their guns taken away			0
@entity4 commissioner @entity60 has promised a " top to bottom " retraining of every member of @entity4 in how to arrest people , as well as a review of the department 's use - of - force policies			1
@entity60 has also met with the @entity68 in anticipation of a possible federal lawsuit alleging that @entity2 's civil rights were violated			1
choke holds were banned 20 years ago after the death of a young man , @entity74 , who was killed in a confrontation with police after a football he was tossing with friends hit a police car			2
the officer who choked @entity74 to death was ultimately sentenced to seven years in prison			0
@entity60 was recently re-appointed to the top post after a long stint in @entity85 , giving the latest incident an eerie deja - vu quality			2
despite the ban on choke holds , new incidents continue to pile up : the @entity4 's @entity91 received more than 1,000 complaints about the use of choke holds between 2009 and 2013 , but punished only nine officers , none of them with anything more serious than a loss of vacation days			2
the rev. @entity100 has vowed to press the @entity4 and mayor @entity101 on the investigation of the @entity2 case , which has been turned over to the local district attorney			1
but the larger question remains : why was a team of six officers enforcing an almost laughably low - level crime like selling loose cigarettes for 50 cents apiece ? the answer lies in @entity16 's dramatically successful experiment with battling an out - of - control crime wave in the early 1990s , much of it built on a " broken windows " theory first developed by criminologists @entity116 and the late @entity117 and laid out in a famous 1982 @entity120 article			1
the idea is shorthand for a phenomenon known to sociologists : leaving an otherwise safe building with an unfixed broken window signals to criminals that nobody cares about the property , which quickly becomes a haven for prostitution , drug dealing and serious crimes			0
with murders back then hitting more than 2,000 per year , @entity4 cops were told by @entity60 to stop waiting for the next 911 call and tasked with enforcing seemingly minor " quality of life " matters like public urination , panhandling and vandalism that made people feel unsafe			1
the strategy provided an immediate payoff			0
cops doing quality - of - life patrols in the subways discovered that people jumping the turnstile ( entering without paying ) often turned out to have drugs , guns or outstanding warrants			2
most turnstile - jumpers were n't dangerous felons , but it turned out that dangerous felons often did n't bother to pay the fare			0
so enforcing small violations helped catch truly dangerous criminals			0
even more important , when streets and subways began to feel safer , more people used them -- and the very presence of more law - abiding citizens always acts as a deterrent to crime ( it creates more witnesses who are likely to point out the bad guys to cops or actually intervene to stop certain kinds of crimes )			0
@entity60 , an architect of the broken windows revolution in policing , appears to be going back to his old playbook during his second tour as commander of the @entity4 : so far this year , officers have arrested 240 subway performers , who do such things as break dance and perform backflips on moving trains			1
but the @entity2 case shows it may be time to revise , reduce or scrap broken windows policing , at least in some neighborhoods			2
when @entity60 became commissioner for the first time , in 1994 , the city had just finished a year with 2,420 murders			2
the number last year was just 333			0
the subways are n't out of control , the break dancers are n't carrying weapons , and low - level cigarette hustlers are n't causing the kind of disorder the city weathered in the 1990s			0
as @entity2 is laid to rest and the cops involved get whatever fate the court system has in store , the @entity4 should re-evaluate how much force and attention it needs to train on low - level crime in a much safer city .			1

@entity206 : death of @entity2 at hands of @entity4 shows old police strategy that does n't work
why such force used on man illegally selling cigarettes ? roots are in @entity60 's first tenure
louis : it 's an approach from ' *80s* . *tackling* " quality of life " crime brought crime rate down
louis : @entity4 must take new look at how crime enforced in a much safer city in 2014
