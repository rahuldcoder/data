a @entity1 jury decided wednesday that @entity2 hired dr. @entity3 , but also concluded that the concert promoter was not liable for @entity6 's drug overdose death			1
the jury decided that @entity3 was competent , so even though @entity2 hired him , it was not liable for @entity6 's death and did n't owe the @entity9 millions of dollars in compensation			1
" i counted @entity6 a creative partner and a friend , " the company 's ceo @entity2 said			1
" we lost one of the world 's greatest musical geniuses , but i am relieved and deeply grateful that the jury recognized that neither i , nor anyone else at @entity2 , played any part in @entity6 's tragic death			1
" the verdict brings the five - month - long trial to a close			0
" we have said from the beginning that this case was a search for the truth			0
@entity2 hired dr. @entity3 , the man who is in jail for killing @entity6 , " according to a statement from family matriarch @entity31 and her lawyers			1
" all options regarding the balance of the jury verdict are being considered			0
" the jury accepted @entity2 lawyers ' arguments that the company was not negligent because its executives had no way of knowing that @entity3 -- licensed to practice in four states and never sued for malpractice -- was a risk to @entity6			1
the singer was a secretive drug addict who kept even his closest relatives in the dark about his use of propofol to sleep , they contended			0
@entity6 's mother and the singer 's three children sued @entity2 in 2010 , arguing that the company 's negligence in hiring , retaining or supervising @entity3 was a factor in the singer 's june 25 , 2009 , death			1
@entity6 died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol , which @entity3 told investigators he was using to treat the singer 's insomnia so he could rest for rehearsals			2
@entity3 is set to be released from jail later this month after serving two years for involuntary manslaughter			0
@entity6 died just days before his comeback tour -- promoted and produced by @entity2 -- was set to debut in @entity69 in the summer of 2009			2
" we felt ( @entity3 ) was competent " to be @entity6 's general practitioner , said juror @entity70			1
" that does n't mean we felt he was ethical			0
" @entity70 said jurors thought the second question -- which said , " was dr. @entity3 unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired ? " -- was confusing and took some time , and several votes , to work out			2
in the end , they voted 10 - 2 to answer " no. " he said one of the key pieces of evidence was the contract between @entity3 and @entity2			2
" the jury 's decision completely vindicates @entity2 , confirming what we have known from the start -- that although @entity6 's death was a terrible tragedy , it was not a tragedy of @entity2 's making , " attorney @entity83 said in a written statement			1
@entity3 's lawyer , @entity95 , let out a gasp when she heard the decision and was visibly shaken			0
because jurors concluded that @entity2 was not liable , they did not consider other questions on the verdict form that would have determined how much in damages the promoter would have paid @entity31 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
@entity6 lead lawyer @entity106 suggested a range between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion to replace the earnings lost by @entity6 's death at age 50 and the non-economic -- or personal -- damages from the loss of a father and son			1
the damage award , however , would have been reduced by the percentage of blame jurors decided @entity6 shared in his death			0
the @entity121 lawyer suggested in closing arguments that they assign 20 % of the liability to @entity6			0
@entity2 's lawyers had contended @entity6 chose @entity3 , who had treated him for three years as a family physician , but @entity6 lawyers had argued the promoters chose to negotiate their own contract with the doctor so they could control him			2
the case is unlikely to end with the jury 's verdict because @entity6 lawyers have said they have grounds for an appeal , which could take years to decide			0
jurors appeared engaged and entertained during the 21 - week trial that included dramatic testimony by @entity6 's mother , son and former wife .			2
