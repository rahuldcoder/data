@entity0 and i were all ready to have our first bike ride			1
we had a baby sitter for our daughter @entity6 and we were really making it happen -- no more talk			1
it would be a real 100 % couples ' bike ride			1
our first ride as a married couple , with our own bikes			1
i was convinced that with my new @entity17 bike it would be a cake walk to do this , and would n't be a struggle at all			1
the day was beautiful -- not a cloud in the sky			1
i felt as if i were an expert bike rider , from my school days ; however , that was a long time ago			1
i was in for a surprise			2
i had never been clipped into a bike before			2
also , i never had a bike before that did not have a kick stand			2
this was no ordinary @entity31			2
being clipped in full gear , i was ready to do this , or so i thought			2
i clipped in and was on the bike for an entire 20 seconds			2
i had this down , i thought to myself			2
then , i tried to stop and get off			0
i panicked , because i could not get my feet off			0
it all seemed to happen in vivid slow motion			0
i crashed and i could not do anything to stop it			0
i went down like the @entity42 , and it was an ugly sight			0
it was also a real crushing blow to my athlete 's ego			1
so , i started asking myself all of these questions in this blink of any eye as i laid on the ground with my new bike , where i was now stuck like a beached whale			0
how could i fall so quickly ? why could i not get my feet off the pedals ? was i too old and out of shape to really do this @entity57 challenge ? and perhaps more importantly , are people who do triathlons absolutely nuts ? in a matter of one minute , i doubted every athletic ability i once was so confident about			1
to succeed , i knew that i had to mentally slap myself and tell myself , ' hey , you can do this			0
' it was only at that very moment that i realized , this was my own journey against myself			0
i kicked my feet out of the pedals , picked up the bike and rode for around 10 miles with no more falls for the day			0
i think i learned an important lesson , crashing 20 seconds into my first ride			0
conquering a @entity74 , is not going to be without failure and falling down			0
it 's about getting up , and not giving up			1
it 's about listening and becoming connected to your body , and realizing that training for a triathlon is a spiritual journey as well as physical one			1
i may have crashed on my bike faster than anyone in the entire history of @entity57 , but the lesson i learned in the process was well worth it			1
if and when you go down on the bike , you have to pick yourself up , and get it together			0
you totally got this ! ! !			0

@entity0 and @entity95 are @entity57 's first team couple
@entity98 says he wants them both to get in better shape
couple wants to be better role models for their daughter , @entity6 , 3
