@entity0 -- in an interview with congressional investigators , a former top diplomat in @entity3 expressed concern that more could have been done by the military on september 11 - 12 last year to protect those being attacked at the @entity10 compound and annex in @entity12 , @entity3			1
specifically , @entity13 wondered why the military did not send a plane into @entity3 airspace as a show of force , and why four @entity10 special operations soldiers were not permitted to travel to @entity12 on a @entity3 plane the morning of september 12			1
the @entity20 will hear from @entity13 and others in a wednesday hearing on the @entity12 tragedy , which ended in the deaths of four @entity10 -- @entity10 ambassador @entity25 , information officer @entity26 , and former @entity28 @entity27 and @entity29			1
the committee 's chairman , rep. @entity36 , told @entity1 monday that @entity13 , who was the @entity10 deputy chief of mission in @entity3 at the time of the attack , " is going to testify that from the get - go , he knew this was a terrorist attack and communicated that to the @entity32 , to the @entity33 , to anyone that would listen before , during , and after			1
" @entity36 asserted that the @entity47 administration 's " talking points " afterward -- specifically the statements by the @entity10 ambassador to the @entity50 , @entity51 , which did not acknowledge that it was a terrorist attack , " had an effect on our diplomatic relations " with @entity3 and " was an unnecessary error			1
" he said he wants to know " who made the decision to change the talking points in a way that caused the @entity10 people to be lied to			1
" @entity36 denied that the hearing is a @entity61 effort to discredit a @entity63 administration , and asked , " why are n't the @entity63 just as upset that we did n't do all we could do to save @entity10 lives ? " beyond the @entity12 attack , he said , he expects the hearing to shed light on a failing war on terror , one in which @entity71 is erupting , one in which @entity74 is erupting , one in which @entity77 is the result of terrorists , of @entity82 extreme groups , and i think that 's the message the @entity10 people want to hear is , tell us the truth , do what it takes to have us be protected , do n't tell us things are n't terrorist attacks when they are			1
" @entity13 spoke to investigators on april 11 of this year , and excerpts of transcripts of the interview were obtained by @entity1			1
" the @entity3 that i talked to , and the @entity3 and other @entity10 who were involved in the war have told me also , that @entity3 revolutionaries were very cognizant of the impact that @entity10 and @entity99 airpower had with respect to their victory , " @entity13 said			1
" they are under no illusions that @entity10 and @entity99 airpower won that war for them			2
and so , in my personal opinion , a fast mover flying over @entity12 at some point , you know , as soon as possible might very well have prevented some of the bad things that happened that night			2
" @entity13 went on to say he believes " if we had been able to scramble a fighter or aircraft or two over @entity12 as quickly as possible after the attack commenced " -- around 9:30 that night -- " i believe there would not have been a mortar attack on the annex in the morning because i believe the @entity3 would have split			1
they would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them			0
" the former deputy chief of mission suggested that the @entity3 government would have granted the @entity10 permission to fly the planes			1
" i believe that the @entity3 were hoping that we were going to come bail them out of this mess , " @entity13 said			1
" and , you know , they were as surprised as we were that ... the military forces that did arrive only arrived on the evening of september 12th			0
" rep. @entity132 , @entity133 , a member of the committee , tells @entity1 that " military personnel were ready willing and able , and within proximity , but the @entity137 told them they had no authority and to stand down			0
" @entity36 added that the personnel " may not have arrived in time to save lives , but at the time the decision was made , the decision was wrong			0
" in february , the @entity144 chairman , gen. @entity143 , was asked by sen. @entity145 , @entity146 , why f - 16s at @entity148 in @entity149 were n't deployed to @entity12 that night			1
" this is the middle of the night now , these are not aircraft on strip alert , " @entity143 said			0
" they 're there as part of our commitment to @entity99 and @entity159			0
and so , as we looked at the time line , it was pretty clear that it would take up to 20 hours or so to get them there			0
secondly , senator , importantly , it was the wrong tool for the job			0
" then - secretary of defense @entity169 testified that " unfortunately , there was no specific intelligence or indications of an imminent attack on @entity10 facilities in @entity12			1
and frankly , without an adequate warning , there was not enough time given the speed of the attack for armed military assets to respond			0
" that 's not just my view or @entity143 's view			0
it was the view of the @entity187 that studied what happened on that day , " he added			0
" this is not 9/11 , " @entity169 said in a february interview on @entity1 's " @entity190			0
" " you can not just simply call and expect within two minutes to have a team in place			0
that 's the nature of it			0
our people are there , they 're in position to move , but we 've got to have good intelligence that gives us a heads up that something 's going to happen			0
" @entity13 said that around 10 p.m. on the night of the first attack , he was at the @entity206 in @entity207 talking to @entity33 officials in @entity0 , regional security officer @entity209 at the @entity10 embassy , defense attache lt. col. @entity211 and others			1
@entity211 was reaching out to officials with the @entity3 @entity214 and to the chief of staff of the @entity216 , as well as officials with the @entity144 and the @entity218			1
@entity13 recalled asking @entity211 , " is there anything coming ? " he said @entity211 replied " that the nearest fighter planes were @entity222 , that he had been told that it would take two to three hours to get them airborne , but that there were no tanker assets near enough to support a flight from @entity222			1
" there was one team that headed from @entity207 to @entity12 , arriving at around 1:15 a.m. , @entity13 said			1
@entity211 , @entity13 recalled , " worked assiduously all night long to try to get the @entity3 military to respond in some way			1
" the @entity3 prime minister called @entity13 and told him that the @entity10 ambassador had been killed , after which " the @entity3 military agreed to fly their c - 130 to @entity12 and carry additional personnel to @entity12 as reinforcements			1
" @entity13 said that four @entity240 troops in @entity207 -- led by the leader of the @entity10 @entity242 , @entity238 -- planned to hitch a ride on the @entity3 plan to travel to @entity12 to help			1
" we fully intended for those guys to go , because we had already essentially stripped ourselves of our security presence , or our security capability , to the bare minimum , " @entity13 recalled			2
but the four were informed by someone with @entity252 that they did n't have the authority to go , @entity13 said			2
" so lt. col. @entity256 , who is the @entity238 commander , his team , you know , they were on their way to the vehicles to go to the airport to get on the @entity234 when he got a phone call from @entity238 which said , ' you ca n't go now , you do n't have authority to go now , '' @entity13 said			2
" and so they missed the flight			0
" " they were told not to board the flight , so they missed it , " @entity13 said			2
" i still remember col. @entity256 , he said , ' i have never been so embarrassed in my life that a @entity33 officer has bigger balls than somebody in the military			0
" the @entity234 left between 6 and 6:30 a.m. , so the four special forces troops would not have arrived in time to fend off the 5:15 a.m. attack on the @entity278 annex in @entity12			2
@entity13 said he recalled asking @entity211 again if any military help was coming			2
" the answer , again , was the same as before			0
it 's too far away , there are no tankers			0
... there is nothing that could respond			0
... " i guess they just did n't have the right authority from the right level , " @entity13 recalled			2
@entity169 , in his february testimony defending officials ' actions , said , " the bottom line is this , that we were not dealing with a prolonged or continuous assault , which could have been brought to an end by a @entity10 military response , very simply , although we had forces deployed to the region			2
time , distance , the lack of an adequate warning , events that moved very quickly on the ground prevented a more immediate response			0
" despite the uncertainty at the time , the @entity137 and the rest of the @entity10 government spared no effort to do everything we could to try to save @entity10 lives			2
before , during and after the attack , every request the @entity137 received we did , we accomplished			0
