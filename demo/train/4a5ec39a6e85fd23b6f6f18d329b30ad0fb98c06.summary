@entity0 -- as absentee ballots pour in from @entity5 troops overseas , officials are voicing concerns that many of those votes wo n't be counted			1
an absentee ballot from @entity10 in @entity11 shows the names of the general election candidates			2
" it 's dismal , " said @entity14 , who works for the @entity15 , a non-partisan group			0
" these are the voters that are in some cases preserving our liberties and out there with their lives on the line			0
" @entity14 estimates that in the last general election , only about 30 percent of overseas military ballots were actually returned and counted			1
" it 's disenfranchising our military and frankly i think it 's very unpatriotic , " said retired @entity28 lt. @entity27			2
a part of the problem is that each state has its own rules for absentee voting , and those rules can change in the middle of an election season			1
in @entity11 , for example , the federal write - in ballot required a witness ' signature and address			0
that proved confusing for soldiers overseas because there was no box provided for a witness address			2
@entity50 , the @entity51 registrar , initially said he would have to discard 63 votes because voters neglected to provide a witness address			0
" these ballots that are n't being met -- i ca n't accept as valid ballots at this point			0
if the law changes , i welcome a review of the law			0
i think the law is horrible , " he said			0
late monday , @entity11 's attorney general agreed , saying all county registrars could ignore that part of the law			1
other areas , like @entity10 , refused to disqualify the absentee ballots that were filled out improperly , contributing to the the ag 's decision to intervene			1
another part of the problem is that delivering mail from a battlefield can be challenging , according to rep. @entity76			0
@entity76 , @entity77 , says absentee ballots mailed from war zones are not getting to county registrars fast enough to be legally counted			1
" with all the modernization that we have , we should be able to move these ballots , track them at the same time , bring the modernization and technology we have today to make sure our heroes across this world get treated fairly , " he said			2
@entity76 said he is pushing a bill through @entity89 that would address these issues , but not in time for this election			2
overseas absentee ballots were at the center of the @entity95 recount during the 2000 presidential election between @entity97 and @entity98			1
@entity97 aides and @entity101 surrogates blasted their @entity103 rivals for having overseas absentee ballots disqualified in @entity95 counties , many for lack of postmarks			1
many of those ballots were presumed to have been from service members supporting @entity97			0
@entity111 , the @entity103 vice presidential candidate , denied that charge and said that the disputed votes deserve the " benefit of doubt			0
" " [ @entity98 ] and i would never authorize and would not tolerate a campaign that was aimed specifically at invalidating ballots from members of our armed services , and i 've been assured that there were more absentee ballots from non-military voters that were ultimately disqualified , " he said during an interview on @entity118 's " @entity117			1
" more than a month after the election , the @entity95 @entity127 upheld two state court rulings that cleared the way to count thousands of ballots in predominantly @entity133 and @entity134 counties .			1
