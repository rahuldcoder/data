-- " hey batter , hey batter , batter -- swing ! " that 's the chant my grade - school girlfriends and i would scream from the wooden bleachers at all the neighborhood @entity8 games			1
for maximum impact it was crucial to scream " swing ! " at the precise moment the ball crossed the plate			0
the goal was to intimidate batters to blindly swing and miss. our chants were loudest when my little brother , @entity20 , was on the pitching mound			0
he was a scrawny kid but he was a lefty so his coach sometimes let him pitch			0
@entity20 was n't easy to hit off of and if he could strike out a few batters , we knew our neighborhood reps were safe for another day			2
so my girls and i cheered like our lives depended on it			0
but honestly , many of us wanted to be more than " bleacher creatures			0
" we wanted a piece of the action			0
@entity8 back then had a strict no - girls - allowed policy			1
my brother could dream of being @entity37 first baseman @entity36 and playing for his beloved @entity38			2
we had to be happy as the rowdy pep squad			0
and the unfairness of this rule did n't slip by us			2
especially because many of us girls held our own , and better , against the neighborhood boys during our co-ed games of sandlot stick ball , baseball , football and just about every other sport			2
still , none of us or our families challenged this discriminatory rule			0
that 's just the way things were back then			2
so i could n't help but feel not only joyful but a sense of redemption as i watched @entity8 phenom @entity58 light up the field and shut down batters with her beautiful shutout on august 15th , in the opening game for her @entity65 @entity8 team			1
her feat was a first for a girl playing @entity8			1
at 13 years old , @entity58 is sweet revenge for all of us not - so - young - now sisters who ever wished we could grace the @entity8 field or imagined making it to the @entity75			1
and while all eyes were on @entity77 -- primarily because her games were broadcast on @entity80 -- thousands of other girls across the nation play @entity8 today			1
it was 1974 , in the thick of the @entity83 , that @entity8 softball for girls was created , and the baseball rules and regulations all of @entity8 were made non-gender - specific			1
two years earlier , @entity88 of the @entity89 had been signed into law by @entity91			0
the education law gave women greater opportunities to receive scholarships and funding for college athletics			0
but @entity88 has been challenged for decades and gender discrimination in sports remains a continuous battle			2
it 's thanks to courageous young athletes like @entity77 and the coaches who recognize their potential who are breaking down gender stereotypes			1
and in @entity8 , girls are finally making their mark			1
" i started recruiting girls my first year as a coach in 1992 , " said @entity109 , who has been involved with @entity8 in @entity110 , @entity111 , for the past 23 years			1
" my first year , i was short about five players			2
so i knocked on doors and asked parents if their kids wanted to play			2
if girls want to play , they should be allowed to play			1
i 've had girls on most of my teams , and women on my coaching staffs and we 've won , " said @entity109			0
it has n't been easy to persuade girls to try out for baseball , he said			1
most girls choose softball and many parents still steer their kids into traditional gender activities			2
@entity109 said : " when i ask parents about letting their girls play i usually get , " oh no , she 's a dancer , " or a cheerleader			1
" his daughters not only all played baseball , but were wrestlers as well			2
are your children redefining gender roles ? share your story with @entity143 @entity109 thinks @entity145 success is a game changer			1
" her appearance absolutely changes things for girls			0
it shows the world that girls can play baseball at the @entity8 level			1
it will bring more girls into the game			2
" last night , @entity160 won the @entity161			0
@entity77 's @entity65 team fell out of contention when it lost to a team from @entity165 last week			1
but @entity167 's star shines on			0
@entity169 marketers are eager to turn her into a commodity immediately , even if it puts her hopes of playing sports in college in jeopardy			1
the experts are hedging bets on how much money the eighth - grader can earn in endorsement deals			0
" what 's she worth today , $ 500,000 , $ 100,000 ? " the experts ask			0
a baseball she signed in the afterglow of her perfect game fetched a shocking $ 510 on @entity188			1
can she be packaged into " @entity190 's @entity189 " ? can she help sell the next cool gadget to kids across the country ? hungry for a happy story , the television networks are all clamoring to interview @entity58			1
i 'm hoping she and her family wo n't get sucked into the hype			0
the limelight is a cruel stage , especially for children			0
and something is wrong when the world is pressuring a 13 - year - old to cash in quick just because she 's earned a little respect and tv time for playing a sport she loves			1
my bet is @entity58 is just getting started			1
a girl with her determination and talent is destined to do far greater things with her life than throw a pitch over the plate at 70 mph			0
let 's step back , give her room to soar and see what she can really accomplish			0
luckily , her parents seem to be thinking clearly			0
" at the end of the day , she has a dream to play [ basketball ] for @entity228 , so we 're not taking anything until we 're clear on that , because her dream is her dream , " @entity223 , @entity58 ' stepfather , told the @entity224 recently			1
" that 's her decision			0
... none of us would like to ruin that dream			0
" @entity77 does n't need a slick marketing campaign to tell the world she 's a role model			1
she 's already changed lives and planted seeds of hope for millions of young girls around the world			0
simply by having the courage to step onto that mound , dominate her competitors , and , yes , even handle defeat with class , @entity58 has inspired more young girls than we 'll ever know -- and even a few big girls like me .			2

13 - year - old phenom pitcher @entity58 ' shutout a first for a girl playing @entity8
@entity259 : mo'ne a joy for all @entity261 who were n't allowed to play
@entity264 : @entity77 is game changer in breaking down gender stereotypes in baseball
