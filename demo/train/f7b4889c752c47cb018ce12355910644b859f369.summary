@entity0 -- think of pop - tops , and a soda can might come to mind			0
but sister @entity5 sees pop - tops as a way to help hundreds of women in @entity9 , @entity10 , start a new life			1
@entity5 sells women 's purses made out of the aluminum tabs , and so far she has sold more than 500 purses for about $ 3,000			1
all of the proceeds go to the people who made them -- her students at the @entity21 's @entity20			1
eight years ago , @entity5 started the school in @entity9 to help poor young girls and women caught in the middle of the decades - long @entity10 civil war			1
many of the women had become mothers after they were abducted and raped by rebels in the @entity31			1
@entity5 's school feeds and rehabilitates more than 300 mothers and their babies each year			1
it also provides free medical care and teaches the mothers valuable life skills , such as sewing , cooking and cleaning			0
the purses are a relatively new endeavor and just one of the many ways her school is helping students who have been deeply traumatized and need money to support themselves			1
" i got this idea , and it took me about two weeks to teach myself and my students , " @entity5 said during a recent trip to the @entity49 " it 's really changing their lives , because they are paid for what they produce			1
" in 2007 , @entity5 was recognized as a @entity58 for her efforts with the school			1
" it raised a lot of awareness about what we 're doing , because after that , it exposed me to many people in the world , " she said			0
" it has really made a lot of people come to understand the importance of supporting us			0
" however , the needs are still many			0
for example , there is no electricity at the school			2
" we have a generator which we can use for about two hours , but the cost of fuel is so high that we can not maintain it , " she said			0
" @entity10 is a country which is developing , and technology is available			2
but in my case , i live in a place where there 's no electricity			2
" the school is also next to a prison , but @entity5 said she saw that as an opportunity , not an obstacle			1
she said that as she drove by one day , she knew that inside there were people she could help			0
" i went to the prison authority and asked them if they would let the women come out , and they told me to put it in writing			2
i did , and now the children are coming to our center from the prison , " she said			0
@entity5 , who joined the sisterhood when she was just 15 , says that since being named a @entity58 , she has seen a marked increase in publicity , awareness and trust			1
doctors , lawyers and professional athletes from the @entity49 now routinely travel to her school			2
but she gets her most satisfaction from seeing " these girls working with their heads up			0
they have their dignity restored , and they can support themselves and they can take care of their children			0
and they love their children			0
" at 54 , @entity5 is not planning to slow down anytime soon			2
a second school north of @entity9 and close to the border with @entity129 is now being built			1
" i think i see everything as a kind of plan of @entity134 for me , and it gives me the energy , it gives me the joy to be where i am and to work in a difficult situation , " she said			0
" and i think if i was someone always unhappy or ... i was not giving joy to the people , i would not accept to take care of these girls who have suffered a lot			0
" she then paused before adding determinedly , " yes , i will continue			0
" donations for @entity5 's school can be made through the @entity147 .			1

sister @entity149 , a 2007 @entity58 , is still making a difference in @entity10
her school is rehabilitating women who were abducted and raped during a long civil war
one way the students make money is by the sales of women 's purses they make
@entity5 says a second school is now being built close to the @entity129 border
