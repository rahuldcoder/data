-- november 30 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : glad to see you 've tuned back in to @entity0 ! my name is @entity18			2
we are broadcasting from the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 ! today 's first story has to do with information that was never meant to be seen by the public			1
first up : @entity26 @entity27 : it was leaked			1
like a book of @entity31 secrets shared with everyone , all over the internet			2
the organization that 's publishing this information is called " @entity26			1
" this is an international , not - for - profit website that posts material , often secret material , that it gets from anonymous sources			1
they believe the public has a right to know what their leaders are saying			2
what @entity26 is publishing this time around are hundreds of thousands of documents -- communications between @entity50 and @entity31 embassies around the world			1
they contain classified -- secret -- information about @entity31 diplomacy : how @entity31 government officials interacted with -- and in some cases felt about -- the government officials of other countries			1
so why does any of this matter ? well , @entity31 secretary of state @entity62 , whose interactions with other officials are included in some of these documents , calls their publication illegal			1
and she says it could threaten @entity31 national security and put lives in danger			2
plus , it 's embarrassing			1
and it could cause other countries to doubt @entity31 's ability to keep secrets			1
@entity76 delves into the content and criticism surrounding the leaks			2
( begin video ) @entity76 , @entity0 @entity81 : the @entity31 government has been in damage control all weekend long			2
secretary of state @entity62 personally phoning the leaders of eight different countries : @entity87 , @entity88 , the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 ; assessing the potential impact on relations			1
the government has been roundly condemning the leaks			0
there are 250,000 of them , and not all are out at this point			0
they are on a wide variety of subjects , and some of the most interesting ones deal with the reaction of @entity108 countries , a critical reaction toward @entity109 and its nuclear program			0
also , " the @entity111 " reporting that @entity113 personnel in some cases were asked to provide information from foreign diplomats about things like frequent flyer numbers and credit card numbers			1
@entity122 , the spokesperson for the @entity113 , saying in a tweet , our diplomats are that , they are diplomats , they collect information			1
they are not , as he put it , intelligence assets			0
now , what could be the potential damage ? well , one @entity31 official telling me it could be hugely damaging to the @entity31 , but some of that will depend on what other governments , governments around the world , will be saying			0
and i have been speaking with some embassies here in @entity50			0
they are saying that they are still studying the documents , and we can certainly expect a lot more			1
( @entity141 ) @entity142 ? @entity27 : @entity31 government workers , like @entity62 , president @entity144 , @entity146 employees and park rangers , may not be getting a pay raise for the next two years			0
that 's a proposal from the president himself who says this is about getting the government deficit under control and that the sacrifices made would have to be shared with government employees			1
the government 's deficits -- how much more money it spends , than it takes in -- are expected to exceed nine trillion dollars over the next decade			1
so how much would freezing government wages save ? about 60 billion over the next ten years			0
not a significant amount of money when compared to the overall deficit			0
but one analyst called the proposal a " psychological first step			0
" it 's also not set in stone ; @entity170 would have to approve this before it could take effect			1
back in session @entity27 : and that is one of the many things the lame duck @entity170 started considering as lawmakers got back to work yesterday			0
one major decision they 're facing this week : the federal budget -- what to spend where , in order to keep the government operating			0
some other things they 'll have until year 's end to decide : will the government keep taxes the way they were after president @entity192 cut them ? will the government extend benefits to people who 've been without jobs ? and it will be interesting to see what sort of compromises are in the december air because things are changing in january : the new @entity202 will be controlled by @entity203 , while @entity204 will maintain a slim lead in the @entity206			2
@entity207 @entity0 student news : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity211 's 6th grade classes at @entity212 in @entity213 , @entity214 ! which of these countries borders @entity4 to the north ? is it : a ) @entity93 , b ) @entity219 , c ) @entity221 or @entity222 ) @entity223 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity93 shares most of @entity4 's northern border			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity229 @entity27 : @entity93 is also @entity4 's closest ally , which is why @entity93 factors in to the crisis on the @entity229			1
it 's calling for an emergency meeting of six countries , to discuss the best ways to ease tensions in the @entity229 region			1
but the @entity31 , one of those six countries , says a meeting is no substitute for @entity4 changing its behavior			1
@entity4 is furious over military exercises being done by @entity242 ; in response , @entity4 attacked a @entity229 island last week			1
@entity242 says if the north attacks again , it will respond firmly			1
on sunday , the @entity31 joined @entity242 's military exercises in the @entity247			1
@entity248 @entity27 : there are 194 countries represented right now in @entity5 , @entity6 for the latest @entity252 @entity251			0
they 're hoping for an international agreement on reducing carbon emissions			0
these are released into the air when we burn gas , oil or coal			0
and many scientists blame carbon emissions for affecting the @entity265 's climate , though others say humans have little or no effect on the climate			2
hard to say if there 'll be any breakthroughs at the summit			0
not much came out of last year 's meeting in @entity274 , @entity275			1
and part of the reason for that : different carbon limits are suggested for different countries , and not everyone agrees on what those limits should be			0
is this legit ? @entity0 student news : is this legit ? to live in the @entity31 legally , you must be a @entity31 citizen			2
not legit ! the @entity31 government offers people ways to legally work and live in the @entity31 without being citizens			0
@entity289 @entity27 : but those who are in the @entity31 illegally may face deportation : being sent back to their home countries			1
an interesting sticking point in the debate over illegal immigrants , is this : what happens to their children ? not those who were born on @entity31 soil ; they 're citizens			0
but those who were brought here as kids : should they be allowed to stay ? @entity305 illustrates why there 's so much disagreement over this question			2
( begin video ) @entity305 , @entity0 national correspondent : for 19 - year - old @entity310 , @entity31 is home			0
her parents moved to @entity312 from @entity242 when she was eight			1
@entity313 , college student : my first memory was when i first came here and my dad took me on a ferry here near where the @entity321 is , and we went around			0
and it was snowing that day so it was extra beautiful			0
@entity324 : it was 1999			0
the @entity326 is seen over her shoulder			0
but from the time she was little , she was told to keep a secret			2
her family was in the @entity31 illegally			0
the college honor student is now fighting deportation			0
her status is tied to her divorced father , who 's had no contact with @entity310 and her mom since moving back to @entity242 years ago			1
her only hope is the @entity289			1
tossed around like a football in @entity170 for a decade , it would allow students such as @entity310 to become permanent residents if they came to the @entity31 as a child , attend college or serve in the military and are of good character			2
@entity310 's undocumented status prevented her from getting into @entity350 schools but she 's attending a state university on scholarship			2
@entity353 : i 'm still working on a career that i want , to go into medicine			0
@entity324 : @entity289 opponents are urging defeat in a lame duck @entity170			1
@entity360 , @entity361 : illegal immigrants are n't supposed to be rewarded with citizenship , voting rights and college educations and financial aid paid for by me and my family and my grandparents			0
illegal immigrants are supposed to return home			0
