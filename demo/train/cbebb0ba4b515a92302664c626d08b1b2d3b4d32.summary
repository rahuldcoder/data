-- not so much the @entity1 , more the @entity2			0
from the get go , @entity4 struggled in getting to grips with the task of managing @entity8 and less than a year after succeeding the legendary @entity9 , the @entity3 has been sacked just 10 months into a six - year contract			1
it 's an old adage that @entity12 was n't built in a day -- but it did burn in seven nights			0
with that in mind , here are the big mistakes made by @entity4 during his turbulent @entity19 tenure with the club now left fighting all sorts of fires both off and on the pitch			1
@entity24 less the elephant in the room , more the uncomfortable , luxuriously - haired disaster in the @entity8 midfield			2
the @entity30 international followed @entity4 to @entity31 from @entity32 in september 2013 and he signaled the new manager 's first foray into the transfer market			1
it smacked of a toddler reaching for its comfort blanket			0
@entity24 's Â£ 27.5 million price tag always looked on the large side and it has only inflated with each of his underwhelming performances			0
the nadir of the 27 - year - old 's debut campaign at @entity19 arrived earlier this month , during an abject showing in a @entity49 tie against @entity50			1
@entity52 newspaper as was so unimpressed with @entity24 's showing in the 1 - 1 draw that it refused to give him a mark in the player ratings section of its match report			0
with a new manager likely to arrive with fresh ideas , it could be a matter of time before @entity24 follows @entity4 out of the door			1
local laughing stock united fans hate losing to @entity66			0
and they despise defeat to @entity68			0
losing to one of those two teams is unacceptable , losing to both twice in the same season was previously unthinkable			0
somehow @entity4 ' team managed the unthinkable as the @entity3 presided over four defeats in four matches against @entity8 's two fiercest rivals , with an aggregate score of 11 - 1			1
even worse , @entity68 , the club @entity9 successfully knocked off their " f * * * ing perch , " look set to win a first league title in 24 years , while @entity8 have failed to qualify for the @entity49 for the first time since 1995			1
as for @entity66 , once referred to by @entity9 as @entity8 's " noisy neighbors , " the blue half of @entity31 is currently 17 points ahead of the red half after also winning the @entity86 final			1
last season @entity9 's team wrapped up a 20th league title for the club , finishing 11 points clear of @entity66 in second place			1
under @entity4 , @entity8 never looked like troubling the top of the table			1
so no surprise then that the joke doing the rounds on tuesday after @entity4 ' dismissal was that police had been called to @entity19 to stop @entity68 and @entity66 fans protesting over his sacking			2
tactics ? what tactics ? ! easy and straightforward to defend against			0
that was how @entity104 , who had lost eight of their previous 11 @entity108 games prior to a 2 - 2 draw against @entity8 in february , described the tactics employed by @entity4			1
after the match , @entity8 were damned by statistics			2
@entity4 ' men flung 81 crosses into the @entity104 penalty area , evidence -- his critics suggested -- that the @entity8 manager was a tactical neanderthal			1
after watching @entity9 's team tear into the opposition for over two decades , fans found this " back to basics " brand of football hard to stomach			2
@entity4 ' reported focus on fitness and conditioning in training also backfired			2
rather than looking energetic on the pitch , @entity8 too often resembled the battery - powered bunny beaten to the line by its @entity135 - fueled rival			2
other brands of battery are available			0
problem players @entity4 inherited a squad which had just won the @entity108 title at a canter , but he struggled to get the best out of stars like @entity145			2
tying @entity145 down to a new five - and - a - half year deal in february , rumored to be worth an eye - watering $ 500,000 per week , was seen as something of a coup by the club			2
but the truth is that @entity145 has rarely looked worthy of such a lavish investment			0
the 28 - year - old may have scored 15 @entity108 goals this season , but too often he has put in displays well below his dazzling best			0
the signing of @entity158 from @entity159 was supposed to add flair and purpose to @entity8 's attack , but the @entity163 has only shown flashes of his undoubted talent since arriving in january			2
people joked that giving @entity4 the present of @entity158 was like giving your granddad an @entity170 for @entity171			2
@entity4 ' failure to coax the best out of these players , and gifted technicians like @entity176 , further contributed to his demise			0
small - club mentality " i did n't get the chance to say yes or no , " @entity4 said in july			1
" as you can imagine , the blood drained from my face			0
" he might sound like someone describing death by lethal injection , but this is the tale of how the @entity3 became @entity8 manager			1
" it was a strange situation , " he added			0
" i had no idea whatsoever until sir @entity9 gave me a call and asked me to come to his house			0
" i was expecting him to say , ' i 'm going to take one of your players ' or something else			0
i went in and the first thing he said to me was , ' i 'm retiring '			0
" i said , ' when ? ' because he was never retiring , and he said , ' next week ! ' his next words were , ' you 're the next @entity8 manager '			1
" the sad truth is that @entity4 never chose to be the @entity8 manager and , at times , he resembled a rabbit caught in a car 's headlights			1
while 11 years at @entity32 earned him the respect of the football fraternity , @entity4 never seemed to come to terms with the scale of his new role			1
" i do n't know what we have to do to win , " @entity4 said after a defeat to @entity211 in february			1
a quote which unintentionally encapsulates his troubled reign .			0
