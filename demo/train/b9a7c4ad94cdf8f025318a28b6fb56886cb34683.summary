-- as the world celebrates the long - awaited addition to the @entity5 royal family , it is worth taking some time to reflect on the women around the world for whom childbirth is not such a joyous , beautiful and celebrated occasion			1
every year in @entity12 , 162,000 mothers die needlessly because of complications during pregnancy and childbirth			1
that figure represents a staggering 56 % of the global total			0
for an @entity25 woman , one of the most natural of events in a woman 's life -- giving birth -- is also one of the most dangerous			1
as a result , each year close to 1 million @entity25 children are left motherless			1
many of these deaths are avoidable , but not enough is being done to prevent them			0
since the turn of the last century , maternal mortality rates worldwide have been in decline but remain high in developing countries , including many @entity25 nations			1
for these maternal death rates to improve in @entity12 , governments and international institutions must recognize and introduce policies that tackle the challenges faced by @entity25 women in accessing effective reproductive healthcare			1
read this : starting a revolution for teen mothers whilst @entity12 has seen a decrease in maternal mortality rates over the past 20 years , there is still a long way to go if the region is to meet its @entity50			1
this is largely due to a failure to address political , socio - cultural and financial challenges			0
there has been slow progress in meeting the 2001 @entity56 , in which countries pledged to assign 15 % of their national budgets towards healthcare			0
this is compounded by deficits within the health ministries for numerous countries resulting in inadequate funding for maternal services			0
run down resources with limited investment in health resources , many women in @entity12 can not access an adequate healthcare unit during pregnancy and childbirth			1
many can not access one at all , and countless women are forced to walk miles to their nearest health center			1
without transportation most women give birth at home or on the way to hospital , a journey on which too many will suffer fatal complications			1
for women in many rural communities , the norm is for a traditional birth attendant ( @entity89 ) to assist the delivery instead of making the trip			1
@entity92 often have no formal training and deliver without sterilized equipment , if any , causing yet more risks for mother and baby			0
read this : ' @entity25 women a voice ' however , even if a woman does make it to a hospital , she is likely to find herself in one so under - resourced that soon - to - be mothers have to sleep on the floor following delivery because beds are in such short supply			1
women often have to arrive armed with basic resources such as paraffin to light lamps in the event that they go into labor at night			1
without paraffin and power , midwives such as @entity121 's @entity120 , who is also the face of the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) 's stand up for @entity126 global campaign , have to conduct deliveries using the light from their mobile phones and plastic bags over their hands as gloves			0
" there is so much work to do " @entity120 's health center is located in the @entity137 district in rural @entity121 and serves a community of 37,000 people			0
she works tirelessly round the clock to assist mothers in deliveries , as well as trying to offer antenatal and postnatal care			2
but coping with the demand is tough			0
she says there are occasions when she must travel long distances to reach mothers - to - be who can not reach a health center -- sometimes arriving after they have given birth			2
her own health center has just two midwives			0
" there is so much work to do and yet there are only a few of us			0
we are forced to work day and night , " she says			2
read this : @entity25 midwife , @entity161 ? and @entity120 's story is sadly not unique			1
many health units are overstretched			0
with no doctors and few qualified midwives , most hospitals and health units can not accommodate the women that do manage to reach a healthcare facility			2
low pay and difficult working conditions lead to frustration within the existing workforce , which in turn leads to mismanagement of patients			0
women testify that they are mistreated in hospitals and this is just one more reality that encourages them to give birth at home			1
lack of information for the majority of @entity186 mums - to - be , the months leading up to the big day are full of scheduled antenatal appointments , classes and ultrasounds			2
the nine months of waiting and expecting are crammed full of information on how best to care for the growing life			2
pregnancy and childbirth becomes the hot topic of discussion			2
and , it does n't end when the baby arrives ; postnatal care is a core part of midwives ' duties in the @entity202			2
for many women in @entity12 , an astounding lack of information means they simply do not see or understand the reasons for attending antenatal and postnatal health services , let alone see the value added by giving birth at a health center			1
moreover , the absence of information has hampered initiatives designed to prevent mother - to - child infections , as well as immunization			0
read this : flying doctor takes to the skies it 's for all these reasons that @entity123 launched its @entity221 , which aims to train 15,000 midwives by 2015 because , as @entity123 asserts , midwives save lives			0
increasing the number of trained midwives will mean more than seven million mothers annually will be cared for and informed , which means many more children will be raised in the arms of their mothers			0
the joyful birth of the @entity233 and @entity233 of @entity235 's baby is a wondrous occasion , an everyday miracle that deserves to be commemorated and honored			0
but whilst we celebrate the arrival of a royal newborn , perhaps we should also spare a thought for those 440 women across @entity12 who will lose their lives today simply giving birth			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			0

for many @entity25 women , giving birth is a dangerous process
440 women in @entity12 die giving birth every day
many @entity25 women can not access adequate care during pregnancy , says campaigner
