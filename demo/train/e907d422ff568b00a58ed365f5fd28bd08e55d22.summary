@entity0 is one of the world 's poorest countries , seen as well behind most everyone when it comes to most technologies and much more			2
@entity7 may not be one of them			0
scant resources or not , a defector who once worked as a computer expert for the @entity0 government says that it has a vast network of hackers devoted to cyberwarfare against perceived enemies of the stalinist state			2
@entity20 , who defected from @entity0 seven years ago , told @entity21 that he thinks there are 1,800 cyberwarriors in the agency stationed around the world			1
but he says even the agents themselves do n't know how many others work for the secretive group , called @entity30 121 , whose mission is to " conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states			0
" the @entity35 government thinks @entity30 is the agency at the heart of numerous cyberattacks from @entity0 against elements in foreign countries , a government official who requested to be anonymous told @entity21 on thursday			1
@entity0 's hacking capabilities have become a global talking point recently , after a massive hack of @entity44 -- the studio behind " @entity46 , " a comedy depicting the assassination of @entity50 's leader , @entity49			1
that was followed by warnings that the movie not be shown in theaters , something that 's a nonissue , for now , after @entity44 called off its planned release wednesday			0
@entity57 outraged over @entity44 decision @entity60 investigators say an announcement blaming @entity50 for this could come as soon as thursday			0
@entity0 's government has denied responsibility for the crippling hack , even as its state news agency applauded it			1
" the hacking into the @entity44 might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with the @entity0 , " @entity66 reported			2
commenting generally on the @entity0 government 's hacking arsenal , @entity20 said he thinks the reclusive @entity75 nation 's cyberwarfare is more real and more dangerous than the regime 's ability to launch a nuclear offensive -- even if it is the latter that has contributed to expansive sanctions , other penalties and the country 's isolation on the world stage			1
said @entity20 , " this silent war -- the cyberwar -- has already begun without a single bullet fired			0
" ' @entity89 ' hacks of banks , media companies whether or not it 's behind the @entity44 hack , @entity35 intelligence thinks @entity30 121 has struck before , according to the government official			1
@entity35 has repeatedly accused the @entity0 of hacking attacks , including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that targeted banks and media organizations			1
@entity50 has rejected the allegations			0
the biggest case became known as " @entity89 , " a series of hacks between march and june 2013 that targeted @entity35 banks and media companies			1
more than 48,000 computers were hit , infecting the companies ' computer networks with a malicious program , or malware , that slowed or shut down systems			0
analyst : we underestimated @entity0 @entity116 's military ratcheted up its cyber-alert level in response , and an official @entity35 investigation later pinned the blame for this attack on its northern neighbor , finding that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used by @entity50 previously , said @entity127 , an official at the @entity128			1
a spokesman for the general staff of @entity0 's military called these allegations , which came at a time of heightened tensions between the two longtime rivals , " groundless " and " a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the @entity138 to an extreme phase , " according to @entity66			2
analyst : @entity0 ' probably popping the champagne ' assuming some of the allegations are well - founded , some might question how or why a country that 's so poor , with so few resources , would devote so much to cyberwarfare			2
@entity20 , who says he is still in contact with at least one of @entity150 's members , says the answer is simple : " raising cyberagents is fairly cheap			2
" " the world has the wrong view of the @entity0 state , " he adds			0
" with that incorrect world view , @entity0 was able to increase its ability to launch cyberattacks			0
" @entity20 attended @entity0 's military college for computer science , the @entity161 , and worked in information services for the government before defecting			1
he showed @entity21 reams of information he says was stolen by @entity0 operatives from @entity30			0
the information taken from @entity35 financial institutions , which @entity20 says he got from a @entity30 operation , appeared to list bank accounts , names and financial data			1
celebrities criticize decision to pull ' @entity46 ' the " @entity89 " hacks were harmful , but one analyst thinks that the @entity44 attack -- if it 's indeed linked to @entity0 -- represents an escalation of tactics			1
" i think we underestimated @entity0 's cybercapabilities , " said @entity180 , director of asian studies at @entity181			1
" they certainly did n't evidence this sort of capability in the previous attacks			0
" he called the @entity44 hack , and the studio 's decision to pull " @entity46 , " " a big win " for @entity50			2
" they got the @entity60 government to admit that @entity0 was the source of this , and there 's no ( public ) action plan ... in response to it , " @entity180 said			0
" i think , from their perspective in @entity50 , they 're probably popping the champagne corks			0
" things that annoy @entity0			0

@entity20 says he thinks there are 1,800 cyberwarriors in the secretive @entity150
the defector calls @entity0 's cyberwarfare more dangerous than its nuclear *weaponry*
official : @entity35 thinks @entity30 is behind hacks on @entity35 banks , media companies
analyst says linked @entity44 attack shows @entity50 's hacking abilities were " underestimated "
