-- shad @entity1 has n't gone by the name @entity1 for some time now			1
but if you squint hard enough and try to ignore the barrage of broad @entity8 - @entity7 stereotypes in his latest film , " @entity9 , " it 's easy to see that the former pint - size @entity12 protégé has grown into a likable leading man			1
in this frenetic , family - friendly riff on the friday formula , @entity1 plays @entity16 , an honest , hard - working high school grad who lives in an @entity18 housing project and punches the clock selling @entity20 at the local @entity21			2
that is , until he realizes he 's holding the winning ticket in a $ 370 million lottery			0
after his loose - lipped , @entity27 - thumping grandma ( waiting to @entity29 's @entity28 ) spills the beans about his imminent payday , a flood of characters ( or , to be more accurate , caricatures ) cozy up to him to get their cut			2
gangsters , gospel preachers , gold diggers -- @entity16 sees through their greed and ulterior motives			0
but not before going on a wild spending spree that would make @entity42 proud			0
the problem is , music video director @entity45 's blue - collar fantasy wants to have it both ways : for every well - intentioned speech @entity16 gives about the lottery being a rigged game designed to keep poor folks down , there 's a montage of him giddily blowing wads of cash on sneakers and sports cars			1
if " @entity9 " had as much conviction as laughs , it could have hit the jackpot			1
