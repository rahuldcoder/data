@entity0 -- do n't like the way airport screeners are doing their job ? you might not want to complain too much while standing in line			0
@entity7 complaining about airport security is one indicator @entity11 officers consider when looking for possible criminals and terrorists , @entity1 has learned exclusively			1
and , when combined with other behavioral indicators , it could result in a traveler facing additional scrutiny			0
@entity1 has obtained a list of roughly 70 " behavioral indicators " that @entity11 behavior detection officers use to identify potentially " high risk " passengers at the nation 's airports			1
many of the indicators , as characterized in open government reports , are behaviors and appearances that may be indicative of stress , fear or deception			0
none of them , as the @entity11 has long said , refer to or suggest race , religion or ethnicity			1
but one addresses passengers ' attitudes towards security , and how they express those attitudes			2
it reads : " very arrogant and expresses contempt against airport passenger procedures			2
" @entity11 officials declined to comment on the list of indicators , but said that no single indicator , taken by itself , is ever used to identify travelers as potentially high - risk passengers			1
travelers must exhibit several indicators before behavior detection officers steer them to more thorough screening			1
but a civil liberties organization said the list should not include behavior relating to the expression of opinions , even arrogant expressions of opinion			2
" expressing your contempt about airport procedures -- that 's a @entity70 - protected right , " said @entity63 , a former @entity64 agent who now works as legal counsel for the @entity66			1
" we all have the right to express our views , and particularly in a situation where the government is demanding the ability to search you			2
" " it 's circular reasoning where , you know , i 'm going to ask someone to surrender their rights ; if they refuse , that 's evidence that i need to take their rights away from them			0
and it 's simply inappropriate , " he said			2
the @entity11 says its security programs are informed by real - world situations and intelligence			1
indeed , the immigration agent who refused to let the alleged " 20th hijacker " into the @entity97 in 2001 later testified that the man 's arrogant behavior contributed to his suspicions			2
agent @entity101 told the 9/11 commission that @entity103 " became visibly upset " and arrogantly pointed his finger in the agent 's face when asked why he did not have an airline ticket for a return flight			0
but some experts say terrorists are much more likely to avoid confrontations with authorities , saying an @entity114 training manual instructs members to blend in			2
" i think the idea that they would try to draw attention to themselves by being arrogant at airport security , it fails the common sense test , " said @entity1 national security analyst @entity116			0
" and it also fails what we know about their behaviors in the past			0
" the 9/11 commission 's report says that " none of the checkpoint supervisors ( on september 11th ) recalled the ( successful ) hijackers or reported anything suspicious regarding their screening			2
" but , it says , an airline ticket agent that checked in hijacker @entity139 says @entity139 " reacted negatively when informed in @entity140 ( @entity141 ) that he would have to check in again in @entity143			0
" @entity139 " clenched his jaw and said ... with some irritation , ' they told me one step check - in , ' " he recalled			0
the ticket agent recommended the @entity97 hire " behavior profilers ... the way they do overseas , " the report says			2
@entity155 , former director of security at @entity158 's @entity157 , said an arrogant complaint about security is a legitimate factor to consider			2
but officials also should be suspicious of effusive praise , he said			0
" the other end of the spectrum is almost as bad , although it is maybe less offensive , " he said			0
the @entity11 is expanding the behavior detection program , formally known as @entity167 , for @entity168			1
currently , some 3,000 uniformed behavior detection officers are deployed at about 175 airports			1
president @entity171 is calling for an additional 175 such officers in his 2012 budget proposal , and the @entity11 is expected to spend a total of $ 1.2 billion on the program over the next five years			1
in recent years , the @entity11 has also expanded the scope of the program			1
originally intended to look only for suspected terrorists , the program now also seeks to ferret out possible criminals in airports			0
many details of the program are publicly available			0
according to a @entity183 report , uniformed behavior detection officers typically work in two - person teams at airport checkpoint lines , looking for behaviors that are on the @entity167 checklist , each of which is assigned a numerical value			1
the officers sometimes initiate casual conversations with passengers , particularly if a passenger is exhibiting behaviors on the @entity167 checklist			2
in most instances , the @entity183 said , the conversation resolves the suspicion			0
but if both behavior detection officers agree that observed indicators exceed a predetermined numerical threshold , the person is referred to additional screening , which can involve more questioning and physical searches of a person or property			1
if the person 's behavior escalates , accumulating more points based on the @entity167 checklist , the officers can refer the person to local law enforcement for investigation			1
after the law enforcement investigation , the @entity11 officials determine whether to allow the passenger to board the flight			1
the @entity219 says the program is successful , telling @entity221 last week that , in a recent test comparing behavior detection officers to random screening procedures , the officers were 50 times more likely to refer people they checked to local law enforcement , and about 4.5 times as likely to identify people with prohibited items or fraudulent documents			1
taken together , such officers are nine times more likely to identify " high risk " passengers than random screening , the department said			1
" spot identifies high - risk travelers at a significantly higher rate then random screening , " @entity236 of the department 's @entity237 testified			0
but one member of the study 's @entity242 said the study did not establish the program 's scientific validity			0
" the advisory committee has not been asked to evaluate the overall spot program , nor has it been asked to evaluate the validity of indicators used in the program , " @entity247 testified to @entity221 last week			0
advisory committee members were not shown the list of behavioral indicators , he said			0
" my concern is that if i 'm a member of the public and i hear ( @entity236 ' ) testimony , it sounds like the @entity167 program has been validated , " @entity247 told @entity1			0
he said that while large numbers of people were screened , very little criminal activity was detected , and the numbers may not be statistically significant			0
" the hit rate is so low on this , it could turn out to be a random glitch , " he said			0
the @entity183 also criticized the study , saying @entity11 's records are incomplete and the study is not designed to answer the big question people have about the program : does it work ? the study " is not designed to fully validate whether behavior detection can be used to reliably identify individuals in an airport environment who pose a security risk , " the agency said			1
members of @entity221 also expressed concern about the number of " false positives " -- people flagged for additional screening that resulted in nothing being found			1
for every person correctly identified as a " high risk " traveler by ( the behavior detection officers ) , 86 were misidentified , @entity236 said			1
at random screening , for every person correctly identified , 794 were misidentified			0
the @entity11 does not track the number of arrests , convictions or exonerations of people that are referred to law enforcement , he said			1
the @entity66 's @entity301 , who has not seen the behavioral indicators list , said he fears the indicators " are being used simply as a proxy for racial profiling or other inappropriate police activities			1
" the number of people arrested at airport checkpoints for immigration violations suggests the behavior detection officers are profiling , he said			1
thirty - nine percent of the 1,083 people arrested during the first four and a half years of the program were arrested because they were illegal aliens , according to the @entity183			0
experts agree that the fact that there is an extremely small number of terrorists makes it hard to evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral observation programs			1
the @entity183 said it looked at 23 occasions in which 16 individuals -- people later charged with terrorism - related activities -- passed through high - threat airports			0
none is known to have been identified			0
but it is not known if the behavior detection officers were working at the time , the agency said			1
@entity331 of the @entity183 is recommending the @entity11 study airport videos of those instances			2
" we believe such recordings could help identify behaviors that may be common among terrorists , or could demonstrate that terrorists do not generally display any identifying behaviors , " @entity331 said .			0

@entity11 officers look at people who " express contempt "
the @entity66 says that indicator is inappropriate
the @entity11 says no single factor results in added screening
experts *differ* on the effectiveness of behavior observation
