-- @entity2 ' dream of skiing at the @entity4 is over but the recriminations keep on flying			2
earlier this week the @entity6 said @entity2 had made herself unavailable for selection in @entity4 after an issue with an adaptive boot she uses to ski			1
@entity2 , former wife of @entity11 star @entity10 , had her left leg amputated below the knee after a road accident in 1993 and declared her intention to try and make the @entity16 over two years ago			0
but now she has been accused of grabbing an official from the @entity18 during a discussion about the eligibility of her equipment			2
@entity23 , the @entity18 's director of communications , told the @entity25 @entity24 that @entity2 had to be restrained after an alleged confrontation with the organization 's skiing chief @entity27			1
now @entity2 could be fined for her outburst , though the sequence of events presented by the @entity18 has been disputed by her own team			1
" she was screaming , ' you 're a b * * * h , you 're a b * * * h , you do n't know who i am , i 'm going to make your life miserable , ' " @entity23 was quoted as saying by the @entity25 @entity24			0
" @entity27 tried to walk away and @entity2 moved and grabbed at her and had to be restrained by the @entity25 coach			1
" @entity2 has subsequently claimed in her statements that she has got an injury caused by the @entity18 forcing her to wear a heavier boot , but as far as we 're aware she has been using the unapproved boot all season			1
" we had notified her and her coach that if she continues to compete on that boot she would be disqualified but that her results from the season and monday would still stand			0
" @entity2 's subsequent statement that she had been disqualified is nonsense			2
" despite missing out on @entity4 , @entity2 has not given up on winter sports competition			0
" @entity27 will step down after @entity4 and maybe then the management of disabled sport can be reassessed , so that disabled athletes are treated with fairness and supported in their attempts to represent their country , in the same way able - bodied athletes are , " said a @entity2 statement			2
" although her hopes and dreams for @entity4 are now over , @entity2 hopes to one day compete in @entity63 sports when the @entity18 re-evaluate the unfair systems that they have in place			1
in another statement given to the @entity68 , @entity2 ' team also refuted the @entity18 's version of events			1
it read : " @entity2 waited patiently -- as the @entity18 confirmed -- to try and explain to @entity27 that her left boot was legal and purely cosmetic to abide by the archaic @entity18 rules			1
" it was just cut down and the buckles removed to stop more weight limb damage			0
" the statement went on to claim @entity78 had shouted at @entity2 , refusing to let a @entity80 coach who was present explain the situation , before storming off			0
@entity2 has won a series of medals since launching her bid to make the @entity25 @entity86 team , but has also suffered a string of injuries , fracturing her shoulder , snapping her cruciate ligament and damaging her scapula			1
she married former @entity11 @entity10 in 2002 , four years after the singer 's late wife @entity92 died , but the couple divorced six years later			0
the @entity6 said in a statement on tuesday that @entity2 had decided to resign from @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , and thus give up any chance of being picked for @entity4			0
it added : " occasionally in sport equipment issues arise , especially with adaptive equipment and the interpretation of the rules in relation to its use			0
" therefore we are all saddened that she has decided to retire at this stage , rather than working with @entity96 and @entity106 to resolve the issue			0
" @entity2 has shown determination and made great progress over the past few months and is to be commended for the success she 's had in her skiing career			2

@entity2 accused of *verbally* abusing an @entity113
@entity2 has given up on her hope of making the @entity25 team for the 2014 @entity117
a *problem* with her adaptive boot for skiing meant she was *ineligible* to compete
@entity18 says she *physically* *harassed* the organization 's skiing chief @entity27
