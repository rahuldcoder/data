@entity0 -- controversial @entity3 striker @entity2 will be given another chance after being caught in a heated training ground bust - up with manager @entity6 on thursday			1
photographers outside the @entity10 champions ' training ground captured images of the pair grappling , prompting coaching staff to intervene to separate them			1
@entity2 then walked off the pitch , before leaving the training ground about 10 minutes later			2
the flamboyant 22 - year - old has infuriated his manager on several occasions since being signed from @entity19 for $ 39.1 million in 2010			0
@entity6 recently said that the @entity21 international needed to train harder to make the playing team , and once threatened he may never play for @entity3 again after he was sent off during a defeat at @entity24			1
but in a statement on the club 's website , @entity6 -- who the photographs suggest was the aggressor , repeatedly tugging the player 's clothes -- downplayed the exchange , which was sparked by @entity2 's hostile challenge on @entity35			1
" @entity2 made a tackle on his teammate that i would prefer to see in a game , and not against a teammate , " said @entity6			1
" i asked him to leave the pitch -- he said no , so i moved him off			0
that 's all that happened and it was nothing more than that			0
" the @entity46 described the incident as " nothing unusual " and insisted it had " already been forgotten			0
" @entity2 appeared at the club as usual for training on friday			1
" my thoughts have not changed about him and these things happen from time to time , " @entity6 said			2
" will @entity2 have more chances ? i will give him 100 chances as long as i can see him trying to improve and working hard for this football club			1
" the gifted but inconsistent performer 's relationship with his club and manager have often been strained , prompting @entity6 to once remark after a match that if @entity2 had been a teammate during his own playing days , he may have given him a punch in the head every day			1
since his arrival in the @entity63 , @entity2 has made headlines for setting his house on fire with fireworks , handing out wads of money to the homeless , tussling with teammates on the pitch and throwing darts at his club 's youth team players			2
his poor disciplinary record , which saw him miss a total of 11 domestic and @entity79 games through suspension during the past season , led the club to dock him two weeks ' wages			0
@entity2 appealed to an @entity10 tribunal over the fine , but recently dropped the matter in a gesture the club described as " a sign of respect for @entity6 , the supporters and the club			1
" despite @entity2 's failure to impress on the pitch this season , @entity6 recently insisted the club would not be selling the striker during the january transfer window , stressing his " love " for his fiery compatriot -- who he also managed at @entity19			1
" i think @entity2 will stay but the future depends mostly on him , " he told @entity46 media			2
" the relationship between me and him is always good , even if one day he does something			0
i love him because for many years we live together			0
i 've seen him grow			0
but the professional relationship is another thing and i 've told @entity2 what i need from him			0
" the time of cheap talk is over			0
@entity2 is 22 years old and now it 's time to be professional			2
i ask from him seriousness and commitment in training , a more stable private life and correct behavior on the pitch			0
