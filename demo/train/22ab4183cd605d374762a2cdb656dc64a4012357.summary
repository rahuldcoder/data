-- @entity1 says that , at first , he welcomed his wife 's new interest in @entity4			1
she had recently recovered from a bout with depression and dependence on prescription drugs , and he thought reconnecting with old friends would help get her out of her rut			0
but he says he became increasingly suspicious of her social networking activity when she began hiding her computer screen when he entered the room			0
@entity1 soon discovered his wife was using the site to meet up with an old boyfriend -- an increasingly common occurrence as more and more adults join @entity4			1
@entity1 , 38 , of @entity21 , @entity22 , is the creator of @entity23 , a website he started in 2009 shortly after he discovered his wife 's affair in an effort " to help others cope with someone cheating on them as well as shine light upon someone who is using @entity4 to cheat			1
" a recent survey by the @entity33 of @entity34 found that 81 percent of divorce attorneys have seen an increase in the number of cases using social networking evidence during the past five years			1
more than 66 percent of those attorneys said the no. 1 site most often used as evidence is @entity4 with its 400 million registered users			1
another recent survey by @entity45 of more than 5,000 divorce petitions says @entity4 is mentioned in about 20 percent of divorce cases			2
" as everyone continues to share more and more aspects of their lives on social networking sites , they leave themselves open to much greater examinations of both their public and private lives in these sensitive situations , " @entity48 , president of the @entity49 , said in a statement of the survey 's results			1
@entity1 , who says he has nothing against @entity4 and uses it regularly to connect with childhood friends , told @entity70 's " @entity69 " wednesday that the networking site is simply " a tool for an affair			1
" he says that if there is trouble within a marriage or a relationship , " the affair 's going to happen anyway , " but @entity4 " makes it much easier			2
" @entity76 , a spokesman for @entity4 , says the website is not responsible for breaking up marriages			2
" it 's ludicrous to suggest that @entity4 leads to divorce and we would suggest that anyone who purports to have conducted surveys about the topic also ask respondents about other popular communication channels , such as text messaging , chat sites and email , before jumping to conclusions , " @entity76 said			1
@entity91 , a psychotherapist and relationship expert , says she estimates @entity4 plays a much larger factor in divorces			0
" it 's not just your everyday affair , " @entity98 told " @entity69			0
" " when it comes to something like @entity4 , you are reconnecting with a long - lost love			0
all those teenage feelings , those college feelings come back again , you feel young again , and it drives you to do something you do n't normally do			0
" @entity1 , who is separated and living apart from his wife , says communication with your spouse is key to keeping your @entity4 page as a place to network , not coordinate illicit rendezvous			1
" in the beginning when we first got on @entity4 , we would openly talk " about shared friends ' new babies and other milestones posted on the site , @entity1 told @entity70			2
" when it got real quiet , that was the problem , " he said			0
@entity120 , a clinical therapist whose self - proclaimed mission is to cut the divorce rate by half , says the mistake most couples make is placing priorities on material things rather than partnership			0
" we need to put that energy , that time , that money into the relationship , " she told " @entity69			0
" " that 's where you want to feel the excitement and the rush			0
