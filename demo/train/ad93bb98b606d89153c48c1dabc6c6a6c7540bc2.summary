-- the january monthly jobs report numbers released by the federal government could at best be described as tepid , adding to an already gloomy picture of the state of the economy for @entity8 's workers			1
and that 's just the latest cloud in an increasingly dark forecast for the middle class			2
in @entity15 , the reliably middle - class retailer @entity13 's is shutting its doors and will be replaced by the high - end store @entity17			1
middle - class restaurants such as @entity19 are struggling while the high - end , artisanal foodie scene is still going strong			1
@entity22 reports that sales for its most expensive appliances are increasing while sales for midrange models are plummeting			0
taken as a whole , these developments are about more than our consumption , reflecting the profound economic inequality in @entity8 today			0
our new economic reality is a final nail in the coffin of conservative economics			0
supply - side economics was developed in the 1970s as a direct response to the @entity39 analysis dominant in the decades since the @entity40			1
the organizing principle for conservative fiscal policy in the 40 years since , supply - side economics holds that the best way to stimulate economic growth is by lessening obstacles that inhibit people or companies from supplying goods or services			1
conservatives supply - siders argue that if we cut taxes and reduce regulations for business and those who own businesses ( i.e. , the rich ) , they 'll invest more in producing goods and therefore increase employment			1
also more supply means lower prices , which conservatives also believe is good for growth			2
but if it was n't bad enough that decades of supply - side deregulation and tax cuts had created levels of economic inequality not seen in @entity8 since the 1920s , as a @entity72 report now suggests , not only did supply - side economics fail to spur demand but it reduced and stratified demand to match patterns of inequality more broadly			1
the top marginal tax rate , which was raised to 79 % at the time of the @entity80 and was 91 % under @entity81 , was cut to 70 % under @entity82 , then 50 % under @entity83 , then an abysmally low 35 % under @entity84			2
according to supply - side theory , these and other extreme tax cuts for big business and the rich should have led to an extreme flourishing of investment in business , including creating more jobs that would , metaphorically speaking , lift all boats			1
instead the rich pocketed much of those tax cuts , adding to their net worth and spending more heavily on luxury goods			1
the good news is that the @entity72 article confirms that consumer demand -- not business - side supply -- is the essential driving force in our economy , with that demand directing how businesses invest in producing goods and services			1
the bad news is that , thanks to failed supply - side economics , we increasingly have only two kinds of demand in @entity8 -- for cheap mass - market goods and for incredibly pricey high - end commodities			1
conservative economics did not lift all boats			0
middle - class jobs lost in the recession have been disproportionately replaced with low - wage jobs in the recovery			1
poverty is on the rise			0
and yet yacht sales are buoyant			0
the number and cost of luxury yachts sold in @entity8 is steadily rising			0
and do n't expect those yachts to " trickle - down " magically and create housing for the millions of @entity8 who faced foreclosures in the last several years			2
according to conservative economic theory , increased corporate profits and income for the top 1 % should have translated directly into higher wages for everyone else			1
but the fact is even though worker productivity is up in @entity8 , wages for most people have either stagnated or declined			0
ask any conservative thinker or leader to explain this discrepancy			0
because their entire economic worldview has backfired and hurt the middle class			2
one might think in the face of overwhelming evidence that their economic theories simply do n't work , conservatives would try something new			0
like supporting an increase in the federal minimum wage or temporarily expanding unemployment benefits or investing federal dollars ( at currently ridiculously low borrowing rates ) to rebuild infrastructure while creating jobs -- all of which puts money in folks ' pockets and spurs demand			0
which , in turn , drives up economic growth and increases tax revenue			2
but no. leading @entity174 still insist that the answer to @entity8 's economic problems is more tax cuts and fewer regulations on business -- in other words , precisely more of what created extreme inequality and stifled economic demand in the first place			1
incidentally , consumption as a whole is n't down			0
in fact , even though average incomes are flat , consumption in general has risen			0
and yet to the extent that ordinary @entity8 continue to fuel their consumption with more debt and reduced rates of savings -- and to the extent that structural inequalities in the economy remain unaddressed -- their spending is unsustainable			0
meanwhile , a dollar in the hand of a billionaire does n't create the same economic demand as a dollar in the hand of someone else -- because the rich are more likely to save , not spend , their money			2
so behind the sad , immediate tale of disappointing job growth and the disappearing middle - class market for goods and services is the profoundly unsettling reality that the pursuit of supply - side economics was not only wrong but may have fundamentally broken our economy -- and undermined any potential for diversely driven demand and broadly shared prosperity			1
this may not be the economy you wanted , but it 's the economy your policies have definitely created			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			0

@entity232 : @entity235 report for january shows tepid growth
she says divide between rich and poor shows failure of supply - side economic theory
tax cuts for *wealthy* have n't led to a surge in investment , more middle - class jobs , she says
@entity232 : spending and saving by the rich flourish , while the 99 % find it harder to thrive
