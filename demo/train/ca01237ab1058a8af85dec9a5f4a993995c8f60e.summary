lawmakers in the @entity2 have called for an inquiry into allegations that public funds were used to " hide " homeless families at a resort during the @entity9 's recent visit			1
the @entity2 @entity10 ( @entity10 ) has confirmed that 340 members of 100 homeless families were removed from @entity13 , a major @entity14 thoroughfare , and temporarily relocated to a beach resort about 90 kilometers ( 55 miles ) away for the duration of the @entity9 visit			1
the families returned after the @entity9 's departure			1
a resolution before the @entity2 @entity21 has called on the government to summon the head of the @entity10 for a probe into whether $ 97,600 spent on the six - day training course at the resort in @entity27 , @entity28 , amounted to a misuse of public funds			2
rep. @entity31 , one of the lawmakers behind the resolution , said in a statement he was concerned that the families had been rounded up from @entity13 , which the @entity9 convoy traveled several times during the @entity9 's january 15 - 19 visit			1
he said the episode highlighted the " frivolous manner " in which the government implemented anti-poverty programs			0
the training course at the resort had been been funded as part of a program with the objective of " keeping families off the streets by training them how to live in a house , " read the resolution , which was also sponsored by rep. @entity48 and rep. @entity49			2
however , " after the papal visit , the families who participated in the ' training ' were returned to the streets , " raising questions about the program 's effectiveness in terms of its " supposed objective of reducing poverty , " said the resolution			2
in an unrelated @entity66 hearing tuesday , @entity10 secretary @entity64 was asked about the issue , and confirmed that homeless families from the boulevard had been sent to the resort			2
she said the department had already intended to enroll the families in the training program , and had considered the period of the @entity9 's visit would be the ideal time to do so			1
" to prepare for @entity79 ' arrival ... local governments wanted to make sure that @entity13 was in a secure and safe state , and so were the ( homeless ) people ... with the influx of people in the area , " she told the hearing			0
" so when we reached out to the families on @entity13 , since we were already planning to register them to the @entity87 , we thought it could be the right time to hold the orientation from january 15 to 19			0
" the government 's @entity87 ( @entity91 ) program is described on a government website as a " complete package of assistance to street families ... with access to social services and economic opportunities for the improvement of their living conditions			0
" @entity31 's resolution alleged that the resort stay was " not the first time that @entity10 ( had ) made an attempt to cover up the massive inequality in the country			0
" it claimed that during the @entity111 on @entity112 held in @entity14 in may last year , families were relocated to another resort for similar training			1
the plight of the poor , particularly street children , was a touchstone during @entity79 ' visit to the predominantly @entity120 country			0
at a @entity121 , the @entity9 embraced former street children , who asked him why @entity123 had allowed them to suffer .			0
