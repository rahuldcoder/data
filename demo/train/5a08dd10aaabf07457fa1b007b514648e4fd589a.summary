-- five - year - old @entity1 was last seen by his @entity3 relatives on september 14			1
but the investigation into his disappearance did n't begin until last week when the authorities were first alerted to it			0
now , the child is feared dead , his mother and her boyfriend are in custody , and everyone is left wondering how a child could simply vanish unnoticed for three months			1
how could this happen , especially to a child who was supposed to be receiving monthly visits from a state - provided social worker ? turns out , tragically , @entity1 was not getting the visits , state officials say			1
who 's to blame ? the finger pointing , demands for accountability and calls for investigations are reverberating throughout the state			2
" this is a deeply concerning case of neglect and abuse , " said @entity26 , commissioner of the @entity27			1
the state agency was charged with the responsibility of protecting children from child abuse			0
@entity26 called the situation " a serious failure " and put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the boy 's social worker and supervisor , both of whom were quickly fired			1
" the social worker assigned to this case did not conduct the required in - person , monthly checks on the family , " @entity26 said in a statement			1
" and the supervisor failed to enforce that policy			0
" neither the social worker nor the supervisor have been named , but their union spokesman says they have been made " convenient scapegoats " at an overwhelmed agency			0
" we are disappointed that commissioner @entity62 is more interested in finger - pointing than accepting responsibility for yet another tragedy on her watch , " said @entity59 of the @entity60 , which represents caseworkers at the @entity27			1
" instead , the commissioner has chosen a convenient scapegoat to deflect blame from department administrators			2
" more blame to go around but gov. @entity73 hinted friday that they might not be the only two held accountable			0
" i 've asked the commissioner to look into the question about whether responsibility goes beyond those two , " he said in an appearance on @entity76			2
" i have some reason to believe it does			0
" the last documentation of an interaction with @entity1 was in may , according to @entity84 spokesman @entity83			1
in june , @entity83 says the social worker was told that @entity1 had moved to @entity86 to live with his grandmother , but never bothered to follow up or verify whether that was the case			1
the last time a visit to the home occurred was in november , at which @entity83 says the social worker left behind a business card indicating that this would be @entity27 's final visit			2
just days later , on december 2 , @entity1 's 8 - year - old sister disclosed to counselors at her elementary school that her mom 's boyfriend , @entity98 , 22 , had abused her , according to a police affidavit			1
multiple calls to @entity103 's attorney have gone unreturned			2
" as a result of those statements " the affidavit continues , " [ she ] and [ another brother that is n't @entity1 ] were removed from the home and taken into protective custody			1
" when cops asked @entity113 , 28 , where her third child @entity1 was , she told them that he had moved to @entity86 , a law enforcement source involved in the investigation told @entity0			1
this time , however , she was going to have to prove it			0
where is @entity1 ? @entity1 went before a state juvenile judge at a hearing on december 13 , where she was " observed to have bruises , disheveled hair , and appeared to have been assaulted , " according to court documents			1
she refused to divulge @entity1 's whereabouts , according to the source			1
the judge ordered her to produce the child within 72 hours			0
the time passed with no sign of @entity1			2
the mother has been charged with two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of accessory after the fact of a felony ( assault and battery with a dangerous weapon ) , according to a statement from @entity146 district attorney @entity145			0
a plea of not guilty was entered on her behalf			0
those charges may not necessarily pertain to @entity1 and more details could emerge at a december 24 hearing , a spokesman for the district attorney 's office said			1
@entity113 's attorney , @entity155 , was n't able to elaborate either			0
" i met with her for 10 hours and was unable to obtain any significant information " @entity155 said , prompting him to seek a mental health evaluation to determine whether she was even competent enough to stand charges			0
he says that evaluation is currently underway			0
@entity103 , meanwhile , is charged with two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and two counts of assault and battery on a child causing bodily injury , according to the district attorney 's office said			0
a plea of not guilty was also entered on his behalf			0
he also has a hearing scheduled for december 24			0
for now , authorities are holding out hope that @entity1 might be out there somewhere , and they 're asking anyone who might know anything to call the @entity181 .			2
