@entity0 is the author of " @entity1 : a @entity2			1
" he is @entity3 and @entity4 at @entity5 in @entity6			0
his web site is @entity8 /			0
@entity0 says allegations of rape and torture are testing @entity1 's @entity12 as never before			1
( @entity13 ) -- troubling news of kidnapping , rape , torture , and murder is flooding out of @entity1			1
@entity19 was murdered point - blank in the streets of @entity21 for the whole world to see ; while @entity23 was killed far from any global attention and his body given to his mother quietly to bury , as was the tortured body of @entity28			0
these names have assumed symbolic significance for many more innocent young men and women murdered by the custodians of the @entity12 with a wanton disregard for the lives and liberties of its own citizens			2
not just murder , but the rape of young men and women also is on the shameless roster of the @entity12			1
after years of sporadic charges and troubling rumors , finally a courageous cleric has put a stamp of public recognition on atrocious practices in the theocratic state			2
@entity49 -- one of the revolutionary founders of the @entity12 , a high - ranking cleric , a presidential candidate , a former speaker of the house and now a widely popular political activist -- has published a letter , addressing it to the former president and current head of the @entity59 @entity58			1
he accuses the security officers of the @entity12 of repeatedly and violently raping young women and men while they are in custody			1
since the publication of this letter , a massive outpouring of testimony and reports has come out , corroborating @entity49 's charges that rapes of young women and men are a widespread , common practice in the @entity12			1
these are not light charges for any state , for any republic , let alone for an @entity12			2
these charges are no longer brought by expatriate , and at times discredited , opposition			0
it is the founding fathers of the @entity12 , with impeccable revolutionary credentials , who are bringing these charges , as others are coming out and corroborating them in excruciating detail			2
the @entity12 has never faced such a deep crisis of legitimacy in its turbulent 30 - year history			2
as widely evident , it is not just the regime 's claim to a " republic " that is in question and in jeopardy , but , perhaps far more seriously , it is its claim to @entity100 that has troubling consequences for more than 1.3 billion @entity102 around the world			2
people in the streets of @entity21 are chanting , paraphrasing a famous slogan of the 1979 revolution , " @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , " pointedly replacing " @entity110 " for " @entity100			0
" though this a perfectly legitimate demand , given the criminal record of the @entity12 , by no means is this sentiment a common denominator of the growing opposition to the regime			0
to the degree that , at least in part , he represents this uprising , @entity122 , as a pious and practicing @entity100 , continues to insist that he wishes to restore the ideals and aspirations of the @entity100 revolution within the constitution of the state			0
never have the two opposing ideas of an " @entity12 , " and @entity102 living in a democratic republic seemed so at odds with each other			1
the 30 - year experience of the @entity12 shows fundamental flaws in defining a state apparatus in the exclusive terms of a militantly legalistic @entity100 , while at the same time @entity1 , the overwhelming majority of them @entity102 , have repeatedly demonstrated , under this regime , they are perfectly capable of democratic behavior			1
not just as immigrants in the @entity143 nations and the @entity144 , but as citizens in @entity1 , millions of @entity102 have shown they are integral to the democratic institutions embedded in the notion of a nation - state			1
what is in question is the viability of an @entity100 republic -- or for that matter , a jewish state , a @entity156 empire , a @entity158 fundamentalist government -- or any state or movement that is defined not by the democratic apparatus of citizenry , but by exclusionary membership in a world religion			0
as in the rest of the @entity100 world , @entity100 is integral to @entity110 society			0
over the last 30 years , a radically legalistic interpretation of a cosmopolitan faith has been force - fed into a multifaceted political culture -- and today all the world can see the violent convulsion of the system			0
there has been much talk of the need for an @entity100 " reformation " over the last few years			0
but what @entity100 needs is not a @entity156 - style reformation			0
what @entity100 needs is a restoration of its historically cosmopolitan character in which @entity102 and @entity183 live in peace and prosperity , and which they now need to retrieve in order to live in peace and prosperity in a world that is not entirely @entity100			1
by virtue of living in a democracy , and having endured indignities of rampant @entity193 in their own country , @entity144 @entity102 have a historic role to play , by way of sending a delegation to @entity1 , connecting to this grassroots democratic movement in a @entity100 nation , and helping it restore its cosmopolitan character in pursuit of enduring democratic institutions			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			0
