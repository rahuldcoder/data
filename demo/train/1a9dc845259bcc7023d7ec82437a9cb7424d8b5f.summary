@entity0 , @entity1 -- a freelance cameraman who visited @entity0 recently put together a video that provides a rare glimpse of life in the embattled city and an even rarer close - up of the opposition movement in @entity1			1
at the headquarters of the government secret police , the cameraman -- who uses the name @entity12 to avoid retribution by the government if he returns -- finds himself in the thick of a battle			1
some 200 members of the @entity20 , made of military defectors , are involved in the attack			1
they explode a bomb below a rooftop position , where government snipers are trapped			2
in the video , portions of which @entity2 aired friday , the opposition appears organized , their members communicating by walkie - talkie and engaging in fierce fighting			1
casualties are taken via minibus to a makeshift field hospital , where they are placed on thin mats on the floor			2
" my eye ! my eye ! " shouts one man whose eye had been targeted by a bullet			1
@entity12 's camera follows opposition fighters as they enter the government building , where room - to - room and stairwell - to - stairwell fighting ensues			1
finally , as bullets continue to fly , the opposition fighters make off with boxes of ammunition so they can return to fight another day			2
after 20 hours , 15 opposition fighters have been killed , 40 wounded			1
the next day , the building is gutted by local residents			2
not all the battles are so bloody			2
@entity12 says they are sometimes able to persuade government forces to cede ground without firing a shot			2
" they always try , first , to make negotiations work , " @entity12 says			2
" they talk with the officer , they talk with the soldiers , and they offer them either to defect , either to surrender , and leave the checkpoint			0
" civilian volunteers are plentiful ; more and more , they are being joined by defectors from government forces , @entity12 says			1
across @entity0 , some estimates put the @entity20 strength at more than 1,000			1
each neighborhood has its own command , but they sometimes combine forces to improve their odds against the much larger and better - armed government forces			0
some soldiers who do n't desert nevertheless sell their weapons or ammunition to the opposition , the cameraman adds			1
" there are many people who are in favor of them , who feel they are in favor of the opposition , " @entity12 says			0
down one street , his camera shows a long line of residents lined up outside a bakery for bread			0
" because of the snipers , people are taking more than they need , " says the man who is handing out the loaves			1
" that 's why it 's crowded			0
" two days earlier , in a nearby district , hundreds of residents fill the streets to mourn the deaths of 138 people in overnight shelling by government forces			0
without enough coffins to go around , many of the dead are wrapped in white shrouds			0
" shelling people is what cowards and scoundrels do , " the imam says			0
" be careful of gathering in public			0
" " we are going to heaven ! " the crowd chants , their fists pumping the air			0
" there are millions of us ! " @entity12 comes upon a woman just as she learns that her son has been fatally shot by a sniper			0
" he is my son ! my rock ! " she wails			0
" i have no man ! he is my man ! " her son , a former supporter of the regime , bears a tattoo on his chest that says " @entity138			1
" next to that is the entry point for the bullet			0
a couple of blocks away , the shelling that has pockmarked much of the city has spared a district where many residents belong to the @entity149 sect to which president @entity138 belongs			1
@entity0 is now a patchwork divided along sectarian lines			1
