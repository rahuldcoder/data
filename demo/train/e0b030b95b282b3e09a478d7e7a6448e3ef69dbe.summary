@entity0 , @entity1 -- the strange , twisted metal @entity4 - looking apparatus is known in farming circles as a pivot			2
it might also be called a life - saver or , at the very least , a farm - saver			2
because if you 're a farmer and you have a pivot -- a farming word for irrigation system -- then you 're probably not feeling the effects of the drought that is now plaguing more than 60 % of the @entity17 " we 've put in a lot of pivots in the last five years for people that never did have it before , " said @entity18 of @entity19 in @entity1			1
" it hurts us to see their crops burning up because we know that they 're losing money			2
" @entity18 says his irrigation business has doubled in the past two years			1
the summer is supposed to be his slower season , but not recently			2
typically , he says , the summer season is busy with repairs , but the past couple of years , his company is doing more installations in places like a soybean field in @entity41 , @entity1			2
" we 're not normally still behind putting up pivots			2
we 're still putting them in for this year 's crop , " he said			1
no drought aid for farmers as @entity51 breaks for summer more than half of all @entity17 counties have been designated disaster zones , the @entity52 reported , blaming excessive heat and a devastating drought that 's spread across the @entity58 and contributed to rising food prices			1
according to the agency , only 27 % of @entity17 farmland has irrigation systems			1
they 're expensive , running well over $ 100,000 , depending on the size of the field that needs watering			0
but it appears to be a necessary investment for farmers struggling to deal with harsh heat and little rain			0
betting on the gift of rain from @entity73 is a lot like rolling the dice			0
" once a crop is growing , during each week , it has specific water requirements , " said @entity76 of @entity77			1
" if those water requirements are not met that week , then the yield is diminished			0
" little hope for worsening drought in @entity84 @entity76 's crews are working six days a week , almost 12 hours a day , to install and repair watering systems for farmers			1
on this day , he and his crew are working on a cotton field , connecting a new well to irrigation pivots on the other end of a cotton field			1
the farm 's surface water is drying up , so @entity96 needed a well drilled to help guarantee a return for his money on his cotton			1
" it 's a debt to me , but it 's a benefit to me to have a commodity to sell , " he said			1
" this is my insurance			0
" nearby , at @entity104 in @entity105 , peaches are nearing the end of their harvest -- and what growers say has been a great year			0
they 're getting paid almost 50 % more for their fruit this year			0
" these peaches are really full of sugar ' cause of the lack of rain , the lack of water , " orchard owner @entity112 said			0
" you can taste the difference			0
" but even these peaches could n't count on rain			0
@entity112 's orchard has irrigation on about 70 % of its land			1
" everybody is realizing that water enables us to have a better number at the end of the season , " @entity112 said			0
the drought , they say , has resulted in a smaller , sweeter peach that will allow @entity1 to live up to its nickname as the @entity1			2
too much water and rain can hurt the fruit , because it promotes rot			0
this year , there was little worry about that			0
