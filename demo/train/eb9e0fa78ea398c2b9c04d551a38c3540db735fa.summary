viewers are watching more television on more kinds of screens than ever			2
the report , issued monday and covering the last three months of 2008 , shows that the average @entity1 television viewer is watching more than 151 hours of television per month -- an " all - time " high -- up from more than 145 hours during the same period the previous year , @entity14 said			1
the increase in television watching is part of a long - term trend , said @entity14 spokesman @entity19			1
he attributed the rise to a greater availability of televisions -- the average household has more televisions than people , he said -- and to niche programming			0
there are " many , many more cable channels than before , " he said			0
read the full report ( @entity30 ) also contributing to the increase are digital recorders , @entity34 and @entity35 devices , which allow viewers to watch programs at their leisure rather than during the show 's slated time slots			1
@entity14 has dubbed such viewing " timeshifted tv			1
" " dvr has helped keep television alive and well , " said @entity43 , the founding director of the @entity44 for @entity45 and @entity46 at @entity47			0

the presidential election likely helped augment viewership , @entity43 said			0
the " new series of this year was ' the @entity73 , ' " he quipped			0
the tanking economy may also have played a role in the uptick in television watching , as @entity1 looked for low - cost ways to entertain themselves , some analysts said			1
@entity1 are staying at home instead of going out , and they 're also taking fewer vacations , said @entity82 , an analyst with @entity83 , an investment banking firm			2
and while @entity43 and @entity85 , a communication professor at @entity86 , say the state of the economy certainly is n't going to hurt television viewership , both experts emphasized that the increased viewership trend is several years old			0
they also cautioned against reading too much into the @entity14 statistics			2
though @entity14 reports @entity1 are watching five hours of television a day , @entity85 noted that @entity14 has no means of determining if they are paying close attention to the programs or if they just have them on in the background			1
people may have the television on while they are doing other things , @entity43 added .			0
