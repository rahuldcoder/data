-- in 2011 , as the world marked 10 years since 9/11 , we asked artists around the globe to illustrate the ripple effects of the terrorist attacks			1
the result was " @entity8 , " @entity0 's first digital art gallery			1
with the 2012 elections approaching , we again wanted to include artists in our coverage of a major news event			1
artists provide unique insight and provoke thought , conversation and community in a critical way and are especially vital during such important times for our country and our world			1
this time we chose the theme of " @entity24 " for our digital art gallery			1
the theme represents not just the obvious power that 's at stake in the election but the more subtle forces that power us as a people and drive our debate over money , health , race and gender -- often to the point of protest and gridlock			1
explore the " power " digital election art gallery we then reached out to a broad yet select group of artists representing different , influential perspectives in the art world and the broader community and asked them to submit work and participate in building the gallery with us			1
our search began in the spring when we met @entity52 , an exciting @entity53 performance artist who was in @entity54 for a collaboration with flux projects			0
after watching a presentation of his work -- which included videos of creative street art that many would call vandalism -- we asked if he 'd be interested in contributing to " power , " the only caveat being that he could n't vandalize anything			1
the work he submitted is provocative -- a photograph of a @entity72 camera on a pole in @entity74 in @entity75 that appears to be on fire			0
his statement for " @entity78 " sums up his approach : " some people say the world will end in fire , while others say it will end with ice			2
freeze , we are watching you ! " ( @entity52 promises us that nothing was damaged and no laws were broken in producing his work			0
) no less provocative is a video by @entity89 , " @entity90			0
" set to a syncopated jazz - era beat , his stop - motion animation is a commentary on individuality , beliefs , media influence , health care , elections and more			2
@entity99 , who took part in the @entity102 movement in @entity103 and initiated @entity104 and @entity105 , created " @entity24			1
" the video juxtaposes images of the @entity108 with a rotating gold coin , and his statement explains his intentions : " the fear instinct tells us to grab what we need to survive ... yet we live in a nation that once took the goddess of freed slaves as its muse			0
" another video performance artist we 're excited about featuring is @entity119			0
her " @entity133 " video , complete with actors , a focus group moderator and a pop - up newsroom in @entity103 's @entity132 , " explores the power of polls to influence public opinion and the persuasive effects of the so - called ' man on the street ' news segments			1
" other works include @entity136 's " @entity135 , " @entity138 's " @entity137 " and @entity140 's " @entity139			2
" @entity136 , a @entity141 illustrator whose work has appeared in major publications and ad campaigns , took part in " @entity146			0
" his work this year features " over-smiley portraits " of president @entity149 and @entity150 , which he says represent " violence and power in a fight between ... two different energies			2
" @entity138 's playful painting featuring fish is a " metaphor for revolution and counterrevolution " following the @entity160 and @entity102 movements			2
and @entity140 's " tornado " portrays a woman creating a destructive whirlwind in her home -- a symbol , she says , of the interplay of democracy , voters and corporate donors			0
this is only a taste of what you 'll find in " power , " our effort to create a space in which different voices can be heard in ways other than words			0
we hope it will be thought provoking , and we invite you to join the conversation by posting your comments on the gallery .			0
