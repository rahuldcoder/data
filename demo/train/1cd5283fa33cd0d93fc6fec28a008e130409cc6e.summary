@entity0 an out - of - this - world collection of vintage @entity5 photos -- including the first " selfie " taken in space and a rare image of pioneering astronaut @entity9 on the @entity10 -- are to go up for sale in @entity0			1
the treasure trove of more than 600 images , including some of the most significant moments in lunar exploration , was put together over decades by a dedicated collector			1
the pictures will go under the hammer at @entity19 in @entity0 on february 26 , where they are expected to sell for between £ 300 ( $ 465 ) and £ 10,000 ( $ 15,525 ) -- a total of upwards of £ 500,000			0
among the highlights of the sale is a photograph snapped by @entity27 -- later the second man to step onto the @entity10 -- during the @entity30 mission in november 1966 , which is believed to be the first space " selfie			1
" it is tipped to sell for £ 600 to £ 800 ( $ 932 to $ 1,242 )			0
@entity27 also features in perhaps the most famous image in the sale : the so - called " visor photograph " showing him on the @entity10 on july 20,1969 during the @entity38 mission			2
a spokesman for @entity19 said the picture , taken by @entity9 just minutes after he had made his " one small step " speech and featuring the pioneering astronaut reflected in his colleague 's helmet visor , was likely to excite a lot of interest from bidders			2
" a picture like that still has enormous power today , " the photography expert said			0
there 's also an extremely rare picture taken by @entity27 showing his fellow explorer @entity9 on the lunar surface			1
most of the photos from the @entity38 landing were taken by @entity9 himself , so there are very few of him actually on the @entity10			1
" it is very rare to find a vintage print of that because it was n't recognized by @entity5 at the time , " explained the @entity19 spokesman			2
" they did n't realize it was @entity9 , so they did n't release it to the press			0
it was found years later , and very few people have seen it , it has n't been widely published , so that one is of obvious historic significance			0
" but the collection is not limited to photos from the 1960s heyday of the space program			0
the oldest image in the sale is one dating all the way back to 1946 ; shot by a camera strapped to a v - 2 rocket , it is the first to show the earth from space			0
in addition to photos of astronauts , there are also landmark mosaics and panoramas showing the lunar surface , and shots looking back at @entity95 from the darkness of space , including the iconic " @entity106 " image taken by @entity99 's @entity100 in december 1968 , which @entity101 , head of photographs at @entity19 , said " changed man 's relationship with the cosmos forever			0
" the auction house spokesman said previous sales of @entity5 images had proved hugely popular , both with space enthusiasts and photography aficionados			1
" four years ago in 2011 we sold a private collection of @entity5 photos and i was surprised by the range of people who did buy them -- i 'd say about half were interested in the aesthetics of the image , and the other half were looking for the significant moments in space history -- the classic images : the first ' earthrise ' , the first picture of the whole earth and so on			1
" he said the fact that the pictures were vintage prints , dating back to the days of the space race only added to their allure			2
" they represent a golden age in the history of photography , when a few men went to the unknown to bring back awe - inspiring pictures , " said @entity101			0
