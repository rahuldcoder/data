-- @entity2 's dressage dominance was recognized wednesday evening in her native @entity3 as " the girl with the @entity5 " was named the @entity7 & @entity6			1
@entity2 , who earned her nickname back home after her heroics at @entity11 , enjoyed a 2014 to remember as the @entity12 and @entity14 champion became a world champion to consolidate her place at the summit of the sport			1
the 29 - year - old -- riding @entity20 gelding @entity22 -- claimed two individual gold medals in the special and freestyle events , as well as a team silver , at the @entity26 in @entity27 earlier this year , while she also became the first ever @entity28 to win the @entity30 dressage title in @entity31 in april			1
the achievements of @entity2 -- she is the first rider in history to hold all the major titles in dressage -- are all the more remarkable given that she only began competing on the tour three years ago			1
" if someone had asked me ' do you think that 's possible ? ' i would have been like ' absolutely not , ' " @entity2 told @entity0 in september after achieving the " grand slam			1
" " for it to have been possible and that i 've actually done it is very surreal and something that i always have to think ' oh my @entity44 ! ' i 've won all of it			0
there 's no more i can do			0
" @entity2 first became a @entity14 champion back in 2011 , winning team gold in @entity50 , before following that up two years later in @entity51 with two individual gold medals in the special and freestyle events			1
sandwiched in between those triumphs came her team and individual @entity12 gold medals in @entity56 -- the moment when she really first caught the @entity3 public 's imagination			2
" i remember going into the local supermarket and i got spotted by a guy going ' @entity62 you 're the girl with the dancing horse ! ' he goes , ' i know nothing about horses but i watched you on the telly , ' " @entity2 recalls			2
" if you say you do dressage and the dancing horses ... nine times out of 10 people recognize our sport now			0
" none of the fame and success would have been possible without @entity22 , though , according to @entity2 , who has been with her every step of the way			2
" he 's not just a horse to me , he truly is my best friend			0
one day i want him to pull my car when i get married , " @entity2 says			0
" that 's what i want do with him			0
he 'll be strong enough to do that			0
" @entity2 saw off strong competition in winning the accolade , with @entity12 skeleton gold medalist @entity91 taking second place and athlete @entity93 , who won @entity14 gold in the 10,000 meters at the age of 40 , coming third			1
gymnast @entity96 won the young sportswoman award following her four golds at the @entity99 in @entity100 .			0
