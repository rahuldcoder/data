@entity0 , @entity1 -- at a debate in front of thousands of labor union activists tuesday , sen. @entity5 's @entity4 presidential rivals blasted him for his remarks about @entity10			1
last wednesday , the @entity1 senator said that if it were necessary to root out terrorists , he would send @entity15 forces into @entity10 without the country 's approval			2
" you can think big , but remember , you should n't always say everything you think if you 're running for president , because it has consequences around the world , " sen. @entity18 said during a 90 - minute @entity4 presidential forum in @entity0 sponsored by the @entity20			1
@entity0 is @entity5 's hometown , and @entity28 's statement drew boos			1
the @entity31 senator responded , " we do n't need that right now			0
" despite the frosty reception , @entity34 sen. @entity33 joined @entity28 in criticizing @entity5			1
he said @entity5 's stance could undermine @entity10 president @entity37 , the country 's military ruler , who has been a @entity15 ally in the fight against @entity40			1
" while general @entity37 is no @entity41 , he may be the only thing that stands between us and having an @entity45 fundamentalist state in that country , " @entity33 said			2
" so while i would like to see him change , the reality is , if we lose him , then what we face is an alternative that could be a lot worse for our country			0
" @entity5 jumped into the fray			0
" i find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism , " he said			0
" if we have actionable intelligence on @entity40 operatives , including [ @entity68 ] @entity68 , and president @entity37 can not act , then we should , " @entity5 said			2
" that 's just common sense			0
" he also said @entity15 had the right to participate in the debate over such a key aspect of @entity15 foreign policy			2
but @entity28 countered by saying that while @entity15 forces might have to pursue action inside @entity10 " on the basis of actionable intelligence , " it was " a very big mistake to telegraph that and to destabilize the @entity37 regime , which is fighting for its life against the @entity85 extremists who are in bed with @entity40 and the @entity87			1
" " remember , @entity10 has nuclear weapons			0
the last thing we want is to have @entity40 - like followers in charge of @entity10 and having access to nuclear weapons			0
" sen. @entity95 of @entity96 responded later in the debate , noting that the strategy @entity5 outlined was already @entity15 policy			1
" everyone 's entitled to their own opinion , but not their own facts , " @entity95 said			0
" it 's already the policy of the @entity15 -- has been for four years -- that there 's actionable intelligence , we would go into @entity10			1
