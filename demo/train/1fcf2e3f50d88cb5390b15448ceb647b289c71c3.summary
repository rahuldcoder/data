the conflict raging in @entity1 is different this time			2
while @entity4 ' rocket attacks and @entity6 's military actions may look familiar , they 're taking place against a whole new backdrop			1
" this is unprecedented in the history of the arab - israeli conflict , " says @entity10 's @entity9 , an analyst who has covered the region for decades			2
" most arab states are actively supporting @entity6 against the @entity15 -- and not even shy about it or doing it discreetly			1
" it 's a " joint @entity17 - @entity6 war consisting of @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 against other @entity17 -- the @entity15 as represented by @entity4			1
" as the @entity22 put it , " @entity17 leaders , viewing @entity4 as worse than @entity6 , stay silent			2
" one of the outcomes of the fighting will likely be " the end of the old @entity17 alliance system that has , even nominally , supported the @entity15 and their goal of establishing a @entity15 state , " @entity9 says			0
" the @entity6 - @entity4 conflict has laid bare the new divides of the @entity36 , " says @entity30 , vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the @entity33			1
" it 's no longer the @entity38 against the @entity39			0
now it 's the extremists -- the @entity42 , @entity4 , @entity43 , and their backers @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 -- against @entity6 and the more moderate @entity38 including @entity19 , @entity18 , and @entity20			1
" " it 's a proxy war for control or dominance in the @entity36 , " says @entity10 's @entity48			1
to understand why and what all this means , we need to begin with understanding of @entity4			2
@entity4 and the @entity42 @entity4 , which has controlled the @entity15 government in @entity1 for years , is an extension of the @entity42			1
to many @entity59 , the brotherhood is familiar for its central role in the power struggle for @entity18			0
but it 's much larger than that			0
" the @entity42 is international , with affiliated groups in more than 70 countries , including @entity20 and the @entity68 , " says @entity64 of the @entity65			2
the @entity69 showed the region that uprisings can lead to the @entity42 gaining power			0
so it 's a threat to the governments it opposes			0
" @entity6 's ongoing battle against @entity4 is part of a wider regional war on the @entity42 , " says the @entity76 , which tracks global security			1
" most @entity17 states share @entity6 's determination to finish the movement off once and for all , but they are unlikely to be successful			1
" " from the perspective of @entity18 , @entity20 , @entity19 , the @entity68 and some other @entity17 states , what the @entity6 prime minister is doing is fighting this war against @entity4 on their behalf so they can finish the last stronghold of the @entity42 , " @entity9 says			1
" @entity17 governments and official @entity17 media have all but adopted the @entity6 view of who is a terrorist and who is not			2
@entity18 and @entity20 - owned media are liberal in labeling the @entity42 as ' terrorists ' and describing @entity4 as a ' terrorist organization			1
' it 's a complete turnabout from the past , when @entity17 states fought @entity6 and the @entity59 in the international organizations on the definition of terrorism , and who is a terrorist or a ' freedom fighter			2
' " @entity18 @entity18 's new president vowed during his campaign that he would finish off the @entity42			1
@entity107 , the former military chief , deposed @entity18 's first freely elected leader , president @entity108 of the @entity42 , last year following mass protests against @entity108 's rule			1
@entity107 was elected officially in june			0
" in @entity18 you have a regime that came to power by toppling a @entity42 government , " says @entity64			2
" it 's therefore in an existential conflict with the @entity42			2
so it does n't want to see @entity4 , the @entity15 @entity42 , emerge stronger in a neighboring territory			2
" @entity18 also has another reason to stand against @entity4 : rising violence and instability in @entity122 , the northern part of @entity18 that borders @entity6 and @entity1			1
@entity4 ' network of tunnels includes some in and out of @entity18 used to smuggle goods include weapons for attackson @entity6 civilians			1
the new @entity18 government has been " cracking down aggressively since it removed the brotherhood from power , " @entity64 says			0
@entity107 closed the border crossings between @entity18 and @entity1 , which has helped block @entity4 militants from escaping or smuggling in more weapons during @entity6 's onslaught			1
but it also has contributed to the humanitarian crisis of people trapped in @entity1			0
@entity18 proposed a cease - fire , and @entity6 quickly accepted it -- indicating that it contained the terms @entity6 was looking for , analysts say			1
while @entity18 has worked furiously to try to broker a truce in the past , @entity145 this time shows little rush to change its proposal to one much more favorable to @entity4 , analysts say			1
@entity20 , @entity68 , @entity19 the monarchies of @entity20 , the @entity68 and @entity19 have called on @entity4 to accept the cease - fire proposal as is			1
" we condemn the @entity6 aggression and we support the @entity18 cease - fire proposal , " @entity19 's @entity151 said last week			1
countries such as @entity20 and the @entity68 are " challenged by @entity154 who come to power via the ballot box rather than through royal succession , " says @entity64			0
" so these countries have been directly supportive of the coup in @entity18 because it removed elected @entity154 and therefore discredited that model			0
" @entity20 is " leading the charge , " partly through backing the coup and financing state media reports that attacked the brotherhood , says @entity166			0
" @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity68 all see the destruction of @entity4 as of benefit to their internal security as well as to regional stability			1
" " the @entity20 and the @entity18 are now more scared of @entity154 fundamentalism than they are of @entity6 , " says @entity48			1
" the @entity20 monarchy is more worried about the prospects of @entity4 winning , which would embolden @entity154 in other parts of the @entity36 , and therefore potentially an @entity177 opposition in @entity20			1
" but @entity4 is not alone			0
@entity47 and @entity46 @entity47 and @entity46 remain supportive of @entity4			1
@entity46 supported @entity18 's @entity42 government , and built " an @entity18 - centric @entity180 network that became known for its strongly pro-muslim @entity42 line , " says @entity64			1
@entity46 also funds many @entity42 figures in exile , including @entity4 political leader @entity184 , who is believed to have orchestrated numerous @entity4 terrorist attacks			1
" i think this is a case of a country with a lot of money to burn making a certain calculation in 2011 that made a lot of sense at the time : that the @entity42 was the next big thing that was going to dominate many of the countries of the region , " says @entity64			0
" realistically , it made sense to bet on it			0
" @entity47 has " more of an ideological sympathy with the @entity42 , " he says			2
last week , @entity47 prime minister @entity202 spoke with @entity10 , accusing @entity6 of " genocide			2
" " @entity202 has tried to use the cause of the @entity42 to bolster his own @entity177 credentials at home , " says @entity64			0
last year , @entity202 cracked down on mass demonstrations in his country			0
@entity45 and @entity209 @entity45 has long supported @entity4 , supplying it with weapons			0
and @entity211 used to be based in @entity209			0
in 2012 , @entity211 left @entity209 as the country 's civil war deepened -- a decision believed to have caused a breakdown in his relationship with @entity45 as well , says @entity218 , head of @entity36 and @entity219 and forecasting at the global information company @entity221			2
@entity222 is aligned with @entity209 president @entity224 's regime			0
now , @entity209 -- @entity6 's neighbor to the north -- is locked in a brutal , multiparty civil war , with @entity177 extremists hoisting severed heads onto poles			1
the war , believed to have killed more than 115,000 people , is just one of the many developments emphasizing how many " fault lines " there are in the region , @entity231 , president of @entity232 , told " @entity240			0
" " there 's fault lines within the @entity15 between @entity4 and the other part of the @entity244			2
you have @entity45 vs. @entity20 and the @entity17			0
you have secularists vs. people who embrace religion in the political space			0
" the @entity244 paying a price for all this is another key player : @entity254 , the @entity15 faction that controls the @entity255			0
@entity254 and @entity4 have long fought each other , but earlier this year made another effort at a unity government			0
@entity15 leader @entity264 , who is in charge of the government in the @entity255 , " seems politically exhausted by all the twists and turns he has made in search of a durable solution , " the @entity259 says			0
" and the one chance of reasserting his authority through a unity government that would have forced @entity4 into a subordinate and less militant role has now disappeared			0
he must now watch helplessly as protests in the @entity255 undo whatever progress he had made towards a two - state solution			0
" @entity1 conflict by the numbers			1

the @entity1 conflict is a proxy war for the @entity36 , analysts say
@entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 are seen as supporting @entity6 's *crackdown* on @entity4
@entity47 and @entity46 support @entity4
@entity4 is an extension of the @entity42 , which threatens some governments
