@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 @entity2 is @entity5 and he knows that the @entity7 's racial reckoning wo n't come from 100 - page reports from party headquarters with carefully worded prescriptions about " outreach " to " demographic partners			1
" instead , the type of sea change needed to shake the @entity7 's image as a party of old , white and culturally - insulated men will require the type of profound grassroots shakeup that might make some in the @entity7 uneasy			1
" you got your establishment @entity24 who want to keep things the same , " said @entity2 , an @entity20 veteran who grew up in @entity21 during the @entity22			0
" the status quo needs to go through some , i wo n't say diversity classes , but i 'll say liberty classes and learn about helping people on the bottom of the ladder			0
" he said the party also has to deal with small but noisy elements that co-opt any message of inclusiveness if it wants to win the " propaganda battle			2
" full @entity40 coverage when @entity2 , founder of the @entity24 , tried to share his message while leading a panel at last weekend 's @entity40 in @entity43 , he found himself face to face with that fringe			0
@entity2 said one young attendee said @entity46 , an abolitionist , should have thanked his slave masters for giving him food and shelter and that segregation was n't such a bad policy			2
the @entity52 knows it has major work ahead as it tries to make inroads with racial minorities , young voters and women			1
the group released a 100 - page report analyzing its losses in the 2012 presidential election as well as seats in the @entity63			2
@entity7 presidential nominee @entity64 lost big among @entity65 , african - americans and @entity67			1
" the report notes the way we communicate our principles is n't resonating widely enough , " @entity52 chairman @entity68 said			2
" focus groups described our party as ' narrow - minded , ' ' out of touch , ' and ' stuffy old men			0
' " " it all goes back to what our moms used to tell us : it 's not just what we say ; it 's how we say it , " @entity68 continued			0
@entity24 want to change perception of ' stuffy old men ' @entity64 's hardline stance on immigration , including his endorsement of a policy of " self - deportation , " may be one reason why he won just 27 % of @entity91 voters -- a lower percentage than the last two @entity7 presidential candidates			1
but @entity64 is n't the only @entity4 politician who has used that type of rhetoric			1
similar comments from other @entity7 politicians coupled with the occasional pronouncements of president @entity100 as " lazy " helps to cement for minorities an impression of the @entity4 as out of touch and out of sync with minority communities , said @entity106 , an associate professor of political science at @entity108 in @entity109			1
outreach and naming minorities to committee positions is great , @entity106 said , but the party has much harder work ahead			1
party leaders will have to work to better understand the minority groups they are reaching out to			1
in the case of african - americans and @entity65 , that will mean recognizing the fact that a strong sense of " linked fate " means many members of this group may be loathe to take a hardline position on cutting entitlement programs , immigration or changing the @entity127 because someone they know may be adversely affected , @entity106 said			2
" if prominent @entity24 are signing amicus briefs supporting dismantling affirmative action , african - americans and @entity65 will have a problem with that , " @entity106 said			0
she added that the @entity7 also wo n't win broader minority support " in the budget talks advocating dismantling programs that disproportionately help people of color while keeping programs that are perceived in helping the well off			1
" " it 's going to take some platform changes , " @entity106 said			0
" the identity politics they decry is something minorities hold dear			0
that 's a compromise some people will be unwilling to make			0
" the @entity52 report underscored this point			0
opinion : @entity7 has power where it counts - the states " if @entity91 @entity154 perceive that a @entity7 nominee or candidate does not want them in the @entity154 , they will not pay attention to our next sentence , " it states			1
in one of its few policy recommendations , the report counsels @entity24 to " embrace and champion " comprehensive immigration reform			1
@entity165 , a veteran @entity7 strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980 , put it more bluntly			2
" token efforts , such as tamale parties , will no longer work , " @entity165 told @entity1 last year			0
" @entity170 will require more than outreach			0
" " latinos , african - americans and people of other races must be represented in the important decision - making strategies of any given campaign , whether it be for a @entity181 or @entity4			2
" for his part , @entity2 holds out hope that the @entity7 's attempts to bring more minorities into the @entity186 will align the party 's views with those of @entity46 , his personal hero who he says shared @entity4 values			1
but he 's looking for more than platitudes about inclusiveness			0
the party , @entity2 said , has got to tie principles about self - reliance and getting weaned off government dependence to efforts to help people become entrepreneurs and gain a stronger economic foothold			0
" the @entity4 has to be sincere , otherwise the outcome is not going to work and it 's going to fail , " @entity2 said			1
5 things @entity203 : new faces , old music and winners / losers			0

@entity4 outreach to minority cited as a priority in new report
the @entity7 will have to work hard to gain trust , voters in minority communities
previous @entity7 policy positions on immigration , entitlements a *hurdle* for some minorities
some platform changes may be needed in order to win over more minority voters
