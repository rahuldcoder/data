editor 's note : @entity2 is a member of the @entity4 editorial board and a nationally syndicated columnist			1
@entity2 says hate crimes should be punished severely because they 're aimed at society as a whole			1
@entity10 , @entity11 ( @entity12 ) -- to think there are some people who still argue that the law should n't categorize some offenses as hate crimes and allow for enhanced criminal penalties			1
they claim that all sorts of crimes are motivated by hate , and to separate some from others elevates some victims over others and amounts to the state policing thoughts and feelings			1
they also fear that politicians and institutions are simply yielding to political correctness , liberal pressure groups and identity politics			2
my view is that hate crimes deserve special punishment because they do n't just victimize whoever they 're aimed at ; they 're intended to send a message , and they terrorize the whole society			1
that debate might have been settled wednesday at the @entity39 , where hate was on display			1
a shooting left one man dead : @entity44 , a six - year veteran of the museum 's security staff who , according to museum director @entity50 , " died heroically in the line of duty			2
" the alleged assailant is @entity52 , a @entity54 denier who created an anti-semitic web site			2
the 88 - year - old often challenged the authenticity of " @entity59 , " the book about a teenage girl living in @entity62 during the @entity64 occupation of the @entity65			2
so it was probably no coincidence that the shooting occurred on the same day the museum had scheduled a play based on a fictional meeting between @entity72 and @entity73 , a martyr of the civil rights movement			2
@entity44 also had longstanding ties to white supremacist groups , according to authorities			0
these outfits flourish in bad times because they give underperformers something really valuable : convenient scapegoats for their troubles , failures and shortcomings			0
without that , these misfits might actually have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for their own lives			0
although these groups are properly categorized as " hate groups " by organizations such as the @entity95 , what also fuels them are things like fear and insecurity			1
nowadays , their targets are often @entity103 , especially immigrants			1
but , before that and for much of the history of this country , the targets have been @entity109			1
and , for much of the history of the world , they have been @entity112			1
and that prejudice has n't gone away			0
consider what the rev. @entity117 , the former @entity118 , @entity119 , pastor whose relationship with @entity116 became an issue in the presidential election , recently told the @entity124 newspaper , the @entity123 , when asked if he speaks to @entity116			1
" them @entity112 are n't going to let him talk to me , " @entity117 said in an apparent reference to some of @entity116 's aides			1
@entity117 later said he misspoke and meant to refer to " zionists			0
" a researcher for the @entity95 has said her group had a thick file on @entity52 going back 20 years and that he had become a " hardcore neo-nazi			0
" @entity44 blamed a six - year prison term he once served -- for the attempted kidnapping of @entity138 board members in 1981 -- on " a @entity140 jury , " " jew / @entity140 attorneys " and " a jew judge , " according to his web site			0
in documents read at trial , @entity52 wrote that his goal was to " deport all jews and blacks from the white nations			2
" also , on his web site , there 's a message lamenting how " bit by bit government institutions and @entity154 fell into jew hands -- then @entity39 diplomacy , businesses , resources and manpower came under @entity112 control			1
" you get the picture			0
it 's no mystery what this guy is , to anyone but himself			0
his court - appointed lawyer from the @entity138 case said @entity52 , a veteran , considers himself a patriot			0
he 's no such thing			0
that concept is best defined as love for one 's country , not hatred for everyone else			0
it 's also obvious that , while @entity109 are always in a hurry to close our most unpleasant chapters , anti-semitism is alive and well in parts of our society			2
like its equally vile cousins -- racism and nativism -- it thrives because many people are threatened by change and eager to cast others as villains			0
meanwhile , president @entity116 said the museum shooting " reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-semitism and prejudice in all its forms			1
" so true , mr. president			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203			0

@entity2 : hate crimes should be punished more severely
he says hate crimes terrorize society as a whole
@entity2 : latinos , blacks and @entity112 have all been targets of haters
he says @entity116 is right to urge *constant* vigilance against hate
