-- when @entity2 dips his toes in a pool of water , he does so in the knowledge he may well be the first man on the planet to do so			1
as he lowers himself below the surface of the ocean in his diving gear he becomes something of a fish whisperer , an underwater pied piper			2
in short , marine life flocks to the pony - tailed @entity15			1
" it 's an amazing experience to see fish that have never seen humans , " he says			1
" they come really , really close to us			2
that 's just unthinkable where people are fishing			1
normally , we 're used to them swimming away from us			2
" what we 're doing is hard to do almost anywhere in the world			0
we 're seeing large fish and sharks in almost every dive			0
people could spend years in , say , the @entity32 and see less sharks than we can in just one single dive			0
this latest trip has been a really , really special experience			1
it 's so wild and we expected to see healthy reefs but not like this			2
" @entity2 is a novelty -- well , certainly to sea life -- with his passion for untouched waters as @entity44 's explorer - in - residence , whose mission is to help protect the last wild places in the ocean			1
the society 's " @entity51 " initiative has been set up to fend off the long - distance fishing fleets that have started to encroach in these remote waters			1
just 2 % of the world 's waters are protected , and @entity2 knows he has a gargantuan task ahead of him that needs massive backing by the world 's governments			1
slowly but surely he is chipping away at ensuring a better future for the world 's waters			1
of the eight areas he has so far visited under the program , four are now protected with a further two currently pending protection			0
his most recent expedition is to @entity67 , an archipelago that separated from @entity68 60 - 85 million years ago , coming to rest 1,210 kilometers east , and is now a special collectivity of @entity70 at the behest of @entity72 , who ordered his navy to take formal possession of the 18,500 @entity75			1
a day 's boat ride north from @entity67 's most northern tip , the @entity77 research vessel has , until recently , been bobbing for the last three weeks slowly on the water 's surface			1
a team of 12 people , made up of scientists , cameramen and crew , with @entity2 at the epicenter as expedition leader			1
previously an academic , he recalls : " i was studying the effects of humans on the ocean			2
i thought saving the ocean was a lost battle but then i decided i wanted to be part of the solution , so we started the @entity100 project			1
" now i feel like there 's hope			1
now i go to these places and see what it used to be like , to see what the future could be elsewhere with regeneration			0
" @entity2 's passion for all things underwater is addictive , he talks with a childlike enthusiasm for his current expedition			1
he was a boy when first captivated by the magic of the sea , inspired by the famous former diver and explorer @entity116			1
" since i can remember , my dream was to be a diver on his boat but i was born too late for that			0
but now i 'm getting to do something similar myself			0
he showed us a lot and in later years showed us what was wrong with what we were doing			0
i 'm trying to go one step beyond that and find solutions			0
" so how would his idol have perceived what @entity2 and his team are now doing ? " i think he would have been proud of what we 're doing , " says @entity2 , who grew up on the @entity136 @entity135 coast			1
" if he had lived on , i think he would have done something like this himself			0
but he was just an amazing man known by so many people around the world			0
" @entity2 's current quest is aimed at not just protecting certain waters but regenerating those that have been fished to within an inch of their lives			1
the aim is to ensure protected areas become increasingly rich in fish and other underwater life , thereby spilling into other waters as it becomes overly abundant , thus in the long - term having a positive knock - on effect to fishermen			1
but he and his team are also learning about healthy coral and reef , among other things , to learn how to help regenerate damaged varieties in other global waters			2
their days are spent diving , filming , photographing and researching			0
@entity2 , indeed , is most at home in the ocean			1
" once in the water , all the problems on the surface disappear , " he insists			0
" you 're in a world where you 're in complete focus but also at peace			0
it 's a world where you do n't feel the strong gravity from the planet , you feel like you 're flying			2
" it completely changes your perspective on the world			0
i think it probably helps that endorphins are being released especially in these pristine places			0
" being able to experience nature , and raw nature at that , first hand is like going back in the past			0
on these trips , it 's like i go into a time machine and go back			2
" sharks have become synonymous with fear in the sea , thanks in part to @entity201 's " @entity206 " film with @entity203 ' ominous stringed musical buildup to each unwitting victim of a shark attack			2
but @entity2 's experience of the underwater predators has been the complete antithesis			1
" every moment is wonderful , like spending just one dive following clown fish for the whole dive , " he says			0
" all the animals are special but the most special are sharks			0
" they are just so beautiful and elegant in the water			0
they 're perfect in their environment and their shape has not really changed in 300 million years			2
" they are also great for the health of the reef , and the idea that they are dangerous is wrong			0
they have a bad reputation but in my five years doing this , diving sharks , i 've not had one problem			0
i 've never once been threatened by sharks			0
" his long - term aim , and that of @entity44 , is to protect 20 seas in total			1
so how exactly can you protect large swathes of water ? " it 's become much easier as governments who we 've worked with pass laws limiting the areas that can be fished , " he explains			2
" obviously some of these are in remote waters so the best way to do that is via satellite			2
for example in @entity67 , we found out that the @entity253 had intercepted an illegal @entity255 fishing vessel			1
having a naval presence is also a great deterrent			0
" next on his tick list is @entity260 in april			0
slowly , sea by sea he is clearing up the planet 's waters , and he is determined to continue .			1

@entity2 , @entity44 's explorer - in - residence , is aiming to clean up the seas
his latest mission took him to relatively *unknown* waters off @entity67
as a child he was inspired by the work of *prestigious* explorer @entity116
previously he thought all hope was lost to restoring the seas , he has since changed his mind
