-- before the world reaches a conclusion as to the outcome of @entity5 , it 's important to understand that the details are far too limited for drawing a parallel to @entity8			1
implying that the airplane disappeared suggests it vanished into thin air			1
at this point , the @entity11 has simply not been found , but the search is in its infancy compared with the months of searching since @entity16 's @entity15 went missing in march			1
a crucial difference in the @entity19 event is that the airplane had been in constant radar contact , at least from the information provided thus far			1
radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path , altitude and direction the @entity11 followed			1
this will assist in more accurately defining the search area			1
with @entity31 370 , radar data was sketchy ; satellite data has been the primary source in determining the track and thus the search area			1
although it appears @entity37 flew through a large area of convective weather , this fact might have been a contributing cause and not the only cause of the event			1
no matter how obvious it might appear , airplane incidents and accidents generally involve more than one factor			1
any good accident investigator will tell you that it is important not to focus on one theory until all the facts have been ascertained			1
so what could have occurred ? no doubt , the crew was attempting to circumnavigate thunderstorm cells through the use of sophisticated on - board weather radar			2
on occasion , deviating around storm activity becomes a matter of determining the path that has a lower probability of turbulence encounters			2
airline pilots always attempt complete avoidance , steering a wide berth around thunderstorms			2
unfortunately , route restrictions , other aircraft traffic and altitude constraints sometimes prevent our flights from deviating as far as we 'd like			2
this is n't to say we jeopardize safety , only that we might not be able to provide the most comfortable conditions for flying			2
experience dictates much of the decision process that airline pilots use to deviate around convective weather			2
operation of the radar itself can be an art with respect to adjusting the tilt angle and intensity the antenna reflects on the display screen			0
although airliners are structurally designed to withstand turbulence , intentional flight into a thunderstorm is never an option			0
and let 's not be misled by the reported request of @entity19 asking air traffic control for a higher altitude			1
this request may not have been an indication of a problem			0
oftentimes , a request for a higher altitude is to provide a smoother ride			0
yes , it is possible to " top " a thunderstorm cell , but most airline pilots attempt to turn away from the weather because turbulence can still be encountered above a building storm cell			0
but there may be other contributing factors to the possible loss of @entity5 8501			0
investigators will want to know whether the pitot tubes that provide airspeed data to the cockpit computer systems froze as a result of a heater failure , similar to the circumstances with @entity119			0
erroneous airspeed data would send confusing information to the instrument panel displays			0
because of the confusing information , pilots would have difficulty reacting			0
it is also possible that the airplane flew through heavy precipitation , flaming out both engines			0
although the @entity11 is designed to continue flying without engine power , being able to control it at high altitude would be a challenge , especially in turbulent conditions			0
if the airplane flew to the limits of its capabilities in regard to altitude , the difference between maximum airspeed and its lowest airspeed would have been a very small margin			0
perhaps a high altitude stall occurred and the airplane never recovered			0
regardless of any speculation , it is much too early for theories			1
for the moment , i am keeping my fingers crossed that a search and rescue operation will find survivors			1
bigger miracles have occurred .			0

@entity155 : it 's *premature* to compare missing @entity37 plane *wto* @entity8
search for @entity161 plane has just begun ; it 's been nine months since @entity8 disappeared
he says it 's far too early to draw any conclusions
