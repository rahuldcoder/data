-- our dog @entity1 loves the holiday season			1
ham for @entity8 and pot roast for @entity10 's			2
with so much food moving around the house and visitors who generously -- and covertly -- feed her under the table , @entity1 has always been a happy dog during the season of giving			1
two reluctant reindeer : @entity1 , left , and @entity19			0
after we spent much of one holiday season at the animal emergency center trying to keep @entity1 alive , our holiday celebration turned into a hunt for household toxics			1
@entity1 was diagnosed with severe anemia , which could have been caused by any one of numerous toxic items found in the refrigerators , cupboards and medicine cabinets of most homes			1
now , @entity1 's kibble and treats practically need their own passport to reach her mouth ; human food is out of reach ; visitors are asked to put away any medications and shown where the " approved " treats are kept			1
it may sound extreme , but veterinary medical experts say this type of preventative behavior can keep pets safe			1
this is especially true during the holidays , when family chaos increases and your pet 's environment may change from day to day with the arrival of family and friends bearing gifts , holiday food items and exotic plants			1
" dogs and cats do not know what is bad for them , " said dr. @entity58 , associate professor and veterinary clinical toxicologist at the @entity60 in @entity61			1
" if there is medicine on the bathroom counter or food left on the table , that is irresistible to them			1
" and unless your houseguests are conscientious pet owners themselves , chances are they are n't aware that they may be creating a toxic environment for your pet			1
@entity58 says it is important to let guests know not to leave their medications in an open suitcase or otherwise exposed			0
over-the - counter and prescription medications can kill small animals			0
because metabolic systems vary between species , a drug that may alleviate pain in humans can easily induce a toxic reaction in a dog or cat			2
for example , ibuprofen ingested by a dog can cause gastrointestinal damage and kidney dysfunction			0
cats are especially susceptible to even small amounts of acetaminophen ( the active ingredient in @entity103 ) ; ingestion of just one tablet can result in anemia and potential liver damage			0
dr. @entity108 , a veterinarian at the @entity109 in @entity110 , says that many of the emergency calls he receives involve pets that have accidentally ingested prescription medications or been given an over-the - counter medication by well - meaning owners who believe that their animal is in pain			1
@entity108 says these calls increase significantly over the holidays			0
" dogs will eat almost anything , " @entity108 said , " and there is no such thing as a dog - proof cap			2
" take care in the kitchen , too			0
typical holiday staples such as grapes and raisins have been shown to cause renal failure when ingested by dogs			1
although small amounts of onions and garlic are often used in pet foods and treats to add flavor , ingestion of large amounts can cause severe red blood cell damage ; cats are especially sensitive			0
macadamia nuts can cause a short - term hind - limb paralysis , and bread dough , if eaten before baking , can expand rapidly once ingested and cause ethanol poisoning			1
sweets , gum and hard candies are often problematic depending on ingredients			0
chocolate contains a theobromine , a chemical that can affect the heart , kidneys and central nervous system			0
dark chocolate and baker 's chocolate contain higher concentrations of theobromine and are more toxic than similar amounts of milk chocolate			2
sugar - free gums and candies that contain the sugar - substitute xylitol can lead to quick onset of toxic clinical signs that may include a rapid decrease in blood sugar and possible seizures			2
think carefully before placing mistletoe or holly in low - lying areas , but put poinsettias anywhere you like			2
the effects of the poinsettia , long believed poisonous , are generally benign , says dr. @entity178 , author of a guide to @entity180 and professor of clinical sciences and toxicology at @entity184 of @entity185 and @entity186			0
exposed plant bulbs such as @entity188 and all species of lilies should be placed out of reach of pets not only during the holidays but year - round , @entity178 says			1
@entity195 in cats can reach critical levels almost immediately after ingestion and lead to acute kidney failure within 48 hours or less			2
" lilies are one of the most poisonous houseplants that exists , " @entity178 said			0
" it 's not just the flower but also the leaves			0
... if a cat eats any part of the plant , it would need to be treated immediately			0
" what should you do if your pet ingests a toxic holiday treat ? " do not wait , " @entity108 said			1
" most people wait too long to call us , and that reduces our options for treatment			0
" @entity108 recommends calling a local veterinarian or animal emergency hospital first , or the @entity222 national animal poison control center ( 888 - 426 - 4435 )			1
the @entity222 charges a $ 60 veterinary consultation fee , but information about toxins is free on the @entity222 web site			1
@entity58 does not advise calling human poison control centers or attempting to diagnose your pet on the @entity229			1
human poison control " is often not aware of the species differences and could inadvertently give the wrong advice , " @entity58 said			1
" when doing a general internet search , make sure the site is backed by a recognized veterinary organization or veterinary medical school			0
if it is not referenced , it is just someone 's opinion			0
" @entity108 and @entity58 both warn against inducing vomiting in your pet before speaking with a veterinarian			0
getting appropriate background information about the animal is critical to preparing a treatment plan for a particular toxin , they say , and every case -- every animal -- is different			2
@entity1 never recovered from her anemia , but she has been in remission long enough to create another toxic scare			2
after learning that @entity1 had ingested an entire bag of @entity258 's kisses , we called our local animal emergency hospital in @entity260			2
they did a quick calculation using @entity1 's weight to determine whether a one - pound bag of milk chocolate would reach toxic levels in a dog of her size			1
it would not , but we were forced to clean up the silver - streaked evidence for many days afterwards			0
@entity271 is a former journalist for @entity272 , @entity0 and the @entity273			0
she is a second - year student in the professional veterinary program at @entity184 .			0
