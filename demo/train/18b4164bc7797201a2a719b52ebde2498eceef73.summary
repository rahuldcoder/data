-- @entity1 will be singing @entity3 's " f -- you " on " glee " in two weeks , @entity4 confirmed			1
i maintain this is a better song for mr. @entity9 , but i 'm officially curious			2
perhaps it will be country strong ! the song is going to be sanitized to " forget you , " which is so substantially less catchy , and seeing the world 's poshest human sing about not being able to afford a @entity14 will provide some interesting cultural dissonance			1
but there 's a part of me that thinks this could be kind of adorable ? if she is all sassy and campy about it ? and it 's sort of joke - y ? hm			0
