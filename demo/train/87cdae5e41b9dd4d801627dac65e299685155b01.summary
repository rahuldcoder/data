@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 clutched a mahogany rosary and a pair of latex gloves in his left hand , his face covered in a sterile mask			1
he watched intently as two front - end loaders clawed into piles of dirt and dumped it into freshly dug trenches			1
arms , legs , entire bodies flailed and flew before reaching their final resting place			0
the stench of human flesh , decomposing for 17 days , carried with the wind			0
@entity3 took it upon himself to bury the estimated 2,500 bodies here			1
they were mothers , fathers , sons and daughters who were never given a proper burial after they perished in the earthquake that leveled the @entity1 capital of @entity31 on january 12			1
at least 150,000 people died that day , the @entity1 government estimates			1
many of their bodies were dumped here , near the village of @entity38 , about 45 minutes northeast of the capital			1
@entity3 , who owns a car dealership and helps run the @entity1 charity , @entity42 , said he was watching a @entity2 report friday about how many bodies were just left to rot , without proper interment			1
" i was just appalled			0
this is a sacrilege , " he said saturday			0
@entity1 , he said , is a deeply spiritual country with great respect for the dead			1
" this , " he said pointing to the mounds of death , " is countercultural to @entity1 -- the total lack of respect for the dead			1
" @entity54 , @entity1 's minister of information , denied to @entity2 's @entity55 that the dead had been transported out of the city by truck and dumped out of view without burial			1
she said the state - run trucking company @entity62 was " doing a good job " disposing bodies			0
but after seeing footage of the bodies on @entity2 , @entity3 had to do something			1
by 8 a.m. friday , he was on the phone , ordering front - end loaders			0
he asked his welding shop to shape five metal crosses and called bishop @entity71 to come perform last rites			1
@entity71 arrived friday with @entity74 priest @entity73 , a doctor who cares for the poor in @entity1			1
the two sprinkled holy water and said prayers over the freshly dug graves and remaining piles of bodies			2
@entity3 's crew buried about 1,500 people friday			2
the next day , they returned for the remaining 1,000			0
no one knows how many such mounds of bodies exist still in these valleys			0
some are near @entity38 , its grim past now linked with this macabre task			0
this is where the dirty work of politics stooped to its lowest as the bodies of thousands who died under the brutal @entity98 dictatorships were said to have been tossed			0
@entity3 surveyed the land -- rocky dirt and gentle rolling hills that will forever be haunted by restless souls			2
at least , he was able to restore dignity to some of them , though no one will know who is buried here , under the five metal crosses			1
" maybe they are doing them better elsewhere			0
i do n't know , " @entity3 said			2
he did n't want to blame anyone for what happened			0
it 's easy to point fingers at a time of epic tragedy			0
he simply found relief saturday in finding some sense of closure more than two weeks after the devastating earthquake			2
" i 'm very grateful to be able to do this , " he said			2
he asked visiting journalists to refrain from walking the mounds of dirt			0
to not step over the dead			0
it was a tough two days for @entity3			2
but for 2,500 @entity1 , it was grace .			2
