-- as @entity3 approaches , my 10 - year - old daughter is getting excited about choosing a scary costume for trick - or - treating and the prospect of a bucket full of sweets			1
i usually accompany her , but this year has stirred memories of a genuinely spooky encounter , re-awakened by a recent assignment for @entity0			1
the @entity12 is about to release the full 144 - minute version of @entity14 -- 24 minutes more than previously seen in @entity15			1
if you 're of a nervous disposition , the thought of subjecting yourself to additional minutes of what many regard as the most terrifying movie ever made might be a less than appealing one			0
but true horror fans are licking their lips in anticipation			2
the film -- directed by the brilliant @entity27 in 1980 -- is now regarded as a masterclass in movie - making but at the time it was largely received with the scratching of heads and a mood of disappointment			1
@entity27 adapted the film from the book written by horror novelist @entity37 -- and that 's where my connection begins			1
in 1974 @entity37 and his wife stayed at the majestic @entity41 in @entity42 , a small town at the foot of the @entity44			1
the hotel was due to shut down for the winter season and the @entity46 were the only guests in the place , echoing round the long empty corridors and silent ballroom			2
by the time they checked out of @entity53 the next morning -- @entity54 had the bones of his chilling story			0
@entity27 treasures on display i visited @entity42 34 years later and decided to take my family to the @entity41			2
although @entity27 's film was shot at the @entity62 in @entity64 ( exteriors ) and @entity65 near @entity66 ( interiors ) the resemblance is uncanny			1
our guide told us the hotel was inhabited by a number of ghosts , sometimes appearing in photographs as balls of energy			2
the warning was met with a mixture of giggles and suspiciously raised eyebrows			0
we were about to shuffle along another carpeted corridor when my wife gave a cry of surprise : " look at this ! " we gathered round her camera to see an image of the staircase on which were three orbs of light -- different sizes , different opacities , different to anything i 'd ever seen before			1
they had n't appeared to the naked eye nor had they appeared on anyone else 's camera			2
during the rest of the tour our group achieved a degree of minor celebrity by repeating the feat at several other locations within the hotel			2
there was one on the wood - panelled ceiling of the ballroom and later , when we checked back through all the pictures , we discovered that another had appeared on the photograph we took of the reception before meeting or tour guide			1
the images were taken in different places , with very different lighting and of the 200 photographs we took during our holiday no orbs appeared on any other photograph -- nor indeed on any photograph ever taken on that camera before or since			2
we were amused and baffled but promptly forgot about them when we returned to @entity66			0
this month , covering the story of the extended version of @entity14 came my way and while researching it i remembered the photographs			0
so when i went to interview the film 's executive producer @entity133 at his home in the ancient @entity137 city of @entity138 , an hour 's drive north of @entity66 , i took them with me			1
he talked eloquently about @entity27 and his movie			0
" it was a film that shows nothing but ambiguity			0
and this is what @entity27 wanted , " he said			0
i showed him the pictures			0
he seemed amused but like me could offer no plausible explanation			0
they too remain ambiguous and i 'm happy for them to remain so			0
but for some fans of the film , ambiguity leaves a void which must be filled with conspiracy theories			0
some claim to have discovered hidden messages about anything from the @entity160 to the plight of @entity162 , and to @entity27 's apparent use of the film to confess to helping the @entity166 government fabricate the @entity168 moon landings			1
" it 's amazing how this film invited speculation and fantasy in the audience			1
which is good , " said @entity133			1
" it 's a great compliment to @entity27 that people go into orbit about it			0
" " orbit " eh ? is that another deliberate clue ... no , i 'm not going down that road			0
i 'll stick to my own photographs instead			0
and if there is anyone out there with a good theory ( conspiratorial or otherwise ) about those we 'd love to hear from you .			1
