-- as i watched the split screen of the @entity4 hearings and the @entity6 hearings this week , two views of what makes @entity9 great were clearly on display			1
i was transfixed by the visual image of four - star gen. @entity4 , sitting in dress uniform decorated with row upon row of ribbons and patches awarded in recognition for some difficult task or accomplishment			1
the general was given a deserved lovefest by the members of the @entity23			0
the contrast was @entity6 , also called general ( solicitor general ) in her modest suit being put through a little more grueling questioning by the @entity28			0
@entity4 is a hero and the most celebrated active general in our armed services			1
@entity6 is a stranger to most of the country and barely known outside the legal and political fields before her nomination			0
but she will now be an important part of our government and our nation 's history			0
the most serious questioning she received was by the ranking @entity42 , sen. @entity43 , @entity44 , who wanted to know why as dean of the @entity47 she had restricted military recruiters ' ability to contact students on campus because of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy barring openly gay soldiers from serving			1
she did n't have a good answer			2
the honest answer would have been that many in the academic world and many in the legal world do n't like our military			1
assuming she is confirmed , @entity6 will conduct her battles behind the closed doors of the @entity63 -- potentially for many decades -- and i assume she will be part of the liberal wing of the court			0
her battles will be with words and opinions , not bullets			0
@entity4 ' battlefield will be more public and certainly more difficult			1
the @entity4 hearing was pro forma			1
the explanation to his wife about why he was going back to war and moving from @entity78 , @entity79 , to @entity80 , @entity81 , probably took longer than it did for the @entity28 to confirm him			2
@entity4 is doing this because his president asked him to and because he is a soldier and a patriot			1
but there was a mixed message coming out of @entity4 ' hearing			1
the message was : we love you general , we hate your war			1
his message back was : let me go fight it as best i know how and do n't handicap my fighters by artificial deadlines or restrictions			1
after nine years of battle , @entity9 are tired of war			1
do n't think for a moment that our soldiers , from generals on down , are n't pretty tired of it , too			1
the generals and the soldiers did n't start these wars			2
it 's important that @entity9 remember who created the first battlefields and struck the first blows against us at the @entity116 and the @entity117 itself			1
these were the first battlefields on our soil since the @entity121			0
one of the bravest of these generals , is @entity123 , who announced this week he will retire shortly from the @entity124			1
a little over a year ago , he also sat in a decorated uniform before that same @entity23			0
it 's notable that while this great man attracted wide public attention by the manner in which he 's leaving the @entity124 after 34 years of service to his country , few will ever know what he did and the dangers he has encountered			1
most of his military career has been in special operations , the clandestine fighting that is not reported			2
much of his service and his accomplishments remain classified including his tour of duty from 2003 to 2008 as commander of the @entity144			0
this elite unit of @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity150 forces was so covert that the @entity117 refused to acknowledge it existed			0
it was composed of a very few of the best fighting forces we had , and its mission was finding terrorists and eliminating them			0
i would think that , in a war with terrorists , that 's what you want your side to do			2
in the @entity165 article that finished this great warrior 's career , the freelance writer , @entity163 mockingly states , " the general 's staff is a handpicked collection of killers , spies , geniuses , patriots , political operators and outright maniacs			0
" in a war against ruthless terrorists , that sounds like the right team to me			2
altar boys and freelance reporters need not apply			0
in combat with terrorists or any other group trying to kill you , the " @entity187 " rules do not apply			0
unfortunately , very few of our citizens and even fewer of our elected officials have ever served in the military			2
the all - volunteer military is the best fighting force in the world , though the public may not be fully aware of the crucial role it plays			1
generals @entity123 and @entity4 are part of that very special military			1
@entity4 has put himself on the line again			1
failure in @entity81 is defined by the media , the @entity204 , the @entity205 or whoever would taint his extraordinary record in @entity208			0
but it should n't , just as a few words to an overly ambitious reporter should n't damage the reputation , great history and service @entity123 has given his country			1
we should honor and thank @entity123			2
tellingly , he never talked to the media from the time he was a captain until he was a four - star general			0
the @entity219 article reporting his promotion was headlined , " a general steps from the shadows			0
" as he retires and goes back into the shadows , every award , every recognition that he deserves should be given him			0
president @entity226 did the right thing this week by letting him retire as a four - star general			0
the @entity124 and the @entity117 needs to do everything it can to recognize his service to our country			0
duty , honor , country are the words each @entity238 cadet is to live by			0
gen. @entity123 lived by them every day			1
on this @entity241 weekend celebrating our independence as a nation , we need to be grateful to the men and women who over the last 234 years have served in our military to keep us free			2
@entity247 did n't come easily and defending the @entity9 way of life has fallen on the shoulders of our fellow citizens who now voluntarily have taken on the burden of defending those liberties			1
they are not paid well , they are forced to serve in far - off places and spend much time away from their families			0
they do it because they love this country deeply and without reservation			2
we need to say thank you , and we need to never take their service for granted			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			2

@entity270 : senators ' message to @entity4 was we love you , but not your war
he says @entity4 and gen. @entity123 are heroes who deserve to be honored
after nine years of battle , @entity9 public and military are tired of war
@entity270 : we should n't forget @entity9 did n't seek this war but responded when *attacked*
