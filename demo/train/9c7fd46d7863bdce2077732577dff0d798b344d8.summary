-- a @entity2 investigator accused @entity4 police of widespread extrajudicial killings , and called wednesday for the removal of the @entity9 nation 's police commissioner and its attorney general			1
@entity11 called for @entity4 president @entity12 ( pictured ) to fire the police commissioner			1
" killings by the police in @entity4 are systematic , widespread and carefully planned			1
they are committed at will and with utter impunity , " @entity2 special rapporteur @entity11 said in a written statement on his preliminary findings after his visit to the country			1
the @entity4 government said it rejected @entity11 's findings			2
" the government finds it inconceivable that someone who has been in the country for less than ten days can purport to have conducted comprehensive and accurate research on such a serious matter , as to arrive at the recommendations he made , " government spokesman @entity25 said in a written statement			0
he said the government was concerned @entity11 made " such far - reaching conclusions and recommendations on the basis of his interim report , " and said the findings were released without government response			0
@entity11 said he heard " overwhelming " testimony of the killings , which he said occurred regularly			1
the police commissioner and other senior @entity4 police officials denied the accusations , he said			1
the police may kill for personal reasons , for extortion or for ransom , @entity11 said			1
he added , " often they kill in the name of crime control , but in circumstances where they could readily make an arrest			0
he cited as an example @entity56 , 29 , whom he said police shot and killed last month in the capital , @entity59			2
" after a disagreement at a hotel , a police officer stopped the car @entity56 and his brother were in , and ordered @entity56 to handcuff himself			2
when he asked why he was being arrested , @entity56 was shot three times , " @entity65 said in the news release			0
" the only exceptional things about the case were that @entity56 was the son of a former member of parliament , and the incident had been witnessed , " he said			0
@entity11 said there was no accountability for the alleged police killings ; there is no independent police internal affairs unit			1
he called for @entity4 president @entity12 to fire the police commissioner			1
" any serious commitment to ending the impunity that currently reigns in relation to the widespread and systematic killings by the police should begin with the immediate dismissal of the police commissioner			1
in the absence of such a step it will be impossible to conclude that there is a strong commitment at the very top to deal with this problem			0
" as for attorney general @entity93 , @entity11 's comments were severe , and he called for his resignation			1
" mr. @entity93 is the embodiment in @entity4 of the phenomenon of impunity			0
" @entity11 also accused government security forces of torturing and killing hundreds of men in a march 2008 crackdown on a militia in the @entity102			0
@entity104 district , in western @entity4			0
and he said there was compelling evidence that what he called police death squads were operating in @entity59 and @entity110 with a mandate to " exterminate " suspected @entity113 gang members			2
" these are not ' rogue ' squads , but police who are acting on the explicit orders of their superiors , " he said			2
the @entity113 militia , which are loyal to @entity12 's @entity123 tribe , began as a religious sect , but over the years has morphed into a gang that runs protection rackets -- particularly in the slums			0
the @entity2 investigator suggested @entity12 acknowledge the alleged police killings and commit to stop them			1
he also advocated that an independent civilian police oversight body be created , and said the prosecutor of the @entity133 should investigate violence after the 2007 election			2
he also said the government should create a witness protection program			0
@entity11 traveled to @entity4 after the government invited him , staying from february 15 until wednesday			0
he will issue a final report of his findings , but it was not immediately clear when it would be released .			0
