thousands of @entity4 and @entity2 tourists have cancelled trips to each other 's countries			2

@entity8 is @entity2 's fifth - largest carmaker and has a relatively small presence in @entity4			1
but analysts say its problems are shared by other @entity2 groups			0

september and october are the most important months for car sales in @entity4 , heightening the impact on production and profits			2
" @entity4 has become a second source of earnings for the @entity2 auto industry after the @entity80 and @entity82 sentiment there poses serious near - term damage to sales , " @entity71 , a @entity72 - based analyst at @entity63 , said in a recent report that looked at the impact on @entity47 , @entity75 and @entity76 -- @entity2 's biggest carmakers			1
of the three , @entity75 is the most exposed to the @entity4 market and will suffer the biggest financial setback , mr @entity71 said			0
