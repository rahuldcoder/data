@entity0 -- @entity0 officials will begin sifting through soil for human remains tuesday at a site where a part believed to be from one of the 9/11 airliners was found			1
a @entity10 technician confirmed that the piece , discovered last week , is a support structure from a trailing edge flap found on the wing of a @entity10 767 like the ones that were flown into the @entity16 on september 11 , 2001			1
it could not be determined from which of the two planes the part came , police said monday			1
the piece was found in an 18 - inch gap between two buildings near ground zero			2
one of the buildings is 51 @entity25 , the site of a controversial @entity28 community center			2
surveyors who found the piece called authorities to report that they 'd found " apparently damaged machinery , " police said			1
contrary to an initial theory that the piece could have been lowered by a rope found still wrapped to it , the police department clarified monday that a police officer had attached the rope last week to maneuver the part to better see a serial number and other indicators			1
the plane part is about 5 feet long , 4 feet wide and 17 inches deep , police commissioner @entity43 said			1
investigators are still trying to determine how the support structure became wedged into such a small space			2
" if you see how confined this space is , and you realize the chaos that existed on this street , i think it 's understandable			2
it 's not that surprising , " @entity43 said			0
" it 's very , very confined , and no construction work went on , or no clean up went on in this 18 - inch space between the two buildings " after the attacks			0
still identifying 9/11 victims ' remains family members upset some family members of 9/11 victims are outraged by the discovery			1
@entity67 , whose son @entity68 , a probationary firefighter , died when the towers collapsed , said : " i 'm disgusted , because after 9/11 , the proper search was never done			0
the whole aftermath was uncoordinated			0
" @entity67 has been one of the leading voices and , at times , critics for the families of the 9/11 victims , pushing hard for a federal investigation and calling for a more comprehensive search for remains and debris			1
" we advocated for a huge trajectory from that collapse , " she said			0
" human remains were thrown at least for a mile , but probably 2 or 3 miles from the site			1
" police are treating the area as a crime scene and say the part of wreckage will remain there until a final home is chosen			1
in the past , the @entity91 has taken some parts , while others have become part of museums			1
@entity96 , president of @entity97 , which owns 51 @entity25 , said , " we are cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities to make sure this piece of evidence is removed with care as quickly and effectively as possible			0
" this is not the first time this building has had national attention			0
it was the center of many protests while @entity109 , the @entity28 center , was seeking permission to locate there in 2010			0
critics said the center 's proximity to ground zero was unacceptable , while supporters argued it was meant to bring people together			0
waiting for a match in recent years , debris and human remains have been discovered in various spots around @entity122			1
in the past few weeks , the @entity123 has been sifting through 590 cubic yards of construction debris from around the @entity16 collected as recently as 2011			1
close to 100 pieces of potential human remains have been found since the new sifting operation began			1
the medical examiner will now try to identify these remains using dna			1
about 60 % of the more than 2,700 victims have had remains identified			2
some victim 's family members are hopeful that this new pile of construction debris will contain the match they still wait for			0
" it 'll be difficult			0
all the emotions , all the thoughts come rushing back to you			0
it would be a relief to know that these sacred remains are no longer sitting in a landfill somewhere , " said @entity142 who lost his brother , @entity145 captain @entity144 yet not all family members are anxiously waiting for the phone to ring			2
" i really did n't want to find anything out , anything after a certain point in time because it would only be rehashing things all over again , " said @entity152 , who lost her son @entity153 , an employee of the firm @entity154			0
" he 's in a good place i 'm sure and some day i 'll see him , and i just feel like this is not something that i want to deal with right now			0
i do n't feel that it will do anything for me if they find a bone fragment			0
" the total number of victims whose remains have been identified stands at 1,635 , according to the @entity171 's office			2
@entity1 's @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			0

@entity10 confirms that the part is from a 767 like the ones that hit the @entity16
