@entity0 -- so there 's this guy , @entity3 , who seems pretty liberal			2
used to smoke pot and does n't think it 's as dangerous as alcohol			2
says he would n't let a son play pro football			0
some call him one of those @entity12 who believe they can save the world			0
maybe he used to be , but the last year has been pretty tough and he 's sounding a bit more grounded these days when you actually sit down and talk to him			2
@entity3 could be any number of @entity18 -- an educated , white - collar guy having his idealistic vision blunted by midlife realities such as raising two daughters			2
in this case , he 's the @entity24 on the fifth anniversary of his inauguration as the nation 's first african - american commander in chief			2
an expansive profile by @entity31 magazine shows @entity32 as both impatient with and accepting of the political , social and personal limitations on his ability to achieve the bold hopes and dreams described in his now famous 2004 @entity38 speech that elevated him to the national stage			1
" i believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity , " he said that night in @entity40			0
" i believe we can provide jobs for the jobless , homes to the homeless , and reclaim young people in cities across @entity18 from violence and despair			0
i believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs , and that as we stand on the crossroads of history , we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us			0
" a decade later , now - president @entity32 bears the political scars and graying hair of five years in the @entity62 , and @entity64 's profile reveals the burden he carries			1
@entity32 would not let his son play football " every morning and every night , i 'm taking measure of my actions against the options and possibilities available to me , understanding that there are going to be mistakes that i make and my team makes and that @entity18 makes ; understanding that there are going to be limits to the good we can do and the bad that we can prevent , and that there 's going to be tragedy out there and , by occupying this office , i am part of that tragedy occasionally , " @entity32 says in the profile			1
he continues the thought by adding " that if i am doing my very best and basing my decisions on the core values and ideals that i was brought up with and that i think are pretty consistent with those of most @entity18 , that at the end of the day things will be better rather than worse			1
" the profile , which included one - on - one interviews , made news on some issues			1
@entity32 revealed a middle - ground stance on pot , saying he warns his daughters against smoking it as he did , but also complaining that too many young people face lengthy prison terms for something he says is less dangerous to the user than alcohol			2
he has no son , but if he did , he would stop the boy from becoming a pro football player because of the chronic debilitating injuries , says the @entity111 fan			0
on political and policy issues , @entity32 acknowledges he completed his evolution from noncommittal to fully supportive of gay marriage before making his stance public in 2012 , a few months before his re-election for a second term			1
it was " fair to say that i may have come to that realization slightly before i actually made the announcement , " @entity32 admits in the profile			1
" but this was not a situation where i kind of did a wink and a nod and a 180 - degree turn			0
" regarding the trifecta of international negotiations involving thorny @entity130 issues -- @entity131 , @entity133 's nuclear ambitions and the @entity136 - @entity135 conflict -- @entity32 concedes the chances for completing final treaties in any of them are less than 50 %			1
@entity32 says marijuana ' no more dangerous than alcohol ' " in all three circumstances we may be able to push the boulder partway up the hill and maybe stabilize it so it does n't roll back on us , " he says in the profile			1
" and all three are connected			0
i do believe that the region is going through rapid change and inexorable change			0
some of it is demographics ; some of it is technology ; some of it is economics			0
and the old order , the old equilibrium , is no longer tenable			0
the question then becomes , ' what 's next ? ' " the theme of historical context and taking the long view runs through many of @entity32 's remarks in the profile			1
while he spent the 2012 election campaign touting his accomplishments -- recovery from the recession , health care reform , ending the @entity176 war and winding down combat operations in @entity178 -- @entity32 sounds more reflective now after a first year in his second term mired in political stalemate with recalcitrant @entity181 over immigration reform , gun control and the endless battles over spending and taxes			1
referring to the famous line from the film version of @entity190 's " @entity189 , " @entity32 says that " it turns out @entity192 had it easy , because , when it comes to @entity196 , there is no such thing as an offer they ca n't refuse			1
" while he ascribes some of the relentless political opposition he faces to race , he also points out that he gets some benefit as the first @entity204 - @entity18 president			0
" there 's no doubt that there 's some folks who just really dislike me because they do n't like the idea of a black president , " @entity32 says			1
" now , the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because i 'm a black president			0
" he evokes the name and legacy of @entity220 in providing his own long view of both the role of a president and his own efforts in the @entity225			0
" despite being the greatest president , in my mind , in our history , " he says of @entity226 , " it took another 150 years before african - americans had anything approaching formal equality , much less real equality			2
" to @entity32 , " that does n't diminish @entity220 's achievements , but it acknowledges that at the end of the day we 're part of a long - running story , " he says , adding : " we just try to get our paragraph right			1

in a major magazine profile , president @entity32 *emphasizes* historical context
ten years after *bursting* onto the national scene , @entity32 's vision sounds less lofty
still pushing for equal opportunity , he says in the end things will be better than worse
@entity32 : chances for final treaties in talks on three @entity130 issues less than 50 %
