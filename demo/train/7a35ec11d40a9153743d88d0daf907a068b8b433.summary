-- the @entity1 for now is staying out of the hot - button issue of concealed weapons laws			1
the justices on monday declined to review two cases brought by the @entity6 that deal with whether those age 18 - 20 can buy and then carry handguns in public for self - defense			1
the justices gave no reason for denying those cases and a third gun - control appeal on out - of - state weapon transfers			1
the decision not to intervene means the state and federal laws at issue will remain in effect , and are at least a temporary setback for gun - rights advocates			1
the @entity6 had hoped the court was prepared to address a broader , politically explosive issue -- whether there was a fundamental constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon in public			1
the @entity1 in 2008 said the @entity28 guarantees an individual right to have a handgun in the home to protect life and property			1
both current handgun cases originated in @entity35 , which included a challenge to state restrictions over " concealed carry " permits			2
at issue in @entity6 v. @entity41 ( 13 - 390 ) was whether the right to bear arms in public for self - defense extends to responsible , law - abiding 18 - to 20 - year - olds			1
state law permits those 21 and older to apply for a license to carry a concealed weapon			0
many states have similar restrictions , citing concerns over crime rates among certain young adults , and whether they have the necessary level of maturity and responsibility to carry a handgun			0
the second legal challenge dealt with a 1968 congressional law that restricts sales of handguns by federally - licensed firearms dealers only to those 21 and older			2
those 18 - to - 20 may still be allowed to purchase shotguns and certain type of rifles , or receive handguns as a gift			2
two young @entity35 gun owners -- @entity70 and @entity71 -- had brought the original lawsuit in @entity6 v. @entity73 ( 13 - 137 )			1
again , the nation 's most powerful gun rights group failed to convince the high court to address whether a nationwide , class - based , categorical ban on meaningful access to exercise the right to keep and bear arms for self - defense violated the @entity28			1
the justices also turned down a more narrow appeal in @entity84 ( 12 - 1401 ) , denying gun owners in @entity86 the ability to sue over city laws making it hard to legally transfer weapons purchased in nearby jurisdictions			2
since the nation 's capital does not have any federally - licensed gun shops , residents seeking a handgun typically have to go to nearby @entity97 or @entity98			2
once the high court established an " individual " right to keep a handgun in the home , it has been reluctant to broaden that right in a variety of subsequent challenges to other firearm restrictions			0
the @entity108 estimates as many as 275 million guns are in the @entity110			0
in 2005 , the last time figures were available , three - quarters of the 10,100 homicides by firearms nationwide were committed with handguns			0
@entity116 , a @entity86 lawyer challenging the federal restrictions on handgun sales to those under 21 , expressed frustration at that reluctance			0
" given the number of laws enacted by the federal government , states , and localities in the years when a mistaken understanding of the @entity28 held sway , one would have expected a major reconsideration of extant firearms laws to have occurred , " said @entity116 in a brief filed with the court			0
" instead , jurisdictions have engaged in massive resistance to the clear import of those landmark decisions , and the lower federal courts , long out of the habit of taking the @entity28 seriously , have largely facilitated the resistance , " he said			0
efforts to craft compromise gun - control legislation have stalled in @entity141 despite the @entity144 , @entity143 , school massacre in 2012 and a string of mass shootings since			1
the high court six years ago -- for the first time -- affirmed an individual 's right to own a firearm , when it struck down @entity86 's handgun restrictions			0
but the court confined its analysis just to the home , leaving in place other gun control laws , including those " forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools			2
" while the court for now is staying out of the concealed carry issue , it may be forced back into the debate			0
federal appeals courts in @entity167 and @entity168 have issued opposite rulings in recent weeks .			0

@entity1 declined to review two cases brought by @entity6
the decision is seens as a temporary setback for gun rights advocates
gun - control efforts have stalled in @entity141 despite @entity144 and a string of other mass shootings
