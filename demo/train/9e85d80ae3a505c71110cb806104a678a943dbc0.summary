-- they are the famous voices			2
the actors whose names and faces you may not know -- but they 're aiming to change that			2
every july , at @entity9 , voice actors enjoy major celebrity status along with a-list stars who do on - camera acting			1
it 's a welcome change for the never - seen actors who may usually go unnoticed			1
following @entity0 's 2012 interviews with several voice actors , @entity18 ( best known as @entity19 on " @entity20 " and @entity21 on " @entity22 " ) had been finishing work on a documentary that sought to pay tribute to those unsung famous voices behind animated icons			1
" @entity37 , " is set to make a splash with a comic - con panel thursday , and features interviews with multiple generations of voice - over artists including @entity33 ( @entity34 ) and 95 - year - old @entity35 ( @entity36 )			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity18 , and the film 's director @entity39 , as well as veteran voice actress @entity41 from the new animated series " @entity43 @entity38 " strong is also known for her work on " rugrats , " " @entity47 , " and " @entity48 : friendship is @entity50			1
" ( " @entity22 , " " @entity47 " and " @entity43 go ! " all air on @entity52 which , like @entity0 , is a subsidiary of @entity53 )			0
comic con 2013 : what we ca n't wait to see @entity0 : where did the idea for this documentary originate ? @entity18 : @entity59 [ @entity39 ] and i were in @entity61 for a thing we 've been doing for a long time called " jam in the ' @entity66			1
" we 'd just been talking about stuff we wanted to do and @entity59 said we should do something about voiceover			0
" @entity37 " came from that			1
@entity39 : you 'd see people enjoy @entity18 on one level as an emcee , then he would bust out a voice like @entity19 and you 'd see everyone 's jaw drop			1
@entity18 : i got a bunch of people i work with on a regular basis to come talk to us			1
i owe a lot of people a lot of favors now , so i 'm screwed			0
i kind of wanted to make a valentine to the folks i work with , and give a little face - time to these folks who entertain so many people all of the time and do n't really get credit			2
it is a close - knit group of people , and it 's a group of actors that really look out for each other			1
it 's a competitive industry and these people are the least competitive and some of the most talented			2
it 's just a really good group of people and that 's what we wanted to show in the film			2
strong : we all know each other and we see each other wherever we go			0
it 's usually the same 10 or 20 people on every show at a time			0
the nice thing about the voice acting community is there 's this camaraderie , we know there 's work for everyone			1
you do n't get the same sort of cattiness that you 'd get on camera			0
it 's not about what you look like			0
i 'm pretty amazed by voice actors every day			1
@entity0 : how often do you get recognized ? @entity18 : people are starting to recognize me at these conventions , but as soon as i walk away from the convention , people do n't really know who i am , which is great because i love flying under the radar			1
strong : anytime around the conventions , we 're suddenly superstars			0
@entity18 : you get these more mainstream projects and suddenly you 're walking down the street and someone says , " hey man you do that voice ! " that 's a strange thing			1
i did n't get into this business to be famous ; i got into this to work			0
@entity0 : do you ever breathe a sigh of relief when you see on - camera celebrities getting mobbed ? @entity18 : yeah , do i really want to have to invest in hand sanitizer ? i 'm good			1
@entity0 : how easily can you call upon all of your various characters ? strong : once i create a character , they live up there in my head			0
some people say , " i want to get into voice acting because i have an interesting voice , " but there 's so much more to it than that , bringing characters to life through your acting abilities			1
i do n't even know where they come from half the time , they 're in there -- whenever it 's time to play , they come out and they do n't get mixed up			0
@entity0 : what do you think of the rise of " name " actors getting involved in animated features after the success of " @entity175 , " " @entity177 " and " @entity178 ? " @entity18 : that 's a difficult call , from a producer 's standpoint you want to bring in names just to create a buzz			1
sure , but in the long run , kids do n't really care who 's doing the voice as long as it 's good			2
it 's a constant dilemma that we in the trenches have to deal with all the time			0
they 're starting to cast names a lot more in cartoons , because a lot of people are becoming hip to the job			0
" really , i do n't have to go to the makeup trailer and wait 10 hours to shoot one scene ? " it 's an interesting thing that names are coming out of the woodwork			0
but if you 're a producer , if you want to make money , you got ta spend money , i suppose , in that vein			0
there 's enough to go around i think			0
strong : i 've been doing it for over 25 years and others doing it even longer			0
sometimes they 'll give millions of dollars to an on - camera celebrity who is n't as convincing as one of the voiceover greats			0
it 's nice to see ( voiceover actors ) get more recognition , that 's for sure			2
