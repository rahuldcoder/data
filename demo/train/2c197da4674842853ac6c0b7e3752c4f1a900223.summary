-- the wait is finally over			0
on saturday night , " @entity10 " ( " @entity12 " fans ) finally got their first full look at @entity4 in his role as the @entity6 ( with no karaoke or mimes in sight )			1
he almost literally landed with a splash , as we first saw him and companion @entity15 being swallowed by a dinosaur who ended up in 19th century @entity18			2
here are five of our favorite moments of what was a spectacular season premiere			0
the new doctor himself the doctor was still in a bit of post-regenerative hysteria , which led to some hilarious lines			0
he also , of course , took a few shots at his new look , especially the eyebrows ( " these are attack eyebrows ! you can take bottle tops off with these ! " ) and the fact that he 's now @entity33			0
that was probably one of the biggest surprises : for a doctor who is darker than the ones we 're used to recently ( he certainly does n't have the wackiness of @entity45 ) , there was a great deal of humor in the episode			1
when we saw his final costume toward the end of the episode , we 've got ta say , the twelfth doctor is looking sharp			2
@entity15 back how we remember her when @entity15 first officially met the doctor , she was in @entity58 dress			1
having ended up in the 19th century , she was dressed for the times once more			0
whether it was a callback or not , the producers seemed to know that the look really suits @entity63 ( in fact , a lot of the memorable parts of this episode seemed to do with the clothes - see @entity70 and @entity71 's battle gear as well )			1
with a few episodes under her belt , @entity15 is the " veteran " of the show , and much of it revolved around her , especially with the doctor being in a confused state for much of it			1
she had some trouble getting used to this new doctor , having fallen for the last one ( see below ) , but she had instant chemistry with the @entity6			0
the icky new villain a restaurant where you 're on the menu ? the half - visaged android the doctor met could give @entity88 a run for his money			2
their face - off ( sorry ) toward the end was one of the most memorable confrontations in recent " @entity12 " history as well			2
a dinosaur in the @entity98 ? ! not much to say here , except that tyrannosaurus rex was quite a way to kick off the season			0
the eleventh doctor makes a call the biggest surprise of them all was the @entity103 's time - shifted call to @entity15 at the end of the episode , asking her to take care of the new him			1
( though he was n't a big fan of looking old			0
) we 'll miss you , @entity45 ! what were your favorite parts of the episode ?			1
