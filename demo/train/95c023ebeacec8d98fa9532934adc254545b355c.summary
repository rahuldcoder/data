-- in this space , @entity1 , former undersecretary of defense under president @entity4 , and some of her colleagues attacked a recent @entity8 opinion piece in the @entity9			1
in their piece , entitled " @entity8 's empty foreign policy agenda , " they hurl all sorts of tired accusations at the @entity16 nominee			1
they even recycle a trope used by @entity19 against @entity20 and other successful @entity16 presidents , that @entity8 employs " cowboy rhetoric			0
" yet even as they condemn the @entity16 nominee for wrapping himself in " platitudes and falsehoods , " they offer a remarkable demonstration of some of the serious problems afflicting @entity4 's stewardship of @entity32 's role in the world			1
let us scrutinize some of their points			0
opinion : @entity8 's empty foreign policy agenda on @entity39 , they assert that there are " zero actual policy differences " between @entity4 and @entity8 , citing the president 's policy of sanctions			1
but what they neglect to say is that @entity4 resisted imposing the kind of new , crippling sanctions that are necessary to stop @entity39 nuclear efforts for much of his presidency			1
today , @entity39 is closer to a nuclear weapon than ever before			0
what they also conveniently forget is that @entity4 , saying he did not want to " be seen as meddling , " at first issued no more than cursory objections during the @entity39 spring of 2009 , when dissidents took to the streets of @entity60 and other cities to protest a stolen election			2
a president @entity8 would never abandon our basic principles of supporting freedom and democracy in this way			0
@entity1 and company point proudly to the fact that @entity70 is dead " on the president 's watch			1
" they are right to be proud of this , as are all @entity32			0
but when they say that " more @entity76 senior leaders have been taken off the battlefield than at any time since 9/11 , " they run the danger of hubris			2
and hubris has been one of the defining characteristics of the president 's foreign policy			1
alas , we saw a tragic demonstration of the consequences of hubris just this past september 11 , when four @entity32 -- including our ambassador -- were murdered in a terrorist attack on our consulate in @entity92 , @entity93			2
perhaps believing its own rhetoric about the decimation of @entity76 , the @entity4 administration let down its guard about the significant striking power of @entity76 's remnants , affiliated and otherwise			1
certainly , the inadequate protection given to our diplomatic personnel on september 11 -- the anniversary of the terrible attack -- is a spectacular piece of evidence that their judgment was skewed			0
even worse , after the attack on @entity92 , the @entity4 administration appeared to be so desperate to believe that @entity76 was not responsible that it pinned the entire episode on the spontaneous rage of a crowd provoked by an obscure video on the @entity113			2
it clung to this version past the point of decency			0
@entity32 intelligence agencies have made it clear that our citizens were killed in a terrorist attack launched by an @entity76 affiliate			0
@entity1 's assertion that @entity4 " has effectively managed the tumult of the @entity126 " would be laughable if the consequences of his lack of effective management were not so tragic			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity132 .			0

@entity132 : despite *criticism* of @entity8 on foreign policy , @entity4 's record *flawed*
he says @entity4 took too long to push crippling sanctions for @entity39 ; @entity8 would have *sooner*
*writers* cited @entity70 's death on @entity4 's watch , but that 's hubris , @entity132 says
he says administration let guard down on @entity76 ; @entity93 killings are tragic consequence
