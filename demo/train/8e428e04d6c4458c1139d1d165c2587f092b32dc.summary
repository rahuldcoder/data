-- a @entity2 betting firm has sparked outrage with a controversial advert which offers punters money back if @entity7 sports star @entity6 is found not guilty of the murder of his girlfriend @entity9			1
bookmaker @entity10 began its book on the outcome of the trial last week , prompting widespread criticism on social media , but then updated its offer with the advert to coincide with monday 's start of the trial in @entity20			1

money back if he walks			1
we will refund all losing bets on @entity6 if he is found not guilty			2
" in response , an online petition has been started on @entity32 , demanding that @entity10 withdraws its " offensive betting " on the outcome of the trial and donates any profits to a women 's charity fighting domestic violence			1
it quickly gathered over 60,000 signatures and counting within a few hours of being promoted			0
the petition was started by @entity41 , who said on the campaign page she was herself a " survivor of domestic violence and abuse			0
" her statement added : " i know how many women around the world are suffering right now thinking that they are lucky to be alive when poor @entity9 is dead			0
" @entity10 are putting all survivors and the families of those who died through even more pain and anguish and they must stop			2
" @entity52 , director of @entity53 , told the @entity2 's @entity54 of her disgust at the ad campaign			2
