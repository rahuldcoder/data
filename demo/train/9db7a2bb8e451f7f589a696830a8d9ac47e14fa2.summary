he became a top commander in the early 1990s , when he was appointed as one of the @entity12 's seven - member general secretariat			2
he eventually became the @entity12 's military commander in chief			2
although he was considered the no. 2 person in the rebel group , @entity10 had much more military experience and time served in the @entity12 than its leader , @entity137 , who was appointed to the general secretariat as the result of a deal with the @entity7 communist party			1

@entity10 also was the first @entity12 commander to order in the late 1980s or early 1990s that the rebels collect a tax from peasant farmers on coca plant cultivation			1
