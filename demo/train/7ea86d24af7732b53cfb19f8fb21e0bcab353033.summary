-- peace envoy @entity1 expressed dismay tuesday at the lack of progress in ending the civil war in @entity6 and called on the @entity7 to act			1
" @entity6 is being destroyed bit by bit and , in destroying @entity6 , the region is being pushed into a situation that is extremely bad and extremely important for the entire world , " the @entity7 and @entity9 joint special envoy told reporters after meeting in private with the @entity7			1
" that is why i believe @entity7 simply can not continue to say , ' we are in disagreement ; therefore , let 's wait for better times			1
' i think they have got to grapple with this problem now			1
" @entity1 blamed the government of president @entity24 and opposition activists for the impasse			1
" objectively , they are cooperating in destroying @entity6 , " he said			1
the @entity7 has proven ineffectual in brokering a peace , with @entity29 and @entity30 casting vetoes to block resolutions on sanctions			1
@entity1 suggested a return to the @entity36 communique of last june as a possible way of making progress			1
the proposal was drawn up during a conference in the @entity42 city that brought together representatives from world powers that had been at odds over the conflict			0
the resulting proposal called for a cease - fire , a transitional government and a new constitution , though it did not specify whether @entity24 would have to step down			1
@entity30 and @entity29 joined @entity51 , @entity52 , the @entity53 and @entity54 in agreeing on the plan			1
@entity9 nations also signed on to it			0
but neither the opposition nor @entity24 's government has signaled a willingness to sign on to it			2
still , the declaration contains " a lot of elements that would provide for a reasonable solution to the conflict , " @entity1 said			2
" the council has got to reaffirm the attachment and support for @entity6 's independence , sovereignty , territorial integrity , also for the rights of every citizen in @entity6 to their human rights and dignity , irrelevant of gender , religion or any other element , " he added			2
the communique calls for the creation of a transitional government with full executive powers			2
" i think that there was a very clever , creative ambiguity in this declaration and i have told them that that ambiguity has to be lifted now , " he said			0
" you 've got to say what these full executive powers mean ... all the powers of state have got to go to that government			2
" asked about rumors that he planned to resign , @entity1 was resolute : " i am not a quitter , " he said			2
" the @entity95 has no choice but to remain engaged with this problem -- whether i am there or not			1
the moment i feel that i am totally useless , i will not stay one minute more			0
i did n't want this job			0
i did n't look for it			0
i do n't need it as a job			0
so if i 'm doing it , it 's because -- maybe stupidly -- i feel sense of duty			0
" @entity1 's predecessor , former secretary - general @entity108 , resigned from the same post last august			1
@entity53 ambassador to the @entity95 @entity111 said @entity1 gave the @entity7 " a frank and very grim assessment			1
" though " a lot " of council members expressed support for his efforts , there were " no answers , " @entity113 said			0
" there are no promises of any big breakthrough			0
" the envoy 's comments came on the same day that the executed bodies of scores of men were found tuesday in @entity6 , yet another grisly discovery that opposition activists blamed on the government			1
residents pulled 80 of them from the @entity133 in the town of @entity135 , near @entity137 city , opposition activists said			0
an opposition video -- the authenticity of which @entity0 could not verify -- showed a row of bodies splayed on a muddy river bank , their heads bearing wounds , their hands tied behind their backs			0
some of the bodies showed signs of torture			0
@entity151 , an opposition spokesman in the @entity137 countryside , said 20 of the victims had been identified by their relatives who said the men had been arrested and detained in @entity137 by @entity157 intelligence			0
the state - run @entity158 blamed the killings on @entity161 , an @entity162 opposition group			0
" the families have identified a number of the killed , stressing that @entity161 abducted them because of their rejection to cooperate with this terrorist group , " @entity158 reported , citing a media source			0
" the bodies , which terrorists and tv misleading channels have claimed that the army killed their owners , were found in the side where terrorists present , " @entity158 quoted one of its reporters as saying			0
it was the latest report of mass killings in the @entity6 civil war , a battle between @entity24 's government and insurgents			1
in all tuesday , 228 @entity6 were killed tuesday , according to the opposition @entity183			2
the @entity6 unrest started nearly two years ago when the government cracked down on civilians peacefully protesting government policies			1
the conflict morphed into a civil war			0
since then , it has claimed more than 60,000 lives , according to the @entity95			2
" the regime adds another massacre to its record while the entire @entity9 world and the international community keep watching the @entity6 misery in silence and complete hypocrisy , " the opposition @entity192 said			1
in the opposition video , men can be heard shouting , " this is unbelievable ! " and " some were children , children for @entity207 's sake ! " one man can be heard saying , " tell the world these were not soldiers			0
how come they know what the law of gravity is but they do n't know anything about human rights			0
" opposition groups have regularly reported massacres by government forces and their allies			0
some of the more notorious reports include incidents in @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , and @entity234			0
bombings in @entity137 and @entity236 have resulted in many deaths			0

" the current aid system is unable to address the worsening living conditions facing people inside @entity6 , " said dr. @entity252 , president of @entity239			1
" the participants in the @entity248 conference must acknowledge the legitimacy of cross-border humanitarian operations intended for @entity6 and grant them the financial , administrative and logistical support they require			2
