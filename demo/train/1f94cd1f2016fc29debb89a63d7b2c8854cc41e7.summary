-- a rare tropical disease called @entity3 worm is closer to being eradicated , according to former president @entity4 and other experts			1
there are now only 542 known cases of @entity3 worm left worldwide , as of 2012 , representing a 48 % decrease from 2011 , officials said thursday at a news conference			1
" we can not rest until we get and contain the very last case , " said dr. @entity11 , affiliated with the @entity12 in @entity13 , which has been instrumental in the effort to wipe out guinea worm			1
the @entity18 this week said in a report that @entity3 worm , also called dracunculiasis , has a global eradication target for the year 2015			1
so far , only one disease has reached the status of worldwide eradication since 1980 : smallpox			1
guinea worm a greater challenge than smallpox in 1986 , when the @entity12 began leading its international campaign against guinea worm disease , there were 3.5 million cases in 21 countries			1
@entity34 has the most known cases today , at 521 , followed by @entity36 ( 10 ) , @entity37 ( 7 ) , and @entity38 ( 4 ) , according to the @entity12			2
these are the only four countries that still have transmission of @entity3 worm			2
in @entity34 , a war is waged to eradicate the ' fiery serpent ' a main obstacle to eradication is that one case of guinea worm disease , if not addressed quickly , can spread to hundreds more people , @entity4 said			1
communities that depend chiefly on open water sources like ponds in rural and isolated areas are especially affected , according to the @entity18			1
the disease gets into the body when people drink contaminated water , which contains water fleas that have ingested @entity3 worm larvae			1
the human stomach kills the water fleas , but not the larvae within			0
worms can get through the intestinal wall and move around under skin tissues			0
a patient will develop a painful skin blister , through which a worm will emerge about 10 to 14 months after infection			2
the worm can be up to three feet long , and looks like a very long spaghetti noodle			2
when the patient heads to a body of water to try to soothe the fiery pain , the worm deposits more larvae in the water , and the cycle starts over			2
no vaccines or treatments are available for guinea worm , but the international effort has made significant strides with health education and encouraging behavior changes			1
how fight against @entity3 worm was won prevention strategies include filtering drinking water and discouraging people with @entity3 worm from wading in water			2
water can also be chemically treated with larvicide			0
while guinea worm disease does not usually result in death , it is associated with incapacitating pain and secondary bacterial infections			1
patients find it difficult to work , farm and function			0
in a household where a parent has had @entity3 worm , toddlers will be less well nourished because the infected parent will have difficulty farming , @entity11 said			2
@entity4 recalled thursday that he first saw people living with guinea worm in @entity111			1
he saw a young woman , about 20 , who appeared to be holding a baby			0
but he discovered that it was not a baby ; it was her right breast , which was swollen because of the disease			2
the international effort is monitoring about 7,000 villages , @entity4 said			0
" we need to find anyone who has guinea worm " and " prevent them from going back to the water source , " he said			1
in terms of government support from individual countries , @entity34 is most strongly behind the eradication efforts , @entity11 said			0
in that country , there are about 110 workers on payroll , and some 12,000 unpaid volunteers , @entity4 said			0
the program in @entity37 , however , has not been able to operate fully , or at all , in areas occupied by rebel groups , said @entity137 , director of the @entity138 at the @entity12			0
the unrest there has made efforts to stop @entity3 worm more difficult			0
educating people about guinea worm has other benefits besides preventing this specific disease , @entity11 said , such as helping people to think more carefully about the water they drink			1
a clean water supply can help prevent other diseases			0
such education efforts also empower local populations , showing them that they can do something to correct their own problems , @entity4 said			0
villagers often want to know how to address other diseases , too			0
" the people themselves say , ' how can you help us with other problems ? ' " @entity4 said			0
@entity0 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
