the latest chapter in @entity2 's long legal battle began monday in @entity3 , @entity4 , with a retrial over the 2007 killing of her @entity8 roommate @entity10			1
but @entity11 , 26 , who has expressed concern about returning to a country where she spent four years behind bars , was not in court			1
neither was @entity18 's family , which said in a statement submitted by their lawyer in court on monday that they would be following the new trial closely from the @entity8			1
@entity11 was convicted in 2009 of murdering @entity18 , a 21 - year old @entity8 exchange student who was found stabbed to death in november 2007 in the villa the two young women rented in the central @entity4 university town of @entity29			1
family : @entity2 wo n't return to @entity4 for new trial the convictions of @entity11 and her ex-boyfriend , @entity33 , were overturned in 2011 for " lack of evidence			1
" after her acquittal , @entity11 returned to her hometown of @entity39 , where she has been living since			2
@entity11 : sometimes , i ca n't stop crying but @entity4 's @entity41 decided last year to retry the case , saying the jury that acquitted @entity11 did n't consider all the evidence , and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered			1
the retrial 's opening day monday was dominated by procedural items			0
the presiding judge , @entity50 , read out the facts of the case , including the conviction of @entity55 native @entity10 for his role in @entity18 's murder			1
the defense teams asked for several items of evidence to be retested for dna , and @entity50 agreed that a knife found in @entity33 's apartment would be re-examined			0
the court also agreed to hear testimony from @entity66 , who served time in jail with @entity33 and claims that his brother killed @entity18			2
also absent from the proceedings monday was @entity70 , the @entity29 prosecutor who won the original conviction and then lost the appeal			0
however , @entity10 , the @entity74 bartender @entity11 originally accused of @entity18 's murder was in court			1
@entity76 spent several weeks in jail after @entity11 accused him , and he won a defamation suit against her , for which she was ordered to pay â‚¬ 22,000 ( $ 29,800 ) for his court costs			1

afraid to go back @entity11 has said she 's scared to return to @entity4			1
" i 'm afraid to go back there , " she said in an interview with @entity89 's @entity88 in may			1
" i do n't want to go back into prison			0
" the high court also said evidence could support prosecutors ' initial argument -- that @entity18 was killed in a twisted sex game gone wrong			0
@entity11 has said such claims are " a bombardment of falsehood and fantasy			2
" @entity4 court on reason for retrial : evidence neglected " no one has ever claimed that i was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity			1
none of my roommates , none of my friends , none of the people who knew me there			0
this is simply coming out of the prosecution , " she told @entity89 in may			0
" i was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip			0
i have never done that			0
i have never taken part in an orgy			0
" the @entity41 's decision to send the case back to the appeal court for retrial " may be interpreted by the @entity126 authorities as double jeopardy -- twice tried for the same fact or the same case , " said @entity122 , a law lecturer at @entity123 in @entity124			1
" in @entity4 it 's not like this , because this is still the same trial			1
" @entity33 , @entity11 's former boyfriend , said he plans to stay in the @entity137 with a friend			1
he said he has no immediate plans to return to @entity4			2
watching from afar if the court convicts her , @entity11 will be ordered to return to @entity4			1
if she refuses , @entity4 could request her extradition from the @entity126			1
but it 's not clear if @entity126 authorities would comply			2
opinion : we 're obsessed when it 's white women in trouble @entity11 has said she would be willing to take a lie detector test			2
" i 'd do anything to prove my innocence , " she told @entity89 affiliate @entity153 earlier this month			0
" i do n't think that is necessary			0
but like i said , i 'm doing everything to prove my innocence			0
it 's just very sad that 's what it has come to			0
" @entity11 is n't the only person watching the retrial from afar			2
citing health reasons , @entity18 's family said in a statement that they decided not to return to @entity4 for the beginning of the trial after speaking " at great length			1
" " it is an extremely stressful time for us all and we desperately want to find truth and justice for @entity10 , who was so brutally and unnecessarily taken from us , and so we have decided to support each other in the @entity8 and follow closely here , " the statement said			2
the family said they would remain in close contact with their lawyer , who was in the courtroom monday			0
" we trust that the evidence will be reviewed and any additional testing requested to be granted so that any unanswered questions can be clarified and the court can clearly decide the next steps in this tragic case , " the statement said			0
