-- social - networking giant @entity1 has entered the check - in world			1
@entity1 executives on wednesday announced the launch of @entity5 , which -- similar to services such as @entity7 and @entity8 -- will allow people to use the gps on their mobile phones to let friends know exactly where they are			1
@entity5 is available immediately in the @entity15 through the latest version of @entity1 's @entity18 app and , for other advanced mobile phones , through the company 's site for advanced mobile devices , executives announced at @entity1 's headquarters in @entity24 , @entity25			1
users who wish to announce their location to their friends on @entity1 would tap a " check in " button to see a list of places nearby , and then choose the place that matches where they are			1
" after checking in , your check - in will create a story in your friends ' @entity39 [ on @entity1 ] and show up in the recent activity section on the page for that place , " places product manager @entity34 wrote on @entity1 's blog			2
what do you think of the new feature ? @entity1 staff also said the feature will be useful not only to let friends know where they are , but also to learn if their friends are nearby at the same time , and to write down what they are doing at the location and what they think about it -- creating a trail allowing friends to see what the writer did there days or even years ago			1
when users check into a place , they also can " tag " any @entity1 friends who are with them , essentially letting other friends know that the person is there , too			0
to cut down on the potential for users to falsely tag friends to a place , people can tag friends only if the taggers themselves check in to the location , too			0
@entity75 , speaking during wednesday 's announcement , said @entity5 has other safeguards to address potential privacy concerns			0
first , check - ins will appear only to users ' @entity1 friends as a default , and users can further trim the recipients list to specific friends			2
users also can remove check - ins by phone or web at any time , @entity75 said			0
@entity1 said it would make places available in other countries and on more mobile platforms soon			2
@entity1 staff said the company planned to let @entity7 , @entity8 and other services enhance their current integration with @entity1			1
executives with @entity7 and @entity8 were at wednesday 's announcement in @entity24 , previewing plans to ramp up how their users will announce their locations on the social - networking site			1
the past year has seen big growth in the relatively new mobile check - in space			0
@entity7 , which essentially made its debut in 2009 at the @entity106 festival in @entity107 , @entity108 , was one of the combatants in a so - called " @entity111 " at this year 's festival , going heads - up with @entity107 - based rival @entity8			1
since then , @entity7 has become the clear favorite of the two -- and a darling of tech media , even as it looks for ways to turn a profit			0
boasting a half - million users at the start of @entity106 , @entity7 doubled that in about a month then needed only another three months to hit 2 million last month			2
on mobile apps like @entity7 , users " check in " at restaurants , bars , movie theaters or just about anywhere else they visit			0
the idea is twofold -- to let friends know what you 're up to , while racking up points and earning virtual badges in the application 's gaming element			0
the @entity138 - based foursquare has begun forging some corporate partnerships and some businesses have started offering discounts and other deals for users who check in frequently			1
@entity1 , with its half - billion users , represents a massive potential user base for @entity5			0
@entity0 's @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0
