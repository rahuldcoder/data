-- on saturday , @entity2 " @entity5 " @entity1 , the kingpin of the @entity4 drug cartel , was captured in a joint effort by @entity8 authorities and the @entity9			1
the latest in a series of major cartel arrests under @entity8 president @entity13 , @entity5 's capture is the culmination of a dozen - year transcontinental manhunt to bring down the man who internationalized @entity8 's drug trade			1
@entity5 's significance to transnational organized crime can hardly be overstated			0
from the @entity21 to @entity22 , @entity23 to @entity24 , he was , in a perverse sense , an innovator : the first to develop a truly global narcotics and criminal network that would eventually net him upward of $ 3 billion each year , according to a 2013 @entity31 documentary entitled " @entity5 : @entity32			2
" and the legend of the kingpin is even greater			0
many , including that documentary , credit him with building the first tunnels to subvert the @entity39 - @entity8 border , with bribing countless officials right here in the @entity39 and with escalating the bloodletting in the fight with @entity4 's rival cartel , the @entity44			1
last year , the city of @entity46 labeled @entity5 " @entity51 " -- a moniker that was last used for @entity53 in the 1930s -- despite the kingpin 's never having set foot in the city , according to @entity50			2
he has been called the @entity55 of drug trafficking -- but more elusive			1
given his role in drug trafficking -- not to mention his still more inflated stature in the collective imagination -- it is hard to overstate the symbolic significance of his capture			1
the sheer scope of his operations , his true corporatization and internationalization of drug trafficking , and the 13 - year manhunt that preceded his capture this weekend render immeasurable the symbolic weight of his apprehension			2
and coming months might see him extradited to the @entity39 , where many feel his trial and eventual imprisonment will be insulated from his power and corruption , which have so effectively protected him in @entity8			2
the arrest of the most wanted drug lord in the world will provide valuable insight into the vast networks he established but will probably not diminish demand for the products he was so expert at transporting			0
drug trafficking will continue , as will the violence and insecurity that go along with it			1
in the immediate future , @entity5 's arrest might generate some instability			0
but few believe that his arrest will mean the end of his business			0
the scope of his power suggests that in his absence , other brokers -- whether from inside his own @entity97 , through a member of his cohort @entity100 or from rival cartels such as the @entity44 or the @entity102 -- might seek to fill his shoes			0
and this scramble could be accompanied by something of a refocusing , as well			0
with @entity5 , the true honcho of international trafficking , behind bars , we might , at least in the short run , see an uptick in cartel activity within the @entity115 until the next kingpin with transcontinental aspirations emerges			1
similarly , his arrest might encourage cartels throughout @entity8 , pending their adjustment to his capture , to increase their non-narcotic activities : namely kidnapping , ransom and extortion			0
a key symbolic victory , @entity5 's arrest speaks to the success of @entity39 - @entity8 bilateral efforts in the war against transnational crime			1
but to view this weekend 's events as any more than one battle in the larger war would be overly optimistic			0
drug cartels will continue their violent operations with or without @entity5 , so his arrest can not be seen as an endpoint but rather a rallying point for continued efforts to dismantle what he and his contemporaries have built			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			0
