@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the outskirts of @entity0 , @entity1 , in the dusty crowded neighborhood of @entity6 , i 've just been treated to a traditional @entity1 coffee ceremony			1
the beans are roasted and the coffee boiled in front of you then served piping hot with a heaping spoonful of sugar and a side of freshly popped corn			2
as i step out onto the dirt road to leave , one of my hosts wants to ask a question : do i know anyone who can donate some wheelchairs , so adults do n't ' have to carry disabled children on their backs to school anymore ? i wish i did			1
the woman who needs the wheelchairs is one of the 20,000 volunteers for @entity29 , a @entity31 - funded program trying to help half a million highly vulnerable children			1
the name means " @entity36 from the @entity37 " in @entity38 , and is meant to reflect the resiliency of children			1
after spending a week working with the volunteers here , i have no doubt those wheelchairs are going to find their way , due to the resiliency of the adults			1

then they go out into communities , to find and identify the most vulnerable children			1
each volunteer will take in 25 of those kids as her own			1
" i have 29 children " says @entity59 , a mother of four ( plus 25 ) , " i ca n't separate them from my own			1
" the program 's philosophy is that the way to help children is to help their families			1
more often than not , assistance is needed in multiple areas -- and that means these volunteers have had to become master networkers -- calling on friends , family , neighbors , local businessmen and faith leaders to get the kids what they need			1
@entity82 , from the @entity81 neighborhood , tells me about a family of eight in which the father was sick and the mother was the breadwinner until she had a heart attack and died			2
@entity82 volunteered to foster the six kids			1
one of the boys was malnourished and @entity82 went to every health center in the area , telling doctors about him , until she found one to admit and treat him			0
she visited the local bakery and convinced the owner to provide breakfasts for another child			0
and she linked up the eldest with a government association that gave a scholarship to study hairdressing			0
volunteers receive a stipend of about $ 10 a month to cover phone and transportation costs			1
they are expected to give about 15 - 20 hours a week , but i found they all are giving much , much more			1
@entity113 has 31 kids , four of her own , two foster kids plus her 25 kids from the program			1
she 's given a small room in her compound , rent free , to a family of five			0
everyone except the youngest toddler is hiv positive			2
@entity126 is working to keep the kids in school and making sure the family keeps to their anti-viral medical regime			2
" we do n't want them to be dependent , " she says , " i 'm telling them to be self - reliant and we are all working towards that together			0
" @entity29 is also working in conjunction with local government and 40 civil society organizations to recruit , train and supervise the volunteers all over the country			2
in @entity1 , formal education does n't begin until age seven			1
so , the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) struck a deal with the local government			0
@entity142 would renovate and supply an early childhood development center if the government would pay the teachers			0
that partnership resulted in new brightly colored classroom expanded to serve 128 children , many of them considered highly vulnerable			1
@entity38 and @entity152 are taught , and on the day i visited , i was treated to a version of the nursery rhyme @entity154			0
but the backbone of the @entity158 program is the individual volunteers			2
a majority of the women i met were single mothers with big families of their own			0
some work as bread makers and vegetable sellers , but about half of those i spoke with seemed to have no other support			0
but yet everyone i met said it was their moral obligation to help others			0
" even after they turn 18 years we will still help them , by linking them up with the woreda ( local government ) and getting them skill training and jobs			0
we will empower our graduated children , " says @entity185 , who has two children of her own , plus her 25 fosters			1

through @entity29 's " @entity197 " each is getting help with a new venture and for the first time in their lives , saving money			2
the women enthusiastically describe their plans : one is switching from selling bananas to housewares , because the latter does n't spoil ; another is expanding her business from selling used clothes to new			0
but the profits will not be all theirs			0
as part of the program , two birr a week , about 10 cents , has got to go into a kitty to help out those in need			0
before i leave , one woman says there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood unable to go to school because of poor eyesight			2
she wants to know if i know anyone who can get them the glasses they need			0
but i 'm going to look into it			0
find out more about @entity29 .			0
