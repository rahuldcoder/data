@entity0 -- the @entity2 reported friday that office rents in @entity0 are poised to overtake rents in @entity5			1
@entity0 now boasts the lowest office vacancy rate in the nation			1
@entity5 is bleeding jobs , unemployment is over 10 percent			1
@entity0 is booming as government agencies like @entity11 and the @entity12 expand			1
@entity5 's crisis and @entity0 's growth is more than a business page story			1
over two centuries , @entity18 culture has been shaped by the physical separation of politics and finance			1
the @entity23 might centralize everything in @entity25 , the @entity26 in @entity27 , the other countries of @entity29 in their great capitals , but the @entity18 divided these functions			1
the constitution of the new republic provided for an autonomous federal district			0
it did not specify where that district should be			0
@entity37 and @entity38 both have federal districts that coincide with their greatest cities , and that option was at least theoretically available to the @entity18 as well			1
instead , the capital was sited on the swampy banks of the @entity45 , far from the great commercial centers of the founding era : @entity48 , @entity5 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
this decision had profound effects for the first 150 years of the new country 's life			2
if a business leader wanted to talk to a member of @entity58 or the @entity59 , he had to take a long train ride , often a very long train ride			1
simpler and easier to leave the job to a lobbyist			0
sheer physical distance interposed itself much of the time between the country 's financial , business , and political leaders			1
it was an event when the great @entity69 made his way here , and most of the titans of 19th century industry never appeared at all			0
in our own era , however , the distance has shrunk , decade by decade , faster and faster all the time			0
it 's not a coincidence that the impressive new premises of the @entity81 are located across the street from @entity0 's @entity83			1
the power brokers do n't even have to hail a cab on disembarking from the @entity86			0
and now the distance has vanished to nothing , and the one - time junior partner has gained the upper hand			0
the crisis of 2008 -- and the @entity92 of 2009 -- has interpenetrated government and finance in a way never before seen in the history of the @entity18			1
the kind of proximity to power once required only by defense contractors is suddenly required by all kinds of firms			0
@entity103 will move from @entity104 to @entity0			1
the accounting firm @entity105 will consolidate operations here , as will the legal firm @entity107 as it develops a new focus upon lobbying			0
the federal government is now the majority owner of the lending arm of @entity113 , @entity114			2
it owns the nation 's largest insurance company , @entity116			2
it is banker , automaker , and lender of last , second and first resort			0
president @entity123 joked at his first @entity126 correspondents ' dinner that he had just been named @entity127			0
who would n't want to lease the office next door ? the @entity131 has acquired a portfolio of $ 1 trillion in mortgage securities			0
the government regulates salaries in the companies in which it holds interests -- and pay czar @entity138 has lamented in a television interview that his power does not extend even further			2
" the biggest disappointment , i think , is that under the statute my jurisdiction is so narrow , and so circumscribed , that i have no real direct mandatory power over other @entity146 or other national companies , " he said			0
but as @entity0 gains , the country loses			2
it loses something more than its ideals of free enterprise and private ownership			0
it loses the very @entity18 idea of a capital as a specialized locale to which specific tasks are delegated -- not an @entity18 @entity157 where favors are distributed and attendance is mandatory			1
not so long ago , @entity160 did n't even have a @entity0 office			1
today @entity160 and @entity162 are deadlocked in fiercer struggles than those that divide the oil lobby and the eco lobby			0
for those of us who reside in @entity0 , the change is mostly positive			2
certainly the restaurants are vastly improved			0
but maybe the country was better when the food in the capital was worse			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178			2

rents for offices in @entity0 could soon be more *expensive* than in @entity5
@entity178 says it 's a sign of @entity0 's *dominance* as the new financial capital of @entity18
he says long *tradition* of separating business , government centers has ended
