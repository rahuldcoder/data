-- @entity7 ' " @entity6 " may speak of " yin and yang , " but the @entity3 version of bad balanced by good might be the @entity4 and the @entity5			1
@entity7 ' " the @entity6 " was one of the year 's biggest bombs			1
the day before the @entity10 releases the @entity5 nominations -- honoring the movie industry 's best -- the @entity4 foundation reveals nominations for the @entity4 , which recognize the worst films of 2008			1
and in 2008 , @entity4 founder and self - styled " @entity17 " @entity16 said , the bad seemed to outweigh the good among the 578 movies released			2
" we are saying that it was n't just the economy that tanked , " @entity16 said			0
" so did the quality of the movies being offered to those of us who do n't have as much money to buy tickets			0
" " all of the voting was very close this year , " he said			2
" there just was too much stuff to choose from			0
" the bumper crop of " putrid motion pictures " may be partly a result of last spring 's writers ' strike " when nobody was rewriting , polishing or improving anything and it was still getting filmed , " @entity16 said			2
bombs also happen when studios hedge their bets with high - priced stars by having them " do what worked before , coming back to same well			0
" which brings us back to @entity7 ' " @entity6 , " which followed his hugely profitable " @entity47 " franchise			1
@entity7 ' portrayal of " a platitude - spouting mystic " leads the razzie list for worst picture , @entity16 said			1
it may also have been the biggest box office bomb : the film , expected to be a summer hit , lost $ 30 million , he said			0
other worst picture nominees include " @entity56 " and " @entity57 " -- both featuring the same writer - directors and essentially the same cast			2
the latter film " somehow managed to work references to @entity62 into an ancient @entity64 ' plot , ' " @entity16 said			0
also competing for the top dishonor is " @entity67 , " which @entity16 described as " an eco-disaster tale whose ' villain ' drew more guffaws than gasps , " and @entity74 's " @entity73 , " which earned three @entity4 nominations overall			1
" she really is neither a movie star or an actress , " @entity16 said of @entity76			0
the movie -- for which @entity76 was listed as executive producer -- sold only $ 27,000 in tickets but cost about $ 2 million to make			0
other @entity4 nominees include actor - comedian @entity83 , who received two nominations for " @entity85 " ; oscar winner @entity86 , who earned a @entity4 nod for making " two rotten movies this year , " in @entity16 's words ( he 's referring to " 88 minutes " and " @entity94 " ) ; and " @entity95 , " which was singled out as " @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 or @entity93			1
" despite the opinions of @entity16 and the @entity4 voters , it was the year 's third - highest - grossing movie			1
and a rare razzie for " @entity100 " will go to " @entity101 " @entity102 for " @entity103 , " @entity16 said			1
the film , based on a video game , had a $ 60 million budget , yet brought in under $ 5 million at the box office , he said			0
@entity16 said he began the @entity4 in 1981 as a counterpoint to the @entity5			1
it takes guts to show up in person to accept a @entity4 , but some notable actors have embraced the infamy , @entity16 said			2
@entity117 , who made " a horrible little thing called ' @entity119 ' " several years ago , " insisted that he made the film with the intent of sweeping the @entity4 , " @entity16 said			2
@entity117 showed up to accept his three awards with great enthusiasm , he said			0
" at the end of the ceremony , he launched into a harmonica solo and we had to pry his hands off the podium and physically remove him from the stage , " @entity16 said			0
the classiest and most memorable acceptance speech came in 2005 when @entity130 showed up to get her worst actress razzie for her " @entity133 " performance			2
@entity134 , who won a best actress @entity5 for " @entity136 " in 2001 , was given a one - minute standing ovation , @entity16 said			2
" she had her @entity5 in one hand and her @entity4 in the other , " @entity16 said			1
@entity134 's speech was a parody of her @entity5 acceptance and " she was quite funny , " he said			1
" she said that her mother had taught her that if you can not accept valid criticism , you also , by the same token , are not entitled to bask in the glory when you get the good reviews , " he said			0
the appearance and her sense of humor earned @entity134 a lot of respect , he said			0
the awards show -- a " shorter parody " of the @entity5 -- can be seen only by members and journalists in person at the @entity163 in @entity3 on february 21			1
it can not be televised or streamed online because studios would likely withhold permission for clips used in the presentation to be shown , @entity16 said			0
unlike the @entity5 and other honors , @entity4 are not meant as recommendations for people to rent the dvds , @entity16 said			1
" if you were going to do that , i would suggest you put away all sharp implements before putting the dvds in your machine , " he said .			0

@entity4 , honoring @entity3 's worst , are a counterpoint to @entity5
among this year 's leaders : @entity7 ' " the @entity6 "
" @entity101 " @entity102 will receive @entity4 for career *achievement*
