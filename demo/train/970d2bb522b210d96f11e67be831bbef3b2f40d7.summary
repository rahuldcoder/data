about a third of @entity3 parents harbor some degree of " vaccine hesitancy " that leads them to resist getting recommended vaccines			1
it 's also true that nearly a third of @entity3 think the evidence supporting climate change is shaky			2
both these beliefs can be very dangerous			0
and those of us who make and purvey science need to better understand why people distrust and reject scientific authority in this country if we 're to combat it			1
the @entity22 measles outbreak has now spread to 14 states , and physicians have not been able to raise their voices high enough above the misinformed din to head off the suffering , disability and death that could result			1
there 's not much we can do about the small core of people who oppose vaccines based on ideology : they have been with us since @entity36 first introduced his smallpox vaccine in 1798			1
but we have a better shot with the larger and more rational border zone of the vaccine hesitant who may base their concerns on genuine cases of vaccine harm , such as the very small but accepted link between influenza vaccination and a temporary paralysis called @entity48			0
part of the problem is that @entity3 see their government issuing mixed messages on the value of vaccination			0
even in the midst of the current outbreak , and just as president @entity60 was imploring parents to vaccinate their children , @entity56 governor and likely presidential contender @entity55 muddied the waters by unhelpfully asserting that parents should be given some leeway on whether to vaccinate			1
i 'll note here this is the same governor who famously erred in quarantining a returning @entity70 aid worker who showed no signs of the disease , so hopefully we 'll take his public health pronouncements in the proper context			0
whether the issue is climate change , @entity70 , or vaccine - preventable diseases like measles , each of these threats comes with a corps of true experts who must compete for the public 's attention and trust with a set of vocal charlatans , conspiracy theorists and even politicians			1
in the case of measles , a breakdown of the patient - doctor relationship is to blame			1
the @entity94 has helped erode the old paternalistic relationship just as it has diminished all authority figures , while simultaneously welcoming fringe beliefs into the mainstream			1
parents : what is your message to parents who do n't vaccinate their kids ? the @entity94 has brought down to earth the rarefied medical " priesthood " by democratizing access to its previously shrouded holy texts of medical science			1
at the same time , we doctors have injured our standing through decades of serving as willing cogs in a ballooning and inefficient medical industrial complex that took its customer base for granted			2
the teetering medical system has come crashing down in a conflagration of national debate about access , fair pricing and information sharing			0
we have witnessed the dawn of the " empowered patient , " whose self - generated and self - controlled data now offers the potential for enormous efficiency gains			1
still , we know that cultivating a strong patient - doctor relationship is the most successful method of reversing vaccine opposition			1
but doctors can no longer dictate to their patients			2
it 's not an option			0
the new role we doctors play , after all the dust is settled , is entirely built on trust			2
we are the expert consultant to whom you bring the information you have generated from your own body and your own research			0
we help you navigate your ideas and worries , and craft the concise guidance you need			0
at the same time we can not ultimately be your concierge ; we stand on the ground between our best understanding of science and its application			2
navigating that shifting territory requires winning your trust			0
it 's no coincidence that the golden age of vaccine acceptance in the mid- 20th century corresponded with some of our most fundamental medical advances and peak prestige in the medical profession			0
i do n't think we 'll ever be there again			0
you 've earned the right to question your doctor , and you may indeed bring information to the table that your doctor does n't have			2
if we can carve out a system where your doctor is granted the time to truly understand you , while at the same time allowing your doctor to treat you appropriately in the border zone between our limited science and its limitless application , we 'll build up the trust we need			1
if we 've done our job right , you 'll seek out the insights we 've earned from treating many challenging cases over many years			0
and we 'll know we 've succeeded in our new relationship when you let us vaccinate your children .			0

@entity179 : some parents have been *forgoing* measles vaccines for kids . scientists need to better understand why people reject science
he says experts now compete with @entity94 charlatans and misinformation . doctors must now *rebuild* doctor - patient bond
