-- imagine a tiny boat afloat on a thrashing sea , water pouring through a gaping hole in the hull			2
a sailor is frantically bailing dark , angry water , but no matter how much he scoops , the water line never seems to recede -- more waves just pummel him in the face like a particularly insecure middle - school bully			1
that , my friends , is our metaphor for the average worker 's e-mail inbox			2
yeah , we know , there are tons of new communication technologies out there , but e-mail still reigns supreme in the worker realm : a recent study even shows that e-mail eats up the most mobile time among @entity27			2
which is why we think it 's high time to outline some of the most annoying practices when it comes to business e-mails -- practices that might make your compatriots drown themselves in frustration			1
read on to avoid making these 10 mistakes : 1 ) " yelling " ever get an e-mail like this ? subject line : my client urgently needs to speak with you ! hot tip : when you type in all caps , you 're basically likening yourself to those crazy dudes who yell about the @entity47 on the subway ( who are perhaps a bit subdued at present )			1
yeah , no one wants to talk to you			0
2 ) going all kindergarten with your fonts remember when @entity53 spurned the @entity54 and joined forces with the @entity56 , prompting @entity54 owner @entity57 to pen a long letter on the team website tearing into @entity53 ? remember what font @entity57 used ? that 's right , @entity64 -- aka " @entity62			1
" stick to @entity65 , folks , and people will remember your sentiment instead of your poor choice of typeface			1
( to say nothing of pink fonts and @entity75 - like signatures splashed across floral graphics			0
) 3 ) @entity77 unless you are supremely stupid , senile or illiterate , there is no real excuse for getting a business contact 's name wrong , because it 's right there in his / her e-mail address			1
if you 're prone to typos , well , then , that 's what copy - paste is for			2
4 ) @entity93 as we have stated in the past -- back when we called for a brief break from the smiley -- emoticons have reached " @entity100 - like proportions since their inception , spreading from one person to another like particularly expressive herpes			2
" ok , we can see the necessity of using a placating " smiley " in an e-mail to a contact who might need a spoonful of sugar to make the " your idea sucks " medicine go down			0
but nix emoticons from any initial e-mails with new contacts			0
5 ) overly informal greetings " @entity119 ! imma tell you about a super rad product that , let 's face it , all of us gurlz should totally peep if you have a burnin ' hot love life but want to avoid burnin ' hot other things ( you know what i 'm talkin ' about ! )			2
" no one has a strong enough stomach to deal with epistles of this sort on a daily basis			0
save the @entity136 speech for when you 're old and gray and shooting off adorable , kitten - packed e-mails to your grumbling grandkids			0
they ca n't fire you for being obnoxious			0
6 ) @entity141 allow me to narrate the internal dialogue of the average desk - bound minion : " spreadsheets sure have a lot of lines ... i 'm hungry ... i hope no one notices this hickey that @entity152 from accounting gave me after @entity153 last night ...			0
i 'm hungry ... look ! there 's a blue bird outside and it cocked its head at me ! " get to the point			0
you have approximately three sentences to cut through said desk worker 's mental clutter before she -- oh , someone sent me a video of a dog hugging a turtle ! 7 ) unclear subject lines do you have important news ? then , by all means , say so in your subject line			1
hiding a vital correspondence behind a " @entity171 : hey " is not doing anyone any favors -- except for your competition			0
8 ) sending too many e-mails in a row you probably spend , oh , 20 hours per day glued to some form of computer-esque device ( soon the machines will destroy us all ) , which means that when you do n't receive an immediate response to your e-mail , it 's possible to , well overreact -- much like a clingy lover waiting for an answer on that " dinner tonight , then a different kind of spooning ? " text			1
do n't be a desperate loser			0
wait at least 24 hours before sending a follow - up e-mail , unless it 's an emergency , in which case there 's this handy thing called the phone or , you know , the five - second walk over to your co-worker 's desk			1
yeah , we know , real life communications are hard			0
9 ) clip art i imagine most of you are intelligent enough to figure out why this is not ok			0
10 ) not using the right method of contact never message a business contact on @entity209			1
why ? because @entity209 is where you go to look at pictures of people from high school when you 're drunk -- there 's even a plug - in to prevent you from ruining your social media life whilst whiskey - soaked			1
sending a business - oriented message via @entity209 is like wandering into a debauched party and expecting everyone to listen to you when you start talking about sales figures			1
if you 're having issues finding someone 's professional contact info , sure , send him / her a message on @entity209 or @entity228 asking them for that info , but do n't carry on a whole convo right then and there			1
unless you 're looking for dirt on said contact , in which case be sure to send the ol ' message at around 4 a.m. , when his defenses are down .			0

stick to @entity65 and people will remember your sentiment instead of your typeface
do n't ramble -- you have about three sentences to get a co-worker 's attention
do you have important news ? then say so in your subject line
do n't conduct business over @entity209 , which is for play time
