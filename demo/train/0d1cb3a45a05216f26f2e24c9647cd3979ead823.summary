@entity0 -- two women who say they suffered severe medical complications from a generic drug lost their @entity6 appeal thursday , essentially ending their separate lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers			1
the justices in a 5 - 4 ruling said generic drug companies do not share the same level of responsibility as makers of brand - name equivalents , to update their warning labels when significant new risks emerge			1
the financial and safety implications from the court 's ruling , could prove enormous			2
generic drugs currently account for more than 70 % of prescriptions filled in the @entity24			2
that number is expected to rise in the coming years , with patent protection due to expire on several popular and lucrative consumer drugs , including @entity28 and @entity29			2
the blockbuster health care reform bill championed by president @entity31 would also encourage greater use of generics			0
about a third of generic drugs have no brand name competitors			0
the court split along conservative - liberal lines			1
" it is beyond dispute that the federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand - name drug manufacturers are meaningfully different than those that apply to generic drug manufacturers , " said justice @entity39			1
" indeed it is the special , and different , regulation of generic drugs that allowed the generic drug market to expand , bringing drugs more quickly and cheaply to the public			1
" in dissent , justice @entity53 countered , " these divergent liability rules threaten to reduce consumer demand for generics ... nothing in the court 's opinion convinces me that , in enacting the requirement that generic labels match their corresponding brand - name labels , @entity61 intended these results			1
" justices @entity66 , @entity68 , and @entity69 supported @entity53			2
@entity72 of @entity73 and @entity74 of @entity75 both were prescribed metoclopramide -- marketed as @entity76 by @entity77 -- to treat their heartburn and acid reflux			0
their pharmacists separately filled the prescription with a generic equivalent made by @entity83 and @entity84 after four years of taking the drugs , the women each developed tardive dyskinesia , a severe longterm neurological disorder that causes involuntary muscle movements			0
they sued the generic manufacturers of the metoclopramide , claiming that inadequate warnings were provided about the long - term risks of taking the medicine			2
it was also alleged there was growing evidence of the dangers posed by the drug , but that the companies took no steps to change the warning labels			2
in 2009 , the @entity104 acted on its own and issued an order to the makers of both brand - name and generic versions of metoclopramide to add a specific warning about the increased risks of developing tardive dyskinesia			1
the generic drug makers are trying to dismiss the lawsuits			1
they cite a 1984 congressional law pre-empting state " failure - to - warn " claims			0
drug companies have long asserted various doctrines of pre-emption , saying they are protected from most product - liability claims if they have met federal safety approval standards			1
they argue that federal regulatory judgments trump state consumer safety laws , which are often tougher than @entity0 's standards			0
but the high court had given a big victory to patients and consumer rights groups in 2009 when it ruled in favor of plaintiff @entity132 , when she sued @entity77 -- now owned by @entity134 -- after losing an arm to gangrene from a common , brand - name anti-nausea prescription medication			1
she had won a $ 7 million judgment from a @entity141 jury for her claims			0
@entity39 acknowledged that from the plaintiffs ' perspective in the latest cases , " finding pre-emption here but not in @entity77 makes little sense			0
" but he added , " because pharmacists , acting in full accord with state law , substituted generic metoclopramide instead , federal law pre-empts these lawsuits			0
we acknowledge the unfortunate hand that federal drug regulation has dealt @entity158 , @entity159 and others similarly situated			0
" the majority noted @entity61 and the @entity104 , not the courts , can now change the law if they want			0
@entity53 , expressing her frustration , said , " as a result of today 's decision , whether a consumer harmed by inadequate warnings can obtain relief turns solely on the happenstance of whether her pharmacist filled her prescription with a brand - name or generic drug			1
the court gets one thing right : this outcome makes little sense			0
" the @entity180 -- representing trial attorneys -- said the ruling was " disastrous " for consumers			0
" patients will now be taking generic drugs at their own risk , " said the group 's president @entity184			0
" it is absurd that doctors and patients will have to make medical decisions knowing that only brand - name drug manufacturers -- not generics -- can be held accountable for their drugs ' dangerous side - effects			1
" but one of the generic drug makers sued applauded the high court 's decision			1
" this ruling furthers meaningful consumer protection while also safeguarding against lawsuits that threaten the availability of safe and affordable pharmaceutical products by misconstruing the labeling responsibilities of generic manufacturers , " said @entity201 ceo @entity200			2
the @entity31 administration was backing the plaintiffs , concerned that if state lawsuits are pre-empted by federal law , that will reduce the incentive for generic drug makers to provide the most current safety information to the @entity104 .			1
