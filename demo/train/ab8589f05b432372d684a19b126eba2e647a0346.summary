@entity0 -- after a five - week summer recess , @entity2 returns to a long list of unfinished business , but with 57 left days before @entity7 , it 's likely it will tackle only the bare minimum in its short fall session			1
the one must - pass measure -- a short - term continuing resolution to fund federal agencies -- will avoid any pre-election talk of a government shutdown , with which neither party wants to be tagged			1
@entity17 and @entity18 leaders struck a deal this summer on a six - month bill , but both chambers still need to pass the legislation before government funding expires at the end of this month			1
the @entity25 is expected vote on the bill thursday , and two @entity17 leadership aides predict it will get a sizable bipartisan majority			1
a senior @entity31 @entity18 aide tells @entity1 the @entity31 is expected to approve the measure next week			1
rep. @entity33 , the third - ranking @entity17 leader in the @entity25 , did not directly answer whether a majority of @entity35 would vote for the stopgap spending bill , but said , " i expect that bill to be a bipartisan vote , and i expect the @entity31 to pass it as well and not add anything to it			1
" what could move -- it 's possible that @entity17 and @entity18 leaders could work out a deal on a farm bill to reform agriculture programs and provide some relief to drought - stricken states -- or at least agree to another short - term extension of the current law , according to multiple congressional aides			1
if they ca n't reconcile differences between the two varying approaches taken by the @entity25 and @entity31 , some money for drought assistance , plus some money for states affected by recent natural disasters , could be tacked onto the spending bill			0
@entity33 , who represents some agricultural interests in his @entity62 district , told reporters monday he 's still pressing to pass a bill before the election			1
he acknowledged to reporters on @entity67 that " the time frame is tough , " but " it 's our intent to get it done			0
" long , hot summer sends food prices soaring -- the @entity31 will return and work on a veterans jobs bill this week			2
@entity31 @entity73 are also considering action this month on a housing bill that president @entity76 included on his congressional " to do " list earlier this summer , but @entity25 @entity17 have n't expressed any desire to act on it			2
-- some key provisions of the federal wiretapping bill known as @entity81 that was created after the 9/11 terror attacks under president @entity83 are due to expire at the end of the year , and @entity2 is expected to pass an extension of the current law			1
@entity25 @entity17 have slated a vote this week to renew the current law for another five years			2
likely to be punted the roughly eight - week sprint to @entity7 means several major measures that lawmakers have failed to make any progress on over the summer will continue to languish on @entity67			1
these include some issues that both parties say they want to address but will have little motivation to compromise on : the renewal of the @entity97 , a bill providing new cybersecurity protections and legislation to reform the postal service , which recently defaulted on payments to the @entity103 for employee health plans			1
in each case , the proposal favored by the @entity17 - led @entity25 is at odds with the bills in the @entity109 - controlled @entity31			2
a divided @entity2 means these issues will be punted into the lame duck session after the election , or even postponed until next year			1
less legislating and more campaign messaging while there wo n't be much legislating , congressional aides say the messages from leaders and rank - and - file members on @entity67 will echo the campaign themes of @entity76 and @entity17 presidential candidate @entity121 , particularly when it comes to the economy and jobs			1
on his first post-convention stop in @entity126 on friday , @entity76 prodded voters to urge @entity2 to pass his jobs legislation			2
" if the @entity35 are serious about being concerned about joblessness , we could create a million new jobs right now if @entity2 would pass the jobs plan that i sent to them a year ago -- jobs for teachers , jobs for construction workers , jobs for folks who have been looking for work for a long time			1
we can do that , " @entity76 said			0
@entity141 , a spokesman for @entity25 speaker @entity142 , emphasized that the @entity25 @entity17 has already approved legislation aimed at helping the economy			0
" @entity25 has done its job			0
we 've passed more than 30 jobs bills			0
" @entity147 : august jobs report comes in weak noting that @entity25 @entity17 have also passed a bill to undo the automatic spending cuts scheduled to go into effect in january and extend all the current tax rates , @entity141 added , " we are ready to act on all of those measures if the president and @entity31 @entity73 would show some courage to work with on those things with us			2
" @entity121 continues to highlight the @entity76 administration 's failed loan to the now - bankrupt energy company @entity159			0
@entity25 @entity17 will keep the issue out front with a vote this week on a bill to eliminate the federal loan guarantee program that funded several energy start - ups			1
dubbed the " no more @entity166 , " the @entity17 bill is expected to pass mostly along party lines , but wo n't move in the @entity31			1
one open question is whether @entity17 vice presidential nominee rep. @entity170 of @entity171 will return to the @entity67 for any part of the september session			0
under @entity171 law , @entity170 is allowed to also run for his @entity25 seat , so he may feel pressure to take a break from barnstorming battleground states to vote on the bipartisan deal to keep the government funded			0
@entity33 told reporters monday that @entity170 would be back in @entity0 on thursday to vote on the continuing resolution , and a @entity121 campaign official confirmed that			2
the six - month spending bill keeps the government funded at the level agreed to in last summer 's debt deal -- $ 1.047 trillion			2
but after criticism from a bloc of conservative @entity35 that the deal did n't cut spending fast enough , @entity170 introduced a budget that moved the overall spending level about $ 20 billion lower to $ 1.028 trillion			0
that budget passed the @entity25 , but was immediately rejected by @entity73 as violating the bipartisan debt deal			0
asked how @entity170 would vote this week on the funding bill , @entity33 initially told reporters he expected @entity170 to support it , but when pressed about the spending level , he said he had indications his @entity17 colleague would vote for it , but he could n't speak for other members			1
an aide to @entity170 did not respond when asked by @entity1 whether the congressman planned to vote for the six - month spending bill			0
what wo n't get done -- a deal to avoid the ' fiscal cliff ' @entity2 faces a " fiscal cliff " at the end of this year -- the combination of the deep automatic cuts to federal agencies scheduled to go into effect in january that were part of last summer 's debt deal and the expiration of the " @entity83 era " tax cuts at the end of december			1
economists and budget experts warn that a failure by the divided @entity2 to come to some agreement on significant deficit reduction and tax policy before the end of the year could trigger another recession			0
but neither side expects anything more than symbolic action on those issues until after the election			0
new @entity231 book goes in depth on debt battle on friday , the @entity234 missed a deadline to submit a report to @entity2 that details which government programs would face cuts as part of the sequestration in january , but @entity234 press secretary @entity242 told reporters the report would go to @entity245 this week			2
@entity25 @entity17 passed a plan earlier this year without any @entity18 support that shielded the @entity248 from any cuts and replaced the across - the - board reductions prescribed in the debt deal with other mandatory spending cuts to food stamp and other domestic programs			1
although the majority of @entity35 voted for these spending cuts that were included in last summer 's compromise to raise the debt ceiling , there has been a @entity17 push in recent months to blame the @entity76 administration and paint democrats as responsible for any impact the cuts would have on the military			2
over the weekend , @entity121 criticized @entity76 for proposing the cuts as a mechanism to broker the debt deal , saying " it was a mistake for @entity17 to go along with it			0
" @entity121 explains why he thinks @entity17 made mistake to reinforce that they now oppose the massive cuts to the military that sequestration would set in motion , the @entity25 @entity17 is scheduling another vote on the issue next week			0
the new bill would replace the mandatory cuts with their alternate set of reductions and again calls for the @entity234 to explain how it will implement spending reductions			0
perhaps what promises to be the only truly bipartisan moment in @entity2 this fall is this tuesday 's ceremony to mark the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks			0
as has become custom each year on the date , @entity25 and @entity31 leaders from both parties will assemble on the @entity67 steps to sing " @entity294			0
" that 9/11 ceremony , along with two others awarding @entity297 to golf great @entity299 and @entity301 human rights activist @entity300 , will be rare breaks from the heated campaign rhetoric on @entity67 that 's aimed at influencing voters ' choices in november .			0

@entity2 returns from five - week recess with just 57 days until election
a short - term continuing resolution to fund federal agencies is expected to pass
@entity97 , cybersecurity bill likely to be punted
it 's possible @entity17 and @entity18 leaders could work out a deal on a farm bill
