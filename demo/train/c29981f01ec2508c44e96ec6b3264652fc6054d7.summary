-- he is self coached , he relies on @entity4 videos to hone his technique -- and in running - mad @entity6 , he had to plead with officials to win selection for the track and field team as a javelin thrower			1
@entity11 may not have won a medal at the @entity13 but his achievement in just qualifying and then reaching the final in this specialist discipline was a triumph over adversity			1
" i do not have a coach , my motivation comes from within			0
training without a coach is not an easy thing , " he told @entity0 's @entity23 series			0
but this obvious handicap did not prevent him hurling the 800 - gram spear 81.81 meters -- his personal best , breaking his own national record -- in qualifying in @entity31 to join his sport 's elite			2
@entity11 eventually finished 12th in the final behind @entity35 of @entity36 , who shocked the likes of two - time defending champion @entity38 of @entity39 to win a surprise gold			1
@entity35 's upset victory , only the second by a non-european in @entity45 javelin competition , should act as encouragement to @entity11 , who is not short of self belief			1
" i want to be a legend and leave a legacy , " he said			0
" my focus now is on the 2013 @entity51 in @entity52			2
i am trying to be in the top three			0
i have to move into the medal bracket , not just in the finals			2
" @entity11 had to battle " a lot of challenges " to gain acceptance in his own country as a world - class athlete			1
the 23 - year - old hails from a village in the @entity63 , the traditional breeding ground for the seemingly endless stream of @entity6 distance runners who have enjoyed such success in distances from 800 meters to the marathon			1
the fourth child in a family of nine , he took up the javelin at secondary school when he realized he was n't going to be a successful footballer			0
" my first - born sister used to encourage me , my mum also , but my dad sometimes was angry with me , " @entity11 said			1
" most of my time i was going out of school , no learning , so he was a bit angry with me			0
but after i proved him wrong he let me continue with this sport			0
" @entity11 briefly dabbled with the track , but at a stocky 85 kg his physique is more suited to an event like the javelin and its incredible technical demands			1
it helped that an elder brother was also a javelin thrower at their elementary school , and he was also inspired by watching the @entity94 on the television			2
" it just took me , i wanted to be like @entity38 , " he said			0
little could he have realized that eight years later , @entity11 would be competing against his hero in an @entity45 final			1
with no specialist javelin coaches in @entity6 , the then teenager turned to technology to see what @entity38 and other great champions such as @entity104 @entity103 were doing			1
" i watched @entity4 and it really paid off for me , to see the training techniques and skills they are using , " he said			2
@entity11 first made his mark with third place at the 2010 @entity112 championships in @entity6 's capital of @entity114 , but disappointment followed at the @entity116 in @entity117 later that year as he was well below his best in finishing seventh			1
his big breakthrough came in 2011 at the @entity120 , but he nearly did not make it to the championships in @entity123 , which were to prove pivotal to his career and eventual qualification for the @entity13			1
@entity11 was initially told he would be going with the @entity6 team to the event , but three days later came the shattering news that he would not be making the trip			1
" i rang one of the officials in our federation and i asked what was happening , " he recalls			0
" he told me we do n't have enough cash to accommodate all of you , so i told him you can remove one of the runners so you can give me a chance ! " @entity11 's confrontation with officialdom clearly struck a chord , and three days later he was reinstated on the team			2
he repaid their faith with a national record of 78.20m to become the first @entity6 to win javelin gold at the @entity120			2
it also led to an invite from the @entity153 , the world governing body of track and field , to go on a six - month scholarship to its center in @entity160 , @entity161 , the traditional home of javelin			1
returning in the spring of 2012 , @entity11 achieved the qualifying mark for the @entity13 and threw further than 80m for the first time later in the summer			1
now he could not be ignored by the @entity6 selectors and his dream was about to become reality , admittedly as the only field event athlete in a 44 - strong team			1
" my @entity45 experience is something i will never forget			0
i 'm an @entity171 now , not everyone can be @entity171 , " he said			0
like many top @entity6 athletes , @entity11 has a job with the national police force , but is allowed ample time to train between four to five hours per day , working on specialist exercises in the gym , jumps over hurdles and a throwing routine			1
" @entity181 requires a combination of speed , skill and power , and if you do n't combine all of them , you can not get it right , " he said			0
" i was born with the talent , but the skills i have had to work on			0
" @entity38 remains his reference point			0
" @entity38 is a unique guy , he 's very skilful , " @entity11 said			2
" he does some gymnastics ( in training ) you can not do			0
" when i watch his squats he 's doing almost 200 kg and i was doing 90 , so you can see it 's a very big range , but now i 'm doing 150			0
" when i read his biography , he started training when he was just 11 , so you can see he 's far ahead of everybody			0
" still battling the lack of specialist facilities , @entity11 goes it alone , spending hours every day training at the @entity204 stadium in @entity114			2
" what i love about the javelin , when you throw and you hit it right , when it 's flying in the sky , you feel so nice			0

@entity11 is first @entity6 to qualify for a field event at the @entity13
@entity11 reached javelin final at 2012 @entity214 and finished 12th
the 23 - year - old is targeting a medal at the 2013 world championships
he *refined* his technique by watching videos on @entity4
