@entity0 -- a @entity3 church that attracted nationwide attention for its angry , anti-gay protests at the funerals of @entity8 military members has won its appeal at the @entity10 , an issue testing the competing constitutional rights of free speech and privacy			1
the justices , by an 8 - 1 vote , said wednesday that members of @entity18 had a right to promote what they call a broad - based message on public matters such as wars			1
the father of a fallen @entity25 had sued the small church , saying those protests amounted to targeted harassment and an intentional infliction of emotional distress			1
it can stir people to action , move them to tears of both joy and sorrow , and -- as it did here -- inflict great pain			0
on the facts before us , we can not react to that pain by punishing the speaker , " chief justice @entity41 wrote for the majority			2
at issue was a delicate test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free speech rights of demonstrators , however disturbing and provocative their message			0
several states have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the church members can protest			1
the church , led by pastor @entity59 , believes @entity60 is punishing the @entity8 for " the sin of homosexuality " through events including soldiers ' deaths			1
members have traveled the country shouting at grieving families at funerals and displaying such signs as " thank @entity60 for dead soldiers , " " @entity60 blew up the troops " and " @entity73 cures fags			1
" @entity18 members had appeared outside the 2006 funeral for @entity78 @entity77 in @entity79 , @entity80 , outside @entity81			1
@entity77 's family sued the church in 2007 , alleging invasion of privacy , intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy			1
a jury awarded the family $ 2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $ 8 million in punitive damages , which were later reduced to $ 5 million			0
the church appealed the case in 2008 to a federal appeals court , which reversed the judgments a year later , siding with the church 's allegations that its first amendment rights were violated			2
@entity100 , @entity77 's father , said his son was not gay and the protesters should not have been at the funeral			1
" i was just shocked that any individual could do this to another human being , " @entity77 told @entity1 last fall			0
" i mean , it was inhuman			0
" in an afternoon news conference wednesday , @entity77 expressed surprise at the ruling			0
" my first thought was that eight justices do n't have the common sense that @entity60 gave a goat , " he said			1
" we found out today that we can no longer bury our dead in this county with dignity			0
" he added , " what is this country coming to ? " @entity121 , a member of the @entity18 clan and an attorney who argued the case before the high court , told @entity1 the ruling was " 10 times better than i had hoped for			1
" " you ca n't use the subject that your feelings are hurt to trump public debate , " she said			2
if that were the case , " where would we be ? " she promised that with this ruling in hand , @entity18 would conduct more such pickets			1
church members say their broader message is aimed at the unspecified actions of the military and those who serve in it			1
they believe @entity8 soldiers deserve to die because they fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality			2
@entity41 in his opinion noted the @entity77 family was not a " captive audience " to the protests that were conducted several hundred yards away			2
" @entity18 stayed well away from the memorial service , " wrote @entity41			1
" @entity77 could see no more than the tops of the signs when driving to the funeral			0
and there is no indication that the picketing itself in any way interfered with the funeral itself			0
" based on that the court concluded @entity77 could not collect damages from @entity18			2
but the chief justice showed little sympathy for the message @entity18 promotes			0
" @entity18 believes that @entity8 is morally flawed ; many @entity8 might feel the same about @entity18			1
@entity18 's funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its contribution to public discourse may be negligible , " he said			1
however , " as a nation we have chosen a different course -- to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate			1
" the ruling was a narrow one , dealing with the specific , unusual facts of this appeal			0
such vocal protests at military funerals are almost entirely confined to this one small group			0
@entity41 said on the free speech question , it was enough to rely on " limited principles that sweep no more broadly than the appropriate context of the instant case			1
" only justice @entity189 dissented			0
he said the church 's " outrageous conduct caused petitioner great injury , and the court now compounds that injury by depriving petitioner of a judgment that acknowledges the wrong he suffered , " he said			0
" in order to have a society in which public issues can be openly and vigorously debated , it is not necessary to allow the brutalization of innocent victims like petitioner			1
" the @entity10 has never addressed the specific issue of laws designed to protect the " sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services , " as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased			0
but the high court has recognized the state 's interest in protecting people from unwanted protests or communications while in their homes			0
the justices were being asked to address how far states and private entities like cemeteries and churches can go to justify picket - free zones and the use of " floating buffers " to silence or restrict the speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting			2
a majority of states across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the @entity18 church protesters			2
in wednesday 's case , 48 states and dozens of members of @entity243 filed an amicus brief in support of the @entity247			0
@entity248 , chairman of @entity249 , said the military protects the @entity252 rights that members of @entity18 use to protest			2
" @entity255 families deserve the respect of a grateful nation , not hate from a group who chooses to demonstrate during the funeral of their loved one , " he said			0
" my family has been on the receiving end of their hate and i assure all @entity255 families , this group is an anomaly and your sacrifice does not go without notice			0
" @entity18 members told the court they have a duty to protest and picket at certain events , including funerals , to promote their religious message : " that @entity60 's promise of love and heaven for those who obey him in this life is counterbalanced by @entity60 's wrath and hell for those who do not obey him			1
" the congregation is made up mostly of @entity59 and his family			0
the pastor has 13 children , and at least 54 grandchildren and seven great - grandchildren			0
he described himself as an " old - time " gospel preacher in a @entity1 interview in 2006 , saying , " you ca n't preach the @entity294 without preaching the hatred of @entity60			2
" church members have participated in several hundred protests across the country			1
in 2009 , the high court blocked @entity301 's effort to enforce a specific law aimed at the @entity18			2
@entity121 , daughter @entity303 and other church members had protested near the august 2005 funeral of a soldier in @entity307 , @entity301			1
state lawmakers later passed the " spc. @entity309 , " criminalizing picketing " in front of or about " a funeral location or procession			0
the case decided wednesday is @entity314 ( 09 - 751 ) .			0
