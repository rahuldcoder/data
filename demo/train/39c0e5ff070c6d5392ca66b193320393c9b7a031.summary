-- it 's a shame that @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 ca n't experience the transformation of @entity6 and @entity7 from the dark days of @entity9 's assassination in 1963 to the outpouring of tribute to him taking shape as the 50th anniversary approaches			1
people have debated for decades since that tragic day whether @entity6 was " a city of hate " that brought about his murder			1
certainly some factors contributed to that perception : then - vice presidential candidate @entity20 and his wife , @entity21 , were spat on during the 1960 presidential campaign , and @entity25 ambassador @entity24 was struck during a speaking appearance only weeks before the presidential visit			0
the latter episode resulted in a @entity30 headline : " a @entity31			0
" regardless of the validity or fairness of the accusation , the consequences were swift and brutal			0
the die of public opinion had been cast			0
for years , the city would endure a bitter stigma			1
it took long , agonizing decades for @entity6 to deal with that burden			1
today 's observers will find it hard to conceive the harshness of scorn that ensued			2
because i was a witness to the assassination from the @entity49 press bus in the motorcade , i still remember vividly the shock and heartbreak of the moment , and the bitterness afterward			2
mayor @entity55 received death threats from strangers			2
@entity6 businessmen were bodily thrown out of @entity61 taxicabs			1
a direct mail businesswoman was forced to change her mailing address to @entity64 , a nearby community , after orders plummeted			0
then , encouraging signs of recovery began to appear			0
on the political front , @entity69 was drafted to become mayor , and forged an ambitious " goals for @entity6 " agenda to refocus and move the city out of its malaise			1
his strong leadership is credited for @entity6 being named an @entity78 seven years later			1
beyond the lofty civic initiatives , the city 's image was bolstered by two unexpected sources			1
one was the spectacular performance of quarterback @entity84 , which led to the @entity86 being called " @entity87			0
" the other was worldwide fascination with " @entity6 , " the tv soap opera so popular that a @entity6 reporter remembers a well - educated @entity93 interviewee asking whether he knew the @entity94 , the mythical tv show family			1
despite the benefit of these distractions from @entity9 's death , the city resisted coming to grips with the historical reality that rocked the world			1
most dallasites preferred to forget			0
the local @entity104 , which stages an annual review of news highlights of the preceding year , did not include a single word about the assassination in its show the next spring			1
many advocated bulldozing the @entity111			0
county of @entity6 engineer @entity113 saved the building by engineering its purchase and rehabilitation , providing space for a fitting memorial			2
@entity119 and her allies helped realize that goal			0
after years of fits and starts , the @entity122 opened its doors in 1989 , and today is home to authoritative historical archives surrounding the @entity9 tragedy , including more than 1,100 oral histories			1
fifty years after the trauma it suffered , @entity6 is a vibrant city that boasts a host of @entity133 companies , an active arts scene and a growing population and economy			1
but until now , the city itself never has officially come to peace with the event			0
@entity6 has set a tone of quiet dignity and grace to observe the 50th anniversary of president @entity9 's death on friday , november 22			1
mayor @entity146 adopted an enlightened pre-emptive strategy more than a year ago to marginalize would - be sensationalists and conspiracy mongers who might seek to dominate the milestone			0
thus , more than 1,000 journalists from around the world will experience a simple one - hour ceremony to honor the memory of president @entity9 in an address by noted historian @entity157			2
more than 5,000 attendees who won standing - room - only free admission will view proceedings within a secured area of @entity162 , site of the assassination			0
next door , the @entity122 will offer its vast resources , along with a series of special programs , to the tide of journalists , researchers and the general public expected to descend on the city			0
the city 's initiative has led to the organic rise of other notable gestures across @entity7 in the weeks ahead			2
at nearby @entity178 , an eight - foot bronze statue of @entity9 stands in @entity179 , the site where @entity9 spoke to thousands in a misting rain hours before he was killed			2
a few miles west of downtown , the @entity181 will show fine art that had hung in the @entity185 ' suite at the @entity7 the night before his death			0
the @entity189 and the @entity190 at nearby @entity64 both offer extensive exhibitions of photographs from @entity9 visits to @entity178 and @entity6			1
to the south , the @entity194 in @entity195 offers exhibits on the assassination , @entity20 's ascension to the presidency and his tenure as the nation 's new leader			2
visitors can hear @entity21 's tape - recorded diary from several days surrounding the tragedy			0
sixty miles to the west of @entity195 , the @entity207 offers free admission to the @entity7 @entity49 of the 1960s			0
although @entity6 and @entity7 never can erase the heartbreak of that day in 1963 , this mosaic of honor should touch the hearts of those who mourn the passing of @entity9 , and help the nation and the world finally come to peace with that tragic time in our history			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			2

@entity225 : since the @entity9 assassination in 1963 , @entity6 has changed
he says @entity6 was targeted as " a city of hate " that brought about @entity9 's murder
read : @entity6 has *avoided* *acknowledging* the assassination over the years
read : this year , city hosts @entity9 tributes marking 50th anniversary of his death
