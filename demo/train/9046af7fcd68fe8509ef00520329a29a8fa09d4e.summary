@entity0 , @entity1 -- ten years ago , @entity4 leaders met outside @entity0 , @entity1 , to lay out a road map to establish and sustain @entity4 's government after the fall of the @entity8			1
on monday , the nation 's president for the last seven years , @entity9 , will once again preside over a conference in the west @entity1 city to chart his nation 's future			1
yet this time , as opposed to just @entity20 representatives facilitating the 2001 conference for a group of @entity4 exiles and leaders , members of 85 delegations from various countries and 15 international organizations will join @entity4 in the discussions			1
their goal is to take stock of accomplishments and assess continued challenges in @entity4 over the past decade , as well as to plot a partnership with the @entity32 government amid plans to withdraw all foreign combat troops from the country by 2014			1
there has , admittedly , been notable progress in recent years			0
@entity4 's economy has grown , albeit it at a slow rate			2
despite reported corruption , @entity4 has moved away from the repressive extremist rule of the @entity8 and toward a more democratic political system , in which @entity4 vote for their leaders			1
and the status of women -- strictly controlled under the @entity8 -- has improved with a constitutional commitment guaranteeing equality , and 3 million girls are now in school			0
but the international community knows many of these gains hang by a thread			0
as it was in 2001 , @entity4 is still one of the world 's poorest and corrupt nations			2
even as international troops seek to wind down their involvement , the country faces a resilient @entity8 insurgency , political instability and economic turmoil			0
attendees at this @entity0 conference are expected to address prospects for long - term aid for @entity4			1
that could well include a promise of substantial resources from the international community , given concerns @entity4 's economic stability may suffer after international troops leave and funding levels dwindle			1
@entity9 is officially in charge of the conference , seeking to demonstrate ownership over his nation 's own affairs			2
@entity4 officials are expected to make extensive presentations on plans to assume responsibility of security from @entity83 - led forces over the next three years and efforts to forge a political settlement with the @entity8 , which some see as key to establishing security across the country			1
yet even with @entity4 's ambitious plans to become self - sufficient in political and security matters , few expect it will be truly independent -- especially economically -- beyond the 2014 transition			1
@entity94 and @entity95 analyses state that the security situation will be pivotal to @entity4 's ability to grow its economy			2
they estimate the withdrawal of troops and a resulting loss of foreign aid could reduce @entity4 's growth rate by 50 % or more -- something the @entity94 warned could cause the @entity4 economy to collapse			0
the @entity95 has introduced its own plan , developed in coordination with the @entity4 government , to shore up the @entity4 economy			0
@entity111 hopes that increasing investment in @entity4 's private sector and developing the country 's agricultural and mining sectors will help the nation become less reliant on the @entity95			0
@entity95 officials acknowledge that it will be difficult for @entity4 to make more progress economically , unless the governance and security situations improve			2
there are also other challenges , like the fact @entity4 still ranks among the world 's lowest literacy and health rates -- factors that make it difficult to find skilled laborers need to fuel industry			2
another problem is the state of @entity4 's infrastructure			0
one focus is to integrate @entity4 's economy with its neighbors in south and central @entity140 , thus bolstering @entity4 's self - sufficiency			0
to that end , the @entity95 has introduced the @entity144 initiative to promote @entity4 as a hub for the free movement of goods , services , capital and people in the region			0
the elephant in the room at @entity0 -- or , more accurately , not in the room -- will be neighboring @entity155			0
@entity156 opted not to send any representatives to the conference last week in reaction to november 27 cross-border strike by @entity83 that killed 24 of its soldiers			0
it has also closed @entity83 supply lines into @entity4 in retaliation for the attack			0
@entity155 is viewed as a critical player in the region , because of its perceived relationships with the @entity8 and other insurgency groups -- some of whom are based within @entity155 borders , from where they launch attacks on @entity4 and foreign troops			1
@entity155 's government , itself , has argued for a larger role in regional efforts to stabilize the country and broker peace with the @entity8			0
@entity111 had hoped the @entity0 conference would produce momentum for peace talks with the @entity8 , but reconciliation efforts have stalled since the september assassination of @entity187 , a former @entity4 president who was his government 's chief negotiator in talks with insurgents			1
those efforts have been further stymied by @entity155 's decision not to go to @entity1			1
@entity95 secretary of state @entity193 , who arrived in @entity0 on sunday night , has called @entity155 's decision to drop out of the conference " regrettable " and even called @entity155 prime minister @entity195 to ask his government to reconsider			2
still , @entity95 officials -- at least publicly -- refuse to admit @entity155 will play spoiler either at the @entity0 conference or in the larger @entity95 - led plans to stabilize @entity4 and bring forces home .			1
