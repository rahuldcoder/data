-- in " @entity1 : motherhood , @entity10 , and the reality of the @entity13 , " i explore many @entity4 lies , one of which is that women can delay motherhood until we 're ready and if we 're not able to get pregnant naturally , then science will make it happen for us			1
another @entity1 i write about is that we do n't need feminism anymore			1
in a way , these are two sides of the same lie			2
in the book , i make a strong argument for why we need feminism more than ever			1
the language of the biological clock has been around for decades , but conflicting or misleading messages persist			2
i believe it is the very role of feminists to arm women with knowledge so that they can make better choices to take control of their future			1
some people claim that no one is unaware of the impact of age on fertility			1
a @entity37 public survey in 2012 showed that only 18.2 % of respondents accurately guessed how many couples are affected by fertility problems , and 28.1 % did n't know that fertility declines rapidly in women after age 35			1
in addition , 68.4 % of survey respondents were n't aware that as part of a couple , both men and women are equally likely to be infertile			1
we should be getting this knowledge from our health educators and doctors , and we should be getting it earlier , possibly during sex education			0
' @entity1 ' in putting off pregnancy headlines continue to distort the reality			0
just last week , @entity56 ran a piece with the title , " new study suggests biological - clock frenzy is bulls -- t. " among the actual findings of the study , by the @entity62 , is that while the use of infertility services had declined between 2006 and 2010 , white women with higher education levels and household income were the ones more likely to use such services			1
as sociology professor @entity73 , whom i also interviewed for my book , said to @entity76 , " women , and especially middle - class white women , are delaying having a first child even longer than before			1
part of that reason may be because they have confidence that infertility treatments , when they need them , will work			0
for a lot of them , it 's a false confidence because the treatments work better when you 're young			0
" i started writing " @entity1 " after my third miscarriage in 2011 ; my first was three years earlier , when i was 37			0
since my book came out , i 've seen comments along the lines of , " just because she failed does n't mean others will			0
i have a friend who had two kids naturally in her 40s			0
" and maybe they will succeed , but they should know that they will be pushing back against tougher and tougher odds			0
as it happens , my doctors were clear that the biggest factor was my age			1
the pathologies from my first two miscarriages showed chromosomal abnormalities ( by age 40 , half our eggs are chromosomally abnormal ; by age 42 , that figure is 90 % ) ; the third was a blighted ovum -- which happens when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus but the embryo does n't develop			1
i believe we are at a critical juncture where women of my generation are hitting our 40s and realizing that while many of us do n't have children by choice , many of us do n't have them because we waited too long			1
@entity129 women having fewer children we have been a guinea - pig generation when it comes to delaying fertility			1
according to a @entity135 study that was conducted in 2008 , nearly one in five @entity129 women had ended her childbearing years without having a child , compared with one in 10 in the 1970s			1
of course , there are many paths to parenthood and one of the objectives of my book is to encourage people to pursue those options ( surrogacy , egg donation and freezing , single parenthood , etc. )			0
also , adoption : there are more than 100,000 children waiting to be adopted in the @entity129 alone			1
in 2012 , there were about 400,000 children in foster care			0
however , many of the options are costly , and we can not separate conversations about the pursuit of parenthood from the economics of it			0
according to a 2012 report from the @entity129 @entity167 , it costs about $ 235,000 to raise a child for the first 17 years			2
when you factor in fertility treatments or adoption costs , etc. , many people simply ca n't afford to have children			2
i believe we have to make parenthood a more attainable goal by incorporating more fundamental fertility awareness in sex education and by providing more support through guaranteed parental leave , widespread insurance coverage for fertility treatments , subsidized childcare , etc. i intended my book to be a conversation - starter and policy - changer			1
i explore how various factors , including feminism 's early victories and advances in reproductive science , dovetailed to create an atmosphere in which women believed their timetables for motherhood were more within their controls			1
ultimately , though , " @entity1 " is a feminist book , intended to get women to push past the rhetoric and to arm themselves with information			2
five questions on egg freezing one point of feminism , after all , has always been to push back against the sort of magical thinking that tells a woman that someone will be there to come to the rescue , whether a husband or a fertility doctor			1
that mind - set holds us back from solutions ; we have to balance the heartbreaking scenarios with the optimistic ones			2
feminism provides a framework within which to argue for solutions to many of the issues that cut across geographic and economic lines			2
when i started telling my story , i was shocked to discover how many others had stories to tell , too -- if not about themselves , it was about a friend , mother , daughter , etc. a 2009 survey of infertility patients by pharmaceutical giant @entity233 revealed that 61 % hide the struggle to get pregnant from friends and family			0
i am hopeful that my book will encourage others to normalize the discourse			0
i 've received dozens of e-mails and read many more comments by those for whom some aspect of my story rings true			0
i am certainly not the only woman to have multiple miscarriages			0
i 'm not the only woman whose marriage was a casualty of the process			0
and i 'm not the only woman to feel like maybe i waited too long to try to have a biological child			2
nor am i the first to write about all these			0
there are excellent books by @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and more			0
i 've been inspired by those who turn adversity into action			0
@entity259 @entity258 wrote in her memoir , " @entity261 , " " there are uses to adversity , and they do n't reveal themselves until tested ... difficulty can tap unsuspected strengths			0
" in my case , i took what i learned from my mistakes and from my experience with delayed motherhood and used it as a starting point to interview dozens of women of various ages , sociologists , adoption counselors , and fertility doctors about their opinions			1
the result is a book that i hope will help others			0
i explore the choices that women have to make during the course of their lives -- including the choice to have children or not			2
women and men need to share their stories , educate themselves , strategize for their goals , advocate for a better future -- and not to be afraid of feminism			1
women do n't need any more @entity297			2
the opinions expressed are solely those of @entity299			1
