-- the @entity4 has granted a member of a religious minority permission to keep his turban , beard and uncut hair while he serves in the military , the @entity1 and a group representing him said			1
capt. @entity11 , a doctor , is a @entity12 , a faith that calls on its adherents not to shave or cut their hair			1
@entity11 filed a request in the spring for an accommodation to follow the principles of his religion			1
this month the @entity4 granted his request , the @entity20 told @entity0			1
the @entity1 public affairs office later confirmed that @entity11 would be allowed to keep his turban , beard and uncut hair			2
the civil rights group hailed the move as " a major step toward ending a 23 - year - old policy that excludes @entity12 from service			1
" @entity11 said he was " overjoyed			2
" " like the many sikhs who fought before me , i know i will serve @entity32 with honor and excellence , " he said in a written statement			0
but the @entity20 provided what it said was a copy of the letter from the @entity4			1
maj. gen. @entity38 said in the letter that @entity11 's " beard , uncut hair , and turban will be neat and well maintained at all times			1
" she said her ruling applies only to @entity11 's case , and is not a change of @entity4 policy			1
" this accommodation is based solely on the facts and circumstances of your case , " the letter said			2
" this accommodation does not constitute a blanket accommodation for any other individual			0
" she said the exception could be revoked " due to changed conditions			0
" her letter was dated october 22 and released by the @entity20 the next day			1
@entity11 is not the only @entity12 asking permission to keep his hair , beard and turban while serving in the @entity4			1
capt. @entity65 , a dentist , applied at the same time as @entity11			1
his case has been deferred until he receives the results of his dental board examinations , the @entity20 told @entity0			2
both were scheduled to report for active duty in july			0
the @entity20 said @entity11 and @entity65 had been assured when they were recruited to join the @entity4 's @entity72 that their unshorn hair and turbans " would not be a problem			1
" " both are concluding their training and are slated to begin active duty in july 2009			0
however , the @entity4 is now disputing their ability to serve with their @entity12 identity intact , " the @entity20 said in an april 14 letter addressed to defense secretary @entity79			1
" it does n't make sense to me , especially in these hard times , " @entity11 told @entity0 at the time			2
" the military is hurting for professionals			0
they need doctors , they need nurses			0
" @entity90 , the head of the @entity20 , told @entity0 in the spring that the issue affects observant @entity12 , not those @entity12 - @entity32 who entered the military after removing their turbans and shaving their beards and hair			1
the issue is important for the roughly 500,000 - strong @entity32 @entity12 community , @entity90 said			2
@entity12 faced hostility after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , when people associated them with @entity102 terrorists because their turbans and beards resembled the militants ' appearance			2
the @entity12 religion was founded in @entity108			1
" the perception is still there , " @entity90 said			0
" we 're sort of still feeling it			0
" he said surveys chronicle the problems @entity12 face			0
among them is one conducted in the @entity119 borough of @entity120 recently in which children reported being on the receiving end of verbal and physical abuse , he said			0
" these kids are being harassed in @entity120			0
it 's @entity119 , the most diverse county in the @entity32			0
if this is happening in @entity119 , it 's happening in other parts of the country			0
" so , he said , the opportunity to serve in the @entity4 sends the opposite message -- " that we are part and parcel of the fabric of this country			0
" @entity0 's @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity142 , contributed to this report .			0
