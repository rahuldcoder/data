defense lawyers have argued that " the vast majority of the funds in question are in an independently managed trust " that @entity2 and his attorneys can not access directly			0
" the audio recordings of mr. @entity2 's phone conversation while in jail make it clear that mr. @entity2 knew a significant sum had been raised by his original fundraising website , " attorneys said last week			0

the gravity of this mistake has been distinctly illustrated , and mr. @entity2 understands that this mistake has undermined his credibility , which he will have to work to repair			0
" the attorneys said @entity2 did disclose the existence of the funds five days after the bond hearing , during his first conversation with the defense about the fund			2
" when the defense team learned of the funds , we disclosed this to the court and to the @entity134 , and the money was transferred to the @entity136 , which is now independently managed , " the defense said			0
of the $ 204,000 raised by the website , about $ 150,000 is now in the defense fund and $ 30,000 was used " to make the complicated transition from private life in @entity29 , @entity11 , to a life in hiding as a defendant in a high - profile court case			2
