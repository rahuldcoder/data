-- @entity3 secretary of state @entity4 will meet friday with @entity6 , the president of @entity7 who has overseen a series of political reforms in the @entity11 country over the past year , a senior @entity2 official said			1
@entity12 is in @entity13 to attend a regional conference after visiting a string of @entity11 countries in the past few days			0
she will meet @entity6 in @entity18 , a fast - growing @entity13 tourism hub next to the spectacular temples of @entity21			1
the announcement comes after president @entity23 said wednesday that the @entity3 was easing sanctions on @entity7 , allowing @entity3 companies to do business there -- a move that prompted concern from human rights advocates			1
the @entity3 government considers the meeting with @entity12 a reward for @entity7 's progress in undertaking reforms , the @entity2 official said			1
in the past year , authorities in @entity7 , which is also known as @entity7 , have released hundreds of political prisoners and allowed the party of pro-democracy leader @entity39 to participate in by - elections			1
they have also engaged in peace talks with ethnic rebel groups			0
for decades , @entity7 was ruled by a repressive military junta			0
but in recent years , the generals have relaxed their grip on power , permitting @entity6 's government to enact changes			1
@entity51 government have responded to the reforms by easing sanctions			0
@entity23 praised @entity6 , @entity39 and the nation for " significant progress along the path to democracy			0
" the loosening of sanctions , he said , " is a strong signal of our support for reform , and will provide immediate incentives for reformers and significant benefits to the people of @entity7			2
" however , @entity23 noted that the @entity3 " remains deeply concerned about the lack of transparency in @entity7 's investment environment and the military 's role in the economy			1
" as a result , the licenses that will allow @entity3 businesses to invest in @entity7 will not cover entities owned by the @entity7 armed forces and @entity78			2
the @entity79 will also have the authority to impose sanctions on " those who undermine the reform process , engage in human rights abuses , contribute to ethnic conflict , or participate in military trade with @entity87 , " @entity23 said			0
but despite those safeguards , the @entity23 administration is allowing @entity3 companies to do business with @entity7 's strategic oil and gas industry , which has been a key source of income for the regime , said @entity96 , the deputy director of @entity97 in @entity98			1
" we 're disappointed that the @entity3 government has included the oil and gas sector in @entity7 in the easing of the sanctions , " said @entity96 , who is based in @entity99 , @entity100			1
he drew particular attention to @entity106 , a state - owned company singled out by @entity39 as lacking in transparency			0
@entity39 's party , the @entity109 , said thursday that it hoped @entity3 companies would invest responsibly in @entity7 in light of these concerns			1
" there is no true transparency in the country , " said @entity112 , a spokesman for the @entity109			1
" how can we be sure that investment will be beneficial to our people ? " the signs of both reform and resistance to it were evident in @entity7 this week			0
@entity39 , the @entity121 laureate who endured years of house arrest under the junta , was sitting in parliament for her first legislative session since she was sworn in two months ago			0
at the same time , military leaders nominated @entity127 , a former general who is considered fiercely loyal to the former dictator @entity128 , to be the country 's next vice president			2
his likely promotion from chief minister of the region of @entity134 to the second highest post in the country has disappointed observers who hoped for a more reform - friendly candidate			0
these conflicting signals will provide the backdrop to @entity12 's meeting with @entity6 on friday			2
@entity96 said he hoped the secretary of state will raise the " long list " of outstanding human rights issues in @entity7 during the meeting , including the hundreds of political prisoners who remain behind bars and ongoing conflicts concerning ethnic minorities			2
" the government says they will resolve these issues but they have n't done it , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
