@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is afraid to tell her sons their father might never come home			1
" my heart ca n't handle it			1
i do n't want to hurt my children , " the @entity10 woman told @entity2 wednesday as she waited in @entity0 for evidence about what happened to her husband and the 238 others who were aboard @entity15			2
@entity3 says she can not bring herself to accept that her husband is dead , even after authorities announced there were no survivors			0
" i ca n't trust the @entity1 government			1
i ca n't work now because all i can think about is my husband and my children , " she told @entity2 's @entity21 in @entity0			1
" i do n't have strength			2
... my head is a mess			0
" @entity1 officials say they can tell you how @entity15 ended			1
it crashed into the @entity29 , they 'll say , citing complicated math as proof			1
they can tell you when it probably happened -- on march 8 , sometime between 8:11 and 9:15 a.m. ( 7:11 to 8:15 p.m. et march 7 ) , handing you a sheet with extraordinarily technical details about satellite communications technology			0
what they still ca n't tell you is why , or precisely where , or show you a piece of the wreckage			1
all those uncertainties are too much for @entity3 and other relatives of people aboard the plane			2
in @entity48 , outraged family members marched to the @entity1 embassy to denounce the airline , the country and just about everything involved with an investigation that has transfixed the world and vexed experts			1
@entity56 , whose mother was aboard the flight , told reporters he felt there was " no evidence " that the passenger jet crashed in the @entity29			1
" if you find something : ok , we accept , " he said			2
" but nothing -- just from the data , just from analysis			0
" where 's the proof ? @entity3 says the authorities ' answers to questions do n't make sense			1
" they have been hiding the truth , " she said			0
" even though they know the truth , they have been delaying it and missed out on the golden time for the search			2
" @entity81 says it is giving the families all the information it can and is sharing it as quickly as possible			0
and authorities say they know the news is hard to take			0
but tuesday , acting @entity1 transportation minister @entity86 defended the decision to release the analysis and the heartbreaking conclusions that flowed from it			1
" it was released out of a commitment to openness and respect for the relatives , two principles which have guided the investigation , " he said			0
that investigation now focuses on an area of the southern @entity29 off @entity100 's west coast , where authorities believe the plane went down after a long , odd , unexplained flight that should have ended hours before in @entity48			1
searching there resumed wednesday after bad weather grounded planes for a day			2
@entity86 said authorities have stopped searching for the plane altogether along a northern arc that stretched from @entity109 to @entity110			2
analysis of data by @entity114 satellite company @entity113 and @entity114 accident investigators show the @entity116 was heading south at last contact , he said			0
how ' groundbreaking ' number crunching found path of @entity15 commercial satellite data from a @entity122 company , first analyzed by @entity100 officials , as well as satellite data from @entity10 and @entity125 , have turned up evidence of debris bobbing in the general area where authorities believe the plane went down			1
@entity100 and @entity10 surveillance planes have both reported seeing debris on the water , but so far nothing has been recovered or definitively linked to the missing flight			0
authorities cautioned that despite the narrowing the search area , it could still be some time before crews find any sign of the airplane			1
" we 're not searching for a needle in a haystack , " @entity142 , vice chief of the @entity143 , told reporters			0
" we 're still trying to define where the haystack is			0
" search resumes after weather delay after bad weather halted the hunt for a day , searching resumed wednesday , the @entity152 said			1
a @entity10 plane took off for the search area in the @entity29 at 5 a.m. wednesday ( 5 p.m. et tuesday ) , several hours ahead of schedule , the authority said			1
@entity160 - force winds , large waves , heavy rain and low clouds lashed the search area tuesday , making it impossible to dispatch surveillance planes to the scene and making it all but impossible to spot anything from ships			1
" it 's a pretty remote area and weather conditions can get very , very bad , very , very quickly , " said @entity170 of the @entity171			1
" at the moment , we 're looking at a good day today , but we are expecting conditions to deteriorate again tomorrow			0
" wednesday 's search is set to include ships and aircraft from six countries : @entity100 , @entity181 , the @entity122 , @entity182 , @entity10 and @entity183			1
twelve aircraft will be part of the search , @entity100 officials said			1
@entity100 's @entity189 and @entity10 's @entity191 polar supply ship are also in the search area , officials said			1
@entity122 equipment to help find the plane 's locator beacon arrived in @entity196 on wednesday			1
but even with more searchers and equipment and calmer weather , the effort will still face severe challenges			1
the area is extraordinarily remote -- some 1,500 miles from @entity196 , where military surveillance planes capable of searching the site are based			1
it is also astoundingly large --- some 400,000 to 500,000 square miles of ocean			0
" with eight hours of flying to and from the search region , the fleet of p - 3 orion aircraft and other military aircraft have only a precious few hours to scour the search tracks they have been given , " @entity100 defence minister @entity207 said			2
to complicate matters , debris that may have been floating days ago , when some of the satellite images were taken , could have sunk by now			0
other debris may have drifted hundreds of miles			0
and time is running out to find the flight data recorder , whose locator beacon is expected to stop working sometime around april 7			1
more than half a million square kilometers ( 193,000 square miles ) have been searched to date , @entity100 authorities said			0
how they 're searching for debris crash conclusion explained @entity86 spent part of tuesday 's briefing explaining how investigators came to the conclusion that the plane must have gone into the southern @entity29			1
he said the analysis was based on sophisticated mathematics calculating how long it took signals from a transmitter on the plane to reach an orbiting @entity113 communications satellite			2
much like the horn from a passing car whose pitch rises as it approaches and then falls as it races away , engineers were able examine the satellite 's signal and determine it had to be moving south , he said			2
engineers checked their calculations against data from other @entity254 flights that day and found their technique was sound , he said			0
one mystery remains in the data : the plane 's transmitter and satellite tried to make one final connection at 8:19 a.m. " at this time this transmission is not understood and is subject to further ongoing work , " he said			1
the analysis shows that the plane did n't answer a ping from the satellite ground station at 9:15 a.m. ( 8:15 p.m. et ) , leading investigators to conclude the plane 's satellite transmitter stopped working sometime between 8:11 and 9:15 a.m. " this , " @entity86 said , " is consistent with the maximum endurance of the aircraft			1
" that partial ping could be a key detail that helps investigators unravel what happened , experts said tuesday			0
" i think it 's very significant , " @entity2 aviation analyst @entity280 said			0
" this is the last time we hear from the aircraft			0
you have to wonder what was going on that might have sparked ( it )			0
" @entity1 has convened an international working group to help further narrow the search area			1
it involves agencies with " expertise in satellite communications and aircraft performance , " he said			0
it will build on the existing analysis of satellite data in hopes of pinpointing a more exact location for the plane 's location			1
what happened to cause the plane to veer off course and presumably crash into the @entity29 hours after it was supposed to arrive in @entity48 remains unknown			1
authorities and analysts have speculated anything from mechanical failure to terrorism to pilot suicide could have played a role			0
police have interviewed scores of people , and the @entity318 is conducting its own inquiry into the disappearance , authorities say			0
anguished families react the @entity1 government 's announcement was met with anger by relatives , many of whom said it was premature to declare their loved ones dead before locating any wreckage or bodies			1
others accused @entity1 officials of lying or concealing facts			2
relatives first learned of the conclusion that the plane had crashed via a text message sent to their cell phones			0
@entity1 authorities followed up with briefings for families in @entity48 and @entity0 , @entity1			2
" they have told us all lives are lost , " a missing passenger 's relative briefed by the airline in @entity48 said monday			2
in @entity48 , hundreds of friends and family members of missing passengers marched to the @entity1 embassy to express their anger and frustration			2
uniformed police blocked journalists from joining the protesters as they approached the gates of the embassy			0
one woman in the crowd , overcome by stress and emotion , was carried to a nearby ambulance on a stretcher			0
@entity1 officials said they are doing all they can			2
prime minister @entity363 explained tuesday that he decided to make his official announcement monday because he did not want the government to be seen as hiding information on purpose from the families of the missing passengers			0
in an address to @entity370 in @entity0 , he said his statement was based on " the most conclusive information we have			0
" @entity81 said tuesday it has offered family members financial support of $ 5,000 for each passenger aboard the ill - fated flight and was preparing to make additional payments as the prolonged search continues			2
ceo @entity380 told reporters the airline shares in the families ' grief			0
" we all feel enormous sorrow and pain , " he said tuesday			0
" sorrow that all those who boarded @entity15 on saturday 8th march , will not see their families again			0
and that those families will now have to live on without those they love			0
" @entity29 search has many challenges clues lead to new theories @entity2 's @entity396 reported and wrote from @entity397 ; @entity2 's @entity21 and @entity398 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 ; @entity399 and @entity400 from @entity401 ; @entity402 , @entity403 , @entity404 , @entity405 and @entity406 contributed from @entity48 ; @entity407 contributed from @entity196 , @entity100 .			1
