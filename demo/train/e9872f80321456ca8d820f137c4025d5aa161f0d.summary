-- he might be counting the days until his departure from @entity3 , but @entity5 manager @entity4 continues to quietly polish his curriculum vitae for future employers			1
the latest bullet point on a coaching cv -- now in its 20th year -- was monday 's 1 - 0 @entity11 quarterfinal replay win over @entity5 's fierce rivals @entity12 , as @entity14 's cleverly executed volley set up a semifinal against @entity16 at @entity17			1
appointed @entity5 's " interim " manager following the dismissal of @entity20 in november with the club 's @entity22 title defense in tatters , @entity4 has had to work against a backdrop of toxic fan discontent and increasing speculation that @entity29 coach @entity28 will return to @entity3 at the end of this season			1
unhappy about club owner @entity33 's decision to appoint the @entity34 , who has previously managed @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , a number of fans have been extremely vocal in their dislike of @entity4			0
as well as abusive chanting , some fans have even come to @entity3 brandishing homemade banners -- " @entity44 ­ tez , we 're just not in ter im " and " @entity46 ­ tez , not wanted , never wanted			0
" trophy chase out of work for two years after his dismissal by @entity37 , @entity4 has ploughed on regardless as he rebuilds his career			0
the win over @entity12 ensures the 52 - year - old will lead a club out at @entity17 for the first time in his career			1
@entity4 won the @entity11 with @entity36 in 2006 , but the final was played in @entity56 while @entity17 was being redeveloped			2
@entity5 's vctory on monday ended @entity12 's hopes of winning the double -- securing both the @entity60 and the @entity11 , a trophy the @entity63 side have won a record 11 times			1
given @entity4 's notoriously testy relationship with @entity12 manager @entity67 , he could be forgiven for giving himself a quiet pat on the back for sending the @entity11 competition 's most successful side packing from @entity3			1
in the original tie at @entity12 's @entity74 ground , @entity5 had to come from two goals behind to secure a 2 - 2 draw			1
in the replay , @entity4 's deployment of @entity14 , @entity78 and @entity79 up front proved key -- as did @entity82 's superb one - handed save to deny @entity84 's header to keep @entity5 ahead in the game			1
" i am really pleased because the players were doing a great job , " @entity4 told @entity88 match broadcaster @entity86			0
" @entity12 are a very good team and we did really well			2
we have good balance between the defense and midfielders			0
physically you could see one or two challenges we could not cope but with the ball we were much better			0
" it was a fantastic goal by @entity14 but everyone 's performance was really pleasing			1
@entity82 made some good saves but at the end of the day we deserved to win			0
" inspiration from the heavens the win ensured @entity4 could still end up winning two trophies this season			2
the other is the second - tier @entity109 , into which @entity5 dropped after becoming the first @entity22 winner to be eliminated at the group stage the following season			1
the @entity112 now face @entity114 side @entity113 in the first leg of their quarterfinal on thursday as @entity4 seeks to add to his 2004 success with @entity35 when the competition was known as the @entity109			1
" i won trophies in three different countries , " @entity4 told the independent newspaper on saturday as he defended his @entity5 managerial tenure			2
" they ca n't say ' @entity4 does n't know what he is doing			0
' just see the cv			0
it 's not just inspiration from the heavens			0
" @entity67 was magnaminous enough to admit that @entity4 's @entity5 had given his own team plenty to think about tactically -- specifically january signing @entity14 , @entity78 and @entity79 , whose clever pass set up the winning goal			1
" we spoke about @entity14 , with the players ' experience of playing against him when he played for @entity136 , " said @entity67			2
" he scored that exact type of goal against us a while back ( for @entity136 ) and we were caught napping			0
" their counter attack caused a few problems , especially with their players like @entity79 and @entity78			0
fortunately we did not concede another goal but i could n't really see us scoring ourselves			0
" @entity67 and @entity12 are now left to concentrate on their pursuit of a 20th league title , which should be a shoo - in give their 15 - point advantage over second - placed @entity16 with just eight games to play , ahead of their derby clash on april 8			2
@entity5 are fourth in the @entity60 , two points head of @entity154 , in the race to qualify for next season 's @entity22 .			2
