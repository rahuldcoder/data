@entity0 -- when @entity2 was laid off last year as a health and safety technician on construction sites -- another victim of @entity7 's deep economic crisis -- he wanted to put his severance pay into a sound investment			1
an @entity11 friend entrepreneur living in @entity0 , @entity12 , had a little idea : earplugs			1
now , the pair who met while playing in very loud rock bands -- @entity2 on guitar and @entity19 on bass -- have a business that seems almost unheard of in @entity7			1
they sell earplugs at rock concerts , nightclubs , even rehearsal studios			2
" many people who are unemployed in @entity7 , " says @entity2 , referring to the six million without jobs , " do n't have anything to invest			1
" but he did , thanks to severance pay after 11 years on construction sites , following the bust of the real estate boom -- a big part of @entity7 's financial crisis			1
" you work for a private company and now you think broader , " he said , explaining that he risked 2,000 euros [ $ 2,600 ] -- a small portion of his severance pay -- as seed money for the earplug business			2
@entity12 did n't have any startup cash			1
but he seems to have marketing in his dna -- his family has a clothing store business in his native @entity48 -- and he 'd previously tried other ventures in @entity0 , including a tourism magazine , that flopped			2
complete coverage : @entity52 but this time , @entity12 says , " failure is not an option			2
i get frustrated with people who say ' ca n't			0
' i hate hearing people be negative			0
" both men complain they 've been exposed to loud music without hearing protection and sometimes have low - level ringing in their ears long after the concerts are done			1
their earplugs are called @entity62			0
they went on sale late last year at a few locales in @entity0 , gradually adding more sites			0
but this weekend they 're reporting a huge leap forward , with hundreds of sales daily at the big @entity71 music festival in @entity72			1
the earplugs are dispensed from vending machines			0
for two euros [ $ 2.60 ] , you get two yellow earplugs , made from a soft , foam - like thermoplastic polymer called @entity78			0
they come in a tiny clear plastic case that fits easily in your pocket			0
they brought five vending machines to the festival , and @entity12 wrote in an email on friday : " next year we should definitely take fifty machines and put them everywhere			2
" @entity88 , watch : @entity91 president on the country 's future in oil some of the buyers in @entity72 , @entity12 added , are concert photographers who must stay long hours exposed to the loud music			1
in @entity0 , @entity98 , a small nightclub just off @entity0 's @entity100 street , was one of the first places to sell @entity62			0
manager @entity103 said the earplug machine is a novelty -- for his club and many others in @entity7			2
most of his 15 - member staff already use them for protection , including himself			0
" i do n't want to go deaf , " @entity103 said			0
on a night that i visited in may , a band called @entity114 ( @entity115 ) was playing at top decibel			0
i quickly inserted a pair of @entity62 , which instantly damped dow the sound to a more palatable level , although even at lower volume , i would n't count myself as a fan of @entity115 's shock and screaming style			0
@entity124 , a radio sound technician , was right up front during the @entity128 show with his girlfriend , and told me during a break , outside , that he 's used @entity62 and likes the idea			0
" if you forget your own , you can buy them for two euros , " right in the club , he said			0

@entity140 says @entity7 has a law on general ambient noise that lists 65 decibels as the level where it becomes potentially annoying , and also separate legislation requiring corrective action when workplace noise , such as at a factory , exceeds 80 decibels			2
@entity140 says a rock concert can easily exceed 100 decibels and that earplugs , depending on their quality and how well they are placed in the ear , probably could reduce the sound by 20 decibels or more			2
@entity2 and @entity12 aim to expand quickly			1
they 've put advertising on their vending machines and even on the tiny earplug plastic case , along with marketing schemes using mobile phone codes to direct consumers to web sites to view more products			0
