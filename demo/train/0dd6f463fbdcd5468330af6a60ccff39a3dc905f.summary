@entity0 -- exports of @entity4 @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity6 could get more expensive in @entity7 if a tit - for - tat tariff war bubbles over between the world 's most populous country and the @entity11			1
on wednesday , @entity12 launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes into imports of @entity18 wine			1
the inquiry follows new @entity11 tariffs , only announced tuesday , of nearly 12 % on @entity7 - made solar panels that begin june 6			1
the @entity22 has accused @entity7 's state - subsidized panel makers of flooding @entity18 markets with unfairly cheap products			1
in a public statement , @entity7 's @entity26 said it had " received requests from domestic wine companies , accusing @entity18 wine companies of entering the @entity7 market by dumping products , receiving subsidies and other unfair measures			1
based on these requests , the @entity26 will initiate a serious investigation according to laws and regulations			0
" " this is what we call ' strategic play ' in game theory			0
it is an action which is intended to have benefits in negotiation , " says dr. @entity41 , professor of economics and finance at the @entity43 , or @entity43 , in @entity44			0
@entity7 is smart to pick on @entity18 's wine industry , adds @entity41 , because it is " not core to @entity18 's economy " yet " symbolic enough " that it will have an " immediate impact " on people 's hearts and minds			1
if a tariff war ensued , " it would be very damaging for @entity4 , " says @entity55 , managing director of @entity56 , one of @entity7 's biggest importers of foreign wine			1
@entity4 is @entity7 's number one exporter of wines			1
in 2012 , the country shipped more than 700,000 bottles to @entity7 , more than four times the volume of second - ranked @entity68 , according to the @entity69			1
yet @entity55 believes a tariff war -- if kept brief -- may actually help the bottom lines of @entity7 's foreign wine importers in the longer term			1
from 2002 to 2012 , @entity7 's total imports of foreign bottled wine rocketed nearly 15,000 % to more than 1.3 million bottles			1
but from 2011 to 2012 , growth trickled to an anemic 8 %			0
" there has been a lot of enthusiastic buying that needs to be depleted , " says @entity55			0
" there is excellent inventory to last a short trade war			0
i 'm not as alarmed as i think i should be			0
" while a quick tariff war might encourage @entity7 consumers to drink their imported wine stocks -- and replenish their supplies -- a longer tariff war would have a more ambiguous impact , with potential winners and losers both in @entity7 and around the world			2
" new world wines are waiting for this opportunity , " says @entity55			0
" @entity68 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 are well positioned			2
" both @entity96 and @entity100 recently implemented bilateral trade agreements with @entity7 that lowered duties on wine imports to zero percent , he adds			1
" i do n't think it 's a good thing for us , " says @entity104 , president of @entity105 , a well - known domestic @entity7 boutique label that aims to keep volumes at or below two million bottles each year			2
" yes , we are in competition with imported wine , but that imported wine helps educate consumers			0
if consumers are more highly educated then it 's better for us all			0
" @entity104 expects a tariff war would only lead to a short - term jump in sales and that big - name , high - volume @entity7 wine suppliers like @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 would benefit most			2
" if prices rise because of a tariff war , @entity7 's wine companies will have less reason to do better , " adds @entity104			1
" human beings are lazy			0
" looking ahead , early august is the deadline to a tariff resolution			2
in two months , the @entity11 tariff of 11.8 % on @entity7 solar panels will rise to an average of 47.6 %			1
if talks fail before then , the @entity11 will decide in december whether to impose duties on panels for a maximum of five years			2
" ideally it would be better for both sides to retreat from their current positions , " says @entity41 of @entity43			0
" i understand the @entity18 economy is not in good shape , so there is a lot of pressure from domestic lobbies for protection from other countries			2
" " in the end , both will yield some inches , " says @entity41			0
" there is no winner in a trade war			0
