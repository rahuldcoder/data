@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the scorching summer heat , @entity3 can be found patrolling a section of @entity0 , @entity1 , that she 's dubbed " @entity6			1
" " it 's basically a dumping ground for live and dead animals , " said @entity3			1
the corridor -- an area more than a mile wide where abused dogs are abandoned -- is located in northeast @entity0 near the @entity14 exit off @entity15 59 ( @entity16 )			1
" one of the saddest cases is when i come across one in a large green hefty [ trash ] bag , " said @entity3			1
" some of the dogs that we find in the bags ... [ have ] some serious wounds ... most likely from dog fighting			1
" @entity3 , 52 , started the nonprofit @entity25 , and for nearly two years , she and her team of volunteers have been rescuing dogs from this area and shedding light on the neglect of these animals			1
in @entity1 , it is a criminal offense to abandon dogs , according to assistant district attorney @entity35			1
as a result of @entity3 's efforts , @entity35 says her office has filed criminal cases against people who have dumped their dogs			1
" @entity3 not only brought the problem to our attention , but she takes it a step further -- she tries to find homes for animals that have been dumped , " said @entity35			1
separately , in november 2008 , @entity0 executed the largest dog fighting sting in the country to date , said @entity35			1
as a result , 60 people were convicted and 168 dogs were seized			2
@entity3 has been involved in animal welfare for years and first came in contact with the corridor as a volunteer for a rescue group in 2006			1
within a couple of months she rescued six dogs from the area			2
a return visit in august 2008 moved her to rally her community for help			0
on a tip from a friend , she went back to the area to search for a pregnant dog in need of rescue			0
she saw the place still teeming with emaciated and scared dogs fighting for food , shelter and their lives			2
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity77 " i took my 12 - year - old daughter with me , and we spent the afternoon driving this neighborhood , " said @entity3			1
" [ we ] both literally were in tears by the end of our journey			0
" soon after , those tears turned to action			0
@entity3 sent out a mass e-mail to fellow animal lovers begging for help			2
" [ @entity91 ] said ... ' we have an absolute atrocity going on day - in and day - out			0
and i 'm calling this place @entity6			0
there [ are ] animals scrounging around for food constantly			0
they 're running in ditches with broken legs , broken bodies , pregnant			0
people , come out and help			0
' " many heeded the call , and @entity3 and her " active army , " as she calls it , started waging war on the corridor			1
in addition to the district attorney 's office , @entity3 's efforts have gotten the ear of city council members , mayoral candidates and the police department , which set up cameras in the corridor to try to capture people dumping animals			1
the group also educates community members about anti-cruelty laws and spaying and neutering their pets			0
" we literally are in a crisis here in @entity0 , " said @entity3			1
" enough is enough in the corridor			0
things have got to change			0
" @entity3 and her group have set up 18 feeding stations throughout the area			1
volunteers fill the bowls of food and water at each station six days a week , laying out a total of 600 pounds of food a week			0
" we are keeping animals alive until we can get to some of them and bring them to safety , " said @entity3			1
@entity3 coordinates all of the rescues			2
some dogs come up to the volunteers and want to jump in their vehicles ; others are afraid , so @entity3 and two other designated volunteers trap them using snares and slip leads , among other means			1
while the corridor is safe for volunteers during the day , said @entity3 , the group 's protocol is to never be out there after dark , even though no one has ever been bitten or attacked by a dog , she said			1
once rescued , the dogs are taken to a vet to be treated before they are placed with a foster family or other rescue group			2
@entity3 often tries to place dogs before they are rescued			1
while in the field , volunteers photograph the dogs , and @entity3 e-mails the images to her group 's vast network , which includes rescue groups for specific types of dogs			1
" hopefully we 'll get someone to say , ' ok , i 'll take that golden retriever , ' " she said			0
" so we 're really working together as a community			0
" @entity25 covers the cost of food , a crate and vet bills for dogs that are fostered through them			0
dogs that are n't immediately placed with a family or other rescue group go into boarding facilities until @entity25 can find them a home			1
" volunteers and myself go visit these dogs on a weekly basis , so it gives them more social interaction , " said @entity3			2
" we bring treats , blankets , take them outside on walks and hug them a lot			0
" @entity3 relies heavily on private donations to keep the operation going			2
so far , the group has relocated more than 180 strays from the corridor			2
" the most proud moments are when we take a dog that is in horrible condition and we bring it back to life , " said @entity3			2
@entity25 not only saves lives but helps build families as well , like @entity214 and her adoptive dog , @entity216			0
@entity3 and her group rescued @entity216 from the corridor in 2009			1
" it 's truly a miracle , taking a dog like @entity216 , in that bad a condition off the streets , and then putting him in a loving home with someone like @entity214 , " said @entity3			2
" @entity216 brings a lot of joy in my life			0
he 's the sweetest dog , " said @entity230			0
for @entity3 , the war will never be won until animal abandonment is extinct			2
" animal rescue is what i will do for the rest of my life , " she said			0
" i 'll be ... trying to save an animal from my rocking chair			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity25 website at www.corridorrescue.org and see how to help			0
