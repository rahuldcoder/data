@entity0 -- it looks like @entity3 is n't laying low anymore			1
the senator from @entity5 and possible 2016 @entity7 presidential candidate followed up a friday swing through the first - in - the - nation primary state of @entity10 with some candid comments on sunday talk shows about the next race for the @entity14			1
and following a @entity14 report that declared the effects of climate change are upon us , @entity3 said in numerous interviews that he does n't believe that humans are causing global warming , and does n't think any action can reverse that course			2
the moves by @entity3 put him back in the 2016 spotlight , which he 's avoided for much of the past year			1
inside politics : @entity3 says he 's ready to be president " it 's a completely wide open @entity7 field			1
none of our fruit is ripe : to move from long shot to frontrunner , every potential @entity7 candidate has to grow , develop , or overcome a debility and @entity3 has as good a shot at doing that as anybody at this point , " says @entity36 , a veteran @entity7 strategist and @entity1 contributor who last year founded @entity38			1
another @entity7 strategist said @entity3 's political persona is still a work in progress			2
" building a presidential profile is n't a sprint , it 's a marathon			0
showing up in @entity10 will no doubt stoke public speculation , but @entity3 has spent his time in the @entity56 working hard on issues that matter to @entity5 , but they also matter to a majority of folks across the country , " said @entity7 strategist @entity48 , a @entity1 contributor who was a senior adviser and spokesman for the 2008 and 2012 @entity53 presidential campaigns			1
poll numbers slip early last year , @entity3 's name was near or at the top of public opinion polls of @entity7 for the party 's 2016 presidential nomination			1
but @entity3 's numbers slipped after his high - profile support for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the @entity56 last june			1
the measure , which stalled in the @entity14 , included an eventual pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants , which is strongly opposed by many conservatives			0
@entity3 's numbers in 2016 polls quickly faded , and have remained in the single digits in follow - up surveys			1
@entity3 stood in ninth place , at 6 % , in the most recent @entity1 / @entity81 , which was conducted just over a week ago			2
while many of the other potential @entity7 @entity14 hopefuls , such as sen. @entity91 of @entity92 , sen. @entity82 of @entity83 , former sen. @entity84 of @entity85 , @entity83 gov. @entity86 , and @entity88 gov. @entity87 , have made numerous trips to all or some of the early primary and caucus states such as @entity10 , @entity96 and @entity97 , over the past 18 months , @entity3 has not			1
( while he has n't visited @entity96 since 2012 , @entity3 is n't forgetting about the state votes first in the road to the @entity14			2
@entity3 recently decided to focus the resources of his @entity101 on three big @entity56 races this year			1
one is the crucial @entity56 battle in @entity96 , where @entity3 's backing conservative @entity104 , whose stock is on the rise			2
) the visit to the @entity10 was his first trip to any of those key states since the last presidential election , other than an appearance at an event for @entity96 gov. @entity114 soon after the 2012 election , which @entity3 indicated he agreed to attend months earlier as a favor to @entity114			2
@entity3 sounded like a presidential candidate as the headliner for the @entity120 's annual " @entity124 " dinner , held at the historic @entity122 hotel just outside of @entity123			2
he slammed @entity125 and in particular former secretary of state @entity127 , who 's seriously considering a @entity14 run and is considered the favorite for the @entity125 nomination should she launch a candidacy			0
" their ideas never worked in the 20th century , much less the 21st , and they 're threatening to nominate someone now who wants to take us to the past , to an era that is gone and is never coming back , " @entity3 told the audience			2
a good first impression a veteran @entity7 strategist in @entity10 who attended the party dinner said @entity3 connected with the crowd			2
" @entity3 made a powerful first impression with @entity10 @entity7 on friday , speaking passionately about his uniquely @entity149 story and with conviction about his optimistic vision for our country 's future , bringing an enthusiastic overflow crowd to their feet at night 's end in @entity160 , " said @entity145 , who was a top adviser to @entity53 in the @entity10 in his presidential campaigns			0
" while senator @entity91 and ( @entity165 ) governor ( @entity163 ) @entity162 , each impressive in their own right , are both perceived as having early advantages here , @entity10 's upcoming " first in the @entity161 " primary is the most wide open that we 've ever seen , with no heir apparent , " @entity145 said			0
the dinner was just one stop during a busy day for @entity3 in @entity10			0
earlier , he headlined a fundraiser for the state @entity7 , held private meetings with some influential @entity7 , and sat down for interviews with local media			0
" i want people to look at the @entity7 as the party that shows them the way to a new @entity149 century versus a @entity125 that shows us how this is the new normal and we just have to get used to it , that the cashier at @entity188 will always be a cashier , and all he or she can hope for is an increase in the minimum wage , " @entity3 said in an interview with the @entity179			1
another @entity10 - based @entity7 strategist said @entity3 's " taking all the necessary steps that someone would take if they were considering a presidential run			1
" @entity3 quickly followed his @entity10 swing with an appearance on @entity201 's " @entity200 , " where he said that he 's ready to be commander in chief			1
" but i think that 's true for multiple other people that would want to run			0
" dig at fellow senator ? in the interview , @entity3 appeared to take a shot at @entity91			1
@entity3 said if someone wants to be president , they should fully commit to just that , adding that candidates should n't try to hold their congressional seats while pursuing the @entity14			1
should he decide to launch a 2016 campaign , @entity3 said he wo n't run simultaneously for re-election for his @entity56 seat			1
poll : @entity219 , @entity91 at top of wide - open 2016 @entity7 race " i believe that if you want to be president of the @entity149 , you run for president , " he said			1
" you do n't run for president with some eject button in the cockpit that allows you to go on an exit ramp if it does n't work out			0
" @entity3 has noted that @entity5 law prohibits candidates from being on the ballot for two offices , a rule he described as " the right law			1
" but in @entity92 , allies of @entity91 have pushed a bill that would allow a federal candidate to simultaneously seek more than one office			0
climate change controversy in the same interview , @entity3 set down a marker on climate change			0
" i do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it , " @entity3 said			0
" i do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it , except it will destroy our economy , " he added			0
in the week since the @entity259 administration released a national climate change report that named @entity261 as the city most vulnerable to rising sea levels , @entity3 has been critical of the @entity14 push on global warming			1
" i think it 's an enormous stretch to say that every weather incident that we read about or the majority of them are attributable to human activity , " he told @entity1			0
among other things , president @entity259 has proposed new programs to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , which most scientists say are the major cause of global warming			1
" the president is , he 's not a meteorologist			0
here 's what the president needs to be focused on			0
he 's proposing a certain set of policies that he would have to admit if questioned will do nothing			0
if in fact these scientists are right and it 's greenhouse gas emissions that are changing our climate , none of the things he 's proposing would do anything to change that whatsoever , but it would have a devastating impact on our economy , " @entity3 told @entity1			0
@entity3 : no ' eject button ' if he runs for president while the latest polling indicates most @entity149 say that human activity is causing the earth to heat up , there 's a wide partisan gap , and such comments could benefit a candidate among conservatives , who dominate voting in the @entity7 presidential primaries and caucuses			2
building a resume and @entity7 strategists say @entity3 's resume building can only benefit him if he runs for higher office			0
" many voters believe president @entity259 's inexperience has hurt him			1
in their next president , they are going to be looking for maturity , " @entity36 said			0
" @entity3 has to prove that he 's mature enough to be president and he 's beginning to do that by rather fearlessly taking on some tough foreign policy and domestic issues , from @entity323 to global warming			2
" @entity3 : candidates should only run for one office at a time and @entity48 says that 's just what @entity3 's doing			2
rather than spending much of the past year traveling across the country , @entity3 's been on @entity331 , putting policy ahead of politics			1
" you ca n't just invent presidential buzz , at least not presidential buzz that lasts or translates into something real			0
you have to be involved in shaping the debate and fighting on the big issues that matter			0
@entity3 has done that , so he 's a part of the conversation , " @entity48 added			0
but with the midterm election campaigns in full swing , giving potential @entity7 2016ers plenty of opportunities to hit the trail in support of fellow @entity7 , @entity3 may soon be spending more time on the stump			1
next month , he joins other possible @entity7 @entity14 contenders at the annual @entity353 " @entity352 in @entity0 .			0

after spending much of the last year *dodging* 2016 talk , @entity3 *re-emerges*
