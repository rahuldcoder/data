-- recently a school principal in @entity2 suspended a student for three days after the 10 - year - old pointed his finger at another student in class and pretended to shoot			1
this kind of harsh sentencing is not new			0
in recent years , we 've heard of kids being suspended for pop - tarts chewed into " gun shapes , " or for firing an imaginary bow and arrow			1
in fact , school suspensions over things that could not possibly be guns have been going on for years			2
last year , a @entity22 , @entity21 , kindergarten student was suspended from school for allegedly threatening others and herself with a weapon -- her pink " @entity28 " bubble gun			1
even finger gun suspensions have come up before			1
in a suspiciously similar @entity32 case last year , an 8 - year - old was also suspended for playing cops and robbers and pretending his finger was a gun			1
no word yet on whether these kids are part of the same ring of " robbers " -- or " cops , " for that matter			0
the use of imaginary weapons is only escalating			0
last year , a 7 - year - old in @entity45 was suspended from school for throwing an imaginary grenade			1
this ups the imaginary - weapon ante : given that real explosives can arguably cause more harm and terror than firearms , should the punishment for an imaginary grenade be greater than that for an imaginary gun ? when a kid runs around the room pretending to fly a fighter jet , he or she probably should be expelled or sent to juvie hall , no ? after all , an imaginary fighter jet carries imaginary missiles and other fictional ordnance			1
indeed , the modern imaginary @entity68 fighter aircraft carries enough imaginary ordnance to lay waste to a small imaginary village			0
we are having fun here , but only to demonstrate what , logically , we are dealing with when students are caught in the net of " zero tolerance , " where the mandatory punishments are anything but imaginary			1
in our public schools , " zero tolerance " policies impose unwavering , pre-determined consequences for certain behavior , with little or no discretion given to school officials enforcing the policies			1
you ca n't blame school districts entirely -- the federal government bears some responsibility			2
in 1994 , the @entity92 , forced each state ( upon threat of losing federal funding ) to pass laws requiring local educational agencies to , among other things , impose a minimum year expulsion upon a student who brings a weapon to school			1
sound familiar ? it should			0
the policy is firmly rooted in the idea of mandatory minimum sentences for adult crimes			2
such mandatory minimums remove a judge 's discretion to impose any punishment lower than the statutory floor			1
mitigating information about the offense and offender becomes irrelevant , because the judge is powerless to impose a below - minimum sentence			0
last year , attorney general @entity118 urged reform of mandatory minimum sentencing , so that individuals accused of certain low - level federal drug crimes no longer face excessive mandatory minimum sentences			2
even the nation 's top prosecutor acknowledges that " mando mins " have " resulted in unduly harsh sentences and perceived or actual disparities that do not reflect our principles of @entity130			2
" in sum , for adult criminal defendants , the mandatory minimum approach to punishment may be too draconian			0
for schools and our children , " mando mins " are apparently just fine			0
especially when they are repackaged as " zero tolerance " policies			0
there is no question that students who bring actual weapons to class with evil plans should face harsh penalties like expulsion			0
but how did we get to @entity150 and fingers ? at this point , schools can not blame the @entity154 , because these items are simply not weapons under the applicable definition , 18 u.s.c. ยง 921 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) 18 u.s.c. ยง 921 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( 4 )			0
and while it 's true @entity2 law vaguely requires school boards to adopt " zero tolerance " policies , without a whole lot of guidance , it 's clear that schools have irrationally overreacted			1
exhibit a ? the @entity167 's " look - alike " weapon definition upon which this principal apparently based the suspension : " possessing , transmitting , or using any kind of firearm , knife , razor , club , chain or other look - alike or replica object or item which can be considered a weapon or used as a weapon			1
" first , a finger is not an " object or item " because it 's not separate from your body -- unless you cut it off in shop class			1
second , a finger can not be " considered a weapon " nor can it be " used as a weapon , " unless you 're @entity189			2
third , the policy is also pretty vague			0
due process will render a law void for vagueness if its terms are not clearly defined such that a person of ordinary intelligence can readily identify what it prohibits			0
after reading that policy , do you know for sure what you can and ca n't bring to school ? did you conclude after reading it that you could not bring your own finger ? the school district does n't burn a lot of calories considering the precarious constitutionality of these policies			2
this is because the school can just suspend first , and plan on parents and children not having the time or money to invest in litigation over their constitutional rights			0
school violence is indeed a real threat			1
on the other hand we must not let terror cause us to jettison common sense			1
a child 's punishment should fit his or her crime			0
kindergartners playing cops and robbers using their finger are not the same as disturbed teens with @entity233 's on a campus rampage			2
school officials here are exercising discretion without oversight , and their snap decisions on imaginary weapons are affecting real futures			2
even in instances where a school official is capable of common sense , these mandatory sentencing policies can strip away whatever discretion and mercy could have been applied in an individual case			1
mandatory sentencing is increasingly being reconsidered as more harmful than beneficial			0
if we 're rethinking it for our inmates , perhaps we should rethink it for the students -- " cops " and " robbers " alike			0

@entity259 : @entity2 boy , 10 , suspended for pretending finger was gun , " shooting " *classmate*
" zero tolerance " cases have come up more as schools mete out mandatory penalties
he says the " logic " becomes *ludicrous* . if you take your hand to school , it 's a weapon ?
@entity259 : violence is real , but so is loss of common sense
