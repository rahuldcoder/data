-- here 's a googley vision for the future : " we definitely hope one day you can walk out of the house with your phone in your hand -- and nothing else , " said @entity3 , the company 's product manager for @entity5			1
it aims to digitize everything in your pockets in coming years by collapsing all that paper , plastic and metal into one device : the smartphone			0
the idea of using the mobile phone as a credit card , driver 's license , transit pass , digital coupon collector , house key , hotel key , corporate id and more probably sounds pretty sci - fi - futurey			1
but it 's almost practical when you consider the history of the smartphone			2
since the @entity34 debuted in 2007 ( it 's considered by most tech analysts to be the first true smartphone , running apps and functioning as a pocket computer ) , technologists have been cramming ever more functionality into these @entity41 - like gadgets			1
our phones have replaced many other once - common tools , from gps devices ( remember those ? ) to handheld gaming consoles , point - and - shoot cameras , calendars , notebooks , newspapers and portable music players			1
now they 're conquering new territory , most notably the wallet			1
from there , who knows ? analysts expect phones to get so smart that they could delay your alarm clock if an airline delays your morning flight			2
@entity66 's new " humble personal assistant , " named @entity67 , is a step in that direction			0
and technologists are working on phone prototypes that could be built into clothing , could project their screens on your skin or , in the way - off future , would have flexible and stretchable screens			2
" mobile phones are definitely becoming a center of all of our lives , i think , " @entity3 said			0
" when you 're carrying around this small computer , you can do all kinds of things with it			0
" the phone - as - wallet trend started in @entity86 and @entity87 about five years ago , and it 's been talked about in the @entity88 for some time			1
but it only became a reality september 19 , when the @entity5 app went public for @entity93 smartphones on @entity95 's network			1
that 's a relatively small subset of people ( @entity98 would n't say how many ) , but the company says it 's just an early implementation of what 's to come			0
here 's how it works at checkout : instead of pulling out a credit card to pay for your purchase , you get out your phone			1
then you tap it on an @entity110 reader ( these are becoming more common in stores and are usually labeled " paypass " along with a little radio - wave icon ) to log the payment			0
you have to enter a pin for security			0
@entity5 currently works only with @entity118			2
@entity98 also has a prepaid card of its own that you can load up with money from a bank or credit card account			1
some reviewers say the service is clunky			0
" other forms of payment are easier and quicker , " said @entity126 , a senior editor at @entity127 , who tested @entity5 in @entity129			1
" i do n't think the @entity98 wallet or any of these digital wallets are going to replace your leather wallet , " he said			2
" i just do n't think it will happen			0
" the phone - wallet technology is promising and probably will be a significant part of the mobile future , but it has to get easier to use , said @entity140 , director of mobile device technology and trends at @entity143 , an analyst firm			1
" i think the phone as wallet is a good place to start , and one of the things that has to happen is it has to be easy ... and it has to be accepted all over , " he said			2
@entity98 says @entity5 will continue to develop			2
the company hopes that , at some point , this smartphone app will carry loyalty cards and digital coupons so someone could just tap their phone and , all at once , also get discounts from a grocery store loyalty program or spend a @entity160 deal they had in the queue			1
in the longer term , the company and others hope to jam the rest of the contents of your pockets -- identification cards , transit passes , keys and the like -- into your phone , too			1
the details are far from worked out , but a phone with an @entity110 chip could be used to unlock doors and to identify a person			0
( here 's one reason @entity5 is n't all that popular yet ; only a handful of smartphones in the @entity88 have such a chip in them , including the @entity93 and two @entity185 models , which do n't work with @entity5			1
) for a hotel key , a clerk could transfer a key permission to the guest 's phone upon check - in			1
then the phone would communicate with a door lock in the same way it would with a cashier : by passing identifying information back and forth and unlocking the door			0
lots of hardware and industry standards might need to be changed to make something like that happen			0
and there will probably be security issues as well			0
even more complicated would be the phone - based drivers ' license , since state governments would need to approve that			1
@entity98 said there would obviously also have to be some form of authentication technology employed so the digital license could n't be faked			2
that 's a long way out , @entity3 said			0
but the company thinks the digital wallet is a smart place to begin			0
" we 're really just getting started , " he said .			0

already - useful smartphones are conquering new territory , most notably the wallet
phones can replace your credit card , driver 's license , transit pass , keys , coupons and more
the @entity5 app went public september 19 for @entity93 smartphones
some say phone - wallet technology is promising but must become easier to use
