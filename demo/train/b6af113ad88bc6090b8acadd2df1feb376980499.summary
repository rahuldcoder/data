@entity0 was destined to be a football superstar and was already one of the @entity4 's most promising tight ends			1
but less than a year after signing a $ 40 million contract extension with the football powerhouse @entity6 , he was charged with first - degree murder			1
two hours after his arrest on june 26 , 2013 , the @entity6 dropped him from the team			0
@entity0 , then 23 , pleaded not guilty in the slaying of @entity11 and is being held in a @entity13 jail without bail			1
@entity0 has also been charged in the slayings of two other men , and some of his closest associates are facing serious charges in connection with the alleged crimes			1
friends and fans alike wonder : how could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be accused of murdering three people ? from ' golden boy ' to behind bars long before @entity0 made national headlines , he was a standout athlete in @entity29 , @entity30 , who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty			1
" i do n't think there was another family that was more familiar in @entity29 , " @entity34 , who covers high school sports for the @entity36 , told @entity37			0
the young @entity0 was the " golden boy , " playing football , basketball and running track , following in the footsteps of his uncle , older brother and father -- all well - known athletes in the community			1
@entity0 's father constantly pushed his son , requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends			1
" i saw a closeness with them that i 'd never seen before , " @entity34 said of the relationship between @entity0 and his father			1
but his father , the man who kept the 16 - year - old anchored , died from complications after a routine surgery			0
@entity0 left high school halfway through his senior year in january 2007 to join the @entity63 , and trouble seemed to follow			1
in just his first semester , a police report says @entity0 got into a fight at an off - campus restaurant , sucker - punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum			1
the following fall , there was a shooting near a local club			2
police reports link @entity0 and several other @entity63 football players to an argument in the parking lot			1
@entity0 was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police , and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel			1
at the time , @entity0 's mother told the @entity83 newspaper , " i know he was at the club , but he never saw any shooting			1
" the case remains open , and no one has been charged			0
@entity0 was also suspended at least once for marijuana , an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year			1
trying to put the alleged drug use behind him , @entity0 wrote a letter to the @entity6 ' director of personnel			2
" if you draft me as a member of the @entity6 , i will willfully submit to a bi-weekly drug test throughout my rookie season			0
... in addition , i will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test , " he wrote , according to the @entity99			0
before the draft , @entity0 was expected to be a first or second round pick			2
he was passed over until the fourth round , when the @entity6 selected him			0
by the end of the second season , he was a bona fide star , inking the five - year contract extension worth $ 40 million			2
one month before signing the deal , however , he was partying at a @entity115 club			0
that same night , two men from the club were found dead			0
did spilled drink lead to slaying ? investigators allege @entity0 shot and killed @entity121 and @entity122 on july 16 , 2012 , because one bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink			2
district attorney @entity126 described the scene in a @entity13 courtroom in may , saying @entity0 became " angered and increasingly agitated , particularly after mr. @entity121 smiled and did not apologize			2
" prosecutors : bump , spilled drink led to double homicide @entity0 's friend tried to calm him down , and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street , the prosecutor said			1
court documents identify that friend as @entity139 , who would go on to accuse @entity0 of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later			1
after leaving the second nightclub , @entity0 and the friend returned to their suv and pulled over on a nearby street where @entity0 removed a revolver from the engine block , @entity126 said			1
@entity0 began trailing @entity121 , @entity122 and three of their friends in his suv , authorities said			2
he then pulled up to the victims ' car at a red light and leaned out the driver 's side window with a loaded revolver , @entity126 told the court			0
@entity0 allegedly said , " @entity163 , what 's up now , " followed by a racial slur , and fired at least five rounds from a .38 - caliber revolver , @entity126 said			1
@entity121 , the driver , was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest			0
@entity122 was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including one to the head , @entity126 said			0
@entity0 was charged in the double homicide just last month , and he pleaded not guilty			1
investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating an entirely different case -- the slaying of @entity11			0
do tattoos provide clues ? the killing of @entity11 in the early hours of june 17 , 2013 , @entity11 was shot seven times			0
the semi-pro football player 's body was found by a jogger the next afternoon in an industrial park in @entity186 , @entity13			2
@entity11 , who was dating the sister of @entity0 's fiancee , had been partying with @entity0 just before his death , his friends told @entity37			1
@entity11 's mother : ' talking to my son in the ground ' prosecutors say @entity11 was last seen with @entity0 and @entity0 's two associates , @entity197 and @entity198 , around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver @entity200			1
surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an @entity200 heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. at the same time , chilling text messages from @entity11 's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with " @entity4 , " adding , " just so u know			0
" between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m. , workers nearby reported hearing gunshots			0
at 3:29 , a camera showed an @entity200 pulling into @entity0 's driveway , about a half a mile from the death scene			1
three people got out of the car , and @entity11 was not one of them			0
nine days later , @entity0 was arrested and charged with first - degree murder and other weapon - related charges			1
he has pleaded not guilty			2
investigators believe @entity0 's simmering anger over two incidents at a nightclub and his apartment led him to allegedly kill @entity11 two nights later , @entity37 has learned			1
one of the incidents involved @entity11 seeing guns and ammunition stored at @entity0 ' so - called flop house , his apartment in @entity231 , @entity13			2
the other thing that set off @entity0 was a conversation @entity11 had with two men at a club earlier that night , june 14 , 2013 , a source tells @entity37			2
the cumulative effect apparently reached a breaking point for reasons that most people would find inconsequential			0
the source would not say what that was , but compared it to something as insignificant as the spilled drink that allegedly led to the 2012 @entity115 double slaying			0
@entity11 's killing did not involve possible knowledge of that double slaying as investigators previously considered , the source added			0
in april , @entity197 and @entity198 were also charged in @entity11 's slaying			0
they , too , have pleaded not guilty			2
life in a jail cell today , @entity0 is behind bars in a 7 - by - 10 foot cell			1
sheriff @entity259 , who runs the jail where @entity0 is incarcerated , says he has talked to inmate no. 174954 at length			2
@entity0 , @entity259 says , spends his time reading the @entity263 and another book he suggested , " @entity265			2
" @entity0 taken from jail cell and moved briefly to hospital @entity259 has encouraged @entity0 to turn to his childhood anchor , his late father			2
the father - son relationship has come up in their conversations and could have played a role in his checkered past			0
" his dad clearly kept him grounded , " @entity259 said			0
" when you lose that person and there 's no one there to help you process it in a healthy way , at 16 you 're going to reach out to anybody that 's older than you to deal with it			0
" even behind bars , @entity0 has found trouble			1
he has been accused of getting into a physical altercation with another inmate and is facing charges of assault and threatening a guard 's life			1
that 's on top of three murder charges , the lawsuit claiming he shot his friend in the face and three civil suits from the families of his alleged victims , among other things			1
@entity6 added to wrongful death suit as for the @entity11 case , @entity0 's lawyers contend the circumstantial evidence is full of gaps			1
" there 's certainly a lot of what i would call smoke			0
there 's no doubt about it , " defense lawyer @entity312 said during a june 16 hearing			0
" but that 's not probable cause that he committed murder			2
and you ca n't just throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and say that 's good enough			0
" no murder weapon has been found , and while at one point it seemed likely that @entity197 would be a key witness against @entity0 , there are now serious questions about his credibility			1
and the text @entity11 sent to his sister ? the jury may never hear about it			0
" i expect the defense to say that this is hearsay , " legal analyst @entity335 said			0
@entity0 's lawyers and mother declined to be interviewed , but both predict he will be cleared			1
it 's a possibility that haunts @entity11 's loved ones			0
" that 's my biggest fear , " @entity342 , @entity11 's former coach and mentor , said			0
" all it takes is one juror			0
