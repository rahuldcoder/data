@entity0 may block access to popular internet messaging applications like @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 if telecommunication providers there do n't comply with rules and regulatory conditions , according to the country 's official news agency , @entity10			1
a statement from @entity0 's @entity13 released via @entity10 read , " @entity14 emphasizes that it will take appropriate action regarding these applications and services in the event of failure to meet those conditions			1
" the statement did not address how the applications in question -- which allow internet users to communicate with each other via text messages and voice calls -- were violating any rules , but it did highlight the need for service providers in the country to quickly " work with the developers of these applications to meet regulatory requirements			2
" sunday 's announcement came in response to local media reports last week claiming the @entity13 , the country 's telecommunications regulator , had asked @entity0 telecom companies to allow the government to monitor those applications and had given them until saturday to respond			1
despite repeated attempts , @entity42 was unable to reach the @entity13 or any of @entity0 's three mobile providers ( @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 ) for comment			1
sunday 's move was met with derision by many @entity0 social media users			1
" the sense that i get is weariness , " said @entity52 , one of @entity0 's most prominent bloggers , while describing the online reaction she 's encountered so far			2
" a shrugging shoulders -- as if it 's typical			0
" " i 'm not angry , just a little surprised that the @entity0 government has n't advanced beyond this type of tactic , " added @entity59 , who tweets as @entity60			1
" i thought that they were better able to do this without resorting to have to threaten banning applications			0
" still , @entity59 told @entity42 she 's not surprised by the timing of the announcement			0
" i believe a big part of the reason why this is happening ... is because lots of demonstrations that were organized in @entity0 were done through the use of @entity5 , " explained @entity59 , citing recent small - scale demonstrations calling for the release of political prisoners			1
in @entity0 , an absolute monarchy , protests are prohibited			1
sixty percent of the country 's population is under the age of 30 and internet usage there is soaring			0
" a lot of human rights activists that communicate in @entity0 do so using @entity5 , " added @entity59			1
" and women 's rights movement members are communicating using @entity5			2
" @entity59 said @entity0 activists felt safer communicating using applications like @entity5 and @entity3 , as they are encrypted			1
according to @entity93 , author of the book " after the @entity95 : the coming collapse of the @entity101 , " the @entity0 government has grown increasingly concerned about the rising tide of dissent being expressed by @entity0 online activists of late			1
@entity93 explained @entity0 authorities would be looking for a way to monitor these applications because they are " prime examples of modernizing technologies which can not be co-opted and controlled by national governments and their security apparatus			1
" " in the past we 've had these voice - to - voice networks being blocked , " said @entity93			0
" sometimes for economic reasons , trying to protect state telecommunications monopolies			0
and that 's certainly been an issue in the past -- the blocking of @entity3 in some of the @entity119 monarchies			2
but now i think it 's quite clear ... that it 's the social and political use of this media that 's most alarming			0
" for @entity59 , the move is a " waste of time			2
" " people will know it 's not safe and move to another application , " said @entity59			2
" the same thing happened with @entity132			0
" @entity0 authorities threatened to ban @entity132 service in the kingdom in 2010 , accusing the company of not complying with regulations			2
the @entity13 demanded the company install local servers so the service could be censored			0
an agreement was eventually reached but it is not known what steps were taken by the manufacturer of the @entity143 smartphone in order to do so			0
" people who are aware know that it 's not that big of a deal even if these applications are blocked , " explained @entity59			0
" the issue is if they ban the @entity151 or if they do n't provide internet sevices			0
as long as the @entity151 is available , there 's no way that they can end freedom of speech -- it 's gone beyond the point of no return			0

@entity0 communications regulation agency threatens to block apps like @entity3 , @entity5
@entity163 says the apps must comply with rules , but does n't say what rules they *'re* breaking
reports last week said telecoms were asked to let government monitor communications
a @entity0 blogger says the move may be because the apps are used to organize protests
