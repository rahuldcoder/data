-- @entity0 picked the brains of the @entity3 's crew members before they set off on the voyage			1
from the importance of the mission to a pint of @entity10 cider , skipper @entity5 tells @entity0 about her hopes and fears , how she plans to get through the voyage , and what she looks forward to most at the end of it			1
@entity0 : what did you want to be when you were young ? @entity5 : i wanted to engineer a way to spend as much time on or by the ocean as possible			1
@entity0 : what 's the one characteristic that has led you to where you are today ? @entity5 : thriving off the feeling of living just outside my comfort zone			1
@entity0 : who inspires you ? @entity5 : everybody ! @entity0 : what 's the most important lesson you 've learned about yourself from the @entity3 project ? @entity5 : put your energy into your beliefs , think outside the box and it will happen			1
@entity0 : what 's your biggest hope for the expedition ? @entity5 : to communicate to as many people as possible that our oceans are our umbilical cord to life , without healthy oceans we are not healthy , no matter where we are in the world we are directly connected to the ocean			1
@entity0 : at what point would you define the @entity3 a success ? @entity5 : the @entity3 is already a success , it has proven that we need to think about the way we consume , the way we manufacture products , how we need to think about a products end life before it is created			1
most importantly it has proven that no one is as smart as everyone ; the @entity3 is a success because she has created a platform for many incredible minds to collaborate and engage in conversations on how we can ensure we leave this world in a better condition than we found it for our future generations			0
at the moment this feels like a tough ambition , but an exciting one ! @entity0 : what are your favorite sea creatures ? @entity5 : @entity79 , as we know so little about them , but their increasing population is a direct indication of the health of our oceans			1
dolphins , as they are our true companions when sailing across oceans			0
seals , as they look so lazy and fat , but if you get on the wrong side of them they certainly show you who 's boss			0
@entity0 : when is the last time you personally used a plastic bottle ? @entity5 : i 'm not sure , but we still get guests aboard the @entity3 who leave plastic water bottles behind ! have you tried to spend just one week without consuming anything plastic ? i have , and it was impossible , i had to steal my flat mate 's toothpaste when i ran out ! @entity0 : what do you most value about nature ? @entity5 : the way she makes your life feel like such a speck in the grand scale of things , your little worries feel so insignificant , the way she can make us feel like a visitor , but has her welcoming arms wide open			1
if we listen and open up she naturally teaches us how to live a sustainable , healthy life			0
she is always boss , we can choose to respect that , and live our lives as a caretaker , or not , but in the end she will always be here			0
@entity0 : what 's the one creature comfort you 'll miss most when you 're at sea ? @entity5 : cycling my bike through the countryside			1
my buddies and a good pint of @entity10 cider ! @entity0 : name 3 books you will bring with you on the expedition			0
@entity5 : i will be researching my @entity138 dissertation on populations displaced because of human influenced climate change , so lots of journals			0
if anyone has anything on this topic please send it to me ! i 'll be taking @entity148 's latest book , which i am currently reading , but not finding the time to finish			0
i also might take a copy of @entity152 's " @entity151 "			0
@entity0 : if you had to choose a theme song for the expedition , what would it be ? @entity5 : " @entity158 " by @entity159 ( written just for the @entity3 )			2
@entity0 : what 's your favorite adventure film ? @entity5 : " the @entity162 "			2
@entity0 : what 's your green motto ? @entity5 : the more time you spend in the natural environment , the more you will naturally become a better caretaker of the planet			2
@entity0 : what 's the most important thing you 've done to prepare for life at sea ? @entity5 : lived in a city for a year , this is the longest time for over ten years that i have not been on an ocean adventure			2
as much as i love @entity176 i ca n't wait to get back to life on the ocean			0
@entity0 : what 's the main emotion you 're feeling right now days before the launch ? @entity5 : my brain is running a million miles an hour to try to dot every " i " and cross every " t " in the preparations for the passage			2
once we leave we ca n't pick up what we have forgotten , we just have to make do with what we have			0
@entity0 : what 's your biggest fear for the expedition ? @entity5 : i do n't have big fears in my mind at the moment , we have spent a long time meticulously preparing the boat with an incredible team of talent			1
i am a sailor , so i have a huge respect for the ocean , and understand the path to take to minimize risk , i am in my element at sea			0
@entity0 : what 's the first thing you 'll do when you reach @entity209 ? @entity5 : have a shower ! i 'll also enjoy the post-adventure feeling of mixed emotions ; having achieved an awesome adventure , but also leaving a tight knit @entity3 family life behind ! oh , and maybe party a little !			2
