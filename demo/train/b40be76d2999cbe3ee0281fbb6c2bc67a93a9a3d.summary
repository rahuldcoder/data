@entity0 and @entity1 have n't liked each other for years -- they just are n't bothering to hide it anymore			1
long time observers of the @entity7 - @entity6 relationship struggle to remember when the personal chemistry between the leaders of the two countries was so bad			1
even the @entity6 prime minister has compared their relationship to that of a bickering " old couple			1
" the latest example of their dysfunctional marriage emerged tuesday when a senior @entity0 administration official was quoted calling the @entity6 leader a " chickens * * t " who does n't match war talk with action			1
the unnamed official , speaking to @entity26 journalist @entity25 , was only saying in public what key @entity0 aides have been muttering privately for years			1
" you have a dysfunctional relationship between @entity1 and @entity0 , " said @entity30 , a former @entity7 @entity32 peace negotiator			1
a senior official with a prominent @entity39 policy organization in @entity40 said : " these guys do n't like each other , they do n't pretend to like each other			0
" @entity1 offered a pointed response to the @entity25 article , saying he 's " not prepared to make concessions that endanger our state			0
" the relationship is troubled on multiple fronts			0
@entity25 also reported that the @entity6 leader had " written off " the @entity51 , an insult to an administration that still has two years in office			1
and tensions flared last week when the @entity51 denied @entity6 defense minister @entity57 meetings with vice president @entity58 and secretary of state @entity59			2
the administration tried to contain the fallout from @entity25 's story on wednesday			0
@entity63 , a spokesperson for the @entity64 , said @entity0 and @entity1 have " forged an effective partnership , and consult closely and frequently			2
" still , irritants have long tested the alliance between @entity40 and the jewish state — over peace talks , wars in @entity71 and @entity72 , settlements and @entity6 military action in places like @entity76 and @entity77			2
but the dislike between @entity1 and @entity0 is particularly acute -- and personal			2
@entity25 lists a stunning string of insults he has heard officials fire off at @entity1 over the years , including " recalcitrant , myopic , reactionary , obtuse , blustering , pompous and ' @entity83			0
' " opinion : @entity7 - @entity6 quarrel does n't point to a divorce the @entity1 - @entity0 relationship has played out in a series of awkward photo - ops , anonymous quotes in @entity7 and @entity6 media and tense body language			1
@entity51 officials were apoplectic in 2011 when @entity1 lectured @entity0 in the @entity94 about the history of peace talks and warned him not to fall prey to " illusions			2
" the same year , @entity0 was caught on an open mic , telling then - @entity101 president @entity100 : " you 're fed up with him ? i have to deal with him every day			2
" the @entity51 , for all its official praise for the " unshakeable bonds " between the @entity7 and @entity6 , blames what it sees as @entity1 's intransigence over jewish settlement policy and his playing to a domestic political gallery for the collapse of @entity59 's peace drive with the @entity114			1
key officials fumed at @entity1 's open backing for @entity118 @entity117 during @entity0 's re-election campaign and over what they see as interference in @entity7 politics through his strong ties to hawks in @entity125			1
but the roots of the animosity lie deeper — in sharply differing perceptions of the threat posed by @entity130 — an issue coming to a head with a deadline looming for a deal between @entity135 and world powers next month			0
for @entity0 , the @entity130 nuclear challenge is another crisis to be managed , and a test case of his doctrine that the @entity7 should be prepared to talk to its enemies			1
but people familiar with @entity1 's worldview say he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the jewish state from an existential threat posed by @entity135 's nuclear ambitions			0
@entity6 worries that the agreement that emerges will leave @entity130 as a nuclear " threshold state " with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon			0
" i fervently hope that under your leadership that will not happen , " @entity1 told @entity0 in a @entity51 photo - op this month			0
the @entity0 administration says the kind of ' perfect ' deal envisioned by @entity6 , which would strip @entity130 of centrifuges and nuclear infrastructure is not realistic , and says its goal is to ensure that @entity135 does not have a nuclear bomb			1
the disagreement is likely to provoke a new political showdown over @entity130 in @entity125 , where a bipartisan coalition is mulling a number of steps including further sanctions which the @entity51 warns could scupper a deal and lead to war			0
while the relationship between @entity0 and @entity1 deteriorates , it does not so far appear to be harming the fundamental relationship between their two nations			2
that has not always been the case in the past			0
in 1981 , the @entity183 administration instructed @entity185 ambassador @entity184 to back a resolution criticizing @entity6 for an air attack on an @entity76 nuclear reactor			2
relations became so frayed between president @entity190 and the administration of @entity6 prime minister @entity192 that his secretary of state , @entity193 , told lawmakers that if @entity6 wanted to talk peace , it should call the @entity51 switchboard			2
personal relations may be fraught now with @entity1 , but @entity0 has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military @entity7 aid to @entity6 which amounts to $ 3 billion a year			1
indeed , the @entity0 administration asked @entity125 for hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for the @entity202 anti-missile system which shielded @entity6 from @entity204 rockets during the latest @entity72 war this summer			1
senior officials from both sides also say privately that the security relationship between the allies has never been better			0
@entity30 said that @entity0 's spats with @entity1 will cause hurt feelings			0
" but what do they amount to ? it is confined and contained to a soap opera - like exchange that never leads to anything of consequence , " he said			0
what this latest soap opera may amount to for the @entity51 is an unwelcome new political row with @entity125 over its @entity6 policy — just as it is gearing up for a fight over @entity130			0
" when the president discusses @entity6 and @entity130 , it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is @entity7 's friend and who he thinks is @entity7 's enemy , " house speaker @entity224 said wednesday			1
@entity51 spokesman @entity231 said it was a bit rich to get a lecture by @entity224 on " salty language			0
" he insisted that the remarks by the official about @entity1 did not represent the view of the administration but pledged to continue to air differences with @entity6 on " illegitimate " building			1
that will all but ensure another bitter spat with @entity1 soon .			0

the relationship between the @entity7 and @entity6 is hitting new lows
