-- the @entity3 government shares many of the @entity5 concerns about the continuing violence in @entity7 , but @entity8 is reluctant to embrace @entity10 's proposals to solve them because it is wary of its motives , experts say			1
" i was in @entity8 a little over a week ago talking to our people in the embassy , " former @entity5 ambassador to the @entity15 @entity14 told @entity0 tuesday in a telephone interview			1
" they characterized our positions as 95 % the same			0
" for example , he said , @entity8 has complied with many @entity5 demands on weapons sales			1
" they have not been giving them offensive weapons ; they 've cut way back on weapons supplies			0
and just recently they 've refused to supply contracted weapons			0
" he noted that @entity3 government officials were to meet with members of the @entity7 opposition in @entity8			1
@entity3 : @entity7 opposition leader in @entity8 for meeting with @entity37 and @entity3 officials have backed most of the international sanctions imposed on @entity40 , he said			1
" they are acutely aware that they do n't want to end up on the wrong side of this			0
" but @entity3 joined @entity44 in using its veto power to block a @entity47 resolution calling for @entity7 president @entity48 to step down , which elicited anger from @entity5 officials and others			1
the elephant in the region is @entity54			1
last year , @entity3 abstained from a @entity47 vote authorizing @entity57 's use of force to protect civilians in @entity54			1
the @entity3 saw the ouster of @entity54 leader @entity61 as having exceeded the mandate			1
" we can not allow a repeat of such scenarios in other countries , in @entity7 , for example , " @entity3 president @entity63 said monday at a meeting in @entity8 of @entity3 ambassadors and representatives of international organizations			1
" i believe that we must do everything possible to press the parties in this conflict into negotiating a peaceful political solution to all issues of dispute			0
we must do all we can to facilitate such a dialogue			0
of course this is a more complex and subtle undertaking than intervention using brute force from outside , but only this process can guarantee a lasting settlement and future stable development in the region , and in @entity7 's case , in the country itself			2
" in addition , the @entity3 have looked warily at the @entity5 - led invasion of @entity91 and plans to include their southeastern neighbors @entity93 and the @entity94 in @entity57 , he said			1
" the @entity3 have an almost mania that we are trying to control the world , to surround them with military means , and that there are elements , including the government , that are trying to , in effect , use the @entity103 to bring a bunch of satellites under @entity5 military control , " said @entity14			1
" i think they 're wrong about many of those things , but it 's genuinely held			0
" @entity8 's belief that the @entity5 is playing a zero - sum game against them " makes them hypercautious about cooperating , " he said			1
further complicating the issue is @entity8 's concern that extremist @entity117 could emerge as powers to be reckoned with in countries affected by the @entity103 , @entity14 said			1
" here again , i think they are misunderstanding and exaggerating , but the point is that their position is not primarily motivated by trying to protect @entity48 in @entity7			0
they do have interests there , but those interests are really subordinate to some of these other factors			0
" though @entity8 has moved to boost pressure on @entity48 , there are limits to how far it will go , he said			1
" will they vote at the @entity47 for military intervention from the outside ? no , they wo n't			0
and i hope they wo n't			0
i think that would be a disaster for everybody			0
the fact is nobody has a reliable solution to end this			0
the idea if only they would vote for us and @entity48 would give up and everything would be sweetness and light ? that 's looking for pie in the sky			0
" he described @entity7 's nearly 17 - month uprising as an internal revolt against a strong military power			0
" if there is overt , external intervention , it 's going to just make matters worse , " he said , adding that that there is no easy fix to the killings , which by some estimates have exceeded 14,000			0
" in the final analysis , if the country is determined to have a civil war , we can not prevent it and getting in the middle of it and killing even more people does n't really help things			0
" in @entity8 , @entity176 , the head of international and media relations at the @entity179 , said @entity3 's long - time policy of close cooperation , first with @entity181 and then with his son , is difficult to change , but doing so could prove beneficial to @entity63			1
@entity3 analyst : @entity3 would n't resist intervention in @entity7 " i think now is a good opportunity for @entity3 to perhaps start discussing easing @entity48 from power and maybe taking him in , actually giving him some kind of asylum , some kind of guarantees , " he said wednesday			1
" then , @entity3 would have more influence on what is going to happen in @entity7 afterwards			2
... the opportunity is there , but apparently @entity3 finds it very difficult to change the policy that it has had for so many years			2
" the @entity3 - born president of the @entity199 , @entity200 , told @entity206 's " @entity205 " on monday that @entity3 's halt to arms sales to @entity40 may have had nothing to do with international pressure			1
" the @entity48 regime has no money to pay for @entity3 weapons , " said @entity200 , whose organization describes itself as a non-partisan public policy institution established by former president @entity209			2
still , @entity63 is well aware of international sentiment about @entity48			0
" he does n't want to be the only guy who 's supporting this failing tyrant , " @entity200 said , adding that @entity3 officials have made clear that they would not use force on his behalf			1
" the @entity3 position , basically , is if @entity57 and the @entity5 want to interfere with @entity7 , @entity3 is not going to stop them , but @entity3 is not going to support it either , " he said			2
@entity200 described @entity5 secretary of state @entity223 's statement last week that @entity3 was " standing up " for the regime of @entity48 as " unhelpful			1
" she urged a " @entity227 " conference in @entity226 to " make it clear that @entity3 and @entity44 will pay a price " for that position			2
" @entity3 is clearly trying to meet the @entity5 halfway -- behind the scenes , " @entity200 said about @entity63			2
" the last thing you want to do is to put him publicly into the corner -- if you want his cooperation			0
i think , on secretary @entity223 's part , this megaphone diplomacy is primarily for domestic consumption			1
" he added , " and i almost have an impression -- so sorry to be cynical -- essentially the suggestion is that the @entity242 administration does not want to intervene in @entity7 , and wants to use @entity3 as an alibi			2
" " with respect , i do n't agree with @entity247 , " responded @entity244 , former @entity5 ambassador to @entity57 , in an interview tuesday with " @entity205			0
" he said the @entity3 would still block any kind of planned international military intervention in @entity7			2
" @entity3 's just trying to put itself in the driver 's seat to be a potential peacemaker between @entity48 and the opposition , " he said			1
@entity244 also disputed @entity200 ' suggestion that the @entity5 did not want to intervene in @entity7 and was blaming @entity8 for its lack of action			2
@entity257 regime change in @entity7 would require dense urban warfare and would likely prove far more difficult to accomplish than it did in @entity54 , he said			2
@entity244 said @entity63 may be in a unique position to avoid all that by persuading @entity48 to exit @entity7 and go into exile in a third country , " perhaps in a deal to be forgiven any possibility of imprisonment or being tried for war crimes			0
if president @entity63 wanted to be the one to make that happen , i think you 'd find a lot of countries supporting him , including , possibly , the @entity5 and the @entity275 countries themselves			0
" @entity276 , the managing director at @entity277 , where he focuses on @entity3 and @entity279 affairs , said the problem will not be resolved if it turns into a conflict of interests between the @entity5 and @entity3			2
" we really have to find a way to work together , and i think there 's enough overlap in the way the @entity3 look at it and we look at it for us to start and have a much more constructive , quiet dialogue that will take into account the interests of the @entity5 and @entity3 , " he told @entity0 tuesday in a telephone interview			1
" just as important , it will also put an end to the violence more quickly than a confrontational approach between the two countries			0
" @entity276 , who served as senior director for @entity3 on the @entity299 staff from 2004 - 2007 , said there are questions within the @entity3 elite as to whether @entity48 is viable as a leader over the long term			2
" they 're prepared to see him go , but the method and timing is important			0
they 're really like to see this as part of an internal process as opposed to something imposed from the outside			0
" @entity3 suspends new arms shipments to @entity7			1

@entity3 expert @entity14 sees *compliance* on arms sales , sanctions
*recollection* of @entity54 looms large to @entity8
@entity223 's " megaphone diplomacy " is *criticized* as " unhelpful "
