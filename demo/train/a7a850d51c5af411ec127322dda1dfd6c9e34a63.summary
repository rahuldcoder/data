it 's not easy being a female entrepreneur in a country where women need a male guardian 's permission to work , rent property or travel			1
yet in @entity9 , a small but determined number of women are overcoming these obstacles to build their own thriving businesses			1
@entity15 constraints in the conservative @entity16 have not stopped women from amassing substantial individual wealth			2
an estimated $ 11.9 billion is held by women primarily in bonds and bank accounts , according to asset managers @entity23			2
as it seeks to hedge against its overdependence on oil , there is increasing government recognition that women have a part to play in @entity9 's economic development			1
it has led to a moderate winding back of restrictions on women in the @entity16 smoothing the way for a new generation of young entrepreneurs , like @entity40			1
in 2007 , aged 19 , she started @entity42 ( pomegranate , in @entity44 ) , a media and publishing house in @entity47 , with @entity48 and @entity49			2
the company runs two ventures : a monthly city magazine with a circulation of 70,000 , called @entity47 , and a social network called @entity55 ( where are you , in @entity44 )			0
by 2010 , @entity42 was ranked as @entity9 's fastest growing start - up , with a growth rate of nearly 600 % , by the @entity60 , which produces rankings of private growth companies in emerging economies around the world			1
meet @entity66 's female powerbrokers in the short life of her business , @entity40 has experienced several legislative changes			1
last year , @entity70 signaled that women will have the right to run and vote in the 2015 local elections , and be appointed to the @entity74 , the most influential political body in the country			2
he has since allowed women to work in lingerie shops and enter sports stadiums			1
in may , @entity70 dismissed his ultraconservative adviser @entity80 after he publicly criticized reforms aimed at softening restrictions on women			1
@entity40 feels that she is benefiting from changing attitudes : " we get a lot of support from other business , the media and individuals in general , " she said			1
" @entity70 ( has ) opened many doors to women and he keeps on doing so against all the cultural pressure he faces			2
" @entity40 's staff is 80 % female , but she says that even managing older males , she has n't encountered any difficulties			1
" i never felt any resentment or problems with them , " she said			0
" mind you , i was very tough and strict			0
" it was not always as easy for previous generations			0
recent research on the experiences of women entrepreneurs in the kingdom reveals the novel measures @entity9 women have resorted to -- sometimes devious , sometimes desperate -- in order to pursue their goals as independent businesswomen			1
@entity114 doctoral candidate @entity113 , who grew up in @entity9 , conducted in - depth interviews with 13 female @entity9 entrepreneurs to explore the strategies they used to work around cultural restrictions on women in the @entity122 kingdom			1
through interviews with women working in professions like healthcare , fashion and pr over two decades , @entity113 found that , while @entity9 women were increasingly encouraged to enter the world of commerce , entrepreneurial activity was largely confined to women who were already independently wealthy			1
want more female execs ? sort out the household chores but wealthy women still face many obstacles , says @entity113			1
they must be able to afford childcare and drivers , have access to start - up capital through family connections as well as having the means to buy commercial property , which they are legally forbidden from renting			0
women registering a business that serves both sexes must employ a male manager , so many female entrepreneurs would nominate a father or brother even though , in reality , they continued to control the business , she said			0
this left them open to exploitation , according to @entity113			0
she recounts the story of a healthcare business owner she interviewed who had her permission to travel rescinded by her " jealous " husband			0
unwilling to divorce for fear of losing her children , the entrepreneur began paying her husband for his permission to travel , said @entity113			0
other women have been more confrontational in the face of obstacles : one entrepreneur , who had started a business in 1990 , lost her temper when confronted with a " @entity176 " sign in a government department , and ripped the sign off the door			1
she was helped by a sympathetic manager , but @entity113 observes , " sometimes it 's just you and your luck ; it 's who you meet on the day			0
that 's what the women are facing			2
" alkhaled notes that , although many of the entrepreneurs she had interviewed felt " empowered " by their business experience , and were motivated by a desire for gradual social change , they expressed respect for their society 's traditions			0
" they do n't want to challenge the religious side of it			0
they just want their right to live and work in society			0
they 're not looking to fight the conservatives on their views			0
the women also felt a patriotic pride in @entity9 , despite the obstacles they had encountered			1
" all the women said , ' if i had to pick up my business and put it anywhere else in the world tomorrow , i would flatly refuse , ' " @entity113 said			0
" @entity9 is quite a new country and they really want a hand in building it			2
" @entity40 says she is also patriotic			2
but adds , " one day we would like to expand our operation globally			0

although they ca n't yet drive , some @entity9 women have started *successful* *enterprises*
entrepreneurial activity is mainly confined to already wealthy women , says researcher
@entity9 's *leader* has been softening legislation , making it easier for women to work
young @entity9 businesswoman @entity40 feels more supported , she says
