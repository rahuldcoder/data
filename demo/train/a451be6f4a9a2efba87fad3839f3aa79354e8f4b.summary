a new court will consider whether the convicted murderer at the center of a wildly popular podcast should get a new trial , a @entity7 judge has ruled			1
' serial ' , a podcast spinoff of the radio program " @entity10 , " concluded its 12 - episode series in december that chronicled -- in methodic , cliff - hanging detail -- the case of @entity14 , the @entity15 high school student convicted in the slaying of ex-girlfriend @entity17			1
@entity18 and @entity14 were seniors at @entity20 in @entity21 when she disappeared in january 1999			1
her body was discovered in a city forest three weeks later			0
throughout the podcast , reporter @entity25 pointed to numerous inconsistencies made by @entity28 -- a fellow classmate and key witness -- in statements he made to police as well as his testimony			0
the prosecution centered largely on @entity28 ' testimony , which ultimately prevailed , according to @entity14 , thanks to missteps allegedly made by his lawyer at the time			2
" @entity14 argued that his trial attorney ... had screwed up in various ways , " @entity25 wrote on @entity41 's official blog following the ruling			1
" chiefly , he 'd argued that her failure to speak to @entity46 , a potential alibi witness , and ( the lawyer 's ) failure to seek a plea deal for him , even though he says he asked her to , amounted to what 's called ' ineffective assistance of counsel			0
' " @entity46 claimed in a january affidavit that she was with @entity14 in the library at the time of the slaying , but she says her attempts to relay this potentially exculpatory evidence to his lawyer fell on deaf ears			2
@entity46 filed an affidavit in january indicating that she 'd again be willing to testify , prompting @entity14 's new lawyers to petition the @entity62 , requesting that it release the case to a circuit court for a fresh look			1
despite opposition by the state attorney general 's office , chief judge @entity67 ruled in favor of the motion friday			0
@entity25 translated what the legal maneuvering means for fans			0
" in episode 10 of the podcast , i reported that ( @entity14 's appeal for a new trial ) was alive by a thread , " she wrote			1
" now , i 'd say it 's more of a ... well - made string , maybe			0
because it means that the @entity62 judges think the issues @entity14 raised in his brief are worth considering			2
that 's a pretty big hurdle for any appellant to clear			0
" but , she cautioned , " it 's bound to grind on for a long while yet			0
" arguments will be heard in june .			1

new arguments will be heard in the case of @entity14 , convicted of murdering ex-girlfriend @entity17
the 1999 murder and trial was the subject of the popular podcast ' @entity41 '
arguments will be heard in june
