-- @entity1 is the world 's first legally recognized cyborg			1
he has an antenna implanted into his skull that gives him access to something he was born without : the ability to perceive color			1
in a world where technology is overwhelming our mental focus and social lives , @entity1 , 32 , has a closer relationship with technology than even the most avid smartphone user			1
as a child growing up in a coastal town in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity1 was diagnosed with achromatopsia , complete color - blindness			1
in 2004 , he decided to find a way out of his black - and - white world , by developing a technology that would provide him with a sensory experience that no other human had ever experienced			1
the idea came while studying experimental music composition at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			0
for his final project , @entity1 and the computer scientist @entity36 developed the first incarnation of what they called the " eyeborg			1
" the apparatus was an antenna attached to a five - kilogram computer and a pair of headphones			2
the webcam at the end of the antenna translated each color into 360 different sound waves that @entity1 could listen to through headphones			1
although it sounds like a form of induced synaesthesia , a neurological condition that makes people see or even taste colors , @entity1 's new condition is different , and requires a completely new name : sonochromatopsia , an extra sense that connects colors with sound			1
unlike synaestehsia , which can vary wildly from person to person , sonochromatopsia makes each color correspond to a specific sound			1
it took about five weeks to get over the headaches from the sounds of each new color and about five months to be able to decipher each frequency as a particular color he could now hear as a sound			1
in the years after he began wearing the eyeborg , @entity1 went from complete color - blindness to the ability to decipher colors like red , green and blue			1
he could even detect colors like infrared and ultraviolet , which are outside of the spectrum of human vision			0
going to a supermarket became like a visit to a nightclub			0
his daily choice of clothes began to reflect the scale of music tones that matched his emotional state , the way that some people match a top and pants			0
when he was in a good mood , @entity1 would dress in a chord like c - major , colors whose sound frequencies correspond to pink , yellow and blue ; if he was in a sad mood , he would dress in turquoise , purple and orange , colors linked to b - minor			1
his concept of race also changed : he soon discovered that skin color , for him , was not actually black - and - white : " i thought black people were black , but they 're not			1
they 're very very dark orange and people who say they 're white are very very light orange , " @entity1 explains			1
the next step was to find a way to make the antenna less bulky			0
he began by reducing the weight of the computer to one kilo and strapping it inside his clothes			0
then the computer 's software was downsized into a chip installed under his skin			2
and this past december , @entity1 had the antenna installed directly into his skull			1
finding a doctor to do the operation was not easy			0
he presented his case to plastic surgeons , and then to over a dozen physicians			0
each one turned him down			0
he finally found one who agreed to do it if his identity remained confidential			0
it took months for the bone and the antenna to fuse , but @entity1 says he achieved exactly what he wanted			1
" i do n't feel any weight , i do n't feel any pressure , " he says , grasping the slender neck of the antenna			0
" it just feels like touching an extension of my body			0
it feels like a new body part like a nose or a finger			0
" @entity156 , of which @entity1 is one of the foremost pioneers , is a slowly growing trend			1
the development of @entity160 has brought more attention to the concept of wearing technology for extended periods of time			0
magnetic implants that allow individuals to feel the attraction of magnetic fields , like microwaves or power cord transformers , have become a popular piece of equipment among self - described " bio-hackers			2
" and more recently , a @entity176 filmmaker developed and implanted his own kind of @entity178 , a prosthetic eye embedded with a video camera			2
but @entity1 says he holds the distinction of being the first cyborg to be legally recognized by a government : the photo on his @entity186 passport shows him wearing his device , effectively sanctioning it as part of his face			1
he thinks the movement needs more momentum : " i thought that after a few years this would be really mainstream , that many people would start extending their senses , but it 's still not the case			2
" for that he blames societal pressure , pointing to an anti-cyborg organization called " stop the @entity199 " that specifically targets those who use wearable technology like @entity160 or the @entity202 , an automatic , wearable camera that captures your life			0
" people are afraid of the unknown			0
they tend to exaggerate or be very negative about the possible consequences of what is new to them			0
" for @entity1 , physically acclimating to the technology was the easy part			1
acceptance from others has been the real challenge			0
he frequently compares the obstacles he faces on a daily basis to what transsexuals and transvestites experienced half a century ago			0
in an effort to address some of these issues , @entity1 co-founded the @entity223 in 2010 with his childhood friend @entity224			2
he asserts he 's not doing anything unnatural : " hearing through bone conduction is something that dolphins do , an antenna is something that many insects have , and knowing where @entity232 is is something that sharks can also detect			2
these senses are very natural , they already exist but we can now apply them to humans			0
" one way in which the foundation is trying to show people what it 's like to be a cyborg is through the @entity178 app for @entity247 , which translates colors into the sound frequencies that @entity1 hears			1
he sees the app as a first step toward introducing people to the cyborg experience : " we all have a mobile phone and we all use technology constantly , so this has become normal			2
it will also become normal to have tech inside our bodies or have it implanted			2
i think it just needs time			0
" read more from @entity260 , @entity261 : stealing from nature : incredible new tech inspired by biology forget wearable tech , embeddable implants are already here this ' @entity269 ' - style molecular sensor fits in your hand , reads your food			2

@entity1 is the world 's first legally recognized cyborg
the 32 - year - old was born with an illness that makes him completely *colorblind*
he has a device implanted in his skull which translates color into sound
but not everyone is ready to accept the rise of the cyborg *...*
