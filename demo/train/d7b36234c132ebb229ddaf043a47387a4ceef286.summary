-- love regenerating alien time travelers who never leave home without a sonic screwdriver ? @entity6 fans of the @entity8 sci - fi show , " @entity11 , " are about to get a great @entity10 present			1
this year , for the first time ever , @entity12 is airing the " @entity11 " @entity10 special at 9 p.m. et on @entity15 -- the same day @entity12 airs the special in the @entity8			1
since 2005 , @entity6 fans of the franchise had to wait days , even weeks to see re-broadcasts of episodes and special events , first on @entity22 ( now @entity22 ) and now on @entity12			1
bloggers immediately assumed this unprecedented programming was an attempt to stamp out fan - related internet piracy			2
" we 're not waiting for it to air over here , we 're watching it online			0
we 're downloading it ahead of time			0
and not only that , we 're watching the unedited versions			0
it was n't until recently that ( @entity12 ) started to ... air them unedited for time , " said @entity35 , president of the " @entity11 " fan - club @entity36 of @entity37 , based in @entity38 , which has been around for 20 years			1
all that downloading " means ( @entity6 fans ) love the shows so much they ca n't wait to see them , " @entity41 , senior vice president of programming at @entity12 said			1
" and that 's the world we live in , in terms of technology , quite honestly			0
so let 's air these shows as quickly as we can post the @entity8 's transmission , " he said			2
and plans are in the works for season six of " @entity11 " to be broadcast the same day in the @entity6 as well , said @entity41			1
the @entity10 special has been an extra fix of the show which airs in the spring			1
by winter , fans have n't seen any new adventures for a few months			2
in the @entity8 , the @entity10 specials of the last few years have reached " event " proportions			1
whole families stay home on christmas day to watch the show			0
" the one with @entity73 and @entity74 in it i think was one of the highest viewed , non-sport television programs of the decade , " said @entity67 of @entity68 , and a " @entity71 " fan since age 7			0
this year 's @entity10 special , written by lead writer and executive producer , @entity80 , is called " @entity89 , " and features @entity81 as the 11th doctor , a grumpy , @entity84 - like @entity83 ( plays @entity85 in the " @entity87 " movies ) and opera singer @entity88			1
" i can honestly say i think it 's the ' @entity10 special that ' @entity11 ' has ever done , " said @entity90 , executive producer of the show along with @entity80			1
the audience for " @entity11 " in the @entity8 is much broader than the @entity6 audience			1
@entity90 points out that the show is actually quite popular with children in @entity8 , even airing at 7 p.m. there as opposed to a more adult 9 p.m. in the @entity6			1
while @entity99 and sci - fi fans in the @entity6 are generally aware of the show , which has a thriving cult following , it is still far from mainstream			1
but the show gets a friendly reception for being so " fringe			0
" @entity109 late night talk show host @entity107 -- who grew up watching " @entity11 " in @entity110 -- filmed an extravagant opening segment set to the " @entity11 " theme song , on the night that he interviewed @entity81			2
@entity109 did n't air the segment , but it went viral on the internet			2
" i spent time with the cast in @entity116 and @entity37 , " during a press tour for the show , @entity90 said			0
" and they were completely overwhelmed that people recognized them			0
they did n't expect that at all			0
i think @entity6 fans are every bit as passionate about our show as their @entity8 counterparts are			1
" @entity6 have known about this @entity8 import since the 1970s when episodes of " @entity11 " were aired on @entity129			1
the show is nearly 50 years old			0
it premiered in @entity8 in 1963 and ran until 1996 , with eight actors playing the title role			2
the show returned in 2005 with @entity135 as @entity11 and continued with @entity73 and now @entity81 , the 11th actor to play the doctor			2
many fans have a strong allegiance to a particular doctor			0
@entity140 , @entity11 from 1974 until 1981 , is often sited as a favorite -- well - loved for his quirky performance , @entity144 hairstyle and multi-colored scarf			2
@entity81 's doctor has also met with warm regard from fans			0
" my favorite doctor is @entity81 , " @entity90 said			0
" i think that he is just incredibly gifted and able to steer the action from a moment of real high drama and kind of vitriol to a moment of brilliant physical comedy and i think that 's why the show is in so many people 's hearts			0
" " i think i 'm not alone in saying he 's my favorite doctor			0

@entity6 fans of sci - fi shows like " @entity11 " do n't like to wait for re-broadcasts
@entity12 is trying to *decrease* *lag* between broadcasts in the @entity6 and @entity8
" @entity11 " @entity10 special is a *phenomenon* in the @entity8 ; popular in @entity6 too
