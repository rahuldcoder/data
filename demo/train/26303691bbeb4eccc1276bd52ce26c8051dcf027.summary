-- days after a senator and a police official raised security concerns , the @entity4 has reversed a @entity6 plan to screen visitors only after they arrived by ferry at two of @entity11 's landmarks -- @entity12 and @entity14 islands			1
in a letter written to mayor @entity16 , secretary of the interior @entity17 announced the change and requested that a security screening facility be built in @entity22 's @entity21 so visitors will be screened before embarking for the historic islands			1
@entity24 requested that the city immediately begin getting the permits to build a temporary security screening facility in @entity22 before the july 4th opening weekend for @entity28 , which is home to the @entity29			2
both islands were hard hit by @entity31 in october and have been closed since then			0
@entity12 will remain closed as it undergoes extensive repairs			0
a @entity6 spokesman said in a statement that the agency remains committed to implementing a plan that does not compromise the safety of their visitors			2
" safety will continue to be our number one priority as we re-establish a temporary screening facility at @entity21 , " said park service spokesman @entity40			2
" we are prepared to begin work immediately and appreciate the partnership with the @entity11 that we will need to allow for a reopening of the @entity29 on july 4			0
" recent park service changes -- with visitors to be allowed on ferries and on the islands before security scrutiny -- were challenged by sen. @entity54 , @entity55 - @entity11 , and @entity57 commissioner @entity56			1
criticizing the proposed security changes , @entity56 told reporters last week , " the @entity57 and the @entity6 have differences when it comes to ideas on how to protect visitors from a terrorist attack			1
" " it 's sort of ridiculous			2
it 's sort of saying we are going to screen people at airports after they get on the plane , " @entity54 told reporters last week			1
" they 've made a serious mistake here , and we are asking them to rethink it , to change it and simply go back to the old procedure			0
" in response to @entity24 's letter announcing the change , @entity54 thanked the @entity4 for its quick decision in time for the july holiday weekend			0
" this solution wisely avoids any trade - off between speed - of - opening and optimum security procedures , " said @entity54			0
" @entity29 is vital to maintaining our pre-eminence as the tourist capital of @entity86 , and with these procedures in place , it can continue to safely draw people from around the world			0
" since 9/11 , visitors have been screened at a lower @entity22 security checkpoint before boarding the daily ferries to the islands .			1

the @entity6 had planned to *relocate* screening to the islands
visitors would have been allowed on ferries and on the islands before security checks
senator : " it 's sort of saying we are going to screen people *...* after they get on the plane "
visitors will continue to be screened before boarding ferries
