-- a year ago , employees at @entity2 , a medical manufacturing company , wined and dined at the @entity4 overlooking the picturesque bay in @entity6 , @entity7 , for their annual retreat			2
the @entity9 is subtly scaling back amid a sagging economy			0
this year , employees are saying goodbye to luxury as company president @entity13 moved the event to a more sensible location : the @entity17			2
many of his employees who live near the hotel are expected to sleep at home			0
" it 's important to see we are making decisions for the good of the company , " @entity13 said			0
" at the end of the day , it 's going to be good for them			0
their jobs are still going to be there			0
" with a mentality like @entity13 's pervading the business and leisure traveler psyche , luxury hotels are bleeding occupancy and revenue at a rate far worse than the travel slump experienced after september 11 , travel experts say			1
to overcome their financial woes , luxury hotels are dropping rates , giving customers incentives and finding ways to cut operating costs without compromising the integrity of their posh images			1
@entity52 , which owns the chic @entity53 and @entity55 hotels , is offering existing and new members of its preferred guest program the opportunity to earn a free weekend night with two stays at any of @entity52 's hotels from may through july			1
guests can use their free night through the end of september across @entity52 's brands , including many of the company 's luxury properties			1
this summer , @entity66 , which operates five - star properties around the world , will offer customers who book particular packages free breakfast and a $ 100 resort credit			1
@entity74 's @entity73 is offering a " buy two nights , get a third night free " promotion for weekend stays through december			1
from december to february , occupancy in luxury hotels , a category that includes names such as the @entity81 and @entity82 sunk more than 15 percent -- a steeper drop than at mid-level hotels , according to leading hotel industry watcher @entity85 the revenue generated from the available luxury rooms fell 23 percent in that same three - month period , according to the @entity85 report			1
meanwhile , there are 551,610 rooms opening this year amid sluggish consumer demand , according to a @entity85 construction pipeline report in march			0
and when the economy rebounds , the luxury lodging segment will take longer to recover			2
" luxury hotels will lag behind the rest of the hotel industry , " said @entity96 , senior vice president of operations at @entity85 " they have ups and downs that are steeper than the industry as a whole			1
" @entity105 forecasts that the luxury hotel segment will stay in red ink until 2011			2
things have gotten so bad that some upscale - hotel owners across the country are delaying hotel construction to save money			0
other developers are facing foreclosure or have scrapped future hotel plans altogether , industry experts say			0
much of the luxury hotel business ' slowdown has been driven by guilt , some executives say			1
business leaders fear that they might look too excessive by staying at an upscale hotel as pink slips and pay freezes become ubiquitous			0
one high - end resort in @entity125 , @entity126 , had one of its business customers suggest that the hotel drop the word " island " from its address to downplay the resort 's exclusive image			2
many companies such as @entity52 and @entity136 are trying to lure customers by giving free nights and dining and spa credits without significantly lowering room rates , which could tarnish their exclusive appeal			1
hotel operators hope that offering guests free nights will encourage them to spend more money overall			1
other hotels prefer bundling their rates in packages so it is difficult to tell how much the prices have dropped			1
" they need to protect the image of their property , " explained @entity152 , a principle at @entity154 , a @entity155 , @entity156 - based company that works with luxury hotels			1
" they need to feel like even in this tough time , they are a prestigious place , so they are finding quiet ways to attract business and the right kind of business			2
" but other luxury hotels are dropping rates anyway , partnering frequently with online travel companies like @entity175 's @entity174 in special sales featuring five - star hotels			1
@entity178 , director of market management for @entity174 , says the discounts make it the " best time to upgrade " for travelers who have never lodged in luxury			2
hit particularly hard by the recession is @entity184 , @entity185 , where luxury hotel rates have plummeted more than 30 percent , according to @entity174			1
for example , the @entity187 , which is advertising with online travel companies for the first time , is touting prices of $ 89 a night at the opulent @entity192			0
the year - old luxury hotel sold rooms for about $ 200 before the economy crumbled			2
the company is also using @entity197 and @entity198 to appeal to a younger demographic , who can now afford to stay at their property			0
" you have a couple of bad apples in the bag , " @entity203 , vice president of sales and marketing at @entity205 , said of luxury hotels that began to dramatically drop prices last year			1
" then we all have to fall with it			0
" many luxury hotels , known for their extravagant pampering , amenities and services , are also making subtle cuts to save money			1
but they are careful not to scale back too much			0
@entity9 , owned by @entity221 , says a growing number of branches are replacing costly imported floral displays with arrangements from local vendors			0
some gift baskets now have fresh fruit and bottled water rather than smoked salmon , cheeses and chocolates			0
share prices at the company fell by 26 percent in 2008 while the company opened a record 430 hotels that year			2
at the @entity9 in @entity238 , @entity239 , the hotel has made valet parking optional to reduce the number of employees working in the front			0
instead , guests can park their cars			0
but cutting prices and services is a risky balancing act for luxury brands in the long run , warns @entity251 , a senior lecturer at the @entity252 at @entity253			2
" if you really are that much of a better property , consumers will start to wonder why your price is the same as a normal hotel , " @entity254 said			0
" but once consumers start to believe the lower price , luxury hotels may experience difficulty in raising prices when the economy recovers			1
it 's a double whammy			0

executives are *avoiding* meetings at fancy resorts to cut costs and appear frugal
