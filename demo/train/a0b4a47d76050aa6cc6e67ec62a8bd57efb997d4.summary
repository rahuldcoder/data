-- the @entity1 is the most powerful person on @entity3 , and one of the most threatened			0
this particular resident , @entity5 , was the target of an unprecedented number of death threats upon taking office -- three times as many as his predecessors , according to press reports			0
( i ca n't think of why that might be )			0
so you 'd think that , at a minimum , the house where he lives would be surrounded by a fence that was hard to climb over			1
but as @entity21 , the director of the @entity22 , noted in testimony today before the @entity24 , six people have successfully scaled the fence this year alone			1
the reason for the hearing was one particular fence jumper , an apparently disturbed man named @entity29			2
on september 19 , @entity29 not only scaled the fence , he ran across the lawn , through the @entity32 's front door ( which was unlocked ) , got past a @entity22 agent stationed at the door , went through the entry hall and into the @entity36 , and was finally apprehended near the door to the @entity38			1
we also learned this week details of an even more troubling incident in 2011 , in which a man in a car fired seven shots that hit the @entity32			1
it turned out that in the moments after , agents were told by a supervisor to stand down because the sounds they had heard were not in fact gunshots ; the damage from the bullets was n't discovered until four days later			0
security lapse : armed man was in elevator with @entity5 the @entity22 would say that thousands of times a year , agents successfully protect the president , other @entity61 officials , and foreign dignitaries , both in the @entity61 and around the world , which is perfectly true			1
but at a time when we spend billions of dollars every year on what has come to be known as " security theater " -- procedures and practices whose effect is less to make us safe than to give the appearance of security -- this is one thing you 'd think they 'd be able to get right			1
indeed , protecting the president is one of the few areas where the danger of overreaction is limited			0
the threats are real , and the task is specific			0
when it comes to the public at large , we 've overreacted plenty in the past , particularly since the september 11 attacks			0
we all take our shoes off in airports , show @entity87 to get into office buildings , and are generally treated as though we are constantly in imminent danger from terrorists -- when the truth is that there are few things less likely to kill you			0
and that 's not to mention the enormous apparatus of surveillance the government has built over that time , the details of which we still do n't fully understand			0
meanwhile , crime has been on a decades - long decline , while gun advocates tell everyone to buy more weaponry lest the barbarian horde attack their homes			0
in short , we fear the wrong things and overreact to threats that are real , but small			2
while the days when any citizen with a complaint could walk into the @entity32 and give the president a piece of his mind are long past , we still want our leaders to come out and shake our hands			1
we want to be able to tour the @entity119			0
the area within view of the @entity32 is the site for protests , speeches , and innumerable tourists taking photos , all of which we want to maintain			1
if we wanted , we could lock down the @entity32 -- eliminate tours for the public , put up 40 - foot steel and concrete barriers , maybe park some tanks on the lawn			1
during today 's hearing , rep. @entity134 , @entity135 , argued that anyone scaling the fence and running toward the @entity32 should be shot , which would mean a lot of bullets flying outward toward those tourists			1
this incident was certainly disturbing , and the congressional pressure the @entity22 is now receiving may lead to some salutary change			1
but just as we 're now questioning the tragedies large and small that come from police officers all over the country treating every citizen like a soldier in an enemy army , we should be careful about not going too far in turning the @entity32 into a fortress			1
we could make the building impenetrable , but but that would represent the loss of something valuable			0
by all means , the @entity22 should examine its procedures to make sure nothing like this happens again			2
they should put up a better fence			2
maybe keeping the front door of the @entity32 locked would n't be a bad idea			2
but this is a good time to remember that there 's a tension in any democracy between security and openness , and in @entity61 , of late -- the occasional screw - up notwithstanding -- too much openness is n't our problem .			2

@entity172 : @entity22 director faced *lawmakers* over @entity32 security *breaches*
he says we spend billions on " security theater , " you 'd think we could protect the @entity32
we overreact a lot since 9/11 , he says . rep. @entity134 says fence jumpers should be shot
security *vs.* openness : do we want fortress @entity32 , he asks ?
