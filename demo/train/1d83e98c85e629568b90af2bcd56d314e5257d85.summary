@entity0 -- even as @entity3 and @entity0 disagreed on the extent of the threat a damaged nuclear power plant poses , president @entity2 told the @entity8 prime minister thursday that the @entity9 will help @entity8 rebuild following last week 's devastating earthquake and tsunami			1
the two leaders had a 30 - minute phone call at 10:30 a.m. thursday ( 9:30 p.m. et wednesday )			0
during the phone call with prime minister @entity15 , @entity2 voiced sympathy for @entity8 's plight			1
" the president again conveyed his deep condolences at the tragic loss of life and the widespread suffering in northeastern @entity8 , " a @entity19 statement on the call said			2
" the president emphasized that the @entity9 is determined to do everything possible to support @entity8 in overcoming the effects of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck on march 11			1
" @entity15 also briefed the president on the status of @entity8 efforts to contain the nuclear emergency at the @entity34 plant in the country 's northeast , the @entity19 said			1
the developments came as the nations established significantly different radiation exposure warning zones			1
the @entity9 military will not allow troops to get within 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) of the damaged plant			2
the @entity8 government has told people to evacuate to at least 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) away from the damaged reactors			0
@entity8 chief cabinet secretary @entity46 said thursday it 's " understandable " that the @entity9 would make a " more conservative decision " on the warning zone as it tries to protect its own citizens			1
he suggests that is , in part , because the @entity9 is " not directly controlling " the situation			0
meanwhile , a @entity55 official said thursday that -- based on information gathered from a helicopter that flew over the @entity34 facility on wednesday -- authorities believe that there is water in a key fuel pool outside one of the plant 's most troubled reactors			0
hours earlier , @entity66 , the head of the @entity67 , told @entity68 that spent fuel rods in @entity70 of the plant had been exposed , resulting in the emission of " extremely high " levels of radiation			0
having water in the fuel pool is important because it helps absorb the radiation			0
the @entity34 complex lost its power friday , after a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake followed by a tsunami pounded northeastern @entity8 .			2
