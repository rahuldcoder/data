@entity0 -- the @entity3 is set to release its much - anticipated rulings on the constitutionality of the @entity6 , the comprehensive health care law enacted two years ago			1
the election - year rulings will not only guide how every @entity8 receives medical care but will also establish precedent - setting boundaries for how government regulation can affect a range of social areas			1
your health and your finances could be on the line			0
the outcome 's possibilities are myriad : a narrow or sweeping decision ? a road map to congressional authority in coming decades ? which bloc of justices , which legal argument will win the day ? here are five scenarios -- strategic markers of a sort -- to watch as the high court weighs in on health care			1
@entity32 ready for health care decisions -- then it gets tricky wait another day ? the first question the high court tackled in its seven - hour marathon argument in march was something few observers had expected : it boiled down to whether the law 's individual mandate is a " tax " that could prevent the court from considering the broader constitutional questions			1
a little - known federal law -- the @entity46 , dating back to 1867 -- bars claimants from asking for a refund on a tax until it has been paid			1
this " gateway " issue could render moot all the other pending health care questions if the justices think the minimum coverage requirement amounts to a tax			1
most justices seemed reluctant to take that route at the public argument session ; they appeared eager to move on and address the broader , more vital constitutional questions			2
but citing the @entity46 might give cautious justices a way out of deciding the explosive issue in an election year			1
the majority might conclude that the political branches can best resolve the conflicts , at least for now , or that the matter can be handled after the november elections			0
some court watchers have called this the health care " sleeper issue " that could delay a decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate for at least four years			2
health reform : what 's at stake for small business ' weak argument ' = certain loss ? baseball statisticians have nothing on the legal bar			2
after the arguments , wonky lawyers began counting the number of questions -- some hostile , some polite -- that the nine justices had tossed at opposing counsel			2
the somewhat squishy idea : the more questions a lawyer gets , the tougher it will be to prevail			1
during the two hours of debate over the most closely watched aspect -- the individual mandate -- solicitor general @entity100 fielded more than 100 questions from the bench			1
his opponents -- private attorneys @entity104 and @entity106 -- together faced only about 87			0
@entity100 , as the federal government 's key lawyer before the high court , was defending the law from a coalition of 26 states seeking its nullification			1
@entity100 , in the view of many court - watchers , had a bad day , struggling at times to find his voice and fend off a furious rhetorical assault by some skeptical members of the bench			1
chief justice @entity122 was especially tough -- he interrupted @entity100 23 times , but only on seven occasions on the other side			0
as a former government and private advocate before joining the bench , the 57 - year - old chief personally argued 39 cases at the high court and was widely regarded as among the best at making his case			1
in 2004 , while a federal appeals court judge , @entity122 wrote a law review article explaining why query counts matter			2
" the secret to successful advocacy is simply to get the [ @entity3 ] court to ask your opponent more questions , " he wrote			2
basics : health care reform issues divide and conquer -- 5 - 4 decisions but a perceived " weak " argument or a voluminous volley of questions does not necessarily spell doom for the @entity152 administration			1
getting nine intellectual hotshots with big egos to line up all the time along " expected " conservative - liberal lines is largely a myth			2
only eight of the 55 full opinions released by the court this term have been decided by a one - vote margin			2
of course , the most contentious cases are normally the last to be finished , and the number of 5 - 4 rulings is likely to rise with the 15 or so petitions remaining on the docket			1
but closely " divided " decisions are not the norm overall			0
some legal and political scholars hold out hope the court will offer a united 9 - 0 voice behind the law 's mandate , whatever the outcome , hoping such a decision would instill political and public confidence			1
they point to the 1954 @entity179 case , in which the justices -- despite internal disagreements -- came together to unanimously strike down racial segregation in public facilities			0
but this is a different court and health care in many ways is unique in the court 's jurisprudence -- the scale , scope , and political underpinnings all make it especially complex and contentious			1
the real people behind health care reform to " swing " again a recent " @entity197 " magazine cover featured an intense , distinguished - looking older man , wearing glasses and the slightest of smiles			1
most @entity8 would not recognize him if he walked down the grocery store aisle			1
but , as with most hot - button @entity3 cases , justice @entity203 -- the moderate - conservative often referred to as the " swing " justice -- could decide whether the individual mandate stands			2
so many are watching the native of @entity211 , @entity212 , who turns 76 next month , as well as another fellow conservative			0
" with the four more liberal justices almost certain to vote to uphold the individual mandate , the administration is really hoping for the votes of either the chief justice , who signaled that he had questions for both sides , or the traditional swing vote in the court , @entity203 , who really was tough on the government lawyer but toward the end suggested that maybe insurance was special enough that he could vote to uphold the mandate , " said @entity214 , @entity215 publisher			1
even the perception that his vote might be in play builds @entity203 's power from within , and makes him one to watch			1
for cancer patients , health act a lifeline @entity238 - @entity237 will the @entity3 think big when issuing its decision -- sweeping pronouncements on the scope of federal vs. state power when it comes to the @entity244 ? or will a narrow approach be the way the justices reach consensus , some sort of workable solution that would give @entity32 clear guidance going forward -- the discretion to perhaps reshape health care in a way that meets constitutional scrutiny			2
the key may be how the court 's shaky conservative majority defines a long - standing bedrock principle : judicial deference			1
some states have long complained that their autonomy is being eroded by creeping federal intervention on spending matters			0
@entity265 1 of the @entity266 gives @entity32 the power to " lay and collect ... taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the @entity8 " and to " regulate commerce ... among the several states			2
" such authority has long been broadly interpreted , including when imposing conditions on recipients , be they individuals or states			0
every student of government knows the @entity3 has the power to declare acts of @entity32 unconstitutional			0
the precedent - setting 1803 @entity284 decision remains a cornerstone of federal court authority , codifying the idea of separation of powers as an enduring hallmark of the @entity8 system of government			1
a health care ' @entity295 ' recounts his conversion that power has been used wisely -- judiciously , if you will -- over the years			0
the courts by their nature are reluctant to frustrate the will of the political branches , which are accountable directly to the people			0
it is a message president @entity152 himself offered just days after oral arguments in the health care cases were completed			0
" the point i was making is that the @entity3 is the final say on our @entity266 and our laws , and all of us have to respect it , but it 's precisely because of that extraordinary power that the court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature , our @entity32 , " said the former law school professor			2
" and so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this			0
" some conservatives interpreted those and remarks the day before as political interference in an independent branch of government			0
" the president crossed a dangerous line this week , and anyone who cares about liberty needs to call him out on it , " senate minority leader @entity327 , @entity328 , said			0
" the independence of the court must be defended			0
regardless of how the justices decide this case , they 're answerable , above all , to the @entity266 they swore to uphold			0
the fact that this president does not appear to feel similarly constrained to respect their independence does n't change that one bit			0
so respectfully , i would suggest the president back off			0
" the justices themselves are not prepared to back off when they issue their decision			0
nor are they likely as individuals to back into the political firestorm sure to follow			0
their ruling will speak for itself -- however big , small , or confusing it may be			0
after that , the justices will again retreat largely from public view , to begin a three - month recess			0
timeline of the health care law health care 's big four issues : what the justices are tackling			1

the election - year rulings will guide how @entity8 receive medical care
they will also set boundaries for how government regulation can affect a range of social areas
an 1867 law could play a *pivotal* role
the government 's key lawyer fielded more than 100 questions from the bench
