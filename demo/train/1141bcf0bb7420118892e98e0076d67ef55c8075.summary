@entity0 -- @entity3 officials debated how to dispose of more than 1,000 fragments that could have included human remains from the september 11 attack on the @entity7 before they ended up in a @entity9 landfill , according to newly released internal documents			1
the internal discussion about what to do with the " biological " material was released friday as part of an investigation into the workings of the mortuary at @entity18			2
in a 2002 e-mail discussion among @entity3 officials , one official identified in the redacted documents as a colonel suggests scattering the material at sea			1
" i do like the idea of spreading the ashes at sea in that it is a neutral arena ; it should represent an area readily agreeable to all parties , " the official wrote			0
a civilian official suggests that it might be appropriate to witness the scattering at sea and to have a chaplain present			0
another official , however , expressed concern that an at - sea disposal might " send a message to the next of kin that we are disposing human remains , and that is not the case			1
" that official asked that the powder and ashes be disposed of " immediately " and as " normal waste			2
" the colonel responded by saying that disposal would be based on that guidance , but reminded the official that the material was not " normal			2
" " my point , as you are aware of , is that @entity59 is not your normal set of medical waste , " the colonel said			1
the material is referred to in the documents as " @entity59 " and " special			0
" officials at the @entity7 explained that this group included material that was biological in nature , but it could not be determined that it was human or whether any terrorist remains were mixed in			1
" that was at the heart of the debate first because we did not know whether these were human remains to begin with , " said @entity68 , acting under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness			1
" we knew that they were biological , but they were mixed in with pieces from the building , from the airplane			0
" even something from someone 's lunch would show up as being biological in nature , according to @entity68 , who said that the internal debate went on throughout the @entity3 and reached into very senior positions			0
@entity88 has been engulfed in scandal since november , when it was discovered that some remains of deceased @entity92 troops were discarded in landfills until 2008 .			0
