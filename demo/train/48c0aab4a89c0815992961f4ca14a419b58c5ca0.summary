-- riding a bicycle around the city at night can be a perilous pastime with traditional bike lights providing a rather dim reminder of a cyclist 's presence on the roads			2
but a new prototype light system called @entity10 could soon make life in the cycle lane a good deal safer and leave bike enthusiasts beaming			1
the wheel - mounted led lights not only provide greater illumination of the rider 's path , say its @entity20 - based creators , but also make a bike far more visible from the front , back and the side			1
when stationary , as their promotional video shows , the lights flash in a simple sequence			2
but as soon as you start peddling they form a solid arc of white and red light			1
this dazzling effect is created with the aid of a magnet ( attached to the fork ) and an algorithm			0
together , they measure the wheel speed and tell the lights when and where to flash			0
the system is powered by a rechargeable lithium battery housed in the wheel hub			0
@entity10 ' founders -- inventor @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 -- are using the online fundraising platform @entity47 in a bid to turn their eye - catching patent pending prototype into a finished product			1
backers pledging $ 200 or more will receive the finalized design prior to its public release which is scheduled to take place in spring 2012 .			0

new @entity10 prototype makes cyclists more visible from front , rear and sides
led lights mounted on wheels create arc of white and red light
inventors aim to start selling the new light system in early 2012
