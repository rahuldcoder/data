would you rather have $ 1 to spend , or $ 1.49 billion ? for winners in three states , all it took was a dollar to cash in and reap the rewards of friday 's record - setting @entity7 jackpot			1
by picking the same winning numbers -- 2 , 4 , 23 , 38 , 46 with a @entity10 of 23 -- they earned an equal share of the $ 656 million jackpot , which amounts to about $ 218 million each , before taxes , under the annuity option			1
lottery players dished out a cumulative $ 1,491,082,267 since the game 's last big winner emerged in late january			1
except for a few smaller payouts , all that worked out to next to nothing			0
" @entity29 , why do you shun me ? " a @entity23 user mused on the social networking site , echoing the angst felt by many nationwide as it dawned on them that they were among the losers			0
" dear news updates on my phone , stop rubbing it in that i did n't win the mega millions ! ! ! " said another			0
in fact , nearly as many dollars were spent on tickets friday alone than ended up being given away			2
@entity38 , a spokeswoman for @entity40 state lottery that is currently overseeing @entity7 , said the day 's sales in the 42 states plus the @entity43 and the @entity44 , where the game is played , added up to $ 651,915,940			1
while lotteries are nothing new in the @entity47 and beyond , the frenzy leading up to friday night 's drawing -- much like the jackpot itself , which was the largest pool potentially for any single winner -- was unprecedented			1
people stood in long lines at convenience stores , dreaming of what they 'd buy , how they 'd quit their jobs and how their lives would change with the help of @entity60			0
it ended up being a boon to many state coffers -- who reap some of the money from lottery sales -- not to mention those selling the tickets			1
at @entity70 , a @entity72 convenience store , cashier @entity69 said that sales had tripled			2
" everybody wants to win the @entity7 , " @entity69 said before the drawing			2
many came convinced that they could beat the roughly 176 million - to - one jobs and take home the prize			2
they included a person who , around 7:15 p.m. friday night , came to a @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 , and paid $ 1 for a " quick pick " of one line of numbers -- which ended up exactly matching those pulled less than four hours later			1
it 's not know if the identity of that person will ever be known , as @entity84 lottery director @entity92 noted that the state does not require its jackpot recipients to do publicity , as some other states do			1
winners can also remain anonymous in @entity98 , that state 's lottery director @entity99 said			1
security officials know the precise location where the ticket was sold , but that information had n't been released -- even to @entity99			0
the state lottery has only said the winning ticket came from somewhere in northeastern @entity98			1
and the town of @entity108 , @entity109 , located about 35 miles south of @entity110 , was buzzing saturday with news that one of its own bought a ticket at a @entity114			1
" we 're having a great time , " the store manager , @entity115 , told @entity117 affiliate @entity116			0
" the people in town are having a good time trying to speculate who it is or hoping it 's still them			0
the atmosphere has just been sensational			0
" while no one has yet stepped forward to claim the prize , @entity99 had some advice for the winner or winners : sign the back of the ticket			2
put it someplace very safe			0
and talk to a lawyer before coming in for what will be a life - changing experience			0
while only three tickets hit the big jackpot , at least 42 matched five of six numbers -- 29 in @entity141 , 12 in @entity109 and one in @entity98 , according to lottery officials			1
@entity145 spokesman @entity144 said the payout on those tickets will be about $ 125,000 to $ 130,000			2
still , that 's practically petty cash compared to the rewards reaped by the three still anonymous jackpot winners			2
psychologist @entity152 said if any one of them is a poor money manager and has been unhappy in life before winning , that 's likely to continue			0
" it solves one problem , but it creates a half - billion others , " he said			0
" you have about no chance at winning this , but it really gets people excited			0

@entity7 tickets worth $ 651,915,940 were sold friday , a lottery spokeswoman says
that 's more than *1/3* the $ 1,491,082,270 in sales since the previous winner
the three big winners bought their tickets in @entity98 , @entity84 and @entity109
that assures them an equal share of the $ 656 million jackpot
