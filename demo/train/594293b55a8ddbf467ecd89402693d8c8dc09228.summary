-- one person has come to the @entity2 and come down with @entity3 here			1
authorities want to keep it that way			0
to that end , the @entity7 announced wednesday beefed - up measures at five of @entity2 's biggest , busiest airports aimed at preventing the deadly virus ' further spread			1
while talk about preventing @entity3 's spread abounds everywhere from coffee shops to tv news , this intervention wo n't affect a lot of people			1
it applies only to about 150 people a day , by @entity7 director dr. @entity23 's estimate , arriving in the @entity2 after having recently traveled from @entity26 - ravaged @entity25 nations of @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
these travelers will get special treatment , including having their temperature taken and answering questions about whether they 've been exposed to anyone with @entity3			0
the idea is to stop anyone with warning signs from getting past the airport gates , and into the @entity2 public , before they can possibly spread the virus any further			1
but , @entity23 cautioned , this is n't some sort of magic solution			0
@entity2 officials will likely discover some people have fevers or have had contacts with @entity3 sufferers , only to find out they do n't have the virus			2
someone can still unknowingly come to the @entity2 and show no signs of it , since it can take up to 21 days for someone to feel sick			2
plus , there are more ways than ever for people to cross communities , cross borders , cross oceans and spread a virus like @entity3			0
" we are stepping up protection for people , ( and ) we will continuously look at ways that we can increase the safety of @entity2 , " @entity23 told reporters			2
" ( but ) whatever we do ca n't get the risk to zero here in the interconnected world that we live in today			1
" can you catch @entity3 on a plane ? new policy in place of 5 of @entity2 's busiest airports some of the measures to halt @entity3 's spread are already happening -- in @entity25			1
the @entity2 government has been involved in efforts at international airports in the hardest - hit nations to question travelers about their health and exposure to @entity3 , as well as take their temperature using what @entity23 describes as @entity86 - approved devices			2
during those screenings , 74 people with fevers and three more with other symptoms were stopped from boarding planes , according to @entity23			0
none of those are thought to have @entity3 , something the @entity7 director attributed to the fact that high temperatures also are a symptom of malaria , a common ailment in @entity25 spread by mosquitoes , but not person - to - person			1
the @entity2 process for now will be in effect in only five airports -- where 94 % of all travelers from @entity25 enter the @entity2			1
it will start saturday at @entity109 's @entity108 , which has nearly half of all such passengers			1
the same thing will roll out next week at @entity113 outside the nation 's capital , @entity116 in northern @entity117 , @entity118 in @entity119 and @entity120			1
here 's how it will work			0
it starts with @entity2 authorities identifying anyone who 'd recently been in @entity25 , whether they flew in directly or via a connecting flight			1
@entity127 , deputy secretary of the @entity128 , explained that " we have in our screening capabilities the ability to identify individuals traveling not only with respect to the last point of departure but the point of origin			2
" " so ... we can , in fact , identify the full journey of the individual arriving in the @entity2 , " said @entity127			2
@entity141 -- the federal agency charged with safeguarding @entity2 borders and airports -- will take the lead , escorting pinpointed travelers to a what @entity127 called a " quarantine station			2
" there , they will be asked questions about their health and possible exposure to @entity3 , something that might tip off authorities that they might pose a risk			0
these @entity141 officers , who wo n't be wearing any masks , will also place a non-contact thermometer over travelers ' foreheads to take their temperature , since having a fever is one symptom of @entity3			2
if there are any red flags , the person will be evaluated by a @entity7 public health officer on site			2
he or she will then be given the ok to go , taken to a hospital or be referred to a local health department for monitoring and support			0
complete coverage on @entity3 all passengers who fly from @entity25 will be given information about how to monitor themselves for possible symptoms , will be asked to log their temperature daily and be asked to provide their contact information to authorities			0
debate if more travel restrictions necessary the only person to be diagnosed with @entity3 in the @entity2 , @entity181 , died wednesday in a @entity183 hospital			0
@entity181 traveled from @entity28 , via @entity184 , before arriving in @entity185 on september 20			0
it 's not likely the stepped - up screening would have affected him , according to @entity23 , because he did n't appear to show signs of the virus until a few days after his arrival			2
ebola patient dies in @entity185 there are many more like him , people who have spent time in @entity25 and been exposed , whether they know it or not , to the disease			0
@entity23 called the outbreak " unprecedented , " given how quickly its spread through the regions			0
according to the @entity201 , more than 800 people have been infected with @entity3 and at least 3,800 have died			0
authorities have said the actual numbers are probably much higher , because many people may have died before authorities firmly identified @entity3 as a cause , and others -- like @entity181 -- may have the disease without knowing it or reporting it to officials			0
and things are n't getting any better			0
according to a @entity201 update released wednesday , " the situation in @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 continues to deteriorate , with widespread and persistent transmission of ( @entity3 )			1
" this alarming trend -- and the fact that there 's been at least one person to bring @entity3 unknowingly into the @entity2 -- has spurred some calls to stop on all travel into the @entity2 from @entity25 so long as the virus is spreading			1
sen. @entity220 , a @entity222 @entity221 , has publicly urged secretary of state @entity223 to suspend @entity2 travel visas of those from the affected region for any " unnecessary travel " and not to issue new visas			0
the rev. @entity229 , a prominent civil rights leader who has served as a spokesman for @entity181 's family , argued that such measures will hurt the economies of longtime @entity2 allies such as @entity28			1
" we should quarantine the disease , not quarantine nations and not quarantine airline flights , " the civil rights leader said			0
" we should not panic			0
" @entity23 , the @entity7 director , also spoke against such a ban , arguing that severe travel restrictions will create more problems than they solve			1
" it makes it hard to get health workers in , because they ca n't get out , " he said			1
" if we make it harder to respond to the outbreak in @entity25 , it will spread not only in those three countries ( in @entity25 hit hardest by @entity3 ) but to other parts of @entity25 and ultimately increase the risk here " in the @entity2			1

new airport screening measures will affect travelers from @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29
they *'ll* take effect at @entity109 's @entity108 , then in @entity259 , @entity119 , @entity116 and @entity113
official : @entity2 can track those traveling from @entity25 via connecting flights
@entity7 director : " we ca n't get the risk to zero here in the interconnected world "
