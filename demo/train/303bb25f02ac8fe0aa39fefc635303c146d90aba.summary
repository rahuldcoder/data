@entity0 -- almost two - thirds of @entity5 's @entity4 political pros predict that former @entity7 gov. @entity6 will win the state 's caucuses on tuesday , but his campaign 's margin for error over @entity14 rep. @entity13 is slim			1
as the candidates dashed around the state making their closing arguments to a volatile caucus electorate , @entity1 surveyed 64 @entity5 @entity20 insiders -- including state legislators , local elected and party officials , senior advisers to @entity24 gov. @entity24 , business and conservative interest group leaders , veterans of previous caucus campaigns , and a variety of other party activists -- to assess the shape of the @entity20 race			1
in the @entity20 insiders survey , a solid majority of the 64 @entity4 political pros thought @entity6 would finish first over @entity13			1
who will finish first ? @entity6 : ...			1
.40 ( 63 % ) @entity13 : ...			1
.17 ( 27 % ) @entity37 : ...			0
.1 ( 1 % ) @entity38 : ...			0
.1 ( 1 % ) @entity39 : ...			0
.1 ( 1 % ) @entity40 : ...			0
.0 ( 0 % ) too close to call / dead heat : ...			0
.4 ( 6 % ) three other @entity5 @entity20 insiders thought the race was just too close to call between @entity6 and @entity13 , and they picked those two to finish in a dead heat			1
and another predicted a four - way traffic jam for first between @entity6 , @entity13 , former house speaker @entity38 and former @entity46 sen. @entity40			1
while @entity40 has been surging in the polls in the final week of campaigning , not a single @entity20 insider picked him to be the outright winner on caucus night			1
as one @entity5 @entity24 explained , @entity6 has run a shrewder campaign than he did in his 2008 caucus effort , when he bet huge amounts of time and resources in the state expecting a victory , only to see former @entity61 gov. @entity60 rally born - again and evangelical voters for the win			1
" he has run a smart campaign ; not the campaign that @entity5 politicos would necessarily like to see , but the operation has done the right thing in @entity5 from ( managing ) expectations to ads to finally deciding to play here , " one @entity20 insider , who asked that his name not be used , said of @entity6			1
" what is n't written about enough is the value of the time he put in @entity5 four years ago and how he still has staff and an extensive array of ' super volunteers ' around the state			0
he has had the money and now you are starting to see some enthusiasm at his events			0
he wins a close caucus			0
" indeed , when those same 64 @entity5 @entity20 insiders were asked to predict the percentage of the caucus vote that each of the @entity4 @entity92 hopefuls would capture , the race between @entity6 and @entity13 looked much tighter			1
percentage of caucus vote expected @entity6 : ...			1
.24 % @entity13 : ...			1
.22 % @entity40 : ...			0
.17 % @entity38 : ...			0
.15 % @entity39 : ...			0
.11 % @entity37 : ...			0
.7 % other : ...			0
.2 % @entity94 : ...			0
.1 % @entity6 is not without his challenges in the state			2
some wonder whether his @entity99 faith remains a barrier for him in a contest where 60 % of participants in the 2008 @entity20 caucuses were born - again or evangelical @entity104			1
but @entity6 's biggest challenge may be the feeling that he is too politically expedient			2
related : some @entity5 @entity4 want more options related : will @entity5 's evangelicals pick the @entity20 nominee ? asked what @entity6 's biggest hurdle in the state was , nearly two - thirds of the @entity5 @entity20 insiders said that it was the perception that he tailored his positions depending on the politics of the moment -- far surpassing concerns over the health care reform measure he signed into law in @entity7 or skepticism from born - again and evangelical voters			1
what do you think has been the biggest obstacle for @entity6 in @entity5 ? perception that he has changed views for political gain : ...			1
.64 % @entity7 health care law : ...			0
.22 % doubts about him among born - again / evangelical voters : ...			2
.14 % " as a supporter ( of another campaign ) in 2008 , i remember the attacks we tossed his way four years ago , " said one @entity20 @entity5 insider			2
" the flip - flopper image remains			2
" but that liability may pale compared to handicaps @entity38 has faced in the state			0
once the front - runner in @entity5 , @entity143 has had to endure a barrage of negative attacks , particularly from super-pacs supporting @entity6 and @entity14 gov. @entity39			1
and while @entity143 burst to the top of the pack in @entity5 after the collapse of @entity153 's campaign last fall , @entity20 insiders do n't think he built the kind of political apparatus in the state that could buttress him as he 's come under unrelenting fire			1
what do you think has been the biggest obstacle for @entity143 in @entity5 ? the negative ads run against him : ...			0
.61 % his lack of organization in the state : ...			0
.33 % doubts about him among born - again / evangelical voters : ...			2
.5 % personal baggage ( volunteered ) : ...			0
.2 % " while his lack of organization is a major issue , he could have conceivably overcome it if his face had n't been ripped off by negative ads , which are running almost every other commercial , " observed one @entity20 @entity5 insider			2
but another averred , " they have shown his record , which has been all over the map			0
" @entity6 's main rival in the caucuses , @entity13 , also has problems making more headway in the state			1
while the 76 - year - old congressman has been able to cultivate a devoted following with a blend of libertarian and isolationist appeals , there 's a sense among many @entity20 insiders that that kind of exotic brew ultimately makes him unacceptable to most @entity4 in a primary and most general election voters in the fall			1
what do you think has been the biggest obstacle for @entity13 in @entity5 ? his stance on foreign policy : ...			2
.56 % perception that he ca n't win in the general election : ...			2
.46 % doubts about him among born - again / evangelical voters : ...			2
.0 % " his ideas are too extreme and he does n't try to mainstream them , " said another @entity20 insider			2
" @entity13 's supporters do n't care that he ca n't win , " cracked another			1
" his foreign policy stances ensure that he wo n't			0
" whoever wins on tuesday , @entity5 @entity4 believe the party rank and file , along with larger - than - normal numbers of independents attracted by @entity13 's candidacy , will flock to the caucuses			1
half of the @entity20 insiders expect their turnout will be above the 119,000 mark set in the 2008 caucuses			1
while some of that may be wishful partisan thinking , only 11 % think that turnout will drop , while 39 % predict it will be about the same as four years ago			0
the @entity230 insiders were surveyed from the evening of december 27 through the morning of december 30			2
most of the survey was conducted over the @entity233 ; some interviews were conducted by phone			0
the @entity5 insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers in order to encourage candid responses			0
and while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns , more than two - thirds said they had not endorsed and were not working for any candidate in the race			1
here are the names of the participants in the survey : @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 .			0
