-- she was the world 's crusader against the trafficking of girls for sex in @entity6 , and she told an extraordinary personal tale : she was a village girl sold by a grandfatherly man into sex slavery			1
triumphant as well as beautiful , @entity11 won attention from @entity14 , a @entity15 columnist , a @entity17 documentary , @entity19 's @entity18 , and even @entity0 , which named her a " hero " in 2007			1
the fame -- and her memoir " @entity23 " -- generated millions of dollars for her @entity24 , fighting sex traffickers			0
but her personal story was n't true , according to a @entity28 expos√© this month			1
in the wake of the magazine 's revelations , @entity11 resigned this week from her foundation , which had hired a law firm to independently investigate @entity11 's background when questions arose			1
the law firm 's findings were n't disclosed by the foundation			0
@entity11 , whose book says she was born around 1970 or 1971 , could n't be reached for comment , but the foundation still bearing her name issued a statement this week : " as a result of ( the law firm 's ) efforts , we have accepted @entity11 's resignation effective immediately , " foundation executive director @entity44 said			1
" despite the foundation 's heartfelt disappointment , we remain grateful to @entity11 's work over the past two decades and for helping to build a foundation that has served thousands of women and girls			1
" the foundation 's commitment to eradicating the trafficking and sexual exploitation of women and girls in @entity63 remains steadfast , and we ask that you continue to stand with us in the face of these challenging times , " @entity44 said			2
villagers contradict her a @entity28 story by @entity69 cited how @entity11 's childhood acquaintances , village leaders and even a cousin contradicted her autobiography			1
residents of the @entity76 village told the magazine they never saw or met the cruel " @entity78 " who turned her into a domestic slave as a child , a rich @entity84 merchant who raped her , or a violent soldier whom @entity11 said she was forced to marry as a teenager			2
@entity11 claimed all those experiences in her story of survival			2
in fact , @entity11 arrived with a family and lived a normal life in the village from 1981 until 1987 , when she finished high school and then took a teachers exam , according to a commune chief , childhood friends , a cousin and a school official interviewed by @entity28			1
furthermore , " @entity11 was well - known and popular in their small village , a happy , pretty girl with pigtails , " @entity28 reported			1
those villagers ' accounts differed from the horrific personal narrative that @entity11 told the media and readers of her memoir			1
in an interview with @entity0 on friday , @entity69 said he spoke with " to dozens of villagers , former teachers , commune chiefs , who all say that they witnessed @entity11 arrive in the village			2
" " they say that they saw her arrive in the village with a family , she grew up in the village living a relatively normal life , " said @entity69 , who 's a contributor to @entity28			2
millions in donations @entity11 's foundation attracted such corporate partners as @entity127 and @entity128			2
actress @entity129 sits on the group 's advisory board			0
by 2011 , the @entity24 attracted $ 2.1 million in revenue and incurred $ 3.67 million in expenses , according to its annual report			0
in 2012 , those revenues rose to $ 2.78 million and the foundation 's expenses fell to $ 2.3 million , its annual report said			0
that year , the foundation helped thousands of sex workers : 9,269 in @entity6 , 1,356 in @entity141 and 6,675 in @entity142 , the report said			2
many people in @entity6 long doubted @entity145 's personal story , but they feared her duality : @entity11 was polished and charming in front of international donors , but was " tyrannical " and " moody " in the office , even ordering the girls in her foundation to do her personal chores , the magazine reported , quoting named and unnamed sources			1
false claims by " rescued " girls some of the girls and young women whom @entity11 rescued from slavery were used in testimonials promoting @entity11 's foundation , but at least one of those girls later " confessed that her story was fabricated and carefully rehearsed for the cameras under @entity11 's instruction , " @entity28 reported			1
@entity170 portrayed herself on a @entity173 television program in 1998 as a teenager who had been sold to a brothel and was forced to become a sex slave , but last year , @entity170 said the foundation chose her to go on television after auditioning her , the magazine said			0
in fact , @entity170 was never a sex slave			0
her parents could n't care for their seven children so they sent @entity170 and her sister in 1997 to a refuge center of group called @entity186 en @entity187 , or @entity192 ( helping women in @entity189 ) , whose then president and co-founder was @entity11 , @entity28 said			1
now in her early 30s in @entity193 , @entity170 told @entity28 she reluctantly agreed to the fake story about being a child sex slave : " @entity11 said that ... if i want to help another woman i have to do [ the interview ] very well , " she told the magazine			1
@entity170 was n't the only purported rescued girl telling fictions , according to the magazine			0
@entity202 claimed a woman kidnapped her and sold her to a brothel , where she was tortured and forced to undergo two crude abortions			0
@entity206 alleged an angry pimp gouged out one of her eyes with a piece of metal			0
@entity11 rescued @entity206 , and @entity206 ' story was recounted by @entity15 columnist @entity213 in 2009			2
in 2008 , he also profiled @entity11 in a column headlined " a heroine from the brothels			0
" but @entity206 ' family , neighbors and doctor contradicted her account : a physician performed surgery on a nonmalignant tumor covering her right eye when she was 13 , and medical records clearly showed her eye before and after the surgery , @entity28 said			0
@entity206 was then sent to @entity11 's group to be part of a vocational training program , an eye hospital director told the magazine			0
this week , the foundation ended its relationship with @entity206 , also as a result of the law firm 's investigation into her background , @entity44 said			0
" we are permanently removing ms. @entity206 from any affiliation with the organization or our grant partner , but will help her to transition into the next phase of her life , " @entity44 said .			0

@entity11 drew international attention for her personal tale of surviving sex slavery
she used that narrative to begin a foundation and *collect* money to save girls
but @entity28 reports this month that her personal story is untrue
@entity11 resigned from the foundation this week
