-- @entity2 war crimes suspect @entity3 was granted an emergency stay late tuesday to block what appeared to be his imminent deportation to @entity7			1
@entity9 agents remove @entity3 from his home tuesday			1
the ruling , handed down by the 6th @entity13 @entity12 , came less than two hours after federal immigration officials took @entity3 into custody at his home near @entity17 , @entity18			1
@entity3 , 89 , is wanted by @entity7 authorities for his alleged involvement during @entity21 in killings at @entity23 , a @entity2 death camp in @entity24			1
the @entity25 would not immediately comment on the stay , saying officials needed to review the order			0
the last - minute legal maneuvering leading to the order was the latest chapter in one of the longest - running pursuits of an alleged @entity35 perpetrator in history			2
the deportation of @entity3 , who had been transported to an @entity18 detention facility when the stay was issued , would set the stage for what would likely prove to be an extraordinary @entity7 war crimes trial			1
" upon due consideration of the motion for a stay and the opposition by the attorney general , we conclude that a stay of removal is warranted , " the circuit court wrote			1
representatives of attorney general @entity52 argued in response to an emergency motion filed by @entity3 's attorney that the circuit court does not have jurisdiction over the case			1
but the court acted anyway			2
" because it is our understanding that the government may remove the petitioner later today , we are compelled to rule on the motion for a stay prior to addressing the jurisdictional concerns raised by the government , " the court said			0
on friday , a federal immigration board rejected an emergency appeal for a stay of @entity3 's deportation			1
his attorney , @entity70 , had argued that deporting him would constitute torture because of his health problems			0
@entity70 has said @entity3 suffers from pre-leukemia , kidney problems , spinal problems and " a couple of types of gout			2
" when @entity70 filed another appeal with the 6th @entity12 , @entity25 officials said they believe that his chances of getting the board 's ruling overturned are slim			0
" looking at what 's going on in @entity17 ... is truly appalling , " @entity70 said shortly after @entity3 was taken into custody			1
" you have an 89 - year - old man with various physical ailments , and you have eight guys from [ @entity9 ] trying to stuff him into a wheelchair to send him to @entity7			1
this looks like something taking place in @entity7 and not in the @entity13			2
" rabbi @entity94 of the @entity95 found irony in @entity70 's argument for his client			0
" he wants to plead the sense of fairness that he regularly denied all of the victims at @entity23 , " @entity94 said			0
he called @entity3 's comparison of his planned deportation to torture " preposterous coming from a person that served the [ @entity2 organization ] @entity109 in a death camp			1
it is a preposterous argument and insulting to the survivors of the @entity35			0
" @entity94 said that 250,000 @entity113 were killed at the camp and that none of the guards who worked there was blameless			0
" you were there for one job : kill the @entity113 , " he said			0
" and that 's what they did full - time			2
" he called the evidence against @entity3 " overwhelming			2
" @entity7 authorities issued an arrest warrant for @entity3 on march 10 , accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at @entity23 from march to september 1943			1
the warrant was issued after the authorities concluded that an identification card provided by the @entity13 @entity133 was genuine			0
@entity3 , a retired auto worker , has been fighting charges of @entity2 war crimes for more than two decades			1
he was previously extradited from the @entity13 to @entity136 , where he was convicted in 1986 of being " @entity137 , " a guard at the notorious @entity140 extermination camp			0
the conviction was overturned by @entity136 courts on appeal , and he returned to the @entity13			0
the @entity13 filed new charges against him in 1999 , again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard			2
he was stripped of @entity13 citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005 , after fighting his case all the way to the @entity150			0
@entity3 , a @entity151 , says he saw action in the @entity154 army and later was a prisoner of war held by the @entity7			1
@entity0 's @entity156 contributed to this report .			0

attorney general 's representatives said court has no jurisdiction
immigration agents picked up @entity3 at home near @entity17 , @entity18
@entity3 , 89 , has been fighting charges of @entity2 war crimes for 20 - plus years
@entity7 authorities accuse @entity3 of involvement in killings at @entity2 death camp
