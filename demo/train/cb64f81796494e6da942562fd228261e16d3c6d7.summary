-- having worked on seminal teen shows " @entity2 " and " @entity3 , " costume designer @entity4 is no stranger to dressing high - school - age characters			1
but there 's something about the teens from @entity9 that makes outfitting " @entity10 " -- which enters its fourth season with an october 11 premiere -- a unique experience			1
for one , @entity4 has to make sure everyone on the show about witches , vampires , werewolves -- oh , and " hybrid " vampire - werewolves -- looks fabulous covered in blood , as characters are routinely stabbed , bitten and shot			1
@entity4 is regularly tasked with finding six to eight of the same top or jacket to be worn during multiple scenes and takes			1
with all the gore , borrowing clothes from designers is often out of the question			0
" we do a lot of mall shopping because that 's the best way for us to get a lot of multiples , " she said			2
" sometimes we need more than we can get in @entity40 , " where the show is filmed			0
@entity42 fashion : outfitting ' revenge ' but when episodes call for flashbacks , which might take place in the 15th century , a trip to the mall simply wo n't do			2
" even though they are more challenging than the contemporary clothes , i enjoy doing the flashbacks most of all , " @entity4 said , noting the period pieces that are n't made in - house are often rented from costume companies			1
period pieces also come into play when @entity56 throws its annual decade dances			1
the trick to costuming such events , @entity4 said , is dressing the human high school students like " a teenager would interpret the period -- or at least what a teenager would pick out when they go to the fantastic @entity67 shop			1
" the centuries - old vampire characters , on the other hand , are meant to look " like they would have gotten things straight out of their vintage clothing storage closet , " @entity4 said			1
@entity42 fashion : outfitting ' @entity74 ' that 's not the only way viewers can differentiate between the living and the undead			0
@entity4 has created a dress code of sorts for each of the supernatural groups			1
while the regular humans on the show dress more or less like typical high school kids , the vampires have their own set of fashion rules			0
" we try and keep them timeless and not super trendy , " said @entity4 , who started working on the series at the end of its second season			1
" they have their comfort and what they like to wear within the realm of the decade			0
" besides , with many of the vampire characters , trying to blend in as mortal teenagers , @entity4 added , " we ca n't get too crazy in the clothing department			1
" with one notable exception : for characters @entity107 and @entity108 , both played by actress @entity110 , fashion is especially important as it helps viewers tell the lookalikes apart			0
@entity42 fashion : outfitting ' scandal ' when @entity110 is playing human teen @entity107 , she dons a lot of simple long - sleeve shirts and jeans ; whereas @entity108 , @entity107 's vampire doppelganger , is a bit more fashion - forward			2
" @entity108 has been around for hundreds of years , " @entity4 said			2
" she follows fashion trends a little more			0
( her clothes are ) edgier and sexier than what we put on @entity107			0
" and because the vampires that live within the @entity131 series have the power to control people simply by staring at them , they get to don more expensive threads			0
" maybe they can compel the salespeople into giving them what they want , " @entity4 said			2
" i like to think that @entity108 saw ( the ) tan @entity141 heels ( she wore during season 3 ) on some unsuspecting @entity143 socialite , and probably just compelled her to hand them over			0
" @entity42 fashion : outfitting ' @entity146 ' then there are the witches , like @entity149 ( @entity150 ) , which @entity4 said dress " a little bit earthier " with a " bohemian flair			2
" for the men , whether normal or paranormal , they 've got to look tough			0
" these days you ca n't go wrong with a great leather jacket , " @entity4 said			1
" plus , they hold up really well in a supernatural fight			0
