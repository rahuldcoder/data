@entity0 -- eccentric basketball star @entity2 and several other former @entity4 players have arrived in @entity5 to take part in a controversial basketball game on the birthday of @entity9 , the country 's young , unpredictable leader			1
the friendly contest is planned for wednesday , when @entity9 is believed to turn 31 , and features a number of @entity4 old - timers			1
it takes place just weeks after @entity5 shocked the world by announcing the purge and execution of @entity9 's once - powerful uncle			1
@entity20 , @entity2 's agent for 16 years , told @entity1 on sunday that @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 would play against the @entity27			1
as they waited at @entity0 airport for their flight on @entity5 carrier @entity31 , @entity2 and his teammates told @entity1 that the main purpose of the trip was sport			1
@entity2 said it was not his job to address concerns about the repressive state and lobby for the release of detained @entity43 citizen @entity42			2
" i 'm going to try and interact with him ( @entity9 ) on that point of love for sports			0
i like the guy , and he 's an awesome guy to me , " @entity2 said			2
" one thing is about showing people we can actually get along			0
let 's get along as human beings , not politicians			0
" it will be @entity2 's fourth trip to the secretive and isolated nation , part of a project he has described as " basketball diplomacy			2
" but the @entity62 says that it has nothing to do with @entity2 's visits to @entity5 and that attention should be focused on the brutality of @entity9 's regime			1
' friend for life ' @entity2 , 52 , struck up an unlikely friendship with @entity9 when he traveled to @entity5 for the first time in february , bringing a team of @entity73 for an exhibition game watched by @entity9 , who is a basketball fan			1
@entity9 later met and dined with the flamboyant basketball star , and @entity2 told his host he " had a friend for life , " shrugging off international condemnation of the country 's human rights record			1
however , on his last trip , which took place last month less than a week after @entity5 announced the execution of @entity9 's uncle and top aide , @entity87 , @entity2 did n't get to meet @entity9			1
the international outcry over the killing of @entity87 prompted @entity90 , the online betting company that had supported @entity2 's project , to withdraw its association with the event			2
but @entity2 has pressed on with the plan			0
" i 'm looking forward to playing and putting on a show in @entity5			0
this is strictly about the game and for the love of basketball , " @entity2 teammate @entity23 told @entity1 at the departure gate , where the players posed for photos with fellow travelers			2
three additional former @entity4 players will be added to the team in coming days and will be traveling independently to @entity107 with their assistants , @entity2 's agent said sunday			1
@entity5 : reality vs. the world according to @entity2 ' publicity stunt ' @entity2 met and coached the @entity5 team on his most recent trip			1
but @entity114 , a @entity115 basketball player who played against @entity5 in 1999 , said @entity2 should not underestimate the side : " the @entity5 were quite strong , well - built and tall as well , " he said			2
" they were very determined not to lose against @entity115			0
it was a friendly match , but i was a bit intimidated			0
" @entity114 was skeptical about @entity2 's diplomatic aims			0
" i do n't know @entity2 personally , but he is quite peculiar and does unexpected things , " he said			0
" i think he went to @entity5 as a publicity stunt , " @entity114 said			0
" on the other hand , @entity5 plays some high - quality basketball , so they could learn from his experience			0
" @entity115 table tennis player @entity128 , who was part of a joint @entity5 team that took part in the 1991 @entity132 , praised @entity2 's bid to break the ice with @entity107			1
" what @entity2 is doing now is personal , but i think he 's brave for doing it , " she told @entity1			2
" i believe sports definitely can help diplomacy , " @entity128 said			0
" sportsmanship is pure , and i think diplomatic results can come out through sports			0
" but the @entity43 government appears to be unconvinced			0
" i know it 's amusing or maybe interesting to talk about @entity2 , but i actually think the focus really should be on the brutality of the @entity5 regime he 's going to meet with , " @entity143 , a @entity62 spokeswoman , said last month at the time of @entity2 's previous trip			1
opinion : @entity2 smart on @entity5 ? @entity1 's @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report .			1
