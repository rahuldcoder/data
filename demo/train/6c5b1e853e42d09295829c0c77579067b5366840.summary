@entity0 , @entity1 -- closing arguments in the @entity6 child sexual abuse trial could begin as soon as thursday , judge @entity3 said monday			1
he said the defense will probably end its case midday wednesday , followed by the prosecution 's rebuttal			2
that should end wednesday afternoon , clearing the way for closing arguments thursday , less than two weeks after the start of what had been expected to be a three - week case			1
the defense case began monday , but testimony ended early because of " technical issues " involving witnesses , @entity3 told jurors			1
@entity6 , 68 , is on trial on 51 counts related to accusations of improper conduct and sexual abuse involving at least 10 boys over a 15 - year span			1
the former @entity29 assistant coach has denied the charges			0
at the conclusion of the trial , jurors will be sequestered in a hotel so outside influences can not affect their deliberations , @entity3 said			0
prosecutors wrapped up their case monday morning with brief testimony from the mother of one of the alleged victims			1
" he gave him clothes , he gave him gifts , " the mother of an accuser called @entity45 testified			0
" i just wish he 'd given him underwear to replace the underwear i could never find in my laundry			0
" the final prosecution witness testified monday that her son seemed to suffer from stomach ailments during the time he was visiting @entity6 and sometimes did not want to visit the former @entity29 assistant 's home			1
but she said she did not ask him about any possible abuse and still does not know what happened to him			0
" i did n't really want to hear , " she said , crying			0
@entity6 's child sex abuse allegations : in his own words the defense then opened its case with a former @entity29 coach who testified about @entity6 's stellar reputation in the community			1
@entity69 said that it was not uncommon for coaches and youths to use the shower at the same time , and that he had never seen anything inappropriate between @entity6 and a child			1
before monday 's testimony , @entity3 rejected defense arguments that the charges were too vague or the testimony did not support the claims			1
prosecutors did withdraw one charge of unlawful contact with a minor involving one of the defendants			0
the law was not in effect during the time the alleged misconduct occurred , prosecutors said			0
that left 51 charges pending against @entity6			1
a main focus of the defense 's strategy may be to attempt to poke holes in the prosecution 's case thus far			2
" a lot of people lied , " lawyer @entity101 said last monday in his opening statement			1
over four days , several people testified that @entity6 forced them to engage in sexual acts with him in various places , including showers in the @entity29 coaches ' locker room , hotel rooms and the basement of his home			2
' @entity114 ' describe seduction , molestation , betrayal one told jurors that @entity6 -- whom he met , like many of the accusers , through the @entity123 nonprofit for disadvantaged youths that the ex-coach founded -- had threatened him if he told others about the abuse			2
another said @entity6 warned he might send him home from a trip to @entity131 , where they 'd gone to watch a @entity29 bowl game , if he resisted the sexual advances			2
" there 's a tsunami of evidence against him , " veteran criminal defense attorney @entity135 said			0
the defense could challenge the accusers ' timetable , questioning if @entity6 could have committed the crimes they claim he did , when they say he did them			1
some of the accusers have civil attorneys , @entity101 noted last week , calling that unusual			0
others , he said , have a financial interest in the case , an allegation that was denied by the accusers and their attorneys			0
but @entity154 , who represents the accuser known as @entity156 , blasted @entity101 's assertion that his client and others detailed the abuse just so they could sue @entity6 , calling it nonsense			2
" does that mean that none of them are telling the truth , because they 've gone to hire a lawyer ? " he said			0
" the defense is expected to call an expert witness to testify that @entity6 may have histrionic personality disorder , which the @entity171 says describes people who act " in a very emotional and dramatic way that draws attention to themselves			1
" what is histrionic personality disorder ? the prosecution had presented as evidence what one accuser described as " creepy love letters , " written by @entity6 , that they argued were part of " grooming techniques " commonly employed by sexual predators			2
judge @entity3 issued an order friday allowing a defense motion to offer expert testimony from a psychologist who " will explain that the words , tones , requests and statements made in the letters are consistent with a person who suffers from a @entity197			1
" " the goal of a person suffering from this disorder in writing those letters would not necessarily be to groom or sexually consummate a relationship in a criminal manner , but rather to satisfy the needs of a psyche belabored by the needs of such a disorder , " the defense lawyers wrote in their motion			0
@entity6 was expected to be examined sunday by a prosecution psychologist related to the personality disorder defense , according to a source with knowledge with the case			1
it was not clear if that happened			0
another person who could testify is @entity218 , the accused ex-coach 's wife			0
while many alleged victims knew her , she is not accused of having witnessed any sexual abuse			0
lastly , there 's the question of whether @entity6 himself will take the stand			1
@entity101 told jurors last week that @entity6 routinely " got showers with kids " after working out and that he would say so later			2
@entity135 , the defense lawyer , said having the former coach testify may give him his best chance at avoiding jail time			1
" just maybe he can convince one juror to hold out , " the lawyer said			0
" a hung jury , right now , is a lot better than life without parole			0
" @entity6 trial : all you need to know @entity2 's @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			2

new : closing arguments could come thursday , judge says
new : testimony ended early monday because of " technical issues , " judge says
first defense witness says he never saw any inappropriate conduct
@entity6 may take the stand in his own defense , his lawyer has *suggested*
