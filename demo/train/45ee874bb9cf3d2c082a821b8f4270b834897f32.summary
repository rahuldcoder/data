-- the @entity1 is again the tallest building in @entity2 one year after the killing of @entity4 and more than 10 years after the attacks that brought them down			2
it is still a work in progress : the hulking steel structure known as the @entity11 is still 500 feet shorter than it will be when complete			1
but it is already a tribute to @entity15 resilience , a reminder that whatever devastation we face , we can still come back bigger and better than before			1
my wife and i live two blocks from ground zero			2
the transformation of our neighborhood over the past decade has been inspiring , if comparatively unheralded			2
the streets that were once covered in ash and smoke are now teeming with life			1
@entity30 is the fastest - growing residential neighborhood in @entity2 , with young families choosing to move into what had been a ghost town after dark for much of the past century			1
businesses are relocating to @entity30 as well , including many future tenants flocking to the @entity11			1
where @entity36 took the oath of office , at @entity40 , is again a vibrant crossroads at all hours			2
any determined idiot can do it			2
building is hard work but infinitely more interesting			2
it is an expression of faith in the future			0
we have been down a long road since the terrorist attacks of 9/11			0
and too often , the daily work of rebuilding does not get its due			0
but it is the main event , evidence of how we honor the past while moving on with life			1
this past weekend , i was in @entity60 , a city that was devastated by @entity61 just seven years ago			0
but its heart never stopped beating , and the love it inspires as an @entity15 treasure -- " like one long poem , " as @entity64 once wrote -- is stronger than ever			0
@entity69 closed out the first weekend of @entity70 , and in the afternoon sunlight , he played " @entity72 , " his post- 9/11 anthem of resilience and rebuilding			1
as he started to sing , a woman near me started crying			0
i do n't know the details of whom she lost that day , but it was a reminder of how the shadow of the past is never very far away			0
by the end of the song , comforted by her friends , she was again smiling through teary eyes and swaying to the music			0
the @entity72 is real , and we are living it			0
it is a tribute to all who we have lost and all that we have been through			1
most of all , it is the result of hard work			0
yes , there have been mistakes and missteps along the way			0
some would say with justification that this @entity11 milestone has been too long in coming , bogged down in red tape			1
but the path is less important than the destination			0
it is a towering act of defiance , reaching into the sky as evidence of our refusal to live in fear			0
the @entity11 and the neighborhood springing up around it are testimonials to our continued commitment to an idea embodied by the firefighters who died there on 9/11 : we have met the worst of humanity with the best of humanity			1
where others have destroyed , we will build			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity123 .			1

@entity123 : @entity11 is a tribute to resilience and *ability* to come back better than before
@entity30 is growing fast , he says , and streets once covered in ash are full of life
@entity123 says tower shows that we will build where others have destroyed , and we will endure
