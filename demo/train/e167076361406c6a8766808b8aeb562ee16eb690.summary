-- when @entity3 told her best friend , @entity4 , she was going to lose weight a few years ago , @entity1 politely replied , " good for you			1
you 'll have to let me know how it works out			2
" clearly , @entity1 had heard this before			1
in fact , she could look in the mirror herself and see that her friend 's history of starting and stopping diets with little success was similar to her own			2
the stay - at - home moms had been close since meeting in 2006 when their husbands were stationed in the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			2
@entity1 's family was transferred to @entity23 in 2009 , and that fateful phone conversation about losing weight took place shortly before christmas 2010			1
@entity1 hung up and thought about her friend 's pledge			1
she picked up the phone and called @entity3 back			1
" i 'm doing it with you , " @entity1 remembers telling @entity3			1
" i 'm going to start the same day you do , and i 'm going to start to figure this out			2
" they began january 6 , 2011			2
@entity3 weighed 336 pounds and squeezed into size 30 pants			1
@entity1 was 260 pounds and wore a size 24			1
leaning on each other as long - distance weight - loss " sponsors , " the women would go on to lose more than 200 pounds the first year			1
@entity43 and beautiful their husbands always told them they were beautiful , no matter how big they got			0
both women loved to eat and did n't think about exercise			0
before they knew it , they were obese			0
@entity1 , 38 , says she was chunky in high school , while @entity3 , 42 , was average size until she was about 20			1
both women said their weight ballooned after their first pregnancies			2
" i 'd like to say it was some traumatic event , " @entity1 says			1
" i had a lot of fun in my 20s and 30s and just did n't pay attention			0
before i knew it , i was way up			0
" @entity3 tells a similar story			1
" i gained some , then i 'd lose some , but i would n't lose all of it , and then i 'd gain more than i lost			0
it just kept creeping up and up ... and then i just decided , " well , this is me			0
" @entity1 cooked healthy meals for her children but indulged on her own			1
chicken without the skin removed , heavy pastas , wings and beer were all in frequent rotation			0
@entity3 would make two 9 - by - 13 pans of white chocolate bread pudding at @entity79 -- one for the family and one for herself			1
physical and emotional difficulties being obese took a physical toll on both women and their families			0
for @entity3 , just walking to the car from her front door caused her to break out into a sweat			1
if she went to one of her kids ' sports games , she would watch from the car because the field was too far to walk			0
" say you go to @entity96 -- i could n't do both the grocery side and the regular side			0
i had to choose one side one day and the other side another day because i could n't do the whole store and then get back out to the car , too			0
" being overweight was also hard emotionally for @entity1			1
getting ready for military functions was torture			0
she would agonize over what to wear , needing her husband to hold her hand as she cried while getting dressed			2
her lowest point came in fall 2010 when a stranger at a gas station -- heavy himself -- made a nasty comment about the size of her rear end			0
months later , the comment still stung			0
the turning point in 2010 , @entity3 developed sleep apnea , a disorder commonly associated with obesity in which breathing at night starts and stops			1
she was tired all the time , often fell asleep during the day and snored so loudly her husband had to sleep on the couch many nights			2
" i thought , ' oh my gosh , all the things i ca n't do anymore , and now i ca n't even sleep , ' " she says			0
rather than go for more medical tests , she resolved to solve the problem herself			0
that 's when she called @entity1			1
after @entity1 pledged to lose weight too , the women agreed to start in the new year			1
attainable goals @entity3 knew counting calories would work best for her			1
she used the @entity137 app @entity135 , which calculates how many calories to consume based on how much weight someone wants to lose per week			1
it adds calories back when you exercise			0
@entity3 allowed herself to eat fruits and bread but cut out soda and enriched flour			1
for the first year , she plugged every single thing she ate into the app. @entity1 followed the @entity149 , a plan that encourages replacing " bad " carbohydrates and fats with " good " carbs and fats , lean protein and low - fat dairy			1
she ordered " the @entity161 " book and two @entity149 cookbooks , got rid of all the enriched flour and alcohol in the house , switched to whole grains and documented her meals and twice - weekly weigh - ins in a journal for the first eight months			1
they set goals they thought they could meet			0
@entity1 sought to get below 200 pounds , while @entity3 wanted to sleep through the night			1
the first few weeks , it took all their willpower just to focus on their food			0
" it was like i was coming down off drugs , " @entity3 says			1
i literally had the shakes			0
the first couple of weeks were just absolute torture			0
" once they adjusted to the new eating plans , they started thinking about exercise			0
three mornings a week , @entity1 took her 4 - year - old to the mall , and they did laps together			1
@entity3 started with one block			1
she gradually added distance until she felt comfortable joining the @entity191			0
they were both realistic about what they could manage			0
" i did n't say , ' i need to walk for an hour			0
' when i first went to the gym , i did the elliptical , and i could only do it for 10 minutes , " @entity3 says			1
" and then i gradually would add to that time			0
then i went to my very first group class , which i was absolutely terrified to do			0
i was constantly trying to push myself to do something more or longer or harder			0
" eventually the women were running and working out regularly on machines and in classes			0
it took losing 75 pounds to stop @entity3 's snoring			1
by that time , she says she thought , " my gosh , if i could lose this , why do n't i keep going ? " some friends were n't supportive			0
@entity1 called them her " saboteurs " -- overweight pals who would try to tempt her into having " one bite " of cake , or who made her feel bad about spending her mornings at the gym instead of joining them for breakfast			1
but @entity3 and @entity1 always had each other			1
the first month , they talked on the phone three times a day			0
over the next several months , they would check in for twice - weekly weigh - ins and call whenever they slipped in their diets or needed to vent			0
they would treat each other to weekend visits in @entity23 or @entity21 , where they would marvel at how the other had shrunk			0
when @entity1 moved back to @entity21 last year , supporting each other became even easier			1
they live close to one another and work out together most mornings at the @entity191			0
besides taking @entity232 , abs , boot camp and weight - training classes , they 're training for the @entity237 race in @entity238			2
and more than 280 pounds later , they still call each other when they fall off the wagon			2
the payoff @entity3 no longer has to bring a chair for her kids ' sports events			1
she 's even able to play an entire parents - vs. - kids soccer game herself			2
she also has a lot more friends			0
" before , i had to be at home a lot because going out anywhere was hard on me , " @entity3 says			2
" and now , it 's just like my world has expanded			2
i have more people and friends in my life now than i have in a long , long time			0
" and when @entity1 gets an invitation to a military ball these days , she 's no longer self - conscious about how she looks			1
both @entity3 and @entity1 say they 're heard from friends and gym acquaintances who say they 've inspired them			1
" i had somebody come up to me a few months ago and she said , ' i see you here all the time			0
sometimes i do not feel like coming in here and working out , but then i think , well you know that girl 's going to be there , so i 'm going to go too			2
' that 's been icing on the cake , " @entity3 says			1
the women know there 's no end date			2
they say they will always be food addicts			0
@entity3 is a pound away from her original goal of 165 pounds but trying to get down to 154			1
she still uses her @entity277 app and has calorie counts memorized for everything she eats			1
@entity1 dropped 111 pounds in the first 10 months and at 149 pounds is now in maintenance mode			1
she still sticks to the major tenets of the @entity149 -- no enriched flour , light on carbs , heavy on protein and veggies			2
at parties , @entity1 will " taste " most things but fill her plate with healthier options			2
she says it 's been a healthy change for her whole family			2
her kids have learned to eat pancakes with whole - wheat flour and no - sugar syrup as well as brown rice and couscous , and her husband has lost 40 pounds			2
" i will always worry about getting heavy again , " @entity1 says			2
" i am not saying i wo n't take a day off from the gym or eat food that is unhealthy , but i have to keep myself in check forever			0
