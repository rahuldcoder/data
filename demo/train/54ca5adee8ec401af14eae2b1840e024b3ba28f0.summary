@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is a jolly man who laughs easily and likes to say " forget it " a lot			1
he 'd like to forget the devastation wrought at the @entity0 harbor where his fleet of trucks used to pick up cargo			1
tuesday 's 7.0 - magnitude earthquake sent a quarter - mile pier crumbling into the sea along with two of his trucks			1
the few workers who went into the water swam to safety , @entity3 said , but the port remains shut down , and desperately needed aid can not be unloaded quickly			1
" now we 're just starving to death , " he said , worried that the airport and smaller harbors can not handle the necessary volume of relief supplies			1
" that was the whole country right there , " he added , pointing at two toppled cranes on the remains of the pier that stand out against the clear - blue sky			2
@entity3 owns @entity33 , a fleet of 35 trucks that haul cargo from the port			1
the company employed about 50 employees , all of them now out of work			2
" i 'm out , " @entity3 said			2
the port wo n't be back for a while			1
roads have been split apart and buckled , fences have fallen over			2
" oh , forget it , " @entity3 said			2
it might take a year to rebuild it			2
" yet he feels fortunate because although his home was destroyed and his business is shattered , no one in his family died in the quake			2
asked what happened , he demurs with a hearty laugh			2
" forget it , " he says			0
" i do n't want to talk about it			0
" he then relents , calling his family 's survival " a miracle			1
" his wife was outside their house and he was driving home in his red 1995 @entity69 sport utility vehicle			0
" i felt like the whole car was going to take off like an airplane , " he said , laughing			0
he was n't wearing a seat belt , he admits			0
in @entity74 , i wear a seat belt			0
@entity3 ' 40 - year - old daughter , @entity78 , and her 15 - month - old son had just left earlier that afternoon to return to her home in @entity81 , @entity82			0
asked if it was a miracle that she missed the quake by such a short time , he laughs again , saying , " you bet your sweet heart			0
" on friday , he was wearing a bullet - proof vest after someone tried to rob him the day before			0
someone wanted to take his cell phone he said , and the port is near the roughest part of town			1
for now , @entity3 and his wife are sleeping in a tent			0
and for now , also , his mind is on the port			1
tug boat owner @entity100 also seem a dim future without the port			1
" we can not receive the help by plane , " @entity100 said friday			0
" we need to receive help by boat			0
" @entity100 estimates that before the earthquake , more than 70 ships each unloaded about 8,000 tons of material every month			1
" i personally unload three or four a day , " he said			0
" the whole country depends on this port			1
if we 're going to save people , we have to do it by boat			0
" without the port , @entity3 sees serious consequences for @entity1 , one of the poorest nations on @entity120			1
" we 'll starve to death , that 's all , " he said			1
" we 'll just starve to death			1
" and it wo n't take long for trouble to reach the streets , he said			0
especially since many of the nation 's criminals escaped when @entity0 's prison collapsed in the quake			1
" very soon we 're going to have a riot , " @entity3 said , this time not laughing			0
how soon ? " i do n't give you a week , " he said			0
no laugh there either .			0
