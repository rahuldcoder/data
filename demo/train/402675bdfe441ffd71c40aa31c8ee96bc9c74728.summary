@entity0 -- a proposal to reduce nuclear weapons highlighted the debate within the @entity8 government about when and how to get rid of nuclear weapons on its soil , a new @entity3 document shows			1
its release also reveals the presence of nuclear weapons in several @entity16 countries and @entity17 , information not normally released by @entity19			0
during a meeting with two @entity22 diplomats , @entity8 national security adviser @entity23 expressed his reservations about the @entity8 government coalition 's proposal to remove all tactical nuclear weapons from @entity8 , according to a november 2009 @entity29 cable published by @entity3			1
in february , five countries -- @entity31 , @entity8 , @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34 -- sent a joint letter to @entity19 secretary general @entity36 , signed by their respective foreign ministers , calling for a debate about @entity19 's nuclear policy			2
@entity8 foreign minister @entity41 has called for the removal of all nuclear weapons from @entity8 soil			2
however , @entity23 distanced the @entity8 government from the proposal they had signed onto , claiming that " this had been forced upon them by @entity50 , " the cable said			1
@entity23 told the @entity22 diplomats that " from his perspective , it made no sense to unilaterally withdraw ' the 20 ' tactical nuclear weapons still in @entity8 while @entity56 maintains ' thousands ' of them			1
it would only be worth it if both sides drew down , " the @entity22 cable said			0
@entity22 assistant secretary for @entity16 and @entity63 affairs @entity62 responded by noting the importance of considering the potential consequences of a @entity8 proposal before moving forward			1
the cable continues , " a withdrawal of nuclear weapons from @entity8 and perhaps from @entity31 and the @entity33 could make it very difficult politically for @entity17 to maintain its own stockpile , even though it was still convinced of the need to do so			2
" @entity73 , director of the @entity74 at the @entity75 , says the cable shows the intense deliberations going on in the @entity8 political process			1
" the new in that is that it shows the battle going on inside the @entity8 government between the foreign minister and other elements of the government on this issue of how to push this issue of tactical nuclear weapons within the alliance			2
" the @entity89 defines tactical or nonstrategic nuclear weapons as " short - range weapons " which can include land - based missiles with a range of less than 500 kilometers ( about 310 miles ) and air - and sea - launched weapons with a range of less than 600 kilometers ( about 370 miles )			0
according to the @entity96 , the @entity22 has 500 tactical nuclear weapons in its arsenal , of which approximately 200 are deployed in @entity16			0
the cable does not identify the origin of the nuclear weapons in any of the four countries , but the @entity22 or @entity19 have military bases in all of them			0
according to @entity73 , these weapons are @entity22			0
he points out that the @entity107 do not have tactical nuclear weapons , and the @entity109 keep their tactical nuclear weapons on their home soil			0
" we do n't comment on the placements of nuclear weapons , " @entity19 spokeswoman @entity112 told @entity1			0
" as a matter of policy , we do n't comment on leaked confidential documents of any sort			0
we think diplomats should be able to talk to each other in confidence , because otherwise there is a risk that tensions can get out of control			0
" as for @entity23 's reference to " the 20 " weapons on his country 's soil , @entity73 says it is not clear whether he is actually confirming that amount of weapons , or if he is using the estimate in a report written by @entity73 in 2005 , which was picked up by @entity8 media and government officials as part of the debate			2
" very few people in the @entity8 government know the exact number of weapons , and it 's not clear to me that the national security adviser would know			1
" on the coupling of @entity8 and @entity56 denuclearization proposed by @entity23 , @entity73 says that would make very little sense			1
" it would be very strange to see formal linking of very small number of weapons in @entity8 with the large inventory of tactical nuclear weapons @entity56 has in general			1
it 's apples and oranges			0
@entity56 tactical nuclear weapons , their location and their mission is not linked to whether there are nuclear weapons in @entity8			1
" @entity73 estimates that @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity8 each have between 10 and 20 tactical nuclear weapons on their soil , and there are 60 to 70 in @entity17 .			2

the @entity8 national security adviser is cool to a proposal to remove nukes from @entity8
he said " it made no sense *...* while @entity56 maintains ' thousands , ' " a cable says
the cable shows intense deliberations in @entity8 , an *analyst* says
