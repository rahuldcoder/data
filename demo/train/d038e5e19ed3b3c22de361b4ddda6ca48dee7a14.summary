" did @entity0 with @entity1 ? " â€” monday 's top headline on the @entity5 's website " do n't both teams have to play with the football ? " a @entity9 friend of mine promptly inquired in a post , mystified as to how the @entity12 could come under investigation by the @entity14 for " deflating " any of the balls used in sunday 's conference championship game versus the @entity17			1
a fair question about an unfair tactic , to be sure			2
ok , under further review , let us take a look at this weird , wild , farcical , you - got ta - be-kidding - me " controversy " that has , uh , blown up unexpectedly			2
it became the talk of talk radio monday			2
and you could picture every staff writer employed by @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and others tapping furiously on their laptops , coming up with joke after joke			2
it was confirmed by an @entity14 official that the league was looking into the pretty preposterous possibility that balls used in @entity12 's easy 45 - 7 victory at @entity44 were not adequately inflated			1
yep , people actually now wonder whether you can get an extra edge from @entity44			0
@entity12 superstar quarterback @entity47 had the question put to him monday on a radio interview and called it ridiculous , saying , " i think i 've heard it all			1
" the idea , cockeyed as it is , would be that a football would be considerably easier to catch and grip if it were filled with slightly less air than usual			1
particularly in wet , chilly weather like that found on a january evening in @entity59			0
five things to know for the @entity61 to the aforementioned question as to the teams using exactly the same ball -- i.e. , so where 's the advantage ? -- each @entity14 team , according to rule 2 , section 2 of league bylaws , will " make 12 primary balls available for testing by the referee 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the starting time of the game			1
" the home team " will also make 12 backup balls available for testing			1
" eight other balls , sealed in a box by the manufacturer , are marked by the referee and " used exclusively for the kicking game			0
" i do n't know if an actual scale is used , like a jockey or a boxer making weight , but a football is supposed to weigh between 14 and 15 ounces			0
if there are weight - loss programs for overweight footballs , this would be the first i have heard of it			1
" @entity92 " show on @entity91 could get a whole season out of something like this			0
naturally , conspiracy theorists could speculate that the @entity12 somehow finagled a way into using a deflated ball themselves , giving mr. @entity47 a little help , while making sure that the visiting team 's quarterback , @entity100 of the @entity17 , had to pass a football that was more tightly inflated than a @entity104 balloon			1
i have never heard of this accusation being made in all the years i have been following professional football			0
i mean , come on : " honey , you did n't blow up the @entity109 ? " how devious could a team be ? however , i did indeed have awareness of a similar situation occurring in college football , as recently as 2012			2
it involved the @entity115 , a splendid school , my own daughter 's alma mater			2
@entity115 was fined $ 25,000 by its conference for being caught doing exactly that -- messing with the air in the football			0
a student manager was responsible			0
the university said he did it on his own , apparently without the knowledge of a single other human being in then - coach @entity125 's football program , deflating no fewer than five footballs to be used in a @entity115 game against @entity128			1
three bad balls were discovered by officials before the game , two more at halftime			0
the kid was later fired , the university was fined and reprimanded by the @entity134 and , much the way @entity47 put it monday , a lot of us ended up saying : " i 've heard it all now			0
" turned out ( it was news to me at the time ) that in college football , schools provide their own footballs , whereas in pro football , the exact same 18 balls are used by both teams			2
who knew ? it is difficult not to laugh at the thought of @entity152 , the generally humorless head coach of the @entity12 , masterminding some kind of sinister dr. @entity155 plot to deflate a certain number of those footballs , then having a co-conspirator somehow sneak the soft balls into the game when @entity12 it was on offense , then the harder balls into the game when @entity165 had it			1
" @entity167 ! " the villainous @entity152 would laugh to himself			0
" i outsmarted them again ! " except what are the odds of something like this actually happening ? i appreciate that the @entity12 have been so successful over the years that they have been accused of everything short of spying on their opponents from the @entity176			1
i personally believe the @entity12 win most of their games because they score more points than the other team does			1
they will be going to another @entity61 this year , the one coming up february 1 in @entity181 , @entity182 , because the @entity12 know how to play football , not how to blow one up			1
even so , their opponents , the @entity184 , had better come prepared			0
i suggest they bring a scale			0
join us on @entity9 / @entity188 .			0
