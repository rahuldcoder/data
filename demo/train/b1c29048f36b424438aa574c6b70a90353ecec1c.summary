@entity1 , @entity0 -- in an underground bunker in the heart of @entity6 a unique experiment is taking place			1
going underground : " quiet : @entity13 " volunteers lived in tiny boxes in an artificial society with their every move filmed 24 - hours a day			1
more than 100 people have moved into an artificial society where their every move will be captured on film			0
living like battery hens in tiny cubes stacked one on top of the other , these exhibitionists have signed up to live -- to eat , sleep , shower , party , go to the toilet and even have sex with each other -- under the unwavering gaze of hundreds of cameras recording 24 hours a day			0
everything is free but participants must wear uniforms , submit to regular " interrogations " and , of course , give up any notion of privacy , not to mention freedom			0
the atmosphere lies somewhere between the factory , @entity41 's hip 1960s studio famed for its parties , and a sci - fi version of the infamous @entity44			0
it may sound like the latest extreme reality tv show but , in fact , this extraordinary experiment took place in late 1999 , at the turn of the millennium			2
the first @entity53 tv show had been broadcast only a few months previously in @entity54 and the internet as we know it was still in its infancy			0
the project was called " quiet : @entity13 " and the man behind it , described as the " @entity41 of the web , " was extreme visionary and dotcom entrepreneur , @entity60			1
now , almost 10 years later , the cameras are back on , and this time @entity60 himself is under the spotlight			1
" @entity13 , " which was awarded the @entity67 at this year 's @entity68 , is a documentary by director @entity70 which chronicles the rise and fall of @entity60 , " the greatest internet pioneer you 've never heard of			1
" she describes @entity60 ' life as a cautionary tale			1
is the internet just another handy tool or is it fundamentally changing the way we behave ? tell us below in the @entity82 box			0
@entity60 was one of the crop of highly publicized wunderkind entrepreneurs splashed across magazine covers , making millions of dollars during the mid- 1990s dotcom bubble			1
he was among the first people to recognize the potential of the @entity77 and in 1994 , @entity60 used some of his estimated $ 80 million fortune to found @entity91 , the first internet television network			1
it was an idea so ahead of its time that it would be another seven years before broadband -- which internet television requires to work effectively -- was in general use in @entity97			0
@entity60 ' foresight did n't stop there			2
he was convinced he could anticipate the future effects of this new technology on human behavior			2
he believed that people would be willing to go to any lengths to share their lives -- that @entity41 's 15 minutes of fame in a lifetime would n't be enough ; that people would want their 15 minutes of fame every day			2
@entity60 set up the " @entity111 " bunker to prove his point , saying that people would want a piece of the " fame " the project offered despite the extreme conditions , and asked @entity70 to " document the cultural history " as it happened			1
on january 1 , 2000 , just thirty days after @entity60 launched his extraordinary project , it was shut down as a " millennial cult " by @entity97 agency , @entity121			2
soon after , @entity60 attempted to reprise the experiment , but this time it was more extreme and he and his girlfriend were the guinea pigs			1
he fitted 32 motion - controlled cameras and 60 microphones in his @entity129 apartment to record live streaming video of every aspect of their private lives 24/7 , which web site users could watch and comment on in a forum			2
@entity60 wanted to see what would happen if he exposed his entire life to the public , and planned to live like this for three months			1
he even planned for his girlfriend to conceive in public			0
" our life became tied to the watchers , " remembers @entity60			1
" they were actually another brain that was controlling us ... they were influencing , maybe not controlling , but they were certainly influencing us and sometimes we did n't know that they were doing it			0
" living this way put an unbearable strain on his relationship and the couple broke up before the experiment could be completed			0
meanwhile , @entity60 lost his fortune when the dotcom bubble burst in 2000			2
soon after , he had a nervous breakdown and moved to upstate @entity6 , withdrawing completely from from public life			0
the five thousand hours of footage timoner shot during the " @entity111 " bunker experiment were left untouched for nearly a decade			0
@entity70 admits that it is only very recently that the events of 10 years ago started to make sense to her			2
she says it has taken her this long to understand @entity60 , " as a visionary , what he predicts , and also what he embodies as a walking cautionary tale of taking technology too far			1
" but , according to @entity70 -- who won the grand jury prize at @entity68 once before for " @entity172 ! " , another cautionary tale about the rise and fall of front men from @entity97 rock bands @entity177 and @entity178 -- @entity60 ' story is a universal one - and heralds a future where privacy is a distant memory from the past			1
" that is your story			0
it 's all of our story right now , and now is the tipping point where the virtual world is starting to take over			0
" @entity193 contributed to this story			0

@entity70 documentary " @entity13 " is about @entity77 visionary @entity60
@entity60 said the @entity198 would rule our lives and created an experiment to prove it
he turned the experiment on himself with terrible consequences for his life
