@entity0 -- @entity2 of @entity0 blasted the city 's new @entity3 on thursday , saying it wo n't deter teen pregnancy and inappropriately shames and stigmatizes its target audience			1
the campaign " creates stigma , hostility and negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people , " said @entity7 , the organization 's vice president of education and training			1
" the city 's money would be better spent helping teens access health care , birth control and high - quality sexual and reproductive health education , not on an ad campaign intended to create shock value			1
" the @entity28 / @entity27 announced the $ 400,000 initiative , which features pictures of babies delivering messages to their hypothetical parents such as " honestly , mom ... chances are he wo n't stay with you			1
what happens to me ? " the small print adds that 90 % of teen parents do n't marry each other			2
" @entity44 , you 'll be paying to support me for the next 20 years , " says another of the ads , which adds in smaller print that " ny state law requires a parent to pay child support until a child is 21			1
" " got a good job ? i cost thousands of dollars each year , " says another , which adds that teen parents should expect to spend more than $ 10,000 a year to raise their child			0
" teens giving birth before they are ready to provide emotional and financial support is not a good way to raise children , " said administration commissioner @entity56			2
" we can not dictate how people live their lives , and sometimes even the best plans do n't work out , but we must encourage responsibility and send the right message , especially to young people			1
" @entity2 , an advocacy group and provider of reproductive health services and education , said wednesday in a statement that the ads propagate stereotypes and fail to address the societal problems that lead to teen pregnancies			1
a city spokeswoman defended the ads , calling them but one part of a larger initiative that will include an interactive texting and social media campaign and a @entity84 video public service announcement			0
" this campaign is part of the city 's comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention program , which includes sex education , increased access to birth control and partnerships with community - based organizations , " said @entity85 , deputy press secretary for mayor @entity86			2
the city runs a school - based education program in which teen mothers and fathers discuss with peers the challenges of raising a child			2
a state - run family planning benefit program covers reproductive and sexual health care , including contraceptives , to low - income teens and adults			0
and a citywide relationship abuse prevention program lays out the consequences of teen pregnancy and how to avoid peer pressure and coercion			0
since 2011 , the city has mandated comprehensive sex education in public schools			0
the city 's pregnancy rate for females has dropped by 27 % over the past decade , but it is still higher than the national average , according to the mayor 's office , which launched the campaign on monday			0
" daughters of teen parents are more likely to become teen mothers themselves , while sons are more likely to go to prison , " it said in a statement			0
" on the other hand , parents who finish high school , find full - time work and get married before having children have a 98 % chance of not living in poverty			2
" @entity2 said that it supports the initiatives and recognizes the importance of awareness and education , but added that the rate of teen pregnancies is affected by economic and societal factors such as poverty , violence , limited access to health care , as well as gender , racial and ethnic inequalities			1
" teenage parenthood is simply not the disastrous and life - compromising event these ads portray , " it said			0
" it 's time we focus on the root causes rather than point fingers at teen parents and their children			0
" last year , @entity86 pledged a $ 250,000 matching gift to the @entity2 after the @entity164 for the @entity166 foundation cut off grants to @entity2 for breast cancer screenings			2
the foundation later reversed its decision			0
according to data compiled by the @entity171 to prevent teen and @entity173 in its 2012 publication , " why it matters : @entity175 , @entity176 , and @entity177 , " roughly 48 % of mothers ages 15 to 19 lived below the poverty line			1
as their children grow up , their likelihood of living in poverty increases according to @entity184 , a spokeswoman for the organization			0
some 41 % of women who gave birth before 20 were living in poverty within the first year of their child 's birth , while the chances of living in poverty rose to 50 % when their child reached 3 , @entity184 said .			1
