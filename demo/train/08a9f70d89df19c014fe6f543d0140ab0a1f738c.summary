-- he 's been decorated with awards and called one of the world 's most influential people			2
he 's addressed packed auditoriums and waved to crowds who line streets just to catch a passing glimpse of him			2
he 's shaken the hands of countless global dignitaries and earned a fan base following on @entity14 that might rival that of @entity17 stars			1
he is his holiness the @entity1 , the 74 - year - old spiritual leader of @entity19 and the head of the @entity21 , based in @entity22 , @entity23			1
and though he describes himself , according to his web site , as " a simple @entity28 monk , " the love so many @entity24 and others have for him has , no doubt , bestowed on him iconic status -- whether he sees it that way or not			1
" i 'd love to be in his presence			0
i 'd love to be in an audience where he speaks , " said @entity35 , 55 , of @entity36 , @entity37 , who has yet to have that pleasure			0
" i yearn for it			0
i watch his schedule to see if / when he 'll be in my area			0
... i love what he stands for			0
his inner peace inspires me to find mine , daily			1
" she 's far from alone in her admiration			2
a @entity54 survey released thursday , the same day the @entity1 visited the @entity52 , showed that 56 percent of @entity24 hold a favorable view of him , putting him " in the same neighborhood as other major religious figures , " said @entity0 polling director @entity56			1
" favorable ratings for the pope , at 59 percent , and @entity61 , at 57 percent , are virtually identical			2
" not bad for a guy who lives on the opposite side of the globe , is entrenched in a decades - old political and cultural struggle many do n't understand , and lives according to a tradition few @entity24 follow			2
less than 1 percent of @entity24 identify themselves as @entity28 , with less than 0.3 percent of those being @entity28 , according to the @entity68			1
but what he represents resonates with @entity24 who may need a figure like the @entity1 to look to , said @entity72 , executive director of @entity74 's @entity73 , an organization dedicated to preserving @entity77 culture and civilization			1
" he stands for achieving peace by way of peace , and since @entity82 and @entity83 are n't around , he 's a placeholder for that kind of position , " he said			1
" he says he 's a ' simple monk , ' but that 's wishful thinking			2
he 's a monk that 's been saddled with the responsibility of shouldering the hopes and dreams of millions of @entity77 people			2
... he 's doing the best he can with that , and frankly , these are the kind of people we admire			0
" not that @entity72 , 42 , always treated the @entity1 with this kind of reverence			2
his father , @entity102 , co-founded the @entity73 , is an @entity104 studies professor at @entity105 and holds the first endowed chair in @entity28 studies in the @entity108 , according to the university 's online biography			1
the older @entity72 , who also happens to be the father of actress @entity112 , was a personal student of the @entity1 , and it was through this relationship that his son first met the spiritual leader			1
" my earliest memory of meeting him , i was around 4			0
i was a pretty rambunctious 4 - year - old , " he said with a laugh , guessing that he probably jumped on his holiness and grabbed at the man 's glasses			0
" diplomatic protocol was n't high on my list of priorities			0
" @entity126 has known the @entity1 since he was a child			2
he worked in the exile government and served as the spiritual leader 's representative in @entity74 and @entity37 during the 1970s and 1980s			1
now the president of @entity131 , a @entity132 , @entity133 , organization that promotes peace , @entity126 said he organized the @entity77 leader 's first visit to the @entity24 in 1979 , 20 years after he had gone into exile he recalled not being sure they 'd be able to pull off the visit because by the early 1970s , the @entity24 had normalized its relations with @entity141 , which has long viewed the @entity1 as a threat to its national unity on the issue of @entity77 autonomy			1
but they came at the invitation of various colleges and religious groups , and the @entity24 fascination with the @entity1 -- the curiosity about his exotic past , his beliefs and his teachings -- spoke volumes then , @entity126 said			1
in the decades since , the @entity1 's star power has only risen as @entity24 have learned more about his commitment to nonviolence , interfaith outreach and more			1
for starters , there was that @entity162 he won in 1989			0
high - profile supporters , like actor @entity164 , helped give him and his people 's struggles pop culture prominence , as did several mainstream films including " @entity169 , " starring @entity170 , and " @entity171 , " directed by @entity172			0
with the increased exposure , there has also been a growing prevalence of " @entity19 " bumper stickers , the appearance of @entity77 prayer flags in suburbia and @entity14 fans who shower the @entity1 with praise			1
" have a nice and easy day with @entity182 ! @entity184 , " one woman wrote thursday			0
" thank you for all your love , guidance and wisdom ... u changed my life , " a man added			0
and then this from a college - student fan : " @entity192 ! ! you kick metaphorical ass ! ! ! " how has all this attention not gone to his head ? " when fame happens , people get carried away , right ? the @entity1 , despite tremendous adoration as well as adulation ... is very conscious of that , " @entity126 said			1
" one of the @entity28 practices is to always be very aware of one 's self and how one looks at one 's self and not to be carried away with one 's ego			2
" not standing on formalities -- he playfully threw snow at reporters outside the @entity52 on thursday -- staying grounded and his constant ability to exude warmth and joy have made him easy to love , people who admire him say			0
" he really is the real deal -- a truly loveable guy			0
he lives his values , " said @entity220 , executive vice president of the @entity221 , a global organization that seeks to increase understanding and relationships between the @entity24 and @entity224			1
" recognizing someone who lives their life according to such positive principles helps us all grow			0
" and @entity220 , who said he 's met the @entity192 three times , suggested the @entity141 government , through its denunciation of the spiritual leader , has bolstered his recognition			1
he said that by saying the @entity1 is " a wolf in sheep 's clothing , " a claim @entity220 said does n't match what people read and see , " the @entity141 are doing a great deal to turn him into a rock star			1
" but nothing does more to make people appreciate the @entity1 than being with him , said @entity247 , a psychiatrist with @entity248			2
@entity247 , who 's been involved in a program where @entity251 doctors work with and exchange teachings with @entity28 monks , recounted a time when he , his wife and several others met with the @entity192 about four years ago			0
" many people , myself included , have a powerful experience in his presence			0
i nearly erupted in tears , " he said			0
and his wife , whom he said " does not have a religious bone in her body " was " just beaming			0
" he said studies have long shown that people have a physiological response to the behaviors , feelings and even smells put forth by others			0
" @entity276 , " he added , " say that sweet smells come from a saint -- a mark of spiritual advancement			1

the @entity1 , @entity19 's spiritual leader , has broad base of fans in @entity24
his sense of peace inspires ; 56 percent of @entity24 view him favorably , poll shows
he fills *symbolic* placeholder left by @entity82 and @entity83 , @entity73 executive says
@entity276 helps him avoid *trappings* of fame , by not *allowing* ego to take over
