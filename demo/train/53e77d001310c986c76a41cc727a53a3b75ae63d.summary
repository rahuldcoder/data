-- from humble feature phones to souped - up tablets , mobile devices have become a major player in @entity6 's media landscape			1
new research from @entity8 shows that nearly half of all @entity6 now access some kind of mobile media : browsing the mobile web , using mobile apps or downloading content via a mobile device			1
furthermore , mobile users increasingly own multiple mobile devices that they use in various ways over the course of a day or simultaneously , making them what @entity8 calls " digital omnivores			1
" " not too long ago , consumers depended solely on their desktop computer or laptop to connect online , " the report says			2
" now , a growing number of consumers are likely to access a wide variety of digital content across a multitude of devices on a daily basis			1
" with smartphones , tablets and other connected devices , consumers have become digital omnivores -- not just because of the media they consume but also in how they consume it			1
cross-platform consumption has created a vastly different digital landscape , and it is one that requires insight into both the individual usage of devices as well as the nature of their complementary use			1
" digital omnivore ? guilty as charged			2
here 's how this works in my life : on a typical workday , while i 'm making my morning tea , i 'm also downloading that day 's audio podcasts to my computer			1
i sync these up with my @entity61 so i can listen to the news while i make breakfast and hit the gym			0
while i 'm walking to the gym , a podcast news story captures my interest			0
i stop on the sidewalk for a minute , pull out my @entity70 phone and do a @entity72 search to find the version of that story on the podcast 's website			2
i scan the first few paragraphs and realize i 'll want to read the story later in - depth			0
so from my phone , i share that story to my @entity81 account ( a free service that saves and delivers long - format text content in a format easy to read on a variety of mobile devices )			1
later that afternoon , on my lunch break , i pull out my kindle and sync it via wi - fi to my @entity91 account			0
the @entity88 downloads my latest @entity81 archive : a few articles i 've recently saved , including the article from that morning			0
i read these while having lunch			0
one story in that @entity81 batch mentions a new film that sounds interesting , a remake of " @entity101			0
" so i pull out my phone , launch the @entity103 app and watch the trailer			0
i like it so much , i tweet about it and post it to a group of friends on @entity110 , all from my phone			0
by then , i 've finished my soup , and it 's time to get back to work			2
notice that i have n't turned on a tv or radio or opened a printed newspaper or magazine at all that day			0
that 's normal for me			2
still , i 'm accessing comparable ( and arguably more useful , flexible and actionable ) kinds of content via devices that i can easily carry around anywhere i go			2
also : no trees were harmed in the making of this content experience			2
i do n't personally own a tablet ( i have n't found one that suits my needs at a price i 'm willing to pay ) , but according to @entity8 , the emergence of tablets is making the media landscape ever richer and more complex -- and more fragmented			1
while tablets are still a very small part of the mobile market , @entity8 says three out of five tablet users get some kind of news on this device , and 25 % do so daily or most days			1
as a journalist , i take that as potential good news -- in the long run			0
but for now , even though half of @entity6 are already accessing some kind of mobile content , this contingent is still a long , long way from taking over digital media as a whole			1
the @entity8 report notes , " the share of non-computer traffic for the @entity6 stood at 6.8 % in august 2011 , with two - thirds of that traffic coming from mobile phones and tablets accounting for much of the remainder			1
" this traffic measurement includes only browser - based page views -- just a subset of all internet traffic ( which encompasses everything from e-mail to app support to streaming video to cloud computing and storage )			0
but still , 6.8 % is a soberingly small figure , considering how much media attention mobile technology is getting			1
in the big picture , for now , digital media still exist mainly in the realm of computers that rely on wired broadband connections			2
but this is changing fast : @entity178 recently predicted that by 2015 , more @entity6 will access the internet via wireless connections ( wi - fi and wireless carriers ) than " wireline " connections ( cable modem , dsl , etc. )			1
where is this trend heading ? among its conclusions , @entity8 notes , " devices influence the way people consume content and it is important to remember that they do not exist in isolation of one another , but have a complementary relationship in consumers ' lives			1
" in other words , it 's a bit like drug interactions : different media and communication devices affect us in different ways , especially in combination			1
for instance , i would have gotten less value from the news podcast on my @entity61 if i had n't had my @entity70 phone handy while i was listening -- and less value still if i had n't been able to read the article i 'd encountered that way on my @entity88 , when and where that experience was more convenient			0
( and note that this total benefit did not hinge on me committing solely to any single platform or manufacturer			0
) in the coming year , i 'd expect to see more online publishers , advertisers and service providers experimenting with multichannel cross-platform offerings that support complementary types of engagement through your various ( and mostly mobile ) devices			1
similarly , activists , organizations and communities of all types will develop their own multichannel strategies , both intentionally and organically			0
we 'll probably see some strange bedfellows and blatant missteps along the way			0
but the ultimate goal will be to create a more coherent yet customized experience that feels ambient , not tied to specific devices			2
which is probably good , since this technology keeps changing so fast			0
