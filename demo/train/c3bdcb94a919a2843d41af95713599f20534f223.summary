-- with its launch of @entity3 09 , @entity1 has begun showing some reasons why it 's worth enduring the hassle of geotagging your photos			1
@entity9 , @entity1 's senior vice president , unveils @entity3 09 at @entity10 tuesday			1
it 's generally not easy right now to label your photos with information about where you took the pictures -- the process usually is done with special software to marry the photos with location data taken from a separate gps receiver			1
@entity9 , @entity1 's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing , demonstrated what you can do with @entity3 at the @entity10 2009 keynote tuesday			1
@entity3 09 works best with photos that already have been tagged			1
that 's getting more common , as gps hardware support becomes less of a rarity			1
for example , @entity31 's @entity30 has a built - in gps receiver , and @entity31 has begun selling its gp - 1 gps receiver , which can plug into its @entity36 's flash mount so location data is embedded in the photo			1
@entity1 's @entity39 can geotag its own photos , and camera manufacturers say gps support in cameras has become a matter of when , not if			1
but the software also can help you tag your own images			1
clicking a photo flips it over , letting you type in a location , then showing the spot using a map			2
( @entity52 supplies back - end mapping services )			0
helpfully , @entity3 then can spread that location data to other photos with similar time stamps , and they can be bundled together into a group called an event			1
ok , but what can you do ? once you have geotagged photos , what can you do with them ? for one thing , sift through them geographically using @entity66 ' new places interface			2
viewing an @entity3 event can show an associated collection of pushpins on a map , and clicking each pin shows the photo			0
for another , you can search for photos based on where you took them , not on whatever filing system you might use			1
@entity3 can handle geographic hierarchies , so if you labeled a photo with " @entity81 , " it 'll find it with a search for " @entity83 " or " @entity84			2
" @entity85 , you can create photo books based on location			1
for people who want to create albums of their travels , this is a good idea , especially since you can use the tags both for selecting photos to print and to add maps into the book itself			2
there 's no support for the painful part of geotagging , though : extracting location data from a gps unit			1
there are other programs that can handle that chore , including @entity107 's @entity106 , @entity108 , or @entity109			2
@entity3 is bundled with @entity110 , along with other members of the @entity113 suite : @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117			0
people who have earlier versions can upgrade to @entity113 for $ 79			0
tag , you 're it in some glorious future , computers might be able to understand the content of your photos just by " looking " at them , letting them retrieve just what you want when you ask			2
but for now , it 's mostly up to you to add metadata , textual information such as titles , captions , star ratings , and geotags			2
if you want to find pictures of the @entity136 , you 'll have to know when you took them , what folder you tucked them into , or hope you labeled them with appropriate tags			0
@entity3 09 , like @entity52 's @entity142 , adds another major tagging automation feature , though : face recognition			2
the software finds faces , lets you put a name to them , then offers other views of what it judges to be the same person			1
after you 're done , you can view photos of a specific person			0
and if you 've tagged people in @entity157 , it 'll slurp up those tags through a synchronization process			0
@entity161 's @entity160 , which has extensive tagging and geotagging abilities , also benefits from this synchronization ability			1
so what 's the upshot here ? good news and bad news			0
the good news is that the world of digital photography is moving to a new organizational scheme , finally shedding the filing - cabinet metaphor of a hard drive 's file system or the shoebox full of prints			0
the new tag - based world is more flexible and approachable in several ways , and it is still fully compatible with the older methods			0
the bad news is that in order for it to work , you have to do a little more work getting the tags right in the first place			0
@entity188 , for one , think that it 's worthwhile			0
here 's an example why : my sister needed photos for an end - of - year letter , and because i am the de facto family photographer , she looked to my online shots			1
the way she found photos of her family members was simply by searching my photos by her family members ' names at @entity160			0
that 's far superior to clicking on every photo album for the year and seeing what 's within			0
