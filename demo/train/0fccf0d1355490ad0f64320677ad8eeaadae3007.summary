-- @entity1 believes a vegetable garden has the power to revolutionize a community			1
it 's the idea behind of @entity6 , the nonprofit organization @entity1 conceived when she was just 12 years old			1
it all started in 2008 when her father , @entity9 , won a trip to @entity12 at an auction			1
the father - daughter adventure began with a stay on a wild game reserve in @entity17			0
assuming it would be the only time he and his daughter would set foot in @entity12 , @entity9 wanted @entity1 to see more than the commercialized landscape of the reserve			1
" it was important , as she was turning 13 that year , for her to see that the world that she knew was not the entire world , " @entity9 says			2
so they drove through the foothills of the @entity29 , about 10 miles past where the tar road ended and into a remote @entity33 village , where they had arranged to stay with local family			2
confronting reality in @entity12 on the side of a hill overlooking a sparse but picturesque valley sit a few hundred round mud huts that comprise the village of @entity42			1
" the thatched roofs just looked so pretty up on this hillside but as you get closer and closer you start to see the condition that they 're in ... and as you get closer and closer you just see the poverty , " @entity9 says			2
when the @entity49 arrived they were greeted by their hosts , the three @entity52 sisters , and immediately went to work chopping wood and helping prepare dinner			0
" i was completely overwhelmed and i wanted to leave			0
that night i told my dad i just could n't take it and i wanted to leave and i was crying , " @entity1 says			1
but they chose to stay			0
the next day , while @entity9 was helping the caregivers from a local @entity61 plant potatoes , @entity1 stayed inside to play with the children			1
" it was exactly like playing with kids here because 2 - and 3 - year - olds do n't speak @entity66 well in the first place			0
they love the same things			0
they just want to play			0
they just want to have fun			0
they want to explore , " @entity1 says			1
" i just connected with these 2 - and 3 - year - old babies			0
" during their five - day stay , @entity9 and @entity1 attended a wedding , helped in the schools and worked side by side with women in the garden as they tilled the soil with old tree branches and metal scraps			1
" when it was time to leave , i cried again , but this time it was because i did n't want to leave			0
i wanted to be able to come back			0
i did n't want to leave and not know what happened to my friends and family there , " @entity1 says			1
while waiting for their flight home , @entity1 looked up at her father and with the bold naiveness of a preteen suggested they start a nonprofit to help the village and the children she had grown to love			1
" literally we were sitting in the airport about to come home , and we decided to name the nonprofit @entity6 , which was my nickname in the village , which means gift , " @entity1 says			1
" and we registered the domain name and called my mom and told her were doing this			0
" growing vegetables and hope the @entity49 have returned to @entity42 every year since , working to break the cycle of poverty by planting school and family gardens			1
" poverty starts with the fact that people just are n't healthy because they do n't have the right food to eat			2
nobody 's starving but they 're malnourished , " says @entity9			0
the soil is fertile in @entity42 , but many people can neither afford the supplies nor have the knowledge to cultivate the land			1
with the help of a local site manager and the @entity12 @entity130 , @entity6 provides fencing , seeds , tools and training to families and schools in the community			1
as of this planting season , @entity6 has helped start gardens at every @entity61 ¨ che , primary school and secondary school in @entity42			1
the organization has also helped create about 65 family gardens , and it wants to see that keep growing			0
" there is a cooperative that is being formed there from people who were early adopters of our family and school gardens and who have had success and have wanted to do more , " @entity9 says			0
the struggle for a sustainable food system in @entity42 is not unique			2
according to the @entity156 , the world has the ability to eliminate hunger yet nearly one in seven people suffers from undernourishment			2
on @entity162 , celebrated each year on october 16 , the @entity156 is highlighting the way cooperatives can help small farmers like those in @entity42 , calling them the " key to feeding the world			1
" " this theme was chosen to highlight the many concrete ways in which agricultural cooperatives and producer organizations help to provide food security , generate employment and lift people out of poverty , " says @entity156 director - general @entity168 in a statement			2
join the fight against hunger if you want to join the fight against hunger this @entity162 , there are many ways to get involved			2
volunteer your time or make a donation to help @entity186 provide fencing , seeds and know - how to the people of @entity42 , @entity12			1
the @entity1 family says their hope is that @entity193 will become completely self - sustaining and a model for other villages in @entity12			1
give a cow , a camel or a goat to a family in need through @entity202 's @entity201			0
@entity202 provides animals and training to families and communities worldwide , which gives them a reliable source of food and the potential for extra income			2
share a meal and start a conversation			0
@entity213 says one billion people go hungry not because of lack of food but a broken food system , so the organization is encouraging people to host a @entity220 and talk about ways to fix it starting at home			0
find conversation starters on the @entity213 website			0
watch a video and help the @entity227 feed children around the world			0
for every person who watches @entity233 's story and learns more about why the fight against hunger is important , a child will receive a school meal .			2
