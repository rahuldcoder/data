after a chaotic day that saw @entity3 pick a new prime minister only for the vote be declared invalid hours later , the volatile @entity1 country appears to have a new premier -- the fifth in more than two years			1
the @entity8 , @entity3 's transitional parliament , seemed to have selected a new prime minister on sunday , choosing businessman @entity10 during a lively legislative session that saw several rounds of voting			1
but almost as soon as @entity10 was sworn in , the deputy speaker declared the election invalid			2
on monday , the @entity8 confirmed @entity10 as @entity3 's new prime minister after approving his appointment			1
" @entity10 was appointed head of the transitional government , and asked to form his cabinet and present it to the @entity8 for a confidence vote within 15 days , " said a decision signed by @entity8 speaker @entity19			1
" this decision is in effect from date of publication ... and anything that contradicts it is nullified and all those concerned must implement it			0
" the resolution was numbered as " @entity31 " and dated may 4 but published monday			0
given sunday 's dispute , it was unclear what exactly would happen next			0
the appointment makes the 42 - year - old businessman @entity3 's fifth and youngest premier since dictator @entity38 was toppled and killed in a 2011 revolution			1
but the confusion was another blow to a transitional government that has struggled to impose its authority over myriad militia groups that have grown in power and influence since the @entity48 - backed uprising			1
@entity50 's work has been undermined by internal squabbling and threatened by the @entity1 country 's fractious militias , many of whom fought to oust @entity38 but have refused to lay down their arms			1
sunday 's vote was the latest in several attempts to choose a prime minister			1
another vote was abandoned last week when armed men stormed congressional headquarters , sending lawmakers fleeing			0
it took two rounds of voting before @entity10 emerged as the front - runner for the post on sunday , but he fell short of the 120 votes required in a confidence vote			2
a power struggle soon erupted in the assembly , with officials giving contradictory versions of the outcome			0
second deputy speaker @entity76 said @entity10 had clinched 121 votes after voting resumed			2
but first deputy speaker @entity79 , who had chaired the first vote , said it was illegal , as he had already declared the session over			0
both men could be seen arguing in the chamber on television			0
@entity86 took the role of acting speaker during sunday 's session			0
@entity19 , who usually chairs parliamentary sessions , disappeared from public view after the prosecutor general reportedly launched an investigation into a leaked video showing him being questioned over a late - night visit by two women to his house			0
the premier 's post became vacant after interim prime minister @entity100 resigned last month , citing an attack by gunmen on his family just a month into his term			1
he continued as caretaker premier until his successor was picked			0
he had taken over from @entity107 , who fled the country after he was ousted by deputies over his failure to stop attempts by rebels in the volatile east to sell oil independently of @entity116 's government			1
many @entity3 in the oil - producing nation blame political infighting for a lack of progress in @entity3 's fragile nascent democracy after more than 40 years of one - man rule			2
a new constitution is in the works -- a process that has been repeatedly delayed by political wrangling -- but many are increasingly frustrated with the lack of economic progress and deteriorating security			0
to appease the rising popular discontent , the @entity8 has agreed to hold early elections this year for a new legislature that would also produce a new government .			2

@entity10 confirmed by @entity8 as fifth prime minister since end of 2011 uprising
confirmation follows chaotic scenes in @entity50 on sunday
@entity116 government struggling to impose order in country awash with weapons
many @entity3 angry at slow democratic progress , *worsening* security
