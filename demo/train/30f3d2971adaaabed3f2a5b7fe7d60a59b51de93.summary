@entity0 -- the decommissioning of four reactors at the crippled @entity5 nuclear power plant will likely take more than 30 years to complete , according to a report by @entity8 officials			1
the draft report , released by @entity8 's @entity10 of the @entity11 on friday , said the removal of debris -- or nuclear fuel -- should begin by the end of 2021			1
" we set a goal to start taking out the debris within a 10 - year period , and it is estimated that it would take 30 years or more ( after the cold shutdown ) to finish decommissioning because the process at @entity5 would be complicated , " the report states			1
last month , the plant 's owner -- @entity26 -- said engineers might be able to complete the cold shutdown of damaged reactors by the end of the year			1
@entity31 , the director general of the @entity32 , told the @entity33 tuesday that operators of the plant " are now confident that the so - called cold shutdown will be achieved by the end of the year			1
" temperatures in the three reactors where meltdowns occurred in the wake of the historic march 11 earthquake and tsunami have already been brought down below 100 degrees @entity44 ( 212 degrees @entity45 ) , but the company has to maintain those conditions for some time before declaring the reactors in cold shutdown , @entity26 spokesman @entity37 said in october			1
experts have said it will take years -- perhaps decades -- to fully clean up the worst nuclear disaster since @entity53			2
hydrogen explosions blew apart the no. 1 and no. 3 reactor housings , while another hydrogen blast is suspected to have damaged the no. 2 reactor			0
fires believed caused by heat from the no. 4 spent fuel pool damaged that unit 's reactor building			2
the atomic energy commission 's report noted it took 10 years to remove nuclear fuel after the 1979 @entity69 disaster in the @entity70			1
the commission predicted removing fuel at @entity5 would require more time , because the extent of the damage was more severe			0
but the timetable does n't address plans for dealing with the radiation released into the wider environment from the @entity5 disaster , said @entity80 , a radiation ecologist at the @entity82			0
@entity80 told @entity84 's " @entity83 " on wednesday that scientists " are just now starting to get a handle " on the amount of radioactive material released by the disaster			0
" what 's important to realize is there 's a very large environmental problem that needs to be addressed head - on , " he said			1
" at the moment , there 's very little in the way of scientific research being done to determine what the scope and the time frame will be for dealing with the remediation of these effects in the coming years			0
" @entity80 said volunteers collecting data around the country are finding " quite a bit of radiation , " while contaminated water released into the @entity107 will take some time to be fully dispersed and diluted			0
the plume of radioactive particles that spewed from @entity5 displaced about 80,000 people who lived within a 20 - kilometer ( 12.5 - mile ) radius of the plant , as well as residents of one village as far as 40 kilometers to the northwest			0
the government has yet to determine when those evacuated can return to their homes			0
in mid-october , an @entity32 team praised the country 's efforts to decontaminate the area , but urged @entity8 authorities " to avoid over-conservatism " in the effort			2
@entity8 's main strategy has been to scrape off the top 5 centimeters ( 2 inches ) of topsoil from contaminated areas -- a plan the @entity32 found could produce " huge amounts of residual materials " -- but it is conducting a variety of tests in different areas , the report concluded			2
@entity1 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0
