-- an extensive internal review of the debacle at @entity3 that left a child sex abuser in place on campus for years forever casts a shadow over a heroic figure at the school : @entity10			1
the report , the result of months of investigation , finds @entity10 and a few other top officials not only showed a " callous and shocking disregard for child victims , " but also helped " empower " assistant football coach @entity15 to attract victims , according to former fbi director @entity17 , who spearheaded the review			1
review at @entity3 : ' total disgard ' for the victims allegations have swirled around @entity10 , the legendary head football coach who led @entity3 to national prominence , since the scandal broke last year			1
still , the official independent review deals a heavy blow to those who love college football and idolize @entity10			1
@entity3 trustee @entity30 , head of the committee addressing the @entity15 scandal , said it was clear that @entity10 and other key university leaders exhibited " inexcusable failures " when it came to protecting children			1
but , @entity30 said , figuring the coach 's legacy will be a bit more complicated			2
@entity10 defended @entity3 in letter before his death " there is a lot about his life that 's worth emulating , " he said			1
" you have to measure every human by the good they 've done , the bad they 've done			0
i do n't think any of us wants to be measured by the worst things we 've ever been done in our life			0
" following the report 's release thursday , many people took to social media to condemn the aura of support that has long surrounded @entity10 -- and the students who rioted in november after he was fired			1
" ' @entity10 ' participated in a cover - up to protect a child rapist and allowed it to continue , " @entity63 user @entity62 wrote thursday on @entity3 's @entity63 page			1
he added that " there 's a statue of him on campus			0
what on earth are people being taught at that university ? " but some people in @entity77 -- a small town that revolves largely around the big university -- insisted @entity10 , who died in january , has not been judged fairly			2
" i think from the very beginning , @entity10 was made a scapegoat , " said local resident @entity80			2
the football program itself , she added , " really had nothing to do with this			0
" reactions to review flood social media student @entity89 said he believes " there is some merit " to the idea that @entity10 has been scapegoated			1
but @entity89 praised the report , including what he described as its calls for changing the culture at @entity3			0
" it 's hard for a lot of people " at @entity3 to hear @entity10 's name " not used in the best of light , " he added			1
@entity104 , who played for @entity3 between 1991 and 1993 , told @entity0 shortly after the report came out that what he heard of it had not changed his opinion of the legendary coach , though he had not yet read it			2
" i think in fairness it needs to be read			0
it needs to be digested to be responded to , " @entity104 said			0
" i think the accusations are very direct , they are very clear , and it would be unwise to try to defend any wrongdoing			0
i just think there needs to be an opportunity to respond to those accusations			0
" weeks before his death , @entity10 himself wrote an op - ed that was never published			2
in it , he generally defended his actions and the university			0
at a glance : key players in @entity3 report " regardless of anyone 's opinion of my actions or the actions of the handful of administration officials in this matter , the fact is nothing alleged is an indictment of football , " he wrote			2
@entity17 , in his report , notes that @entity10 once told a reporter , " i did n't know exactly how to handle it and i was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was			1
so i backed away and turned it over to some other people , people i thought would have a little more expertise than i did			0
it did n't work out that way			0
" but " it is more reasonable to conclude " that he and former president @entity160 , former vice president @entity161 and former athletic director @entity162 , in order to avoid bad publicity , " repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to @entity15 's child abuse from the authorities , the board of trustees , @entity3 community , and the public at large , " @entity17 wrote in a statement accompanying the 267 - page review			1
evidence shows that @entity10 was made aware of a 1998 criminal investigation of @entity15 relating to suspected sexual misconduct with a young boy in a @entity3 football locker room shower , the report says			1
but @entity10 " failed to take any action , even though @entity15 had been a key member of his coaching staff for almost 30 years , and had an office just steps away from mr. @entity10 's			1
january : @entity10 remembered at public memorial " at the very least , mr. @entity10 could have alerted the entire football staff , in order to prevent @entity15 from bringing another child into the @entity181 , " where the incident took place			1
@entity10 and the others also failed to alert the board of trustees , @entity17 's statement says			1
" none of them even spoke to @entity15 about his conduct			2
in short , nothing was done and @entity15 was allowed to continue with impunity			2
" once , in february , 2001 , the four men decided they would report the incident to the @entity194 ; but @entity10 then had a conversation with @entity162 , and the men agreed not to do so , @entity17 wrote			1
after then - @entity3 graduate assistant @entity197 reported to @entity10 that he had seen what appeared to be a sexual attack involving @entity15 and a boy in a shower room in february 2001 , @entity10 responded to @entity197 , " you did what you had to do			1
it is my job now to figure out what we want to do , " according to @entity17 's report			1
" to his credit , mr. @entity10 stated on november 9 , 2011 , ' with the benefit of hindsight , i wish i had done more			2
@entity17 also said the team that carried out the investigation believes @entity10 would have spoken to them before he died , were it not for his declining health			1
the @entity10 family released a statement saying it was reviewing the report			1
" from the moment this crisis broke , @entity10 supported a comprehensive , fair investigation			2
he always believed , as we do , that the full truth should be uncovered			0
" despite scandal , @entity3 raises more than $ 200 million the probe found that @entity10 " reported what he was told about the 2001 incident to @entity3 authorities " -- meaning @entity162 , @entity231 , and @entity160 -- " and he believed it would be fully investigated , " the family wrote			1
" one great risk in this situation is a replaying of events from the last 15 years or so in a way that makes it look obvious what everyone must have known and should have done			0
the idea that any sane , responsible adult would knowingly cover up for a child predator is impossible to accept			0
the far more realistic conclusion is that many people did n't fully understand what was happening and underestimated or misinterpreted events			0
@entity15 was a great deceiver			2
he fooled everyone -- law enforcement , his family , coaches , players , neighbors , @entity255 officials , and everyone at @entity257 , " the charity program for children that @entity15 ran			1
@entity15 was convicted in june of sexually abusing young boys over a 15 - year period			2
" @entity10 was n't perfect , " the family statement said			1
" he made mistakes and he regretted them			0
" but if he " had understood what @entity15 was , a fear of bad publicity would not have factored into his actions			2
" the family statement acknowledged , " it can be argued that @entity10 should have gone further , " but it deflected blame from him , saying @entity10 assumed others were " doing their jobs			2
" @entity274 : mourning @entity10 , a flawed hero the @entity277 , which inducted @entity10 in 2007 , says in his biography , " no coach has been as synonymous with one school as has @entity3 's @entity10			1
" he was a five - time national coach of the year			0
" more important than all of the wins and titles he has accumulated may be his legacy with the influence he has had on his players , @entity281 and alumni			0
@entity10 has generously contributed millions to the school and its academic programs			0
the @entity290 has honored him with the @entity291 in 1992 and the @entity292 in 2006			0
" the organization did not immediately respond to request for comment thursday from @entity0			0
@entity295 , a @entity3 student who has sat in the first row for every @entity3 football game throughout his entire college career , cautioned against letting the scandal , and specifically the damage to @entity10 's reputation , cast a pall over the entire university			1
" i received my diploma in may , and it says ' the @entity255 , ' not ' @entity305 , ' " he said			0
" the university is not defined by one name or the actions of a few			0
" @entity310 , chairwoman of the board of trustees , said the question of whether the university should honor @entity10 " is a very sensitive topic			0
" " we believe that with the report 's findings , this is something that will need to continue to be discussed within the entire university community , " she said			0
@entity3 community still admires @entity10 , wants to move forward			0

@entity17 review finds @entity10 and others showed " shocking disregard " for victims
some students say the legendary head football coach has been scapegoated
@entity10 's family says he must not have understood what @entity15 was doing
this is not " @entity305 , " a new graduate and avid football *fan* says
