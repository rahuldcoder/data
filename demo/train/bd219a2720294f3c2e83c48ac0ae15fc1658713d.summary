-- if you have been an @entity2 stockholder last year , you probably feel like you have been on a roller coaster			1
@entity2 began 2012 by attaining the largest market cap in the world , with some analysts predicting that it would cross a trillion in market value			2
the stock price hit $ 700 in september , around the introduction of the @entity11			1
but in the weeks after , disillusionment set in and the stock price dropped to about $ 500 by the end of the year			1
recent earnings disappointment has plunged the stock some 12 % , and panic seems to have set in			1
how can a company fall from grace so quickly , especially when it still possesses enviable profit margins and perhaps the most valuable franchise in the world ? the answer lies in recognizing that a market price is set by demand and supply , which , in turn , are driven not only by underlying value but also by other factors including hope , hype and momentum			1
@entity2 is particularly susceptible to these " nonvalue " forces			2
@entity2 has acquired a motley collection of investors , with wildly divergent views about the company and its future			1
there are growth investors , who were attracted by its capacity to come up with new products and conquer new markets			0
there are momentum investors , who were drawn by the ever - rising stock price ( at least a year ago )			1
and there are value investors , who were enticed by its capacity to generate and pay out large cash flows			0
the ubiquitous presence of @entity2 products has made each of these types of investors an expert on the company 's future			1
thus , investors who would not have dared forecast the futures of @entity64 and @entity65 -- when they were the largest market cap companies in the world -- feel no qualms about prognosticating @entity2 's future			1
you may wonder : so what ? when a stock becomes a pricing play , investors no longer pay attention to underlying value and instead focus on trivial stories , such as the lack of crowds at the @entity81 store for the introduction of the @entity11			1
investors react in exaggerated ( and herd - like ) fashion to small , often insignificant surprises			0
given that you and i as investors can do little about the crowd insanity that characterizes @entity2 's stock today , what should we do ? you can try to play the pricing game and get ahead of momentum shifts , a dangerous game that i , for one , have neither the stomach nor the expertise to play			1
alternatively , you can look past the price at @entity2 's underlying value , based on its capacity to generate growth and margins over time			1
at the end of last year , i estimated a value of roughly $ 609 per share for the company			0
while this valuation predates the most recent earnings report , i see little reason to revisit it , since the revenue growth and margins that @entity2 reported are actually in line with what i had used in my valuation			2
if you do decide to buy @entity2 's stock , as i did last week , remember that the pricing game has its own internal dynamics that may cause the price to move further away from value , before there is a correction			1
so , it is entirely possible that your " value play " in @entity2 could yield disappointments in the near term			2
to be successful , you have to be able to hold the stock through these disappointments and to stop listening to equity research analysts and @entity2 experts in the meantime			2
as for the company , it is time for a reboot			0
i feel sympathy for ceo @entity133 , who has big shoes to fill			0
but there are three things that @entity2 can do to put itself back on even keel			0
first , the company has to regain credibility with investors , both in terms of guidance that it provides on upcoming earnings and the information it makes available about its product plans			0
@entity2 has acquired a reputation for lowballing its expected results before earnings reports			2
instead of making it easier for the company to beat expectations , it has led instead to markets paying little heed to the guidance			0
also , @entity2 's secrecy about new products and strategies might be a great marketing strategy , but it creates an information vacuum , which is filled with rumors and fantasy			1
second , the company has to stop trying to be all things to all investors and make its stand on whether it sees itself more as a growth company or a more mature company			0
by making the choice to be a mature company , @entity2 is not forsaking growth , but it is signaling that its emphasis will be on protecting the profitability of its current franchises first before seeking out new growth opportunities			2
by doing so , it may be able to create a more homogeneous investor base that is less likely to be at war with itself			0
third , once @entity2 makes its stand as a growth or mature company , it has to behave consistently			2
so if it decides that it is a mature company , it should return more cash to its stockholders			0
the tax code is tilted toward debt , and a company that can afford to borrow money that does not is not using that tax benefit			0
so perhaps in the future , the company should think about using a little debt to fund itself			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

despite record *quarterly* profit , @entity2 's stock price plunged 12 % recently
@entity198 : how can a valuable company fall from grace so quickly ?
he says @entity2 has acquired investors with wildly divergent views about the company
@entity198 : when a stock becomes a pricing play , investors look past real value
