@entity0 -- @entity4 who are in " circumstances of extreme necessity " and are unable to pay their mortgages will not be evicted from their homes over the next two years , the main industry group for @entity4 banks said monday			1
the pledge comes just three days after a 53 - year - old woman committed suicide as authorities were preparing to foreclose on her home			2
it was the second such incident since late october			0
the move will not halt all home evictions during the ongoing economic crisis , but the @entity18 issued a statement saying that " due to social alarm generated by the home evictions , " it agreed with a government proposal made last thursday to halt foreclosures " during the next two years , in those cases where there are circumstances of extreme necessity			0
" in the incident last friday , the woman jumped to her death from her home in northern @entity4 as authorities were climbing the steps to evict her			1
the victim was a former @entity32 town councilor			0
her death followed the suicide last october 25 by a 53 - year - old man who hanged himself at a home in southern @entity4 shortly before the eviction team -- judicial and bank representatives , backed by police -- showed up			1
there have been protests for months in @entity4 over evictions as the nation suffers a recession and an unemployment rate just over 25 percent			1
but the two suicides sharply increased pressure on @entity4 authorities to take action			1
@entity4 's central judicial authority has reported than 150,000 evictions of @entity4 and immigrants from their homes since 2008 , when the crisis started , for falling behind on their mortgage payments			1
@entity4 's @entity56 newspaper reports the figure could be closer to 400,000			2
on monday , a spokesman for the deputy prime minister told @entity1 it was not immediately clear how many evictions would be stopped under the banking industry 's standard of " circumstances of extreme necessity " but he said it could be " some thousands			1
" housing advocates say hundreds of evictions are scheduled every business day			0
the banking association says 97 % of homeowners are still paying their mortgages on time			1
just hours after the second suicide last friday , prime minister @entity75 told a regional election rally that the government " will protect the most vulnerable families affected by evictions			0
" leading judges -- the judiciary is charged with carrying out the evictions -- have in recent days called on lawmakers to urgently address the problem			0
and a main police union , known by its letters @entity88 , offered to pay legal fees and lost wages for officers who decline to participate in evictions			2
the conservative government and the main opposition @entity95 -- after months of being unable to agree on almost anything -- have suddenly pledged to work together to ease the foreclosures			0
a senior @entity98 official and his counterpart from the @entity95 were to meet later monday to discuss other measures to ease the eviction crisis			0
credit was cheap in @entity4 during the boom years , when hundreds of thousands of new homes were built and it seemed that everyone could become a homeowner			2
the boom went bust in 2008 , and banks incurred huge debts from bad real estate loans while the economy slowed , the jobless rate increased , and consumer spending stalled			0
there have been widespread protests against the evictions and especially against the @entity4 law that lets banks seize not only the property but also go after debtors ' future income until everything has been paid back			1
at numerous evictions , authorities have been met by dozens of protesters who have organized to provide support for families facing evictions across the country .			0
