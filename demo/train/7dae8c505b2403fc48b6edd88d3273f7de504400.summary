@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 war may be over , but rivalries rage on among some regional militias , leading to a mutual distrust that poses a challenge to the new leadership			1
earlier this week , the rivalry was evident when dozens of fighters clashed at a @entity0 hospital in what residents said was the biggest armed confrontation in the capital in weeks			1
clashes erupted at 2 a.m. monday when a half dozen former rebels from @entity18 in the western mountains stormed the hospital , according to doctors			1
some of the former rebels were drunk , and demanded staff hand over a wounded fighter shot earlier that day , according to the doctors , who spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons			0
the patient and the body of a dead fighter had been taken to the hospital earlier , the doctors said , and the former rebels wanted to kill the wounded man			2
hospital staff declined to hand over the patient , who was undergoing surgery			2
@entity0 fighters in charge of hospital security forced them out , but not before the returning fighters shot rounds in the hospital			1
both groups called for backup , which arrived as fighting raged around the hospital grounds until 5 a.m. @entity49 said both sides were using heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns			1
walls near a hospital entrance were riddled with bullets holes , and nearby glass doors and windows were shattered			2
across the street , bullets pierced through the walls of two buildings			0
there were no deaths from gunshots , but medical staff said three patients died of stress - related causes that they linked to the fighting			0
at least three of the @entity0 fighters were wounded in the clashes , according to @entity73 , who is in charge of hospital security			1
he described it as the most serious incident of infighting so far			0
accounts differed over how the three - hour battle concluded , but at least three witnesses said it ended after calls from a local imam and senior commanders from both groups talked by phone with their men			2
@entity0 fighters said tuesday they are concerned about the rising tensions among the various groups , which are increasingly divided along regional allegiances			1
" we are concerned , as you can see , every day there is fighting between the rebels , this is something we do n't want , we want a united @entity1 , " said fighter @entity91			2
the scene on @entity0 's streets these days -- heavily armed men brandishing guns and racing across the city with no central command and little or no accountability -- has raised concerns among residents			1
" there are no security forces , everyone is running their own group , their own brigade , and they all control @entity0 , " said @entity0 militia member @entity106 , who did not provide a second name			1
