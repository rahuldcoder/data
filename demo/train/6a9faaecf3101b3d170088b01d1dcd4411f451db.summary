-- @entity2 officials have asked the @entity4 @entity3 to block -- at least temporarily -- same - sex marriage from moving ahead in the state			1
a resolution could come as early as friday			0
a federal judge there last week had ordered gay and lesbian couples be allowed to apply for marriage licenses and to wed after a normal three - day waiting period			1
but everything is now on hold until the justices issue an order			0
if the state loses at the high court , same - sex marriage could begin at 11 a.m. local time friday			1
@entity2 's @entity22 said " the state can not issue any marriage licenses until the stay is lifted			2
" some couples had begun applying for marriage licenses as early as monday and in at least some cases , couples were married when they were granted an expedited consideration			0
the state then asked for a stay , saying it needs more time to file more detailed appeals to show its sovereign power to define marriage is being usurped by the courts			2
officials , including the governor said waiting until the broader legal questions are resolved is best for all @entity2			0
" without a stay , the interim licensing of marriages contrary to @entity2 law could easily lead to administrative chaos that will harm everyone 's interest in the orderly enforcement of domestic relations laws , " said the state 's high court appeal			0
but a number of same - sex couples cited a federal appeals court ruling last week that struck down bans in @entity56 and @entity57 as unconstitutional			1
that appeals court 's legal jurisdiction includes @entity2 and other @entity61 states			1
the high court case is @entity63 v. @entity64 ( @entity65 ) .			0

@entity2 asked @entity3 to block same - sex marriage for now
