-- @entity2 delegates got an unusual reprieve at the @entity4 on wednesday when the @entity6 president offered them no reason to get up and walk out , a move that has become a bit of tradition for western delegations			0
@entity12 has a history of controversial statements , but in his eighth and final appearance in front of the assembly 's iconic green marble podium his tone seemed to shift from blustery to almost conciliatory			1
he said @entity6 was committed to peace , though he also accused world powers of double standards in pursuing an arms race			0
@entity12 then told delegates that @entity6 has a " global vision and welcomes any effort intended to provide and promote peace , stability and tranquility " in the world			1
@entity31 not persuaded by @entity6 on nuclear weapons the world is at a " historic juncture " now that @entity36 systems are virtually gone and " capitalism is bogged down in a self - made quagmire , " he said , which could allow for other nations to " play a more active role " in global decision making			0
however , the seats set aside for the @entity45 delegation were empty as he spoke			1
the @entity47 delegation also did not attend the speech , and @entity50 's representatives were absent in observance of @entity52			1
" over the past couple of days , we 've seen mr. @entity12 once again use his trip to the @entity4 not to address the legitimate aspirations of the @entity6 people , but to instead spout paranoid theories and repulsive slurs against @entity50 , " said @entity53 , a spokeswoman for the @entity54 to the @entity4			1
earlier this week , the @entity6 leader stoked controversy at the session when he declared that @entity50 has " no roots " in the @entity66			1
but on wednesday he offered a more subdued discourse , after being widely expected to serve up a rebuttal to a series of sharp jabs from @entity72 leaders , who accused him of fostering instability in the region by backing international militants , supporting @entity78 's embattled president and forging ahead with its nuclear program			2
though @entity6 says its program is for peaceful purposes , @entity72 leaders believe @entity83 wants to build a nuclear weapon			0
@entity4 inspectors have also expressed doubts about the program 's aims			2
@entity6 's president talks @entity50 , slams homosexuality still , @entity12 managed to draw @entity45 ire with generalized comments about its election spending as well as with comments about inequality of @entity4 leadership			1
he also told delegates that the body should be restructured , noting that many global issues are the result of poor management , and that " self - proclaimed centers of power ... have entrusted themselves to the devil			0
" an " arms race and intimidation by nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction by the hegemonic powers have become prevalent , " he added , noting that @entity6 has now found itself under threat			0
" continued threat by the uncivilized @entity113 to resort to military action against our great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality , " he said			0
" a state of mistrust has cast its shadow on the international relations , while there is no trusted or just authority to help resolve world conflicts			0
" though @entity12 's speech was not as provocative as some had predicted , his presence in @entity127 nonetheless drew demonstrations outside the @entity4 , with @entity132 's former mayor @entity131 among the speakers			1
" i 'm here to oppose @entity12 and ( @entity78 president ) @entity137 , " said @entity134 , an 18 - year - old protester from @entity135			1
" i lost a friend last week , and he was killed by @entity137 's regime with @entity12 's weapons			1
" president @entity141 , who 's campaigning for re-election , blasted the @entity6 president the previous day , suggesting that @entity6 and @entity78 are on the losing end of a sweeping tide of democracy in the region			2
a viewer 's guide to the assembly the @entity45 " will do what we must to prevent @entity6 from obtaining a nuclear weapon , " @entity141 said tuesday , reminding other leaders in attendance that a " nuclear - armed @entity6 is not a challenge that can be contained			1
" world leaders this week continue to discuss a range of issues , including poverty , global warming , women 's empowerment and the prospect of renewed conflicts in @entity164			2
but @entity78 's 18 - month civil war and renewed violence in the @entity66 and @entity167 are expected to continue to dominate the session			1
@entity170 prime minister @entity169 joined the chorus of voices at the @entity4 wednesday who oppose turning a " deaf ear to the voices of suffering " in @entity78			1
a range of other global issues were also raised over the course of the day			0
@entity180 prime minister @entity179 made an indirect reference to his country 's ongoing territorial disputes , which include a tense standoff with @entity185 over a set of islands in the @entity188			1
states have a responsibility to guarantee peace , ensure the safety of their people and protect their sovereignty on land and at sea , @entity179 said in his speech to the assembly			1
@entity180 will " fulfill such responsibility in accordance with international law , " he said , calling for greater adherence to the " rule of law " by other nations			2
@entity179 noted that there are " a number of territorial and maritime disputes in many parts of the world			2
" his speech did n't specifically mention @entity213 's island quarrel with @entity214 , which has provoked violent @entity216 protests in @entity185 and soured diplomatic and economic ties between the two nations			2
meanwhile , @entity4 @entity219 ban ki - moon sought to keep world attention focused on the worsening crisis in @entity167 's @entity222 , which has been plagued by a deadly mix of drought , famine and @entity227 militancy			2
" the @entity222 is at a critical juncture , " he said tuesday			0
" political turmoil , extreme climatic conditions and fragile economies are combining to create a perfect storm of vulnerability			0
" " the people and governments of the region need urgent international support , " he added			0
@entity239 's prime minister said wednesday at the @entity4 that his country has requested the adoption of a @entity243 resolution authorizing military force to help retake the northern part of his country			1
following a military coup in the capital in march , @entity227 seized control of roughly two - thirds of the @entity253 - sized nation			0
@entity239 , seen as a stable democracy and an example for other less stable countries in the region , was thrown into chaos			0
@entity141 stresses use of diplomacy , humanity during speeches in @entity263 earlier wednesday , @entity265 president @entity264 took the podium , reaffirming his nation 's commitment to the fight against @entity227 militants			2
but he also offered to talk with extremist groups , including @entity272 , provided they put down their weapons and repent			0
president @entity275 of @entity276 also addressed the assembly wednesday , marking what is regarded as an important foreign policy speech for a nation still reeling from the effects of a popular revolution that brought down @entity283 , a longtime @entity45 ally			1
@entity275 used the opportunity to draw attention to the issue of @entity288 statehood , calling for " measures to put an end to colonization , occupation , settlement and the alteration in the identity of occupied @entity296			0
" he also sought to contextualize recent violence in the region after an anti-islam film spawned protests and attacks against @entity45 diplomatic facilities across the @entity66 and @entity167			1
@entity276 will work to strengthen " mutual understanding between @entity227 countries and the rest of the world , " he said , and get rid of the " causes of misunderstanding used by fanatics on both sides to wrongly prove that differences between us are great			0
" five big issues at the @entity4 @entity0 's @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317 contributed to this report .			0
