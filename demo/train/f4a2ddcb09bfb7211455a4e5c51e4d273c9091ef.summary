-- it 's one thing not to boast about your $ 100,000 yacht			2
it 's another to be so rich , you actually forget you own one			2
for two years , the 10 - meter - long @entity8 boat floated in a @entity10 marina , its owner nowhere to be seen			1
the keys were tied to railing on the deck for all to see , adding to the mystery of the abandoned boat in the village of @entity16 , on the south @entity18 border			1
" you could just get on board and start it			0
but no , no one did , " said the area 's police inspector @entity22 , on what 's got to be one of the world 's most honest towns			0
as unpaid mooring costs mounted up , fears began to grow that something terrible had happened to the owner , whom no one had ever seen			2
inside the cabin were @entity18 documents dating back to 2008 , one of the few clues police had to the missing sailor			1
they launched a @entity41 appeal , which was picked up by the @entity18 press			1
eventually , their mysterious @entity18 owner came forward			1
it seemed the boat had simply slipped his mind			0
" he had forgotten about it , " said inspector @entity22 , who declined to disclose the owner 's name			0
" i think he must be really rich to forget he owned a boat like this			1
" " he was surprised -- he thought he 'd sold it years ago			1
" despite being unmaintained for two years , the swish yacht was in good condition			0
the owner 's biggest concern will now be paying the mooring fees			0
" as a guest to the harbor you usually pay a fee of $ 30 to $ 50 per 24 hours , during summer , " said inspector @entity22			2
" but i do n't think he 'll have any problem paying it			0
" see : stupid stunt ? sailor walks the mast			0
