@entity0 , @entity1 -- for the @entity4 , life centers on the silver waters just off their reservation			1
throughout the tiny @entity9 's history they have lived and fished on the westernmost point of @entity1 where the river that shares their name meets the @entity14			1
according to the tribe 's legends , the @entity4 were created on the river by @entity18 or the " changer " in what the tribe refers to as the " @entity22			1
" in @entity4 lore the tribe were " upside down people , " who walked on their hands and struggled to throw fishing nets with their feet			1
@entity18 , the legend goes , righted them and taught the tribe to live from fishing the river and ocean			1
those same waters now threaten the tribe 's future			2
for tribe member and treasurer @entity39 , the danger can be seen on the doorstep of her family 's home that has stood at the mouth of the river for nearly a century			2
@entity39 grew up there with 12 members of her family			0
now the home is a gutted wreck from repeated flooding			2
at first the waters took out the garage and the small building @entity39 's grandfather used to smoke fish			0
then the family had to flee upstairs			0
" we 'd see the waves and the logs coming , " @entity39 said standing in the musty ruin of the home			0
" we 'd stand out here on the porch , and my grandfather would get mad at us and tell us to come back into the house			0
" although the lowlands where her family lived were always prone to flooding , @entity39 said the water rises more often now			2
" it never used to be this bad , " she said			0
" the river 's changed			0
" @entity73 , the tribe 's fish and wildlife officer , is a constant presence on the river and sees the difference too			1
cruising up the river in his boat , @entity73 showed where heavy rains caused a landslide , where erosion changed the river 's bank and where , pointing to a stretch of water , a " big pasture used to be			0
" the flooding is no small problem for a tribe of just under 300 people who occupy a reservation only one square mile in size			1
several homes have been abandoned , other homes and the tribe 's community center wear permanent necklaces of sandbags to keep away floodwaters			1
there is little room for new buildings and even where there is it 's unlikely they could be put up -- more than 90 percent of the reservation is in the flood plain , according to tribal leadership			2
there are no clear culprits for the tribe 's woes			2
according to @entity117 , the @entity119 's lead strategist for climate change policy , the increased flooding could be due to a combination of factors including global warming , logging upriver and cyclical weather patterns that have brought heavy rains			2
according to a department study , the coast where the @entity4 live could see an additional rise from climate change in sea levels of as much as 3 feet over the next century			1
already , when the reservation floods , the water comes up with terrifying speed			0
baseball games have been interrupted , said @entity73			0
" we 'll be waist deep on the ball field			0
" last year , @entity73 decided to move away from the reservation			1
" i got two little kids , what if the river came up around them ? " to rescue the tribe 's future the @entity4 leadership decided to move most of the reservation to higher ground and purchased new land for the expansion			1
before they begin building homes though , the @entity4 are waiting for @entity147 to pass a bill that places 37 acres of national park land in a trust for the tribe			1
the tribe would not be able to develop that land , but the grant would mean that tribe members will continue to live on one piece of land and help the @entity4 obtain funding for new housing			1
according to a spokesman for rep. @entity160 , the @entity1 @entity161 who sponsored the bill , @entity147 is expected to vote on the measure by the end of the year			1
for tribal chairperson @entity167 , the move away from the water wo n't come soon enough			0
" we are ready to move , we are ready grow , " @entity168 said looking out at the coastline where a major fault line sits			0
tribal lore talks of an earthquake and giant wave that devastated the @entity176 coastline 400 years ago			0
" what would happen , " @entity168 asked , " if a tsunami comes while we are here ? "			0

@entity4 tribe of @entity1 weary of constant flooding
several homes have been abandoned , other *structures* have permanent sandbags
@entity187 will move most of reservation to higher ground , new land has been purchased
