-- not content to sit quietly at home eating their tofu cutlets , more and more vegetarians , it seems , are taking action , trying to get the carnivorous masses to change their ways			2
of course , the meat - free have been trying to win people over to their cause since the time of @entity13			0
but lately , activists are trying more in - your - face tactics			1
for @entity18 , author of " @entity19 , " the " in - your - face " part is quite literal			0
a former vegetarian who has publicly recanted , she was lecturing in @entity21 , @entity22 , last week , when three masked assailants shouted " go vegan ! " and lobbed chili pepper - laced pies at her			1
even in hard - core vegan circles -- which exclude using animal - based products for food , clothing , medicine or any other purpose -- such borderline - violent exploits are controversial			1
more common is the approach of folks like newly converted talk show host @entity35 , who has been sharing recipes for vegan nachos along with her philosophy			1
still , recipes only go so far			0
and , more to the point , they do n't get as much media attention			1
for many vegan and vegetarian activists , getting coverage is an art. @entity46 if you 've ever read about a particularly outrageous pro-vegetarian campaign , there 's a good chance that @entity46 was behind it			1
the folks at @entity46 seem to be firm believers in the idea that " all media attention is good media attention , " and the more shocking or ridiculous the stunt , the more media outlets will pick up the story			1
@entity46 was laughed at when it tried to rebrand fish as " sea kittens , " in hopes that the more cuddly name would make seafood a less appealing mealtime choice			1
it was criticized for the suggestion that recently deceased @entity65 should be buried with his company 's hot dog - shaped @entity66			0
after @entity69 celebrity chef @entity70 cooked up horse meat on his show , @entity46 @entity69 dumped a ton of manure outside his @entity76 restaurant			1
plenty of ecological activists cringe at these kinds of prankish maneuvers , but they do get noticed			2
and that , apparently , is the point			0
why else would @entity46 organize an army of zombies to protest outside of @entity87 restaurants ? not content to oppose meat - eating in the real world , @entity46 also took a swipe at virtual carnivorousness : in response to the @entity94 game " @entity93 , " the group released its own bloody version			1
and , as anyone who 's seen its anti-fur posters knows , @entity46 is well aware that sex sells			1
the group got the granddaughter of @entity102 revolutionary @entity101 to pose wearing nothing but a bandolier filled with carrots			0
last , year @entity46 proposed a too - racy - for - tv " vegetarians have better sex " @entity107 commercial , guaranteeing plenty of coverage when -- surprise ! -- @entity114 rejected the ad			1
@entity46 also brings its soft - core approach to the streets with its " @entity122 " campaign : young models , clad in a few strategically placed leaves , handing out veggie hot dogs			1
the group has enlisted @entity124 and @entity125 to pose for the @entity122 web site ( find it yourself ) -- probably the best thing that 's happened to their careers in years			0
is there tofu wresting ? yes , there is tofu wrestling			0
@entity135 @entity46 is not alone in combining feminine pulchritude and an anti-meat agenda			1
a couple of years back , @entity138 , @entity139 , resident @entity140 got a bunch of media attention when he opened @entity135 , the world 's first vegan strip club			1
serving veggie burgers with a side of nudity ( or maybe the other way around ) might seem to be just a publicity stunt			0
( the fact that @entity152 tried to put the club up for sale shortly after opening would seem to suggest that			2
) but mr. @entity140 is an earnest vegan himself , and he 's apparently retained ownership of @entity135 , though reviews -- of both the cuisine and the more fleshy attractions -- are decidedly mixed			2
@entity162 as the most public face of our carnivorous culture , @entity163 is a popular target of vegetarian activism			2
back in 1985 , the @entity76 branch of @entity170 declared october 16 @entity171 , and every year since , there have been protests and rallies all over the globe			0
the group @entity176 , founded by @entity178 students in 1993 , has come up with a gentler -- and tastier -- way to combat the ubiquity of the golden arches			0
with its help , you can host your own " @entity162 " event			0
there will be veggie burgers , there will be uniformed servers , and there will even be a costumed clown mascot -- @entity192 , " @entity194 's kinder brother			0
" the slogan : " billions and billions saved			0
" @entity196 even a green group like @entity198 is n't safe from vegan wrath			2
last year , the group hosted a comedy night at the @entity202 in @entity76 , only to have the event crashed by masked activists wearing enormous artificial testicles			2
they called themselves the " @entity196 , " and their crude slogan suggested that the middle - of - the - road members of @entity210 should grow a similar pair by supporting veganism			0
the @entity196 have not been heard from since their single appearance .			0

for many vegan and vegetarian activists , getting media attention is an art
@entity46 seems to firmly believe that " all media attention is good media attention "
manure dumping , zombies , vegan strip club have been used to further the anti-meat cause
