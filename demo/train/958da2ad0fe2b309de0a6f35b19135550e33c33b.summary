@entity0 -- @entity3 security forces halted @entity5 @entity4 -- joined by a @entity7 envoy -- participating a pre-easter procession saturday in @entity0 's @entity9 , an action the envoy sharply criticized but that an @entity3 official dismissed as a " non-event			1
" @entity14 , the @entity7 special coordinator for the @entity16 peace process , was among a large , tightly packed group trying to walk together on what is holy saturday on the @entity21 calendar			1
a woman yells out at one point , " they are preventing us from accessing our churches to pray			2
" some time later , the people are stopped by security forces			0
barricades are set up , only to be picked up and taken away			0
there 's also some pushing and shoving before the scene eventually calms down			0
the special coordinator 's office explained that the group had intended to move from the area 's @entity35 to the @entity37 " at the invitation of the @entity5 @entity21 community in @entity0			2
" it said the group had been earlier given " assurances ... of unhindered access , " only to have " the @entity3 police refuse ... to allow such entry claiming they had orders to that effect			1
" @entity14 expressed " dismay " over the incident , adding , " i call on all parties to respect the right of religious freedom , granting access to holy sites for worshippers of all faiths and refraining from provocations , not least during the religious holidays			1
" yet @entity3 's government saw the matter in a different light			2
@entity67 spokesman @entity65 -- in a message retweeted by @entity64 spokesman @entity63 -- said , " @entity7 envoy # @entity68 shows poor judgment in fabricating an incident out of a non-event , mishandling sensitive issue of religious freedom			1
" @entity74 told the @entity75 that police were acting to limit the number of those packed into the church and the narrow streets around it , dismissing what happened as " a micro-incident			2
" this incident is not @entity14 's first run - in with authorities : the @entity7 envoy said he was threatened by armed men in @entity89 , which broke away from @entity90 and joined @entity91			1
whatever its origins or conclusions , saturday 's ordeal did not prevent other activities in and around the @entity37 , which is where many @entity4 believe @entity96 was buried and rose from the dead			0
on saturday , the church once again was home to the @entity100 ceremony , including the sight of dozens of people holding candles or small torches			0
@entity1 's @entity105 reported from @entity0 ; @entity106 wrote and reported from @entity107			0
