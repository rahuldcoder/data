-- every remake is subjected to side - by - side comparisons and the criticism that comes along with them , but " @entity7 " is something of a special case			1
after its release in 1976 , the film became revered in some @entity11 households and beloved by audiences			1
the movie centered on the characters of @entity16 , @entity7 and @entity17 , three harlemites in the late 1950s who find the road to stardom is not at all paved in gold			1
written by @entity23 from a story conceived by @entity25 , and directed by @entity26 , to say it has achieved cult status is n't an understatement			2
the three sisters , each spirited in their own way , formed a singing group with help from two friends of theirs from the neighborhood and church choir : @entity38 , the aspiring songwriter who also had an insatiable love for @entity7 , and @entity41 , an up - and - coming hustler			1
the sisters ' ascent , however , has devastating ripple effects			2
screenwriter @entity46 , who penned the script for the 2012 remake and is also a co-producer , believes " @entity7 " owes its longevity to the heft of its story and the filmmakers ' attention to detail			1
" when you look at the original , especially in the context of when it was released and even throughout the years , the approach to these characters ' stories , they took them seriously , " @entity58 said			1
" they took their problems , their angst , their dreams , their hopes , their desires , their failures , seriously			2
they did n't have to tell jokes through it			2
that translates to the audience			2
" so when the film 's director , @entity80 , who is also her husband , pitched her the opportunity to revive " @entity7 's " tale , @entity58 admits she was a bit fearful of the wrath she might incur for tweaks made to the story 's original characterizations			1
but , she added , " it was the fear that led me to do it			2
" " i think anything that makes me feel that challenge , that 's exactly where i want to be , " @entity58 said			2
" it did give me pause , and @entity80 and i both were like , oh , heck no , we 're not doing this			2
but we were driving around talking about ' what if			2
' ... and it was like we were already hooked and wanting to take on that challenge			0
" take it on they did			0
for starters , @entity58 said , she and @entity46 wanted to give the three sisters at the heart of the story more power			1
" [ @entity80 ] wanted the women to be empowered			0
he thought in the original that they were a little victimized			1
that 's one of the core changes that he wanted to make , and if that was the case , then he wanted to have me write it because i 'd been writing about women in my work -- our empowerment , our vulnerabilities , our humanity and all those sorts of things , and he thought i 'd do a good job with that , " @entity58 said			0
once she moved past her initial trepidation , " @entity130 " and " @entity132 " creator was excited by the possibilities			0
the story is now set in @entity135 in 1968 , and rather than do a spin on the " rags - to - riches " concept the original explored , the family is now a part of a thriving black middle class			1
@entity58 said she and her husband , who led the charge for the new vision , re-imagined the film 's mother character as an entrepreneur rather than the housekeeper named @entity150 who actress @entity151 played in ' 76			0
in a role filled by the @entity153 , the new " @entity7 's " mother , @entity153 , is a former @entity155 singer whose mistakes and trials in the music industry led her to turn away from that world and embrace the church			1
@entity153 , now a dressmaker , also has the means to " provide a certain life , an aspirational @entity11 dream life , " @entity58 said , something @entity135 has exemplified			0
" it was hard being there knowing what a great city this was , " @entity58 added , " a great @entity11 city that was thriving because of the car industry , because of @entity174			0
it was n't foreign for a black person to live that			0
... it was very important for us [ to show that ]			0
" although this is a period film , @entity58 knew that this also needed to be a story for the modern woman			0
instead of simply being a singer , @entity7 is now a singer / songwriter who can draw comparisons to legend @entity187			1
the third sister , @entity17 , who in the original often gave voice to the racial injustices of the time , is now focused on a future in medicine			1
" the @entity196 character , i 'm very proud of this character and the changes i 've made			0
she got the best out of [ her mother ] @entity153 , " @entity58 said			0
" i think that @entity196 is now an aspiring doctor , and music is just something fun to do			0
" in addition to creating more empowered female characters and setting the story in a period filled with the hope for societal changes to come , it was also important to director @entity58 to re-cast the movie 's villain , @entity210			1
played by @entity213 in the original , the character was a violent yet alluring high - living hustler who had no qualms about physically assaulting or verbally debasing women			1
portrayed by @entity220 in the remake , the role of @entity219 is now " a bit of a commentary on how much do you sell yourself out to entertain , " @entity58 said			1
" we made sure the @entity219 character got all his riches making jokes off the black community and selling it to the white community , and he 's living a really wonderful life , but inside , he 's torn up , he 's insecure			0
and that energy has to come out somewhere , and unfortunately it comes out on sister in a domestic violence way			0
" what of @entity16 , the tough - talking scene - stealer who in the original had a persistent thirst for the riches in life ? " people love sister ; you ca n't mess with @entity16 too much , " @entity58 said with a laugh			1
" i certainly tried to answer what was motivating her , and what she was trying to do			0
" adding in these details , she added , " was a lot of fun for me , and i hope it translates to the audience			0
