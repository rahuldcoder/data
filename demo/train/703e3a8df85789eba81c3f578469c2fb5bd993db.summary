-- " the little sisters do incredible work in the world and this case ... has brought their work to light			0
" that 's @entity10 president @entity9 on @entity11 , discussing ( and disputing ) the lawsuit brought on behalf of @entity4 , a religiously affiliated , nonprofit charitable organization challenging the exemption procedures under @entity15 's contraception mandate			1
and @entity9 is right : the sisters , admirably , run nursing homes across the country			0
but the lawsuit brought in their name at the very least is , as @entity23 editorial board wrote , " an unjustified attempt by an employer to impose its religious views on workers " and at worst a wrongheaded co-optation of the notion of religious liberty			0
either way , it certainly fits with the ongoing conservative partisan agenda to unravel the @entity15 the @entity4 order , based in @entity35 , is already exempt from @entity15 's requirement that employer - provided health insurance plans cover the cost of contraception without a co-pay as part of ensuring comprehensive preventative health care for women			1
to claim that exemption , the @entity44 simply have to sign a short form stating their religious exemption to contraception			2
this is not about the nuns having to cover contraception			1
this is about a piece of paper			0
in essence , the plaintiffs in the case are arguing , as @entity59 of @entity60 has pointed out , that filling out a form is a violation of their religious freedom			0
sound a bit far - fetched ? indeed , that 's what a federal judge and two appellate courts have already ruled			2
and yet the case , and the ongoing conservative opposition to the contraception mandate , continues on			1
late last month , @entity73 @entity72 surprisingly gave the nuns a temporary reprieve , blocking the requirement until the merits of the case can be considered certainly conservatives are n't pursuing attacking the contraception mandate to win a popularity contest			1
data show that 98 % of sexually experienced @entity84 women of child - bearing age have used a method of contraception other than natural family planning at some point in their lives and that 82 % of @entity92 -- and 89 % of @entity93 overall -- say that contraception use is morally acceptable			1
even so , conservatives grasping for any threads to try and unravel health care reform turned their ire on this portion of the @entity15 but the administration has already amended the law to address the objections of religious conservatives -- mainly , it should be noted , @entity92 , as it was the @entity104 that helped lead the push against the contraception mandate			1
the @entity108 administration exempted all religious organizations , including churches , from the mandate			2
and the administration created the exemption for religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations that object to birth control			0
in signing a simple self - certifying waver , these nonprofits alert their insurance companies or third - party administrator to their objection , and that company then provides contraceptive coverage at no charge to women who work at the nonprofit			1
the @entity125 's counsel argue that signing the exemption form is still tacitly facilitating the provision of contraception through the nonprofit 's insurer			2
as @entity139 points out in the @entity140 , " the sisters ' insurer [ @entity132 ] is also exempt from the mandate , because the health plan is n't governed by @entity136 , the federal law under which the mandate is imposed			0
in other words , signing the form does n't lead to contraceptive services either			0
" so one ca n't help but wonder what 's really motivating the lawsuit			0
the @entity44 are being represented by a religiously affiliated legal group pushing a broader conservative agenda to dismantle @entity15			1
while the @entity151 has pursued a handful of bipartisan cases , the majority of its lawsuits hew to the agenda of the religious right			0
it 's an agenda to which the @entity151 is tied ideologically and financially , the monitoring organization @entity156 has noted			0
in addition to @entity92 - affiliated backers , the @entity151 enjoys major support from ideologically driven conservative foundations , such as the @entity162 , whose other grantees include the @entity165 and the @entity166 , partisan institutions leading the conservative fight against @entity15			1
note the @entity151 is also the source of the attorneys behind the @entity172 case in which a private corporation that willingly opts to receive special , favorable government treatment under that status is nonetheless alleging it should also qualify as a religious entity for purposes of exemption from the health care law 's contraception mandate			1
here 's the thing : no one is saying that the @entity4 should have to pay for contraception for their employees			1
there 's an exemption under @entity15			2
for which the nuns qualify			0
if only they would sign the form			0
in other words , the law already works for groups like the @entity44			0
they do n't want to fund contraception coverage and , under @entity15 , they do n't have to			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198			2

@entity198 : suit on behalf of @entity4 challenges contraception mandate
she says nuns ' suit *dovetails* with *unrelenting* conservative opposition to @entity15
she says @entity15 exempts nuns from contraceptive coverage mandate ; why sue ?
@entity198 : conservative lawyers for nuns have right - wing backers , using nuns to push agenda
