-- in late november , @entity2 soldiers were supervising artillery training for @entity5 troops in @entity6 , close to the @entity8 border			1
after they climbed a ridge to assess the impact area , an @entity5 border policeman suddenly turned on them and opened fire			1
seconds later , six @entity2 and their assailant were dead			0
it was one of the deadliest incidents of what the military call " green on blue " -- a euphemism for attacks by members of the @entity5 security forces on their allies in the international force known as @entity27			1
they have risen sharply over the past year , raising fears that the @entity30 are infiltrating the @entity31 and police force			1
but military analysts and intelligence officials say the reality is more complicated			1
the @entity30 said they had recruited the border policeman , but his real motive was never established , and it transpired that he 'd had an argument with his father over his choice of bride			1
in an even deadlier incident , an @entity5 air force officer shot dead eight @entity2 @entity46 personnel and a @entity2 contractor at @entity48 in march			2
but there is little to suggest he was a @entity30 infiltrator either			2
according to a @entity54 analysis seen by @entity0 , " green on blue " attacks have killed 52 @entity2 and allied soldiers since 2005 , many of them in the past year			2
the analysis concludes that combat stress provoked 36 % of the attacks , even if the @entity30 subsequently claimed responsibility			1
in 23 % cases , an @entity5 soldier had been persuaded by the @entity30 to carry out an attack -- but the motive in an additional 32 % of cases was unknown			1
a senior intelligence official involved in @entity54 's training program told @entity0 that " battlefield conditions and frequent deployments are the leading causes " of such incidents			0
" when you are in the mountains for months , you 've just had enough , " he said			0
the official said cultural differences over the handling of weapons and the attitude of western soldiers to @entity5 women can exacerbate tensions			2
coalition officers often reprimand their @entity5 colleagues for lax control of weaponry , and that can breed resentment			2
in late 2008 , an @entity5 soldier liked and relied upon by his @entity2 comrades in @entity91 suddenly turned his gun on them and shot two dead before fleeing			2
for the @entity30 , infiltration is a cheap tactic and one they boast about			2
beyond the incidents , it sows mistrust and apprehension on a wider scale among troops who should be cooperating			0
as the struggle against the @entity30 reaches its climax , military analysts say a growing " insider threat " could be disruptive			1
for example , after three @entity109 soldiers were shot dead by an @entity5 soldier this year , some of their comrades refused to go on patrol with their @entity5 counterparts , according to the magazine @entity114			0
earlier this month , lt. gen. @entity115 , the commander of the @entity54 training mission , admitted recent incidents " erode the hard - earned trust that is required for an effective partnership			0
" but the senior intelligence official told @entity0 that the insurgents ' efforts to infiltrate @entity5 security forces had not so far yielded much of a dividend and was n't anywhere near the top concerns facing @entity27			1
he pointed out that the 52 coalition deaths caused by @entity5 security personnel were a small percentage of nearly 2,000 " hostile fatalities " between 2005 and 2011			0
other estimates are higher -- but include killings by @entity5 contractors and incidents of " impersonation , " where an insurgent launches an attack disguised as a soldier or policeman			0
police and military uniforms are easy to come by in @entity5			1
in one incident this year , a soldier passed on a uniform and identification to a suicide bomber who attacked a military hospital in @entity48			0
one reason " green on blue " attacks have risen is because there 's more interaction between @entity2 and @entity5 soldiers as the latter take on more responsibility			1
there are about 290,000 @entity5 in uniform			0
the number of joint military patrols has increased drastically , exceeding 10,000 last year			0
among measures being taken to prevent such attacks , commanders are told to ensure @entity5 troops who 've been in combat are getting adequate rest ; and coalition officers are being taught to watch for warning signs			1
more @entity2 counter-intelligence officers are being deployed to @entity5 to help with screening recruits and reviewing the profiles of serving soldiers			0
the recruiting process now includes eight steps			0
a recruit 's application must be supported by two letters from community elders			0
gradually a nationwide database of @entity5 security forces is being compiled based on biometric information			1
some fifty @entity5 at the @entity182 , helped by the @entity183 , are populating the database			0
the objective is to screen out anyone with a criminal record or links to the insurgency			0
the process of vetting and biometrically enrolling the records of nearly 300,000 @entity5 security forces will be completed this year , according to a @entity54 training mission document compiled in february .			1
