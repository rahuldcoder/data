@entity0 -- it has long been the dream of many a liberal advocate : to have an unabashedly outspoken , cleverly articulate justice who can take on the conservative majority and inspire young progressives for decades to come -- a " @entity8 , " as many have called it			0
if confirmed , @entity11 may or may not turn out to be that intellectual counterweight to conservatives justice @entity14 or chief justice @entity15			1
but @entity11 displayed in her confirmation hearing tuesday what those two men share -- a ready public wit and disarming sense of humor			1
time and again , the nominee sought to subtly charm lawmakers on the @entity24 , many of whom tried to press her for candor on a range of contentious issues such as gun rights , executive power and military recruiting on campus			2
@entity11 's funny asides during 10 hours of questioning appeared spontaneous , and colleagues say that is her style : someone who is serious about the law but who enjoys a good laugh , often at her expense			1
sen. @entity44 , @entity45 , quizzed @entity11 on a favorite topic of his -- allowing cameras in the @entity48 , which most justices oppose			1
" it means i 'd have to get my hair done more often , sen. @entity44 , " @entity11 replied			1
the senator paused and appeared not to immediately get the joke			0
" let me commend you on that last comment and i say that seriously , " he said to laughter in the room			0
" you have shown a real admirable sense of humor and i think that 's really important			1
... we are looking for somebody who could moderate the court , and a little humor would do a lot of good			2
" when it comes to being funny , it helps to have a willing and ready partner			0
@entity11 found that in the folksy , clever phrasing of sen. @entity72 , @entity74 - @entity73 , who asked her about her 1995 statements criticizing past @entity48 confirmation hearings as a " vapid and hollow charade			1
" " let 's try to go back in time and say you 're watching these hearings and you were critical of the way the @entity24 conducted these hearings , " said @entity72 , drawing chuckles in the hearing room			1
" are we improving or going backwards ? and are you doing your part ? " " i think you 've been exercising your constitutional responsibilities extremely well , " @entity11 said , smiling broadly and drawing out the word " extremely			1
" " so , it 's all those other guys that suck , not us , right ? " responded @entity72 to huge laughs			1
on another occasion , @entity11 was left giggling by an exchange between sen. @entity98 , @entity99 , and committee chairman sen. @entity100 , @entity102			1
@entity98 had asked the nominee about a paper she wrote as a college student that took a critical look at how judges decide cases			0
" is it appropriate for judges to mold and steer the law ? " @entity98 asked			0
" all i can say about that paper is that it is dangerous to write papers about the law before you 've spent a day in law school , " @entity11 said			1
" i wrote that paper before i spent a day in law school			0
i was trying to think about whether to go to law school and i decided to write a paper about law in order to figure out whether i was interested in the subject ... so i would just ask you to recognize that i did n't know a whole lot of law			0
" her careful answer brought laughs , and @entity98 joked it caught him by surprise			0
" you know if i accept your answer , it is going to spoil a whole five minutes i had here , " @entity98 responded			0
" @entity98 , go ahead and accept it , " @entity100 cut in , to laughs			0
" let me enjoy it anyway , will you ? " a smiling @entity98 said			0
late in the day , conservative sen. @entity139 , @entity140 , said he would ask @entity11 a " softball " question			1
" promise ? " @entity11 replied , looking skeptical at first , and then grinning softly			2
the biggest laugh of the day came from another exchange between @entity11 and @entity72			1
the subject was the not so - funny topic of terrorism and the 2009 attempted @entity149 day bombing of a @entity151 - bound airliner			0
" the christmas day bomber , where were you at on christmas day ? " @entity72 asked			2
" sen. @entity72 , that is an undecided legal issue , which well , i suppose i should ask exactly what you mean by that , " @entity11 began			1
" i 'm assuming that the question you mean is whether a person who was apprehended in the @entity162 is ... " @entity72 interrupted , saying , " no , i just asked you where you were at on @entity149			2
" without hesitation , @entity11 replied in perfect deadpan , " you know , like all jews , i was probably in a @entity169 restaurant , " tossing her head and shrugging her shoulders in the process			2
sen. @entity174 , @entity176 - @entity175 , clapped his hands animatedly at the comment			0
to be fair , the members of the court usually labeled liberal -- justices @entity182 and @entity184 , and the retired @entity185 -- all display great legal minds but not much sharp - edged humor or the willingness to engage in spirited debate for which @entity11 is known			1
justice @entity190 is equally smart and he too shares a sense of humor , but that tends to fall on the quirky , self - deprecating side			2
on the conservative side , friends of justice @entity196 -- who almost never speaks at arguments -- note he has a great wit and a hearty laugh			0
colleagues call him the funniest justice you never hear about			0
if confirmed as expected , the 50 - year - old @entity11 could have years of humorous highlights ahead of her on the bench			1
with @entity15 , @entity14 , and @entity190 , she could help make the traditionally sober court a little more light - hearted			0
@entity174 paid @entity11 a high compliment tuesday , noting @entity14 gets the most laughs during high court oral arguments			2
" if you get there , and i believe you will , " @entity174 said , " you 're going to give him a run for his money			0

confirmation hearing displays @entity11 's sense of humor
nominee jokes that *televising* @entity48 *sessions* would force her to get her hair done more often
@entity11 and sen. @entity72 engage in humorous exchange
