@entity1 , @entity0 -- in a tough job market , @entity4 graduates seeking top - tier jobs are turning to a career networking site created by and catering to young professionals			1
@entity9 gets its name from the @entity11 for " reaching for talent			1
" @entity9 is an online community that seeks to match the brightest new grads with what it says are the @entity17 of positions in finance , consulting and tech. exclusivity is the cornerstone of this network , which connects graduates from elite schools with top employers			1
the site offers its members access to selective jobs that are not really available on the open market , according to founder @entity32			0
it 's able to do that because recruiting managers are drawn by the caliber of its members , which includes students from the top business schools , he says			1
schools like the @entity43 and @entity45 's @entity44 have formed partnerships with @entity9 that enable their students to access the network 's premium job listings for free			1
" our goal is to get great jobs in front of relevant people and relevant candidates in front of hiring managers , " @entity32 tells @entity2			0
@entity32 never intended to launch a career start - up			2
he was completing his mba at @entity60 in 2005 when he got the idea for @entity9 , which is a modified version of " reaching for talent " in @entity11			1
classmates were exchanging emails about career advice , and " i thought , why do n't we give this some structure ? " he recalls			0
four years and a round of venture capital funding later , what started as a hobby designed to help friends share career information has turned into a network with approximately 600,000 members			2
@entity32 estimates that roughly a dozen of the top 20 mba programs have signed partnership deals with @entity9			1
while mostly @entity80 focused , @entity9 is also becoming more international and recently sealed a deal to provide job opportunities to @entity83			1
in an age where social networking sites abound , @entity9 sets itself apart by taking closely knit relationships developed offline in b - school and leveraging them online to make a better job searching experience , @entity32 says			1
a member applying for a job at @entity93 , for instance , is able to connect with members of his or her @entity9 network that may have a @entity93 link to gain an insider 's perspective			2
@entity32 believes it is n't just the quality of people and jobs that distinguishes @entity9 from other careers sites like @entity105 and executive search service @entity107			2
@entity9 is also distinctive in that it caters specifically to students in their 20s and 30s with most of the positions advertised geared towards people at the beginning or middle of their careers			1
employers advertising positions on the site range from white shoe firms like @entity119 and @entity120 to @entity121 titans @entity122 and @entity123			0
users initially had to be invited to join the network , but now @entity9 is open to everyone			2
members , however , have to pay for access to the most exclusive job postings			0
this helps keep the membership selective , @entity32 said			0
generally , people wo n't pay for membership if they are n't qualified for the jobs being advertised , he explained			0
the fee for premium services , which gives access to the more exclusive job postings , ranges from $ 25 to $ 40 a month			0
the site , which has always featured jobs at hedge funds , private equity firms and investment banks prominently , experienced a surge when the financial crisis kicked off last fall			0
" even though the economy is not as bad as it used to be , we are still seeing a good uptake			0
our traffic is still going strong , " @entity32 says .			0
