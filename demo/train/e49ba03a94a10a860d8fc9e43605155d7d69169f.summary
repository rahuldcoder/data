@entity0 , @entity1 -- our need for oil almost wiped out the sperm whale once , and now our insatiable hunger for it threatens them again			1
sperm whales were hunted in the @entity11 in the 18th and 19th centuries for their oil , but were somewhat spared when petroleum replaced whale oil as an energy source			1
now , instead of hunters , the same oil that helped to save the sperm whales from extinction threatens their survival in the @entity11			1
sperm whales , listed as endangered in 1970 , are social animals			1
the young live with their mothers for years in stable groups , and the whales dive deep in search of food			1
because they spend so much of their lives undersea , our knowledge of their behavior and community structure is limited			0
we have a lot to learn before we can say we truly know these animals			0
we do know that sperm whales depend on the deep ocean habitat			1
and we know that habitat in the @entity11 is severely threatened by the disastrous @entity45 oil spill -- particularly as the oil spreads through plumes that go deep into the water			1
[ on tuesday , the decomposed body of a juvenile sperm whale was found 77 miles from the well , according to the @entity52			0
investigators are trying to determine whether oil played a role in its death ; it was not found in oiled water			2
] routinely holding their breath for about 45 minutes , sperm whales can dive half a mile to hunt fish and squid			1
when they arrive at the surface , they spend about nine minutes breathing and preparing for their next dive			0
about 1,665 sperm whales live in the @entity11 , according to the @entity69 , and reports say about 300 to 400 of them depend on deep waters near the mouth of the @entity74			1
@entity75 , centuries ago , found that the @entity77 , off the @entity76 , was a hot spot for sperm whales			1
a recent review of whalers ' logbooks shows that from 1788 to 1877 , about 204 voyages spent at least one season whaling in the @entity11			2
recent research indicates about 40 whales at any one time live around the @entity77 , and females and immature whales prefer this area			0
@entity45 's undersea well gushing out oil is in this canyon			1
the aftermath of the 1989 @entity94 offers a glimpse into what might be in store for the sperm whales of the @entity11			1
many @entity100 killer whales died throughout the year after that 11 million gallon spill			2
forty percent of the whales in the most exposed groups died , including all of the breeding females in one group			0
as more long - term studies emerge , we see that after 20 years , the killer whales still have not fully recovered			0
risk factors for the sperm whales of the @entity11 are similar to those for the killer whales of coastal @entity112 : they are swimming in oil ; females and juveniles depend on critical habitat near the spill , and the population is already small and isolated			1
oil can damage and kill marine mammals in myriad ways			0
the major threat to sperm whales is probably breathing in volatile organic compounds at the surface			1
the residents of @entity128 , @entity129 , may smell a bad odor from the spill , but imagine , after a 45 - minute dive , surfacing into a noxious cloud of contaminated air			2
breathing these fumes can lead to pneumonia , damage to the brain , liver and other organs ; unconsciousness and death			0
and the dispersants added to the oil are actually more volatile than crude			0
oil could also contaminate or kill the fish and squid that sperm whales eat			1
these creatures are highly sensitive to toxic compounds in oil			0
as the oil spreads , it will create a greater risk			0
in the early 1990s , the @entity155 warned about oil and gas exploration in the @entity11			2
considering the risk of a large oil spill to marine mammals , the commission said " such effects might result in the complete loss of a regional population and require three or more generations to recover			1
" @entity45 and its federal regulators ignored these warnings			2
but they were far from alone			0
every single person in the @entity169 who uses oil has a personal connection to this spill			2
as i watch footage of the oil flowing into this deepwater habitat , i realize that i am partially responsible			0
if @entity169 did n't use as much oil as we do , we would n't have to drill as much -- or at all			0
it 's too soon to say what will become of the sperm whale in the @entity11			2
but it is fair to say a new energy source wo n't suddenly emerge to replace petroleum			0
so , what can we do ? we can support clean energy in every way possible , but we also must decrease our oil consumption			1
maybe we will all be able to learn something from this disaster and adapt			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

@entity193 : sperm whales once hunted for their oil ; now oil threatens their lives
their deep water habitat in @entity11 severely threatened by the @entity45 oil spill , she writes
whales will breathe noxious fumes , she writes , and their food will be contaminated
we all share blame for this disaster because of our huge oil consumption , she says
