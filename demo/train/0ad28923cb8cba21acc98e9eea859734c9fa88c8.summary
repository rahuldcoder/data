@entity0 -- everyone 's made a joke they thought was funny only to see it fall flat , but @entity6 's attempt at humor could see him jailed for up to seven years in @entity8			1
@entity9 , a photographer by profession , re-tweeted some messages from @entity14 's official twitter feed , such as reports on the late leader @entity17 's travels across the country and negative tweets about @entity8			1
" i found the messages ludicrous because they are so harsh and the language is so out - dated			2
i found them funny , so i re-tweeted them , " @entity9 told @entity1			2
@entity9 , 23 , also took a photo of himself holding a whiskey bottle and edited in a @entity14 flag as a background for a joke			1
his supporters then doctored a @entity32 poster , replacing a smiling soldier with a sad photo of @entity9 and the image of the gun with another whiskey bottle			2
but @entity9 was imprisoned in january of this year , accused of " acts that benefit the enemy " and spreading @entity14 propaganda			1
he was released on bail in february and has another court appearance in @entity44			0
he 's still hoping the charges against him will be dropped			0
" to be honest , if you did this in @entity14 , you would be severely punished , " @entity9 said			1
" but this is @entity8 and i thought there would n't be a problem as i did it for fun			1
it certainly was n't for propaganda purposes			2
" @entity9 is the latest person to fall foul of @entity8 's controversial @entity56 ( @entity56 )			2
used widely during the years of military dictatorship in the 1970s and ' 80s , the law was designed to protect the state against @entity14 propaganda and to prosecute spies			1
but human rights groups say it was also used to persecute political dissidents and stifle freedom of speech			1
@entity65 says the law is still being abused , especially against those critical of the government 's policies on @entity14			1
" the @entity56 has a chilling effect on freedom of expression in @entity8 , " said @entity70 , @entity65 's @entity71 director			1
" it is used , not to address threats to national security , but instead to intimidate people and limit their rights to free speech			2
it should be reformed in line with human rights law and if the government can not do this , it must be abolished , " he said			0
the @entity87 has also called on @entity0 to change or repeal the law			0
president @entity90 's office declined to comment on the issue but the law has certainly been more widely used since the conservative president came to power in 2008			0
that year , just five people were prosecuted on charges of @entity98 online postings			0
two years later that number had jumped to 82			0
some within the @entity8 media are also criticizing the @entity90 administration for interfering in press freedom			1
journalists from four major networks went on strike earlier this year			0
employees from two of those stations have since gone back to work after promises from employers their concerns would be heard , but close to one thousand journalists remain on strike			0
" president @entity90 has appointed pro-government people as presidents of the media companies , what we call ' parachutes , '' said @entity115 , head of the @entity117 labor union which is still on strike			0
" they are now trying to censor our voice and stop criticism of the government , " he added			0
the government denies interference but picketing journalists say they are worried they are seeing increased censorship reminiscent of the dark days of dictatorship .			0
