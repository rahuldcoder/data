like many @entity2 , @entity1 bank clerk @entity0 shudders when asked if he would donate his organs should he die			1
there 's an old saying that our parents give us everything -- from our bodies to our hair -- and we have to show obedience to our family			0
" @entity2 said on thursday it would end the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners on january 1 and while the move has been welcomed by human rights groups , it 's hard to see how @entity2 can wean itself from the controversial practice if the views of people like @entity0 are anything to go by			1
traditional beliefs regard the body as sacred and it should remain intact after death			1
what 's more , even if people are prepared to donate , there are fears that their body parts may be traded for profit and end up on the black market			1
thus making a quick switch from organs supplied by death row inmates to a system based on altruism will be tough without a major shift in attitudes -- something the head of @entity2 's transplant system acknowledges			2
" people have concerns about whether the organs will be allocated in a fair , open and just way , " @entity44 , director of the @entity46 and @entity45 said , according to state media			0
low donation rate @entity2 has one of the world 's lowest rates of organ transplants , with 10,000 procedures each year			1
the country launched a voluntary donation scheme in 2010 but between that year and 2013 only 1,448 people donated organs -- a drop in the ocean compared with around 300,000 people in need of organ transplants each year			1
and just 0.6 people out of every million citizens have signed up to donate their organs when they die			0
to plug the shortfall , @entity2 has relied overwhelmingly on organs from death row prisoners			1
technically , their organs can only be used under certain conditions , such as if no one collects the body , the inmate gives consent or their family agrees to the medical use of the body			0
however , observers both in and outside @entity2 have questioned whether prisoners have the free will to give their consent and say it 's become an unwritten policy that prisoners ' organs can be used to ease the shortage			1
even with the new rules , it 's likely that death - row inmates will still supply organs for transplants			2
@entity44 said that prisoners will still be qualified to donate , but their organs will be registered in a computerized donation system instead of being traded privately , according to official @entity96 - language newspaper @entity95			1
skepticism @entity97 , deputy director , @entity98 , @entity99 in @entity100 , says he 's " extremely skeptical " about whether @entity2 can really end its reliance on prisoners ' organs in the foreseeable future			1
the opacity of @entity2 's prison and death penalty system , the massive profits in organ peddling and corruption make it " near impossible , " he says			1
" many @entity2 citizens would be unconvinced about voluntarily signing away their organs , even for altruistic ( reasons )			2
" such fears are not unfounded , given the flourishing underground trade in organs and even corpses			2
last month , local officials in southern @entity2 were found to have bought and sold dead bodies to fulfill cremation quotas in a " body snatching " scandal across two provinces			2
and earlier this year , authorities jailed a 12 - member gang that recruited donors online and smuggled their kidneys by disguising them as seafood shipments			0
there are tentative signs that attitudes are beginning to change			0
since the beginning of the year , 1,500 people have donated organs -- more than the total between 2010 and 2013			0
the government has set up a website to make it easier to become a donor but it 's still something that few young people are willing to discuss with their families			0
surveys have suggested that financial incentives , including payment of funeral and medical bills might help			0
@entity148 , a 24 - year old audio engineer from @entity1 , says it 's something he might consider			0
" i want to help those in need and i feel like it would be a continuation of my life , " he says			0
@entity3 's @entity154 in @entity1 contributed to the report .			0

@entity2 says it will end organ transplants from executed prisoners from january 1
traditional beliefs *discourage* organ donation in @entity2 and rates are very low
donors are also put off by fears their organs may end up traded for profit
*cultural* beliefs make it difficult to end the reliance on convicts ' organs
