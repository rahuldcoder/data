just four @entity1 drivers turned up to @entity3 's funeral after his death during qualifying for the @entity5 on april 30 1994			1
the 33 - year - old @entity8 driver 's passing was overshadowed by events that took place 24 hours later when three - time world champion @entity11 was killed in sunday 's race at the @entity14 circuit			1
on the 20th anniversary of that tragic weekend , it 's @entity11 's death that still haunts the sport while @entity3 's fate has largely been ignored			1
" he 's the forgotten man of @entity1 , " said former track rival @entity19 , who was one of the drivers at @entity3 's funeral			1
" forgotten to many , but not to me			2
" @entity3 was competing in only the third grand prix of his @entity1 career when the mountings on his @entity28 car 's front wing became dislodged on his warm - up lap after hitting a curb in qualifying			1
exiting the @entity34 corner , which would become synonymous with @entity11 's fatal accident , on the next lap , the wing broke and he went careering into a concrete wall at the @entity39 head on at 200 mph			1
while @entity11 's death spawned all manner of books and an eponymous documentary of his life , @entity3 's was a mere snapshot in that superb film			1
and while an estimated three million people flocked to the streets of @entity49 for @entity11 's funeral , about 250 people were in @entity51 as @entity3 was laid to rest			1
@entity19 was among them , paying his respects to a friendship that first started in 1985 when the pair were vying for victory in the prestigious @entity57 in @entity58			1
" i always think about @entity3 , " three - time grand prix winner @entity19 told @entity60			1
" i miss him even now			0
i think about him at certain points particularly at the @entity63 races			0
" the year before he died we had a nice dinner there -- then he was trying to get into @entity1			1
i remember him saying he was the better driver and i 'd only got into a drive with money			2
i was like ' bad luck , i 'm here you 're not ' , that 's just the kind of craic we had			2
" he was a good friend , and we 'd spoken of our dreams for many years			2
i 'd got to @entity1 before him but that season it was great to see him			2
he had this very happy face , he had that ' i got there ' face			0
" family tragedy @entity84 and @entity85 moved into their son 's @entity51 flat after his death as a way of ensuring their son 's memory is not forgotten			1
the home is littered with motorsport trophies from the junior formulae in @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity58 , pictures of their seemingly ever - smiling son on the mantelpiece			2
the couple have been to @entity14 just once since their son 's death 20 years ago to see the place where he lost his life but they will return this year for a four - day memorial to their son and @entity11			1
" it 's still heavy , " says @entity84 in broken @entity58 , " but this year we return			1
it 's a celebration of his life , a memory			2
yeah , it will be difficult to go back			0
" it 's 20 years since , 20 years of @entity3 living in that moment			1
but we live in his flat so @entity3 is always by us			2
" but we also say goodbye to @entity11 , whose death was very difficult for us too , very heavy , especially when we heard he had the red flag of @entity8 in his car he planned to fly from the cockpit for the win for @entity3			1
" that 's a very special moment for us amid the sadness			2
" @entity84 admits time has been a healer and that there is no bitterness towards the sport			0
" we were just happy that he 'd achieved his dream to be a driver in @entity1 , " he added			1
" it had been a long time driving in @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity58 to get there			0
i did n't see one of his grands prix			0
" i 've never wished that he did n't do @entity1 1 , no , because that was what he wanted to do , that was his dream			2
we were very happy for him , it was what he loved to do			0
" @entity3 , who was so delighted on making it to @entity1 he handed out pin badges with his helmet on it to supporters , is buried in the family grave with a small replica of his helmet and a picture of him on the tombstone , with the final words summing up his father 's aforementioned words translating as " he lived for his dream			1
" horror crash the couple were at home having just returned from holidaying in @entity163 and were watching qualifying in bed when the tragedy struck			0
they watched as their son came to a halt , his head slumped to one side , part of the car 's monocoque ripped aside before later footage showed his heart being pumped by the medical crews			0
" i remember his head being sloped to one side and part of the monocoque was open , " recalled @entity19			2
" i remember thinking i 'd just hoped he 'd been knocked out			0
sadly that was n't to be			0
" it was so sad as he was such a nice guy but at least he died doing what he loved doing			0
i know he knew the risks , we all did			0
" if that had happened to me , he would have wanted the others to carry on , which we did in the end			0
yes , he died too early and it was so unfair but it was something we accepted although you never thought about it			0
" author and journalist @entity199 was commentating at the time of the crash for @entity202			0
" i 'd only met @entity3 once at the previous race weekend in @entity204 in the @entity206 commentary box , " said @entity199			1
" i was struck by his nice smile , he was very handsome			0
it does n't take long to get a first impression of someone and mine was very good			0
" when the crash happened , it looked bad , it was such a vicious crash			0
there was n't a lot you could say at the time in commentary			0
" i then went back to the press room to write it up for the @entity220 newspaper and it was then the announcement was made			0
i remember the mood was absolutely terrible			0
" i 'd been in the sport long enough to have experienced deaths before but it was still such a shock , the first @entity1 driver death for 12 years			1
" @entity19 , @entity228 , @entity230 - @entity229 and @entity231 were the only @entity1 drivers of that time to attend @entity3 's funeral , along with then @entity235 president @entity234			1
in defense of his @entity1 peers , @entity19 says , " no one really knew him but also people had different ways of dealing with things			1
" @entity243 for example decided not to go to either @entity11 or @entity3 's funerals			1
i decided it was important to pay my respects to a guy i do n't think had a single enemy "			0
@entity19 continued : " he was almost a gentleman racer of a bygone era			2
in those early days , he was the driver , team boss and mechanic all in one			0
he deserved his break in @entity1 and he got it			2
" it 's just such a tragedy even today			0
" the sport paid its respects at the subsequent race in @entity64 , with a @entity260 flag laid out and an @entity8 flag painted in the front - row grid positions			1
the @entity28 team , meanwhile , committed to the rest of the season with the words ' for @entity3 ' written on the car 's airbox			1
but whereas @entity11 is understandably still revered and often talked about , @entity3 's memory has faded over the past two decades to all but a few .			1
