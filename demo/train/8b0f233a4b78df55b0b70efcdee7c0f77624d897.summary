@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity7 may have been behind the killing of @entity9 , the 26 - year - old @entity10 woman whose fatal videotaped shooting saturday made her a symbol of opposition to the june 12 presidential election results , the country 's ambassador to @entity1 said thursday			1
@entity9 , 26 , was shot to death in @entity15 on saturday			0
" this death of @entity9 is very suspicious , " ambassador @entity16 said			2
" my question is , how is it that this miss @entity9 is shot from behind , got shot in front of several cameras , and is shot in an area where no significant demonstration was behind held ? " he suggested that the @entity23 or another intelligence service may have been responsible			1
" well , if the @entity23 wants to kill some people and attribute that to the government elements , then choosing women is an appropriate choice , because the death of a woman draws more sympathy , " @entity16 said			1
in response , @entity23 spokesman @entity33 said , " any suggestion that the @entity23 was responsible for the death of this young woman is wrong , absurd and offensive			1
" though the video appeared to show that she had been shot in the chest , @entity16 said that the bullet was found in her head and that it was not of a type used in @entity10			1
" these are the methods that terrorists , the @entity23 and spy agencies employ , " he said			1
" naturally , they would like to see blood spilled in these demonstrations , so that they can use it against the @entity10			1
this is of the common methods that the @entity23 employs in various countries			1
" but , he added , " i am not saying that now the @entity23 has done this			2
it could be the [ work of another ] intelligence service ; it could be the @entity23 ; it could be the terrorists			1
anyway , there are people who employ these types of methods			0
" asked about his government 's imposition of restrictions on reporting by international journalists , @entity16 blamed the reporters themselves			2
" some of the reporters and mass media do not reflect the truth , " he said			2
for example , he said , international news organizations have lavished coverage on demonstrations by supporters of @entity83 , whom the government has said lost to the incumbent president @entity85 by a landslide			2
but those same news organizations have not shown " many , many demonstrations in favor of the winner , " he said			0
further , he said , members of the international news media have failed to report on people setting banks and buses afire or attacking other people			0
" the only things they show are the reactions of the police , " he said			0
because of restrictions on reporting in @entity10 , @entity2 has been unable to confirm many of the reports and claims relating to protests			1
@entity16 said it is only fair that security forces protect the lives and property of the @entity10 people			1
" if in @entity7 supporters of mr. @entity112 had gotten out on the street and tried to burn the banks during the last election , do you think the police would just sit idly by and be a spectator ? " he asked , referring to the @entity119 presidential candidate who lost the presidential vote in november to @entity121			0
@entity16 called on backers of @entity83 to " accept the majority 's victory			0
" @entity85 's overwhelming victory was no surprise , @entity16 said , noting that a poll published in the @entity7 three weeks before the june 12 elections showed @entity85 with a commanding lead			0
" why do n't you show that ? " he asked			0
@entity16 also addressed questions about the rapid reporting of the election results , which the opposition has cited as evidence that the ballots were not properly counted			0
" it was n't said that only four people counted the 40 million votes , " he said			0
" there were tens of thousands of people in @entity10 who counted these votes			2
they declared that this is very simple			0
