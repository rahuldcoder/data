@entity0 -- for me , touring the @entity2 felt kind of like i was exploring my grandmother 's attic for the first time , not knowing what i 'd find			1
the ship offers lots of room for surprises			1
it stretches the length of @entity15 's @entity14 and is 100 feet longer than the @entity16			2
its legendary decks were the site of untold stories , where movie stars rubbed shoulders with famous musicians and kings			2
on its first voyage , the @entity2 set a trans - @entity27 speed record -- three days , 10 hours and 42 minutes -- a feat that has never been surpassed			1
the ship 's late designer @entity29 constructed the vessel with fireproof materials , saying , " you ca n't set her on fire , you ca n't sink her , and you ca n't catch her			1
" now , six decades after its heyday , the vessel dubbed " @entity40 's flagship " is in need of a rescue			2
expensive maintenance may force the owners to sell the historic ship for scrap metal , unless a solution can be found			1
during my tour through the dark and damp shell of former grandeur , the vastness of @entity29 ' creation became even more evident			0
@entity29 , a naval architect responsible for nearly 5,500 @entity53 vessels that helped win @entity55 , put everything he had into his ultimate ship			2
the 2,200 - passenger liner also was meant to double as a troop transport ship if war broke out			1
@entity62 ' obsession with creating the perfect ocean liner has now transformed into his granddaughter 's obsession with saving it			1
" my grandfather was once asked who do you love more , this ship or my grandmother , and he said , ' the ship , a thousand percent , ' " said @entity68 , executive director of the @entity2			1
" this is an extraordinary @entity40 achievement , an amazing expression of our post-war history , and it would be so tragic to see it destroyed			0
" standing in the sunlight flooding the hefty enclosed promenade , @entity29 admits she never traveled aboard " @entity83 " " i did n't know my grandfather			0
he died when i was young , " she said , gazing out the floor - to - ceiling windows			2
" but i 've gotten to know him through this ship			2
" " he felt this was the perfect ship and loved what she said about the nation			2
he saw the ship as a metaphor for the nation 's post-war strength , pride and accomplishment			1
" @entity29 remembers traveling to @entity0 from her home in @entity100 to see the @entity2 for the first time			1
along the way , she read her grandmother 's diary out loud in the car			2
the journal revealed tales about the ship 's maiden voyage and a joyful conga line celebrating the new speed record			1
it unveiled a bygone era when passengers donned mink stoles and enjoyed a liquor selection that included 49 kinds of scotch			0
full of nostalgia , @entity29 snapped back to reality when the car edged closer to the dock			0
she gasped at her first sight of the weathered ship			2
" when i walked on board , it was only a shadow of that , " she said			0
" i was saddened , but determined that we can not let the ship go			2
" walking through the ship 's empty belly , i can feel that sadness too			1
gone are the stately furnishings and decorations			0
all that remain of the cabins are outlines on the floor , accompanied by plugged toilet holes			0
it was hard not to feel like i was trespassing on property that was ransacked			0
only this was no robbery -- the ship 's interior fittings were auctioned off in the ' 80s			1
despite the missing fittings , the @entity2 remains nothing less than majestic			1
the longer i was on the ship , the easier it was to imagine it full of life			0
i could picture @entity156 chatting with artist @entity157 in the ballroom ; hear @entity159 on stage tickling the ivories on one of the ship 's fireproof pianos ; or watch president @entity165 and first lady @entity166 strolling on the decks			1
@entity169 's father worked as a steward on the @entity2			1
today , he oversees the liner 's redevelopment project and is looking for partners to help save it			1
out of service since 1969 , the former reserve ship for the @entity53 has been docked in @entity0 since the mid- 1990s			0
the goal is to turn it into a stationary entertainment complex and museum			1
" it 's an irreplaceable part of @entity40 history , and once it 's gone , it 'll never come back , and we 'll never have anything like it in the future , " said @entity169 , managing director of the @entity180			0
" it 's not a vanity project			0
this is going to create jobs and be the crown jewel of a waterfront district			0
" " if we lose it , we 'll never get it back			0
" for now , the clock is ticking			0
keeping the ship afloat costs nearly $ 80,000 a month for basic maintenance , insurance and security			0
the @entity2 launched a website where visitors can sponsor a piece of the ship for $ 1 per square inch			1
@entity29 says they have about two months before they 'll have to sell the ship for scrap -- something she wo n't even allow herself to think about			0
" its name is the @entity2 , and she 's been here ( in @entity0 ) for 17 years because she 's not done yet , " @entity29 said			1
" we have to save her			0
" as @entity29 and i found our way off the ship , my shoes crackled against the crumbling , faded green surface of the outside deck -- like walking across an abandoned tennis court			0
we waved goodbye , and i wandered across the dock and turned around			0
tilting my head back as far as i could , i stared up at her mighty bow			0
i could n't help but notice the ship 's towering sides were stained with streaks of rust -- the tears of a once proud iron lady .			1

historic ocean liner @entity2 is running out of money and may have to be scrapped
ship designer 's granddaughter : " we have to save her "
supporters hope to make the ship a stationary entertainment complex and museum
