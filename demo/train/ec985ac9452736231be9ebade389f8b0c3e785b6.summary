-- a top defector from the @entity3 military said saturday that armed rebel groups have aligned under the leadership of the @entity6			1
uniting all efforts will bolster the anti-regime movement and safeguard the nation , @entity10			1
gen. @entity11 said in a video posted on @entity13			0
the move addressed a key concern for observers of the @entity3 crisis both inside and outside the country -- that armed rebel groups were disjointed and divided			1
@entity11 was one of the first high - ranking officers to announce his defection from president @entity22 's forces			0
he was accompanied in the video by @entity6 commander col. @entity24			0
" in these critical and difficult times that our beloved country is going through , all the honorable men and women in this nation are required to work on uniting all efforts to overthrow this corrupt regime , " @entity11 said			0
" the soldiers and officers of the @entity6 pledged their allegiance to protect the people and the nation			1
" not long after the video was posted , fresh attacks by the regime killed at least 54 people across the country , the opposition @entity43 said			1
of the dead , 25 were in the war - torn city of @entity47 , rife with anti-government sentiment			0
@entity3 's state - run news agency said funeral processions were held for 18 members of the military and police			0
it blamed their deaths on armed terrorist groups			0
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in @entity3 because the government severely restricts access by international journalists			0
the @entity63 estimates the @entity3 conflict has killed more than 8,000 people ; opposition activists put the toll at more than 10,000			1
in the @entity13 video , @entity11 outlined rebel decisions			1
" first , we decided to unite all the military councils and battalions and all the armed battalions inside the country under one unified leadership of the @entity6 and to follow the orders of the commander of the @entity6 , col. @entity24 , " @entity11 said			2
second , with the @entity6 serving and protecting @entity3 , " any movement to carry out a military operation or do anything outside the framework of the @entity6 " will be held responsible for any act they carry out , " @entity11 warned			2
third , the rebels called for soldiers and officers in the @entity3 armed forces " who do n't have blood on their hands " to defect and join the ranks of the @entity6			0
@entity11 's appearance with @entity24 also mended rifts between the two main defectors ' groups , the @entity6 and the @entity96			2
in february , a spokesman for the @entity96 announced @entity11 was the leader of the group , which claimed to lead armed defectors within @entity3			1
but @entity24 , who was leading the @entity6 from the @entity101 border with @entity3 , quickly rejected the claim			0
" this man represents himself , " @entity24 said of @entity11 last month			0
" he has nothing to do with the @entity6			0
... those people are representing themselves and do not represent the revolution and the @entity6			2
they do n't represent anybody			0
" " the division is over			2
all the parties involved in the revolution carried out all the efforts to form one united front to better represent and defend the @entity3 people , " @entity6 lt. @entity114 said			2
" in the past , there were some minor technical disagreements , but this is all behind us from now on , " he said			0
@entity119 will lead all field operations of the @entity6 , while @entity11 will remain head of the @entity96 and will represent the @entity6 in trying to get weapons and international support , @entity114 said			0
some world leaders have been hesitant to send arms to the rebels , saying the opposition movement is fractured and that a political solution is still possible			2
the unification also allows rebels to unilaterally deny attacks carried out by other groups			2
the @entity3 government routinely blames the vaguely defined " armed terrorist groups " for violence in the country , while most reports from inside @entity3 indicate the government is slaughtering civilians in an attempt to wipe out dissidents			0
meanwhile , @entity142 , the @entity63 - @entity143 special envoy to @entity3 , arrived in @entity144 on saturday in an effort to seek @entity147 help in securing a cease - fire			1
@entity142 will also visit @entity150 this weekend , his spokesman said			1
@entity147 and @entity151 have blocked @entity153 attempts to pass resolutions condemning the @entity22 regime			1
the two countries say they want the violence to stop but argue that previous resolutions were not evenhanded			0
@entity147 and @entity151 have major trade deals with @entity3 , and again friday they refused to condemn @entity22 's regime formally by voting against a @entity162 resolution condemning " appalling human rights violations in @entity3			1
" the resolution passed 41 - 3 , with @entity164 casting the other negative vote			0
the @entity166 called the resolution a " unilateral assessment " of the crisis -- blaming solely the regime for the violence			2
@entity171 , however , lashed out at the @entity147 ministry 's use of an open letter published by the global monitoring group that described atrocities committed by armed groups affiliated with the @entity3 opposition			1
the organization said it had learned that @entity147 diplomats used the open letter in informal @entity153 discussions march 22 in an attempt to equate the violence by both sides			1
" @entity147 's attention to concerns expressed in the letter to the @entity3 opposition is a positive development , " @entity171 said			1
" the selective use of the findings , however , causes serious concern			0
" it said @entity147 had ignored detailed documentation of widespread and systematic abuses by the @entity22 regime , including killings of peaceful protesters , shelling of residential neighborhoods , large - scale arbitrary detention and torture , executions , denial of medical assistance , looting , and " disappearances			1
" " none of these findings have been ever acknowledged by @entity147 officials , " the group said			1
the @entity153 this week urged immediate implementation of @entity142 's proposed peace plan			1
the 15 - member body , including @entity151 and @entity147 , expressed full support for @entity142 's efforts			1
@entity0 's @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and journalist @entity219 contributed to this report .			0
