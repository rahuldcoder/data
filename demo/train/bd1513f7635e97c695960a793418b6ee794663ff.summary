-- the radio was going on about the space shuttle 's last mission			1
i 've never been a space person , but there was still something sad about it			1
no more space for us			1
shuttle launches were like @entity7 's homeroom			1
the whole country checked in			1
the whole business left me feeling wistful as my friend and i hurtled along in our own white craft drawing a line across the desert from @entity21 to @entity22			1
a quarter of the way there : @entity25 flapping like flags in the wind			1
half - built houses mark the edge of @entity30			1
the high - water mark of the building boom			1
halfway there : we stop in @entity35 for cheeseburgers and @entity37			1
and then it was back into the @entity39			1
mountains the color of cocoa sticking up from the earth			2
the sun a @entity45 fry lamp on the side of my face			2
guilt from leaving work early tugged on me like the air conditioner dragged on the car engine			2
" @entity53 " my father used to call it			1
a pun pointed at the town 's gambling industry that now just as easily applies to its entire economy			2
the great recession walloped @entity22 harder than most places			1
it was a subprime boomtown that is now the foreclosure capital of @entity7			1
what 's @entity22 like in a down economy ? are there a few more sips left in the champagne bottle ? yes			1
when we arrived on the @entity71 , storm clouds were gathered around the @entity73 replica			2
a double take confirmed that they were real			2
rain in the desert , what were the odds ? a rhetorical question in any city but this one			2
visiting there is like stepping into mainstream television : common - denominator vulgarity that you ca n't keep your eyes off of			1
" pleasure " pumped into elephantine proportions			2
like a basket containing the world 's largest gourd held by a woman with the world 's largest breasts			2
do n't get me wrong , i like sex , gambling and tippling , but its hyper - commercialization brings me down			1
like how passing a blown - up picture of a chili dog on a semi ruins your appetite instead of whetting it			1
in the belly of the @entity109 parking lot we unload our bags			2
parents walk by holding children			2
slightly older children walk by holding suitcases of beer			2
there is an optimism inherent in a clean hotel room at the beginning of a weekend			2
this will be my headquarters			2
i will hang my clothes here			2
this will be my desk			2
@entity22 hotel stays carry an additional air of mischief			1
we 'll drink here before we go out			2
i will close the curtains so the sun does n't come in tomorrow			2
i 'll choose this bed because it 's closer to the door and @entity138 knows when i 'm coming back			2
we decided to walk over to the recently renovated @entity140 hotel and casino			0
in the postmodern @entity142 that is @entity22 , the @entity140 is @entity144 's @entity143			1
the building 's handsome white gleam and jaunty retro sign held the promise of an excellent martini , and soon i was behind one the size of an office trash can			0
we were the only people at the bar ; 7 p.m. is a dead zone in summertime vegas			1
all day long people attend pool parties			0
and then late at night they attend clubs			0
from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. is reserved for showers , tv and energy drinks			0
our booby prize was a video screen behind the bar showing an endlessly looping video of , well , boobs , and other body parts wrapped up in bathing suits and gyrating to music			0
like songs that tell you how to dance , the decorations in @entity22 are constantly showing you how you are supposed to behave			1
later , while eating hamburgers at @entity174 's " @entity173 , " we are surrounded by picture of hamburgers -- hamburgers that look much juicier and more appetizing than the ones we were eating			0
in my back pocket i had a set of tips my father sent me			0
do n't hit if the dealer has 3 - 6 and you have a bustable hand			1
if you 're dealt two aces always split them and then pray for tens , etc. i withdrew $ 300 from the atm and watched my pile go up and down for hours			0
i toggled from scotch to seltzer			0
the fast one who prefers the ladies			0
the deliberate one who wordlessly guides the players			0
the efficient , emotionless machine who just deals , deals , deals			0
and then there was the ever - changing cast of players			1
the fat drunk tanktopper smoking a cigarette filter			0
two @entity212 kids with gelled sea anemone hair			0
the chubby secretary who would scratch the table with her pink - painted fingernail every time she wanted a hit			1
and at one point in the night , superstar singer @entity219 and his @entity221 underwear - model wife sidle up to the table and do well until a crowd of squealing girls forms and he is forced to cash out			1
walk back to the room			0
a fight breaks out behind me			0
a girl lies legs - splayed on a flower planter in the lobby			1
a couple ruts next to the soda machine			0
a man lies face down in his own vomit			0
prostitutes roam the floor looking for drunk prey			0
a topless guy smokes a cigarette in my elevator			0
as the door shuts and the elevator lifts , i can still hear the bingbinging clamor of @entity7 spending its energy - drink money on @entity251 hold ' em. in the morning it 's dim sum on @entity254 , @entity22 ' version of @entity256			1
yes , the city has the skyline of @entity259 and @entity260 , the canals of @entity262 and the pools of @entity143 , but the real spin around the world happens in the neighborhoods that surround the @entity71			0
about 22 % of @entity267 are immigrants who were attracted by the low cost of living and the abundance of service jobs that do n't require a higher education			0
the city 's strip malls are an international food court			0
we meet cabbies from @entity283 , @entity284 , and the @entity285			0
this global village aspect of @entity22 is one of the most exhilarating parts of the area and could be a draw unto itself			1
they could call it " @entity293			0
" from @entity22 ' future to its past : downtown			1
neon and $ 9 prime rib specials			0
the home of old guard @entity22 -- @entity303 's , the @entity304 and the @entity305			1
there are $ 5 blackjack tables here and strawberry daiquiris with whipped cream			0
to draw some of the action back from the @entity71 , businesses chipped in and created the @entity313 , a barrel vault canopy 90 feet high and four blocks long			0
it shelters folks from the sun in the day and turns into a light show at night			0
people rappel under the canopy			0
it 's livened up the area , but it 's what has n't been done to the neighborhood that 's going to save it : the old gambling houses in this neighborhood just feel right			0
an old piece of @entity7 that has hung on			1
a symbol that there is life after a bubble			0
the next day we leave the greatest example of @entity7 excess and visit the greatest example of @entity7 restraint : @entity343			1
there are only 3,485 days and counting of water left in @entity22 , literally			1
the canyon surrounding @entity343 is the evidence			1
its walls are chalk white where the water line used to be			0
you have to move your head forward toward your belly to see where the water line is now			0
i piss in one of the magnificent marble art deco restrooms that sit on top of the dam			0
the windows there provide a dramatic view of this modern wonder of the world			0
nowhere in @entity7 today is a bathroom being built like this , nor will one be built in the near future			1
unless , maybe , someone decides to open up a resort on the strip called " @entity7 then			1
" they could buy a mothballed space shuttle and hang it in the lobby .			0

@entity376 takes road trip to " @entity53 "
@entity379 : @entity22 was a subprime boomtown that is now the foreclosure capital of @entity7
he samples @entity22 ' hyper - commercial present , ethnic - *tapestry* future and iconic past
vegas : the image of @entity7 excess ; @entity343 : the image of @entity7 restraint
