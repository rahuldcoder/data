you can roll it , ferment it , dry it and put holes in it			0
it can be stinky enough to be banned on public transport , crawling with maggots or hard enough to break your teeth			1
cheese is savored all around the world -- even if some of it is an acquired taste			1
@entity15 ( @entity16 ) like caviar , @entity15 is enjoyed only by a select population			0
that 's because it 's served with live maggots			2
it does have a fan base in @entity24 , where sheep farmers for centuries have made pecorino cheese and left it to rot and attract flies			1
when the flies ' eggs hatch the transformation takes place and the cheese becomes @entity15			2
it 's then consumed with relish or perhaps trepidation -- it has an aftertaste that lasts for hours			0
@entity39 called it " the most dangerous cheese in the world			2
" where to try it : @entity15 contains live insects so it ca n't be imported			2
@entity24 is therefore still the best option at associations such as @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity24 ; www.agugliastra.it			0
@entity50 ( @entity51 ) just when you thought the @entity16 took the proverbial cheese for their maggots , along come the @entity51 with their mite excrement variety			1
produced in @entity57 from quark , it sits among dust mites for several months , with some rye for them to nibble on			1
the mites excrete an enzyme to ripen the cheese that turns it progressively yellow , red - brown and then black , at which point it 's eaten , mites and all			1
bitter and zesty , the cheese is said to have curative effects for allergies to house dust			1
if you 'd like some cheese with your mites , there 's a mite - shaped memorial in @entity57 -- in the hollow base there 's some @entity50 left for passersby to try			1
where to try it : locally in @entity57 , @entity51			0
yak cheese ( @entity87 communities ) imagine sucking and gnawing a piece of cheese - flavored resin for several hours and you 'll get an idea of how hard this cheese is -- it could in fact break your teeth , although there are softer varieties			2
the cheese is made by wrapping the curd from yak 's milk in cloth and pressing it to get rid of the water			1
when it dries out it 's cut into pieces and allowed to dry , often over a wood fire			0
it 's earthy and tasty			0
the yak is the male of the species and does n't produce milk , so it really should be called nak cheese after the female			1
where to try it : markets in @entity87 areas of @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
@entity124 cheese ( @entity125 ) @entity124 cheese , or horse milk cheese , is common in @entity125 where the horse is still integral to life in many places			1
to make airag , a mare is milked during foaling season and the milk left to ferment with an agent such as last season 's airag			2
it 's either suspended next to the ger / yurt entrance so anyone passing can stir it or it 's tied to a saddle to achieve the same effect over a day 's riding			0
the airag is then added to boiled milk to curdle it , filtered through a fabric bag and pressed			2
it can be eaten fresh or dried			0
the dry variety is a popular snack out on the steppe , softened by soaking it in tea or soup			0
where to try it : out on the @entity125 steppe in the ger / yurt of a nomadic family			0
@entity161 's milk cheese ( @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity166 communities ) nomadic herders across @entity168 have been milking their camels for centuries			1
not only are the resilient beasts a more viable alternative to cows in dry climates , but their rich , earthy milk has more fat and protein			2
however , making cheese from camel milk is a more difficult process , so herders use camel rennet from pieces of the animal 's stomach to coagulate the milk and create curds			1
this may account for its sour taste and pungent aroma			0
to enjoy camelbert options you 'll have to visit supermarket shelves in @entity193 , the @entity194 and @entity195			0
it 's also found in @entity197			2
where to try it : supermarket shelves in @entity193 , the @entity194 and @entity195 ; @entity200 in the @entity201 ; @entity202 in @entity203			0
human milk cheese ( @entity205 ) when the freezer of @entity205 chef @entity208 started to overflow with his wife 's breast milk , he decided to experiment with it rather than throw it out			1
he blogged about the process online with photos of mother 's milk with beets and romaine , dehydrated porcini mushroom and onion chutney			2
for those feeling queasy , rest assured the cheese was never produced in his restaurant or sold			2
as for commercial opportunities , lactating mothers ca n't produce anything like the quantity of breast milk needed to make large quantities of cheese			1
where to try it : not yet commercially available			0
@entity235 cheese in a country that celebrates @entity238 , it should come as no surprise that @entity235 cheese remains a staple on grocery shelves -- the texture and meltability are perfect for toasted sandwiches and burgers			1
technically , of course , @entity235 cheese is n't even real cheese -- ingredients include milk , whey , milkfat , salt , gelatine , milk powder , dyed orange , artificial flavors and oil			1
the odd concoction is blended with a generic processed cheese to form the smooth , creamy and super-melty slices that are either loved , tolerated or abhorred around the @entity235			1
where to try it : @entity263 's , @entity235 food supermarkets			1
lichen cheese ( @entity266 ) when a small @entity269 company found out the @entity270 once ate a fermented lichen from the stomach of caribou that tasted like blue cheese , they decided to try it for themselves			1
using @entity269 goat 's milk and lichen , the company creates a mold from roasting and boiling the lichen , then lets it rest and ferment			2
the cheese is still in its experimental stage			2
where to try it : @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity266			0
deer milk cheese ( @entity289 ) reindeer milk cheese has been produced among the @entity291 in @entity292 for years			1
now , cheese from the humble red deer may soon become a hallmark of @entity289			0
the combined work of scientists and a cheese maker have resulted in the first cheese from the @entity301 bambi			0
at $ 100 per liter , the rich deer milk is n't cheap , but with half of the world 's farmed red deer production in @entity289 , farmers are getting excited about the possibility of having a product to sell beyond venison			1
where to try it : buy it from @entity314 cheese company , @entity313 , @entity289			0
alpaca and llama cheese ( @entity318 communities ) life on the harsh @entity320 would be a struggle without the alpacas and llamas that give their dung for fuel , hide for leather , wool for clothing and milk for cheese			1
comical though they may appear -- they even give the occasional spit and unusual noise -- they 're a little tricky to milk			0
once extracted , though , their whole milk can be made into a long - lasting cheese that 's salty , rich and heavy in texture			1
this finds its way into markets and local food like empanadas , though most travelers come across it only when visiting locals			0
where to try it : local markets , @entity318 region , @entity354			0
donkey cheese ( @entity356 ) at the @entity359 , 50 kilometers out of @entity358 , you can get your hands on pule , or donkey cheese			1
while healthy -- it has 60 times more vitamin c than cow 's milk -- donkeys only produce 200 ml of milk a day			0
about 25 liters are required to make just one kilogram of cheese			0
that means the white , crumbly pule is both limited and costly			0
currently it goes for about € 1,000 a kilo , or $ 576 a pound			0
the reserve also makes soap , a liquor and facial cream from the milk			1
@entity378 claimed her beauty was due to bathing in donkey milk			1
where to try it : in the @entity359 , or buy it online at www.zasavica.org.rs .			0

strange cheeses include those made with maggots , dust mites and even human breast milk
@entity235 cheese , such as that found in fast food burgers , is n't really a cheese at all
a @entity356 group makes cheese from donkey milk
