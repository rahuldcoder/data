-- a year ago , @entity1 celebrated the death of dictator @entity3			1
i wrote then that despite enormous challenges , the country 's prospects were actually pretty good			0
its small , relatively well - educated population and abundant oil wealth certainly gave it a leg up on neighboring @entity13 , which has to make its transition under dire economic circumstances			0
@entity1 's path was never going to be easy , but its trajectory since @entity3 's death has defied the worst predictions of chaos and civil war			1
the @entity22 , headed by @entity23 , oversaw the first phase of transition			0
it managed to bring all of @entity1 's factions to the bargaining table , crafted an electoral law and held successful elections on july 7			2
despite security concerns , some 3,700 candidates contested 200 seats with a minimal violence			0
turnout was high among the 1.8 million @entity1 who registered to vote in the country 's first election since 1965			1
bucking the @entity40 tide that swept @entity41 and @entity13 , @entity1 's secularists fared well , with the relatively progressive @entity42 winning 39 out of the 80 seats			1
news : rights group recounts @entity3 's last bloody moments , calls for justice there has also been a flowering of civil society in a country that for decades had almost none			1
dozens of new organizations focusing on issues such as democracy building , the environment and women 's rights have formed in the past year			1
some groups played an important role in advocating for a female quota in the electoral law			0
as a result of that preference -- which required political parties to alternate male and female candidates on their ballots -- women won 33 of the 200 seats			0
and thousands of @entity1 shared their opinions of the draft law through the council 's website and phone line and through social media			2
@entity1 went from being barred from any kind of organized activity outside the reach of @entity3 's network to creating a rich civic dialogue in a matter of months			1
but @entity1 faces profound challenges , most notably the threat from armed militias that still control parts of the country			1
some of those militias adhere to radical , jihadi ideologies			0
the terrorist attack on the @entity91 consulate in @entity92 in which four @entity91 died , including ambassador @entity93 , is a stark reminder of the danger posed by heavily armed militias and extremists			0
the government 's inability to bring these militias under state control has contributed to an environment of lawlessness			2
@entity3 timeline : a long 8 months in @entity1 much of the violence is fueled by bitter tribal rivalries			2
over the past few weeks , competing militias have fought to take control of the town of @entity110 from @entity3 loyalists			2
in some places , the militias are given free rein by a government that can not provide security			0
the prevalence of weapons -- many of them looted from @entity3 's arsenals -- makes things worse			1
still , especially after the @entity92 attack , thousands of @entity1 have protested the rise of the militias , demanding that the government disarm them			2
undoubtedly , this is an important inflection point in @entity1 's transition -- a moment when the government must rein in the militias or see them become more deeply entrenched , more emboldened and harder to dislodge			1
photos : a silent @entity1 after @entity3 @entity1 's next challenge is the writing of a new constitution , and it has set itself an ambitious , perhaps impossible , timeline of a draft within 60 days of the constitutional committee 's first meeting			1
the country needs time to debate the big issues , and the more actively involved a broad cross-section of civil society is , the better the outcome			1
as is true in @entity13 and @entity41 , religion will be a flashpoint in the constitution			0
already , various groups are pressing to make @entity149 a central source of law , while others are trying to restrict the role of religion			0
how @entity149 is reconciled with human rights in general , and women 's rights in particular , will be a litmus test for which path forward @entity1 chooses			1
the division of power between the central government and the regions will also be critical to resolve , especially since significant oil resources are at stake			0
@entity1 rightly fear a scenario of civil war fought along regional lines , reminiscent of the tragedy in @entity168			0
clearly , @entity1 must overcome many political pitfalls and security challenges before it can successfully emerge from its transition			0
but it has already made significant progress with a legitimate first election , a flowering of civil society and a briskly recovering economy			1
the @entity91 should continue to support the @entity1 with technical assistance , capacity building , military intelligence and critical training of security forces			0
@entity182 : the @entity1 who knew too much the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity186 : a year after @entity3 's death , @entity1 defied predictions , has made gains
she says in an election that included women , secularists did well ; civil society blooming
she says militias and extremists pose big threat to gains ; government must get control
@entity206 : new constitution will be litmus test for reconciling @entity149 with women 's rights
