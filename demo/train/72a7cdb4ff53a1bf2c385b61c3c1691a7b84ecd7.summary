-- it 's the super yacht with a super model and her billionaire tycoon husband as its joint owners and the 100ft supermaxi @entity7 lived up to expectations with a blazing start to the @entity13 @entity12 - @entity11 race friday			1
the ' @entity14 ' in its 70th staging is the first real competitive test for @entity17 , which has been specially built for distance racing and speed record attempts , the brainchild of @entity22 co-founder @entity21 and his wife , @entity23 , who was born in @entity24			1
@entity17 , skippered by @entity26 @entity25 and with a strong international crew , is expected to battle it out for line honors with seven - time winner @entity30 in the 628 - nautical miles race , one of the highlights of the international yachting calendar			1
the traditional @entity37 start from @entity38 saw an early glimpse of @entity17 's speed with the skipper of @entity30 , @entity42 , moved to exclaim : " she 's smoking -- look at that thing go ! " out to sea and past the first mark in an unofficial record time , @entity17 led from @entity30 with the other supermaxis @entity48 giving chase			2
the race , which runs down the east coast of @entity24 and across the @entity53 to the @entity55 capital @entity11 , has drawn a 117 - strong entry , the biggest since 1994			1
but pre-race attention has centered on @entity17 -- with its wide - bodied and cutting edge design , and two years in the building in @entity60 in the @entity26			2
@entity21 watched from a supporting boat as his wife was part of the crew when @entity7 took part in the @entity66 in @entity38 on december 9 , won by @entity30 but the short race was just a small taster for the bigger test and @entity23 opted out of competing , two days before the start , due to fears her inexperience might hamper the race favorite in predicted difficult conditions			1
she also has three - year - old and four - month - old children to look after so both joint owners are safely shore side to track the progress of their costly boat			0
" we 're ready , " @entity25 told the official race website before the start , unperturbed by reports of the rougher conditions ahead			0
" to me it looks like a nice sailboat racing day			0
a little breezy , a little lumpy , but if our boat ca n't handle 25 knots and a little bit of bump then something 's wrong			0
" the weather forecast would appear to rule out the chance of a new race record , the current mark set by @entity30 in 2012 , of one day 18 hours 23 minutes and 12 seconds , and there were several early withdrawals in the testing conditions			0
