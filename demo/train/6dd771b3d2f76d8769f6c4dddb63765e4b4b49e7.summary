-- as location - based apps go , @entity1 or @entity2 will work just fine if you 're looking for the spot where all your buddies are having a beer			1
but what if they discovered an awesome , out - of - the - way spot six months ago ? or , better yet , what if you did n't even know you were looking for a watering hole until your phone told you there 's one around the corner you should n't miss ? as the novelty of the simple check - in fades , and the abilities of gps - based location technology expand , some new mobile apps -- call them " discovery apps " -- are looking to parlay mobile " noise " into useful , place - based tips			1
" it feels like the paradigm shift in the late ' 90s when @entity30 came along , " said @entity23 , ceo of @entity24 , which released the app @entity27 this month			1
" there 's an information overload -- to find something useful for you is a very daunting task			0
it 's time for a new shift ; it 's time to make sense of it and make it useful for you			0
" @entity27 has been called " @entity43 for the real world			1
" users feed it information about their favorite places ( mainly restaurants , bars and coffee shops )			2
then , theoretically , @entity27 -- a mustachioed robot butler -- can suggest similar spots that are nearby , no matter where you are			1
the free app , currently on @entity58 's @entity57 system , with @entity61 and @entity60 versions in the works , was rolled out this month and took top honors in the " @entity69 " contest at the @entity66 conference in @entity67 , @entity68			0
the app , which was two years in the making , uses a web - crawling algorithm to pull the information together and , according to @entity23 , recognized the difference between positive and negative chatter about a place			2
" there 's so much information on the @entity80 , but it 's all scattered , " he said			0
" you almost need an assistant or chaperone to go out and find things to figure out what matters to you			2
" if @entity87 's app relies on software , @entity89 , co-created by the founder of travel site @entity91 , is fueled by other folks and their cell phones			1
unveiled thursday after three months in trial mode , @entity89 is a photography app. but its similarities to hot tools like @entity99 or @entity101 end there			1
instead , it 's about documenting your discoveries , from a cool statue to an out - of - the - way restaurant to the best spot to view the surrounding scenery			0
@entity108 , the @entity91 founder and a @entity110 alum who also founded real - estate site @entity112 , said he and @entity89 ceo @entity113 are both avid travelers			1
" and we 've been brainstorming for years to figure out a way that we could carry with us , as we went , all our friends ' recommendations on what to do , where to go and what to see , " he said			0
" would n't it be great if we had a little voice whispering , ' take a right there ' ... or ' hey , you 're passing the best gelato place in @entity127			0
' " using gps on a smartphone ( currently just the @entity130 , but with an @entity61 version in the works ) , the app shows users photos that other people have taken in the area			1
apps like @entity137 ! already let users search for restaurants or other destinations			1
but @entity89 's founders say their app does something else			2
" people that are using @entity89 now ... say @entity89 has become part of the rotation of apps that they use -- @entity89 combined with @entity137 ! and @entity1 and @entity99 , " @entity113 said			1
" with @entity89 , it 's really a different kind of experience			2
it 's really built more around exploration than targeted search			0
as you travel around a neighborhood , you can have these serendipitous kinds of experiences			0
" used friday at @entity0 's @entity161 offices , the app rendered images of folks standing beside the giant @entity0 logo , spots in @entity166 , concert footage from nearby venue the tabernacle and even a buffalo head on the wall of a @entity173 restaurant			2
with about 70,000 users who 've found the app despite it being in stealth mode , the founders have already seen it used in an unexpected way : by street artists and their fans			0
" that 's two groups that have never really been able to get together , and they 're getting together on @entity89 , " @entity108 said			2
users can , of course , create their own " troves " by taking and uploading pictures of their own			0
@entity89 and @entity27 are n't the only new apps geared , at least in part , to place - based discovery			1
@entity192 lets people upload audio files to an interactive map			0
@entity196 lets users send questions to nearby users and tap into comments from other mobile apps about surrounding locations			1
" with these new ( @entity205 ) sensors , it 's all new data , " @entity23 said			0
" it 's about making sense out of it for you , and these new technologies that are forming are about taking all these data points and aggregating it to make it more useful for you			0

as location technology grows , mobile apps are *trending* toward " discovery "
@entity89 lets users see photos of *interesting* things that others have *shared* nearby
@entity27 , from @entity24 , uses a web crawler to *compare* your favorites to spots near you
