editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 professor of modern @entity5 and @entity6 studies at @entity7 , is the author of " @entity8 : my day in @entity9 with @entity10			1
" she was the target of a @entity13 libel lawsuit by @entity10 , a historian she said had become a spokesman for @entity6 denial			1
@entity2 won the case in april 2000			1
read her blog here @entity2 says the @entity6 love story seemed incredible on its face			1
( @entity21 ) -- i do n't know whether to be sad or angry -- or both			2
the recent expos√© of the fact that @entity27 's @entity6 memoir is a hoax was no surprise to me			1
from the first time i heard the story of his " miraculous " survival during the @entity35 era , i doubted that it could be true			2
@entity27 's claim that , as an inmate in a @entity40 sub-camp , he had survived because a young girl had tossed an apple over the fence each day for seven months just did not seem credible to me			0
the notion that a concentration camp inmate could approach the fence without the @entity47 shooting him beggared the imagination			0
i could not believe that a little girl whose family was supposedly passing as non-jews would allow their daughter to engage in such an act			0
the fairy tale nature of the incident was enhanced by the supposed reunion of the couple on a blind date years later when both had moved to @entity60			0
the story was that they discovered each other 's true identity and , after a whirlwind romance , decided to marry			2
survivors who had been in the camp with @entity68 and had kept in touch with him since the end of the war protested that the story could not be true			1
they wondered why @entity27 had never mentioned the incident until the late 1990s			0
a number of other historians shared my doubts , which i posted on my blog			2
as one of the first to express skepticism about this , i became the target of attacks from those who thought i was demeaning the @entity85			0
we doubters could not , however , initially overcome the power of @entity89 , on whose show @entity27 and his wife appeared twice			0
credulous reporters , who should have sought some form of verification , kept writing about this " miraculous " event			0
the producer who acquired movie rights tried to intimidate those of us who raised questions			1
he wrote to me saying , " i have traveled all over @entity100 for several years in preparation for what will be a major feature film			0
i may be more of a @entity6 expert than you , even though , i have no title nor university affiliation			1
what i do know for sure is before i make any statements i know the facts			0
you simply do not know those facts , and that @entity2 , is the greatest sin to the memory of all those perished so long ago			1
" the publisher refused to let anyone see the book			0
public relations people circulated versions of the story urging recipients to send it on so eventually it would reach millions of people			1
slowly , thanks to the power of the @entity129 and the work of some intrepid historians , the hoax was exposed			0
the publisher pulled the book			0
the movie producer cried foul , presenting himself as a victim who had been duped			0
this is not the first time such a hoax has been perpetrated			0
most of the previous stories have been spread by people who were passing as survivors			1
in contrast , the @entity85 were both survivors of the @entity6			1
but that fact has now been lost in the shuffle			0
what , then , is the danger of these sorts of hoaxes ? first of all , they give ammunition to @entity6 deniers			1
this is a bonanza for them			0
deniers expend great efforts in trying to implant doubts in young people about the veracity of the @entity6			1
they spend so much energy attacking " @entity162 : @entity163 " because it is a book that is widely read by young people			2
the fact that this " apples over the fence " story has already been published as a widely successful children 's story provides the deniers with a great opportunity to peddle their wares			1
however , the danger posed by deniers is not the primary reason why such fabricated stories should be exposed			2
the events of the @entity6 are horrible in and of themselves			1
they do not need to be aggrandized or exaggerated to be made to sound any worse than they were			0
they also do not need to be rendered as joyful love stories that make us feel good about what happened			2
both are insults to the survivors and inimical to the pursuit of historical truth			1
the optimum way of teaching about the @entity6 and presenting its history is , to quote detective @entity194 from the old tv show , " @entity196 , " " just the facts , just the facts			1
" what we need , particularly in relation to something as mind - boggling as the @entity6 , are " just the facts			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : people raised questions about @entity6 love story
she says *backers* of the story rejected the doubts
@entity2 says such tales give ammunition to @entity6 deniers
she also says the fake story insults the memory of the survivors
