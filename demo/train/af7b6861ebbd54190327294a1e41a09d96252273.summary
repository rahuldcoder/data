@entity0 -- @entity2 carries out mass surveillance of phone calls and e-mails in a program similar to the @entity8 one revealed by @entity8 leaker @entity9 , a @entity2 newspaper has claimed			1
the program is run by @entity2 's secret service , the @entity12 , and also is used by six other @entity2 intelligence services , national daily @entity14 alleged in a report late thursday			1
it says it is able to prove that the agency " systematically collects electromagnetic signals from computers or phones in @entity2 , and also collects flows between @entity2 and abroad : all our communications are spied on			2
" " all e-mails , sms , records of telephone calls , accesses to @entity30 , @entity31 , are then stored for years			1
" the newspaper 's report comes on the heels of wide @entity36 concern over the disclosures made by @entity9 , a former @entity39 contractor			1
@entity41 envoys meet over claims of @entity8 spying on @entity36 allies documents he 's leaked to the media have led to allegations that the @entity8 has been spying on its @entity36 allies as well as carrying out mass surveillance of telephone and internet traffic			1
but @entity14 claims the @entity2 government 's response has betrayed its conflicting interests			1
" if revelations on the @entity8 spying system ( @entity58 ) led to a chorus of indignation in @entity36 , @entity2 only showed weak signs of protest			1
for two excellent reasons : @entity0 already knew			0
and it does the same thing , " it said			0
@entity14 alleges that the @entity2 intelligence agencies ' use of this huge store of data is " on the margin of legality , and beyond serious control " and that politicians who are aware of it turn a blind eye			1
it cites a parliamentary intelligence committee report from april in which it was said that " since 2008 , progress has been made on the subject of sharing capacities , especially in the field of electromagnetic intelligence , led by the @entity12 for the profit of the intelligence community			0
" the @entity2 government has not yet responded to several requests from @entity1 for comment			2
at about the same time the allegations were published by @entity14 , @entity2 interior minister @entity87 gave a speech to guests at a july 4 celebration at the @entity92 in @entity0 in which he was critical of the alleged @entity8 spying on its allies			1
espionage has no place in relations between allied countries , said @entity87 , adding that they should depend on reciprocal confidence to maintain their alliance			0
the occasion of his remarks , as a guest of the @entity8 embassy , led some of his fellow countrymen to complain that he had overstepped proprieties			2
@entity87 declined to answer subsequent questions from reporters about the claims made in @entity14			0
@entity111 lawmaker @entity110 , a member of the governing @entity112 , questioned the accuracy of @entity14 's report in his blog friday , saying he did so " because intelligence matters do not easily accommodate fantasies and inaccuracies			2
" " while the legal framework concerning intelligence activities is indeed very incomplete , allowing our services to use wiretaps , the acquiring of technical data ... and limited access to files , the assertion that ' all of our communications are spied upon ( and ) stored for years ' does not quite match the reality that i know , " he wrote			0
@entity110 , who is president of the @entity111 's law commission and a member of a parliamentary intelligence committee , said that the tools used by services to intercept the internet communications of @entity2 citizens operate within a legal framework laid down in 1991			2
" @entity2 citizens are therefore not subject to uncontrolled , massive and constant espionage , " he wrote			0
@entity9 is believed to have been holed up at @entity142 's @entity141 since june 23 , having arrived there from @entity143			0
opinion : why we 're all stuck in the digital transit zone with @entity9 @entity1 's @entity147 reported from @entity0 , while @entity148 and @entity149 wrote and reported from @entity150			0
@entity1 's @entity151 also contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's secret service snoops on phone calls and e-mails , @entity14 says
e-mails , sms , phone call , @entity30 and @entity31 data are stored , it says
this *explains* @entity2 's " weak response " to reports of @entity8 spying on @entity36 , it says
