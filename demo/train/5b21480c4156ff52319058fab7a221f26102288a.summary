former @entity2 @entity1 leader @entity0 once again faces two genocide charges instead of one in his long - running trial over ethnic violence during the 1990s @entity7 wars			1
appellate judges at a @entity10 war crimes tribunal in the @entity11 on thursday reinstated the second genocide charge , ruling that the tribunal improperly dismissed the count in june 2012			1
@entity0 , whose trial began in 2010 , also faces nine other charges related to ethnic violence during the breakup of @entity19 in the 1990s			1
the reinstated charge accuses @entity0 of trying to permanently remove @entity2 muslims and @entity22 from parts of @entity2 in 1992			1
the charge was thrown out last year after the prosecution rested its case , with the tribunal ruling that there was n't enough evidence for a genocide conviction on that particular allegation			2
but the appellate judges thursday ruled that the evidence of serious abuse against @entity2 muslims and @entity22 -- including detaining them in overcrowded , squalid conditions where they were starved and left vulnerable to disease -- could be shown to be genocidal acts			2
the judges cited allegations that @entity0 and officials loyal to him decided on a plan to rid @entity2 of @entity21 , in part by killing a third of them and converting another third to @entity46			1
thursday 's decision came exactly 18 years after the notorious 1995 @entity49 massacre , for which @entity0 faces the other genocide charge			1
nearly 8,000 @entity21 men and boys were killed in the @entity2 town of @entity54 in july 1995			1
@entity54 became an emblem for the dissolution of @entity19 -- once a multiethnic state of @entity1 , @entity22 , @entity21 and others -- into six countries during a bloody and brutal conflict			1
on thursday , more than 400 victims of the massacre were to be reburied at a memorial center in @entity66 in @entity2 , adding to the more than 5,000 victims already buried there , the country 's state - run news agency @entity61 reported			2
victims of the massacre have been buried at the site periodically as officials locate and identify more victims in mass graves			0
" sadness and pain , i have no words			0
it is so hard , " said @entity79 , who was set to bury her son @entity80 at the site thursday , according to @entity61			0
" this is beyond any human comprehension what they did to us and what we are experiencing			0
" the 1992 - 95 @entity2 conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of @entity19			2
@entity0 was removed from power in 1995 , when the @entity94 that ended the @entity2 war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office			1
@entity0 was captured in 2008 after more than 13 years of hiding in plain sight in @entity100			0
he had adopted an elaborate disguise that included long hair and a full beard , and was practicing alternative medicine in the @entity1 capital			0
his former military commander , @entity106 , was captured in 2011 and is also on trial for charges including genocide			0
both men would face life in prison if convicted			0
the court can not impose the death penalty			0
@entity116 president @entity115 also faced charges connected with the @entity7 wars , but he died in 2006 while on trial at the @entity120 .			0

the reinstated count accuses @entity0 of trying to remove @entity21 from @entity2
he was the leader of the *breakaway* @entity125 in @entity2 in the 1990s
@entity0 , on trial since 2010 , also faces a charge of genocide over the @entity54 massacre
