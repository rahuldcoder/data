pro-democracy hong kongers have reacted angrily to a @entity2 government white paper affirming @entity4 's " comprehensive jurisdiction " over the territory , released days after more than 100,000 demonstrators gathered in the city calling for greater rights			1
the 14,500 - word document , which stresses that @entity10 does not have " full autonomy " and comes under @entity4 's oversight , was released amid fierce debate between residents of the former @entity16 colony over impending electoral reform and the nature of the " one country , two systems " concept			1
published by the @entity23 , the unprecedented white paper states that " many wrong views are currently rife in @entity10 " with regard to the " one country , two systems " principle that governs the territory 's relationship with @entity4			1
some residents are " confused or lopsided in their understanding " of the principle , it adds			0
" the high degree of autonomy of the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) is not full autonomy , nor a decentralized power , " said the paper			2
" it is the power to run local affairs as authorized by the central leadership			0
" @entity10 lawmaker @entity43 , leader of the pro-democracy @entity44 , said he was " completely taken aback " by the document , which had sent a shiver up ( his ) spine			0
" " it is a sea - change to our understanding of what ' one country , two systems ' should be , " he said			0
he argued that the notion that judicial decisions made in @entity10 should take into account the needs of @entity2 was a new concept , and one that was " totally repugnant to our understanding of the rule of law as an institution which we hold very dear to our hearts			2
" " i am surprised that my country could go back on the promises and undertakings that had brought about such a smooth reversion to @entity2 sovereignty , " he said			0
a warning to democrats ? many analysts view the release of the paper , the first official document since the 1997 handover to set out @entity4 's authority over the territory , as a warning to campaigners pushing for the introduction of universal suffrage by 2017 , when the city will choose its next chief executive			1
@entity85 , professor of political science at @entity87 , said the paper represented an attempt by @entity4 to shape the debate around electoral reform			1
" i think this is part of a campaign to warn @entity10 people that we have to accept the electoral system soon to be imposed on us , which probably will follow the proposal set out by pro-beijing groups , " he said			2
an article of @entity10 's @entity101 , which serves as the territory 's constitution , states as an eventual goal that the chief executive should be selected through universal suffrage			1
in 2007 , the @entity2 government settled on 2017 as the earliest that this may occur			2
but the prospect has proven controversial , with pan-democrat @entity109 wanting the general population to be able to choose its next chief executive without restrictions , and the city 's @entity114 politicians arguing that only candidates who " love @entity2 " should be eligible			1
currently , @entity10 's chief executive is chosen by a 1,200 - member committee , mainly composed of pro-beijing and business figures			1
@entity85 said the white paper 's main thrust was that , while @entity10 enjoyed a high degree of autonomy , @entity4 was ultimately in control , with @entity2 's interests and national security paramount			1
" the main point is that whatever power @entity10 has comes from the central government -- no more , " he said			2
" the emphasis is on @entity2 's state interests , @entity2 's sovereignty , on one country ahead of two systems			2
" mixed opinions @entity85 said the paper had been met with " concern , resentment , dissatisfaction			0
" " we are all concerned that if @entity4 chooses to deny giving @entity10 people a democratic electoral system , then the @entity145 ( special administrative region ) government will be seen to be illegitimate			1
" but @entity148 , an associate professor at @entity150 's department of economics , did not see a cause for alarm , saying @entity4 was sending a signal that it intended to be increasingly involved in @entity10 's political evolution while supporting economic growth			1
" it means that @entity10 will be relatively stable politically and ... ( the ) risk ( to ) the economy is reduced , " he said			0
" to the investors and businessmen in @entity10 , these signals are positive			0
" under the " one country , two systems " principle , @entity10 has been allowed to develop as a more liberal , capitalist city within socialist @entity2 -- the only place within @entity2 territory where large pro-democracy demonstrations are tolerated			2
still , many of its residents are worried that the city 's freedoms are steadily eroding , and @entity4 's efforts to draw the territory nearer are often resisted			0
in february , journalists organized a 6,500 - person rally decrying what they said were increasing levels of coercion against the @entity10 press , and last week , as many as 180,000 people turned out to a candelight vigil commemorating the 25th anniversary of the @entity186 massacre , according to organizers			0
@entity188 later this month , a pro-democracy group called @entity188 plans to hold an unofficial citywide referendum asking @entity10 's citizens to vote for their preferred type of electoral reform , a move that has irked the city 's @entity114 establishment			1
if the results show support for public nomination and elections , @entity188 says it will block traffic in @entity10 's crowded downtown to pressure the government to adopt its reforms			1
a january poll by the non-partisan @entity206 found 38 % of @entity109 supported @entity188 's proposed civil disobedience , while 54 % opposed it			0
@entity2 's vice president has warned that such a protest would be " unlawful " and would " wreck the stability and prosperity " of the city			0
on friday , the @entity213 reported that @entity4 was drafting a similar white paper on @entity215 -- the former @entity217 colony that is @entity2 's other @entity145			1
the newspaper quoted a researcher as saying the paper would cover similar ground to the @entity10 report , and address public order issues in the wake of recent protests in the territory			0

a @entity2 white paper affirming its control over @entity10 's affairs is proving controversial
it asserts the ultimate power rests with @entity4 , and national *considerations* are paramount
it comes amid debate on electoral reforms ahead of @entity10 's 2017 vote
campaigners are seeking universal suffrage ; others want only " *pro-china* " candidates
