-- @entity1 is often called the @entity2 in @entity3 , but now he 's also known as an @entity4 ( @entity4 )			1
he was awarded the honor from the @entity6 this week in recognition of his services to children with dyslexia and special educational needs			1
according to the @entity12 in @entity13 , he 's spent much of the last two years touring the @entity14 to educate about dyslexia and other learning difficulties			1
@entity1 , who was diagnosed with dyslexia as an adult , is also the author of 17 children 's books centered on @entity21 , a boy with dyslexia who overcomes his struggles at school and with bullies			1
there are two things i love about the press release : one , that " @entity31 " the show is never actually mentioned , although @entity33 sneaks in a reference ( " @entity1 is living proof that difficulties can be overcome and that for those suffering disability and self - doubt , happy days can nevertheless lie ahead " )			0
and two , the sense of formality that insures you will also not see the words " the @entity44 " or " @entity44 " ( " mr. @entity1 's portrayal of @entity44 garnered him two @entity46 and three @entity48 nominations " )			2
what i love about this in general is that it 's just another wonderful , unexpected line on @entity1 's @entity52 ©			2
it 's kinda like the first time you read that he was an executive producer on " macgyver " or heard that he saw the short film that " @entity66 " ... writer / director @entity59 had made about having suicidal thoughts after his high school girlfriend dumped him for the captain of the ski team and gave him an office so he could write it as a feature			0
it 's easy to just think of @entity1 as " @entity44 " instead of as a man who 's also done multiple @entity70 movies , " @entity71 , " and " @entity72 " among other things ( like wear orange shirts on " @entity75 " )			2
every now and then we like to stop and remember			0
