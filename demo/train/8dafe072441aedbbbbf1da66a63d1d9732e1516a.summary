-- a couple of years ago , my daughter and i were playing the classic board game " life , " and her little car reached the roadblock at which everybody -- absolutely everybody -- gets married			1
needless to say , given a new set of striking statistics last week that showed a record low of 51 % of @entity14 adults are married , " life " was designed many decades ago			1
the study by the @entity17 further found that 40 % of births these days are to unmarried mothers , and a similar percentage of @entity14 say marriage is becoming obsolete			1
my daughter @entity22 , who was 8 when we were playing the board game , tossed off this remark as she stuck the tiny blue husband pin into her car : " when i grow up , i do n't think i 'll get married			1
i think i 'll just get some sperm			2
" how we reap what we sow ! @entity22 was old enough to know the story of her own origins , and it goes like this : when i turned 39 , still single , i resolved to become a mother on my own and bought eight vials of donor sperm			1
but then i met her father , @entity37 , and he agreed to help me have a baby the old - fashioned way			1
we went through many ups and downs , even splitting up for a couple of years , but finally realized that we loved each other , got back together and went on to have her baby brother			1
when @entity22 was almost 4 , we got married			2
so there i was -- the former single mother by choice , the typical @entity48 type who deeply believes that there are a hundred great ways to make a family and that life can also be wonderful without one -- and i found myself responding to my daughter : " that would be fine if you just get some sperm , sweetheart , but you know , being married is actually really nice , too			1
" what happened to me ? what happened to the independent woman who , by the time she married for the first time at age 44 , felt no particular need for a piece of paper from @entity69 ? it is this			2
day in and out , through lunch - packing and play date - making and bath - running , i am struck by a surprising truth : though the raising of our children constitutes the central activity of our family , it is the love between @entity80 and me that constitutes its ineffable core			0
that sounds like a traditional religious point of view , but we are not religious			0
i 've come to this understanding simply as an observer of my own heart and the family dance			0
it is , apparently , just an emotional fact of life -- at least , of our life			2
what baffles me is that i was perfectly able to have @entity22 without being in a committed , loving relationship with @entity37 , and our semi-family life was really quite happy in that formation			0
we all got along ; @entity37 would visit two or three times a week ; @entity22 got plenty of love and structure			0
but since he and i reunited , our bond has become the family 's invisible center , the axis of its spokes			0
i did not need a husband			0
@entity107 : love and marriage are not the same thing so fine , but what difference do the formal " bonds of matrimony " make ? usually you hear people talk about commitment , but i ca n't imagine any greater commitment than sharing children who are still going to need raising for quite a few years			1
no , what marriage means to me is acceptance , an " absolute yes " that makes it bearable to be seen at your worst -- exhausted or flu - ridden or carried away by an ugly bout of selfishness			0
that " yes " launches the creation of an entity , a union , that exists apart from the daily ebb and flow of difficulties and joys			0
it is nothing but an abstraction , but , to my amazement , it is the most beautiful thing in our lives			0
so this is my marital equivalent of " yes , @entity141 , there is a @entity139 " : " yes , @entity22 , you can definitely stay single and you 'll have loads of company			1
you by no means have to get married			0
you can definitely have a fabulous life without marriage , and it would certainly be a huge mistake to rush into anything			2
" but i can not lie : i wish you all that is best in life , and marriage , when it 's good , can be one of those things			1
and if you do get married , at your wedding i 'll cry tears of joy -- because i 'll know that you 're about to enter the gates of one of the most magical places in the world			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			2

@entity165 says study shows marriage statistics down but rate of unmarried moms up
she says she *'d* bought sperm to have baby , then met man who agreed to *reproduce* with her
she says they had ups , downs , split , got back together , had another baby and got married
@entity165 tells her daughter : it 's fine to stay single , but marriage is one of the best things in life
