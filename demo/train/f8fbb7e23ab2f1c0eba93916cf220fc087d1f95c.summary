@entity0 -- terror attacks have spiked dramatically in @entity3 and @entity4 as extremists in both countries strengthen their power and expand operations , according to a @entity10 report released thursday			1
the number of terrorist attacks in @entity4 , like this bombing in april , has more than quadrupled from 2006 to 2008			1
but the @entity10 annual terrorism report notes an overall decline in attacks worldwide and fewer attacks in @entity18			1
the attacks worldwide have decreased by 20 percent , with 30 percent fewer fatalities , said @entity21 of the @entity22			1
the report says @entity24 and its extremist supporters have moved across the @entity3 border " to the remote areas of the @entity4 frontier , where they have used this terrain as a safe haven to hide , train terrorists , communicate with the followers , plot attacks and send fighters to support the insurgency in @entity3			1
" in @entity4 alone , the report says , attacks more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2008 , with a sharp increase in their " coordination , sophistication and frequency			1
" last year there were 1,839 terrorist " incidents , " compared with 890 in 2007 , @entity21 said			0
the rise in violence has complicated the @entity49 administration 's effort to implement its strategy of boosting military and civilian programs in both countries			0
the report says the largest number of attacks occurred in @entity4 provinces near the @entity3 border , including @entity57 , the @entity58 and the @entity59 , where extremists have sought to challenge the government and extend @entity63 law			1
it also notes the government 's inability to get a handle on the extremists			0
despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces , it says , " the government of @entity4 's authority in the area continued to be challenged			2
" @entity72 , the @entity10 's acting coordinator of counterterrorism , told reporters the @entity49 administration has " real concerns " that @entity24 's senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the @entity80			1
" we have a real sense that it 's happening , but we have imperfect knowledge of what they 're doing , " he said			0
@entity4 's military in the past week launched an assault on militants in @entity91 - held areas after they seized territory in violation of an agreement signed this year by @entity4 president @entity95			2
the deal , criticized by the @entity80 , allowed the @entity91 to implement @entity63 law , or sharia , in the region in exchange for an end to fighting			0
the recent operations are part of the @entity4 army 's intensified drive against the @entity91 in its restive tribal regions			0
the @entity4 government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with @entity3			1
as a result , the @entity80 military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in @entity4			0
the strikes have rankled relations between the two countries			0
@entity4 has asked the @entity80 to supply its forces with helicopters , communication equipment and night - vision technology as part of a @entity80 plan to beef up the country 's counterterrorism efforts			0
president @entity49 told reporters wednesday night that he is " gravely concerned about the situation in @entity4			0
" speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office , @entity49 said the @entity80 has " huge national security interests in making sure that @entity4 is stable " and does n't end up a " nuclear - armed militant state			1
" after making two visits to @entity4 in less than three weeks , adm. @entity132 , chairman of the @entity133 , is " very alarmed by the growing extremist threat in @entity4 and remains frustrated particularly by the political leaderships ' inability to confront that threat , " according to his chief spokesman			1
secretary of state @entity140 and defense secretary @entity141 have called @entity91 gains in @entity4 an " existential threat " to the country			2
the @entity10 report notes the terrorist attacks in @entity147 , @entity148 , in november , attributing them to the @entity4 - based @entity150 terrorist group @entity149 and to its fundraising subsidiary , amaat @entity152			1
although @entity4 has cracked down on some of the groups ' camps and made several arrests , the report warned of continuing tension between @entity148 and @entity4			2
the report says @entity3 is plagued by " an insurgency that more and more relied on vicious and increasingly sophisticated terrorist attacks , " despite the efforts of @entity161 forces and the @entity3 government			1
" the anti-government insurgency remained a capable , determined and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority , " the report warns			0
although the @entity91 continued to suffer heavy combat loses , the report says its ability to leverage support from @entity24 and recruit soldiers " remained undiminished			1
" " @entity91 information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated , " it says			0
" streams of @entity91 financing from across the border in @entity4 , along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking , have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities			2
" @entity182 is also a source of training to the @entity91 " on small - unit tactics , small arms , explosives and indirect - fire weapons , " the report says			2
" since at least 2006 , @entity182 has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition , rocket - propelled grenades , mortar rounds , 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select @entity91 members , " it says			2
while terrorists in @entity18 still launched attacks last year , " there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country , including a decrease in civilian casualties , enemy attacks , and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year , " the report says			1
there were 3,258 terrorist incidents in 2008 , down almost half from the 6,210 attacks in 2007 , @entity21 said			0
he added there was a decrease during the first quarter of 2009 , although there has a been a spike in terrorist attacks in april			0
although the threat from @entity228 " continued to diminish " due to significant defections and a loss of both territory and funding , @entity24 continued to benefit from safe haven in @entity220 and has strengthened its @entity222 operations , the report says			2
it notes a sharp increase in attacks by @entity24 affiliates in @entity222			1
in @entity234 , many of the attacks were blamed on @entity235 , whose tactics " appeared to be influenced by [ @entity24 's ] experience in @entity18			1
" the report also warns " the security situation in @entity240 continued to deteriorate during 2008 and was marked by a series of attacks against both @entity244 and @entity240 interests , " culminating in the september 17 suicide bombing of the @entity246 in @entity247 that killed 18			2
" @entity248 in @entity240 ( @entity249 ) remained strong , and the use of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices ( @entity253 ) and suicide vests indicated a high level of training , coordination , and sophistication by @entity240 's terrorist leadership , " the report says			0
the report calls the government 's response to the terrorist threat " intermittent and its ability to pursue and prosecute suspected terrorists remained weak due to a number of shortcomings , including stalled draft counterterrorism legislation			0
" although a raid in august on an @entity24 in @entity240 cell in the country uncovered large number of weapons , the report warns the action " did little to deter or disrupt other @entity249 cells			2
" it was a month later that at least seven assailants dressed in @entity240 security - service uniforms attacked the @entity80 embassy with explosives and suicide vests , launching what the report calls a " sophisticated and well - coordinated " attack			0
the report says @entity182 " remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism , " including supporting terrorist groups such as @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 , all of which opposed the @entity291 peace process , as well as @entity18 - based militants and the @entity91 fighters in @entity3			1
it cites the @entity294 , an elite branch of the @entity295 , as the regime 's " primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad			0
" " @entity182 's involvement in the planning and financial support of terrorist attacks throughout the @entity291 , @entity303 and @entity304 had a direct impact on international efforts to promote peace , threatened economic stability in the @entity309 , and undermined the growth of democracy , " the report says			1
@entity72 also said that the @entity80 is " troubled by indications that the @entity182 may be seeking to extend their influence into other parts of the world and expand its military ties into @entity317			0
" the @entity49 administration has adopted a policy of engagement with @entity182 in an effort to curb its nuclear ambitions .			0
