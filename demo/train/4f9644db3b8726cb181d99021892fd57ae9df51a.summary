@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 solo round - the - world sailor @entity3 happily admits that you need to be a little bit ' mad ' to take on long - distance sailing			1
@entity3 celebrates completing the solo @entity9 race earlier this year			1
and she should know : @entity3 became the first woman to sail single - handedly around the world in both directions after completing the solo round - the - world race , @entity9 , earlier this year			1
" people say you must be mad -- and there probably is an element of truth in that , " the 36 year - old told @entity2			1
growing up on the south coast of @entity0 , @entity3 was bitten by the sailing bug early and her passion for the sport led her to enter the @entity9 , considered by some to be the most punishing sporting event on the planet			1
@entity3 spent 99 days at sea completely alone and says preparation is the key to success in long - distance voyages at sea			1
that , and the desire and self - belief to make it to the finish			1
" you have to have this desire to see how far you can push yourself			2
it 's having the willingness to put yourself in that uncomfortable position -- and belief that you have the strength to get through it			1
" it 's a perceived risk and you go out there knowing that you have done all you can to deal with all scenarios			2
you do n't just go out there on a whim -- we are well trained , " she said			0
coping day - to - day during the journey is a whole new challenge : solo sailors must battle perilous conditions , changes to sleep patterns and , inevitably , loneliness			1
would you survive a round the world voyage ? take our personality test and find out ! @entity3 says she found being separated from family and friends was the hardest aspect of sailing round - the - world the first time			1
" the toughest thing about my first journey was not seeing people for six months			0
you can communicate very well now , perhaps too well , but it still does n't allow you to have face - to - face contact with people			2
" modern - day communications allow sailors to keep in touch via satellite phones and also keep in internet contact			2
sailors are tracked by global positioning systems ( gps ) and also receive regular weather information			0
" transition " periods at the start or just after the end of voyages -- when sailors are adjusting to boat routines or getting reacquainting with daily life -- are also very challenging			0
exhaustion while getting used to different sleep patterns was particularly difficult : on board , @entity3 would generally sleep in short bursts of two or three hours depending on conditions			1
the amount of sleep could vary greatly from day - to - day			1
" the transitions are difficult			0
life on board is very disciplined			0
your adjustment with new sleeping patterns takes about two to three weeks			0
if it 's changeable weather when you 're out there , you do n't stand a hope of getting sleep			1
" it 's a major shock to the body when you get back too			2
suddenly you are supposed to get all your sleep at once -- and you actually have a night and a day , " she said			2
food is also an issue for sailors spending a long time at sea			0
it needs to keep for a long time and take up minimal space , which means meals can be monotonous -- freeze - dried pasta or rice - based dishes made by adding hot water			2
cravings are not unusual , according to @entity3			1
" thankfully the product has improved			0
i just get bored of eating the same type of food			0
you are aware you have n't had fresh produce in a long time and you start to crave it			0
" despite the hardships , @entity3 says there are numerous benefits			2
" it 's an amazing environment			0
every time you go out you are going to see something different -- but you ca n't always prepare for how hostile the environment may be			0
" i 'm not a gadget person , so i quite enjoy the basics of life			0
i really value my time now			0
and in a team scenario it can be particularly rewarding , as the ability to not only push one 's own limits but also to push other people 's limits is important , " she said			0
the intrepid @entity3 is ready to push her limits once again -- this time sailing around @entity4 and @entity151			1

lack of sleep and loneliness are the main challenges , according to @entity3
desire , preparation and self - belief are the keys to success , @entity3 says
