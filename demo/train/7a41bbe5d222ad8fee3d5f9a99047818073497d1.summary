-- prime minister @entity1 says he has won @entity3 's presidential election , restoring the former @entity5 officer to the office he held for eight years before term limits forced him to step down in 2008			1
@entity1 won 63 % of the votes with more than 99 % of the vote counted in an election whose outcome was never in doubt , according to monitors and activists			2
" the point of an election is that the outcome should be uncertain			0
this was not the case in @entity3 , " the @entity19 said monday , while urging @entity3 to hold fair elections			2
opposition activist and former chess champion @entity23 also accused @entity1 's supporters of " massive fraud " early monday by packing the polls with additional voters			1
while @entity1 's victory seems certain , it is less clear what his return to @entity3 's most powerful office means for the country and its relationship with the world			1
what next for @entity3 's opposition ? @entity3 opposition leaders predict a massive escalation in their campaign following @entity1 's announcement of his latest election victory , and @entity3 security forces broke up a planned @entity45 protest in central @entity46 on monday evening			1
outspoken opposition leader @entity47 , who once branded @entity1 's @entity48 as " the party of crooks and thieves , " told @entity0 before the election : " you have to put pressure on government until they give us back the things they 've stolen from us			1
" in pictures : how @entity1 cultivated strongman image organizers of the protest movement are trying to maintain the momentum they have built up since december , when reports of fraud during parliamentary elections sent tens of thousands of @entity3 into the streets of @entity46 to challenge @entity1 's leadership and demand democratic reforms -- the largest demonstrations in two decades , according to analysts and political observers			1
another opposition leader wants anti-putin protests to become a fact of daily life in @entity46			2
" after his supposed inauguration in may , i think we will have a camp in @entity46 , and the protests will become permanent , " @entity77 told @entity0			0
" our objective is to bar him from taking the oath			0
" can @entity1 govern the same way he did before ? while @entity1 warned during the election campaign that @entity86 would look a lot like @entity88 , expert @entity84 says there is significant political change on the horizon in @entity3			1
" times have changed , and he can not go back to the old style of governing , " said @entity84 , an associate fellow of the @entity3 and @entity92 at @entity94 - based think - tank @entity93			1
" and the fact he 's confirmed he 'll have @entity99 as prime minister suggests that he will not reverse the liberalizing reforms announced on december 22			1
" in an attempt to address the popular discontent following parliamentary elections in december , @entity99 proposed that @entity3 return to direct elections of regional governors , simplify the registration of political parties and presidential candidates , and establish a new editorially - independent national public tv channel			2
he also announced a number of new anti-corruption measures and called for the redistribution of power and financial resources from the federal government to local governments across the country			0
@entity84 says @entity1 is a pragmatist at heart and that enacting reforms will actually benefit the president - elect in the long run			1
" the old system was stifling and ultimately it delegitimized @entity1 's rule , " said @entity84			2
" but the new measures will be adopted , and all of them are absolutely fundamental truthful changes that will change the whole dynamic of contemporary @entity3 politics			2
" what does it mean for the average @entity3 ? post-election @entity3 will look remarkably similar to pre-election @entity3 , according to @entity0 's @entity134 , because @entity1 was already pulling most of the strings during @entity99 's four - year presidency			1
" @entity1 , in a sense , never left			2
@entity1 was running the government and the economy on a day to day basis , " @entity134 writes			2
" while he had ceded the presidency , and therefore foreign policy , to @entity99 , it was really a charade -- @entity1 was behind most of the most important decisions anyway			0
" for all of the flaws of the election , @entity84 says it is important to remember that @entity1 remains genuinely popular with a large segment of the @entity3 population			1
" there 's still a sense that he can deliver those public goods , " @entity84 told @entity0 on monday			0
" and while a @entity1 government has its downsides -- the stifling of small businesses , the weakness of the rule of law , the stifling media environment -- i think that 's going to open up			0
" " it has to be a major push to ensure to protect the rights of property and limit collusion , because otherwise the economy will maintain its lack of diversity and competitiveness , " said @entity84			0
the @entity3 economy is primarily based on natural resources including oil and natural gas , and @entity134 believes there is little advantage for the @entity1 regime in seeing that change , adding : " the more you diversify , the more prospect there is for losing political control			1
" what does it mean for @entity3 's relationship with the @entity186 ? @entity1 's official return to the helm comes at a time where @entity3 has found itself at odds with much of the western world due to its support for @entity194 's regime in @entity195 and its rejection of further @entity198 and @entity199 sanctions against @entity200 for its nuclear activities -- and @entity84 does n't expect that to change anytime soon			2
" it 's going to be a very bumpy and tough time -- @entity1 is not going to be anyone 's patsy over @entity195 , over @entity200 , or anything else , " he told @entity0			0
" we look as if we 're gearing up for lots of difficult political discussions over the future of the @entity209			0
" while the @entity186 has long tried to delegitimize his policies and regime , @entity84 says @entity1 has always been careful not to let @entity3 become a new @entity213 - style anti-western bloc			1
" it 's going to be a lot of tough talking ... but in recent documents @entity1 has shown what he did when he first came to power -- a very strong @entity220 tendency , " @entity84 said			0
" we see the relationship now with the @entity199 is in the doldrums , and i would anticipate an attempt to revive and rejuvenate that relationship			0
" how long can @entity1 hold onto power ? @entity1 's win in this election means he could potentially complete two more terms as @entity3 president before being required by law to step down again in 2024 -- potentially bringing his time as @entity3 president and prime minister to a total 24 years , just short of the record held by @entity213 dictator @entity234			1
whether @entity1 stays on as president for two more terms is largely down to whether he can make changes demanded by a @entity3 population that is gradually growing weary of his rule , according to @entity84			1
" i think there is a clear sense that @entity1 has outstayed his welcome , " said @entity84			0
" but he 'll make it through this term if he puts himself at the head of a gradual evolutionary reform movement			0
" whether @entity1 can reform remains to be seen , but @entity84 says he is n't going anywhere for now			0
" barring a catastrophe , @entity1 's going to serve six years , so we have just have to get used to working with him again			0
" the @entity251 , @entity0 's @entity252 and @entity134 contributed to this report .			0
