-- beautiful stretches of desert , wispy cumulus clouds , green - chile cheeseburgers and cozy adobe homes			2
these are the hallmarks of @entity7 , @entity8			1
but now , thanks to the @entity11 hit series " @entity13 , " the fictional saga about a high school chemistry teacher turned drug dealer , there are some new , more unusual trademarks			1
the wildly popular , emmy - winning television series shot in @entity7 tells the story of mild - mannered @entity20 , played by @entity21 , who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer early in the show			1
he turns to producing and selling methamphetamine to secure his family 's financial future before he dies			2
his radical transformation into a ruthless drug baron has spawned a cult - like following ( fans are even getting @entity20 tattoos )			2
as a result of the show 's success , many businesses in @entity7 are getting creative and prompting visitors to check out spots that were not on the must - see list before 2008 when the series began			1
how ' @entity13 ' should end the final season starts on august 11 , so why not pretend to cook up some crystal meth in @entity7 to mark the occasion ? take a @entity44 : @entity45 this is not your typical jaunt around town			1
for starters , the open - air trolleys are covered in stucco to represent the adobe - style buildings of the area			2
it 's called the @entity58 tour , but , in fact , it 's so good that it sells out months in advance			1
the three - and - a - half - hour tour is run by two locals who clearly love showing people around @entity20 and @entity65 's @entity7			1
riders on this tour cover nearly 40 miles worth of " @entity13 " hangouts			1
plus , there are flat screens in the trolley playing scenes from the show that coincide with the tour stops			1
altogether , guests see up to 20 locations from all five seasons , including the exteriors of @entity79 's house , @entity65 's house , @entity81 , the car wash and @entity84 's hideout			1
boost your cooking cred : @entity87 if you 're looking for something highly unusual to do on your @entity7 vacation , pretending to cook up crystal meth would be it			1
during an interactive 60 - minute " cooking " class at eco-friendly day - spa @entity87 you 'll learn secrets from the @entity96			2
in other words , you 'll be whipping up blue sheet candy and blue bath salts , both inspired by @entity20 's pure crystal meth			1
by the end of the class you will be a certified @entity102 , and to prove it , they 'll take your mug shot holding your certificate			2
and better yet , you get to walk away with the evidence , in 8 - ounce plastic baggies , of course			2
after you 're finished cooking , try the 40 - minute @entity110 where your lucky limbs are exfoliated with all - natural ingredients and rehydrated with the @entity114 lotion			1
two wheel it : @entity116 hop on a signature , yellow - tire three - speed cruiser to explore urban @entity45 by bike			1
upon arrival @entity120 guests are " booked " ( given special markings for the tour ) and outfitted with bicycles			0
then , the first person to answer the initial trivia question correctly draws from a set of five character cards			0
this determines the tour route			0
depending on what tour you are on , you might visit @entity134 's house , see where @entity135 spent his last minutes , visit the @entity137 building , ride through the neighborhood where @entity65 grew up and discover @entity84 's headquarters			1
no worries if you are n't a cycling pro ; the tour is intended for riders of all skill levels with mostly level terrain			0
eat @entity147 : @entity148 and @entity149 on the show it 's called @entity81 and serves as home base for meth kingpin @entity81			1
in reality it 's @entity156 and does n't actually serve chicken			0
instead , grab a root beer float and a plate of @entity147 food			0
inside you 'll find a @entity81 mural , which makes for a recognizable photo op. choose from burgers and burritos and lots of toppings			2
the signature item , the @entity169 , comes with chicken , beef , carne adovada or bean and cheese topped with red or green chile , lettuce and tomato			0
@entity178 chow down , check out the guest book and sign in next to fellow fans visiting from places like @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184			0
down a dog : @entity186 you know you 've arrived at @entity186 when you see a giant neon dachshund sign perched atop a tiny shack off of @entity192			0
" @entity13 " fans will recognize it as a place that @entity65 visits several times on the show			1
for nearly 60 years , this relic of an eatery has been serving up burgers , tater tots , foot - long chili cheese dogs and @entity203 pies ( @entity205 chips piled with seasoned ground beef and red chili , cheese , tomatoes and onions			0
) be warned , though : some of the dishes have a kick			0
satisfy your sweet tooth : the @entity215 fans love this candy shop located in the historic part of town for a few reasons			1
first of all , you can purchase a $ 1 baggie of @entity222			0
it 's so popular , @entity224 , @entity225 , has sold 30,000 of them to customers around the world in places as far flung as @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity183			0
in fact , she supplied the show with the prop meth during the first two seasons			1
while you 're at the shop , try on a @entity239 pork pie hat or snag an " i 'm not @entity239 " t - shirt			0
you 'll also find red - and - green chili fudge and x-rated candy ( aka chocolate in the shape of unmentionable body parts )			2
be a rebel : @entity248 stuff yourself silly at this hometown doughnut shop			0
keep with the " @entity13 " theme by devouring a vanilla cake doughnut with light blue , cotton - candy - flavored icing topped with blue rock candy			1
actor @entity257 ( @entity65 ) custom ordered these awhile back and ever since @entity260 doughnuts have been flying off the shelves			0
other crowd - pleasers include maple bacon bars , green - chili apple fritters and doughnuts topped with @entity266			0
if those do n't float your boat , order custom - made doughnuts to your liking			0
they 've done " @entity277 " doughnuts splattered with red icing , " @entity274 " doughnuts and even gender reveal doughnuts for baby showers			0
get your brew on : @entity281 cheers ! on august 8 @entity281 is introducing two new beers just in time for the final season 's premiere			0
@entity239 's @entity286 , a 6.5 % @entity287 , represents @entity20 's dark side while @entity79 's @entity289 , an @entity291 @entity290 , represents his family man side			0
@entity293 plans to brew about 60 kegs of each style of beer , so there should be plenty to go around			0
the new themed beers will be on tap through @entity281 's distribution network in @entity8 , @entity301 and @entity302			1
@entity281 's beers have had cameos on the show several times and members of the cast have visited the brewery , too .			2

@entity45 offers a *3.5* hour , 40 - mile tour of " @entity13 " haunts
the @entity81 restaurant is really named @entity316
the @entity215 , who used to supply the show 's prop meth , sells breaking *bad* candy
