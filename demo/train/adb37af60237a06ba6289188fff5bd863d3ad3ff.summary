@entity0 -- @entity2 has been going to the @entity3 every day it has met since june 11 so there would be no chance she would miss the health care law ruling			1
@entity2 is director of the small business legal center of the @entity9 , one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that seeks to strike down the law			2
she and her group have worked through all of the possibilities and are ready to react to the court 's ruling immediately			1
" we have done a lot of work on that because we think that is critical			0
we are in the 24 - hour media cycle			0
the reporting will start immediately , " she told @entity1			0
@entity26 of @entity27 , one of the major groups promoting the health care initiative , brought activists from a dozen key states to @entity0 last week to help plan the various messages and reaction plans for each of the possible scenarios depending on how the court rules			1
" over the numerous weeks , we knew different possibilities could occur , " @entity26 told @entity1			0
" most of our focus is on what happens if the statute is upheld or partially upheld : where do we go from here and what do we want the public to understand ? " since @entity47 took office , no other political issue has generated as much debate , tension and argument than health care reform and the government 's role			1
various constituencies -- the @entity55 , @entity56 and a myriad of interest groups on all sides -- anxiously wait for the nation 's high court to hand down its decision on one of the most divisive political issues it has taken up in many years			1
@entity56 ready for decision -- then it gets tricky their task has been complicated by a great deal of uncertainty : how many rulings will there actually be since the justices are considering several different aspects of the @entity75 ? will the court decide to deal with the controversial individual mandate , which requires most citizens to buy health care insurance , separately than the rest of the law ? some interest groups have differing statements ready for seven or eight scenarios			1
many of the groups will either be at the court on thursday or race there so they can go to the cameras staked outside			1
the big four issues : what the justices are tackling one coalition of labor and health care reform advocates already sent reporters an e-mail saying they 'll hold a conference call at 12:30 p.m. on whatever day the ruling comes with the call - in number			0
@entity47 has the most at stake politically because the health care law is considered to be his signature domestic political achievement			1
a ruling by the court that all or part of the law is unconstitutional would be a black mark on his administration			1
no president wants to see his signature achievements overturned , said @entity112 , a former senior adviser in @entity113 's @entity55 and now an adviser to the pro-obama super @entity115 as well as a @entity1 contributor			1
the @entity55 has steadfastly refused to speculate about what will happen if the law is struck down			1
however , @entity119 , a senior @entity55 adviser , said over the weekend at the @entity121 convention that the administration is prepared for whatever the court does			1
she admitted the @entity55 and @entity125 congressional allies had been outmaneuvered as the issue was being debated			1
" the opponents of it outorganized -- in terms of the ' death panels ' -- and distorted what we were doing early on , " she said , referring to some opponents ' assertion that the new law contained a provision that would have bureaucrats decide who would or would n't be treated			2
the @entity3 health care decision will again put the issue front and center for presumptive @entity143 presidential nominee @entity142 , who included the individual mandate as part of the health care overhaul he pushed while governor of @entity148 but has said he does not favor the requirement on a national scale			2
" regardless of what they do , it 's going to be up to the next president to either repeal and replace @entity75 or to replace @entity75			2
and i intend to do both , if i 'm the president at a time when the @entity3 has left @entity75 in place , i will repeal it on day one by sending out a waiver to all 50 states to keep them from having to pursue @entity75 , " the presumptive @entity143 nominee said earlier this month in @entity157 , @entity158			2
while @entity142 would make the states responsible for helping the uninsured , he has said he would make sure to keep some of the more popular provisions of the health care overhaul , such as making sure people are n't dropped from coverage if they have a pre-existing condition			0
your bottom line : pre-existing conditions @entity142 's campaign staff has been meeting with members of @entity56 on how they will react , with the @entity178 helping to prepare			0
house speaker @entity179 said in a memo to @entity181 last week that " if the court strikes down all or part of the president 's health care law , there will be no spiking of the ball			1
" he said the emphasis will still be on the economy			0
" we will not celebrate at a time when millions of our fellow @entity194 are out of work			0
" no matter the decision , analysts on both sides predict there will be political repercussions that could have a major effect on both presidential campaigns in trying to motivate their bases			2
if the court upholds the law , that could fire up @entity142 's supporters			1
" it is odd -- if you lose substantively , you might win politically , " @entity112 said			2
if the mandate or entire bill is ruled unconstitutional , then the president 's base could get motivated			2
" @entity125 activists are very cynical about the @entity3 , " @entity112 added			0
overturning the law could take away a strong motivator for @entity142 , some analysts have noted , but the president would get the political black eye			1
a health care ' @entity221 ' recounts his conversion " it is going to be the gift that keeps giving , " said one @entity143 consultant			0
" what we are seeing with independent voters they are unhappy , disenchanted with @entity47			1
this would just reinforce that			0
" the problem for both parties is trying to decipher what exactly the public wants on this complex and emotional issue that affects most @entity194			0
a @entity1 / @entity238 poll conducted last month showed 51 % of @entity194 surveyed oppose the law -- most of them because they think it goes too far but some who feel it does n't go far enough -- while 43 % favor it			2
however , a recent @entity244 poll found a majority would not be happy with any of the possible scenarios that analysts believe are likely to come from the court			1
when asked if they would be happy or unhappy depending on how the court might rule , 44 % said they would be happy if the entire bill is thrown out ; 40 % would be happy if just the individual mandate alone is discarded ; and 39 % would be happy if the entire law is upheld			1
despite the massive protests and attention paid to the issue , the @entity194 people do n't really understand what is contained in the law -- a sign the @entity55 has not done a good job of messaging			1
some 49 % in the @entity244 survey said they understand the law somewhat well , 31 % said they understand it not too well or not well at all and only 18 % said they understand it very well			2
according to analysis by @entity1 's ad - tracking service @entity274 / @entity273 , those opposing @entity75 outspent proponents by a 3 - 1 margin -- $ 235 million to $ 69 million -- from march 23 , 2010 , when the law was signed , through june 17			2
what to know about health care reform some democrats privately acknowledge they have not done a good job of articulating their message			0
it 's one reason that as they prepare for whatever comes out of the court , they are ready to trumpet some of the act 's accomplishments so far			1
@entity125 members of @entity56 have been given small cards touting such facts as : 6.6 million young adults up to age 26 have health insurance through their parents ' plan ; up to 17 million children with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage ; 54 million @entity194 with private insurance have received one or more free preventive service and 5.1 million seniors saved $ 3.2 billion on prescription drugs			0
conservatives have pounced on the uncertainties of the law as well as government overreach in its opposition			2
@entity308 , for example , last week went up with a $ 6 million ad in six key electoral states ( @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317 ) and national cable with a doctor saying : " the truth is , we still do n't know how much this law will eventually cost			0
i do n't want anything to come between my patients and me -- especially @entity0 bureaucrats			0
" as for the insurers , they have been running what they call an aggressive education campaign to try to sell what it calls an " inextricable link " between market reforms and the coverage requirement			0
the insurers ' trade group , @entity336 ( @entity336 ) , argues that to afford the changes , the companies need a larger insurance pool that comes with the mandate			0
if not , then consumers could be facing larger premiums			0
also in a pre-emptive move , several major insurers , including @entity345 , @entity346 and @entity347 , have announced they will allow children of their clients to stay on until they are 26 even if the law is thrown out			0
" we are ready for whatever the court decides			1
we will have a lot more when the court announces , " said @entity336 spokesman @entity353			0
