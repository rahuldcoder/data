-- why did @entity1 fall off @entity3 's radar shortly after the 2009 release of @entity5 : the rise of @entity7 ? the answer 's simple , according to @entity1 herself : " i sabotaged things , " she says			1
" i burnt a lot of bridges			1
" there 's more blunt honesty where that came from in @entity1 's big @entity19 @entity18 interview , the magazine 's latest cover story			1
( and yes , the article also includes a very tasteful , black - and - white topless photoshoot			2
) in between a fair amount of purple prose ( " [ we ] talked to each other , and at each other , and occasionally over each other about feminism and social media and the press and public morality and twerking , obviously ... some of this into my voice recorder , some of it into the wind " ) , @entity1 gives a lot of insight into her rocky career , which started to slump when her private life became more interesting than her professional life — and @entity1 freely admits that she 's got nobody to blame for that but herself			1
( although according to interviewer @entity50 , @entity1 does concede " that she certainly would n't have been treated in this way were she a man			1
" maybe there 's a @entity55 comparison to be made here ? ) the trouble began when 2004 ′ s @entity58 remake was released — and 22 - year - old @entity1 suddenly skyrocketed to fame , due to her roles as both the film 's costar and @entity64 's girlfriend			1
" i was really naive , " she recalls to @entity50			2
" not green as grass — i was by no means an innocent — but i had faith in the goodness of everyone			2
and that led me into all sorts of situations that backfired			2
" namely , @entity1 never really learned how to play the pr game : " i was @entity73			1
i was , ' let 's be who we are ! i 'm not going to have my hair done every morning and yes : i smell of fags ! ' and so i would walk into studio heads ' offices and we 'd crack up laughing			2
" and while she claims that she was always " totally professional " on movie sets , offset , the actress " had no business sense whatsoever " : " i never read a review or paid any mind to what anyone said , " @entity1 admits			1
she also ruffled feathers with her off - the - cuff remarks , as when she memorably called @entity93 's second - largest city " @entity94 -- sburgh			0
" and of course , she got caught in one tabloid scandal after another , first due to her tumultuous relationship with @entity64 and later when she had an affair with the married actor @entity100			0
as a result , @entity1 says roles dried up — because " people do n't want to see films with people they do n't approve of in them			1
" ( you know , unless they 're men			0
) so @entity1 " deliberately disappeared " from the spotlight , and from the nasty reputation she 'd developed			1
" i was sick of myself , to be honest , or sick of that perception of me , " she says			0
" it all felt so f — ing dirty			0
" since @entity1 's now doing a huge confessional interview in a big glossy magazine , it 's safe to say that things are looking up for her			1
after the disaster that was @entity5 , she found refuge on the stage and with a well - received turn as @entity120 in the 2012 tv movie @entity121			0
two years later , @entity1 is staging something of a film comeback with roles in three movies , including the @entity128 comedy @entity126 ( which ... maybe she should n't get too excited about ) and the true crime drama @entity130 ( which was originally set to open dec. 20 but has been pushed to an unspecified date this year )			1
her personal life , too , is finally stable : @entity1 and fiance @entity133 welcomed their first daughter in july 2012			1
and maybe most importantly , the tumult of the past 10 years has helped @entity1 understand what really matters — or , more specifically , what does n't			2
) take it away , @entity142 : " when you 're in some massive crisis and you look at yourself in a close - up and then if you visualize pulling back and seeing @entity73 and then pulling back and seeing the world , you realize how f — ing insignificant you are			0
i think that 's really the greatest thing i 've learned recently : that i do n't matter			0
it 's such a relief to know that			0
i did n't get that job -- it does n't f — ing matter			0
whatever i achieve , or do n't , will be forgotten , it 's not important			0
