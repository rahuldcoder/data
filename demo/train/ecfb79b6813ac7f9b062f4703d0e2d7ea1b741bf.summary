women 's defending champion @entity17 progressed , too , defeating @entity19 6 - 4 6 - 1 in a rematch of their thriller at the @entity22			1
even though @entity1 's serve was n't fully firing , he did n't get broken and struck 42 winners -- double his unforced error count			1
it was especially impressive given @entity8 's ability to throw off opponents with his change of pace and quirky forehand			0
@entity8 , ranked as high as 18th and now the world no. 47 , needed to claim the opening set to have a chance of upsetting the @entity35			1
once @entity1 took it in a tiebreak , and convincingly , @entity8 's shoulders slumped and he proceeded to win four games the rest of the way			0
@entity1 was happy he did n't have to spend too long on court -- under two hours -- in the draining conditions			0
" it cooled down a little bit towards the end but the first and second sets it was very hot , " he said in an interview on court afterwards			0
" it was very tough conditions and he 's a very tricky opponent , " @entity1 continued			0
" he plays strange shots and he takes your time away			0
it 's tough to get into a rhythm			0

the 31 - year - old @entity17 , bidding to become the oldest @entity6 women 's winner in the @entity6 era , captured eight of the last nine games to see off @entity19 and book a spot in the quarterfinals			1
@entity19 sent @entity17 packing in the quarterfinals at the @entity22 , although the latter was injured in the match , and some regard the 20 - year - old as the future of @entity84 tennis			2
the pair were friends , fell out when @entity19 criticized @entity17 but are now back on good terms			2
