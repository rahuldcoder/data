@entity0 , @entity1 -- some 100 probable asylum seekers have died in the past few weeks off @entity1 shores			1
but there 's no way of knowing exact numbers because the vessels on which these people perish do n't carry passenger logs			0
still , the boats keep sailing to @entity1 with desperate people believing that after a period of incarceration they 'll begin new lives			1
and still , there appears to be no end in sight to the political stalemate between the ruling @entity23 government and its coalition opponents on how to stop the boats and the people smuggling trade that parlays human misery into cold hard cash			0
detention facilities on @entity31 , in the @entity32 , 2,600 km ( 1,615 miles ) north west of @entity33 , are bursting beyond capacity as smugglers eye new destinations for their human cargo			1
162 ' asylum seekers ' rescued by @entity1 navy @entity40 , an @entity1 territory midway between the @entity1 mainland and @entity42 , has recently seen an upsurge on boat arrivals			1
this presents a new and more daunting prospect for the immigration and border authorities to deal with -- a significantly enlarged area of ocean that it must now keep under surveillance			0
making the dilemma more acute , those who land on @entity40 will be transported to @entity31 for processing			0
so critical is the problem , the @entity1 government is now asking ordinary @entity1 to help out by housing asylum seekers who have received health and security clearances and have been issued a bridging visa			1
if they so choose , these asylum seekers are placed with a family to await final clearance and that all important visa which will allow them to establish themselves in @entity1 and begin a new life			1
@entity1 vote keeps question mark over asylum seekers host families receive a small stipend for their efforts			1
that , however , is not what has @entity1 opening their homes to people from such faraway countries and cultures			1
at least not @entity79 , a @entity0 truck driver			2
he lives in the outer suburbs of the city with his family and has opened his home to @entity85 , a 21 - year - old @entity86 asylum seeker			1
" these are people 's lives and they are good people			0
i like to think people would do the same for me , " he said			0
which countries take in most refugees ? @entity85 , who has been in @entity79 's care for the past six weeks while immigration authorities determine whether he will be granted permanent asylum , is anxious			1
his 46 - year - old mother and two brothers are marooned in @entity97 , themselves waiting for @entity85 's case to be determined , hoping for asylum in @entity97 or @entity1			1
but though @entity97 does its bit to take in asylum seekers , @entity85 tells me this is not a preferred option for his family			1
too close to the feared @entity104			0
too precarious , lest @entity97 tires of them and sends them home			2
" the @entity104 have a long memory , " he said			0
@entity85 's family hail , generations back , from @entity112			1
and this he tells me was the source of the persecution his family faced in @entity86			1
" we look a bit different , " he said			0
back home , in a small village in eastern @entity86 , @entity85 was a tiler			1
his family owned several businesses -- a grocery store and a restaurant			0
they flourished in that small window of time during which the @entity104 appeared to have been contained			0
as the @entity104 slowly reasserted itself , @entity85 's family felt its racist wrath			1
in late 2010 , @entity85 's father was shot and killed by forces the young son identified as @entity104			2
not long after , the same men caught up with @entity85			2
his passport and identification papers were confiscated as he was bundled into a jeep and driven away			0
friends who were with @entity85 at the time , but were later freed , alerted @entity86 national police who gave chase			1
in an ensuing gunfight , several of the @entity104 fighters were shot dead			0
@entity85 , his jaw broken in two places , managed to escape the jeep and ran for his life			2
but the @entity104 fighters caught up with him			0
he was shot in the leg and passed out			0
when @entity85 woke , he was in a @entity97 hospital , driven 10 hours across the border by @entity86 police who had deemed this a safer place than an @entity86 hospital where the @entity104 might find him			1
" very big problem to stay in hospital in @entity86			2
there were @entity104 , " he said			0
@entity85 knew he could not return to his family in @entity86			1
he knew he would be hunted down and killed			0
his brothers too , knew that they had to escape			0
quickly , they sold all the family possessions and what remained of their businesses in @entity86 and with the money they reaped , they too fled across the border to @entity97			1
within weeks of his release from hospital , @entity85 had made contact with people smugglers -- " mafia , " as he called them			2
he needed to get as far away from @entity86 as possible			2
the @entity97 people smugglers told him they could help -- for us $ 17,000			2
one month or so after paying the " mafia , " @entity85 was flying to @entity173 en route to @entity175 , via @entity176			2
from a small town in @entity175 , @entity85 and a cohort of 14 other @entity86 were shuttled onto a rickety bus , to make their way via @entity182 , to a southern port			1
he ca n't name the port			0
no - one told him where he was being taken			0
within days of arriving in @entity175 , their journey to " who knows where " began			0
" it was a big boat , very fast , " recalled @entity85			1
" there were 185 people on the boat -- men , women and children			0
" there was nowhere to sleep , nothing to eat			0
ca n't go underneath the boat because of the bad smell ... so we stayed on top of the boat			0
" uncomfortable and frightening as it no doubt was , this was one of the lucky journeys : there had been no sign the seas might engulf the travelers and inflict the cruelty it has on so many who have set out for @entity1			2
a full day later , as the boatload of human cargo approached @entity31 on calm seas , they finally discovered how far from @entity86 they were			1
intercepted by @entity1 authorities just before reaching @entity31 , the bewildered and desperate travelers must nonetheless have breathed a sigh of relief			2
@entity85 was questioned , albeit periodically , over a period of 10 months as he languished in detention centers on @entity31 , @entity223 and in the @entity225 capital of @entity226			2
still , he counts himself as lucky			0
other asylum seekers have spent years in detention			1
but on june 12 this year , the @entity1 government granted @entity85 a health and security clearance along with a bridging visa and the right to work whilst he awaits final clearance			1
his was offered the choice of a homestay with an @entity1 family , or going it alone , perhaps with the support of the @entity86 community			1
his mother and brothers are also waiting			0
@entity85 speaks with them regularly on @entity244 : his uncle , they told him , had recently been shot and killed by the @entity104			2
@entity97 might allow his family to remain there but that 's not of much comfort to @entity85			1
would he ever see them again ? " i had a friend who got asylum here and went back to visit his family in @entity97 but he was killed , " he said			1
" and i am a wanted person			0
" if @entity1 allows him to stay , reuniting with his mother and brothers would be the final lucky break			0
and little of it thanks to @entity1 's politicians who continue their squabbling and point - scoring			0

@entity85 fears for the safety of his family in @entity97 .			1

hundreds of potential asylum seekers risk lives trying to reach @entity1 territory by boat
many are feeling *poverty* and *repression* in countries such as @entity86 and @entity97
with detention facilities full , @entity1 citizens are being asked to house some cases
@entity85 , 21 , from @entity86 is being hosted by a family near @entity0 until his case is heard
