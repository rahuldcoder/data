an @entity7 woman looks at a blood - stained car of two women killed in the 2007 @entity14 shooting			1
a sixth security guard is in plea negotiations , the sources told @entity1			1
the exact charges handed up by a federal grand jury were not revealed			0
the sources requested anonymity because the indictment remains under court seal			1
it is expected to be made public by @entity25 officials as early as monday			1
the @entity25 had no comment on the development , and defense attorneys for the men could not be reached for reaction			0
the @entity31 , which employed @entity4 to protect @entity33 diplomats and other employees , also had no comment			2
@entity4 said it would n't comment until there 's an official announcement			0
@entity7 authorities accused @entity4 guards of killing 17 civilians and wounding nearly 30 in the september 2007 shootings in @entity14 in western @entity9			1
@entity4 said its guards were protecting a @entity33 diplomatic convoy when they came under attack from armed insurgents			1
the guards returned fire , @entity4 said			2
but an @entity7 investigation called the killings " premeditated murder " and accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately			2
the first @entity33 soldiers to arrive on the scene also told investigators they found no evidence the guards were fired upon , sources told @entity1			0
the complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors			0
among the potential problems is the uncertain limit of a law passed by @entity66 that prevents prosecution of military personnel or others working for the military and leaves open the question of those working for other @entity33 government departments and agencies abroad			0
the incident heightened tensions between @entity33 and @entity7 government officials and contributed to a protracted debate over the extent of immunity that @entity33 military personnel and civilian contractors have from @entity7 laws			0
security contractors have had immunity from @entity7 law under a provision put into place in the early days of the @entity33 - led occupation of @entity7			2
but starting next year , under a @entity33 - @entity7 security agreement that @entity7 approved thursday , @entity7 will have the " primary right to exercise jurisdiction " over @entity33 contractors and their employees			0
