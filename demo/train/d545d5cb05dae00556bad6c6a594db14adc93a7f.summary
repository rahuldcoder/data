-- nearly eight years later , @entity1 still remembers being surprised			1
" stonewalling is what gets politicians in trouble , when they ... try to cover up , " @entity1 says			1
it was one of those television moments that linger in the national consciousness , like @entity9 sitting down with @entity10 , @entity11 with @entity12 , or @entity13 asking @entity14 what the hell he had been thinking			2
@entity17 was with @entity18 then , and she got the " get " -- the first interview with @entity21 , the @entity22 congressman at the center of the @entity25 media frenzy			1
the former @entity27 intern , you 'll recall , had been found murdered in @entity29 , and law enforcement sources let it be known that the married @entity21 had been having an affair with her			1
in an interview airing sunday on " @entity34 " ( 10 a.m. et , during @entity0 's " @entity35 with @entity36 " ) , @entity17 says she was surprised when @entity21 refused to acknowledge the romantic relationship			1
" stonewalling is what gets politicians in trouble , when they stonewall or they try to cover up , " she says			2
" i think that the general public and the news media wanted him to be honest , and if he could be honest about that part of the story , then he could be -- then he would be believed when he was answering other questions as to whether or not he had anything to do with her disappearance			1
" i often focus on media excess and media mistakes on the program , but we also try to highlight good journalism			2
the segment includes two @entity58 reporters , @entity59 and @entity60 , who cracked the @entity25 mystery in a 13 - part series last year			2
they did what the @entity27 police could not : they identified @entity66 , an illegal @entity67 immigrant , as @entity25 's likely killer			0
authorities issued an arrest warrant for the imprisoned suspect this week			0
but @entity59 and @entity72 talk about how they were roundly criticized for resurrecting the case and accused of sensationalizing it			0
it 's clear that @entity25 's case became a huge deal in 2001 because of the @entity80 connection			0
at the same time , @entity17 says , " the news media had changed			1
this was the gradual evolution of what the news media was doing			1
there was flavor of the week , the story du jour			0
" the @entity25 frenzy became the precursor for the missing - women tv melodramas that followed : @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94			0
the stories of women who were not celebrities , whom no one had heard of before , became national soap operas because they drove cable and morning show ratings			0
at least , in @entity25 's case , the soap opera appears to be drawing to a close .			0
