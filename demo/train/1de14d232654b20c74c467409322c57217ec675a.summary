-- in " @entity2 , " the plot is simple : an asteroid headed for @entity4 is ready to wipe out life as we know it			1
but the film is n't just a rehashing of the doomsday plots you might be familiar with from movies like " @entity12 " or " @entity13			1
" instead , the film follows @entity15 ( @entity16 ) on a last - minute road - trip with his neighbor , @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , as they drive from @entity21 to @entity22 in search of @entity15 's high school girlfriend -- " the one that got away			1
" along with @entity16 and @entity19 , the film has a stellar supporting cast , including @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , to name a few			1
the story mixes a range of emotions -- regret , spite , fear and love -- through this backdrop of pending doom , balancing humor and sadness with dread			1
written by @entity43 , whose work includes the 2008 adaptation of the novel " @entity46 , " " @entity2 " also marks her directorial debut			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity43 from her home in @entity49 about the origins of " seeking a friend , " directing @entity16 and who would be the first to let loose in the world 's last days			1
@entity0 : " @entity2 " is about the annihilation of @entity4 by an asteroid			1
is the doom of the human race something you 've pondered a lot ? @entity60 : i 've definitely been thinking about it a long time ( laughs )			1
most of my nightmares that jolt me awake either involve the cosmos or something completely out of human control			1
in reality , i worry more about nuclear war , or war in general			1
i 've been more " world weary " in the last 10 years than before			1
but even still , in a way , i saw ( the film ) as a way to explore human emotions			1
i wanted that epic backdrop , but to keep the storytelling very intimate and character driven			1
@entity0 : the beginning of the film is very funny and sarcastic -- but it becomes sad			1
how do you find the balance between those sentiments ? @entity60 : when you go through something like this , if it is a death or divorce , you have to find ways to cope with it -- to see humor in the worst situations			2
i do think there 's a fine line between comedy and ( tragedy ) , and sometimes both are happening at the exact same time			2
it 's something i 've lived through and i 've always tried to laugh through those dark times			2
in writing the script , it was something i kept in mind			2
@entity16 has always been one of those people who 's great at finding that tone			2
( his " @entity107 " character ) @entity106 was a tragic - comic character			2
so much pain behind the smile			2
@entity0 : when watching this movie , a lot of questions go through one 's mind about what they 'd do in this situation			2
some people act crazy , and some people continue to have yard sales , or work their job at the deli			2
@entity60 : right , right			2
i do think people would go about their business			0
routine is part of coping			0
@entity130 was something where we all had to go back to work on monday			0
... some people would do it because they 're creatures of habit , some people would do it because it 's what they love			0
@entity0 : the other theme that 's prevalent , and is utterly devastating throughout , is regret			0
are you a regretful person ? @entity60 : i 'm not , but i have them anyway			0
i try not to dwell			0
i feel very much like ( @entity19 's character ) @entity18 in that sense , where i try to live my life to the fullest			1
but by doing that , you still end up missing out and spreading yourself very thin			0
i 've spent holidays with ex-boyfriends and felt like i missed out on christmas eve with my family			0
i 'm a person that thinks time is very precious and our only commodity			0
... it 's so upsetting when i feel like something has wasted my time			0
@entity0 : you hate the @entity164 do n't you ? @entity60 : i have n't had to go there too many times in my life , so it 's not the worst place on @entity4			1
i 'd say the @entity170 on @entity171 and @entity172 , where i live , is hell on @entity4			1
@entity0 : this was @entity16 's first film that he did after leaving " @entity107			1
" what did you notice about how he works ? @entity60 : he never stops working			0
he 's always thinking , always present			0
he trusted me for some reason , which was so lovely , and yet we 'd watch playback together -- he 's the kind of guy who looks at his tapes and learns from it -- and for the most part , we just agreed on what we both liked			0
he is n't the kind of comedian who is " on " all the time			0
and in that way , he 's so funny and comfortable to be around			0
@entity0 : the apocalypse has been a serious news topic lately			0
did you research how different cultures view the end of the world before writing this ? @entity60 : i looked a little bit into it			0
i 've been obsessed with doomsday for a long time -- the idea that different cultures respond to it differently , and religions will change people 's outlook on it			0
there is a bit of that in the film -- different cultures , different classes of people represented			1
a lot of thought was put behind how different people would react to the news			0
@entity0 : in the beginning of the film , there 's a lot of straight - laced adults letting loose because they have nothing to lose			1
is there a type of person who 's going to be doing heroin in their final days ? @entity60 : in the script i wrote , " the most normal - looking couple enters with heroin			0
" i think ( it 's ) the most buttoned - up ( who ) would want to cut loose the most .			0
