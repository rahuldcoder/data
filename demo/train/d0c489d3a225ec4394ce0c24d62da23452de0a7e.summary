-- @entity1 has claimed the referee " did n't let " his @entity4 team win tuesday 's @entity6 semifinal second leg against archrivals @entity7			1
@entity4 could only draw 1 - 1 at the @entity8 , losing 3 - 1 on aggregate after last week 's controversial 2 - 0 defeat to @entity7 in @entity4 which left both clubs facing charges from ruling body @entity13			1
it was the two teams ' fourth meeting in 18 days -- clashes known as " @entity17 " -- and tensions between the clubs have become strained in that period , with allegations of foul play and racism being made			0
there was further controversy on tuesday , when @entity4 saw a 48th - minute goal from @entity27 forward @entity28 ruled out by referee @entity29 after @entity1 was adjudged to have fouled @entity30			1
@entity7 held but go through to @entity6 final " once again it was the referee that did n't allow us to dictate the outcome , " @entity1 , who became the world 's most expensive player when he moved to the @entity34 from @entity35 in 2009 , told @entity4 's official website			1
" we knew we could beat @entity7 , but the referee did n't let us			1
@entity28 's goal was good			0
@entity42 pushed me and i landed on @entity30			0
he did n't used to fall to the ground in @entity45 , but he 's picked up the bad habit of doing it here like everyone else			0
" @entity49 's @entity7 took the lead on the night when @entity51 forward @entity52 coolly converted after a pass from compatriot @entity54 on 54 minutes			1
real , without head coach @entity55 after he was sent to the stands in the first leg , equalized through @entity59 's @entity58 in the 65th minute following a shot from @entity61 that rattled the post			0
@entity4 were left frustrated after last week 's first leg , when they felt @entity65 defender @entity64 was wrongly dismissed for a challenge on @entity67			1
has the time arrived for change in football ? " the referee in the first match took away our chances of playing the final , " @entity64 's fellow @entity65 international @entity1 said			1
" whoever knows anything about football knows that @entity7 get preferential treatment			1
we knew something would happen			0
we knew that if we scored a goal that everything would be done to keep us from going through			0
" this is n't good for football			0
we should just stay home and allow @entity7 to play alone if things do n't change			2
" @entity49 has guided the @entity88 club to the second final in @entity13 's premier club competition under his stewardship and a third in five years			2
@entity7 secured the first of three @entity6 triumphs at @entity95 's @entity94 in 1992 , a match @entity49 played in , and will return to the rebuilt venue for the may 28 showpiece			1
" taking into account what these players have come through , it 's incredible , " the 40 - year - old told @entity13 's website			2
" they just keep going and going			0
i give my thanks to every one of them ; what they have achieved is beyond definition			0
we won our first @entity6 in @entity94 and now we are going in search of our fourth			2
" @entity7 look likely to face @entity35 in a repeat of the 2009 final in @entity116 , after the @entity118 leaders defeated @entity120 outfit @entity119 2 - 0 in their semifinal first - leg tie on april 26			1
the two teams meet again at @entity35 's @entity123 on wednesday			0
" i 'm not sure who we will face but i imagine it will be @entity35 , " @entity49 said			2

it would be an honor for me , a young coach , to reach the final against him			0
