-- the number of states reporting widespread seasonal flu activity jumped from four to 10 last week , the @entity1 said friday			1
widespread activity was reported in @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , according to the @entity1 's weekly flu advisory report , covering the week ending december 21			1
the previous week , only @entity6 , @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity13 reported widespread flu			2
" widespread " means that more than 50 % of geographic regions in a state -- counties , for example -- are reporting flu activity			1
it addresses the spread of the flu , not its severity			2
however , six states -- @entity6 , @entity9 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity13 -- reported a high proportion of outpatient visits to health care providers for flu - like illnesses			2
so far , " it 's a typical influenza season , if i can use that word , " said dr. @entity35 , a medical officer in the @entity1 's flu division			1
the season usually begins in the winter months and peaks in january or february			0
the only atypical thing seen this year is that the most common strain has been @entity43 , which became known as swine flu during a 2009 outbreak			1
" it 's the same virus that we saw in 2009 that caused the pandemic , " @entity35 said			0
at the time , it was called swine flu since it was seen for the first time in humans			1
but since then , " it 's established itself very nicely in the human population , " @entity35 said			0
" we 've seen it every season since 2009 in people			0
" the virus is no longer referred to as swine flu but instead as a human seasonal virus			1
the strain is so common that it 's included in the flu vaccine , including this year 's vaccination , he said			1

the agency does not track adult deaths related to the flu , although some states do , and deaths have been reported			0
the exact number of flu - related adult deaths is hard to track and varies from year to year			0
the @entity1 has estimated that from 1976 through 2007 , between 3,000 and 49,000 people died of flu - related causes			1
" it depends on the season ; it depends on the virus , " @entity35 said			0
last year , 381,000 people were hospitalized and 169 children died in what 's being called a relatively severe season			2
however , the @entity1 estimates that flu vaccination prevented 6.6 million illnesses last year , 3.2 million doctor visits and at least 79,000 hospitalizations			2
flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older , especially pregnant women and those at high risk of complications , including the elderly , children younger than 5 years and those with underlying medical conditions such as asthma or diabetes			0
antiviral medications are a good treatment if you do get sick , @entity35 said , particularly those at high risk for complications			0
ideally , antivirals should be started within two days of when symptoms appear			0
