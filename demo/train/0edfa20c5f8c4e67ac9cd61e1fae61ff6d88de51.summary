-- over the past month , we 've watched from distant shores as @entity3 has plunged into a debt crisis			1
mounting pressure from global financial markets forced @entity3 to begin a drastic austerity program			1
with a fiscal deficit of 8.1 percent of gdp and government debt of 115 percent of @entity9 expected this year , @entity3 has promised to turn itself around by 2013			1
to do this , the government has adopted an ambitious fiscal consolidation program that would reduce the annual deficit by 7 percent of gdp this year , 4 percent next year , and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013			2
the @entity15 and the @entity16 have announced an extraordinary $ 1 trillion package to support the plan , and the @entity19 has announced its own extraordinary measures			2
are there lessons the @entity23 can or should draw from the @entity3 situation ? first , we are not @entity3			1
the @entity23 is by far the world 's largest single economy			1
our economy is competitive , diversified and rich in human capital and natural resources			0
while the rest of the world is important for our growth , our domestic market is vast , which means that , unlike @entity3 , we can usually rely on domestic demand to drive the economy			1
at their best , our financial markets are dynamic , have deep pockets and provide the liquidity for our innovative economy			2
we issue the world 's reserve currency , which minimizes our currency market risk			2
and unlike @entity3 , because we have currency flexibility , we can adjust the value of the dollar to improve our underlying economic performance , if necessary			1
but we are facing very serious fiscal challenges , too -- and for many of the same reasons as @entity3			1
like @entity3 , our fiscal path is unsustainable for as far as the eye can see			1
our debt has surged far above what we have normally been able to manage			2
and unless fiscal policy changes , it is projected to continue heading up indefinitely			2
our debt - to - gdp ratio is projected to exceed 60 percent this year , well above our average for the past 40 years ( around 40 percent ) and close to a peacetime high			2
and it 's projected to keep on rising			0
like @entity3 ( and all advanced industrial countries ) , we can expect our fiscal situation to get worse in about 10 years , as the baby boomers ' retirement accelerates			1
in a generation , the debt is expected to be well over 150 percent of gdp			0
by 2050 , it 's projected to be over 300 percent and still heading upward			0
we can not sustain this much debt without a crisis			0
while the @entity23 may have more fiscal running room than @entity3 , we wo n't be able to outrun our creditors if they think we ca n't manage our fiscal affairs			1
the impasse in @entity76 is giving rise to jitters that we ca n't politically solve our problems , no matter how wealthy our economy			0
and as the past few weeks illustrate , if we lose credibility with creditors , they may downgrade our debt , demand higher interest rates , and in the worst case refuse to hold our debt because of fear of default			1
maintaining the confidence of our creditors is critical for the @entity23 : we depend on capital inflows to close our fiscal gap because our savings rate is so low			1
it is harder to rebuild confidence than to lose it			0
finally , as @entity3 so vividly illustrates , it is better act on your own timetable and according to your own priorities , rather than have actions forced upon you by financial markets			1
if the @entity23 can make fiscal changes sooner rather than later , once the economy is on a stronger footing , adjustment can be more gradual and less costly			1
then our citizens will be able to manage change more easily			0
what will it take for the @entity23 to get its fiscal house in order ? we need a plan			1
as we 've seen in @entity115 -- and even on @entity116 over the past week -- uncertainty sows fear , panic and unrest			0
but our fiscal future does not have to look like this			0
there is a way forward			0
@entity23 's first fiscal challenge is political will , not ability to pay			1
in partnership with the @entity23 people , @entity23 policymakers need to settle on a reasonable and sensible fiscal recovery plan soon that is credible to both the markets and the ultimate financier : the @entity23 taxpayer			1
it should be multiyear to reassure creditors and taxpayers that we can indeed manage our affairs over time and that it will not force draconian austerity , if done correctly			1
we need to know where we want to go and how we can get there			0
a clear road map for fiscal change will allow everyone to plan and manage , in contrast to the cold shower the @entity3 are being forced to take			1
in broad economic terms , the answer is simpler than most people realize			0
as most experts agree , we need to put the budget on track for stabilizing the debt at no more than 60 percent of gdp when we can realistically manage change			0
( the 60 percent threshold still has credibility for advanced industrial countries in the global marketplace			0
) although our debt is below that now , commitments already in place will put us on a higher path , even before the baby boomers start to retire			1
but we need to start phasing in policy changes soon to shift to a more sustainable debt path			2
much like a household budget , a fiscal recovery package also needs to be fair to succeed			0
any plan needs to reflect shared sacrifice			0
our fiscal problems are so big , everything has to be on the table			0
just cutting spending will savage government and prevent it from delivering the things we all rely upon to live our lives and to make them better			0
just raising taxes will take money from the poorest and the middle class and rob the country of needed incentives for the investments that boost higher growth			0
but within budget limits , we also must make sure that any fiscal package promotes our key values and needs : protecting the weakest among us and raising living standards through increasing human capital ( including education ) , promoting innovation and providing basic infrastructure			0
ultimately , getting our fiscal house in order is about shared sacrifice -- and shared hope			0
putting a fiscal recovery plan in place will hasten the recovery and make living standards higher than they would otherwise be			2
we do n't have to look like @entity3 does now			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity203 : we *'re* not @entity3 , but we have serious fiscal woes for many of same reasons
she says our fiscal path is unsustainable and worsening , our debt is far above normal
@entity23 must maintain confidence of creditors , act on its own timetable , she says
@entity203 says we need a clear multiyear plan that 's credible to markets and to @entity23 taxpayers
