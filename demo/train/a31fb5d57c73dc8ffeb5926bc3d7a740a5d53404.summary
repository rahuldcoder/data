-- stargazers crossed their fingers thursday as @entity3 attempted to revive the planet - hunting @entity5 probe , idled since a piece of critical equipment gave out in orbit two months ago			1
@entity5 has been sidelined since mid-may , when a reaction wheel that helps aim the spacecraft 's telescope failed			1
controllers launched a series of tests that will determine whether that device can be restarted , or whether another reaction wheel that quit in july 2012 can be reactivated			2
controllers have remained in communication with the craft , which is about 45 million miles from @entity21			0
it takes about four minutes for a radio signal to traverse that gap			0
in the first round of tests , telemetry from the craft indicated the wheel that shut down in may spun counterclockwise , but did n't respond to commands to turn clockwise , @entity3 reported			1
controllers will go ahead with tests scheduled for next week on the other wheel while they study the results of thursday 's effort			1
@entity5 project manager @entity36 called thursday 's findings " an interesting development			1
" " while this is a positive start , it is very early in the multi-stepped process to characterize the performance of the reaction wheels and to determine if one could return to operation , " @entity36 said in a written statement			0
" the team will remain focused on the upcoming tests and report the cumulative test results at the end of the month			2
" the 15 - foot , 2,300 - pound spacecraft was launched in 2009 to search for @entity21 - size planets circling stars like our sun. the roughly $ 600 million mission has so far confirmed 134 planets and identified nearly 3,300 possible planets beyond our solar system			1
@entity5 was built with four reaction wheels and needs three to keep the spacecraft aimed precisely at its targets -- one to fine - tune the spacecraft 's position on each axis			2
after may 's failure , only two remained in service and the probe went into a low - powered state to preserve fuel			0
" we 're kind of hoping for the best , but planning for the worst , " said @entity71 , an astrophysicist at the @entity72			0
@entity5 's observations have focused on a sliver of the cosmos around the @entity77 constellations @entity78 and @entity79			2
they have led scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them			0
the craft 's light - recording photometer has shown that the intensities of as many as two - thirds of stars are more variable than our sun. and in april , researchers reported that they had identified three planets that could potentially host life			2
two of those -- @entity95 and 62f , located about 1,200 light - years away -- are considered the best candidates so far			0
" we really want @entity5 to be able to return to be able to operation in the same way that it was before the wheel failed , " said @entity71 , a former member of the @entity5 science team			1
" that 's the ultimate hope			0
" but the probe has already surpassed its three - and - a - half - year minimum expected lifespan , and it has collected enough data to keep scientists busy for up to two years			0
and even if @entity5 ca n't regain the kind of steady precision required for its observations to date , @entity3 may be able to use the spacecraft for other purposes , @entity71 said .			1

new : first round of tests yields mixed but " interesting " results , @entity3 says
@entity5 has identified 134 planets beyond our solar system
space telescope has been idled since a *key* control failed in may
@entity3 hopes to get the probe back into operation in the coming weeks
