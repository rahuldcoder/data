@entity0 -- a court in @entity6 's capital , @entity7 , lifted a ban on the @entity10 video sharing website friday , the semiofficial @entity3 news agency reported			1
the ruling came a day after prime minister @entity13 's office said @entity6 's ban on the social media service @entity16 had been lifted			1
@entity7 's @entity17 opted friday to lift its march 27 ruling that barred access to all @entity10 content , @entity3 reported , but decided to continue a block on 15 specific @entity10 links			1
in its ruling , the court said that blocking access to the website was contrary to fundamental rights and freedom of expression , the news agency said			0
it 's not clear how soon the ruling will come into effect			0
access to @entity10 still appeared to be blocked for @entity6 users friday			1
the restoration of @entity16 came after @entity6 's @entity37 ruled wednesday that the ban violated the right to free expression and demanded that citizens ' access to the popular microblogging service be restored			1
several @entity16 users told @entity1 on thursday that the social media service was now functional inside the country			1
disruption to the service began hours after @entity13 threatened to " eradicate " @entity16 at a campaign rally on march 20 , blaming social media for fueling anti-government rhetoric			1
the @entity10 ban was imposed less than a week later			0
@entity6 went to the polls in nationwide municipal elections sunday			0
wiretap leaks the @entity6 government said its @entity10 block was a response to the leak of a conversation between top government officials purportedly discussing the possibility of going to war with neighboring @entity64			2
@entity6 's top media regulating agency announced a similar ban on the broadcast of the conversation to television and radio channels			2
members of @entity6 's political elite have been battered by a campaign of wiretap leaks recorded by unknown operatives and distributed daily on the internet for more than a month			2
until the purported @entity64 - related leak , all of the wiretaps seemed to be recordings of phone conversations among @entity13 , his inner circle , government officials and top corporate executives			0
@entity13 , of the ruling @entity85 , has called some recordings " immorally edited material , " including a conversation in which a man who sounds like the prime minister purportedly instructs his son to hide tens of millions of dollars in cash from police investigators			2
but he has also confirmed the authenticity of other wiretaps , in which he is heard instructing the head of a major television news network to cut short the live broadcast of a rival politician 's speech in parliament			0
@entity6 's government has accused social media platforms , including @entity16 and @entity105 , of being used to spread false information and lies			1
@entity1 's @entity108 reported from @entity0 , and @entity109 wrote in @entity110			0
@entity1 's @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .			0
