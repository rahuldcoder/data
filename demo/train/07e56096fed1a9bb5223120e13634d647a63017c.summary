-- @entity1 is so passionate about president @entity2 , even her pet lovebird campaigned for him			1
" i left the campaign sign by her cage , and whenever she would get out she would always hop right over to it and sit for long stretches staring at it , " said the retired middle school teacher from @entity5			2
" i guess she was a political bird			2
well , so is the rest of her family , so she came by it honestly			0
" @entity17 campaigns in her swing state for the president pretty much nonstop , but she paused long enough to post a photo of the starry - eyed creature -- known as @entity22 , @entity23 ( @entity23 ) -- on the @entity24 for @entity2 facebook page			1
it got more " likes " and thoughtful comments than almost anything else she 's ever posted , and that includes the @entity29 feed and @entity31 pages she runs for her neighborhood 's @entity2 campaign			1
suddenly , she realized there was a lesson			0
" when we are phone banking , we have to work really hard to get someone to pick up and talk with us , " @entity1 said			0
" people love their pets so they pay attention to this kind of thing , and it 's a really positive message for them to see from us			1
" @entity2 outspends @entity51 online presidential pets have certainly played a role in politicking before			1
president @entity55 often appeared in photos with @entity57 , his @entity59 terrier			2
president @entity60 sent holiday videos of his dog @entity63 every @entity64			1
president @entity66 's cat , socks , even had its own book			2
but this virtual campaign by @entity70 to encourage people to " like " its @entity31 page , post photos of their pets and recruit friends is taking the presidential love of pets to a whole new level			1
it seems to be working			0
more than 16,500 people have " liked " the page so far			1
hundreds of others have posted photos of their furry friends			0
a dog named @entity85 abandoned his namesake 's political party to wear a navy @entity2 shirt			1
baby , a gray cat , looks smart in a " cats for @entity2 " collar			1
there 's even an unnamed chicken sporting an @entity2 bandana			1
such pet - specific merchandise is available on an accompanying @entity2 campaign site			1
there 's an " @entity107 " cat collar , a " 2012 @entity2 's best friend " dog collar with a matching leash , a @entity105 " car magnet , and many others			1
all purchases count as campaign donations			2
chicagoan @entity110 posted a photo of her pit - bull mix @entity113 sporting an @entity2 t - shirt and sitting patiently with human - sized @entity2 sunglasses perched on his wet nose			1
" my brother works with the campaign , and he brought over a bunch of gear , " @entity110 said			2
" @entity113 is clearly such a tolerant and sweet dog			2
" while @entity110 and her husband have donated money to @entity2 's re-election effort , the photo she submitted is the only real campaigning she plans to do			1
" we are still enthusiastic about the president , but i 'll leave the grass - roots campaigning to my brother , " she said			2
" i do like this particular effort , though , and i thought the least i could do was lend my support by taking this ridiculous picture			0
" there is no parallel pet - themed campaign for @entity136 candidate @entity51			2
there is a vets for @entity139 , but that 's for the military -- not the animal -- kind of vet			0
a dogs against romney facebook page has racked up more than 55,000 " likes , " but it was created as a tongue - in - cheek response to the story of how @entity51 strapped a crate containing his @entity151 setter , @entity150 , to the roof of his car during a road trip to @entity155			0
the page is not sanctioned by any campaign			1
" we 've seen this for months			0
the @entity2 campaign would rather talk about anything under the sun , including dogs , if it means they can distract from the most important issue on the minds of every @entity170 -- jobs and the economy , " @entity162 spokeswoman @entity161 said			1
" every minute team @entity2 talks about something other than jobs and the economy , they are attempting to hide @entity2 's record from voters			2
" the @entity2 campaign wo n't comment on its digital strategy			1
but its attempt to engage with the pet set may now be aimed at many more voters			0
as a part of its general online ad blitz , @entity2 for @entity170 created an ad in which the candidate himself never appears			1
instead , under the title " @entity189 for @entity2 , " is a lone photo of the president 's dog , @entity193			1
none of the popular online animal sites like @entity196 , @entity197 , or @entity198 say they 've received the ad , but the ad has run on several general news sites , which reach a broader audience			0
" they are clearly wide - casting with this ad and are looking for places where they can persuade swing voters and independents and women with this , " said @entity204 , an @entity205 psychology professor and author of " @entity207 , " a book about the role of emotion in deciding elections			0
" it 's a nice , neutral message			0
who does n't like a dog ? " @entity223 , senior editor for @entity224 , a trade publication that covers the digital advertising industry , thinks the dog ads are a strategic attempt to cultivate a certain type of voter			1
" maybe @entity2 's staff thinks people who are sentimental about their animals are more likely to be interested in more liberal issues , " @entity223 said			1
" as the campaign builds up its data on who views these ads , they can go back later and specifically target that reader with whatever their next appropriate issue ad is			2
" @entity242 , a volunteer with the @entity243 , submitted a photo of her 16 - year - old @entity246 cat @entity247 wearing an @entity2 bandana to pet lovers for @entity2			2
she thinks the pet campaign lends the president credibility			1
" it helps him seem so genuine , " she said			0
" for me , as someone who is passionate about animals , how genuine someone is as a human is most important to me in a politician			0
i think he reflects my values , and it is clear he is a passionate advocate for human rights and for low - income people			0
i do n't see that from the other side			0
" the facebook page also has kept @entity242 engaged with the @entity2 campaign			1
she visits it regularly to click through and comment on other people 's pictures			0
@entity1 , who put her lovebird 's photo on the page , also continues to visit the site			0
she thinks it resonates with voters who appreciate seeing something positive when so much else about the campaign -- especially advertising -- is negative			1
" something like this reaches everyday people , " she said , " and we 're going to need every one of them to get out there			0
" the campaign volunteer says she would happily post other photos of her @entity2 - curious bird if it would help her candidate , but unfortunately , @entity288 died recently			1
" she went to sleep when i was at a @entity291 organizing meeting , of all things , " @entity1 said			0
not all is lost though			0
@entity293 is considering putting a tiny @entity2 scarf on her son 's rescue hamster , @entity298			2
" although i 'd have to take the picture superfast , " she said			0
" he is a hamster , after all			0
it 's likely he 'd eat it			0
and that message might not seem as supportive			0

it may be a campaign first : pets in political outfits advertising for a campaign

the @entity317 ' dog , @entity193 , appears solo in a campaign ad for the president
