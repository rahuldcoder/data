@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's intelligence agency has detained several people who gave information to the @entity7 before the @entity7 killed @entity8 , officials in @entity1 said wednesday			1
the agency detained several people who cooperated with the @entity12 , a @entity1 official said ; the official did not know the precise number			1
one rented a safe house to the @entity12 in @entity19 , the @entity1 city where @entity7 special forces killed @entity8 early may 2 , a @entity1 source familiar with the arrests said wednesday			1
some of the @entity12 sources in @entity1 custody were low - level and not considered crucial , a senior administration official told @entity2			1
the official said the sources were not spying on @entity1 , and therefore should be dealt with leniently			2
news of the arrests , first reported by @entity27 , is likely to further strain an already rocky relationship between the two countries			0
the @entity7 has complained that @entity1 has not done enough to fight @entity30 and other militants			1
senior @entity7 officials also suspect that some in @entity1 helped @entity8 live there			1
cia director @entity34 reportedly has told legislators that @entity1 was either involved in helping the world 's most wanted fugitive avoid detection or was incompetent for not knowing he was living on @entity1 soil			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , has protested unilateral action by the @entity7 in @entity1 , such as the raid that killed @entity8 : the @entity7 did not tell @entity1 about it until the raid was over			1
it also has complained about civilian casualties caused by suspected @entity7 drone strikes that have targeted @entity46 militants in northwestern @entity1			1
now comes news that @entity1 has detained some of the very people who helped the @entity7 find and kill @entity8			1
@entity34 discussed the arrests friday with @entity1 army chief gen. @entity52 and lt. gen. @entity53 , @entity1 's head of military intelligence , the official said			1
a @entity7 official confirmed that the discussion had taken place but would not give details about the arrests			2
the first @entity1 official did not say whether the owner of the safe house was suspected of being a @entity12 informant			1
he asked not to be identified because he was discussing sensitive internal matters			0
the second @entity1 official asked to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak to the news media			2
a @entity1 military spokesman confirmed that there were " a number of people arrested in @entity19 after the raid on the osama bin laden compound " but said he could not say what relationship , if any , they may have had with the @entity12			1
some were seized at " a house in @entity19 that was used to monitor the @entity8 compound activities , " said @entity77 , the military spokesman			2
" they could have been @entity1 who were informants to the @entity12			1
" @entity77 said those arrests were made by @entity1 's powerful military intelligence agency , @entity80 , " immediately after the raid , so this is not a new piece of information			2
" he and the intelligence official who asked not to be named were responding to a report in the @entity27 that @entity1 had arrested five @entity12 informants who gave information to the @entity7 before the raid on @entity8 's hideout			1
the newspaper attributed the report to " @entity7 officials " without naming them			0
it said one of those arrested was a @entity1 army major who had kept records of license plate numbers on cars that stopped at the bin laden compound			2
@entity77 , the @entity1 military spokesman , said that assertion was " categorically " not true			2
the newspaper also cited a top @entity12 official 's damning assessment of @entity1 's cooperation with @entity7 counterterrorism efforts			1
asked last week at a private briefing of the @entity110 to rate @entity1 's cooperation with the @entity7 on counterterrorism operations , using a scale of one to 10 , deputy cia director @entity108 gave it a three , the @entity27 said , quoting " officials familiar with the exchange			1
" asked wednesday by @entity2 to rate the @entity1 spy agency 's relationship with the @entity12 on a scale of one to 10 , military spokesman @entity77 gave it a four			1
@entity121 spokesman @entity120 said wednesday that maintaining the @entity7 relationship with @entity1 is " complicated , " but " helps our national security interest			1
" he called the cooperation " vital , " and said @entity1 is " an important partner in fighting terrorism			2
" " they have been reliable in providing information that 's led to successful missions against terrorists , " he said			0
at the @entity133 , spokesman @entity132 said that , despite the challenges , " more terrorists have been identified and killed on @entity1 soil than anywhere else in the world			0
and that 's , in part , due to this counter-terrorism cooperation that we have			0
so it 's in our interest to work through these challenges as they arise and to move forward			0
" @entity34 , who has been nominated to be secretary of defense , defended the relationship to @entity149 in confirmation hearings last week			0
" they maintain relationships with certain terrorist groups , " he said , adding : " they continue to not take aggressive action with regard to these safe havens , and ... they 're concerned about the sovereignty results and criticisms of the @entity7 when , in fact , my view is that the terrorists in their country are probably the greatest threat to their sovereignty			0
" during a visit last week to @entity1 , @entity34 raised the issue of two raids that appear to have failed because of intelligence leaks in recent weeks , a @entity7 official said			1
the @entity7 had shown the @entity1 evidence of two bomb - making sites near the @entity176 border , the official said , asking not to be named discussing intelligence and diplomatic issues			1
the @entity7 believed the sites were being used to stage attacks against @entity7 forces in @entity176			0
when the @entity1 raided the sites , both were empty			0
" the targets appear to have been tipped off , " the @entity7 official said			0
the relationship between the two countries has been in a downward spiral over disputes about how to pursue counterterrorism efforts			0
one reason @entity1 have supported militants in the tribal region is that the fighters are seen as a bulwark for @entity1 interests			0
that includes a focus against the influence of longtime rival @entity199 in @entity176			0
despite fears that elements sympathetic to militants are working for the @entity80 , @entity7 officials have argued that maintaining an alliance with @entity1 is crucial to the success of @entity7 anti-terrorism efforts			2
the @entity7 is suspected of carrying out routine strikes by unmanned aircraft targeting suspected terrorists in @entity1 : two suspected strikes wednesday killed 15 suspected militants , two @entity1 officials said			1
@entity1 officials have said there were more than 100 such strikes in their country last year , a record , according to @entity2 national security analyst @entity219			0
they think most of the casualties were foot soldiers or civilians , not high - value terrorism targets , he said			0
the @entity225 in @entity226 , which maintains an independent count of reported drone strikes , says there were 118 of them in 2010 , killing 600 to 1,000 people			0
polls show that nine of 10 @entity1 view the strikes unfavorably			0
many @entity1 were angered by the case of @entity235 , a @entity12 contractor who was charged with killing two @entity1 men but then released after compensation was paid to their families			2
@entity235 described the two men as attackers and said he shot them in self - defense			0
@entity243 police chief @entity242 , however , said the case was " clear - cut murder			0
" according to @entity235 , the shooting occurred january 27 after two men attacked him as he drove through a busy @entity243 neighborhood , the @entity7 @entity246 has said			0
@entity7 officials originally said @entity235 was a diplomat and tried to claim diplomatic immunity but then revealed that he was a @entity12 contractor			2
@entity12 chief @entity34 's unannounced visit last week was the latest in a series by @entity7 officials -- including secretary of state @entity255 , chairman of the @entity256 adm. @entity257 and sen. @entity258 -- efforts to smooth things over after @entity8 was killed in the @entity262 raid			1
the @entity1 military said in april that drone strikes " not only undermine our national effort against terrorism but turn public support against our efforts , which remains the key to success			0
" the @entity7 has regarded @entity1 as a top ally in its fight against the @entity273 , @entity30 , the @entity274 and other @entity1 - based militants who have launched attacks against international and @entity176 troops in @entity176			1
@entity226 has argued that @entity1 has not done enough to go after @entity30 and other extremists			0
@entity7 officials have expressed impatience with the @entity1 and suspicions that elements of the @entity80 directorate are sympathetic to militants			2
@entity2 's @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity286 contributed to this report .			0

@entity121 spokesman calls @entity7 relationship with @entity1 " complicated , " but " vital "
