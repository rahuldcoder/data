-- @entity2 president @entity1 said thursday that a recently reached security agreement with the @entity4 should not be signed until after elections in april			1
his comments in @entity7 to thousands of tribal elders at a meeting -- known as a loya jirga , or grand assembly -- are at odds with what @entity4 officials want			1
the loya jirga must decide whether to accept or reject the deal , which lays out a limited support role for @entity4 forces beyond next year			0
@entity20 spokeswoman @entity19 told reporters in @entity22 that authorities are " seeking clarity on the meaning and intention , " of @entity1 's remarks			0
" broadly speaking , when we signed the strategic partnership agreement last year , both countries committed to completing the @entity31 ( bilateral security agreement ) within one year			0
we , of course , know the math. that window is this month , and we believe that signing the @entity31 sooner rather than later is essential to give @entity2 certainty about their future before the upcoming elections , and enable the @entity4 and other partners to plan for @entity4 presence after 2014 , " she said			1
" we need a timely conclusion of this in order to plan for a -- any potential post- 2014 presence -- which means signing it by the end of the year , " @entity19 said			0
if approved , the agreement would go into effect january 1 , 2015 , and last " until the end of 2024 and beyond , unless terminated " by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party , according to a copy of the deal posted online by the @entity2 government that a @entity4 official confirms is authentic			1
the subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries , especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men , women and children were killed			0
the proposed deal contains references to respecting " @entity2 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , " and adds @entity4 forces " shall not target @entity2 civilians , including in their homes			1
" it does not address past transgressions			0
" if you accept and the parliament passes it , the bilateral security agreement would be signed when our election is done -- without any problem and with dignity , " @entity1 said thursday in @entity7			2
elections are scheduled for april			0
the @entity2 president also addressed the subject of trust between his country and the @entity4			1
" my trust with @entity4 is not good			1
i do n't trust them , and they do n't trust me			1
the last 10 years have shown that i have fought with them , and they have made propaganda against me , " he said			0
@entity4 troops first deployed to @entity2 after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , which were coordinated by @entity100 leaders then based in the south @entity102 nation			2
since taking office , president @entity103 has promised -- and , in some cases , acted -- to reduce troop levels there , in addition to stating the goal of ending the @entity4 combat mission by the end of 2014			2
the approval of a security agreement would pave the way for @entity4 troops to remain on the ground in @entity2 beyond that			2
