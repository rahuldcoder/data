the latest setback came monday , when a 45 - person team of @entity6 and @entity19 experts , accompanied by monitors from the @entity21 , abandoned their effort to reach the site after hearing explosions and being warned of heavy fighting in the area			1
it 's the same thing that happened sunday			2

" the @entity235 want to do more			0
we expect they 'll do more , " @entity213 said			0
