@entity0 -- a policeman in @entity0 appears to have accidentally revealed an arrest plan for @entity5 founder @entity4 , in what @entity7 media have branded an embarrassing slip - up by @entity0 's @entity10			1
the photo , snapped by the @entity13 news agency and published in several newspapers , shows a clipboard held by a uniformed officer friday outside the @entity18 embassy where @entity4 has been holed up since june			1
clearly legible in a zoomed - in view of the clipboard , on a sheet of paper headed " restricted , " are the words : " @entity23 brief - summary of current position re. @entity4			2
action required - @entity4 to be arrested under all circumstances			2
" it goes on to suggest possible ways in which he could exit the building , such as in a diplomatic bag or vehicle			0
the document also appears to warn of the possibilities of " distraction , " perhaps by supporters of @entity4 who have previously rallied outside the central @entity0 embassy building			1
@entity7 police have previously made clear that they intend to arrest @entity4 if he leaves the embassy , where he is shielded by its diplomatic protection			2
@entity18 says @entity7 would be ' suicidal ' to try and enter embassy for @entity4 but the carelessness of an officer in apparently exposing details of the force 's plan will likely cause red faces			1
asked about the photograph , a spokeswoman for the @entity10 told @entity1 " the document is not related to the @entity4 case			1
" the apparent slip - up is the latest twist in the @entity4 case , which has brought unlikely drama to the posh @entity57 neighborhood since he sought refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to @entity61 to face questioning over sex crime allegations			1
this month , @entity18 officially offered @entity4 asylum in the @entity66 country , but the @entity7 say they will not give him safe passage out of the embassy			2
the @entity69 says @entity7 has a legal obligation to hand him over to @entity61 , after @entity4 's legal efforts to avoid extradition were rejected by @entity7 courts up to the @entity75			0
the dispute gathered heat when the @entity69 , in a letter to @entity18 officials , cited a little known law that could temporarily suspend the embassy 's diplomatic protection and allow authorities to enter and arrest @entity4			1
@entity18 's resident has dismissed any steps in that direction as " suicidal			0
" @entity4 's lawyer , @entity87 , said his client was willing to answer @entity61 prosecutors ' questions , but only if he was given certain guarantees			0
@entity4 , an @entity92 , and his supporters claim a @entity95 grand jury has been empaneled to consider charges against him			0
he says the allegations against him in @entity61 are politically motivated , and claims to fear @entity61 will transfer him to the @entity95 , where he claims he could face the death penalty for the work of @entity5			0
@entity61 angrily rejected that allegation last week			0
what 's next for @entity4 ? @entity1 's @entity102 contributed to this report .			0
