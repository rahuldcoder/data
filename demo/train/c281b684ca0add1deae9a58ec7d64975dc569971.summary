-- jury selection in the trial of @entity3 , the former @entity4 assistant football coach charged with child rape , is scheduled to start tuesday in @entity6			1
a judge last week denied his attorneys ' latest bid for a delay , allowing the case to move forward			0
@entity3 , 68 , has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys over 14 years			1
prosecutors allege he met some of his accusers through @entity17 , a charity he created for underprivileged children			1
he has pleaded not guilty to the charges			1
according to a source close to the @entity3 family , he is expected to attend court tuesday			1
the allegations against @entity3 led to the firing of iconic @entity4 head football coach @entity25 only months before he died of complications from lung cancer			2
several of the people whom prosecutors accuse @entity3 of abusing asked a judge to protect their identities at trial			1
however , judge @entity34 on monday ruled the alleged victims ' identities may not be concealed during the trial , although they will be protected through the jury selection process			1
" courts are not customarily in the business of withholding information , " @entity34 's ruling said			0
" secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully			0
" prosecutors in @entity3 case present new , graphic details but , the judge noted , " it is also to be hoped that various news organizations that will report on the trial will use what has become their professional custom to protect the privacy of alleged victims			1
" @entity0 generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault			0
victim advocacy groups slammed the judge 's decision late monday , expressing their hope it would not have a chilling effect on the reporting of child sexual abuse			2
" the judge placed a significant burden on this class of victims by stating that they have ' a duty to the community to testify ' about the crime , but denying them privacy protections in exchange for that testimony			0
by bravely coming forward , victims serve in the interest of public safety ; they should be assured that their privacy will be protected , " the @entity79 , the @entity80 and the @entity81 said in a joint statement			0
those asking for their identities to be concealed included one man known simply as @entity89			0
his attorney , @entity90 , said he believes his client , now 28 , is the strongest witness for the prosecution and will be called to testify first			0
" in society , sometimes we question why rape victims are reluctant to come forward , " @entity90 said monday after the ruling			2
" so now we have our answer			0
" " we are not asking to close the courtroom , only to use a pseudonym , " he said			0
his client will still testify , he said , " but at what expense to his emotional well - being ? " he said he expects the defense to attack his client on the basis of a meeting he had with @entity3 in the years after the alleged abuse			1
" my client could n't break free , " said the attorney , describing the relationship between @entity111 and @entity3 as " complex			2
" @entity115 , a former graduate student considered to be another key witness in the @entity3 case , has testified that he alerted @entity25 in 2002 that he 'd seen what appeared to be @entity3 sexually assaulting a boy , an allegation authorities did n't learn of until years later			1
psychologist flagged @entity3 as ' likely pedophile ' in 1998 report but prosecutors said later that the incident took place about a year earlier than what was originally alleged , causing defense attorneys for two former @entity4 officials to argue that one of the charges should now be dropped			1
@entity131 , @entity4 's former athletic director , and @entity133 , a former university vice president who oversaw campus police , have been charged with perjury and failing to report the alleged sexual assault of a child			2
both of them have pleaded not guilty , and their attorneys have said that prosecutors " charged this case before ( they ) knew the facts			1
" after news of the scandal broke last year , the @entity144 published an extensive interview in which @entity3 attempted to clarify his relationships with young people			2
" if i say , ' no , i 'm not attracted to young boys , ' that 's not the truth , " he said , according to the story			0
" because i 'm attracted to young people -- boys , girls -- i ... " his lawyer , who was present at the interview , spoke up at that point to note that @entity3 is " not sexually " attracted to them			1
i enjoy -- that 's what i was trying to say -- i enjoy spending time with young people			0
i enjoy spending time with people , " @entity3 continued			2
" i mean , my two favorite groups are the elderly and the young			0
" @entity0 's @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
