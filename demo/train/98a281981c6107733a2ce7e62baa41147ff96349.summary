@entity7 , @entity5 as @entity4 messages go , @entity1 's speech on national television was almost pitch - perfect			1
highlighting continued economic growth and rising living standard in 2014 , the @entity5 president -- entering the third year into his expected decade - long reign -- said he wanted to " click the ' like ' button " for the country 's 1.3 billion citizens , whose " support for officials at all levels " made such achievements possible			1
@entity1 -- who also heads the ruling @entity19 as well as the world 's largest standing army -- promised deeper reform and the rule of law in the coming year , comparing them to " a bird 's two wings			1
" the 10 - minute prerecorded address ended on an appeal for world peace			0
while he hit all the right notes , @entity1 saved the most dramatic metaphors for his massive anti-corruption campaign			1
the 61 - year - old leader , considered @entity5 's most powerful in decades , reiterated his " zero - tolerance " stance , vowing to keep " waving high the sword against corruption " and " fastening the cage of regulations			1
" for a nation still largely ruled from behind closed doors , however , official pronouncements after a series of year - end leadership meetings have offered better clues on @entity1 's ambitions and priorities in 2015			1
corruption fight in the last week of december , @entity1 presided over the gathering of the 25 - member @entity49 , the @entity19 's elite decision - making body			1
" organizing cliques within the party to run personal businesses is absolutely not tolerated , " read a statement issued after the meeting , while acknowledging the challenges in the ongoing fight against corruption , a lightning rod for mass discontent			2
the past year has certainly seen @entity1 break some powerful cliques involving an intricate web of officials , cronies and tycoons as well as billions of dollars worth of bribes and deals			2
he took down former domestic security czar @entity68 , likely soon to become the most senior @entity5 official ever to face corruption charges ; general @entity75 , once the military 's second - in - command ; and @entity73 , a top aide to ex-president @entity74			1
state media have touted them as the three biggest " tigers " caught in @entity1 's now two - year - old anti-graft campaign , with a stated goal of targeting both " tigers and flies " -- high - and low - ranking officials			1
while applauded by many ordinary citizens , @entity1 's ever - wider dragnet has also attracted increasing scrutiny			1
" the question remains to be whether @entity1 is taking a page from chairman @entity93 , " said longtime political analyst @entity87 with the @entity88 , noting the three fallen leaders were all considered to be @entity1 's political opponents			1
" starting with @entity93 , corruption has been used to take down enemies of the more powerful faction			0
" for the sake of stability within @entity99 , @entity87 predicted a moratorium on the hunt for " big tigers " -- anyone in the rank of a @entity49 member and above -- in the next few years			0

" @entity5 's economic success had relied on some very capable people , who also happened to be corrupt because of the system , " said economist @entity116 , one of the country 's leading liberal voices			1
he pointed to the example of former railway minister @entity123 , who was often credited with turning the country 's high - speed rail network from nonexistent to the world 's largest in a few years			2
@entity123 received a suspended death sentence in 2013 for corruption and abuse of power			2
" now we 're getting rid of all of them , " @entity93 added			0
" the new reality is that officials do n't want kickbacks but also feel no incentive to get anything done			0
" during a three - day economic policy meeting in early december , @entity1 and other top officials acknowledged the prospect of slower growth in 2015 -- probably still at an enviable rate of 7 % , though , according to most analysts			1
the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to more sustainable development , including more " green " growth -- shortly before promulgating the country 's toughest environmental laws in 25 years			2
" the central government finally has the political will to address environmental issues thanks to public awareness of the smog problem , " said @entity149 , a leading environmentalist who directs the @entity150 in @entity7			0
welcoming the new law , @entity149 voiced his lingering concern : " weak enforcement has long been a big problem in @entity5			2
" read more : @entity1 's push to add ' chilli pepper ' to @entity5 's anti-corruption drive master of the nation " the rule of law " has become an unlikely catchphrase in state media since late october , when the @entity169 leadership made it the theme of a major meeting , and declared the importance of upholding the @entity173 that enshrines the respect for human rights			1
" only if the @entity19 rules the country in line with the law , will people 's rights as the master of the nation be realized , " read a communiqu√© released after the gathering known as the @entity179			0
" it 's the rule of law with @entity5 characteristics , " said @entity87 , the @entity186 analyst , before pointing to the @entity19 agency in charge of corruption probes			1
" the @entity192 is a powerful example of the party operating outside the law -- the way it conducts its investigations			0
" the existence of a secretive process -- based on party regulations instead of laws -- faced by accused @entity169 officials has come to light in recent years , amid reports of suspicious deaths of detainees in party investigators ' custody			0
several victims ' families have told @entity6 and other media that their loved ones were subject to lengthy detention and torture for refusing to admit wrongdoings			0
" when the authorities do n't play by the rules , nobody has freedom from fear -- i know i do n't , " said @entity220 , a prominent @entity7 lawyer known for defending politically sensitive cases involving dissidents and activists			0
his current clients include @entity225 , a veteran journalist accused of leaking state secrets , and @entity228 , a famous human rights lawyer who may soon face subversion charges			0
both were detained by police last year around the time of the 25th anniversary of the @entity235 crackdown			0
" i feel obligated to take these cases despite greater government pressure and personal risk , " @entity220 said			0
" the rule of law is reflected in individual cases -- that 's why every case matters			0

one of the hottest topics across @entity5 cyberspace so far in 2015 has been the case of vanishing cleavage in a hit television show called " @entity258			1
" reflecting aesthetics in seventh century @entity264 , the historical drama -- depicting the life of the only woman who ruled @entity5 in her own right -- had featured ample female bosoms before being suddenly pulled off air in late december			2
when the series returned to air on @entity270 , viewers nationwide noticed crudely edited scenes , in which women were only shown in close - up shots to avoid revealing their chests			0
the show 's creators probably should have seen this coming , though , after @entity1 addressed a delegation of actors , dancers and writers in @entity7 last october			1
underscoring the need for art to serve socialism and foster correct worldviews , the president told the artists not to pursue commercial success at the expense of producing work with moral values			2
" popularity should not necessitate vulgarity , " @entity1 said			2
" pure sensual entertainment does not equate spiritual elation			0
" " anybody associated with thought work or ideology or the image of @entity5 -- everything is being squeezed or tightened or limited , " said @entity297 , a leading commentator on @entity5 's media landscape			1
" i think this is connected to @entity1 's idea of the new normal , " he added			1
" these things are going to go on , not just a cyclical campaign -- whether it 's anti-corruption or tightening up on media , ideological issues			0
" already , signs were plenty throughout last year : universities and state - run think tanks warned to toe the party line in their teaching and research , civil rights groups forced to cancel most public events , and @entity322 's popular @entity321 service completely blocked in @entity5			2
all the worrying developments have only confirmed some observers ' grim view on @entity1 's signature political campaign			1
" fighting corruption is necessary , " offered economist @entity93			0
" but it 's a complex issue related to income , education , freedom of speech and the rule of law			0
without fundamental changes in these areas , the campaign wo n't succeed in the long run			0
" " there were expectations that once he consolidated power , he would launch far - reaching reforms -- but the past two years has not been encouraging , " said analyst @entity87			0
" the big question in 2015 is : how will @entity1 use his new - found supreme power ? " read more : @entity1 's success so far : taking control by following @entity347			1
