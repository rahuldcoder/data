sgt. @entity8 was fired from his job as a firearms instructor for the @entity11 on friday after an internal review determined he possessed the paper targets and offered them to fellow officers for use during a firearms training session earlier this month			1
" when informed of the basic facts , ( @entity20 ) found the entire situation unacceptable , " @entity17 , the interim chief executive of the @entity18 , told reporters saturday			0
" it is not the type of behavior that i want a police officer to have on both a personal and professional level			0
i find his conduct intolerable and i demanded that the chief immediately start procedures to terminate this employee			1

in one hand is a can of iced tea and in the pocket is a pack of @entity43 candy , the same items @entity4 was carrying when he was shot and killed last year in a case that has drawn national attention			1
@entity8 , in a video statement posted online , said he bought the targets because the two items -- the @entity43 and iced tea -- were not threatening , which meant the target could be used to help train officers when not to shoot a suspect			1
@entity8 did not say where he bought the targets , but similar ones caused a controversy when they were first sold online a year ago			2
" while others have used it as a novelty , i view it as a tool for scenario - based firearms training , " @entity8 said			1
using " real - life situations " as training scenarios is not uncommon for firearms instructors , he said , and they help teach police how to respond to incidents in the future			1
" the only stupid act i performed was to believe that some of my coworkers would be mature enough and care enough to use a bad situation as a learning tool , " @entity8 said , referring to the @entity4 case			2

he says he shot @entity4 in self - defense			0
@entity8 , who was hired in january 2011 , disputed some of the details @entity85 gave to reporters , including that he offered the targets to other officers to shoot			2
he said he showed them to only one , a fellow sergeant , to find out whether he thought they could be useful training aids			0
@entity8 said he offered one of the targets to the sergeant after the sergeant said his son would " get a kick " out of them			2
instead of taking it , he said , the sergeant took a picture and then used the image to file a complaint about @entity8			0
" to the @entity4 family , i would like to apologize again for those law enforcement officials that chose to use your son 's death as an element for their personal and political gains , " @entity8 said			0
" i assure you that the use of these targets that are in question is to prevent a tragedy from taking place			0
