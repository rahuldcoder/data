-- what 's an atheist scientist like me doing writing good things about religion ? i did n't start out this way			1
as a teenager , i had contempt for religion			1
i was raised @entity9 , but when i read the @entity10 , i was shocked			0
it hardly seemed to me like a good guide for ethical behavior in modern times , what with all the smiting and stoning and genocide , some of it ordered by @entity21			1
in college , i read other holy books , and they did n't make me any more positive toward religion			1
in my 20s , i obtained a ph.d. in social psychology and began to study morality			0
i ignored religion in my studies			2
we do n't need religion to be ethical , i thought			1
and yet , in almost every human society , religion has been intimately tied to ethics			2
was that just a coincidence ? watch @entity38 's @entity37 in my 30s , i began to study the emotion of " moral elevation			1
" that 's the warm , fuzzy feeling you get when you see acts of moral beauty			2
when you see someone do something kind , loyal , or heroic , you feel uplifted			0
you can feel yourself becoming a better person -- at least for a few minutes			0
everyone who has watched an episode of @entity52 knows the feeling , but there was absolutely no scientific research on this emotion			0
studying moral elevation led me to study feelings of awe more generally , and before i knew it , i was trying to understand a whole class of positive emotions in which people feel as though they have somehow escaped from or " transcended " their normal , everyday , often petty self			2
@entity37 : @entity38 on the moral roots of liberals and conservatives i was beginning to see connections between experiences as varied as falling in love , watching a sunset from a hilltop , singing in a church choir , and reading about a virtuous person			1
in all cases there 's a change to the self -- a kind of opening to our higher , nobler possibilities			2
as i tried to make sense of the psychology of these " self - transcendent emotions , " i began to realize that religions are often quite skilled at producing such feelings			0
some use meditation , some use repetitive bowing or circling , some have people sing uplifting songs in unison			2
some religions build awe - inspiring buildings ; most tell morally elevating stories			0
some traditional shamanic rites even use natural drugs			0
but every known religion has some sort of rite or procedure for taking people out of their ordinary lives and opening them up to something larger than themselves			1
it was almost as if there was an " off " switch for the self , buried deep in our minds , and the world 's religions were a thousand different ways of pressing the switch			1
@entity37 : @entity119 on optimism in my @entity37 talk , i wanted to illustrate some of these experiences visually			0
many scientists who write disparagingly about religion focus on the conscious , explicit beliefs in @entity21 and the supernatural			2
i wanted to shift attention away from that aspect of religion onto the more emotional and social aspects			2
whether or not you believe in @entity21 , religions accomplish something miraculous : they turn large numbers of people who are not kin into a group that is able to work together , trust each other , and help each other			1
they are living embodiments of e pluribus unum ( from many , one )			0
no other species on the planet has ever accomplished that			0
bees and ants are great at it , but they can only do it because they are all sisters			0
and this brings us to the most contentious question in the scientific study of religion : is religiosity -- including our tendency to believe in supernatural entities as well as our ability to lose ourselves in religious rites -- an adaptation ? did we evolve to be religious ? @entity37 : @entity159 on everyday moments some biologists , such as @entity162 ( author of " @entity163 " ) , argue that we did not			1
they say that religions are cultural inventions which are costly and destructive for individual believers			0
they say that religions only persist and spread because they get into our minds the way that a virus gets into our bodies			0
once someone believes that he 'll be rewarded for recruiting converts and punished forever in hell for leaving the church , he tends to do things that help the church , even if they hurt him			0
but i find another perspective much more compelling : our minds evolved to be religious in tandem with our cultures			1
cultures evolve in ways that are somewhat analogous to organisms : as long as groups are competing with each other , then features that foster survival and growth tend to spread ; features that are self - destructive become less frequent			1
what atheists can learn from religion cultural groups that found effective ways to bind non-kin together out - competed groups that were less cohesive			1
this is a view put forward originally by @entity199 , but revived in modern times by the biologists @entity202 , at @entity203 , and @entity204 , at @entity205			0
this is a view called " group selection , " because it argues that our genes came down to us today not just because some individuals were more fit than their neighbors , but because some groups were more fit ( more cohesive and cooperative ) than their neighboring groups			1
i 've spent my whole career trying to figure out what morality is and how human beings came to be moral creatures			0
religion , i believe , is an essential piece of the puzzle			0
i 'm still an atheist , but nowadays i 'm one who finds a lot to admire in religion and in religious communities			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity38 .			1

@entity38 : @entity233 , like love and ethical action , offers a way to transcend the self
he says whether you believe or not , religion accomplishes the miracle of group inspiration
@entity38 says religion 's ability to move people makes it an evolutionary advantage for groups
he says our minds evolved to be more religious in tandem with our cultures
