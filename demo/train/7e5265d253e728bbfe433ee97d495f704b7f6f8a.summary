-- we recently learned that @entity3 intelligence agencies had at least three days ' warning that @entity6 president @entity5 was preparing to launch a chemical attack on his own people , but was n't able to stop it			1
at least that 's what an intelligence briefing from the @entity12 reveals			1
with the combined abilities of our national intelligence apparatus -- the @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and all the rest -- it 's not surprising that we had advance notice			1
it 's not known whether the @entity3 shared what it knew			1
more interestingly , the @entity3 government did not choose to act on that knowledge ( for example , launch a pre-emptive strike ) , which left some wondering why			1
there are several possible explanations , all of which point to a fundamental problem with intelligence information and our national intelligence apparatuses			2
the first possibility is that we may have had the data , but did n't fully understand what it meant			1
this is the proverbial connect - the - dots problem			0
as we 've learned again and again , connecting the dots is hard			0
our intelligence services collect billions of individual pieces of data every day			1
after the fact , it 's easy to walk backward through the data and notice all the individual pieces that point to what actually happened			1
before the fact , though , it 's much more difficult			2
the overwhelming majority of those bits of data point in random directions , or nowhere at all			2
almost all the dots do n't connect to anything			2
rather than thinking of intelligence as a connect - the - dots picture , think of it as a million unnumbered pictures superimposed on top of each other			2
which picture is the relevant one ? we have no idea			0
turning that data into actual information is an extraordinarily difficult problem , and one that the vast scope of our data - gathering programs makes even more difficult			2
the second possible explanation is that while we had some information about @entity5 's plans , we did n't have enough confirmation to act on that information			1
this is probably the most likely explanation			0
we ca n't act on inklings , hunches , or possibilities			1
we probably ca n't even act on probabilities ; we have to be sure			1
but when it comes to intelligence , it 's hard to be sure			1
there could always be something else going on -- something we 're not able to eavesdrop on , spy on , or see from our satellites			0
again , our knowledge is most obvious after the fact			2
the third is that while we were sure of our information , we could n't act because that would reveal " sources and methods			1
" this is probably the most frustrating explanation			0
imagine we are able to eavesdrop on @entity5 's most private conversations with his generals and aides , and are absolutely sure of his plans			2
if we act on them , we reveal that we are eavesdropping			2
as a result , he 's likely to change how he communicates , costing us our ability to eavesdrop			2
it might sound perverse , but often the fact that we are able to successfully spy on someone is a bigger secret than the information we learn from that spying			0
this dynamic was vitally important during @entity112 during the war , the @entity113 were able to break the @entity116 encryption machine and eavesdrop on @entity118 military communications			0
but while the @entity120 knew a lot , they would only act on information they learned when there was another plausible way they could have learned it			1
they even occasionally manufactured plausible explanations			0
it was just too risky to tip the @entity118 off that their encryption machines ' code had been broken			0
the fourth possibility is that there was nothing useful we could have done			0
and it is hard to imagine how we could have prevented the use of chemical weapons in @entity6			1
we could n't have launched a pre-emptive strike , and it 's probable that it would n't have been effective			1
the only feasible action would be to alert the opposition -- and that , too , might not have accomplished anything			0
or perhaps there was n't sufficient agreement for any one course of action -- so , by default , nothing was done			1
all of these explanations point out the limitations of intelligence			0
the @entity18 serves as an example			0
the agency measures its success by amount of data collected , not by information synthesized or knowledge gained			1
but it 's knowledge that matters			1
the @entity18 's belief that more data is always good , and that it 's worth doing anything in order to collect it , is wrong			1
there are diminishing returns , and the @entity18 almost certainly passed that point long ago			0
but the idea of trade - offs does not seem to be part of its thinking			0
the @entity18 missed the @entity176 bombers , even though the suspects left a really sloppy internet trail and the older brother was on the terrorist watch list			0
with all the @entity18 is doing eavesdropping on the world , you would think the least it could manage would be keeping track of people on the terrorist watch list			0
i do n't know how the @entity17 measures its success , but it failed to predict the end of the @entity191			0
more data does not necessarily mean better information			1
it 's much easier to look backward than to predict			0
information does not necessarily enable the government to act			1
even when we know something , protecting the methods of collection can be more valuable than the possibility of taking action based on gathered information			1
but there 's not a lot of value to intelligence that ca n't be used for action			1
these are the paradoxes of intelligence , and it 's time we started remembering them			2
of course , we need organizations like the @entity17 , the @entity18 , the @entity19 and all the rest			0
intelligence is a vital component of national security , and can be invaluable in both wartime and peacetime			0
but it is just one security tool among many , and there are significant costs and limitations			0
we 've just learned from the recently leaked " black budget " that we 're spending $ 52 billion annually on national intelligence			0
we need to take a serious look at what kind of value we 're getting for our money , and whether it 's worth it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			2

@entity3 intelligence agencies had some prior warnings about @entity6 's chemical attack
@entity233 : despite the knowledge , the @entity3 was n't able to stop the attack
he says having more data does not necessarily enable government to act meaningfully
@entity233 : the paradox is that a lot of valuable intelligence ca n't be used for action
