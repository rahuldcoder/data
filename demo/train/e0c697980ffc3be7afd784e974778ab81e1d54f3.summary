-- can a photo competition change the world ? probably not , but when paired with the brainpower of @entity5 and the problem - solving capabilities of the world 's most advanced artificially intelligent computer systems , it might just stand a chance			1
last november , @entity5 opened its 12th global research lab -- and first on the @entity12 continent -- in @entity13 , @entity14			1
though the lab employs 25 phds from the world 's best universities , as well as @entity20 -- the @entity22 supercomputer that won @entity23 against human competitors in 2011 -- the company recognized that in order to truly shape innovation in the continent , it had to first hear from the people who live there			1
" if we 're going to solve the grand challenges of @entity39 it has to start here in @entity39 with us identifying and underscoring what they are , " says @entity29 , founder of @entity13 's @entity32 tech hub and ceo of @entity34 , and one of the four photo contest judges			1
to better understand what areas to invest in , @entity5 launched its @entity45 is @entity47 photo competition , which invited anyone with a camera ( or mobile phone ) to contribute images that highlight the continent 's grand challenges , city systems and examples of innovation			1
after three months ( and 1,200 submissions ) , they chose a winner in each of those three categories			1
the competition even succeeded in offering the judges a few surprises			2
" i saw places in @entity70 i did n't even imagine existed , " says @entity65 @entity64 , official photographer for @entity45 is @entity47 project and another judge in the competition			0
" the winners each shared an @entity39 that most of us did n't know or did n't have access to			1
" @entity65 tv producer @entity74 won in the @entity76 category with his image of a woman on the back of a " boda boda , " or bicycle taxi			0
the judges felt the picture demonstrated how locals in @entity14 and @entity85 circumvent an unreliable public transport system to create a more efficient means of getting around			0
mainly , though , it was the strength of the image that they were drawn to			0
" it had the most vibrant colors , and it really summed up @entity39 to me , " admits @entity64			2
see the best photos from the competition here imole " @entity96 " @entity95 won the @entity98 category with " @entity99 , " which highlights the very adult responsibilities imposed on many of @entity70 's children -- either because poverty forces them into jumpstarting their working lives , or because they have to assume the role of caretaker for their siblings			2
visual artist @entity112 won the innovation category , and the competition overall , with " @entity115 , " a shot he took of children playing with scrap in @entity13 's @entity120 slum			2
" we have these big dumping sites in @entity120 , and though we try to prevent the kids going to them , they find a way and use the scrap to play with , " says @entity112 , who also grew up in the area			0
" these kids were playing a role in the television			0
none of them have a tv at home , but here they had a chance to be reporters -- they could be anything they wanted to be within that television			0
i just wanted to capture the happiness in that moment , " he adds			0
see more from @entity39 the competition is part of @entity5 's $ 100 million project @entity143 initiative , which will employ @entity20 and other cognitive computing technologies to advance development and create business opportunities in @entity39 over the next 10 years			1
@entity64 , a former architect and one of the continent 's most respected photographers , says the competition has also shown him how photography has grown in @entity39			1
" i feel like a lot of @entity12 photographers have observed how those in @entity154 and the @entity155 have photographed in @entity39 , and many us still use that as a template of how @entity39 should be captured			1
i think we 're starting to get out of that now , " he says			0
" i think photography is starting to feel more approachable , to include the @entity12 public and focus on the textures and people of @entity39			2
we 're starting to tell stories for @entity12			0
it 's important , because our stories matter , and we need to hear them and to see our heroes so that we can know what is possible			0
