@entity0 , @entity1 -- there are five days left until the opening day of the biggest sporting event @entity1 has ever put on			1
while there is a furious push to finish dozens of projects around the city to try to make it sparkle for the upcoming @entity11 the plight of the smallest and poorest citizens of @entity1 go wholly ignored			1
impoverished children are crawling all over many of the @entity11 related construction sites			1
some sit inches away from speeding cars on mounds of dirt , others walk under massive machinery , and some pick up the tools and bricks around them as their parent work a full day			0
" this is happening all the time and people just turn a blind eye , " said @entity28 in @entity1 @entity29			1
@entity29 says by law the children should not be on construction sites , while they are not normally paid by the contractors , the older children often end up doing work for free just to help their parents			1
" it should n't be happening			0
children should not be there unprotected , unsafe and working			1
" the contractors are supposed to create a safe place for the children near the sites			1
child advocates say that rarely happens			0
instead mother 's hold small babies on their hips while carrying loads of dirt on the their heads , or they put them down on the site surrounded by the dust and danger construction can pose			1
" where can i leave them ? mother @entity60 said with her toddler on her hip			0
" i bring them wherever i go			0
" the workers are normally from the poorest and most desperate parts of @entity1			1
a subcontractor shows up in their villages and offers work in big cities like @entity0			0
there is no work in their villages , so the entire family moves from place to place to sustain themselves			0
" if there is poverty then the kids come themselves , if there is poverty then what else can we do			0
there is nothing in our village , so because of poverty , we 're here			0
she has two young children who on this day were playing in the dirt and with the tools as cars buzz by and @entity94 plowed into the ground with a shovel			2
the scene is repeated on construction sites throughout the city , and by no means is this just on sites related to the @entity11			1
you see children playing , sleeping or sitting on everything from road construction sites to private home construction			1
when the child is old enough like 11 - year - old @entity109 you sometimes see them doing the work			0
we ask @entity109 if he is being paid to pick up bricks on a huge construction area along side a busy @entity0 highway			2
" no. " he said , " i do n't work here but i help my mother			0
" and in so doing the contractor gets free labor , the parents get a helping hand , and the child has something to do			0
but child advocates say this is one step toward child labor continues a cycle of poverty and is simply dangerous for children			2
" what you see at constructions sites , all kinds of hazardous materials , " activist and urban planner @entity132 said			2
" we do n't see too much of deaths but [ we see ] injuries , cuts and certain amounts of a disease like dengue [ and ] stomach borne infections			0
" however there are people trying to do something about the dangerous and illegal position children are being forced into			2
for decades an @entity1 organization called " @entity153 " has been convincing contractors to let them set up day care facilities for children on the construction sites			1
" i would have kept them with me at work but it is not allowed			0
now they have also started go to the school , " a mother of four told @entity2 back in 2008 as she nursed her baby before heading back into @entity164 to continuing laying bricks			0
yet as a whole the police , government officials , and everyday citizens pass by the construction sites everyday and do nothing			1
@entity175 , a subcontractor on one site with a half dozen children on it told @entity2 , " this is just how it is for the poor			1
what safety can there be for the poor ? tell us ? there is no safety for the poor			2
these people do n't have the money to leave their kids at home with servants , and work here			0
" @entity175 's reaction may seem callous but is too often true			2
billions have been spent on beautifying the city because of the games			2
as it turns out the games have also exposed the world to one of @entity1 's ugly problems .			1

@entity1 is rushing to get ready for the @entity11
games construction *highlights* one of @entity1 's problems
children of the poor *swarm* over construction sites
