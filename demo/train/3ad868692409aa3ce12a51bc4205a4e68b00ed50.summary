@entity1 users who stream video to their televisions will be seeing a major overhaul in the next few days			1
the company has announced what it 's calling the biggest update ever for its more than 40 million streaming customers , rolling out a more visually rich design that will be the same regardless of what kind of device is used to bring videos from the internet to the tv			1
" this is the biggest change in how @entity1 looks on a tv , " said @entity15 , @entity1 's vice president of product innovation			1
@entity1 says that the majority of the 1 billion hours of video its users stream each month is viewed on televisions , via tv apps or devices like the @entity24 , blu - ray players or gaming consoles			1
under the new format , which began rolling out wednesday , clicking on a show or movie will call up a full - page description , with multiple images and an explanation of why @entity1 recommended it for you			1
descriptions of the videos will be sharper , @entity1 says , and users who choose to let @entity1 access their social - media profiles will get recommendations based on their activity and friends ' activity , as well as on videos they 've watched in the past			2
until now , most versions of @entity1 streaming looked like a relatively flat grid , consisting of row after row of suggestions based , generally , on what kind of videos had been streamed by the user in the past			2
" the new interface , which has been two years in the making , is a visually striking departure from the familiar grid of movie tiles and boxes , and it is designed to be mirror the experience of tv watching : you click the remote and something happens , " wrote @entity55 in @entity56			2
other new features include expanded support for @entity69 , a way to let people in the same household customize their experience , and support for voice controls on @entity76			0
@entity77 , the feature that automatically starts the next episode of a tv show you 're watching or suggests others when you 're done , also is being redesigned			0
@entity1 says the update will take about two weeks to reach all devices , which include @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity76 , @entity87 3 , and new and future smart tvs and blu - ray players			1
some older smart tvs and @entity92 players may receive the new look if manufacturers update them , and the overhaul will be added for the @entity24 box early next year			0
one set - top box that wo n't be getting the update is @entity99			0
that system has " specific templates that are set by @entity102 , " according to @entity1			0
@entity1 says it has more than 31 million @entity104 subscribers to its streaming service , plus almost 10 million international subscribers .			0
