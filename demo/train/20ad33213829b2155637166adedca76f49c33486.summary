-- she might be the hottest female player on the planet but @entity3 seemed powerless to arrest her miserable run of form against @entity6 at the @entity7 in @entity8			1
the world @entity9 from @entity11 has won just one solitary match against the 15 - time grand slam winner from @entity14 and went down to a 6 - 4 6 - 4 defeat in her second round robin outing			1
for @entity6 , 31 , it represented her third straight win in @entity20 , guaranteeing her a place in the final four of the season - ending $ 4.9 million tournament			1
@entity3 , who saved two match points before beating @entity25 's @entity24 in an epic clash on wednesday night , must now beat @entity28 's @entity27 on friday to make the semifinals			1
and if the 23 - year - old needed any extra motivation , victory should see @entity3 cement her world no. 1 status for the end of the 2012 season			1
" i have been practicing hard and expected to play better , " @entity3 said in a court side interview			2
" hopefully as time goes on , i will get better			0
if not , i hope to play better next year			0
" when i did the right things i was in control much of the time , but i did n't have the consistency today			0
i had too many opportunities i did n't use			0
i will be a little bit sad , but i need to bounce back straight away			2
" i will give everything to win ( on friday )			0
i will give two hundred percent			0
i have another opportunity to stay in the tournament and to keep the dream alive			0
" defeat snapped a 13 - match winning streak for @entity3 after the @entity52 but @entity6 is now unbeaten in 16 clashes against the world 's top five players			1
the @entity14 had already sealed her place in the last four with wins over @entity27 and @entity25 's @entity24			1
@entity27 , the tournament 's lowest ranked player , defeated @entity24 , the no. 5 seed , 6 - 4 6 - 3 in thursday 's opening match to keep alive her hopes of making the semis			1
@entity27 responded to her defeat to @entity6 by brushing aside @entity24 , who was knocked out of the tournament after her epic encounter with @entity3 on wednesday evening			1
@entity24 has now lost all three of her matches , winning just one set in the process , while @entity27 can upset the odds and make the semis by beating @entity3 on friday			1
in the late match on thursday , @entity72 's @entity71 responded after her opening defeat to @entity75 by toppling @entity77 @entity76 6 - 3 2 - 6 6 - 0			1
meanwhile , less than two weeks from the start of the men 's season - ending @entity80 in @entity82 , @entity78 has announced his withdrawal with injury			1
the 11 - time grand slam winner from @entity86 has n't featured on the men 's tour since his surprise defeat to @entity91 @entity90 in the second round at @entity93 back in late june			2
@entity78 , still holding on to his position as world no. 4 , will also miss the @entity97 event prior to @entity82 and is targeting a return at the @entity99 in early 2013			1
he said : " it 's disappointing for me to miss the last two tournaments of the season in @entity103 and @entity82 , but it does n't come as a surprise			2
" i will hopefully resume my tennis practice soon since i am making good progress with my recovery from injury			0
i am not ready to compete in time for these events so i will continue my recovery in @entity112 and work hard to be back as soon as possible			0
" @entity78 's spot in @entity82 will be taken by @entity114 , who assured his place with a 7 - 5 6 - 1 defeat of @entity14 @entity117 at the @entity119 event in @entity120			1
and though the @entity121 was delighted to make the cut , he expressed his sympathy to @entity78 on the @entity125 's official website			2
he said : " i 'm sad for @entity78 , he 's really trying in his comeback			2
but it 's not easy after such a long time away			0
i had the same feeling with my wrist			0
" we miss @entity78 a lot on the @entity125			2
he is one of the best players in history , he will come back strong			0
i 'm sure it will be very soon			0
he will be ready to win a big event again			0
