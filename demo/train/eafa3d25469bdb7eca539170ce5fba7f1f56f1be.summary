-- @entity1 has come a long way			1
once dismissed by hard - core conservative critics as " the divorced , childless , @entity5 woman from @entity6 " , the @entity9 chancellor 's landslide victory in sunday 's @entity11 elections has reinforced her position as the uncontested political leader in @entity6 and the rest of @entity15			1
for a few hours sunday night , @entity1 's center - right @entity18 / @entity17 parties seemed even within striking distance of an absolute majority of seats , a feat only @entity18 " @entity25 " @entity24 achieved in 1957			1
under the rules of @entity6 's complex electoral system , the @entity26 received 41.5 % of the vote but 49.3 % of the seats ( five members short of an absolute majority in the 630 - strong @entity11 )			1
above all , sunday 's elections have confirmed that a vast majority of @entity9 are supportive of @entity36 's handling of the @entity38 sovereign debt crisis -- and specifically , @entity6 providing financial backing in return for structural and fiscal reforms in crisis - hit @entity43 countries			1
in contrast to other major @entity46 leaders who are struggling at home , @entity1 's calm , disciplined and unpretentious approach to governing resonates with many @entity9 voters who feel confident she will protect them against the uncertainties and crises abroad			1
by firmly occupying the @entity9 political center ( " @entity56 " ) @entity1 has successfully marginalized the @entity59 / @entity58 opposition parties ( she even decided to phase out nuclear power )			2
add to that @entity6 's strong economic performance and low unemployment figures and you have the secret recipe behind the success of @entity1			1
even @entity18 / @entity17 party insiders were surprised at the magnitude of her election victory ( an increase of 7.7 percentage points compared to 2009 ) , especially since successive bail - out packages , the @entity74 's aggressive bond buying , as well as the @entity76 fund have increased @entity6 's @entity43 liability exposure to hundreds of billions of @entity79			2
in late august , @entity9 finance minister @entity80 , a close @entity1 ally , caused some political consternation within the center - right camp when he alluded to the possibility that @entity6 may need to sign off on a third bailout package for @entity85			2
@entity80 's comments , while politically risky , seemed to confirm what many economists have suspected all along : namely that the @entity85 drama is not over , that @entity90 will ultimately need significant debt forgiveness to regain its footing , and that there are other @entity43 countries -- ranging from @entity95 to @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 -- that will soon be asking for more ( @entity9 ) money			0
yet sunday , even the resurgent anti-euro " @entity101 , " or @entity101 , party missed the 5 % threshold needed to enter parliament , thus providing relief among international investors that @entity36 is not beginning to pull the financial plug on the rest of @entity15 any time soon			0
quite to the contrary , since the demoralized pro-business @entity109 party failed to enter the @entity11 for the first time since 1949			0
@entity1 will now have to find a new coalition partner and could theoretically either join forces with the @entity116 , known as the @entity59 , or the @entity117			0
both opposition parties have frequently criticized the outgoing center - right government for putting too much emphasis on austerity rather than on growth measures to kick - start the fledgling @entity43 economies			0
the @entity59 and @entity117 are also strong supporters of the controversial eurobonds that have been categorically rejected by @entity1 for fear they would remove all incentives for individual @entity38 countries to get their fiscal and economic houses in order			2
while @entity1 is going to stand firm in her opposition to @entity125 a new @entity9 government with either the @entity116 or the @entity117 on board would be more open to making concessions on the planned @entity38 banking union , especially regarding the proposed single resolution authority mechanism to be placed within the @entity74			0
pretty much everything will depend on the internal horse - trading during the upcoming coalition talks between @entity18 / @entity17 and @entity59 and @entity117 , respectively			0
ultimately , most political observers agree that @entity1 's next government ( and her last since she has already said she wo n't run again in 2017 ) will probably be a relaunch of the @entity144 with the @entity59 that she led during 2005 - 2009			1
while the @entity59 is rather reluctant to enter into such a deal ( after all , it scored its worst post-war result in the 2009 elections ) , the party knows full well that a @entity144 is the preferred option for a majority of @entity9 voters			0
in theory , getting the @entity59 on board should also help @entity1 break the political gridlock that has gripped @entity9 politics since the opposition @entity59 , @entity58 and left parties retain control of @entity6 's upper chamber ( the @entity158 ) , which nowadays needs to approve about half of all @entity9 laws			1
from an @entity163 perspective , the re-election of @entity1 is definitely good news and promises a certain stability and continuity in an otherwise rather weak and fluid @entity38 political leadership landscape			0
in principle , the chancellor 's commitment to free trade should also provide valuable political cover for the planned @entity163 - @entity174 @entity173 at a time when protectionist sentiments are running high , especially in @entity177 and the @entity38 countries			0
that being said , as evidenced by the @entity181 crisis , a future @entity1 administration that includes either the @entity59 or the @entity117 would probably be even more reluctant to use military force abroad than the outgoing center - right coalition government			0
@entity1 's victory in the 2013 @entity11 elections is of historic proportions			1
political commentators are already speaking about " the era of @entity1 " and note that the woman who spent well over half of her adult life in @entity6 is even beginning to eclipse her one - time mentor chancellor @entity193 , the father of @entity6 's reunification in 1990			2
the next four years will determine whether @entity1 's leadership and handling of the @entity43 crisis will keep the @entity38 project together			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

@entity1 's parties scored big victories in sunday 's @entity11 elections
@entity201 : @entity1 's calm , unpretentious approach and strong economy help her cause
he says @entity1 has *walked* fine line , propping up @entity79 , without losing *popularity* at home
