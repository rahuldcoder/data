@entity0 -- the @entity2 continued to be rocked thursday by allegations of its agents ' transgressions , though one @entity8 government official cautioned against assuming there are systemic problems or that they are not properly investigated			1
the new claims include an account stemming from @entity13 described by @entity1 affiliate @entity16 tv station @entity15 as very similar to the @entity18 prostitution scandal purportedly involving members of the @entity2 and other government agencies			1
the @entity8 government official acknowledged there had been missteps among @entity2 members , while adding that such problems are to be expected given the agency 's 147 - year history			1
amid calls by some republicans for a broader congressional - led investigation , the official was also quick to defend the government 's internal review process and the role of the @entity2 's @entity35 in dealing with that agency			2
" we have had employees that have engaged in misconduct , " the official said			0
" reports of other incidents involving members of the agency , which is charged with protecting the president and other top officials , as well as investigating criminal activity , have been brought to @entity51 , a congressional source said thursday			2
that includes the incident in @entity13 , which the congressional source said the @entity2 has told @entity51 it is looking into as well			1
the @entity15 report cited an unnamed @entity8 government contractor who worked extensively with the @entity2 advance team in @entity58 before president @entity60 's trip there in march 2011			1
the source said he was with about a dozen @entity2 agents and a few @entity8 military specialists at a strip club in the city a few days before @entity60 arrived			1
@entity68 investigation not over , @entity2 says the men drank heavily at the club , and most of them paid extra for access to a vip section where they were provided sexual favors in return for cash , the source told the station			1
the station reported that the strip club 's owner corroborated the allegations			1
the owner confirmed that a large number of agents , and some military escorts , " descended on his club " that week and were there at least three nights in a row , @entity15 reported			1
the owner said his club routinely takes care of high - ranking employees of the @entity96 in @entity58 as well as visiting agents from the @entity98 and @entity99 , @entity15 said			1
the owner said his reputation for " security " and " privacy " makes his strip club popular with " those who want to be discreet			1
" the government contractor source said he told the agents it was a " really bad idea " to take the strippers back to their hotel rooms , but several agents bragged that they " did this all the time " and " not to worry about it , " @entity15 reported			1
@entity15 investigative reporter @entity113 told the @entity115 show " @entity116 " on thursday that he considers his source very credible , and he later told @entity1 that he had checked billing records , receipts , credentials and other information to confirm the contractor was with the @entity2 in @entity123 at the time of the incident			1
the source told him about the alleged scandal last year , while @entity113 was in @entity13 on a different story			2
@entity113 said he pressed for details at that time , but the man did n't want any information from him to be used then in a news story			0
after the allegations involving @entity2 agents in @entity18 surfaced , @entity133 again pressed his source , who this time assented to the use of his account in the @entity15 report			1
@entity1 can not independently confirm the allegations			0
responding to the @entity15 report , @entity2 spokesman @entity143 said , " the recent investigation in @entity68 ( @entity18 ) has generated several news stories that contain allegations by mostly unnamed sources			1
any information brought to our attention that can be assessed as credible will be followed up on in an appropriate manner			0
" defense secretary @entity152 said thursday that his department is not investigating any of its troops about the reported incident in @entity13			2
but the @entity157 is questioning its @entity13 embassy staff about the allegations , spokeswoman @entity156 said thursday			2
the @entity99 also is prepared to look into , " in an appropriate manner and immediately , " allegations that it deems " credible " regarding its agents in @entity13 , agency spokesman @entity160 said			2
but he added that , while the @entity99 has seen news reports , " we are unaware of any allegations of misconduct			0
" sen. @entity169 -- the top @entity170 in his chamber 's @entity171 , which was briefed wednesday by @entity174 secretary @entity173 on the @entity18 scandal -- said the @entity15 report " only reaffirms the need for independent investigations by the ( @entity174 's independent ) inspector general			2
" " there are rumors flying about various incidents over several years about the conduct of @entity2 personnel , as well as other law enforcement and military personnel in locations around the world , " the @entity179 @entity170 said			2
" the only way to put to rest the rumors of a much wider problem is for the allegations to receive transparent and independent reviews			0
" another @entity170 on that committee , sen. @entity194 of @entity195 , called for @entity51 itself to investigate " as part of our oversight responsibilities			0
" but sen. @entity200 , a @entity202 @entity201 and @entity171 member , disagreed and said @entity205 's investigation needs to come first			0
" after that , @entity51 should look into it and see what went wrong and what could be changed , " he said			0
the @entity210 reported thursday that an unnamed source said such behavior is part of the culture at the @entity2 and not a one - time occurrence			0
@entity205 : @entity60 has full confidence in director the @entity2 said it has no comment on the @entity210 story , but a @entity2 official , who was not authorized to comment on the continuing investigation , said , " it 's difficult for the @entity2 to defend against this , " referring to the @entity210 's article			0
" the reaction by our leadership speaks for itself , " the official told @entity1 , referring to the @entity18 incident			0
" everyone was sent home			0
we have taken action regarding the agents			0
" spokesman @entity236 said thursday that the @entity237 would not comment on unconfirmed reports about other incidents , saying questions should be directed to the @entity2			2
the alleged prostitution scandal in @entity18 occurred before the president 's trip this month to a @entity245 summit in @entity68			0
@entity2 and @entity8 military members are said to have consorted with prostitutes			2
nine @entity2 members have resigned or are being forced out as a result of the scandal			1
the military has launched its own investigation into 12 troops who were in @entity18 in advance of @entity60 's visit			0
the @entity256 said thursday that the latest soldier included in this inquiry had " duty at the @entity260 , " which is part of the military			0
fresh off a meeting with @entity2 director @entity264 , rep. @entity262 told @entity1 's " @entity273 " on thursday that she 's learned the agency -- besides setting up working groups focused on its culture and outreach efforts , including to women -- will institute several measures in light of the uproar			1
these include having a " professional development or personnel officer ( go ) on every trip the agents take out of the country , " barring agents from being " associated with any place of bad acts " such as strip clubs and mandating that " no foreign nationals will be allowed in " an agent 's hotel room			1
" if this is the culture , then they want to immediately put it to rest , " the @entity195 @entity201 said , explaining the @entity2 's rationale			0
@entity1 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			0
