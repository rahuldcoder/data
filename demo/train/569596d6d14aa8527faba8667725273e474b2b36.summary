@entity0 -- a huge collection of papers belonging to pioneering scientist sir @entity4 -- the father of gravity -- has been posted online by @entity6			1
the archive includes @entity4 's college notebooks and some of his most important writings from the 1660s on mathematics and calculus , optics and gravity			1
they appear alongside an annotated copy of " @entity17 , " the book in which @entity4 set out his laws of motion and gravity , and which is regarded as one of the world 's most significant scientific works			2
more than 4,000 pages of @entity4 material have been digitized so far , with archivists photographing and uploading as many as 200 pages a day			1
@entity30 , the library 's digitization manager , said the collection contained " perhaps some of the most important papers and documents in the history of science , " which would give viewers a valuable insight into @entity4 's working methods			1
" anyone , wherever they are , can see at the click of a mouse how @entity4 worked and how he went about developing his theories and experiments , " he said			0
" before today , anyone who wanted to see these things had to come to @entity6			0
now we 're bringing @entity50 to the world			0
" many of the papers -- some of them badly damaged by fire or water -- have undergone delicate conservation work before being added to the archive			0
they are also accompanied by transcriptions by the @entity60 's @entity59 , allowing readers to decipher @entity4 's handwriting			2
but some of the notes added to the papers over the years suggest some of the scientist 's contemporaries may not have approved of the online publication			0
several of the manuscripts contain the line " not fit to be printed , " written by @entity71 , who was asked to review @entity4 's work after his death			1
the @entity4 archive is part of @entity6 's @entity77 project that will eventually showcase other important scientific papers , including the works of @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
part of @entity80 's personal library of hundreds of books -- many of them packed with the scientist 's notes in the margins -- is already online			0
you can view the @entity4 archive online at the @entity93 .			2
