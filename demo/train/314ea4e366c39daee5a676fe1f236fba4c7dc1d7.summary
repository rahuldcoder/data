-- thousands of registered sex offenders have received @entity3 passports , including at least 30 federal employees , according to a @entity6 report obtained by @entity0			1
the @entity6 report said the @entity8 can not legally deny passports to registered sex offenders , except those specifically convicted of sex tourism			1
the report concluded that about 4,500 @entity3 passports of the more than 16 million issued in fiscal year 2008 were issued to registered sex offenders			1
" federal statutes authorize the secretary of state to deny issuance of a passport in certain circumstances , such as while an individual is imprisoned or on parole or supervised release for a conviction for international drug trafficking or sex tourism or is in arrearages for child support , " the report states			2
" however , there is currently no comprehensive program to deny passports to applicants who are registered sex offenders			1
" the @entity8 called the report " very misleading " and adding it " conveys more ' shock value ' than factual accuracy			1
" in a written response , the department pointed out that only a fraction of 1 percent of the 16 million passports issued in fiscal year 2008 went to registered sex offenders			1
in addition , the title of the report " fails to convey that @entity6 found no lawful reasons for the department to deny or revoke the passports of the case study sex offenders based on their status as sex offenders			1
" " the report appears to suggest , without any foundation , that the @entity8 's issuance of passports to certain @entity3 facilitated their commission of sex crimes abroad , " the department 's response said			2
" there are no facts in the report which show that any of the thirty individuals included in the case studies used his passport to travel to a foreign country to commit a sex crime			0
" the original title of the report , " passports issued to @entity70 , " was later changed to " @entity67 in @entity68			0
" the @entity6 report was requested by sen. @entity72 , @entity73 , and sen. @entity74 , @entity75			0
the @entity6 studied data from the @entity77 ( @entity77 )			0
however , the approximately 4,500 sex offenders who received passports in fiscal year 2008 " is likely understated because many of the records in the passport database and the @entity77 lacked valid @entity82 numbers ... in addition , the @entity77 does not currently contain a comprehensive listing of all sex offenders from the states			1
" the @entity6 found cases that include a sex offender from @entity91 who received a passport while in prison , a @entity95 man with multiple sex convictions who traveled to the @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 since receiving his passport , and a @entity103 man who has traveled to the @entity98 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
among the federal employees who received passports was an aerospace engineer with @entity110 , an employee of the @entity112 , and a @entity114 carrier who traveled to @entity116 and @entity117 after receiving his passport			2
about 50 of those who received passports either lived outside the @entity3 or " their whereabouts were unknown , " the report said			0
a new law took effect in december 2008 that prohibits anyone convicted of sex tourism from receiving a @entity3 passport			1
however , the report said , the @entity8 was not even aware of the law until april of this year after the @entity6 " brought this statute to its attention			2
" " when @entity134 passes a law and the president signs it , then the @entity133 needs to execute it , " @entity72 said in a statement			0
" i 'm shocked that @entity6 had to inform the @entity8 that @entity134 made individuals convicted of sex tourism ineligible for passports back in december 2008			1
it 's inexcusable that the @entity8 did nothing to enforce that provision for 14 months			0
since someone who is late on child support payments can not receive a passport , then surely these criminals should also be stopped from traveling internationally			0
" " it also is disturbing that the @entity6 found examples prior to that new law where the @entity8 issued passports to convicted sex offenders who fled law enforcement , received government housing subsidies , and work for the @entity154			1
this report raises a lot of serious questions about how effectively the government protects us from child predators , " @entity72 said			0
the report also studied a group of registered sex offenders -- many who held positions of public trust , including a school teacher , religious layman , and health care provider			2
" other cases involve registered sex offenders who owe child support or are currently in prison or whose whereabouts are unknown , " the report said			2
" ... several of our cases showed that sex offenders left the country and moved to @entity179			0
according to @entity8 officials , @entity179 does not have a sex offense registration system , so these offenders are likely unknown to authorities and their neighbors			0
" the @entity8 " has indicated that it would like to study any proposed legislation to provide additional authority to deny passports to sex offenders , including constitutional , policy and practical issues that may arise in its application and use , " the report said			1
" a state official said that the department recently began working with [ the @entity197 ] to develop a procedure for tracking these convictions and a procedure to notify @entity8 of those convictions			0

the @entity6 says about 4,500 registered sex offenders received @entity3 passports in fiscal year 2008
at least 30 federal employees who are registered sex offenders obtained @entity3 passports
the @entity8 can only deny passports to those convicted of sex tourism
the @entity8 says @entity6 report has " more ' shock value ' than factual accuracy "
