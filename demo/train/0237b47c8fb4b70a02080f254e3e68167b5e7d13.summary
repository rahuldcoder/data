-- formal trial proceedings against the alleged planners of the 9/11 atrocities have finally begun			1
@entity4 and four co-defendants were arraigned on capital charges before a military judge in @entity8 , @entity9 , on saturday			1
the @entity11 administration claims that its improved military commission rules ensure a fair and credible trial			1
but outside the @entity15 , who will view a @entity15 military trial and potential execution of our enemies as credible ? doubters will have ample reason for skepticism : if there is indeed sufficient evidence of the defendants ' guilt , why not try them before the same civilian courts that try homegrown terrorists like @entity30 bomber @entity29 ? resorting to trial by military commission amounts to an admission that the government is unwilling to take the risk of proving the 9/11 defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt , under the same rules that apply to trials of heinous criminals			1
if we want to hand @entity43 a re-energizing martyrdom , this may be a good way to do it			0
doubts will be magnified by the fact that the @entity11 administration initially planned to try the defendants in federal court in @entity49			0
it backed down only under intense political pressure			0
so the decision to try one of the most important crimes in @entity15 history before a military commission was made for reasons of politics , not justice			1
the @entity62 's military commissions web site is headlined , " @entity63			2
" all three are dubious			0
the rules overlook forests of unfairness for trees of trivia			0
for example , after the government held the 9/11 defendants incommunicado in @entity74 " black sites " for years , without access to lawyers , family or the @entity78 , and then imprisoned them without trial for five more years at @entity8 , it seems ludicrous that it had to arraign them in an unusual saturday session , in order to comply with a rule requiring their arraignment within 30 days of being charged			1
@entity86 also took a hit on saturday			2
during their long imprisonment , the 9/11 defendants say , they were repeatedly tortured or otherwise abused			2
@entity4 , for example , was subjected to " water board " torture 183 times , according to a former @entity74 official			0
yet none of this could be mentioned at the arraignment			0
one defendant refused to enter the courtroom voluntarily and so was brought in shackled to a chair			0
when his military defense counsel , capt. @entity102 , explained that his client was reacting to longstanding abuse , the audio feed to press observers in the @entity15 was cut			1
apparently @entity102 had dared to say the word " torture			0
" the military judge admonished him not to cross over the line of what could be said in open court			2
finally , and above all , justice will be cheated at this trial			1
for example , although the rules now prohibit admission of statements obtained by torture or by cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , the rules still allow admission of evidence derived from statements made under torture , so long as a military judge concludes that admission is " consistent with the interests of justice			1
" it did not have to be this way			0
there are better ways to reconcile the competing demands of justice for 9/11 victims and their families , versus justice for defendants who have been detained and allegedly brutalized for years in violation of standards recognized by international law			1
one way might have been to let the defendants pursue their torture claims through separate lawsuits against the @entity146 administration officials who authorized their alleged mistreatment			0
but @entity15 courts have blocked these lawsuits on the ground that the officials enjoy immunity from such suits			1
another way might have been to refer the 9/11 prosecutions to an international criminal court whose judgments would have more credibility in the world in general , and in the @entity161 world in particular			0
@entity15 officials have raised objections to the @entity164			2
but the @entity164 is not the only such court			0
the @entity15 has supported the @entity166 , where former @entity168 tyrant @entity167 was recently convicted , and the @entity169 , which has indicted individuals for the assassination in 2005 of former @entity173 prime minister @entity172			2
granted , every approach has its drawbacks			0
but the @entity15 has settled on the worst alternative of all : military trials			1
as a former lawyer in the @entity180 , i know that military trials -- of @entity15 service personnel -- can be scrupulously fair			1
however , as the common law maxim states , justice must not only be done , it must be seen to be done			0
in the long view of history , and around the world , justice will not be seen to be done if convictions and death sentences are imposed on our alleged enemies by a @entity15 military court			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

military trial of the alleged planners of the 9/11 attacks on @entity15 began on saturday
@entity197 : trying them in a @entity15 military commission will not be seen as credible
he asks , why not try them before the same civilian courts that try homegrown terrorists ?
@entity197 : the decision to use a military trial was made for reasons of politics , not justice
