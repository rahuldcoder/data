-- @entity1 opened the first @entity3 family - planning clinic in 1916 , and nothing would be the same again			2
since then the growing proliferation of birth control methods has had an awesome effect on both sexes and led to a sea change in moral values			2
and as i 've grown older over the past five decades -- from 1960 to 2010 -- and lived through this revolutionary period in female sexuality , i 've seen how it has altered @entity3 society -- for better or worse			1
on the upside , by the early 60 's @entity17 had made it easier for a woman to choose to delay having children until after she established herself in a career			1
nonetheless , for young women of childbearing age ( i was one of them ) there was a need for some careful soul searching -- and consideration about the long - range effects of oral contraceptives -- before addressing this very personal decision			1
it was a decision i too would have to face when i discovered i was pregnant at age 19			2
even though i was married to the baby 's father , @entity34 , i was n't prepared for this development			1
it meant i would have to put my career ambitions on hold			2
but " the choice " was not mine alone to make			1
i had always wanted to have @entity34 's babies , but was n't at all sure how he would react			1
at the time , we were 19 - year - old newlyweds , struggling to make ends meet			2
but he was unflinching in his desire to keep our baby and his positive , upbeat attitude about the whole prospect turned everything around			0
i have always loved @entity34 for how he responded in that moment			1
during my pregnancy , i came to realize that this process was not about me			0
i was just a spectator to the metamorphosis that was happening inside my womb so that another life could be born			1
it came down to an act of self - sacrifice , especially for me , as a woman			0
but both of us were fully involved , not just for that moment , but for the rest of our lives			0
you may think you can skirt around the issue and dodge the decision , but i 've never known anyone who could			0
@entity34 and i had two beautiful children who 've been an ongoing blessing to both of us			1
later , i would strike out on my own , with my little ones , as a single mother to pursue a career in the movies			0
it was far from ideal , but my children did n't impede my progress			0
they grounded me in reality and forced me into an early maturity			0
i should add that having two babies did n't destroy my figure			0
but if i 'd had a different attitude about sex , conception and responsibility , things would have been very different			1
one significant , and enduring , effect of @entity17 on female sexual attitudes during the 60 's , was : " now we can have sex anytime we want , without the consequences			1
hallelujah , let 's party ! " it remains this way			0
these days , nobody seems able to " keep it in their pants " or honor a commitment ! raising the question : is marriage still a viable option ? i 'm ashamed to admit that i myself have been married four times , and yet i still feel that it is the cornerstone of civilization , an essential institution that stabilizes society , provides a sanctuary for children and saves us from anarchy			1
in stark contrast , a lack of sexual inhibitions , or as some call it , " sexual freedom , " has taken the caution and discernment out of choosing a sexual partner , which used to be the equivalent of choosing a life partner			1
without a commitment , the trust and loyalty between couples of childbearing age is missing , and obviously leads to incidents of infidelity			0
as a result of the example set by their elders , by the 1990s teenage sexual promiscuity -- or hooking up -- with multiple partners had become a common occurrence			2
many of my friends who were parents of teenagers sat in stunned silence several years ago when it came to light that oral sex had become a popular practice among adolescent girls in middle schools across the country			2
the 13 - year - old daughter of one such friend freely admitted to performing fellatio on several boys at school on a regular basis			0
" aw come on , @entity154			0
it 's no big deal			0
everyone is doing it , " she said			0
apparently , since it 's not the act of intercourse , kids do n't count it as sex			2
can any sane person fail to make a judgment call about that ? seriously , folks , if an aging sex symbol like me starts waving the red flag of caution over how low moral standards have plummeted , you know it 's got ta be pretty bad			1
in fact , it 's precisely because of the sexy image i 've had that it 's important for me to speak up and say : come on girls ! time to pull up our socks ! we 're capable of so much better			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			1

@entity181 : the @entity17 has altered society in ways good and bad
an upside has been *empowerment* of women in life decisions
@entity34 : @entity190 is loss of caution and discernment in choice of sex partners
