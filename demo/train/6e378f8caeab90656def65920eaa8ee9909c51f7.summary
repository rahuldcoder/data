her @entity1 video started out innocently enough			1
the @entity4 teen , her face obscured from the camera , held a stack of cards each filled with messages in black marker			1
" i 've decided to tell you about my never ending story , " the card in @entity13 's hands read			1
at this point the viewer may have no idea that they are about to be led on the most agonizing journey , one that pushed the premier of @entity23 to issue a stern warning against bullying , a journey that has birthed a @entity28 page with thousands of people commenting and many offering condolences			1
in the soundless , black and white video , the teen showed one card after another			1
each card painfully sinking the viewer deeper into the anguish too many teens have experienced			1
" in 7th grade i would go with friends on webcam , " the card in the teen 's hand read			1
are depressed kids bully magnets ? the next few cards reveal that the teen began to get attention on the internet from people that she did not know			1
people who told her she was beautiful , stunning , perfect			1
" they wanted me to flash			1
so i did one year later , " the cards said			1
the teen then got a message on @entity28 from a stranger who said she needed to show more of herself or he would publish the topless pictures he had taken of her			1
" he knew my address , school , relatives , friends , family , names ... " video : @entity69 bullied during anti-bullying interview on @entity73 break , the police came to her home to tell her that photos of her were sent to " everyone			1
" she pushed the next card very close to the camera			1
" i then got really sick anxiety major depression and panic disorder			2
i then moved and got into alcohol and drugs			2
" she says she struggled with anxiety , rarely went out for a year			2
and then the same man appeared again with a @entity28 page that displayed her topless as his profile picture			1
" cried every night , lost all my friends and respect people had for me ... again ... " she was teased and felt as if she could never erase that photo			2
she started cutting , a form of self - injuring act that psychologists say is an impulse - control behavior that sometimes accompanies a variety of mental illnesses			2
at school , she ate lunch alone until she moved to another new school			2
" everything was better even though i sat still alone , " the next card read			2
" after a month later i started talking to an old guy friend			2
" @entity106 : being bullied is hell , but life gets better she thought the guy liked her even though she knew he had a girlfriend			2
one day he asked her to come over because his girlfriend was on vacation			2
" so i did ... huge mistake ... i thought he liked me , " she held the cards in one shaky hand now , using the other to brush under her eye as if wiping away a tear			0
a week later the guy 's girlfriend showed up at her school with a posse of 15 others			0
the girlfriend berated her screaming that nobody liked her			0
" a guy than ( sic ) yelled just punch her already ... " she was punched			0
" i felt like a joke in this world i thought nobody deserves this , " the next card reads			0
" teachers ran over but i just went and layed in a ditch and my dad found me			0
" when she got home she drank bleach			0
" it killed me inside and i thought i actually was going to die			0
" in a wired world , children unable to escape cyberbullying she was rushed to a hospital to flush the chemical out of her			0
she put the next card almost flush with camera so that the viewer can no longer see her and only sees " after i got home all i saw on @entity28 - she deserved it and did you wash the mud out of your hair ? i hope she is dead			0
" she moved in with her mother in another city , to another school			0
but her past followed her			0
" 6 months has gone by ... people are pasting pics of bleach , clorex ( sic ) and ditches ... everyday i think why am i still here , " her struggles with anxiety and cutting had gotten worse and even despite counseling and antidepressants she still was rushed to hospital again after an overdose			0
the last cards say simply : " i have nobody			0
" the video has garnered the attention of many including the premier of @entity23 , @entity182			1
" no one deserves to be bullied			0
no one asks for it			0
it is not a rite of passage			0
every child has to feel safe at school , " @entity191 said in a @entity1 video posted thursday			1
one day earlier , @entity13 's body was found in her home , police in the @entity197 - area city of @entity198 said			0
