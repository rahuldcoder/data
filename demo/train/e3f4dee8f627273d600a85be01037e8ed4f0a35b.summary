-- @entity1 on wednesday unveiled @entity2 , its consumer - focused telepresence offering that lets people connect to each other using videoconferencing on their hd television in their living rooms			1
@entity2 ( pronounced you - me ) is a telecommunications system that requires a mix of @entity1 hardware and hardware you 'll already need to own			1
the @entity2 service includes a @entity1 - issued high - definition camera with an embedded microphone , a set - top box , and a remote , but you 'll need your own @entity21 ( 1080p ) and internet connection to use it			1
there is no external microphone , but you can recalibrate the audio quality			1
@entity1 's algorithms cancel external noice and bring the voices in the foreground			2
video calls and video messages are at the center of the @entity2 service , but the remote will also let customers manage their contact list , profiles , and settings			1
in addition , @entity39 will also record videos capable of being uploaded to @entity42 and @entity43 , or attached in an e-mail message			1
@entity39 's @entity46 element is also strong , with the ability to place and receive video calls from friends and family from other programs equipped with @entity46 video calling , specifically @entity54 video chat			0
in addition , @entity39 has certain user controls that will allow owners to block unwanted callers , and lock the @entity59 so that others ca n't use it in your absence			0
there 's also a privacy shutter that clicks off the camera and goes into audio - only mode for those moments that are n't fit to be viewed			1
if 1080p is n't available , @entity39 will adapt the bandwidth to drop down to 720p or even 480p quality			2
as analysts predicted , the hardware alone will cost $ 599 , with a $ 24.99 monthly service fee			2
@entity1 will make @entity2 available on november 14 at @entity74 , with preorders beginning today			0
the hardware components will also be available at @entity78 theater			0
in addition , @entity1 and @entity79 will bring @entity39 to @entity82 fiber - optic network customers early in 2011			2
peripherals maker @entity83 has its own hd video - calling product coming out today at the company 's announcement of @entity88 with @entity88			1
" we believe consumers want the best and most seamless experience which means hd video calling not only from tv to tv , but also tv to pc or @entity99 ( or vice versa ) , " @entity89 , vp and general manager of @entity83 's video business , said in a statement			2
" we also believe consumers will want a free service and one that is integrated into a broader entertainment experience , which is why @entity83 is excited to introduce an integrated hd video calling offering with @entity88			1
" @entity1 will market its @entity2 system with a mall tour to give prospective customers a chance to try the product hands - on			0
the $ 600 price point could be a hard sell for casual users accustomed to free @entity46 services like @entity114			0
in addition , @entity1 will likely air commercials featuring @entity118 actress @entity117 , in a reprisal of her role in a series of ads to promote @entity1 's telepresence for business			0
in reaction to @entity1 's @entity39 , @entity114 invoked @entity126 , the essence of which is that technology gets faster , smaller , and cheaper over time			0
" buy a $ 599 device and it can be subject to obsoletism at the hands of mass - market options that sell for 1/2 , then 1/4 , and eventually 1/10 the price			0
and , when unbeatable lower cost , high performance options are readily available , spending at the top - end can be like throwing money away , especially if you are buying a video calling system and there is no one else to call , " @entity114 's @entity135 said in a blog post			1
