@entity0 -- if keeping track of friends was the first wave of social media , the next may be all about hooking up with strangers			1
apps designed to connect like - minded people , both online and in the real world , are being promoted as potentially capable of generating the kinds of billions @entity12 may or may not be worth			1
but to achieve this , tech companies must encourage users to make a leap into an unknown world and throw private information into a void			1
" if we get this right , i can not think of a bigger thing to be working on right now , " said @entity20 , ceo of @entity21 , one of the most buzzed - about of such apps to emerge this year			1
" we can take billions and billions of dollars			2
" like other so - called " social discovery " apps , highlight works by allowing a small online cloud of personal information to follow a user wherever their cellphone goes			1
whenever two users pass in the street or walk into the same venue , highlight compares their data and alerts them to things they share in common , such as friends , music or favorite tv shows			1
why faces matter to @entity12 @entity20 , 32 , sees this as a powerful way to solve an imperfect social world in which many people try but fail to find the right friends , partners or employees			1
" there is serendipity everywhere , " he told @entity1 this week at @entity0 , a tech conference that wraps up wednesday			2
the event brings together some of the biggest names in social media innovation and its agenda showcases a number of data services which , like @entity21 , attempt to steer us away from the vagaries of chance			2
" but sometimes it just needs more engineering , " he added			2
@entity20 is clearly not alone in thinking this			0
since its launch in january , highlight has received positive reviews from tech - industry journalists and was one of the most heavily hyped apps this spring at @entity74 , the tech conference in @entity76 , @entity77			1
a similar app , @entity79 , was snapped up by @entity12 in may			1
@entity20 wo n't disclose how many people have signed up for @entity21 to date , but our tests in @entity0 this week revealed a relatively thin pool of users			1
( for context , another fledgling rival , @entity86 , hit 1 million users in april			1
) he appears to be some way off from the fabled " critical mass " at which a network becomes an attractive user destination			0
to get there , he must first convince people of the value of sharing -- a task he acknowledges as tricky			0
" people freak out , they say it 's creepy , " he said			1
" and if they do n't want to share , then that 's fine , they do n't have to			0
but the social benefits to this far outweigh any cost to privacy			0
" @entity20 , who is currently expanding @entity21 's two - man operation with half a dozen new hires , said he believes users will be won over by the ability to validate peoples ' identities via @entity12 or other existing social media platforms , and by the limited space in which the data is broadcast			1
@entity12 to show you adds based on your web browing " we connect people over a 150 - meter radius			1
there 's something about a short sense of space that creates trust , " he said			0
we think about it all the time and we want to be a simple product that people love			0
we do n't want to be too spammy , too aggressive or anything like that			0
" @entity20 said he is not entirely sure how he will monetize his creation			0
still , he is confident that it has lucrative potential -- provided it can avoid being pigeonholed as a dating app or conference - networking tool			2
" both those are big markets , but if you focus on them you end up with a very vertical growth plan , " @entity20 said			0
" we want to go beyond that			0
we want something that everyone will use everywhere			0
" while some may doubt @entity21 's ability to persuade a mass - market audience to share with strangers , @entity20 's goals are n't without precedent -- largely thanks to a trail blazed by similar app @entity156			1
founded in 2006 by @entity159 entrepreneur @entity158 , @entity156 now connects 153 million people around the world			1
it is hugely successful in @entity163 and is currently pushing into the @entity164			0
though it has a reputation as a dating site -- some news reports have described it as like @entity12 , but for sex -- the motivation behind @entity156 's hook ups are numerous , according to @entity171 , the company 's newly appointed chief operating officer			1
" we 're solving a fundamental need of humans to connect and meet with other people , " @entity171 told @entity1 on the sidelines of @entity174			0
could mobile apps save local news ? whereas @entity21 focuses on specifically locating and identifying strangers in close proximity , @entity156 casts its net much wider , linking like - minded souls in nearby neighborhoods and leaving it up to them to set up a physical rendezvous			1
yet , said @entity171 , it recognizes that people are clearly willing to take a leap into the unknown			0
" as children , we have no problem meeting people , but as we grow up it becomes harder , " he said			0
" the social friction increases			0
what we do is help reduce that friction			0
" @entity156 makes money as a " freemium " service			1
there is no charge to join , but users can pay to promote themselves across the network in the same way that retailers optimize their position in @entity207 searches			2
@entity171 said further revenues could soon come from advertisements			0
@entity156 has already achieved the critical mass needed to make it a going concern and seems to have no problem persuading users to share personal details -- a fact that should be encouraging to highlight and other , newer social startups			1
like any dating or social site , however , it must combat users who post false identities			2
mobile devices offer ' seductive ' fantasy " the key thing in gaining trust is user choice			2
users only share the information they want to share , " @entity171 said			2
" as with every open platform , it is open to abuse			0
we have the ability for our community members to flag abuse , and we have 250 moderators			0
we allow users to authenticate their profiles , via @entity12 or @entity239 or their mobile phones			1
" and , said @entity171 , he is confident the space will grow as society opens up to the possibilities of sharing with strangers			2
" teens growing up now are more comfortable with the online world , and so the cultural mores are beginning to change over time , and that makes us optimistic , " he said			2
" this model of interaction is going to be much more prevalent in the future			0

mobile apps connecting strangers in real world might be " the next @entity12 "
highlight connects mobile users within 150 meters based upon mutual friends or interests
@entity156 operates on same *principle* but covers more distance
some worry that @entity267 - aided introductions will seem creepy
