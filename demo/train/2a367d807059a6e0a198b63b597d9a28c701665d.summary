@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's rappers have long made a point of speaking their minds , their lyrics often bringing them into conflict with the old regime			1
but more than simply upsetting the status quo , according to one of the country 's leading rappers their music was the " fuel " for @entity1 's revolution			1
" @entity22 " is @entity1 's best - known rapper and one of the founding fathers of hip - hop music in the country			1
his most popular videos have reached 350,000 hits on @entity25 and he 's performed to audiences of over 50,000 , sharing the stage with such @entity29 rap idols as @entity30			2
his latest recording is " @entity33 @entity32 and the 40 thieves , " a barbed account of the former president deceiving his people			1
rappers risked the wrath of the authorities under the @entity32 regime , writing and recording in secret studios			1
@entity22 says he was arrested and briefly jailed in 2005 for a song which was n't one of his			1
in recent years @entity1 rappers have taken advantage of social networks to post music videos on the internet			1
most notably , a rap by 21 - year - old @entity52 -- known as " @entity52 " -- went viral after he was arrested by armed police at his home in the eastern coastal town of @entity56 and taken to @entity0 for interrogation			2
the song " mr president your people are @entity62 " was a personal message to president @entity32 outlining the corruption and deprivations besetting the @entity1 people			1
eight days later " @entity52 " had been released and @entity32 had fled the country			2
inside the @entity68 traveled to a recording studio in the suburbs of @entity0 where @entity22 makes his music to get his take on the role of rap in @entity1 's revolution			1
@entity77 : how difficult was it to make music before the revolution and how has that changed now ? @entity22 : rap and hip - hop in @entity1 before the january 14th revolution was very difficult			1
it was forbidden by the old regime and some people were jailed			0
rappers such as @entity88 , @entity89 and myself stood up to those difficulties and made our voice heard			2
hip - hop music has contributed greatly to the revolution in @entity1			1
the revolution started on the internet			2
thank you to @entity99 and guys like @entity52 and @entity101 -- they spoke before and after january 14th and contributed to break the fear barrier among youngsters			0
the revolution is a social movement and rap is always talking about social issues			0
we come from very tough neighborhoods and we talk in our songs about social problems such as unemployment			0
we feel like our voices did n't get to the regime , to the top officials , but thank @entity116 our voices were heard by the people , so we were the fuel of our revolution			0
@entity77 : do you expect hip - hop to explode in @entity1 now you have more freedom ? @entity22 : yes , i welcome the new generation of rappers			1
everybody has their own style and we will compete , but i am very glad that we will have a new rap scene			0
i think that rap music and hip - hop has a good future in @entity1			2
along with @entity101 and @entity52 there are many other rappers who did n't get their opportunity before the revolution and now is the time to have their chance			2
@entity77 : what are your thoughts about what 's happened in other parts of the region since the revolution in @entity1 ? @entity22 : i 'm so happy to see other @entity149 countries looking to get back their freedom , and not just because i 'm a @entity1 , but because @entity1 played a leading role in this matter			1
my message to them is to do things in a peaceful way			0
yes , you can ask for your freedom and a job , but you can do it in a peaceful way			0
you can also ask for regime change -- it 's the people 's basic right to remove it			0
i want to emphasize , do it in a peaceful way			0
do n't let a lot of people die and lose your wealth by destroying your economy			0
@entity77 : how do you see the future for @entity1 ? @entity22 : this revolution has been made by the youth of @entity1			1
they are the ones who stood up against the old regime and asked for their freedom of speech			0
the whole nation is happy about the revolution but after every revolution there are some economic and political problems such as unemployment , but we should stick together to make this happen			0
the stone which brought down the government we can use to rebuild the country .			0
