-- from a stock market perspective , the month of june was one of the nastiest on record for the @entity4			1
it lost 22 % from beginning to end , putting this small exchange with high volatility into bear market territory			1
this is a bad start for its first official month of trading as an emerging market after a reclassification by @entity14			2
@entity15 's @entity4 broke through the 5,000 level in april , but the intense selling took the index down to below 4,000 on monday , before investors spotted another buying opportunity			1
on tuesday , the index was down 5 % , then finished the day up 3 %			0
it seems a " casino - like culture " has set in			1
as @entity24 , head of equities at @entity26 said , " the fundamentals just do n't make sense			0
" after peaking at 19 times 2014 earnings , the june correction took it down to more reasonable levels of 13 times earnings			0
but after the market wash - out in june , the @entity4 is still up 82 % in the past 12 months of trading			1
the real danger , fund managers suggest , is that relatively new investors have borrowed to buy property stocks			1
once the selling started they sold their holdings having to cover their loans			0
one property stock in particular triggered this market madness			2
@entity45 is a large construction group which has business scattered all over the @entity47 and @entity48			0
its former ceo @entity49 was forced to resign last month after it was found that he stockpiled 28 % of the company 's shares , most of them in the span of a month			2
he is now offering to sell his stake for double what the stock is currently trading and go on his merry way			0
fund managers and markets strategists tell me trading activity around @entity45 screams out for market reform and greater transparency -- something the @entity14 listed as a requirement before the @entity69 and @entity70 markets were assigned an upgrade to the emerging market club			0
but the june sell - off is bringing @entity15 's red - hot property market back into focus			1
residential real estate values climbed 33 % year - on - year in the first quarter of the year and are nearly back at levels seen in 2008 before the property bubble burst the next year			1
hotel occupancy rates hit 88 % in the same timeframe according to property consultancy @entity82			2
@entity24 of @entity84 told me he hopes this market matures enough to strip out the volatility and identify the underlying fundamentals -- chief among them is solid economic growth			0
the @entity69 is expected to expand by some 5 % this year , as a result of @entity15 securing the @entity91 in 2020 and intense infrastructure spending in neighboring @entity93 , which controls most of the oil wealth in the federation			1
on a recent visit to the @entity15 trading floor , retired school teacher turned private trader @entity99 did a simple calculation , telling me the @entity102 index was trading above 16,500 and @entity15 below 5,000			2
" we are looking for more inshallah , " he said meaning if @entity103 is willing			0
his prayers , so far , have not been answered			0
more from @entity107 : @entity109 's ' new reality ' shakes global oil markets			1

@entity107 looks at @entity4 's new " casino - like culture "
in june , @entity15 's stocks lost 22 % from beginning to end and moved into bear market territory
the *aggressive* sell - off is bringing @entity15 's red - hot property market back into focus
