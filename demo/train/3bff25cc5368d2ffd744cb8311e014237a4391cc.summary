-- in december , the @entity2 @entity1 intervened under the @entity3 to stay a @entity5 voter id law			1
controversy rages over similar laws in @entity8 and @entity9			2
many expect @entity1 action against the @entity9 law			1
( the @entity8 law was approved in 2005 by the @entity15 administration @entity1			1
) the argument against voter id goes as follows : the most common form of @entity17 in the @entity2 is a driver 's license			1
nonwhite registered voters are somewhat less likely than whites to have driver 's licenses			1
in @entity5 , for example , the gap is nearly 20 %			1
therefore , voter @entity17 will have a discriminatory effect			1
but then we 're left with a question : what happens when those minority @entity31 need social services ? how do they identify themselves then ? then , of course , they rely on a social security number			1
but @entity40 numbers are notoriously prone to theft , fraud and tampering			0
the @entity44 counted more than 400,000 cases of theft of @entity40 numbers in the 18 months from mid- 2009 to the end of 2011			0
surely that is only the tip of the iceberg			0
you do n't sustain a population of 10 million to 12 million illegal aliens without lots and lots of fake @entity40 numbers			0
in other words , the @entity2 has created two forms of de facto id : one ( @entity40 ) that is universal , but not reliable ; another ( state - issued driver 's licenses ) that is reliable , but not universal			1
obvious question : why ca n't we have a system of personal identification that is universal and reliable ? modern technology enables the design of just such a card while also protecting and even enhancing personal privacy			1
imagine you are a 22 year old who wants to buy a case of beer			0
( or a 66 year old who wants to buy a discount movie ticket			0
) you present your driver 's license that shows on its face your date of birth , and the cashier computes whether you qualify			1
but that card actually discloses more information than the cashier requires			2
the cashier is asking a " yes " or " no " question : 21 or older ? 65 or older ? or imagine that you are an employer who wants to check a job applicant 's eligibility for work			2
again , the card the employer will see presents more information than required			2
the employer does n't care whether you are a citizen or a permanent resident or where you were born or when you became a resident alien			0
he just wants a " yes " or " no " to the question : eligible to work ? same thing at the polls			0
the poll watchers do n't need to know whether today is your birthday			0
they do n't need to know your height or weight			0
they just need to know : are you who you say you are ? and are you eligible to cast a ballot ? on its face , it would carry only your name and image			0
that 's all most people need most of the time to confirm your identity ; for example , when checking the name on your airline ticket against the person bearing the ticket			1
but none of the other information that now appears on your driver 's license needs to appear there			1
not the date of birth			0
no the height or weight			0
information beyond face and name would be encrypted inside the card and would be divulged only to specific scanners			2
liquor store owners would have machines that could read only the answer to the " 21 or older ? " question			0
employers would have machines that could read only the " eligible to work ? " question			0
voting places would read only " eligible to vote ? " @entity148 in each of the states could encrypt motorist information onto the card			1
if you moved to another state , you would not need a new card			2
a visit to the @entity148 in the new state would wipe out the obsolete motorist information and substitute the new			0
police might have more sophisticated scanners that could read more exactly your address or date of birth or citizenship status			0
the card would have encrypted information useful to prevent social service fraud ; for example , the number of children you have so you ca n't enroll for more benefits than for which you qualify			2
the card might also carry encrypted medical information useful in case of emergency such as blood type and allergies to medicines			2
none of this information would be visible to the casual observer			0
none would be available except to those with a right and need to access it			0
the card need not be compulsory			2
even in @entity190 , supposedly the homeland of @entity189 statism , the national id card is noncompulsory			1
but the card would add so much convenience to life that most people would want it : one ultrasecure document that smoothed your way through the modern world -- and guaranteed no - questions asked about your rights to vote , work , drive and purchase alcohol			1
such a card , available for free to all , should obviate all objections to the seemingly commonsense requirement that we not just " take your word for it " when you vote or apply for social benefits			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1

the @entity1 is seeking to stop a @entity5 voter id law
@entity217 says that minorities are much less likely to have most common @entity17 , a driver 's license
he says a new national identity card would enable voting , other government services
@entity229 : the card would be free and would be a convenience that people would value
