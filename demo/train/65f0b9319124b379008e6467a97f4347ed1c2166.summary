@entity0 -- @entity0 's @entity3 is charging gov. @entity4 with an ethics violation for accepting free tickets to the first game of last year 's @entity8 , the commission said wednesday			1
@entity4 violated the state 's restriction on gifts for public officials in october when he sought free tickets to the game in @entity15 between the @entity16 and the @entity17 , the commission said			1
the commission also said @entity4 lied under oath about intending to pay for the tickets			1
the governor 's office said it was reviewing the commission 's findings			1
" governor @entity4 maintains his innocence and intends to challenge the findings of the commission both with respect to the law and the facts , " the office said			1
" the governor takes this matter very seriously and intends to fully cooperate with any further inquiries or investigations , but believes the commission has acted unfairly in this matter			1
" the governor could face an $ 80,000 fine for violating the state 's gift ban for public officials and up to $ 10,000 if he is found to have used his official position to secure unwarranted privileges			1
the commission has asked @entity0 attorney general @entity46 and the @entity48 district attorney to investigate whether @entity4 or " anyone else " committed a crime during the governor 's interview with the commission and by causing a check to be back - dated			1
@entity4 , who announced last week that he would not run for election to a full term , has faced controversy since news reports charged that his aide was involved in a domestic violence incident with a woman and that state police later allegedly pressured her to keep quiet			0
the aide , @entity63 , has been suspended without pay			0
@entity4 has asked @entity46 , a possible contender for the governor 's office , to investigate the matter			2
@entity63 was among the four guests who attended the october 28 game with @entity4 , the @entity3 said			0
he also was involved in obtaining the tickets , which cost $ 425 a piece , from the @entity16 , the commission said in its notice of reasonable cause			2
according to the commission , the governor testified that he decided he should attend @entity76 of the @entity8 and directed @entity63 to get tickets from the @entity16			1
the governor told his aide that the request should include tickets for his son , @entity82 , and his son 's friend			2
@entity63 then told the governor 's scheduler , @entity85 , to contact the @entity16 about five or six tickets			2
@entity63 said @entity4 would be attending in a " ceremonial capacity			0
" based on @entity63 's representation , the commission said , " the @entity16 did not expect payment for any tickets because the tickets were for official business			2
" they had requested a letter from the governor 's counsel confirming that , and the counsel had sent a letter saying so , the commission said			2
the @entity16 said they require such confirmation or payment when public officials request tickets , the commission said			2
however , the commission said , the governor did not participate in opening ceremonies for the game and was not announced to the crowd			0
he also did not meet with first lady @entity113 and vice president @entity115 's wife , @entity114 , who attended the game , or members of the @entity16 organization , the commission said			0
in testimony , the governor said he always intended to pay for the tickets for his son and his son 's friend			1
he said he had taken a check to the game for the tickets , filling out the date and the $ 850 but leaving the payee section blank			0
" while he had no opportunity to pay while at the stadium , the governor testified that he gave the check to @entity63 and asked him to send the check to the @entity16 , " the commission said			1
however , the commission said that it had compared the handwriting on the check with that of the governor 's handwriting on other documents and that the governor did not write the check sent to the @entity16			0
" the handwriting on the check that @entity63 forwarded to the @entity16 as payment for his ticket to @entity150 reveals that the same person who wrote and signed the governor 's check also wrote and signed @entity63 's check , " the commission said			0
the check paterson said he wrote is dated october 27 , the day before @entity158 , the commission said , although the governor said he had written the check on the day of the game			0
in its notice of of reasonable cause , the commission also cited testimony from the governor 's communications director , @entity166 , whom a @entity169 reporter had asked about payment for the tickets			1
@entity166 said that he had discussed the game several times with @entity4 and @entity63 and that the governor indicated to him that @entity16 president @entity176 , a law school classmate of @entity4 's , had invited @entity4 to the game , the commission said			0
" during this conversation , the governor said nothing to @entity166 about his intention to pay for the tickets for his son or his son 's friend , nor did the governor mention anything about having previously written a check for $ 850 and giving it to @entity63 as payment to the @entity16 , " the commission said			1
the reporter later told @entity166 that the @entity16 disputed @entity4 's account , saying @entity176 had never invited the governor to the game , the commission said			0
@entity166 confronted the governor , who " then conceded to @entity166 that @entity176 had not explicitly invited him to @entity158 , " the commission said			0
the commission also said the governor and his son attended last year 's @entity200 at @entity15 and at @entity201 , where the @entity202 play			0
" the governor testified that he did not pay for his ticket or his son 's ticket " for either event , the commission said .			1
