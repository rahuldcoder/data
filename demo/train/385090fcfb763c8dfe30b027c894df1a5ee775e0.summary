-- the @entity2 people should sue @entity4 's chattering class for whiplash			1
just a few days ago , when @entity7 was selected by @entity8 to be his running mate , there was a burst of media euphoria			1
the nomination was a game changer			1
@entity7 was an ideas guy			1
he would elevate what to date had been a lackluster campaign			0
he had killer abs. but within 48 hours , the so - called " narrative " had changed			0
the narrative is not actual facts			0
it is how those facts look after they 've been run through the political spin cycle			0
thanks to modern technology , the whole process of spinning narratives that once took weeks , now happens in the blinking of an eye			0
@entity29 , in its manic frenzy , hopped up on bite - size bits of emotion - filled social interaction , condenses months into hours , news cycles into moments , but without any of the perspective that time or thought brings			0
within a few ticks of the clock of @entity7 bounding down the gangplank of the @entity41 , he went from " it boy " to calamity			1
comments about his hair and his missing necktie were so rapidly and extensively commented upon that they had become @entity49 © s before they could be written about in the next morning 's paper			2
saturday , he was a bold stroke			0
by tuesday , @entity7 was a potential liability			1
old people were sure to hate him			0
and once an @entity2 that 's a bit on the chubby side took note of his 6 % body fat , he would be a goner			2
@entity59 against the machine what had promised to be the beginning of a long overdue debate about " big ideas " was now seen , often by the same commentators who were upbeat days earlier , as a trigger for more hopelessly divisive bickering			2
meanwhile , seemingly cooler heads sniffed that this was n't much of a story in the first place			0
after all , this was all about a vice presidential nomination			0
@entity75 's quip about the vice presidency not being worth " a bucket of warm spit " was dusted off as it is every four years , this time with a little more seeming relevance since @entity75 was , back in 1932 , the last sitting @entity80 member to " ascend " to veepdom			2
@entity82 , writing for the @entity81 , suggested it was likely the pick did n't " much matter at all , " asserting " that 's usually what happens with vice presidential picks			1
" so , let 's take a step back now that we have the @entity93 perspective half a week offers			2
does the pick matter ? could it ? how ? first , the conventional wisdom that vice presidential picks do n't matter is just wrong			1
for more than half a century , vice presidents and vice presidential nominees have had a huge impact			0
@entity102 's vice president , @entity101 , became president			1
@entity105 's vice president , @entity104 , became president			1
one of @entity101 's vice presidents , @entity107 , was at the center of a scandal			2
his next one , @entity110 , became president			2
@entity111 elevated the vice presidency into a real position of policy - partnership , giving @entity115 an unprecedented role , which led him to be the @entity118 presidential nominee in 1984			0
@entity120 's vice president , @entity119 , became president			1
@entity122 's vice president , @entity121 , was a true policy partner , won the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election and later picked up a @entity125			1
@entity127 's vice president , @entity126 , was the most powerful vice president in history			1
@entity129 is both a policy partner and , as his " back in chains " gaffe showed , he is still a headline grabber			0
and even losing nominees for the office , from @entity136 to @entity137 to @entity138 to @entity139 and @entity140 , have had a lasting impact			0
@entity142 : will @entity8 take the @entity2 to war ? thus , even if @entity7 were not one of the leaders of perhaps the single most influential new political movement in @entity2 in the past decade , the @entity146 - aligned deficit hawks of " the @entity147 , " he , as a vice presidential pick , would immediately vault to the forefront of @entity2 politics			1
already his budget plan is one of the defining documents of that movement , and thrust him to the forefront of it			0
naturally , this makes him a lightning rod for criticism from @entity118 -- even though in the past , @entity118 budget experts such as @entity163 and @entity164 praised his command of the numbers -- but could also be the trigger for a debate that @entity118 , if they believe in their principles , should welcome			1
demagoguery is the temptation for both camps and seems preferred by most of their hired guns and super pac supporters			0
but they do n't have to rule the day			0
a top @entity118 donor friend of mine , former @entity180 chief executive @entity178 , sees an alternative approach			0
" i see an opportunity , " he told me , " for the two candidates to present their adversarial cases as best they know how on the basis of principles rather than irrelevancies like how many years of tax disclosure has been made			0
" he went on to add , " let 's view this selection of @entity7 as the beginning of the development of a true @entity196 national viewpoint and let 's view it as a challenge to president @entity200 to stop going after @entity8 personally and to speak to the core issues			1
both sides have to have the courage to own their ideas , defend them and make the case for the sacrifices any serious approach will entail			0
this could help elevate that and the debate and give the @entity2 people the kind of true choice they deserve right now			1
" ' encouragingly , this is a view echoed in the comments of thought leaders in the @entity196 such as commentators @entity218 , @entity220 or @entity221			0
that 's significant because as important as the vice presidential pick actually is , the greater vices with which we must contend in contemporary politics are the tendency to demonize our opponents and to chase after the rapidly moving but ephemeral targets set by the social - networking shouting match			2
@entity7 's @entity231 sensibilities an asset this is not just dangerous because it 's vapid , alienates voters and sheds no light on anything			1
it 's dangerous because sometimes in their zeal for the spotlight or their love of scorched earth politics , candidates , campaign advisers and partisan commentators forget that both sides in this contest are us			2
in the end , as appealing as substantive debate is , it 's not enough			1
because debate that is not followed by the cooperation required for action is wasted			1
that is why we must hope that both sides see the possibilities for turning this vice presidential pick , like him or not , into a catalyst for the change in the character of our politics that our times require			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			2

@entity270 : *pundits* whipsaw on @entity7 -- first he 's game changer , then liability
he says *vp* picks matter ; historically *vp*s influential , sometimes become president
he says @entity7 pick could spur needed debate , *clarify* choice in election
@entity270 : substantive debate great but must be followed by cooperation on action
