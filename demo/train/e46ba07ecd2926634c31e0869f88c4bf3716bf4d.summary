-- it took years to get through -- an increase in the fee airline passengers pay for airport screening and other government - run aspects of aviation security			1
it takes effect this summer but now already president @entity10 wants those who travel by air to pick up even more of the security tab			1
for more than a decade , the so - called 9/11 fee has been $ 2.50 for a one - way ticket -- or $ 5 with one or more connections			0
on a typical round - trip flight with connections , the maximum was $ 10			2
under a bipartisan budget deal signed into law by @entity10 in january , passengers will pay $ 5.60 one - way , regardless of connections , beginning july 1			2
that brings a round - trip fee to $ 11.20			1
now @entity10 is proposing to raise the fee to $ 6 for a one - way trip , or $ 12 for the typical round trip			1
the increase , the administration says , will make the fees " more closely reflect the costs of passenger screening and other aviation security services			2
" the security fee currently brings in about $ 1.7 billion a year in revenue			2
by law , the first $ 250 million is set aside for a fund that provides airport facility modifications and certain security equipment , according to the @entity41			0
the remaining amount goes to the @entity43 , but covers only about 30 percent of the agency 's aviation - related security costs			0
under the current budget plan , the higher fee will raise that number to about 43 percent of the total cost			0
it is unclear what percentage of the total cost will be covered if the $ 6 fee becomes standard			0
but it 's also unclear what parts of @entity10 's budget proposals will be adopted , if any			0
the @entity57 and @entity10 administrations sought for years to raise the fee without success , making the request a staple of annual budget proposals			0
they were resisted by key lawmakers and the airlines , who consider aviation security a national security priority that government should cover			1
but @entity70 slowly warmed to the idea of a fee increase as a way to cut government spending in an era of fiscal austerity .			1

first increase in aviation security fee in years takes effect in july
but president @entity10 wants it to go higher , to $ 6 per one - way trip
airlines have long resisted fee hikes , saying security should be government *responsibility*
@entity91 gave in to increase as a way to reduce government spending
