-- @entity1 kicks off in @entity2 on september 22			1
but @entity2 is across an ocean — and ocean - crossing plane tickets are expensive , as are hotels and transportation and schnitzel			0
fortunately , there are beer festivals across the @entity11 running parallel to the fest 's official september 22 - october 7 schedule			1
look out for the smaller festivals if you want a more intimate experience , advises @entity18 , publisher of @entity19			1
if you 're after new flavors , keep an eye out for fests that stock rare brews			1
if you prefer a party , the biggest festivals emphasize atmosphere , scheduling bands and food vendors , in addition to breweries			1
your biggest problems , suggests @entity18 , will be picking one beer festival , because there are so many			1
here are five festivals to choose from so @entity1 need not go uncelebrated			1
they are big and small , stretching from the @entity39 onward			1
they include tastings , trainings and at least one bratwurst eating contest , in @entity44 , @entity45			0
no doubt there 's a festival near you , so mark your calendars and raise your glasses			0
@entity51 ( september 22 , @entity52 , @entity53 , $ 40 - $ 85 ; october 6 , @entity54 , @entity55 , $ 40 - $ 45 ) founded 17 years ago , the @entity51 is a multi-city , multi-date affair , presented by @entity58			0
its flagship is still @entity54 , where festival organizers expect to have as many as 250 beers this year , up from 170 last year			1
but the @entity52 fest is new , and it 's the first time the event has been held outside the @entity66			0
it 's a reflection of the " massively growing craft beer market " in the @entity69 , said all about beer beer and brewery manager @entity71			1
photos : @entity1 2012 with its slate of events and materials , including tastings and an online " @entity80 " guide , the festival and magazine are committed to " spreading the word about craft beer , " @entity71 said			1
that means showing off the best beverages and helping people learn how to drink them			0
@entity87 ( september 21 - 29 , @entity44 , @entity45 , tickets range by day and event ; prices range from free to $ 75 ) @entity44 's @entity87 , backed by @entity90 , is n't a celebration of @entity1 exactly , but it 's full of celebratory @entity1 events , including eating contests and the release of a slate of fall beers			1
@entity98 , hosted by the @entity100 location of the @entity101 , is the week 's kick - off and there are dozens more events that follow			1
the festival hopes to keep widening : this year , it 's partnering with the @entity109 ( @entity109 , for short ) , the city 's alternative weekly , to publish an event guide			1
the expectation is " people that did n't even know [ it ] existed will find out about it , " said @entity111 , the founder of @entity90			0
beer festivals around town used to draw 100 people			1
now they draw thousands , said @entity120			0
@entity101 brewery used to reach out to crowds			0
now it has to turn them away			0
@entity125 ( october 6 , @entity126 , @entity127 , $ 20 - $ 77 ) the self - described " largest annual celebration of @entity127 craft beer , " the @entity125 , which benefits @entity128 that serve at - risk kids , has been around since 2003			2
held in historic @entity133 in @entity126 , the festival will feature nearly 30 @entity127 breweries — from @entity135 to @entity136 — and more than 100 beers			2
beer and chocolate and beer and cheese pairing sessions are scheduled			2
@entity142 on @entity143 ( september 29 , @entity142 , @entity144 , $ 1 - $ 100 ) last year , @entity142 on @entity143 exploded			2
supporting the @entity145 , @entity142 on @entity143 is a co-production with the @entity147 , a local bar			0
it was the @entity147 's founder who first brought up the idea of doing a fundraiser - festival , said @entity153 , events coordinator for the @entity154			2
when autumn leaves fall that was three years ago			0
last year , 7,000 people attended @entity142 on tap and it raised $ 100,000			2
organizers expect more this year , @entity160 said			2
it 's " huge for such a young event to explode like that , " she said , " but i think we hit the right chord with young @entity168 that like drinking and that like being outside			0
" @entity170 ( september 22 , @entity171 , @entity172 , $ 10 - $ 25 ) @entity171 is the home of the two - year - old @entity170 , and it 's also home to @entity173 , @entity11 's oldest brewing company			2
one led to the other			0
" basically what we 're doing is celebrating the traditional brewing of @entity183 beer in the home of @entity11 's oldest brewery , " said @entity175 , communications coordinator for the @entity176 and one of the festival organizers			2
it 's a small group behind the scenes , but support from both the community and @entity173 , which encouraged the festival to seek out microbreweries across @entity172 , has been strong			1
the second time around , the @entity170 has quadrupled the number of home brew applicants it has and expanded its programming slate as well : there will be beers to taste and beers to buy and , @entity175 said , a band that specializes in @entity201 music			0
one more to consider : if you¹re already thirsty for next year , put the @entity203 in @entity204 on your list			0
this year¹s october event is sold out , but @entity18 calls it " the best 40 bucks you could spend on beer			0
" put on by the @entity210 , a national trade organization supporting craft beer , the festival has been going on since 1982			0
it brings thousands of people from across the country and spans three days with more than 2,000 beers to taste			1
