@entity0 -- in a move that could improve security and keep airport lines moving , the @entity2 early next year will begin testing machines that match a traveler 's boarding pass with his or her government - issued @entity9 , while verifying that both documents are authentic			1
the machines will assist the @entity2 " travel document checkers , " who now conduct checks assisted only by ultraviolet flashlights and magnifying loupes			0
in 2006 , an @entity20 doctoral student created a website allowing people to create fake boarding passes to demonstrate how a known terrorist on the " @entity26 " list could use a fake boarding pass to get past a checkpoint			1
once on the other side , the terrorist could use a real boarding pass acquired under an alias to board a plane			1
and in june , a @entity34 man was arrested after he flew across the country allegedly with a false boarding pass			2
authorities said they found several other phony boarding passes in his luggage			0
the new technology would authenticate government - issued ids by comparing written information on the card with information encoded in the @entity9 's bar codes , magnetic strip or computer chip			0
it would also match the id to the boarding pass			1
the system will alert screeners if either document does not pass validation			0
if the issue is easily rectifiable , such as misspelling of the passenger 's name , the @entity2 may allow the person to proceed			1
if not immediately resolved , the passenger will be directed to a @entity2 supervisor			0
" this technology will help facilitate risk - based security , while making the process more effective and efficient , " @entity2 administrator @entity61 said			0
the @entity2 has awarded contracts of $ 79 million each to three companies : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity70 each company will provide 10 machines for testing at @entity74 airports			2
the @entity2 has not disclosed which airports will get the machines			1
in august , the @entity2 's chief privacy officer issued a report saying the machines have minimal privacy implications because only a limited amount of personal information is collected by the machines and because this information " is deleted after use			2
" a @entity2 spokeswoman said earlier versions of the technology were tested at two @entity0 - area airports in 2009 .			0

the @entity2 will test machines that match a boarding pass with the passenger 's id
the @entity2 has not disclosed which airport will get the test machines
the machines will be tested starting early in 2012
the machines could improve security and *traffic* flow in airports
