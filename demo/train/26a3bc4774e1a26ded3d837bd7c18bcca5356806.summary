@entity0 -- a legal group filed a @entity4 lawsuit on monday asking that videotapes showing the interrogation of a terror detainee at @entity8 , @entity9 , be made public			1
the suit filed in the @entity14 is focused on interrogation techniques used on @entity16 , a man @entity12 authorities have said was intended to be the 20th hijacker in the 9/11 terror attacks			1
" from 2002 through 2003 , mr. @entity16 was the victim of a deliberate and calculated interrogation strategy involving the repeated use of torture and other profoundly cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment , " according to the lawsuit filed by the @entity24			1
the lawsuit says @entity16 was subjected to severe sleep deprivation , isolation , 20 - hour interrogations , severe temperatures and forced nudity			1
the suit says @entity16 also experienced " religious , sexual , and moral humiliation " including instances in which female interrogators straddled him			2

representatives for those agencies declined to comment			0
during a conference call with reporters , the center said lawyers involved with the case had seen some videotapes of @entity16 as the result of a 2009 federal court ruling , but they were not allowed to discuss them publicly			1
" i found them extremely disturbing , sickening even , " said @entity51 , a human rights lawyer at @entity52			0
@entity59 's treatment " has been the subject of public debate and congressional inquiries , as well as internal agency investigations , " according to the lawsuit			1
" the @entity12 public should now be permitted to see what occurred for itself			1
" @entity51 described @entity16 as a " broken man " who may never recover from the psychological and physical effects of the interrogation techniques allegedly used on him			2
in a 2009 interview with the @entity75 , the @entity36 official in charge of deciding whether @entity8 detainees would go to trial said she concluded the @entity16 case could not proceed because of all the interrogation techniques used on him			0
" his treatment met the legal definition of torture , " @entity78 , then head of the convening authority of military commissions , told the @entity75			0
" the techniques they used were all authorized , but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent			0
" @entity89 has since left that @entity36 post			0
@entity59 , a citizen of @entity91 , tried to enter the @entity12 at @entity92 , @entity93 , on august 4 , 2001 , a little more than a month before the september 11 attacks			2
