@entity1 's interior minister said monday that based on intelligence analysis , " a strong presumption exists " that a @entity1 citizen named @entity5 participated in the " despicable crimes " shown on the latest video from @entity8			1
the video released over the weekend depicts the slayings of several men described by @entity8 as @entity13 soldiers and appears to show the aftermath of the beheading of @entity17 aid worker @entity16			1
while @entity5 's involvement is only alleged and investigations continue , interior minister @entity18 said intelligence analysis of the video suggests " a very high probability that a @entity1 citizen has directly participated in the execution of these despicable crimes			1
" public prosecutor @entity27 said authorities are investigating the possibility that a second @entity1 citizen may have been involved in the killings shown on the video			1
@entity5 , 22 , went to @entity13 in 2013 after visiting @entity33 the previous year , @entity18 said			1
according to @entity27 , @entity5 is a " self - radicalized " jihadist who traveled to @entity13 under the guise of a humanitarian mission			1
he was known to @entity1 security services as far back as 2011 , the prosecutor said			2
in july , @entity5 spoke to @entity1 broadcaster @entity38 , describing life as a fighter			1
" everything is paid for			0
weapons are not ours , we do n't pay for them			0
same for the missions , the guns , " he said , according to a @entity49 translation of his remarks			0
" the other day i wanted to buy shampoo			0
i wrote it down on the list -- we have a list where we write down stuff			0
then the boss goes out shopping at the market			0
and he brings us back the shampoo , for example , without making us pay			0
" " the goal as a group , the goal as a community is to establish the laws of @entity67 on @entity68 , " he said			0
" but from a personal point of view , it is martyrdom			0
" the video in which @entity5 is said to have appeared is widely considered the most brutal yet released by the terror group , which is also known by the acroynm @entity8 as well as its self - given name , the @entity75			1
@entity17 president @entity77 , in confirming @entity16 's beheading , called the executions " pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity			0
" more barbaric @entity8 videos expected after @entity16 's death , analyst says the 16 - minute production includes a lengthy segment on the group 's history and shows in graphic detail beheadings of several men described as @entity13 military pilots			1
several men without masks , presumably @entity8 fighters , are shown in that segment killing the men			2
the video does n't show @entity16 's death but does show a masked man dressed in black , speaking in what sounds like a @entity101 accent			2
a similar figure appeared in earlier videos depicting the apparent beheadings of @entity105			0
@entity16 is the fifth @entity105 hostage to be killed by @entity8 since the @entity17 and its allies began airstrikes against @entity8 in august			2
@entity8 is believed to be holding at least two more @entity105 hostages : a 26 - year - old female , @entity17 aid worker , and @entity112 , a @entity114 journalist , who has appeared in a number of @entity8 - produced videos			1
@entity17 officials have credited the air campaign with stopping a wildly successful @entity8 ground offensive and disrupting the group 's ability to finance and plan its exploits			2
on monday , the @entity17 military said coalition warplanes conducted 31 airstrikes against @entity8 targets in @entity13 and @entity127 between friday and monday , hitting fighting positions , staging areas and units in the field , among other targets			1
opinion : @entity16 's murder a sign of weakness from a terror group on the run			0

@entity5 traveled to @entity13 in 2013 , interior minister @entity18 says
@entity5 's involvement only alleged but " high probability " it was him , @entity18 says
