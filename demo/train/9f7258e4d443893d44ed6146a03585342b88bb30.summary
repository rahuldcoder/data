i leave as president of a dignified nation , or i leave as a cadaver , ' " he said , his voice hoarse from shouting into a microphone " of course , the law will not be revoked , " he added , stabbing his finger into the air			0
speaking to a jubilant crowd outside the presidential palace , @entity8 said former president @entity138 and other political opponents were behind the day 's unrest -- which he repeatedly called an attempted coup			1

@entity8 thanked his supporters -- in particular his bodyguards -- for standing behind him and said the rebel police effort to oust him had failed			1
