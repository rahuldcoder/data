" asked why he rejected the @entity5 offer , @entity6 answered that " the @entity5 is an imperialist country , and i disagree with @entity5 policy towards @entity0 and the @entity36			1

" @entity0 officials in @entity10 and in the capital , @entity26 , have declined to comment on @entity6 ' case			1

neither placing him in pre-trial detention nor deporting him are appropriate solutions , " said the @entity97 - based group @entity95 in a statement			0
