-- a brutal @entity2 guerrilla group that terrorized @entity3 during the 1980s but pretty much disappeared when top leaders were captured in the 1990s is making a resurgence			1
police in @entity7 , @entity3 , carry coffins of officers killed in a november ambush by suspected @entity12 rebels			1
in the latest of several recent attacks by the @entity12 , known in @entity15 as the @entity12 , 14 government soldiers were killed in an ambush this month			1
it was , a @entity19 leader said afterward , " the strongest blow " against the government in quite a while			2
it also was not an isolated incident			2
" it 's like that horror movie , ' friday the 13th , ' " said @entity24 , president @entity25 's assistant secretary of state for inter-american affairs from 1989 to 1993			2
" you think you 've killed the beast , and the beast returns			0
" @entity19 declared war on the government in 1980 , carrying out bombings and assassinations that by official accounts killed more than 30,000 @entity3 during the next 20 years			1
another 30,000 @entity3 died at the hands of the government and paramilitary groups in the fight against the @entity19 , a government commission determined in 2003			1
in the countryside of central and southern @entity3 where the rebels were strongest , @entity19 waged an assassination campaign against government officials , the heads of state - owned farming collectives , business owners and even peasants who opposed the guerrillas			1
political rivals , including other marxists or leftists , were not immune either			0
@entity19 also conducted daring attacks in @entity7 , the capital			2
rebels blew up electrical transmission towers to cause citywide blackouts , bombed factories and set off explosives near government offices and inside the ruling party 's political headquarters			1
assassinations were carried out with seeming impunity on the streets of @entity7			0
" they terrorized @entity3 , " said @entity64 , a former @entity65 ambassador to @entity66 and the @entity68 's associate coordinator for counterterrorism from 1987 to 1989			1
in a sign of how desperate the situation had become , then - president @entity71 suspended the constitution in 1992			0
@entity3 officials now say @entity71 took the war against the @entity19 too far , and he was convicted this year of human rights abuses			1
a turning point came in september 1992 , when the government captured @entity19 leader @entity80 in a @entity7 apartment			2
authorities , who had been watching the apartment , found empty vials of psoriasis medicine in his garbage and knew they had found their man			0
@entity80 , a former university philosophy professor , was known to suffer from the skin ailment and had come into the city from his jungle hideout to seek treatment			0
the arrests of other top leaders in the 1990s seemed to ensure the demise of the group , which had split into two factions			1
@entity19 attacks continued sporadically , but the guerrillas seemed destined for the back pages of history , as their numbers and effectiveness diminished			1
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , @entity19 was believed to have about 5,000 guerrillas			1
by 2002 , analysts estimated that the group had about 200 members			1
but @entity19 , which always had worked closely with many of @entity3 's estimated 300,000 coca growers and drug traffickers , was far from dead			1
in the early part of this decade , the @entity68 and others warned of a possible resurgence			0
that warning appears to have come to fruition			0
perhaps most famously , @entity19 set off a bomb outside the @entity119 in @entity7 in march 2002 , a few days before president @entity117 was to visit			0
nine people died and 30 were injured			0
in a june 2003 attack on a jungle labor camp , rebels took about 70 workers hostage and demanded a large ransom			0
the workers were recovered safely , but there were conflicting reports on whether a ransom was paid			0
" i 've been watching them reappear now with a sense of dread ... like dying embers that have been brought back to life , " said retired four - star army gen. @entity130 , who was drug policy director for president @entity131			0
@entity137 , a senior fellow at the @entity138 and director of its @entity140 , said , " the left - wing terrorists are still alive and kicking			0
" @entity24 , the former assistant secretary of state , said he wonders whether @entity19 is as strong as it was 20 years ago			0
" it 's unclear whether this is just a localized version of @entity19 or a movement that has some legs , " he said			2
nonetheless , he added , the situation is " worrisome			0
" although @entity19 was never popular with @entity3 , @entity137 sees an ideological bent to the resurgence			1
" you can arrest someone , " he said			0
" you can kill someone			0
but you ca n't kill an idea			0
" and that idea , @entity137 , @entity24 and others say , has its roots in poor economic conditions and the lack of social justice			1
" the mission that @entity19 tried to communicate for a very long time is back there because circumstances changed			0
the circumstances are right for striking for social and economic reasons , " @entity137 said , adding , " i was surprised it did n't happen before			2
" @entity130 in large part blames the @entity3 government			1
" the problem is the country does n't work very well , " he said			0
" eighty - five percent of the people are living in rudimentary conditions			2
they look at their government and say			2
' there 's no justice here			1
' " @entity19 's renewed life , @entity130 said , " is a comment on the incompetence , the goofiness of the @entity3 government			1
" @entity24 sees a " resurgence of the left in @entity184 partly because of the economic crisis			2
" at the heart of @entity19 's power lies its alliance with @entity3 's drug trade , which often pays the guerrillas for security , intelligence and logistics			1
@entity195 guerrillas in @entity196 known as the @entity197 have struck a similar alliance with that country 's narcotraffickers			1
@entity130 calls it " a convergence between terrorism and crime			0
" the drug trade in @entity3 , he said , " produces a mountain of cash , and @entity19 will exploit that			1
" @entity24 reiterated a point that @entity65 officials have made before : the war on drugs can not be separated from the fight against terrorism			1
" it just shows why fighting drugs is n't just about fighting drugs , " @entity24 said			0
" it 's about combating forces of violence that are attacking democracy			2
" and he and others said the @entity19 has been allowed to get back in the game because the @entity65 was not paying much attention , distracted in part by the september 11 , 2001 , attacks and the wars in @entity228 and @entity229			1
" this shows why we have to continue to pay attention and be involved in @entity184 in a strong way , " @entity24 said			0
@entity137 said , " this is a forgotten continent from the point of view of @entity65 policy			2
it has fallen through the cracks			0

" they terrorized @entity3 , " *ex-* @entity65 envoy says of @entity12 guerrillas during 1980s
arrests of top rebel leaders in the 1990s seemed to ensure group 's demise
poor economic conditions , lack of justice fuel group 's *re-emergence* , analysts say
ambush this month kills 14 government soldiers in latest of recent attacks
