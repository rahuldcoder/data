more than 1,200 people have died as the deadliest ever outbreak of @entity2 takes hold in @entity3 , but despite information campaigns , fear is spreading even more quickly than the virus itself			1
this week some @entity2 patients in @entity9 ran away when the healthcare facility they were being treated at was attacked by rioters frightened of the disease			2
as medical staff and authorities battle to contain @entity2 , are rumors and superstition making the situation more difficult ? are myths making the @entity2 outbreak worse ? " absolutely , " says @entity21 's @entity20 , adding that the @entity9 clinic attack is just one sign of spiraling fear about the disease , which means that those who become sick are terrified of seeking help			1
the @entity28 says the " scale , duration , and lethality of the @entity2 outbreak have generated a high level of public anxiety " over the virus			1
" people worry that they will be ostracized by their community if they admit that they are ill or that their loved ones appear to have died of @entity2 , so they delay reporting the symptoms , and we 've heard anecdotes about secret burials , " @entity20 explains			1
a lack of understanding about what causes @entity2 and how it is passed on means the region is fertile ground for speculation and mistaken beliefs			2
and according to the @entity28 , the already difficult conditions are also being made tougher by public misunderstanding caused by " rumors on social media claiming that certain products or practices can prevent or cure ebola virus disease			1
" what sort of myths and rumors are involved ? the @entity28 reports that at least two people died in @entity60 as a result of drinking salt water , after stories circulated that doing so would protect against @entity2			1
other supposed " cures " for the disease include raw onions , coffee , condensed milk and holy water			0
while there are high hopes for experimental medicines and vaccines , the @entity28 points out there is , as yet , no known cure			0
" decades of scientific research have failed to find a curative or preventive agent of proven safety and effectiveness in humans , " it says			0
the organization has warned against paying heed to any old wives ' tales about potential treatments : " a lot of rumours on social media claiming certain products , practices can prevent or cure # @entity2			2
they are false , their use can be dangerous , " it tweeted tuesday			0
earlier this year , at the start of the outbreak , a team from @entity94 ( @entity94 ) , also known as @entity94 , had to stop working in one isolation ward in @entity98 because local residents mistakenly believed they had brought the virus with them			2
it 's a common misconception which makes the work of medical staff harder than it already is , @entity94 's dr. @entity101 told @entity21 : " [ when we decontaminate houses ] they think we are spreading the disease , so some villages just shut down their access , they put trees on the roads			1
" he says groups from @entity94 , the @entity113 and the @entity114 have also been pelted with rocks as they try to reach ebola - hit areas			0
@entity20 says the region 's recent history of bloody civil war also feeds the rumor - mill , with some claiming that the fact the army has been deployed to stop people dumping bodies in the streets is a sign the government is deliberately infecting people in order to have an excuse to enforce martial law			1
why are they proving so hard to dispel ? according to @entity20 widespread suspicion of authority , coupled with a lack of basic infrastructure mean that educating people about how to avoid infection is extremely difficult			1
" these are very remote places in countries still bearing the scars of war [ in @entity9 and @entity144 ] - people are already traumatized and there is a lot of distrust to be overcome : when the government says something , people do n't necessarily believe it , " she says			0
" there are n't enough doctors and healthcare workers - people just are n't used to seeing them in their communities , and so they are n't the figures of authority that they are elsewhere			0
" @entity20 said the practise of quarantining whole areas " almost like the plague villages of the @entity166 , " had also led to anger and mistrust as entire communities were cut off from vital supplies			2
" people say ' we 're going to die of hunger before we die of @entity2 ! ' " she said			2
the @entity171 says it is working to " provide food assistance to around one million people living in restricted access areas in the three affected countries " in an attempt to " stabilize affected communities by limiting unnecessary movement and enabling them to cope with lost livelihoods			1
" " emergency food aid is essential to enable people to follow strict quarantine rules , and to help people affected by the shock to recover socially and economically , " @entity181 , @entity182 's country director said in a statement on the @entity171 's website			1
" we are doing everything we can to continue delivering food to people in need in time			2
" what can be done to counter the problem ? those working to counteract the spread of @entity2 say better health education is needed , to raise awareness of the virus , explain how it is spread and what can be done about it			1
to do that , they desperately need more people on the ground in the remote regions of @entity3 which have been hardest hit by the disease			0
forget says the only way to be sure the information is getting through is to pass it on personally			0
" we need to go to the thousands of small villages and repeat the message on and on , because there are no radios , no tv there , " he explains			0
" it has to be one by one contact that needs to be done through the chiefs , the local authorities , the youth			0
it is time - consuming and very difficult			0
" " we have about 250 community health workers going village by village to give the right message to the population , " says @entity226 , @entity94 's emergency coordinator in @entity227 , @entity144			0
" because still we have unsafe burials , done without disinfection , still we have patients who are hiding themselves , still we have patients , or contacts of patients who are running away because they are afraid			0
" how do people react to @entity2 survivors ? @entity20 says those " lucky " enough to survive the disease frequently find that the stigma attached to @entity2 means they are ostracized once they recover			1
" they find it very difficult to come back to their communities and be accepted , because people just do n't believe that they have been cured , " she explains			0
" there 's a lot of superstition , a belief that @entity2 is almost a ' curse ' and that makes it much more difficult to deal with			2
