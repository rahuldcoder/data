@entity0 , @entity1 than cars			1
black players such as @entity10 typify the new multiracial @entity11			1
it is a typical , even iconic , white @entity1 scene			1
at first glance , off the field , it might appear that nothing has changed in @entity1 rugby -- the sport that came to symbolize white domination -- since the days of @entity20			1
most of the spectators are white , @entity23 and guzzling brandy and coke			2
on their " braais , " they are cooking the local favorite " boerewors " -- a distinctive local farmer 's sausage			1
but appearances can be deceiving			0
on the field , history is being made			0
and the game 's most ardent fans -- in the heart of @entity38 country -- do n't seem to mind			1
facing @entity40 , @entity1 's rugby team -- the reigning world champions -- took to the field with a new black coach , @entity43 , and seven black players out of a team of 15 --- the most black players ever			1
fourteen years after democracy , it seems @entity1 's messy post-apartheid race relations are slowly being worked out on the sports field			1
" this is a new era			0
it changes the face of rugby			2
historically and politically it 's always seen as a white preserve			2
but the appointment of @entity43 is a huge change in terms of mind set , " @entity1 rugby president @entity56 told @entity2			1
is @entity1 sport doing enough to tackle the legacy of @entity20 ? have your say the man at the heart of this rugby revolution is easy to miss. amid the thick necks and even thicker thighs of a @entity11 training session , @entity43 is the short , slight man who seems to have perfected the art of disappearing into the crowd			1
in fact , the largest thing about him is his bushy moustache			0
it took us months to pin him down for an interview and he already has a reputation for dodging the media			0
i could n't figure out if he was nervous or just deeply suspicious of the press			0
but when i met him , i realized he does n't really care what people read or write about him			2
the whole interview is peppered with references to @entity88 or the @entity89 and he makes a point of saying that his life is certainly not going to be defined by him being the @entity11 coach			2
that said , he admits that " since my childhood i 've wanted to be a @entity11			0
to be a part of the set - up			0
but politics did n't allow us			0
" he says he was a good player -- but as a colored man he was barred from the white rugby set - up			1
in fact , during @entity20 , black and whites were not allowed to play sport together or against each other			0
the races were separated in all spheres of life			0
fourteen years since those days , has the sport managed to transform itself from white domination to a multi-racial institution ? yes , say the fans			1
@entity112 , @entity23 and by now tanked up with brandy and coke , we could not find one person who resented the new black @entity11			0
one group of burly men who were braai - ing @entity11 meat on kebabs , told us : " it is our team , we have to support them -- do n't think it bothers anyone as long as we can see them win			2
" and that 's probably the point			0
@entity1 are a competitive hard - nosed bunch ; they hate to see their side lose			2
so as long as the world champions are winning , the supporters will love them -- white or black			1
to complicate matters further , three of the @entity11 's black players are @entity135			1
but nobody seems to mind the " foreigners " either .			0

in @entity1 , rugby union was once symbolic of white domination
@entity1 rugby team now features seven black players -- the most ever
@entity43 is @entity1 's first black coach
rugby fans say they care more about winning than color of players ' *skins*
