@entity0 , @entity1 -- the idea that @entity4 did not write the works attributed to him did n't surface until 1856 , 240 years after he died			1
until then no one even suggested he might not have done so			0
the theory originated with an @entity9 woman , @entity8 , who spent a night in @entity10 , @entity11 trying to summon up the courage to open @entity4 's grave , apparently in the odd hope that its contents might help her case			1
she gave up with the morning light , and died not long afterwards in a lunatic asylum			0
since then however the theory has spread , to such an extent that now at least 77 people have been suggested as the author of the works attributed to @entity4 -- including such absurdities as queen elizabeth i and @entity26 , author of " @entity28			1
" for some time @entity29 was the leading candidate			0
he was supplanted by the poet and dramatist @entity30 , whose death in 1593 , when @entity4 's writings were just starting to appear , is one of the best recorded events in @entity1 literary history			1
the current favorite is @entity37 , seventeenth @entity38 , who died in 1604 , whereas @entity4 's plays go on appearing until 1613			1
an absurd story about him , suggesting that he was both the son of @entity25 and her lover , father by her of the @entity45 as well as the author of @entity4 , is told in the new film " @entity50 , " directed by @entity48 and starring @entity49 as the @entity25			1
the theory flies in the face of a mass of historical evidence			1
@entity4 is mentioned as the author of his poems and plays by at least fourteen contemporary writers			1
his name appears on the title pages of some 34 editions of plays and poems by him			0
anecdotes about him as a writer are told by his contemporary playwright and poet @entity66			0
in 1623 appeared the great @entity69 edition printing 37 of his plays			0
it has a long poem in praise of @entity4 written by @entity66 , which refers to him as the @entity76 ( the name of the river of his town of birth )			1
in @entity10 , @entity11 there is a monument to @entity4 with inscriptions comparing him to great figures of antiquity and praising him as a writer			2
in spite of all this and more , conspiracy theories about him constantly emerge in the press and elsewhere			0
most of them come not from scholars of literary history but from amateurs			0
many scholars have remained aloof from the debate , though i , who have spent most of my life studying , editing , writing about and teaching @entity4 , have taken part in numerous discussions and media debates of many kinds over the years			2
@entity108 , of @entity109 , published an excellent book , @entity111 , about the subject last year -- fascinatingly investigating the psychology of some of the better - known doubters , such as @entity116 and @entity117			0
disturbingly , the topic has spread to universities			0
it is now possible to take courses in the authorship of @entity4 at @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , @entity1			2
even more disturbingly the makers of the film are distributing to schools in @entity9 a study guide intended to sow seeds of doubt in the minds of schoolchildren			2
the @entity134 is the oldest organization devoted wholly to the man and his work			0
we are energetically pursuing a campaign to defend @entity4 's name , and have enlisted the help of many high profile figures , including the @entity142 , and a string of @entity145 actors and writers			2
we are about to launch a free e-book refuting the theory that @entity4 did n't write his works -- we profoundly hope that when you read it you will be completely convinced that @entity4 of @entity11 ( 1564 - 1616 ) is the author of the great plays and poems which carry his name round the world .			1
