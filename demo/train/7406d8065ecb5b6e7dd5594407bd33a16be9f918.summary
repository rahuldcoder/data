-- when president @entity2 addressed the nation the day 20 children were killed in @entity5 , @entity6 , he told the nation " that we are praying for them			0
" the moment " @entity11 " anchor @entity10 announced she had to undergo a bone marrow transplant , many prayers were directed her way			0
so why is it that sports fans are upset and bothered that @entity18 linebacker @entity17 consistently invokes @entity19 and @entity20 , and recites @entity22 scriptures ? we saw a lot of criticism toward @entity26 for the same thing			1
criticize him aplenty for not being able to throw the football , but hating on him because of his faith ? please , sit down			1
amid ' storybook ' ending , @entity17 is still controversial olympian @entity33 was on @entity34 's " @entity35 " friday and she said that it 's interesting that someone else will get more positive attention for releasing a sex tape while she is ridiculed for saying she 'll remain a virgin until she gets married			1
i 'll be honest , a lot of the criticism comes from individuals in the media who see religious people as weird and kooks			1
no , not all members of the media , but i can say in my experience as a reporter for 21 years that i have heard a lot of anti-religious , and especially anti-christian , stuff from my media brothers and sisters			2
in individual discussions working at newspapers , radio stations , tv and online outlets , folks have ridiculed the religious for having convictions that do n't line up with others ' political beliefs			2
yet what is so funny is that when those same individuals encountered a health crisis , had marital problems or issues with their children or were about to lose their job , they were the first ones to seek the @entity22 believer out for prayer			2
this really should n't come as a shock , because that 's how a lot of @entity80 are			0
when we do n't think we need to have a relationship with @entity19 , we 'll blow off praying or going to church			2
just let the good times roll , huh ? but just wait until something bad happens			0
man , we 'll flock to the nearest church , mosque or synagogue ; break out the prayer beads ; and blow the dust off of the @entity22 in order to be comforted			0
remember the night of september 11 , 2001 ? you would have been hard - pressed to find a seat in a house of worship			0
we were a prayer nation on that day , when nearly 3,000 of our brothers and sisters were killed in terrorist attacks			0
it does n't bother me one bit to see an athlete choose to be public with their faith			1
@entity19 bless ' em. and if another player makes the decision to not be as public , @entity19 bless them , too			1
the ridicule with being a strong person of faith comes with the territory			2
@entity116 , if @entity20 was mocked in his day , it 's no shock @entity17 , @entity26 or anyone else today will be ridiculed			1
but the key is to remain steadfast and strong			0
@entity20 told his followers in @entity121 to " go therefore and make disciples of all nations			0
" opinion : who is @entity19 backing in the @entity127 ? now before there was a @entity17 , there was a @entity130			1
just like @entity17 , @entity130 was trashed for his religious convictions			1
he was told to just shut up and play football			0
but if @entity19 gave @entity130 the gifts to do what he did , why not give him the glory ? as a devout @entity137 , i will not bend , and will stand strong in the faith when it comes to my religious convictions			1
afraid to say @entity20 on tv ? nope			0
in fact , the first four specials i hosted on @entity0 in 2007 were all religious specials			0
we may lose jobs , money , fame and public glory , but as long as my relationship with @entity19 stays intact , i 'm not bothered by the haters			1
does @entity19 want the @entity18 to beat the 49ers because of @entity17 ? no. are you betting on the @entity18 because you think @entity17 plays on @entity20 ? you better recognize that @entity19 is no bookie			1
we can all appreciate every player for what they bring to the table , and if they are believers in the faith , then @entity19 bless them			1
@entity17 and other players of faith have a tremendous platform			1
more than 100 million people will probably be watching on sunday			0
if someone makes a decision to accept @entity168 as their lord and @entity171 because they were inspired by @entity17 exhortation of his faith on @entity127 , great			1
if someone just wants to watch the game , no problem			0
but i will be thankful that a man who is undaunted by his critics will be unapologetic in professing his faith			0
@entity17 has faced the depths of evil in his past , and like @entity184 he went through his own @entity185 and has been transformed			2
no matter the faith or the occupation , there is nothing wrong with emerging from darkness and becoming a shining bright light			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity195 : why do people criticize @entity17 for invoking @entity19 ?
@entity195 : it 's because some individuals in the media see religious people as weird
he says but if something bad happens , those same people in the media will seek @entity19 too
@entity195 : we should not ridicule athletes who choose to be public about their faith
