-- six inches of snow in @entity2			1
a foot or so plastering the @entity4			1
and up to 20 inches expected just west of @entity5			0
surely , there 's a silver lining to these snow clouds though , right ? do n't they bring much - needed moisture to parched states ? not quite			1
@entity13 is very fluffy , and it takes up to a foot of it to squeeze out an inch of rain , meteorologists say			1
snowfall is " definitely a benefit , but not a drought - buster , " said @entity0 meteorologist @entity21			1
many drought - stricken states need a foot of rain , not snow			1
frozen ground when the ground is frozen , little of the moisture left by snow sinks into the soil			1
" all of the snow that has fallen over the winter by and large remains on top of the landscape , " said @entity31 's state climatologist @entity30			2
winter storm moves in on @entity5 when the sun comes out , it melts the snow first , while the ground remains hard , causing the water to flow off into lakes and rivers , or evaporating , instead of sinking in			2
@entity42 , @entity31 , has received 11.5 inches of snow since sunday morning , which amounts to about an inch of rain			1
not much for a state with levels of soil moisture near all - time lows , according to @entity31 's @entity51			0
" even flooding at this point wo n't alleviate a drought , " the agency said			0
but the recent snow will give river and lake levels a nice bump			2
the snow sent motorists sliding off of slick roads tuesday , in spite of widespread coverage with salt spread by trucks			2
plains states have it worst comparatively , @entity31 does n't have it that bad , according to @entity69			0
about half of the @entity71 is now " abnormally " to " moderately " dry , or worse			1
things look particularly bad west of the @entity74			0
when 21 inches fell on @entity76 , @entity77 , in february , it broke a monthly snowfall record set in 1913			1
but the state is still plagued by " severe , " " extreme " and " exceptional " drought , @entity69 said			0
@entity81 and @entity77 will keep more of the moisture the snow left behind , because the ground there is n't frozen , said meteorologist @entity86			2
only one state is drier , @entity88 , where @entity71 @entity69 is located at the @entity89 in @entity90			1
most of the state is going through an " exceptional " drought			0
climate change and snowfall record snow falls combined with record drought comes as no surprise to climatologists studying climate change			1
total snowfall in the western half of the country is dropping , said @entity104 climatologist @entity103 , which will mean less accumulation of moisture from snow			1
at the same time , the storms that sweep the @entity71 should grow more intense , said meteorologist @entity110 from the @entity111			1
with global warming , " we 're loading the dice or stacking the deck toward more intense blizzards , " he said			0
river water levels snowfall has bolstered water levels on the @entity74 , which had dropped due to drought , said @entity121 , spokeswoman for @entity122			2
when high temperatures dried out much of the country last summer , barges were restricted to floating at a depth of nine feet instead of 12 feet			0
recent snows have pushed water levels up enough to allow barges to run at 12 feet of depth again			0
@entity121 is afraid this might not hold , when the summer heat returns			0
water where it 's not needed as the current storm reaches the @entity137 coast , dumping snow on the nation 's capital , the white precipitation should become slushier and deliver more moisture per foot of snow , according to @entity0 's @entity143			1
the @entity5 and @entity144 are bracing for potentially significant accumulations , according to the @entity146			0
snow plows have been readied			2
airlines have canceled flights to and from @entity5 's @entity150 ahead of the storm 's arrival : @entity153 650 , @entity154 350 , @entity71 20			1
but by the time the storm gets there , it could turn to rain			2
the @entity159 does n't need it			0
it is already plenty moist , @entity69 said			0
in the parched plains states , snow has n't helped enough			0
they could use that rain			0
@entity0 's @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report			0

it takes up to a foot of snow to deliver an inch of rain
about half of the @entity71 is too dry
@entity2 sets snowfall record for the day
