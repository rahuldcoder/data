@entity0 -- thirty - five years since @entity2 , and little , it seems , has changed			1
the january 22 , 1973 , @entity5 decision legalizing abortion remains the law of the land , and passions remain high on both sides of the issue , with annual protests on the anniversary			1
access to abortion , then and now , is more than just about simple legalities			2
social , religious and family values , as well as finances and politics , still play a role in shaping the abortion issue , but many legal and medical experts say the debate has become predictable			1
" much of the controversy about abortion is really stimulated by the interest groups on both sides of the political question , rather than by ordinary @entity32 , " said @entity24 , a law professor at @entity26 , and a longtime @entity5 scholar			1
" the @entity32 people and many political leaders have already made up their minds about legal abortion			1
" public opinion on abortion has remained remarkably stable over the years			2
a @entity1 / @entity39 survey in october found 36 percent of @entity32 think abortion should be legal in most or all circumstances , 40 percent believe it should be available in a few circumstances , such as to save the mother 's life , and 22 percent say abortion should never be legal			1
that is almost unchanged in the past 15 years			0
the @entity2 decision did not prompt " abortion on demand , " as many opponents of the procedure predicted it would			1
nor have various legislatures or court rulings restricted access as much as some supporters claim			0
new research from the @entity54 found the rate of abortions is at its lowest level since @entity2 , and the total number is also in decline , about 1.2 million in the year 2005 , down 25 percent since the all - time high in 1990			1
for the @entity5 justices , @entity2 reflected earlier cases involving the right to privacy			1
that " right , " wrote justice @entity65 in the main opinion for the court , is " broad enough to encompass a woman 's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy			2
" " prior to @entity2 , " said @entity24 , " whether one could obtain a legal abortion in the face of an unwanted pregnancy was a crapshoot			1
for 30 years now , it 's been a constitutionally guaranteed right			0
" but the ruling was a qualified one , as many anti-abortion supporters have noted over the years , and that fact has been used by them in their efforts to narrow the scope of other abortion provisions			0
@entity65 noted the state 's " important interests in safeguarding health , maintaining medical standards , and protecting potential life " are compelling enough to justify regulation " at some point in pregnancy			0
" that " qualified right " found its form in the controversial " trimester analysis " laid out by the justices in @entity2 : permitting no government regulation during the first three months ; allowing limited regulation in the second trimester to protect women 's health and safety ; and granting government the power to ban abortions during the third trimester -- in which medical consensus has concluded the fetus is capable of living on its own			1
after @entity2 , the high court affirmed the right to abortion in subsequent cases : striking down a provision requiring a husband 's consent for a first - trimester abortion and a provision requiring parental consent for an unmarried woman under 18 ; striking down efforts to expand on laws requiring women to give informed consent before having an abortion ; striking down a 24 - hour waiting period ; and striking down a law requiring doctors to inform women of the risks and of assistance available if she completed pregnancy			1
but there was one notable victory for anti-abortionist activists : banning use of taxpayer funds to finance abortions for poor women			0
the abortion issue has been revisited several times since @entity2 , most famously in two cases : @entity142 ( 1989 ) and @entity143 ( 1992 )			1
@entity142 ( a 5 - 4 decision ) upheld major parts of a @entity147 abortion law that prohibited use of public facilities or the participation of public employees in abortions , and required doctors to test the viability of a fetus before performing an abortion			1
justices @entity157 , @entity159 and @entity160 said they would allow restrictions on abortion , but only if the restrictions had a rational basis			0
more important , the three conservative justices said a compelling government interest need not be required to justify restrictions on abortion			0
that was a blow for anti-abortion forces			0
then came the @entity170 ruling , in which the justices clearly outlined their views on @entity2			2
the decision ( also 5 - 4 ) reaffirmed the heart of @entity2 while giving states the power to regulate procedures so long as they did not impose an " undue burden " on a woman 's right to abortion			1
the standard : undue burden exists if " the purpose and effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability			0
" the ruling left supporters on both sides of the issue dissatisfied , feeling it was ambiguous			0
justice @entity198 did not join either opinion , saying there was nothing in it to justify reconsidering @entity2			2
nevertheless , @entity65 wrote , " the right to reproductive choice " was in danger of being overturned			0
another legacy of @entity2 that remains : the head - counting of justices on the court , a what - if scenario that could lead to the overturning of @entity2			2
the current 5 - 4 conservative majority could shift significantly in either direction if two or more justices leave the bench in the next few years , as is widely expected			0
in the meantime , conservatives in @entity218 have promised to push for tougher restrictions on the access to abortion , though many political experts say the goal is not necessarily aimed at overturning @entity2			1
they found success last year when the justices in a sharply divided 5 - 4 ruling upheld a federal ban on a controversial a late - term procedure , rejecting concerns the law did n't take into account the physical safety of the mother			0
the procedure is typically performed by doctors in the middle to late second trimester			0
the legal sticking point was that the law lacked a " health exception " for a woman who might suffer serious medical complications , something the justices have said in the past is necessary when considering abortion restrictions			2
the swing vote , as in previous cases , came from @entity160			0
in angry dissent , justice @entity248 , the lone woman on the high court since @entity198 stepped down , called the majority 's conclusions " alarming " and said they " can not be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away a right declared again and again by this court , and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women 's lives			0
" if there is one last legacy of the @entity2 decision , it may be that it opened up and expanded the entire debate on the rights of women , sexuality , health care , and medical decisions			1
issues like cloning , stem cells , and fetal research have become part of the national lexicon			0
as significant as it was , @entity2 was only the beginning of the battle			2
