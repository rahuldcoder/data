-- when you put a pro- and an anti-gun control person in the same room , you know what 's bound to happen			2
but what happens when two gun owners debate gun control ? turns out , there can be just as much disagreement			1
the elephant in the room in the wake of last week 's @entity16 movie theater shooting is the debate over gun control			1
gun control is not an either / or proposition			1
most would agree that at least some degree of regulation is necessary , so the real question is where to draw the line : at what point does regulation become an unreasonable encroachment on our @entity28 rights ? @entity0 selected two @entity30 with differing views on gun control to go head - to - head in a debate			1
both live in @entity36 , one of the 48 states where carrying concealed weapons is allowed			0
opinion : @entity42 's remarks got one thing right @entity44 is an anti-hunting gun owner			2
he carries a gun for protection while filming bears and other large mammals in the woods of @entity50 and @entity51			2
at home , he carries a gun to protect his family from intruders			2
while he owns two pistols , a shotgun for his videography work and two assault rifles , he supports stricter gun control			1
he suggests establishing a bullet registry as well as outlawing large - capacity magazines and teflon bullets			0
@entity44 refers to himself as a reluctant gun owner , and says he would prefer a world without guns			2
in fact , he would turn all his guns in if everyone else did the same			0
" i firmly believe fewer crimes of spontaneity or impulse would occur if there were fewer guns			0
but i recognize i am being unrealistic and idealistic , " he said			0
" it takes a societal change to get rid of the gun fanatic mentality anywhere in this world , and that kind of a change is not possible as long as the notion of ' freedom ' is associated with gun ownership			0
" opinion : @entity86 drives opposition to gun control a ban on guns is n't the answer , at least not from @entity93 ' perspective			1
he believes there is a good system in place for gun control and says changing the law would n't change what happened in @entity16			1
his reasons are personal : as a former convicted felon -- he was convicted of burglary and possession of drugs -- he was stripped of his right to bear arms			0
@entity93 says his run - ins with the law and his loss of gun rights demonstrate the legitimacy and stringency of gun control in @entity114			1
he now works as a substance - abuse counselor			0
" the process that i went through , 15 years of not being able to possess firearms and then the process to petition the courts to get those rights back , was worth it , " he said			0
" worth it in the sense that it showed me that it is a privilege in our nation to be in possession of firearms			0
now , looking back , there is a pretty good system in place for who can and who can not possess firearms after certain crimes are committed			0
" opinion : when will @entity114 wake up to gun violence ? @entity93 and @entity44 are two of the hundreds of @entity30 who have shared their views on a variety of hot - button political issues in the @entity141 , an eight - month project that invites voters to make their voices heard this election season			1
the project started with @entity30 sharing which issue matters most to them			0
the top - voted issues determined the topics for the head - to - head debates , and will shape the questions that @entity0 ultimately takes to president @entity152 and likely @entity154 presidential nominee gov. @entity153			1
