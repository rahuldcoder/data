-- @entity1 , the most closely watched comet in recent years , may be falling apart as it nears its close encounter with the sun. comets are giant snowballs of frozen gases , rock and dust that can be several miles in diameter			1
when they get near the sun , they warm up and spew out some of the gas and dirt , creating a tail that can stretch for thousands of miles			2
most comets are in the outer part of our solar system			0
when they get close enough for us to see them , scientists study them for clues about how our solar system formed			0
when @entity1 was first discovered , hopes were high that it might become visible to the naked eye , meaning everyone might be able see it , not just those with good telescopes who took the trouble to find it			1
there was talk it might even rival some of the @entity36 like @entity37 's or @entity38 and spread a huge tail across the sky			1
but some observers on tuesday reported online that the comet is not nearly as bright as it has been in recent days and that it may be pouring out dust			0
this could mean the comet 's core , or nucleus , has " completely disrupted , releasing an enormous volume of dust , " @entity45 's @entity44 says in its november 25 online update			0
but other observers say images taken by @entity45 's stereo spacecraft are " encouraging evidence that the comet still exists , " @entity53 with the @entity1 campaign told reporters on the campaign 's @entity62 page			1
she added that it 's too early to tell what kind of shape the comet is in , though			0
" i believe the next couple of days will be crucial to determine the post-perihelion appearance of the comet , " @entity53 said			0
@entity71 is the point in an object 's path that is closest to the sun. 5 things to know about @entity1 whatever its final fate , she said , @entity1 has " provided a wonderful window into the world of comets			1
the full understanding of this comet and its place in the taxonomy of comets will only come in hindsight			0
" @entity1 was discovered in september of 2012 by astronomers @entity87 and @entity89 using a telescope near @entity91 , @entity92 , that is part of the @entity94 ( @entity1 )			1
@entity1 -- officially named @entity95 -- was 585 million miles away at the time			1
its amazing journey through the solar system has been chronicled by amateur astronomers and by space telescopes			0
@entity45 has even created a toolkit for @entity1 fans			1
confusion about its fate is n't new for @entity1 watchers			2
" from the moment of discovery , @entity1 has been a confusing , frustrating , dynamic and unpredictable object			2
in other words , it has been a very typical comet ! " said @entity108 , an astrophysicist with the @entity109 in @entity110			0
the glare of the sun has blocked most ground - based observations , but @entity45 has a fleet of spacecraft watching as @entity1 plunges toward the sun. if it has n't already broken up , it will skim about 730,000 miles above its surface on @entity121 and could put on a sky show in early december when it moves out of the glare of the sun. the comet will make its closest approach to @entity127 on december 26 , and , no , it wo n't hit us			1
but for now , we wait to learn @entity1 's fate			2
" i am excited at marking the progress of this comet that has captivated the world from its discovery and the possibility of it being a @entity36 , " @entity53 told @entity0			2
" i am glad that i was able to be part of its journey			0

@entity1 may or may not be breaking up
@entity36 could put on *spectacular* show if it survives
@entity1 is currently flying toward the sun
