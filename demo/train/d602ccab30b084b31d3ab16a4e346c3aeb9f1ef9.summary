-- when you are creating the most anticipated horror video game of 2013 , there is a certain trepidation about how you are going to bring the scares to your audience			1
@entity7 hopes it 's up to the challenge with its latest title , " @entity10			1
" in the series ' third installment , everyone 's favorite head case , @entity13 , is back , and still trying to get the visions of a twisted future out of his head			2
aliens are still transforming humans into hideous necromorphs ( zombie - like creatures made from different body parts ) and it is up to @entity24 to save humanity from a fate worse than death			2
@entity28 , executive producer of the " @entity30 " franchise , said his team recognized that keeping things fresh and scary for fans in the third title would be a challenge			1
it was easy to frighten players in the first game just by introducing the team 's horrifying creations , and the second title offered new scares by changing the pacing of the action			1
' @entity45 ' is scary , limb - slicing fun ' @entity30 : extraction ' ( the first of the series ) this time , @entity28 said , the developers are adding new creatures and answering plot questions that have lingered throughout the franchise			1
however , they really wanted to dive into the head of @entity24 more than in previous titles , and in co-op play , that element takes on a new life			2
" when you decide to play with a friend , you get details about @entity63 ( the co-op character ) and his back story and his personal journey , " @entity28 said			1
" we actually leverage that by delivering psychological horror moments			1
you 'll have the psychological dementia that only occur in co-op and really bring details out			1
" @entity28 said those dementia moments are highlighted by action occurring on one player 's screen while the other player sees nothing			2
for example , @entity78 may see @entity80 grabbing his head and asking what 's going on			2
meanwhile , @entity83 is involved in a battle for his life against necromorphs			2
the question then becomes which character is seeing the world as it really is			2
" @entity90 will conquer fear even more than bravery will			2
" -- @entity93 , " @entity94 " the development team at @entity7 also moved away from " timed " scares , frightening moments that are keyed by a character moving to a specific spot in the game			1
they focused on an overall package of elements -- music , characters , mental tension and even background environments -- to create the feeling of angst players have come to enjoy from the franchise			0
" one of the things we looked at over the course of this game is how does our environment play into scares ? that 's why we really liked the concept of ( icy planet ) @entity120 , " @entity28 said			1
" it spoke to us about things like survival , subzero conditions , low visibility			0
" all these things reinforce the horror element			1
how can we surprise and delight and keep the players guessing ? " @entity28 proudly said he has no fear			0
however , when pushed , he admitted he does get vertigo from time to time when he 's high in the air			0
he said when designing the horror moments in the game , his team members search for the " relatability moments , " things that frighten them and in turn will frighten the player			1
he said the visual moments in the game that could potentially happen , or that players could envision happening , create the most fear and tension			1
" the enemies , for instance			0
these are twisted , suffering humans			0
the fact you can see the necromorphs with their limbs twisted , spiky bits are sticking up , jaws are missing -- that resonates at a primal level , because you look at it and go , " wow			0
that would be super painful to have that happen to me			0
' " " you can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you			0
" -- @entity161 @entity28 said the game 's art and design teams also pushed the boundaries of current gaming systems to make scary moments look and feel even more traumatic			1
" there are definitely more things to do , " @entity28 said			0
" we 've added a lot more exploration elements			0
" he is hoping players will get deep into the missions , find out more about the characters and grow more attached to what happens to @entity24			0
it gives him personal enjoyment when players talk about getting emotionally invested in the game -- through either the story or the horror			1
" it takes such a big effort for the team to create some of these scenarios			1
when you hear a player talk about the moments in a way that expresses how much fun or tension or excitement they had playing through them , it is extremely satisfying and one of the coolest things about making games , " he said			0
while he would n't reveal what he would call his " @entity203 moment " in the game , @entity28 said there are definitely a couple of moments in that will surprise and shock players			2
" we 're anxious to see how our players react to them , " he said			0
as such , @entity28 is inviting players to reach out on @entity212 to him ( @ leveluptime ) as they play			0
he said he enjoys bouncing ideas off fans and is very interested in their reactions to the latest chapter in the franchise			0
" @entity10 " became available tuesday in @entity220 and releases thursday in @entity222 and friday in @entity223			1
it can be played on the @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227			0
it is rated m for mature due to blood and gore , intense violence and strong language .			0

in " @entity10 , " developers explore psychological horror to keep up the scares
producer says his team knew they needed to keep the story fresh
" @entity10 " is the most anticipated horror game of 2013
