@entity0 -- as the @entity5 primary reaches its halfway point , the question of inevitability is a main topic of conversation			1
is former @entity10 gov. @entity9 , who holds a sizable lead in delegates , destined to be the @entity5 nominee for president in 2012 ? while @entity9 's campaign says yes , his three rivals argue otherwise			1
mathematically , former sen. @entity17 , former house speaker @entity18 and rep. @entity19 all still have a chance to win the nomination			1
but the odds are quickly stacking against each one of them			1
one mishap now could cost them the chance of an outright win before the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30			1
how to win the nomination every primary contest comes down to one thing : amassing as many delegates as possible			1
these delegates are elected to go to the national convention , where they will officially nominate the candidate to represent the @entity5 in the general election against president @entity39			1
it takes 1,144 delegates to win the @entity5 nomination			1
as of monday , @entity1 estimates that @entity9 has 519 delegates , @entity17 has 239 , @entity44 has 138 , and @entity19 has 69			1
delegates are allocated based on primary and caucus results , per the state @entity5 's rules			1
the rules differ from state to state , but most are approved by the @entity53			0
some states have a one - day primary , some have a multistep caucus system , and others have a mix of the two			0
@entity60 , @entity61 , @entity30 , @entity62 and @entity63 were penalized for moving their primaries outside the window authorized by the national committee			0
the road to 1,144 @entity9 's delegate total puts the odds in his favor			1
@entity1 estimates that there are 1,290 delegates up for grabs , meaning @entity9 would need 49 % of the remaining delegates to win the nomination			1
his plan : stay the course			0
" we 're going to the convention with more than 1,144 delegates , " said @entity78 , @entity9 's political director			1
" we 're going to do what we 've always done			0
we 've had a plan since day one			0
" contests in @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity0 appear to favor @entity9			1
but the way the rules read , most delegates are awarded in a proportional manner , making it almost impossible for one candidate to win them all in one contest			1
there are some contests remaining in which delegates are winner - take - all : @entity0 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			2
that does not mean @entity17 ca n't catch up			2
he needs 70 % of the remaining delegates to win the nomination before the convention			1
@entity17 's focus : the may contests			1
" we believe that may 8th is the beginning of the end for @entity9 and the date that puts @entity17 on a path to the nomination , " @entity108 , a @entity17 strategist , wrote in a recent campaign memo			1
@entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 vote that day ; a win in all three could be pivotal to changing the momentum of the race			2
@entity17 is n't the only one looking ahead to may			2
the @entity44 campaign believes those and other may contests such as @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 will be fertile ground for delegates as well			1
the 152 delegates at stake in @entity125 could be a boon for all the candidates			2
@entity44 has the endorsement of gov. @entity133 , who unsuccessfully sought the @entity5 presidential nomination			1
expect @entity44 to lean on @entity133 when the primary turns to @entity125			2
" with 4 candidates remaining , the @entity5 nomination now moves into unchartered waters with history in the making , " wrote @entity136 , senior adviser , and @entity138 , political director to @entity44 , in a recent campaign memo			1
" the sequencing and pace of the second half favors @entity18			0
" for @entity44 and @entity19 , the numbers are more difficult			1
they need 78 % and 83 % of the remaining delegates , respectively , to earn the nomination			2
@entity19 's plan : unpledged delegates			1
delegates : pledged , unplugged and the power to switch not all delegates are the same			2
" pledged " delegates are required to vote for the candidate based on the results of their state 's contests			2
" @entity164 " delegates are allowed to vote for any candidate they choose , regardless of the results in their state			0
for @entity19 , this could mean picking up delegates in states that have already held their first round of voting			1
in many caucus states , the first round usually has a nonbinding presidential straw poll and an election of delegates to another local convention			0
these delegates then go to a county , congressional district or state convention			0
at this second - stage convention , which could occur months after the initial vote , the actual delegates for @entity29 are selected			0
the process varies from state to state			0
in some states such as @entity192 , delegate selections are done at different events			0
congressional district delegates are elected at the district conventions , while at - large delegates are elected at the state convention			0
this is where the @entity19 campaign sees an opening			2
the congressman is counting on his strong grass - roots organization to help him pick up delegates at these local conventions			0
" our campaign has continued to follow up and work the delegate selection processes in the states where contests have already been held , and we plan to work hard to collect delegates in upcoming states where the awarding of delegates is proportional , " @entity206 , @entity19 's national press secretary , said in a statement			1
" no one can afford to think too far ahead right now , it is still a wide open race so our campaign will continue to hunt for as many delegates as we can gain up until the convention			0
" most of the delegate - selecting conventions in caucus states have yet to take place			0
in @entity226 , @entity19 did see a loss of a couple of delegates between the first straw poll and the county conventions			1
his supporters will have to rally stronger to make sure he maintains -- if not picks up -- delegates			0
unpledged delegates can also change their minds and vote for a different candidate			0
this is why it is extremely important for campaigns to have strong organization to try and pick up new delegates , while making sure they hold on to unpledged delegates who expressed support			0
" the accumulation concept is analogous to attaining one 's @entity248 -- harder to bring up than to start up -- so is the delegate horse trading , " said @entity245 , a former campaign adviser for @entity246			0
" if you do n't have good solid , ' political ' ones and full slates from the get - go , it 's harder , if even possible , to move them around			0
" the three most important delegates unpledged delegates will sometimes follow three key members of their state 's delegation : the party chair and the two national committee members			2
except in states where they 've lost their vote due to a penalty , these three members are part of every voting delegation at the convention			0
the three members are leaders in the party and often have contact and influence with the campaigns and their state 's delegation			0
if the convention is brokered , they can advise delegates on possibly switching their vote on a second or third ballot			0
" they become magnifying forces for other unpledged or second ballot switchers , " @entity245 said			0
most pledged delegates are bound only on the first vote , making it crucial for any candidate who does not want a floor fight at the convention to lock up their delegates ahead of time			0
the three committee members can help accomplish that			0
while a brokered convention might not seem like a pressing issue , @entity5 leaders will want to avoid the chaos			2
it takes to time prepare to run a national campaign , which the winning candidate wo n't have if the nomination is n't decided until late august in @entity29			2
if you 're a @entity5 national delegate , that 's the last thing you want , for one important reason			1
" essentially , what they 're saying is that ' we have a nominee with 60 days to go against @entity39 , the most funded president in @entity312 history , ' " said @entity78 , @entity9 's political director			1
" my guess is , if you 're a delegate to the @entity28 , you want to beat @entity39 , and this is not how you 're going to do it			0
" @entity1 political research director @entity315 contributed to this report .			2

it takes 1,144 delegates to win the @entity5 nomination
@entity1 estimate : @entity9 has 519 delegates , @entity17 has 239 , @entity44 has 138 , @entity19 has 69
mathematically , @entity17 , @entity44 and @entity19 all still have a chance to win the nomination
but the odds are quickly stacking against each of @entity9 's rivals
