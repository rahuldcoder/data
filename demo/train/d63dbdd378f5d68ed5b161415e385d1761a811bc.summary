@entity0 , @entity1 -- five men and four women have been selected to be jurors in the @entity1 trial of @entity7 , the former @entity8 assistant football coach charged with child rape			1
about 220 potential jurors reported for duty tuesday , after the court whittled the number to about 600 based on answers to questionnaires sent to prospective jurors ' homes			2
of those , about half were sent home and asked to return wednesday			0
" we are now making good progress , " judge @entity21 said late tuesday afternoon			0
twelve jurors and four alternates will eventually be selected			0
@entity7 , 68 , has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys for at least 15 years			1
prosecutors allege he met some of his accusers through @entity31 , a charity he created for underprivileged children			1
he has pleaded not guilty to the charges			2
he and his attorney , @entity34 , were in attendance tuesday			0
keys to the case against @entity7 opening statements are expected to begin monday , the judge said , and the trial is likely to last about three weeks			1
@entity7 supposedly wrote love letters to one of his alleged victims , victim 4 , @entity41 reported late tuesday			1
they will be read into testimony , @entity41 said			0
when asked by @entity2 about the report , the attorney for @entity47 , @entity48 , said he expects that letters from @entity7 to his client will be introduced at trial , but declined to comment on their content			1
@entity55 allegedly gave to victim 4 may also be introduced as evidence by prosecutors , according to a source close to the case			2
those gifts could include golf clubs and football jerseys , the source said			0
a source close to another alleged victim , victim 1 , said @entity65 received birthday cards and notes from @entity7 , but that they were not sexually explicit in nature			1
they included statements such as , " i love you , " but did not contain anything overtly sexual , that source said			0
authorities allege that @entity7 abused some of the boys on the @entity8 campus			1
the case has shaken the university , raised questions about its response to the allegations and drawn criticism from those who claim @entity8 put its reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims			2
university president @entity87 and iconic head football coach @entity86 lost their jobs soon after @entity7 's arrest amid criticism that they did not adequately handle the matter when allegations involving @entity7 arose years earlier			1
@entity86 died of complications from lung cancer in january			0
@entity96 , a former graduate student considered to be a key witness in the @entity7 case , has testified that he alerted @entity86 in 2002 that he 'd seen what appeared to be @entity7 sexually assaulting a boy in a shower in @entity8 's athletic facilities , an allegation that authorities did n't learn of until years later			1
@entity86 apparently told the university 's athletic director , @entity105 , but no one notified police			0
@entity105 and @entity109 , @entity8 's senior vice president for finance and business , are now facing felony charges of perjury and failing to report the allegations to authorities			2
prosecutors said later that the @entity96 incident took place about a year earlier than was originally alleged , causing defense attorneys for @entity105 and @entity119 to argue that one of the charges should now be dropped			1
both of them have pleaded not guilty , and their attorneys have said that prosecutors " charged this case before ( they ) knew the facts			2
" potential jurors were asked tuesday about their relationships with @entity8 , local law enforcement and @entity31 , and whether they had contributed to any of those entities			0
several reported knowing @entity7 or his wife , while others said they had volunteered at @entity31			1
others said they were current or former @entity8 employees			0
prosecutors plan to call more than 50 witnesses during the trial , and the defense plans to call about 100 , including @entity140 and @entity141 , @entity86 's son and widow ; @entity96 ; his father , @entity144 ; and @entity87 , among others			1
the prosecution is preparing witnesses for their testimony next week , according to several sources close to the case			2
the 28 - year - old man known as @entity152 is expected to testify first , with victim 1 , who started the investigation by coming forward in 2008 and alleging years of abuse , to follow , the sources said			1
@entity96 and his father were told to be in town and ready to testify next wednesday or thursday , one of the sources said			0
@entity21 told members of the jury pool that jurors in the case will not be sequestered , saying he will trust them not to read newspapers or follow the case online			2
he told the prospective jurors that after he speaks with them , groups will be taken to another room for questioning and then to a different room for more questioning from the judge and attorneys			0
if they are selected , he said , they will be taken to a different room			0
" we 're using all the rooms , " @entity21 quipped as pool members chuckled			0
@entity7 listened intently to the judge as he spoke to the jury pool , also chuckling at times			1
but he looked down when the judge discussed the charges against him			2
as jury selection in the case began tuesday , @entity8 released a statement , saying , " the acts that @entity7 is accused of committing are horrible and if proven true , deserve punishment			1
" the university said it would not comment on the specifics of the legal case , but said it hopes that the trial " provides answers we are all seeking " and that " the legal process will start to bring closure to the alleged victims and families whose lives have been irrevocably impacted and that they can begin the healing process			2
" several of @entity7 's alleged victims , including @entity47 , asked a judge to protect their identities at trial			1
however , @entity21 ruled monday that the alleged victims ' identities may not be concealed during the trial , although they will be protected through the jury selection process			1
" courts are not customarily in the business of withholding information , " @entity21 's ruling said			0
" secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully			0
" prosecutors in @entity7 case present new , graphic details but , the judge noted , " it is also to be hoped that various news organizations that will report on the trial will use what has become their professional custom to protect the privacy of alleged victims			1
" @entity2 generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault			0
victim advocacy groups criticized the judge 's decision late monday , expressing their hope that it would not have a chilling effect on the reporting of child sexual abuse			2
" the judge placed a significant burden on this class of victims by stating that they have ' a duty to the community to testify ' about the crime , but denying them privacy protections in exchange for that testimony			0
by bravely coming forward , victims serve in the interest of public safety ; they should be assured that their privacy will be protected , " the @entity246 , the @entity247 and the @entity248 said in a joint statement			0
" in society , sometimes we question why rape victims are reluctant to come forward , " @entity48 , attorney for @entity152 , said monday after the ruling			2
" so now we have our answer			0
" " we are not asking to close the courtroom , only to use a pseudonym , " he said			0
his client will still testify , he said , " but at what expense to his emotional well - being ? " he said he expects the defense to attack his client on the basis of a meeting he had with @entity7 in the years after the alleged abuse			1
" my client could n't break free , " said the attorney , describing the relationship between @entity47 and @entity7 as " complex			1
" psychologist flagged @entity7 as ' likely pedophile ' in 1998 report after news of the scandal broke last year , the @entity277 published an extensive interview in which @entity7 attempted to clarify his relationships with young people			1
" if i say , ' no , i 'm not attracted to young boys , ' that 's not the truth , " he said , according to the story			2
" because i 'm attracted to young people -- boys , girls -- i ... " his lawyer , who was present at the interview , spoke up at that point to note that @entity7 is " not sexually " attracted to them			1
i enjoy -- that 's what i was trying to say -- i enjoy spending time with young people			0
i enjoy spending time with people , " @entity7 continued			1
" i mean , my two favorite groups are the elderly and the young			0
" @entity2 's @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 and @entity2 contributor @entity302 contributed to this report .			0
