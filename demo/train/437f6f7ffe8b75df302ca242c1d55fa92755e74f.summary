-- security cameras were rolling when a killer whale at @entity5 's @entity4 park grabbed a trainer by her hair and pulled her underwater , leading to her death			1
now @entity5 and the family of @entity11 are fighting to keep videos and photos related to her death out of the public eye			1
a @entity4 judge on thursday granted a request from @entity18 to join in a lawsuit filed last week by @entity11 's family seeking to prevent the release of the footage , which was captured at @entity5 's @entity23 , @entity4 , park on february 24			1
@entity11 was interacting with an orca named @entity25 when the animal grabbed her ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at @entity30			1
she died from " multiple traumatic injuries and drowning , " the @entity31 said			0
portions of the incident were captured on two cameras at the park -- one that shows a view from under water and another from that park 's @entity41 , according to the family 's complaint , which was filed last week			1
" the underwater view does not show mrs. @entity11 until after she had entered the water			2
the overhead camera was not aimed at the scene until after the incident had begun , " the complaint states			0
" significantly neither camera shows what occurred in the moments prior to and including mrs. @entity11 being pulled into the water and offer no insight into the cause of this tragic event			2
" @entity11 's family filed the complaint against the @entity57 and the @entity58 , who have possession of the footage			1
@entity63 judge @entity62 granted a temporary injunction of the release of the footage , noting that the sheriff 's office filed a notice with the court stating it had no position on the matter			1
the medical examiner 's office also filed a notice of no objection to the @entity11 family 's complaint			1
@entity77 : @entity78 , @entity79 speak out on @entity5 incident in a motion filed monday , @entity5 claimed it has an interest in the pending litigation because it is the exclusive owner of the footage			2
if possession of the videos is not controlled , the motion further claims , " it is almost a certainty that they will be made publicly available on the @entity89 , " causing @entity5 to lose its exclusive right to the video			0
" further , @entity5 's interests are generally aligned with the @entity98 ' interests , and @entity5 , as the former employer of mrs. @entity11 , seeks to assist plaintiffs in protecting their privacy interests , " the motion states			1
@entity5 also expressed concern that members of the media will be able to gain access to the videos if they become part of an investigative file with law enforcement			2
in fact , @entity4 's broad laws regarding access to public documents creates a great likelihood of such a possibility , said @entity0 legal analyst @entity116			0
" as a general rule , matters of a police file are public record , and the media has access to contents of a police file			0
most mainstream media are not going to broadcast someone being killed or someone 's remains , but it 's a matter of having that access to decide how to use it , " @entity116 said			0
" law enforcement files have to be released in @entity4 , so the media has a very strong argument not only under federal @entity135 laws but also under @entity4 access laws , " @entity116 said			0
the @entity11 family 's lawsuit marks the second time this month that a family has asked the courts to intervene in the release of footage depicting dead loved ones			1
earlier this month , another family made a similar appeal to the courts involving the release of photos depicting dead loved ones			0
the family of slain hiker @entity151 last week asked a @entity153 judge to issue an order preventing the release of crime scene photos depicting her nude and dismembered body			2
a reporter on assignment for @entity162 requested the photos for a story he was doing , according to the adult magazine			0
a judge granted a temporary order in the case preventing the photos ' release pending a hearing on the matter .			0
