@entity0 -- president @entity3 's decision to take executive action on immigration won praise from the religious community sunday , when a leader of the @entity10 @entity9 endorsed the move			1
" the bishops of the @entity10 -- we 're very much in favor of action being taken to protect people who need to come out of the shadows , " newly appointed archbishop of @entity21 , @entity20 , said sunday on @entity13 ' " @entity12			1
" " it 's been too long of a time for people to wait for comprehensive immigration reform , " he continued			2
" and so we see this as an important first step hopefully to jump start what 's happening			0
" @entity20 , the ninth archbishop of @entity21 , is pope @entity30 ' first @entity10 appointed archbishop			1
his position generally reflects what the @entity32 of @entity33 have called for in the past : a path to citizenship and government autonomy over the law enforcement process at the border			0
over the past week , republicans have been quick to slam the president for taking unilateral action , with some going as far as comparing him to a monarch or an emperor			2
on sunday , @entity20 said it 's important for the president to compromise with @entity49 -- including the @entity51 - led @entity50 which has stalled on an immigration bill for the past 15 months			1
" i think it 's very important that this be done very carefully but we applaud it as good first step , " @entity20 said			1
" more needs to be done			0
we encourage the president and members of @entity49 to get this work done			0
" @entity20 also admitted that he has some privacy concerns for illegal immigrants , should @entity3 's policy be overturned by a @entity51 president in the future			1
" my concern would be that we would have a policy and procedure that would have a confidentiality provision because if people come out of the shadows and sign up and give their names and information , they want to make sure that that is going to be protected in the future should the executive order change by another administration , " @entity20 said			2
according to @entity20 , who served as the sixth bishop of the @entity82 from 2010 until recently , amnesty is not just a priority of @entity3 's , but also @entity84 's			1

we have to attend to that , " @entity20 said			0
" this is not something that they 're wanting on their own but @entity84 has always called us to a better life , has always called us to experiencing how we can provide for our families in a better way , " he continued			0
" i think that being the grandson of immigrants i feel that very deeply			0
