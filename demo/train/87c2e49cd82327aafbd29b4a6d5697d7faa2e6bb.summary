-- a federal judge in @entity3 , @entity1 blocked thursday parts of the state 's anti-illegal immigration law approved by the legislature last summer			1
district judge @entity8 blocked three parts of the law , known both as @entity11 and @entity12			1
the first section blocked makes it a felony to transport or conceal a person " with intent to further that person 's unlawful entry into the @entity20 " or to help that person avoid apprehension			2
a second section makes it unlawful for an adult to " fail to carry " an alien registration card or receipt			0
and the final section blocked would have allowed local law enforcement with " reasonable suspicion " to detain any person the officers believe is in the @entity20 illegally			2
@entity1 attorney general @entity32 focused on the parts of the law that @entity8 let stand			1
" the @entity36 will ultimately decide this matter in the coming year			0
until then , it appears that many important aspects of the @entity1 law will go into effect on 1 - 1 - 2012 , " said @entity32			1
but the @entity42 , which had challenged the law , praised the judge 's decision			1
" we are very pleased that the judge decided to block the most problematic previsions of the law " said @entity45 , an @entity42 attorney who argued against the bill adding " this is yet another setback for this anti immigration legislation that we 've seen in other states and we 've now seen the majority of courts that have weighed in these issues have decided that these laws are unconstitutional and should be blocked while there is a full hearing in the matter			1
" @entity11 was approved by the state legislature and signed by gov. @entity61 on june 27			0
it includes new requirements for the verification of legal status of new workers			0
in addition it has the requirement that the legal status of prisoners be checked and mandates the transfer of illegal immigrants to federal authorities after they complete their sentences			0
@entity76 , @entity61 's spokesman said , " if the feds were doing their job , we would n't have had to address illegal immigration reform at the state level			2
but , until they do , we 're going to keep fighting in @entity1 to be able to enforce our laws			2
governor @entity61 is hopeful that the @entity20 @entity36 will soon do what @entity86 and the executive branch have failed to do , which is allow the states to pick up the slack where @entity91 has failed			0
" @entity0 's @entity92 and @entity93 contributed to this report			0
