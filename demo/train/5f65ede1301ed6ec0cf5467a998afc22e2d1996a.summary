@entity1 @entity0 has had a number of glory days since he played church league basketball in @entity6			1
but in an interview on thursday , the former president reminisced about the unexpected high point in his athletic life			2
@entity0 called into the @entity12 show on @entity13 to talk about @entity15 event this weekend in @entity16			1
the event is partly run by the @entity17 and coincides with a @entity0 foundation summit on personal health			1
but the hosts , @entity21 and @entity22 , got the former president to talk about that time he " almost " dunked a basketball in a church league game			1
" i was in a church league			1
i was n't very good , i was too heavy			0
but i would run pretty well in short distances , " @entity0 said			2
" one night i was the leading scorer on our team			0
i scored 16 points in a church league game , never have before or since			1
" he then added , " and i nearly dunked a ball ! and i was only , at the time , six feet tall			2
i do n't know what happened			0
it was just one of those magical nights			1
my hand got like right at the rim and i almost got the ball dunked in			1
i figured maybe every human being on earth is granted one good day in a sports game			0
" @entity0 has long been an avid sports fan and has remarked in the past that he watched more games while his wife , @entity45 , was traveling for work as secretary of state			2
while in the @entity48 , @entity0 also had the opportunity -- as all presidents do -- to congratulate and meet championship teams from the major @entity53 sports leagues , something , he said , he " really , really enjoyed			1
" " i had incredible encounters with some of the athletes that would say hilarious things to me , " @entity0 said remembering those meetings			1
" one football team , and i wo n't say with one , one of their greatest defensive players through his massive arm around me and he said , ' i may be the only person here who voted for you			0
" @entity0 was also an avid golfer in the @entity48 and recently took to defending president @entity68 against heat he occasionally takes for golfing			1
the former president said the most star struck he was on the course was when he played two rounds with @entity75 , a legendary golfer with 18 career major wins			1
" we played this one par 5 hole , " @entity0 remembered			2
" and i out drove @entity75 by a foot			2
he looks at me and i could tell he did n't like it			0
" he continued : " we were both on this par 5 hole in 2 [ shots ] and i was only eight feet away from an eagle			0
i had never had an eagle on a par 5 hole			0
and i literally stubbed the putt			0
it was the worst put you could have imagined			0
@entity91 looked at me and said , ' you did n't think you were worthy of an eagle , did you ? ' i said , ' i guess not			0
' he smiled and he said , ' you need to get over that			0
' i 'll never forget that for as long as i live			0
