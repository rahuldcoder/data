-- your kids deserve better			0
because @entity4 failed to pass the @entity5 last week , bad school lunches will remain bad			1
while the bill was n't perfect , it would have created stronger nutritional standards and provided more money for the school lunch program -- adding six cents per lunch for the first time in 30 years			0
this was the first step on the long ladder to fresh food , and now it 's a missed opportunity			2
among other things , this bill would have banned the junk food that is served in schools and competes with the fresh food your kids need			1
eating this junk every day will take 10 years off their lives and cost you a fortune -- adding thousands of dollars to the family health care tab			1
when @entity4 returns , members should not only support these new standards but also give people the necessary dollars to get on the path to fresh food			1
at the moment , $ 4.5 billion is attached to the bill , which only works out to six cents on the plate -- not much , but better than nothing if it can buy an apple for each child 's breakfast or lunch tray			0
over the last two years , more than 700 advocacy groups have been working to get these important changes written into law			1
yet @entity4 could not bring enough support to pass the bill			2
do members not value the health of @entity49 's kids ? since i 've been working in @entity49 , i 've been overwhelmed by the number of people who write to me			1
more than 600,000 people have signed the @entity55 petition for better school food			2
they are really worried about the quality of food their kids are served in school -- the soda , chocolate milk and pizza for breakfast , lunch and dinner			1
it 's not just me who thinks we need change			0
parents deserve to know what their kids are being fed at school			1
if @entity4 wo n't put the regulations in place , then @entity49 are going to have to take things into their own hands			2
here 's how you do it : drop into school and eat lunch with your child			2
see for yourself what is being served on the breakfast and lunch trays			0
if you do n't like what you see , find other parents in your school who are as frustrated and disgusted as you are			1
band together and go to your school board and demand change			0
go visit them and thank them			0
let them know you appreciate that they take care of your kids and that you want to help them get better equipment , training and information to make their jobs easier			0
send e-mails , meet your school nutrition director , go to @entity108 meetings , get your kids involved			0
take every opportunity to keep school food change front and center			0
if this bill does n't get passed when @entity4 comes back in november , then it 's going to be another five years before we have another shot at fixing these regulations			1
five years is too long to wait			0
without this legislation , school food will stay in the @entity119 of nutrition and your kids are going to suffer			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity123 .			0

@entity123 : @entity5 failed , which means same old *unhealthy* school lunches
schools serve junk food like chocolate milk , soda and pizza at each meal , he writes
700 groups want this kind of law , he writes . does @entity4 not value children 's health ?
parents should see what kids are eating , @entity123 says , and if disgusted , push for healthy food
