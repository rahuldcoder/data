@entity1 drone strikes in @entity2 have killed far more people than the @entity1 has acknowledged , have traumatized innocent residents and largely been ineffective , according to a new study released tuesday			1
the study by @entity7 and @entity9 's @entity8 calls for a re-evaluation of the practice , saying the number of " high - level " targets killed as a percentage of total casualties is extremely low -- about 2 %			1
the report accuses @entity17 of misrepresenting drone strikes as " a surgically precise and effective tool that makes the @entity1 safer , " saying that in reality , " there is significant evidence that @entity1 drone strikes have injured and killed civilians			1
" it also casts doubts on @entity17 's claims that drone strikes produce zero to few civilian casualties and alleges that the @entity1 makes " efforts to shield the drone program from democratic accountability			1
" the drone strike program has long been controversial , with conflicting reports on its impact from @entity1 and @entity37 officials and independent organizations			0
president @entity39 told @entity40 last month that a target must meet " very tight and very strict standards , " and @entity43 , the president 's top counter-terrorism adviser , said in april that in " exceedingly rare " cases , civilians have been " accidentally injured , or worse , killed in these strikes			1
" in contrast to more conservative @entity1 statements , the @entity7 / @entity9 report -- titled " @entity50 " -- offers starker figures published by @entity54 , an independent organization based at @entity55 in @entity56			1
" @entity54 reports that from june 2004 through mid-september 2012 , available data indicate that drone strikes killed 2,562 - 3,325 people in @entity2 , of whom 474 - 881 were civilians , including 176 children			1
@entity54 reports that these strikes also injured an additional 1,228 - 1,362 individuals , " according to the @entity7 / @entity9 study			1
based on interviews with witnesses , victims and experts , the report accuses the @entity71 of " double - striking " a target , moments after the initial hit , thereby killing first responders			2
it also highlights harm " beyond death and physical injury , " publishing accounts of psychological trauma experienced by people living in @entity2 's tribal northwest region , who it says hear drones hover 24 hours a day			2
" before this we were all very happy , " the report quotes an anonymous resident as saying			0
" but after these drones attacks a lot of people are victims and have lost members of their family			0
a lot of them , they have mental illnesses			0
" people have to live with the fear that a strike could come down on them at any moment of the day or night , leaving behind dead whose " bodies are shattered to pieces , " and survivors who must be desperately sped to a hospital			0
the report concedes that " real threats to @entity1 security and to @entity37 civilians exist in the @entity37 border areas now targeted by drones			2
" and it acknowledges that drone strikes have " killed alleged combatants and disrupted armed actor networks			1
" but it concludes that drone strikes , which are conducted by the @entity71 in a country not at war with the @entity1 , are too harmful to civilians , too sloppy , legally questionable and do more harm to @entity1 interests than good			1
" a significant rethinking of current @entity1 targeted killing and drone strike policies is long overdue , " it says			0
" @entity1 policy - makers , and the @entity1 public , can not continue to ignore evidence of the civilian harm and counter-productive impacts of @entity1 targeted killings and drone strikes in @entity2			1
" the study recommends that @entity17 undertake measures to rectify collateral damage -- including making public detailed legal justification for strikes , implementing mechanisms transparently to account for civilian casualties , ensuring independent investigations into drone strike deaths , prosecuting cases of civilian casualties and compensating civilians harmed by @entity1 strikes in @entity2			1
nine months of research went into the report , according to its authors , which included " two investigations in @entity2 , more than 130 interviews with victims , witnesses , and experts , and review of thousands of pages of documentation and media reporting			2
" @entity1 authorities have largely kept quiet on the subject of drone strikes in @entity2			1
however , the use of armed drones to target and kill suspected terrorists has increased dramatically during the @entity39 administration , according to @entity173 , @entity40 's national security analyst and a director at the @entity175 , a @entity17 - based think tank that monitors drone strikes			1
@entity39 has already authorized 283 strikes in @entity2 , six times more than the number during president @entity180 's eight years in office , @entity173 wrote earlier this month			1
as a result , the number of estimated deaths from the @entity39 administration 's drone strikes is more than four times what it was during the @entity180 administration -- somewhere between 1,494 and 2,618			1
however , an analysis by the @entity175 says that the civilian casualty rate from drone strikes has been dropping sharply since 2008 despite the rising death toll			2
" the number of civilians plus those individuals whose precise status could not be determined from media reports -- labeled ' unknowns ' by @entity175 -- reported killed by drones in @entity2 during @entity39 's tenure in office were 11 % of fatalities , " said @entity173			1
" so far in 2012 it is close to 2 %			2
under president @entity180 it was 33 %			0
" the foundation 's analysis relies on credible media outlets in @entity2 , which in turn rely on @entity37 officials and local villagers ' accounts , @entity173 said , rather than on @entity1 figures			0
the drone program is deeply unpopular in @entity2 , where the national parliament voted in april to end any authorization for it			2
this , however , was " a vote that the @entity1 government has simply ignored , " according to @entity173			0
@entity39 told @entity40 's @entity221 this month that the use of armed drones was " something that you have to struggle with			2
" " if you do n't , then it 's very easy to slip into a situation in which you end up bending rules thinking that the ends always justify the means , " he continued			0
" that 's not been our tradition			0
that 's not who we are as a country			0
" @entity39 also addressed his criteria for lethal action in the interview , although he repeatedly declined to acknowledge any direct involvement in selecting targets			2
" it has to be a target that is authorized by our laws			0
it has to be a threat that is serious and not speculative			0
it has to be a situation in which we ca n't capture the individual before they move forward on some sort of operational plot against the @entity1 , " @entity39 said			0
his security adviser , @entity43 , gave the @entity39 administration 's first public justification for drone strikes in his april speech at the @entity259 , a @entity17 think - tank			1
such strikes are used when capture is not a feasible option and are conducted " in full accordance with the law , " @entity43 said			0
" we only authorize a strike if we have a high degree of confidence that innocent civilians will not be injured or killed , except in the rarest of circumstances , " he said			1
despite the " extraordinary precautions " taken by the @entity1 , @entity43 said , civilians " have been accidentally injured , or worse , killed in these strikes			2
it is exceedingly rare , but it has happened			0
when it does , it pains us , and we regret it deeply , as we do any time innocents are killed in war			0
" @entity43 also cited the " the seriousness , the extraordinary care " taken by @entity39 and his national security team in deciding whether to use lethal force			0
the @entity56 - based rights organization @entity286 , which with the help of a partner organization in @entity2 facilitated access to some of the people interviewed for the @entity7 / @entity9 study , backed its finding that the drone program causes wider damage than is acknowledged by the @entity1 government			1
" this shows that drone strikes go much further than simply killing innocent civilians			1
an entire region is being terrorized by the constant threat of death from the skies , " said @entity286 's director , @entity298			0
" their way of life is collapsing : kids are too terrified to go to school , adults are afraid to attend weddings , funerals , business meetings , or anything that involves gathering in groups			0
yet there is no end in sight , and nowhere the ordinary men , women and children of @entity2 can go to feel safe			0

a study by @entity7 and @entity9 claims only about 2 % of killed targets are " high - level "
innocent civilians are killed , *maimed* and traumatized by drone strikes , the report says
drones in @entity2 killed 176 children from 2004 to 2012 , an independent group says
@entity39 has said a target must meet " very tight and very strict standards "
