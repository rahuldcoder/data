-- @entity1 gather every day in airports , movie theaters , playgrounds , town halls , shopping centers , houses of worship , schools , ball parks and sporting arenas			0
unfortunately , these gatherings can be targets for acts of violence , particularly when they involve high - profile events			1
we are all safer when everyone is alert and engaged			0
and now the @entity19 is expanding its coordination -- with @entity21 , @entity22 , the @entity23 , the @entity24 and the @entity25 -- by releasing a new public service announcement today to tell their millions of fans : if you see something that does n't look right , report it to local authorities			1
in other words , " if you see something , say something			0
" the campaign supports the @entity19 belief that homeland security begins with hometown security			1
we work closely with state and local governments and law enforcement , the private sector , faith - based and community groups , and the public to reduce risks and make our communities safer			2
originally developed by the @entity51 , " if you see something , say something " is a simple and effective program to raise the public 's awareness of indicators of terrorism , and emphasize the importance of reporting suspicious activity to the proper authorities			1
this kind of reporting by citizens has helped foil numerous plots , including a planned attack against a martin luther king , jr. day parade route in @entity67 in 2010			2
and when a concerned gun store owner became suspicious of a customer 's purchases in @entity72 , @entity73 , last year , he called the authorities and helped prevent a likely attack at @entity76			2
@entity19 has expanded the program by partnering with cities , states , universities and private businesses , including the transportation , hospitality and retail sectors , to raise awareness for the " if you see something , @entity87 " campaign			1
in each sector , we have provided materials and collaborated on advertisements to help engage and educate the public as well as those working behind the scenes			0
the campaign has also forged a strong partnership with sports in every part of the country , including auto racing and college athletics			2
starting this fall , fans will see the new @entity105 in stadiums nationwide , urging them to say something if they see something			1
this could be an unattended bag or package ; a vehicle that seems out of place ; suspicious behavior or activity , like a person entering a restricted area that should not be there or leaving an item under a seat or behind a trash can			0
everyone has a role in keeping our communities safe			0
reports from individual citizens have helped save lives and avert potential catastrophes			0
when we each do our part , we keep our nation safe , one hometown at a time			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135			1
