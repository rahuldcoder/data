-- the @entity2 exception to the history of the @entity4 sheds new light on the relation between the @entity7 and the countries it occupied			1
it is of particular interest to compare the @entity2 , @entity12 and @entity13 experiences , because the three countries shared many similarities before the war and because the @entity7 leadership saw them through the same prism			2
despite this , the fate of the @entity20 in the three countries was very different			2
the armed resistance of @entity12 and the @entity13 led the @entity23 to take control not only of their territories but of their entire societies			0
high - ranking @entity28 officials were sent to oversee the administration of @entity12 and the @entity13 , and local @entity23 were installed in powerful positions throughout their civil administration			0
in sharp contrast , elected @entity2 politicians remained in control until the end of august 1943 and no @entity2 nazis were allowed to be part of the @entity2 administration			2
this made it possible for the @entity2 authorities to reject the rationale for any measure to be taken against the @entity2 jews			0
indeed , the @entity2 government insisted that no @entity20 problem existed in @entity2 and that therefore no solution was called for			1
this attitude provoked a surprising reaction on the part of the @entity7 leadership which not only hesitated and postponed the measures that were put in place elsewhere , but also softened the blow when finally , on october 1 , 1943 , the raid against the @entity2 @entity20 was executed			1
the @entity28 anticipated the popular @entity2 reaction in defense of their countrymen and sought to downplay the raid in order not to stir up too much trouble in the occupied country			2
the @entity2 opposition to the action caused the @entity23 to hesitate and at the same time stimulated a consideration in @entity66 of whether the action against the @entity2 @entity20 was worth the price ? the continuation of " @entity70 " with provisions of foodstuffs to @entity28 proved to be more important to the @entity7 leaders than deporting and killing the @entity2 jews			1
it is hard to conclude that something similar could have been achieved elsewhere under different conditions			0
but it is clear that the resistance of the @entity2 towards discrimination and persecution of their @entity20 countrymen made it possible for the @entity2 @entity20 to escape			1
this unique story begs the question whether the same would be true today ? would @entity2 -- or for that matter any other people -- in a comparable situation rise up and act spontaneously to rescue their countrymen , even at the risk of their own safety ? the question goes to the heart of one of the most intense discussions of modern democracies : who are " we " and who belongs to our society ? what does it take to be @entity101 -- or @entity2 , or for that matter @entity28 ? and who , living in @entity101 or in @entity2 , are not seen as part of the national " us " ? these questions find no easy answers			1
and yet , the history of the escape of the @entity2 @entity20 shows to us the critical importance of the answers			1
we have no reason to believe that @entity2 or other @entity114 would not today act on their own initiative to help their countrymen at peril			1
but it may be less obvious who would in that case be considered countrymen			0
whom do we see as part of society and thus under the protection of the communality ? and whom do we see as strangers living among us ? in the case of @entity2 in the 1940s , the inclusion not only related to the well - established @entity20 families who had been part of @entity2 society for centuries			1
it also included the more recently arrived " @entity135 " who were first generation immigrants , and , perhaps more surprisingly , the not insignificant number of stateless @entity20 , mostly @entity28 refugees on the run from @entity7 persecution			2
this group did not belong to @entity2 society in any trivial sense and they did not speak @entity2			2
most of them had been in the country only shortly , and many had no , if any , personal relation to @entity2			0
yet , they were rescued , because most @entity2 at the time saw the @entity7 assault against them as a violation of the sense of justice on which their nation was built			0
therefore , coming to their rescue was considered a national duty , an act of patriotism			0
the rationale was neither abstract nor sophisticated			0
it was a widely shared sense that an injustice was being committed and that letting it pass without attempting to stop it would eventually corrupt the entire society			0
this sense is what society is about , today just as much as at the time of the escape of the @entity2 jews			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

the @entity2 resisted persecution of their @entity20 countrymen , **writes** @entity172
he asks : would anyone rescue their countrymen today , even at the risk of their own safety ?
@entity172 says it begs the question : who are " we " and who belongs to our society ?
the escape of the @entity2 @entity20 shows to us the importance of the answers , he **writes**
