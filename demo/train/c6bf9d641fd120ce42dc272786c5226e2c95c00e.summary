-- if you 're a brown tree snake , those dead rodents that will soon be falling from the sky over @entity4 's @entity3 could be your last meal			1
that 's because the @entity9 @entity8 is planning to pack each one with acetaminophen , the generic equivalent of @entity12 , which can kill a snake in 72 hours			1
the drug - laced mice will be taped to pieces of cardboard , which in turn will be attached to streamers that will be dropped from helicopters over more than 100 acres of the @entity20 on the @entity22 island			1
the bombing campaign is expected to begin this spring , @entity24 , the @entity8 assistant operations director on @entity4 , told the local @entity25			2
it replicates a smaller - scale test drop tried on @entity4 in 2010 , he said			2
the goal , he said , is eradicating the brown tree snake from the island			1
the @entity32 says brown tree snakes have wiped out most of @entity4 's native populations of forest birds since being accidentally introduced to the island after @entity36 , probably after they stowed away on a ship or plane from their native range in @entity41 , @entity42 and the @entity43			1
the snakes , which can grow up to 8 feet long , also eat small mammals and lizards			2
the snake is mildly venomous , the @entity32 says , but it does not pose a danger to most adults , and its bite will not penetrate clothing			0
besides its effect on bird populations , the snakes also take an economic toll on @entity4 by causing numerous power outages each year when they cross from tree into electrical lines , the @entity32 says			1
there could be as many as 2 million of the snakes on @entity4 , where they have no natural predators			1
about 2,000 mice will be dropped in the newest test , the @entity63 reports			0
the $ 1 million program is being funded by the @entity67 , according to the report			0
" no one 's ever attempted anything on this scale , " @entity24 said of this spring 's planned air drop			0
" you know to date the largest plot that anyone 's been able to get rid of snakes is only a couple of acres			2
we 're talking 110 acres so this is completely novel			0
" the dead mice will target snakes in a fenced - in area of the base , he said , so officials will be able to determine the effectiveness in that area versus an adjacent area that the snakes could move in and out of			1
" we have a site where there 's a population of snakes that nobody can get into			2
it 's a controlled population , " @entity24 told the @entity25			0
" this is being done in a very rigorous , scientific manner			0
this is n't just something that we 've just kind of come up with by the seat of our pants			0
" and if the test works , more snakes could be confronting death from above			0
" we want to make sure we are doing it right			0
if the information shows that it 's effective in controlling the population , we will institute a plan to use it across areas in @entity4 , " @entity24 told the @entity63 .			1
