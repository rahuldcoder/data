@entity0 -- @entity2 voted to halt planned cuts in @entity5 payments to doctors tuesday , overriding president @entity8 's veto in a battle that pitted health insurers against physicians			1
president @entity8 says he objects to the bill because it takes choices " away from seniors to pay physicians			1
" the new law stops a 10.6 percent cut in @entity5 payments to doctors , part of a scheduled cost - saving formula that went into effect july 1			1
the money for the doctors will be taken from the government - subsidized @entity26 program , which the @entity8 administration strongly supports			1
@entity8 spiked the bill tuesday , telling lawmakers they would be " taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians			1
" " i urge the @entity2 to send me a bill that reduces the growth in @entity5 spending , increases competition and efficiency , implements principles of value - driven health care and appropriately offsets increases in physician spending , " he said in his veto message			1
the @entity45 voted 70 - 26 to enact the law over @entity8 's objections , the third time in his presidency that @entity2 has overridden his veto			1
the margin in the @entity52 was a lopsided 383 - 41 , well beyond the two - thirds majority needed			1
the @entity54 lobbied heavily for the bill , warning that its members could be forced to curtail seeing @entity5 patients if the cuts went into effect			1
but insurers , which receive government subsidies to offer @entity26 plans , warned that 2 million seniors could lose health benefits if it passed			0
a total of 21 @entity66 joined 47 democrats and two independents in the override vote			0
supporters broke a @entity72 - led filibuster of the bill last week , aided by the dramatic return of sen. @entity75 of @entity76			1
@entity75 's vote came in his first appearance on the @entity45 floor since surgery to remove a brain tumor in early june			1
though he did not vote tuesday , @entity75 praised his colleagues for overriding the " misguided " veto			0
" it 's a great vote , and a great day for @entity87 's seniors , " he said in a written statement			0
those @entity66 who opposed the bill argued that it would roll back many of the changes made to @entity5 in 2003 , when @entity2 created privately run , government - subsidized prescription drug coverage and expanded the role of private insurers in other coverage			1
" these are not pro-patient policies , " said sen. @entity95 , @entity96			0
" rather , the bill reduces access , benefits and choices for @entity5 beneficiaries			2
" but critics of the 2003 reforms say @entity26 subsidies end up costing more than the government would pay to cover the same people through regular @entity5 , the federal health insurance program for seniors			2
the @entity110 estimates that the bill will reduce federal spending by $ 12.5 billion by 2013 , largely by reducing @entity26 enrollment			0
sen. @entity114 , @entity115 , said the bill also made " vital improvements " by supporting rural health care and lowering fees for mental health care			0
" today , we can stand up for @entity5 , " she said			2
" we did it last week , when we came together and voted for this measure by a veto - proof margin , and i believe we can do it today by overriding that veto			2
" @entity2 had passed only two bills over @entity8 's objections : a $ 23 billion water - project legislation that the president vetoed in 2007 and a $ 300 billion farm bill he spiked in may			1
the @entity5 system pays for the health care of roughly 40 million elderly @entity87			2
rising health care costs have made @entity5 a growing part of the federal budget , and the stress on the system is increasing as more baby boomers reach retirement age			0
while the debate was raging over the bill , the @entity54 said the cuts could lead to a " meltdown " of the government 's health care system for the elderly			0
a recent survey by the group found that 60 percent of physicians will be forced to limit the number of new @entity5 patients they can take on if the cuts go into effect			2
" we stand at the brink of a @entity5 meltdown			0
... for doctors , this is not a partisan issue ; it 's a patient access issue , " @entity54 president @entity156 said in a statement after last week 's @entity45 vote			1
the @entity54 ran radio and tv ads over the @entity166 congressional recess targeting 10 @entity72 senators , seven of whom are up for re-election			0
the @entity171 , the nation 's largest organization of retired people , and other groups also are weighing in against the cuts			0
@entity177 , a family physician who practices in @entity178 , @entity179 , said the cuts could lead to doctors taking fewer @entity5 patients , making it difficult for the program 's elderly patients to get the care they need			1
" this @entity5 access problem is a real issue , not just a political football , " said @entity177 , who said 35 percent of his patients were eligible for @entity5			2
" it affects your dad when he 's sick			0
it affects my patients in my practice			0
this has to be addressed			0
" @entity1 's @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report .			0
