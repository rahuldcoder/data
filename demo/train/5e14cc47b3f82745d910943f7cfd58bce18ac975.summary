almost half of boys and one in five girls in @entity8 's capital city , @entity9 , believe that killing a woman who has " dishonored , " or shamed , her family is justifiable , a study of teenagers ' attitudes published thursday revealed			1
a third of all teenagers involved in the study by researchers at @entity17 's @entity16 advocated so - called honor murders			1
exclusive : how my brother tried to kill me in ' honor attack ' a key finding was that support for honor crimes was not connected to religious beliefs , but is far more likely in adolescent boys with low education backgrounds from traditional families			1
professor @entity30 and @entity16 graduate student @entity31 interviewed more than 850 teenagers , with an average age of 15 , for the study , published in the journal @entity35			2
disappearance , then discovery leads to ' honor killing ' outrage honor crimes can include physical assaults , rape , acid attacks and disfigurement , as well as murder			0
they can be triggered by a range of acts thought to bring shame on the family , from premarital sex to adultery to pregnancy outside marriage , or even contact by the woman with a man who is not a relation			0
the researchers say their study is one of the first to attempt to gauge cultural attitudes about honor murders in the region			1
it found that attitudes in support of honor murders " are anchored in a broader system of beliefs about patriarchal authority and dominance , and assumptions about female virginity and chastity			1
" this means that any attempt to change views would probably need to tackle the broader cultural support for patriarchal dominance , it said			0
' honor ' crime : why just kissing a boy can trigger murder in total , 33.4 % of all those surveyed either " agreed " or " strongly agreed " with situations depicting honor killings			2
boys were more than twice as likely to support honor killings : 46.1 % of boys and 22.1 % of girls agreed with at least two honor killing situations in the questionnaire			2
about six in 10 teenagers from the lowest level of educational background showed supportive attitudes towards honor killing , as opposed to about one in five where at least one family member has a university degree			0
teenagers who had a large number of siblings were more likely to condone honor killings than those from smaller families , the study found			1
belief blog : @entity111 does n't justify ' honor murders , ' experts insist " while we found the main demographic in support of @entity117 ( honor killing attitudes ) to be boys in traditional families with low levels of education , we noted substantial minorities of girls , well - educated and even irreligious teenagers who consider honor killing morally right , suggesting a persisting society - wide support for the tradition , " said @entity30			1
" any meaningful attempt to reduce attitudes in support of such practices requires a broader societal commitment , including coherent messages against honor - related violence from political and religious elites , and decisive action by the criminal justice system			2
" @entity8 has a long traditional of honor crimes , the researchers note , although it has taken steps in recent years to pass stricter laws against the practice			0
until 2001 , an article of the @entity8 @entity148 stated that a man who " catches his wife , or one of his female close relatives committing adultery with another , and he kills wounds or injures one or both of them , is exempt from any penalty			0
" in line with new legislation passed since then , a special court was set up in 2009 to prosecute honor crimes , the researchers say			0
but their study indicates attitudes are not necessarily changing in line with new legislation , even in a younger generation .			0
