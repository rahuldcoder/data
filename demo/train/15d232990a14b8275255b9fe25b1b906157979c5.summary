" when you look at ( @entity5 's ) comments , when you look at his comments about young black men in that neighborhood , about how they felt specially targeted by him , there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young @entity7 , " @entity75 president and ceo @entity82 said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity84			1
" what was the reaction around the country ? @entity2 did not cover that issue in his comments			0
