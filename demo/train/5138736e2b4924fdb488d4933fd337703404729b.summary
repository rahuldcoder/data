-- the third season premiere of a basic cable zombie drama just delivered a bigger rating in the adult demo than any entertainment series this fall — including all broadcast shows			1
sunday night 's third season premiere of " @entity8 " delivered a huge 10.9 million viewers for its first telecast			1
but what 's really impressive is the show 's adults 18 - 49 demo rating of a 5.8			2
the closest broadcast entertainment programs has gotten this fall to that number is @entity19 's " @entity20 " season premiere that pulled a 5.5 ( all these are apples - to - apples next - day ratings , not including @entity23 )			1
@entity24 has delivered bigger numbers , but that 's sports and we 're talking entertainment programming			0
and @entity29 accomplished this rating with an extra disadvantage — not having a major distributor , @entity32 , on board due to its carriage contract dispute ( imagine how many more viewers the episode might have had with @entity32 on board )			0
you know , aside from @entity29 's other major disadvantage being a pay cable network that 's only available to a fraction of @entity43 households compared to the @entity45 broadcasters			2
' snl ' : @entity46 hits right notes " @entity8 " was already the the most successful basic cable drama of all time in the adult demo			1
last night was up more than 50 percent from season two			1
and if you include " @entity8 's " encore telecast in the mix — which is a common habit for cable networks when touting their ratings — the total viewer number rises to 15.2 million			1
sure , it 's two airings , but still ... that 's edging into ncis territory			0
this has n't been a great fall for broadcast so far			0
three of the four major networks are down compared to last fall , with @entity68 — aided by " @entity69 " — rising somewhat			0
for a cable show to come along and prove that getting a huge rating in the valuable adult demo for a third - year show is still very possible must give pause			1
broadcasters , after all , turned down " @entity8			2
" as the show 's writer @entity76 told @entity0 : " there definitely was resistance to dive into the genre			0
[ network executives ] were like , ' i do n't know if we want dead people eating people on our network			0
" ' @entity8 ' revived ! @entity89 's take interestingly , the biggest new drama of the fall is @entity68 's " revolution , " which as i 've pointed out , plays a bit like " @entity8 " without zombies ( or people eating people )			2
last night 's premiere will probably be remembered as the hour that set a record for zombie killing			2
how many was that ? seventy ? eighty ? after last season 's fan complaint of too much farm chatting and not enough zombie killing , the third season premiere 's orgy of kill - shots surely satisfied fan blood lust ( though left me wanting an xbox controller in my hands )			1
