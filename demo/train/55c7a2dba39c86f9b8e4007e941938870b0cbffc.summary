@entity0 -- among the tens of thousands of people happily enduring the freezing temperatures in @entity0 's @entity4 is @entity5 , an international lawyer			1
he tells me he 's never protested before			1
" i 'm not a political person , " says @entity5 , who asked his full name not be used			2
" i 'm just a simple @entity9 citizen			2
" @entity5 says the day after @entity9 's parliamentary elections he asked his friends and colleagues who they voted for			1
" it was some kind of astonishment for me to understand how a party for whom nobody voted could win the elections , " he says			1
it was enough to inspire @entity5 to protest			1
his story is not unique			0
police estimate 25,000 people gathered in @entity0 ; protest organizers told the crowd they thought some 80,000 gathered			1
there are many in the crowd who until recently chose apathy over politics			0
but the elections on december 4 changed them			1
the protesters are demanding an annulment of the election results - which saw prime minister @entity37 's @entity14 party win 238 seats - and a new vote			1
writer @entity40 says it was the first time he voted			0
the experience transformed him into another first time protester			1
" i decided to try to influence the destiny of my country			0
i came to the polling station , i cast the ballot and it 's stolen , " @entity40 says			1
another man in the crowd , @entity48 , vents similar feelings			0
" i 'm a little bit angry because they told me , ' give us free time to hear our positions ' and so on			1
and then ' give us your free time to come and vote '			2
i see my country does not really need my vote , " @entity48 says			0
" so you want new elections			2
do you want anything else ? " i ask			0
" me personally ? no , " he replies			0
it 's another point often repeated by the protesters -- they do n't want a revolution			1
@entity65 and her friends laugh when i use the r - word			0
" we just want free elections			1
we do n't want revolution , " @entity65 says			1
" we just want our rights back and that 's all			2
" but the protest movement of this @entity9 winter does appear to have one thing in common with the @entity77			2
social networks played a vital role in mobilizing these educated , middle class people to stand in the snow and demand political change			0
" i think without the @entity84 , without @entity85 and without @entity9 parallel social network services , this would not have been possible , " @entity40 says			0
many in this crowd are politically inexperienced			0
none of them is naive			0
no one here believes this one gathering will convince prime minister @entity37 to annul the vote and hold new elections			1
but it has inspired hope and the protesters say that 's a profound change			2
" i feel one , a union , with all these people , " @entity65 says			0
" i believe we can do something			0
something really great that can change the whole political situation in @entity9			0

police estimate 25,000 gathered in @entity0 to protest recent election results
demonstrators *dispute* the *victory* of prime minister @entity37 's party
protester : ' we just want free elections . and that 's all . we do n't want revolution '
