-- @entity2 voters will go to the polls on april 5 in what could be one of the most significant presidential elections in the country 's turbulent history			1
the third election since the fall of the @entity12 in 2001 , it marks the first democratic handover of power in the fragile country , with incumbent @entity16 -- who is constitutionally bound to step down -- handing over the reins			1
with @entity21 troops scheduled to pull out of @entity2 by the end of the year , and following the refusal of @entity16 to sign a bilateral agreement -- the so - called @entity25 -- with the @entity26 to keep some troops in - country , @entity2 security is in the hands of the next man to be sworn in			1
@entity16 , once the darling of the @entity32 but long since fallen out of favor amid cries of corruption and cronyism , was widely credited with engineering the result last time out , but hopes are high that this election will yield a genuine result -- with the proviso that recent @entity12 - orchestrated violence does not disrupt polling			1
out of a field of eleven candidates , analysts believe there are three serious contenders , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
" @entity57 and @entity50 are campaigning on the implicit message that they will bring change , " @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity55 ) told @entity0 from @entity56			2
" @entity50 has long tried to be a leader of the opposition			2
@entity57 is going on the impression of being a highly educated man , very serious			2
so the two of them are trying to give this impression of change			0
@entity52 is presenting himself as the favored candidate of the president ... representing continuity			2
" if next sunday 's poll does n't produce a clear winner , the top two backed candidates will enter a runoff			1
however , a back - room deal may be struck to avoid this scenario , van @entity53 says , in order to avoid dragging on an election which is likely to be contentious			1
@entity0 takes a look at the three main contenders to be @entity2 's next leader			0
@entity50 an ophthalmologist and former @entity86 medic in a previous life , @entity50 was a vocal critic of the @entity12 during their years in power and although he was a previous @entity16 ally , serving in his government as foreign minister , he has in later years been a thorn in the side of the man who has ruled @entity2 since the fall of the @entity12 in 2001			1
this urbane politician , known for his eloquence -- and his elegance -- took on @entity16 in 2009 's election but dropped out after the first round in protest to what he saw as large - scale voter fraud			1
his campaign this time around has been wracked with violence , with three separate attacks by militants on @entity50 campaigners in the past few weeks. , according to the @entity2 news agency , @entity109			0
" the environment is not risk free , but when i look at the enthusiasm of the @entity2 people to participate in the elections -- that is part of it is encouraging			0
it is highly encouraging , " he told @entity0 's @entity117 earlier this year			0
as with many countries , both democratic and otherwise , loyalty along ethnic lines matters a great deal in @entity2			0
@entity123 make up more than half of the population in this multi-ethnic country , with @entity128 the second - largest group , and a number of minor @entity131 and other ethnic groups			1
@entity132 and part @entity123 , @entity50 is considered a relative outsider given his background			0
he is generally associated with his @entity137 side , giving him a possible advantage in reaching out to @entity141 voters , but which may work against him if he is forced into a runoff and the other candidates back his @entity123 challenger			1
he is seen as a relatively liberal candidate and advocate of women 's engagement in public life , telling @entity151 's independent newspaper , " if you want to see this country or any other country even being able to deal with the challenges and develop , it can not happen without the role of half the population			1
" he has signaled his intention to sign the @entity25 with president @entity159 in an effort to offer his constituents some security following @entity21 '' s planned withdrawal at the end of 2014			0
@entity52 while @entity16 has said that he will not publicly throw his weight behind any of the 11 candidates running , @entity52 is seen as the establishment candidate			1
a @entity16 ally , he received the backing of the current president 's brother , @entity170 , who withdrew his candidacy and endorsed the former foreign minister			1
" he has n't been formally endorsed ( by the president ) but the impression has been allowed to persist , " says van @entity53			0
on wednesday another hopeful , @entity177 , also stepped down and backed @entity52 , giving him further momentum in the run - up to next week 's vote			2
another doctor , the former @entity16 cabinet minister has a reputation for honesty , despite his years in an administration widely plagued with accusations of graft			1
he has said that he will abide by the results of the april 5 poll , even if he suspects fraud , and has urged his fellow challengers to do the same			1
there have been doubts aired of the government 's impartiality and rival candidates have expressed fears that his connections in the presidential palace could be the invisible hand that nudges him to victory			1
a moderate , he has urged better relations with the war - torn country 's neighbors , and has also followed his fellow candidates ' lead by pledging to sign the joint security agreement with the @entity26 his running mate , @entity209 , is one of only three female vice-presidential candidates on the ballot			1
@entity212 says that this may be a calculated move			0
" when you 're putting together your ticket you try to appeal to as many people as possible , this is also an attempt to reach out to the women voters			0
" @entity57 a former academic who previously taught at @entity221 and @entity222 in the @entity26 , @entity51 has emerged as a dark horse who recently polled as a potential leading candidate			2
a former @entity26 citizen who gave up his passport to run for the @entity2 presidency in 2009 , he 's known as having an impatient , fiery temper but also of being incredibly detail - oriented			2
another @entity231 man , @entity57 served as both an adviser to the current president and also as finance minister in his cabinet			0
he was working at the @entity236 in @entity237 during the september 11 attacks , and used the tragedy as a springboard for his re-engagement in @entity2 politics , returning to his home country just months after the event			1
considered a moderate , he says he has seen positive signs while campaigning around the country			2
" ( at ) rally after rally people are responding to a message of moderation , to message of reform , to message of transformation , to peace , stability and cooperation , " he told @entity0 's @entity247			0
watch : @entity0 's @entity117 interviews @entity57 his experience in the development agency was invaluable during his time in @entity16 's government , reconstructing the country , and he hopes voters will be convinced that it will stand him in equally good stead for the top job			1
a shrewd operator , @entity57 has enlisted the support of ex-warlord general @entity271 , a native @entity272 , as his running mate			0
with this choice , van @entity53 says , " he 'll appeal to the @entity272 vote			0
the ethnic groups are not solid block , s but the @entity272 one is probably the most solid one			0
it also shows us that he 's prepared to play politics , he 's not only principled , which goes both ways			0
for some people that 's a plus and for others it is n't			0
" however , his many years in the @entity26 -- especially while his countrymen were suffering , first under the yoke of @entity293 imperialism and later the strictures of the @entity12 -- may impede him as he is seen as an outsider with strong ties to the @entity26 , merely the latest foreign invaders of @entity2 soil			0
long memories as with 2009 , voters ' hopes are tinged with skepticism going into saturday 's vote			0
" people ( remember ) the last election , " van @entity53 says			2
" they know there 's been a lot of manipulation , a lot of irregularities			0
they hope it will be better but most people are fairly realistic			2

historic presidential election looms for war - torn country
april 5 will see the first round of voting , with a following runoff if no candidate wins *outright*
out of a field of 11 , three candidates stand a realistic chance of winning
