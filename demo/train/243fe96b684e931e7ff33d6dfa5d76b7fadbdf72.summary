-- @entity2 giants @entity3 and @entity4 were both held in @entity5 as they battled to unconvincing draws			1
@entity4 failed to score for a second consecutive game as they were held 0 - 0 by @entity7			1
coach @entity8 could do little to inject some life into his team as they struggled to break down a spirited @entity7 defense			2
in fact it was racing who could have taken the lead after @entity17 's superb strike was only kept out by a stunning finger - tip save by goalkeeper @entity19			0
the draw followed @entity4 's 1 - 0 defeat to @entity22 and leaves them seventh in the league			1
" this was a different match to that against @entity22 as here it felt as though there was only one side looking to win the game , " @entity8 told @entity25			0
" it is a worrying situation as we have now lost five points from two games away from home			0
it would be wrong to say one player has n't scored or another one has failed but as a team we were n't at our best although we tried			0
" meanwhile @entity3 were lucky to grab a 2 - 2 draw with @entity43 , @entity5 's early , surprise pace - setters			1
in a chaotic 11 first half minutes @entity45 gifted @entity43 the lead when he deflected a low cross from the left into his own net			2
@entity49 soon equalized for @entity3 but a few moments later @entity50 tapped in to restore @entity43 's well - deserved advantage			1
but the match turned on what may well be the miss of the season when @entity57 , totally unmarked and in the middle of an empty net , somehow slid in and diverted the ball past the left hand post			0
in the second half @entity3 probed in their typically patient fashion before @entity64 scored his fourth goal of the season			2
the match finished 2 - 2			1
elsewhere @entity67 won 4 - 0 win against @entity69			1
big money summer signing @entity70 scored twice , taking his tally to five goals in two games			0
@entity76 - owned @entity75 beat @entity77 1 - 0 whilst @entity22 followed their impressive victory over @entity4 with all three points against @entity80 , beating them 2 - 1			1
in @entity82 @entity81 needed a 63rd minute goal from teenage substitute @entity84 to earn a 1 - 1 draw against @entity86			1
the result means that both @entity81 clubs have yet to record a win this season			2
tuesday night saw @entity91 lose 3 - 1 to newly - promoted @entity92 and coach @entity93 lose his job			0
but @entity81 coach @entity95 insisted that he was happy with his team 's performance			2
" we played well right up until the end and only risked conceding on the counter , " he told @entity25			0
" it 's normal that it 's not nice looking at the table but the important thing is how you play			0
i 'm happy because the lads played well and took risks by trying to score			0
" @entity108 currently lead @entity109 on goals scored after beating @entity111 3 - 0 .			1
