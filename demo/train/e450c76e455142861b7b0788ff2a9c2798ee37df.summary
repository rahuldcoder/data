-- the crackdown on protesters after the police shot and killed @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , highlighted that more and more , police departments possess sophisticated weapons and equipment originally designed for the battlefield			1
federal anti-terrorism funding is a major driver of this trend , but once police departments have this equipment they use it -- even if it 's not against terrorists			1
what few people understand is that police increasingly make use of sophisticated surveillance equipment as well			1
@entity23 - style mass surveillance technologies are making it possible for local police departments to gather information on each and every one of us , on a scale never before been possible			1
one key area in which the government is amassing large pools of data is location tracking , particularly of automobiles			1
you might think that location data is n't sensitive			1
after all , when you 're out in public other people can see you			0
but that 's not the right way to think about it			0
most ca n't go to a therapist , a church , a gun range , a bar , or a casino without driving			0
and when all of that information about where we go is amassed into a large database stored by a government agency and held for months , or years , that 's a sensitive collection of information			1
history has shown that once the government has access to massive pools of data , it 's just a matter of time before it 's abused -- for political retribution , or even simple voyeurism			1
an important driver of this trend toward mass surveillance of @entity40 ' movements is the automatic license plate reader			1
they sound innocuous -- and if they were used in a limited and appropriate manner , they would be innocuous			0
these devices snap a photo of every passing license plate			0
if all the police did was check the captured plates against lists of cars associated with people wanted for crimes , there would be no problem			2
but in the era of cheap data storage , police are increasingly using the technology to amass vast pools of data tracking where people have been over time — and hanging onto it for months or even years			1
the question is not whether law enforcement agents should be permitted to use license plate readers : the question is how they should be permitted to use them			0
you can agree that license plate readers are useful for identifying wanted criminals who are driving around , but disagree that the government should amass vast pools of data about everyone , given that most of us are not criminals			2
this technology can be abused -- and it has been abused			0
in @entity110 , police in cars equipped with plate readers drove by mosques to record each attendee -- a major burden on the freedom of religion that many of us hold dear			2
in the @entity119 , the police put the plate number of activist @entity121 , in his late 80s , on a hot list because he 'd attended a large number of lawful protests			0
( he was known to sketch the protesters			0
) federal funds are being spent to push this equipment out across the country , a process that often bypasses the role that traditional elected representatives once played because the police no longer need funds from the city council			2
and the technology is more powerful year over year as the cost of computer processing plummets and storing data becomes a trivial matter			0
police departments once asked themselves : why keep this data ? but now data storage is so cheap that they ask : why not keep it ? one of the most pernicious aspects of how police departments have adopted surveillance technologies — which is really deciding how much privacy people should enjoy — has been the lack of public debate or even knowledge that these technologies are being adopted			1
because police departments can get funding from the federal government , often there is no need to involve local legislative bodies , let alone the public , in the process			1
sometimes this lack of notice has led to a backlash			0
in @entity166 , the mayor instructed the police department to terminate its drone program and return the drones to the vendor after the public learned that the drones had been acquired			2
the public wants in on the debate about surveillance — and democratic values suggest that we ought to have this opportunity			2
but in the main , we know far too little about which cities and towns around the country are using powerful surveillance technologies			0
the time to fix this is now .			0

@entity188 : @entity40 police getting surveillance equipment and anti-terror weapons
@entity188 : government amasses data by location tracking , especially of cars
@entity188 : it 's as if a *cop* with *perfect* memory was following you wherever you go
she says the public should know about *monitoring* and it should be justified
