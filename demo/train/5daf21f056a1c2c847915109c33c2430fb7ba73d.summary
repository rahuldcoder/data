-- like many schools in heavily urban areas , there are metal detectors , the neighborhood is poorer than many and 90 % of the students qualify for free or subsidized lunches			1
but there 's a real difference at @entity11 in the @entity13 neighborhood of @entity14			1
at this school , 95 % of the students are routinely accepted into college			1
headmaster @entity18 has overseen this pilot model public school since it opened in 2002 as a partnership between the public school system , private business and philanthropists			2
" it 's a total team effort , " @entity18 told @entity0			2
" it starts with having quality teachers who are committed and hard - working			0
" and those metal detectors , @entity18 sees them as a symbol and a metaphor			0
they " keep the street in the street and the school in the school , " she said			2
the simple act of walking through the metal detectors each day helps students " forget all that outside stuff for that moment of time			0
" " when you 're in here , you 're here to succeed			0
" and success has come to this small experimental school			0
president @entity48 along with @entity49 , co-chair of the @entity51 , and education secretary @entity52 will tour @entity11 on tuesday			1
the president will showcase the school 's success story and discuss the shared responsibility of investing in education to win the future			1
" there is no better economic policy than one that produces more graduates , " @entity48 says in prepared remarks for a speech he will give to @entity11 students and teachers			1
" that 's why reforming education is the responsibility of every @entity68 -- every parent , every teacher , every business leader , every public official , and every student			1
" @entity11 opened with 75 students and a $ 400,000 grant from the @entity51 , as well as support from other private and philanthropic organizations			1
today enrollment is more than 800 students in 6th through 12th grades			0
its mission is to better educate kids using technology as an integral part of that education			1
every student enrolling at @entity11 receives his or her own laptop			1
forget chalkboards , each classroom has its own @entity93 board , a high tech , interactive white board			0
technology giants like @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 are benefactors			0
but @entity18 , the headmaster , insists the success of the partnership is a result of much more than material donations			0
" it 's more than pulling up trucks and dropping things off , " according to @entity18 , who says it 's the continuing relationship the companies pursue with the school that makes the difference			2
for instance , @entity93 boards are excellent tools in the classroom , but when companies work to develop teachers ' skills in learning new and different ways to use those boards , it makes the technology all the more enriching			0
another way the corporate partners help students is by opening job - shadow opportunities to them			0
" they go out and see what 's possible with a degree ... what doors will open for me , " according to @entity18 , who says putting her students in the workplace alongside engineers , scientists or technicians -- many of whom come from similar impoverished backgrounds -- is invaluable			2
eighty to 90 % of @entity11 's students are first - generation college applicants			1
the @entity145 will announce a new program on tuesday with $ 90 million in competitive grants for educators who create dramatic breakthroughs using technology for teaching and learning			1
@entity52 said in a conference call with reporters on monday that the program is part of a larger plan to remake the @entity157 into a " department with a laser - like focus on innovation			2
" " technology has transformed how folks do business			0
it 's transformed how folks interact socially , " said @entity52			1
" it 's led to literally , you know , huge , revolutionary changes in places like @entity169			0
but technology frankly has n't had that kind of impact on the education space yet			2
" " we want to invest in that next generation of tools that could help us get the much better student outcomes for ideally a fraction of the time and a fraction of the cost , " @entity52 added			1
at @entity11 , that vision has become reality , and @entity18 sees the cycle of failure breaking			2
former students are now back at the school -- this time as teaching aides -- as they pursue their education degrees			1
the headmaster proudly confided that she asked them why they had chosen teaching			0
" they told me , ' because education changed my life , ' " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity198 contributed to this report			0

the @entity145 will *unveil* grants for teaching breakthroughs involving technology
80 % to 90 % of @entity11 's students are first generation college applicants
president @entity48 and education secretary @entity52 will be at the school
