@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 has punished @entity4 midfielder @entity3 with a six - match @entity6 ban following his horror tackle on @entity10 's @entity9 last week			1
@entity3 , right , lunges towards @entity10 midfielder @entity9 during @entity4 's 1 - 0 defeat in @entity12			1
the @entity13 international was sent off for the challenge in his side 's 1 - 0 defeat in the @entity19 match in @entity12 last wednesday			1
@entity20 international @entity9 avoided injury , but claimed @entity3 had tried to break his leg with the tackle in the 85th minute -- and demanded that @entity2 's governing body take further action			1
@entity3 , 24 , apologized for the challenge -- described by officiating referee @entity27 of @entity28 as one of the worst he had ever seen -- on the day after the match			0
but @entity2 's control and disciplinary body announced their sanction on friday morning , having deliberated on the case on thursday			0
in a statement on uefa.com , @entity3 's challenge was described as one which " seriously endangered the physical health of the opposing player "			0
@entity4 can appeal against the ban , which rules @entity3 out of the @entity44 club 's remaining @entity45 matches against @entity46 and @entity47			2
if unsuccessful , he will also miss any matches in the knockout stages of the @entity19 or @entity50			0

" it is the second time that @entity2 has had to intervene following an incident involving @entity10 this season			2
