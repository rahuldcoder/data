he 's an 82 - year - old " redneck hillbilly from west @entity1 " who 's been scratching an itch to go fast his whole life			2
finally , after decades of racing high - performance speed boats and winning world - class endurance car competitions , @entity5 got his hands on the fastest executive jet on the planet : the @entity12			1
@entity13 caught up with @entity5 by cell phone between practice laps at @entity16			2
" as long as the cars here do n't crank up , we can talk ! " he said			2
from then on , @entity20 -- @entity22 's flea market kingpin -- sounded like a giddy schoolboy as he told his story about how he put down a $ 1 million deposit in april 2012 to become the first person to buy a @entity12 -- " the hottest airplane out there " --- with its distinctive , sweeping , curving wings and its roomy , swanky interior			1
it made him " feel like a million dollars , " he said gleefully			1
for a plane that costs $ 65 million , feeling like $ 1 million might seem like a disappointment			1
but you get the picture			2
the jet 's top speed : 704 mph -- nearly the speed of sound -- makes it arguably the world 's fastest civilian aircraft			2
" i was just amazed at how quick it took off , " says @entity5			2
" and then it just went zoom -- straight up			2
i just sat back and drank a glass of wine and enjoyed it			2
he 's been around the track a time or two -- winning the checkered flag during the ' 80s at the @entity53 and the 12 hours event at @entity22 's @entity55			2
he does n't compete anymore			2
but he still travels around the world to race his friends			2
a super-fast @entity12 that can fly 8,000 statute miles -- farther than just about any other executive class jet -- might save him a lot of time and hassles			1
saving time and avoiding hassles are the main reasons the rich and famous want to fly private			1
@entity66 and @entity67 reportedly each own a @entity68			1
@entity69 is said to have a @entity71 iv. @entity72 has an @entity73 650			0
and @entity74 reportedly received a @entity75 from his wife , @entity76 , as a @entity78 gift			1
but none of these planes can smoke the @entity12			1
speed aside , it 's got goodies like no other jet in its class			0
in the cockpit : an infrared night - vision system projects a pilot windshield display , increasing safety during landings			0
in the cabin : bigger 28 - inch - tall windows and a ceiling height of 6 - and - a - half feet			0
" if you fly from here to @entity94 , you have to fly with two crews , " @entity5 explains			0
the @entity12 has " a complete crew quarters and restrooms and galley and everything they need			1
so it 's a different breed of cat from what i 'm used to			0
" speed flows through @entity5 's family bloodline , dating back to his boyhood in @entity107			0
his father raced speed boats and cars when he was n't running movie theaters			0
as an adult in 1963 , @entity5 bought a drive - in theater of his own in @entity115 , @entity22			0
during the next half - century , that drive - in grew into the @entity117 -- an 88 - acre flea market and cash cow			0
of course , @entity5 's not the lone lover of the @entity12			1
reportedly , the plane has caught @entity66 's eye as well			1
also said to be interested are @entity124 media mogul @entity123 , designer @entity125 and financial wizard @entity126			1
keep in mind that " very few celebrities own their own jets , " says @entity130 of @entity131			0
owning a plane is still expensive , even if you 're rich			1
@entity130 says most celebs fly private by using brokers or buying memberships in fractional share programs			1
brokers @entity142 - based @entity141 brokers private jets -- hooking planes up with passengers for a one - time , up - front price			1
" private aviation is becoming more commonplace because there are more programs now , " says @entity141 ceo @entity146 , a 23 - year top broker whose business includes several college and professional sports teams			1
" thanks to the @entity154 , there are now 500 companies that can arrange something for you			0
" typically , an aircraft that can fly about 10 passengers round trip from @entity161 to @entity162 could cost about $ 54,000			1
a smaller jet that seats about seven might cost $ 26,000 round trip from @entity166 to @entity167 , @entity168			1
split the cost among the passengers , and it 's comparable to the price of some luxury cruises -- and a possible option to celebrate an important life - event such as a golden anniversary or a retirement party			0
fractional shares fractional share programs such as @entity180 have been around for a while , offering travelers the less expensive option of buying shares of a jet instead of buying the whole thing			0
share programs often come with " jet cards			0
" prepay tens of thousands of dollars onto your card in exchange for the convenience of dialing an 800 number and ordering a jet			0
" that was a real industry game - changer , " says @entity146			0
" it made booking a jet as easy as ordering a pizza			0
" one downside , says @entity146 : you have to pay well in advance			0
many jet cards start at a minimum of $ 100,000 , but @entity205 offers a more affordable $ 25,000 card			1
give them at least 48 hours notice , and they 'll get you a plane , says @entity205 president @entity211			1
one upside , says @entity211 : you 're protected against rising prices			0
" people can lock in today 's rate even if there are future increases , " @entity211 says			0
" with the cost of @entity221 fuel approaching $ 6 a gallon and a burn rate approaching -- depending on the plane type -- 200 gallons an hour , that gets pretty costly			1
" @entity205 charges about $ 5,000 per hour for jets seating up to eight people			1
rates start at $ 9,800 per hour for jets seating up to 14 people			1
@entity231 offers an even more creative idea : " semi-private " flying , @entity230 reports			2
@entity231 books business class planes from carriers such as @entity237 and sells the seats individually			0
a @entity231 seat on a challenger 300 from @entity161 to @entity162 might cost around $ 3,500			2
@entity230 : @entity231 offers private jet seats for less development of the @entity12 survived a crisis in 2011 , when one of the jets crashed during a takeoff performance test in @entity247 , killing two @entity71 pilots and two flight test engineers			1
federal investigators blamed @entity71 's testing process			0
during the investigation , @entity71 temporarily shut down its @entity12 test planes			1
but 17 months later , the @entity12 received @entity255 certification			1
now , @entity71 has more than 200 customers waiting to get their hands on a @entity12			1
so far , only about a half dozen have been delivered to customers			0
as they roll out , plane spotters are on site , snapping photos and posting them online			2
" if you call @entity71 and ask , ' when can i get a @entity12 ? ' it 's four or five years off , " says @entity5			1
unfortunately for @entity5 , enjoying his @entity12 wo n't be an option for the time being			1
ultimately , he says , he 's a businessman , and the plane is an investment			2
he leased the jet back to @entity71 so the company can use it as a demonstration model			0
" it 's on its way to @entity274 , " @entity5 says			0
" it 's supposedly going to set a round - the - world record			0
" there 's a hint of disappointment in @entity5 's voice , above the sounds of revving engines at the @entity16 track			0
" sorry , it 's time to get back to it , " he explains			0
" i 'm going to take my @entity286 back out on the track , and then i 'm finished for today , " he says			0
" then i 'm going back to work			0
