@entity0 -- get real , defense secretary @entity2 told @entity3 on monday in proposing a scaled back , modern military that would cut the @entity5 to its lowest troop level since before @entity7 , retire the a- 10 " warthog " attack jet and reduce some benefits for fighting forces			1
" this is a budget that recognizes the reality of the magnitude of our fiscal challenges , the dangerous world we live in , and the @entity3 military 's unique and indispensable role in the security of this country and in today 's volatile world , " @entity11 said in unveiling the @entity13 spending plan for 2015 and beyond			1
" there are difficult decisions ahead , " he added			0
" that is the reality we 're living with			0
" downsizing due to modernization and budget constraints began under @entity11 's predecessor , @entity34 , and the proposal outlined on monday described a new phase in the transition			1
" not a war - footing budget " " for the first time in 13 years we will be presenting a budget to the @entity45 that 's not a war - footing budget , " @entity11 said in response to reporters ' questions			1
" that 's a defining budget because it starts to reset and reshape			2
" under it , the former senator from @entity50 said the military would become a smaller , more tactical force capable of fighting on one war front and maintaining effective defenses for a second while shifting to more specialized capabilities			2
" our analysis showed that this force would be capable of decisively defeating aggression in one major combat theater -- as it must be -- while also defending the homeland and supporting air and naval forces engaged in another theater against an adversary , " he said			0
the proposal endorsed monday by @entity68 chairman gen. @entity69 , who appeared with @entity11 at the @entity13 news conference , is certain to face strong opposition in @entity45 -- especially with midterm elections coming up in november			2
@entity11 's budget will be formally proposed next week and legislators from states or districts with major military bases or a heavy presence of contractors are expected to rail against it			1
in recent years , @entity83 hawks have battled military force reductions under president @entity86 's attempts to reduce defense spending as part of overall deficit reduction			1
conservative sen. @entity90 of @entity91 , a possible @entity83 presidential contender in 2016 , questioned the planned cuts in forces at a time of varying threats and a @entity3 shift in emphasis to the @entity98 , saying it " does not make strategic sense			1
" " it 's going to be a far slimmer military , " noted @entity101 and retired maj. gen. @entity102 , predicting a rough reception in @entity0			1
" this is the toughest part -- the political part			0
" retired @entity108 commander : it 's necessary retired army gen. @entity110 , a former @entity108 supreme allied commander in @entity111 , said he thought the changes were necessary			2
" whether it 's smart or not is yet to be seen			0
but i think it 's necessary to do , given the constraints that we face fiscally within the @entity3 , " he told @entity1			0
for now , the @entity13 budget for the rest of this fiscal year and for 2015 is about $ 500 billion for each , as set by a congressional compromise in december			0
@entity11 acknowledged the changes he proposed mean assuming more risk , but said the military would be better situated to respond to the evolving security challenges facing the country			1
the recommendations in the budget plan for 2015 and ensuing years " favor a smaller and more capable force -- putting a premium on rapidly deployable , self - sustaining platforms that can defeat more technologically advanced adversaries , " @entity11 said			1
he added that the proposal includes " important investments to preserve a safe , secure , reliable , and effective nuclear force			0
" all military forces , both active and reserve , would be cut under the budget plan			2
it calls for reducing the @entity5 to a level of 440,000 to 450,000 troops , which would be the lowest total in more than 70 years			1
at its height , the @entity5 had 570,000 troops after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , and currently has about 520,000			2
according to @entity11 , the budget proposal protects funding for cyberwarfare and special operations , and preserves money for the controversial and costly @entity154 fighter jet			1
warthogs retired ? his plan would retire the @entity158 , which @entity11 called a 40 - year - old , single - purpose aircraft designed for @entity161 operations , at a cost savings of $ 3.5 billion over five years			1
separately , @entity11 said 900 additional @entity163 would be assigned to bolster security at embassies around the world under his proposal			0
diplomatic security has received close scrutiny since a terror attack on the @entity3 consulate in @entity173 , @entity174 , in 2012 killed ambassador @entity175 and three other @entity3			0
also , @entity11 said the plan envisions increasing special operations forces from 66,000 today to 69,700 in the future to better meet tactical needs of a modern military requiring counterterrorism and crisis response			1
other provisions would reduce some benefits for military personnel , resulting in them having to shoulder more of their housing and medical costs			0
reducing the federal subsidy to commissaries would mean smaller discounts for groceries on @entity3 bases			0
through his remarks , @entity11 warned that if @entity45 fails to eliminate planned across - the - board spending cuts beyond 2016 , the military reductions would be on a greater scale and significant enough to compromise @entity3 national security			2
some of those forced cuts , known as sequestration , were eased for this year and next under the budget deal worked out by @entity45 in december			0
@entity1 's @entity204 and @entity206 's @entity205 contributed to this report .			0
