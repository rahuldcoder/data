@entity0 -- in most of @entity3 , it 's still legal to possess child pornography			1
although production and distribution have been banned for 15 years , @entity3 lags behind other major developed nations in forbidding people from simply holding the sinister material			1
that is about to change in a country regarded as a global nexus of child pornography			1
the country 's upper house of parliament is expected to pass legislation this month making possession of it a crime punishable by up to a year in prison			1
children 's rights activists have applauded the step , although their reaction is tempered with frustration that it has taken such a long time			0
" as a member of a group that 's been hearing the voice of the victims for many years , we welcome the news , " said @entity25 , a representative of @entity26 , a nonprofit group that helps exploited children			0
" @entity3 took so long , and it is too late to reach this decision as a developed country			1
" the proposed law , which was already approved by the lower house of parliament this week , comes with a couple of noteworthy loopholes			2
when it goes into effect , it will give those already in possession of child pornography a year to dispose of it			1
and it wo n't cover the country 's popular manga ( comic book ) and anime ( animation ) industries , which include depictions of violent sexual abuse of children in their publications			1
@entity25 said a discussion about some of the imagery in manga and anime -- content that would be illegal in many @entity66 countries -- would be a natural " next step			0
" ' a necessary evil ' but representatives of those industries say that while they support the ban on real child pornography , any move to censor their products would be an unjustified restriction of freedom of expression			1
@entity78 , a lawyer and inspector for the @entity80 , said it was " natural that animation is exempted			0
" " the goal of the law itself is to protect children from crime , " he said			2
" @entity88 such expression in animation under this law would not satisfy the goal of the law			2
" @entity78 said that no studies have been done that prove any link between pedophilia and animation in @entity3			2
@entity98 , the manager of @entity99 , one of the country 's best known manga production houses , said that more could be done in terms of age restrictions on graphic content featuring children and to distinguish it more clearly from other comics			2
and he admitted that some products of the industry leave him and his colleagues " disgusted			2
" " but rich , deep culture is born from something that might not be accepted by all , " @entity98 said			0
" we need to allow the gray zone to exist as a necessary evil			0
" ' an international hub ' some experts counter that children suffer in a culture that appears to tolerate images of child sexual abuse			1
@entity124 , a public affairs officer for @entity125 in @entity3 , pointed to the graphic content in manga , anime and some video games , as well as the " junior idol " genre of books and dvds that display minors wearing tiny bikinis and striking sexual poses			1
@entity3 should do more -- beyond the proposed law change -- " to protect the best interest of children , " @entity124 said			1
statistics show that child pornography remains a big problem in @entity3			1
the @entity143 's 2013 report on human rights practices in @entity3 labels the country " an international hub for the production and trafficking of child pornography			1
" it cited @entity3 police data showing the number of child pornography investigations in 2012 rose 9.7 % from a year earlier to a record of 1,596			1
the cases involved 1,264 child victims , almost twice as many as in the previous year			0
the fact that possession remains legal , for the time being , " continued to hamper police efforts to enforce the law effectively and participate fully in international law enforcement , " the report said			1
girls as sex objects one local authority already took matters into its own hands			0
the prefecture of @entity169 in central @entity3 introduced a ban on possession of child pornography in 2011			1
but @entity124 said addressing the problems is n't just a matter for government , suggesting parents , the media , the private sector and even children themselves can play a role in improving the situation			0
the portrayal of young girls as sex objects in @entity3 has long raised eyebrows among @entity186			2
an article in @entity188 in 1999 reeled off a list of examples in @entity0 : " vending machines sell schoolgirls ' used panties , which the girls sell to middlemen			0
' image bars ' specialize in escorts dressed in school uniforms			0
telephone clubs feature bored adolescent girls earning spending money by talking dirty			0
sex shops sell a porn magazine called ' @entity204			0
' " some experts suggest the situation is born out of @entity3 's long - established patriarchal society			2
whatever the cause , changing a culture may prove a lot harder than changing a law			0
@entity1 's @entity212 reported from @entity0 , and @entity213 reported and wrote from @entity214			0
@entity1 's @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
