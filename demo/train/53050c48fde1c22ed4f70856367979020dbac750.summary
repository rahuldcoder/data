@entity1 here is a look at some of the strongest potential contenders to replace @entity7 sen. @entity6 , who announced this week that she will not run for re-election in 2016			1
@entity6 and sen. @entity9 have held the state 's two @entity11 seats for more than two decades , setting up a potentially wild scramble for @entity6 's seat			1
@entity7 's @entity15 has been decimated in recent years -- with no obvious @entity15 candidate emerging			1
but the state 's top - two primary system could well lead to a @entity19 vs. @entity19 runoff in november of 2016			1
@entity21 @entity21 , a former @entity22 district attorney , replaced then - attorney gen. @entity23 in 2010 , filling a job that is one of the best stepping stones to higher office in this state			1
in that post , she continued her longtime focus on reducing recidivism and truancy , and won accolades for vigorously pursuing banks accused of foreclosing properties on homeowners without following procedures			2
at the same time , critics have said she has been too cautious in taking positions on controversial issues like the legalization of marijuana			2
the daughter of a @entity46 - @entity45 father and an @entity48 - @entity45 mother , @entity42 has gained national notice and enjoyed a strong friendship with president @entity51 , who could help her raise money for a bid			1
at a 2013 fundraiser , @entity51 called her " brilliant , " " dedicated " and " tough " before joking that she was " by far the best - looking attorney general in the country			1
" ( he later apologized , and she expressed her strong support for him through a spokesman )			1
@entity6 's retirement sets off wild scramble during her six years as @entity22 's district attorney , @entity42 faced criticism because of her opposition to capital punishment			2
she infuriated many police officers when she refused to pursue the death penalty in 2004 for the suspect who gunned down officer @entity69 with an @entity70			0
but when she ran for attorney general , she said she would enforce the state 's law			0
she followed through last year when she announced that she would challenge a federal judge 's decision declaring @entity7 's death penalty unconstitutional			1
@entity77 lt. gov. @entity77 is best known for touching off a national firestorm in 2004 by issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples as mayor of @entity22			2
denying gay men and women that right , he told @entity2 in 2004 , was " wrong and inconsistent with the values this country holds dear			0
" he added that he was willing to end his political career over the issue			0
instead , the decision helped him develop a strong fundraising base among advocates of lgbt rights in @entity7			1
@entity77 is now serving his second term as lieutenant governor -- an office with limited powers that has made it more difficult for him to directly influence policy			0
but as a member of the @entity100 , he has tried to block tuition hikes and develop proposals to improve higher education -- endearing him to the younger generation of @entity105			0
he has also outlined his agenda to reinvigorate the state 's manufacturing base and enhance the work force , as well as ideas to reduce homelessness , which he tackled as @entity22 's mayor			0
when he left that office in 2010 , @entity77 claimed he had reduced the level of homelessness in @entity22 by 40 % over his tenure , by moving many of them into supportive housing			0
@entity77 proposed an interagency council on the homeless to gov. @entity23 after taking his no. 2 post , but got nowhere			0
@entity122 on @entity6 retirement : ' what ? ' @entity77 and @entity23 have had a notably frosty relationship over the years			0
when @entity77 briefly ran for governor in 2009 , he told @entity128 delegates at a state convention that he represented the party 's future and compared a vote for @entity23 ( who had not yet announced ) to a " stroll down memory lane			1
" with @entity23 in the wings , @entity77 struggled to raise money and withdrew from the race			2
@entity137 @entity139 's long career in the public eye has included stints as a union organizer , speaker of the @entity144 and most recently mayor of @entity1 between 2005 and 2013			0
his deep roots within @entity7 's @entity148 community boosted his margins in each of his campaigns , and would give him a notable edge in a statewide race			1
he was a controversial figure as a mayor -- often criticized for having big ambitions and limited follow through			0
but he presided over a drop in violent crime and major initiatives to make the city more energy - efficient			2
most notably , he doggedly pursued funding to improve @entity1 ' woefully incomplete public transit system			0
he championed a 2008 voter initiative for a half - cent sales tax increase over 30 years that accelerated funding for expanding rail networks around @entity167 , as well as @entity1 's long - awaited " @entity168			2
" ( for now , that line wo n't actually make it all the way to the ocean , but construction recently began on the extension that will run to @entity175 by 2035 )			0
ironically , the battles that @entity139 took on during his time as mayor might endear him to some independent voters in @entity7 , but have complicated his relationship with labor groups ( whose financial support and manpower can not be underestimated in an expensive statewide race )			1
though @entity139 was once an organizer for the @entity185 of @entity1 , he engaged in a bitter battle with the teachers ' union as he tried unsuccessfully to assert control over the troubled @entity190			0
his relationship with city employee unions also suffered during the city 's financial crisis after the recession when he tangled with city workers over raises , layoffs and what he viewed as much - needed pension reforms			2
@entity201 @entity201 , the billionaire investor who spent more than $ 74 million -- much of it his own money -- during the 2014 midterms to try to make climate change a key issue , is one of the few potential contenders who could fund his own bid for @entity6 's @entity11 seat			1
@entity211 has estimated the net worth of the former hedge fund manager at $ 1.6 billion			2
he and his wife , @entity214 , have pledged to give away the bulk of their fortune to philanthropic and public interest causes			0
@entity201 's enormous investment in the midterms through his @entity221 had little demonstrable success in what turned out to be a @entity15 wave in november			1
but the @entity128 activist has dismissed the notion that @entity15 gains last year would discourage him from future political endeavors			1
he told the @entity229 after the election that he felt " great " about what his organization had been able to do			0
" we set out to put climate on the ballot in a bunch of states , to build an organization and to build a relationship with a bunch of voters , " @entity201 said			1
he has said he is committed to advancing his agenda over several election cycles			0
while @entity201 may be weighing a run for @entity6 's seat , he is also intrigued by the possibility of running for governor when @entity23 leaves office in 2018 .			1

several key @entity128 could enter race with a strong fundraising advantage
with thin @entity15 field , @entity7 could see runoff between two *democrats*
billionaire @entity201 could scramble race with ability to self - fund
