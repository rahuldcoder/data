@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 helicopter came in from the west , the " pop , pop , pop " of its blades announcing its arrival			1
it made a sharp right - hand turn and flared to a landing in the grassy area			1
the ragtag troop of 10 passengers awaiting its arrival looked far from @entity18 issue , dressed in @entity20 shirts , t - shirts , blue jeans , shorts and ball caps			1
they ducked their heads beneath the blades of the spinning rotor as they made their way to the copter from a protected area off to its front			1
but @entity35 capt. @entity34 , a four - tour veteran of @entity36 , needed help			1
he was paralyzed from the waist down , and to make this flight , he 'd need the assistance of others			1
the @entity18 copter 's crew obliged , six of them gathering to lift @entity45 into the outside seat on right side of the chopper , the crew chief strapping him in to the canvas seat so he would n't fall out the open door			1
@entity34 beamed as his helpers retreated			2
the copter fidgeted a bit as the pilot applied power			2
the skids left the ground , and after a short rotation to the right , @entity59 sped away on one of more than a dozen hops it would fly this day , one of countless such hops it had flown since it was put into service in @entity36 more than 40 years ago			1
this is a story of heroes , both mechanical and flesh and blood			2
none of them will call themselves that , the @entity4 because , well , it ca n't			2
the men who fly it and fly on it this march afternoon because they 're way too humble for any bombast			2
but i 'm the witness			2
i 've seen what these guys do , and i 'm declaring them heroes			2
the flight crew on this march saturday are from the nonprofit @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity1			1
they volunteer countless hours to restore and maintain @entity18 helicopters from the @entity36 era and then take them to air shows across the country where you can fly on them			1
yes , you can fly with heroes			2
they are guys like @entity96 , the pilot of @entity59 , carrying @entity34 this saturday morning at the @entity98 airshow in @entity0 , @entity1			2
@entity96 , 65 , is the assistant dean of the @entity99 these days			2
but he 's a veteran of two tours in @entity36 , first as an infantry officer and then as a @entity4 pilot			1
he knows what the @entity4 meant from above and below			2
" it was a love - hate relationship as an infantry officer in @entity36 , " he said			1
they dropped troops into tough spots but were there to get them out			0
" swore at ' em when they left , could n't wait for them to show up , " he said			0
that was a lot of swearing and cheering in @entity36			1
more than 9,400 @entity112 were built , according to the foundation			0
more than 2,000 flew in the war , in @entity115 knows how many missions			0
watch any news footage from the time , and you 'll probably see the @entity4 , ferrying troops to and from the field , their door gunners firing away at treelines to protect the @entity120			0
the @entity4 was there at the end too , making flights from the roof of the @entity130 in @entity131 as it was overrun in 1975			0
@entity4 was in the fight			0
the aircraft giving rides in @entity1 this saturday in march flew 1,417 combat hours in @entity36			1
ask the @entity138 guys , and they 'll show you the hole in the floor at the left rear			0
patched over now , it 's where an enemy round passed through during combat in 1971			1
after that damage , @entity147 probably flew @entity4 354			0
the @entity150 , @entity151 , native and @entity84 member is a businessman now			1
in @entity36 , he was the maintenance test pilot for his unit , nicknamed " the @entity155			1
" that meant before any copter could go on a mission after repairs or servicing , @entity156 took it up to make sure it worked			0
" that 's why i knew i flew 354 , because i flew every helicopter once every couple of months , " he said			0
you can see the unit 's logo on the front of @entity59 today			0
@entity147 , who flew under the call sign " @entity171 " in @entity36 , does n't fly copters these days			1
but he stopped by the foundation 's hangar in suburban @entity175 a while back to reconnect with the @entity4			0
" i did n't get emotional about sitting in it or anything , but it was just kind of a neat deal , " @entity147 said			0
" forty to 45 years later , to be able to sit in something that was that big a deal as part of your life is kind of cool			0
" back in @entity0 , @entity34 is on the ground after a 10 - minute hop in @entity59			1
the crew that got him on the aircraft has repeated the procedure , transferring the 75 - year - old as gently as possible from helicopter to his motorized wheelchair			1
but there 's a hitch ; the chair ca n't seem to navigate the grassy ground where @entity96 has set down the @entity4			0
the crews will have to carry chair and passenger to the tarmac			0
there are no complaints from @entity45			0
" i 'm not bitter , " he said			0
" i signed up for the @entity18			0
" so what did he do in @entity36 ? behind him , his daughter , 56 - year - old @entity205 , shakes her head			1
" i do n't talk about that			0
never have , " the former @entity18 captain said			0
what he will tell you is what these @entity4 rides mean to him : " everything ! " and that means if you come to @entity0 next march , you could fly with this hero			1
" the good lord willing , i 'll be back next year ; yes , i will , " he said .			0
