the legal fight over head injuries in football has made its way to the high school arena -- and is heading to court			1
a former @entity7 high school football player has filed a class - action lawsuit against the @entity9 over concussions protocols and management			1
" it 's the first - ever class action filed against a state high school association , " said attorney @entity12 , who filed on behalf of 29 - year - old @entity13			1
@entity12 also is the attorney who filed the class action against the @entity18 over concussions -- the one that has reached a preliminary settlement with the @entity18 that could change the rules of the college game if it 's approved by a judge			1
" our goal is to bring the fight to the high school level , " @entity12 said			2
lawsuits already exist that seek damages from the @entity18 and @entity32 over how concussions are handled in college and pro ball			2
but neurosurgeons say that adolescent head injuries can be the most damaging , since they happen during a crucial developmental period			0
while the high school suit is , right now , only filed in @entity7 , @entity12 said the goal is to sue every state high school athletic association in the country , changing the rules in each state to make the game safer			1
@entity13 , who attended @entity45 in @entity7 from 1999 to 2003 , had many concussions during his high school career , the lawsuit said , but was never educated on the effects or the risks			1
more than 10 years later , he still suffers from migraines and memory loss , his lawsuit says			1
the suit alleges that the @entity9 has failed young athletes because it " does not mandate specific guidelines or rules on managing student - athlete concussions and head injuries , " and " fails to mandate the removal of athletes who have appeared to suffer in practice ( as opposed to games )			2
" it also does not have baseline testing , and does have medical staff with concussion training present at games , the suit says			0
a spokesman for @entity9 , which is a not - for - profit that regulates high school sports in the state , told @entity73 monday that the suit was filed saturday as the state 's championship games were being played			1
the spokesman , @entity76 , assistant executive director , provided @entity73 with a statement released on saturday by @entity9 executive director @entity78			0
" we will review the contents of the lawsuit in the coming days and comment if and when it is appropriate , " @entity78 said in the statement			0
" student - athlete risk minimization , especially as it relates to concussion management in high school football , is and remains a top priority of the @entity9			1
we believe that the @entity9 , in working with national partners like the @entity88 ( @entity88 ) , has and will continue to be a leader in this area			0
" bringing the legal fight to the high school level was almost inevitable			2
similar lawsuits have been filed at the college and pro sport level , but both have met controversy			2
the @entity18 suit , which is awaiting a judge 's ruling on a $ 75 million settlement , is opposed by many @entity18 critics who say it does n't go far enough and does n't directly benefit any of the players who have been injured			0
the $ 75 million would go to screening and research and lawyer fees , but not the players			0
" the players are being sold out for $ 15 million in legal fees and the @entity18 could n't be happier , " said @entity108 , president of the @entity109			0
he says the @entity18 settlement did n't address enough key issues that lead to head trauma , like the number of contact practices each season			0
in pro football , an initial $ 765 million settlement was rejected by a federal judge , and then accepted later when the @entity32 agreed to put no cap on the monetary awards for thousands of former @entity32 players who have sued the league over injuries .			0
