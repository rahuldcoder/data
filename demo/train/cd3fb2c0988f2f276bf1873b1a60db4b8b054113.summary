@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity3 , the @entity4 and @entity5 -- all african - americans who made history breaking the color barrier			1
but while @entity12 's first black @entity11 justice , the first @entity14 oscar winner and the @entity12 military 's first @entity14 - @entity14 pilots are well known , you may never have heard of @entity5 or his role in @entity14 history			1
the @entity20 , as the @entity19 used to be called , wanted it that way			0
in march , a ceremony at the @entity23 sought to undo that			1
when @entity5 first joined the @entity26 just before @entity27 , he was n't a " black " or " @entity28 " or " @entity14 " soldier -- he was " colored			1
" and he was treated like all the other " colored " men who wanted to fight for their country			0
" we were servants , we were not soldiers , " @entity5 said			1
" most of us had an inferiority complex and it was a result of what they had assigned us to do			0
" in the @entity38 in the 1940s , racism was out in the open , including in the @entity26			1
" you could walk down the street in the main post exchange area and in the summer the door would be open and you could look in and see white soldiers and prisoners of war from @entity47 sitting at the same table drinking , smoking , " @entity5 said			1
" that in itself gave you this inferiority complex			0
you are in uniform and you could n't go in , but the prisoners could go in and have coffee and cigarettes			0
" but by the time he left the @entity26 , @entity5 would become the first " colored " man ever to earn the @entity26 @entity58			1
it 's all because he wanted to overcome that " inferiority complex			0
" @entity5 was the sergeant for a unit of black soldiers at @entity63 , @entity64			1
that 's where the @entity26 was training white soldiers to be @entity58 parachutists			1
so after watching the white soldiers training , he would gather up black soldiers who had finished their jobs as cooks , guards or drivers , and they would duplicate the training the white trainees had just gone through			0
" we went to the calisthenics field and we knew the routine because we had watched them			0
... we started with the five - foot platform where they jumped into the pit , " @entity5 said			1
" the most interesting thing of that was the replica of a @entity85 plane -- the body of it -- and the students went in there and sat down and they pretended to be paratroopers , " @entity5 said			1
while @entity5 was trying to build his men 's self - esteem , the @entity20 was quietly considering creating an all - black paratrooper unit			1
@entity5 soon found himself with a new job as the top noncommissioned officer for the new unit dedicated to training @entity12 's first " colored " parachutists , the @entity97 , or the @entity98			1
they decided to spell it differently from " nickel " to make sure people knew they were unique			0
the unit had plenty of doubters			2
" they did n't think colored soldiers had the intestinal fortitude to jump out of a plane in flight , " @entity5 remembered			1
but the men proved the doubters wrong			0
twenty soldiers started the training and on february 18 , 1944 , 17 soldiers graduated and earned the @entity58			0
as the unit 's first sergeant , @entity5 was the first man of the 555th to be pinned with the coveted " wings			1
" " that was the happiest day of my life , because now i was a combat paratrooper , " @entity5 said			1
but happiness was soon replaced by reality			0
@entity124 was approaching and the @entity98 wanted badly to jump into @entity125 to fight the @entity126			0
but the white officers who supported the @entity98 could n't convince the generals in charge in the @entity125 theater to put the unit to use			2
" the @entity26 had no place for us , " @entity5 recalls			1
" none of the commanding generals wanted the extra problem of integrating colored soldiers with the white soldiers , so they refused			0
" but soon the @entity141 military created a need for the @entity98 's special skills -- and this is why @entity5 is not as well known as @entity2 or @entity3			1
the only military attack to hit the @entity12 mainland during @entity27 involved incendiary balloons			1
the @entity141 released bomb - laden balloons into the winds that carried across the @entity150 towards the @entity12 @entity151			1
the intent was to set fires in cities such as @entity155 , @entity0 , or @entity156 , @entity157			2
more often than not the balloons simply started huge forest fires			2
but the @entity141 did n't know what the balloons were accomplishing			0
the @entity20 wanted the fires put out and wanted to make sure the news did n't get out			2
the @entity164 needed help putting the fires out			2
@entity5 and the members of the @entity98 packed up and flew west			2
even they did n't know where they were going			0
" it was a secret mission called @entity171			2
we thought we were going overseas to [ gen. @entity175 ] @entity174 's theater , " @entity5 said			2
it was n't until they arrived in @entity178 that they learned they 'd be fighting the @entity141 on the fire line in the @entity182			0
with some quick training , the @entity98 became the " @entity184 " -- firefighters who parachuted into rugged mountain terrain with nothing but shovels , axes and basic supplies			0
their mission meant they had to get the fire under control or out before they could return to base			0
after 1,200 jumps , the fire season and the war were over			0
but because @entity171 started out as a secret , the @entity98 's contribution to protecting the home front and to history was all but lost			0
now the @entity23 wants to change that , honoring the @entity98			2
of those first 17 graduates , three are still alive -- @entity5 , @entity205 and @entity206			2
they were the guests of honor at a ceremony recently at the @entity23			1
they may not be as well known as other trailblazers in @entity212 , but they were every bit the pioneers they trained to be .			0

@entity5 joined @entity26 just before @entity27 when *segregation* still ruled
he became head of new @entity14 - @entity14 unit , the @entity97
@entity223 wound up fighting fires in western @entity12 in a mission that was kept secret
@entity23 to honor their contributions in *thursday* ceremony
