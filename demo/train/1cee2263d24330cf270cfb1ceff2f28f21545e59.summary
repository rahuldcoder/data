-- the threesome of @entity2 , @entity3 , and @entity4 proved to be too much for " captain america : the winter soldier			1
" @entity8 's raunchy girlfriends comedy , about two mistresses who team up with a man 's insecure wife to ruin his life and rediscover theirs , earned $ 24.7 million to bump the @entity16 superhero from his three - week box office run at no. 1			1
it was a surprisingly high number for " @entity20 , " given that some analysts speculated the movie would do about half that by appealing strictly to female moviegoers			1
given @entity2 's comedy track record with everything from @entity28 to bad teacher , those concerns did n't really hold " @entity20 " back			1
also , when you cast @entity34 swimsuit model @entity32 as a scantily clad character referred to as " the boobs " in a movie 's trailer , it 's not exactly bro - repellent			2
still , @entity8 tells ew its own tracking showed 75 percent of ticket - buyers were female , which is slightly higher than even the studio expected			2
the strong overall tally came from underestimating just how large that audience would be , and @entity8 now hopes word - of - mouth will help it draw in a more diverse crowd in the weeks ahead , much as @entity49 's " bridesmaids " did in 2011			0
@entity0 : review of ' @entity20 ' " @entity5 " sank to a respectable no. 2 , still going strong in its fourth weekend , for a weekend yield of $ 16 million and a domestic total of $ 225 million ( and roughly $ 645 million globally )			1
the first " @entity5 " ended at $ 177 million domestically , and a mere $ 370 million worldwide			0
dropping only 37 percent from last week , the action / adventure is showing remarkable resilience , and sets a very high bar for upcoming superhero flicks , such as next week 's " @entity58 " ( which has already opened in some international markets and has earned a robust $ 132 million ) and " x-men : @entity63 , " which debuts may 23 but is currently reeling from the underage , forced sex allegations recently leveled at filmmaker @entity62			1
@entity66 's spiritual melodrama " @entity67 " came in third for the weekend with $ 13.8 million , also showing strength with only a 39 percent drop in its second week			0
@entity0 review of ' captain america : the winter soldier ' among new releases , the no. 5 spot went to the late @entity76 's " @entity75 , " a wall - climbing , face - slamming , parkour - based action movie about a cop seeking revenge against the crime lord who killed his father			1
the @entity84 release , a remake of the @entity87 crime thriller " @entity88 , " earned $ 9.6 million			0
it was initially in the fourth spot on friday night , but family matinee moviegoers gave the animated " @entity93 " a saturday boost			1
the @entity99 horror flick " @entity97 " lived up to its name â € ” it came in seventh place with a lame $ 7 million , behind even the @entity102 box - office catastrophe " @entity103 , " which was no. 6 with $ 7.1 million			2
here are estimate of the weekend 's top five , with final numbers due monday : 1			2
the other woman -- $ 24.7 million 2			0
@entity5 : the winter soldier -- $ 16 million 3			0
@entity67 -- $ 13.8 million 4			0
@entity93 â € ” $ 13.6 million 5			2
