@entity15 had put @entity3 ahead with a header from a corner just before the interval and doubled the home side 's advantage on the hour mark with a piece of brilliance -- bringing down a cross from @entity25 before executing a superb overhead volley that found the net via the underside of the crossbar			0
but @entity5 came back into the game just five minutes later , @entity13 scoring from the penalty spot after @entity31 had been fouled in the area by @entity33			2
and the comeback looked to be complete when @entity13 netted from a direct free - kick that went straight through the @entity3 defensive wall			2

@entity67 tapped home the second , after @entity70 had beaten the visitors offside trap , and @entity70 himself added a third with a deflected shot			0
@entity67 added his second just before half - time but @entity58 's defence held firm after the break and @entity53 were unable to add to an impressive record of 21 goals in their opening five matches			1
