@entity0 -- as the new evangelist for entrepreneurship , president @entity2 is finally on the right track			1
mentioning " small business " 14 times in his @entity7 address last week , he pledged to increase small business lending and provide tax incentives to jump - start new jobs			1
and pivoting from propping up " too big to fail " behemoths to boosting more nimble job generators is smart			0
after all , mom and pop shops , small enterprises , and garage start - ups get @entity18 on the payroll			1
@entity21 ( @entity21 ) data shows that small companies have generated 64 percent of net new jobs annually over the past 15 years			2
what 's more , a @entity25 study reveals that firms less than five years old are the engine of this growth			0
yet , for these businesses the recession has been particularly acute			2
according to a @entity35 report last year , @entity18 businesses with fewer than 20 employees have suffered steeper job losses than bigger companies			1
with unemployment hovering at 10 percent , the president must kick - start small business			2
in an appearance in @entity42 , @entity43 , yesterday , @entity2 detailed his proposed small business lending program			1
let 's examine his proposals : $ 30 billion of federal bailout funds redirected to community banks to lend to small business			2
yesterday in @entity42 , president @entity2 unveiled his proposal to redirect $ 30 billion of @entity51 ( @entity51 ) funds to create a new @entity53 for community banks			2
to do this , the @entity55 has said , would require an act of @entity58 to change current law			0
on @entity61 yesterday , @entity55 budget director @entity60 met with severe criticism from sen. @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , who accused the administration of viewing @entity51 as a " piggy bank " and using it for political purposes			0
certainly access to credit is the lifeblood of small business and has been sorely lacking			0
if we are to direct funds to community banks , we must not make the same mistake twice			0
federal funds must come with mandatory loan distribution requirements to ensure that banks actually lend			0
better yet , @entity2 should channel capital to small businesses through the @entity21 directly			1
pending legislation introduced by sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , proposes funneling bailout funds through the @entity21 itself			0
the infrastructure is in place and such a process would be quicker and more efficient			0
at a minimum , @entity2 needs to empower the @entity21 with funding for consistent loan guarantees			2
as part of the @entity93 , the @entity21 raised guarantees from 75 to 90 percent and eliminated fees , making it more attractive for banks to lend			0
this was helpful , but inconsistent funding left 1,069 small businesses on a waiting list in late 2009			1
subsequent funding was extended , but this on - again , off - again fluctuation makes it impossible for small businesses to plan , and in some cases , survive			1
tax credits for new hires and wage increases			0
the goal of this program is to encourage on - the - fence businesses to take the plunge and hire new workers			2
while tax credits rarely provide the reason to add new staff , for businesses anticipating growth , this nudge can catalyze hiring			2
as part of @entity2 's $ 33 billion tax credit proposal , employers would get a $ 5,000 tax credit for every net new worker hired in 2010 and reimbursement for @entity128 taxes paid when they increase wages			1
by limiting the maximum credit to $ 500,000 per company , the intention is to focus on small companies , though all businesses would be eligible			1
elimination of capital - gains tax on investments in small business			1
this is a winning proposal			0
for small companies seeking investment , a zero - rate capital gains tax will attract private investors who together with friends and family provide essential funding for small business start - ups			1
such incentives will reward entrepreneurs who take start - up risks , and create a more level playing field for worldwide investors , as many other countries do not tax capital gains			1
tax incentives for investment in new facilities and equipment			2
allowing companies to write off , instead of depreciate , new equipment helps businesses buy things they were already planning to buy			0
encouraging businesses to ramp up sooner accelerates job creation			2
in addition , @entity2 's @entity7 pledge to double @entity18 export growth over the next five years bolsters small and big businesses alike			1
real growth comes from our links with the rest of the world , and the passage of stalled trade agreements with @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 would open those countries ' markets to @entity18 goods			0
promotion of free trade and the creation of a national export initiative would boost not only traditional exports , but also spark an uptick in exports of new services such as marketing or accounting services			0
one thing missing that would help stimulate jobs is immigration reform			1
over the last decade and a half , fully one - quarter of all technology firms founded in the @entity18 were started by immigrants ; @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 to name a few			1
changing the provisions of the eb - 5 visa or " entrepreneur 's visa " to favor those who plan to start companies and extending their visas as they hire @entity18 workers would spark job creation			1
simply put , the @entity18 needs global talent to help create jobs at home			1
given the turbulence of the last 18 months , many small businesses remain cautious about hiring , and policy uncertainty is not helping			1
health care reform , energy policy , tax policy and financial regulatory reform are all outstanding questions with significant implications for the cost of labor			0
clarity on some of these issues will help businesses make hiring commitments			0
as @entity2 juggles the need to boost employment without adding significantly to our nation 's debt , he is wise to focus on entrepreneurs			1
what he must remember is that small is big			0
to get our country back up on its feet , we must help small business get back to work			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			0

@entity248 says @entity2 's new focus on small businesses and jobs is on track
she says small businesses , the engines for @entity18 job *recovery* , took hit in recession
@entity2 's plan for lending , tax breaks , incentives could go even further , she says
@entity264 : give *sba* a role in loans ; reform immigration to bring job - creating talent to @entity18
