when fishing in fiercely - contested territorial waters , a certain amount of risk must be assumed			2
for the crew of @entity7 fishing boat @entity5 , the worst - case scenario happened early last week when their ship was capsized by what they insist was a @entity12 military vessel			1
the ship 's captain , @entity13 , told @entity15 via an interpreter that on may 26 , he and his crew were sailing in @entity7 @entity18 ( @entity18 ) waters , around 17 nautical miles ( @entity20 ) from a @entity12 oil rig near the @entity22			1
the islands in the @entity24 have become the centerpiece in a territorial row between @entity12 and @entity7			1
the crew was working their wooden fishing boat around 4 p.m. when they noticed a vessel steaming towards their ship			1
" after this , we ran away			0
they crashed into our right side and then the left			0
then our boat turned over			2
all ten crew members had to swim			2
after this , we were rescued by ( sister ship ) @entity41			0
we swam for around ten minutes			0
" the fishermen 's report is at odds with the @entity12 version of events			1
according to @entity12 's state - run @entity48 news agency , the @entity7 vessel had been " harassing " a @entity12 fishing boat in waters near the @entity22 , a largely uninhabited archipelago also known by the @entity12 as the @entity22			1
the @entity48 report said the ship overturned after it " jostled " a @entity12 fishing boat			1
lucky escape @entity13 counts his blessings that the other @entity7 fishing boat was nearby and able to rescue him and his crew			1
" we are very lucky that the crash happened during the daytime			0
we were lucky that some friends could see us			0
" the incident , from first collision to the abandonment of the vessel took only four minutes , @entity13 says			1
the crew did n't even have time to don life jackets			2
two of his crew suffered minor injuries including @entity74 , who suffered abrasions on his leg , shoulder and chest , as well as a cut near his right eye			2
" the @entity12 ship ( s ) made no attempt to rescue our crew , " @entity13 said			1
" we saw a lot of @entity12 ships -- only one was used to ram us , but there were lots around			1
despite the sinking , none of the @entity12 ships acted ( to rescue the crew )			1
" the boat , which was valued at 5 billion @entity94 ( $ 237,000 ) , remains scuttled in the seas around the @entity22			1
because of superstition , the boat is unlikely to be salvaged and used again , says its owner , @entity98			2
the boat had fished these waters for years before the recent controversy arose , @entity74 said			0
he said that isolated incidents had occurred between ships from the two sides for several years , but since the oil rig had been installed , the number of attacks has escalated sharply			0
shifting blame the official @entity12 line is that the sinking is entirely the fault of the @entity7 crew			1
" one @entity7 fishing boat forcefully intruded into the caution area of @entity12 981 drilling rig and ran into the left side of a @entity12 fishing boat at the site and then capsized , " @entity12 @entity114 spokesman @entity113 said at a briefing the day after the incident			1
" i want to stress that the direct cause for this incident is ... the @entity7 side			0
" @entity13 and his crew deny this version of events			0
" the @entity12 statement is wrong , " @entity13 said			1
" the @entity12 ship was six times larger ( than our fishing boat )			1
our ship is wooden , that one was steel			0
it is nonsense that our boat would approach or try to ram a ship that size			0
" government involvement ? @entity13 says he suspects that the boat belonged to the @entity142 and was disguised to look like a fishing vessel , because it contained a steel hull , rather than the traditional wood			1
he says it was also flying a @entity12 flag , although in these waters , where national identity means everything , this does n't necessarily indicate official involvement in the incident			1
however , he says experience tells them that it was a government vessel			0
@entity74 chimes in : " we only saw one person on the @entity12 ship			2
he threw a glass bottle at our boat			0
besides him , we did n't see anyone			0
" the @entity12 government has not offered compensation , says @entity162 , the boat 's owner			1
they have not had any contact from the @entity12 at all			2
they can not afford to buy a new boat , she says			0
" now the crew are jobless , " she says			0
" we have to lay them off until we have the new ship			0
this incident has cost us 5 billion @entity94 ( $ 237,000 )			0
our family lives off the revenue of fishing and we have n't raised the money to buy a new one			0
" the local government has offered around 800 million @entity94 ( $ 37,800 ) in compensation , and a government official tells @entity15 that the local authorities also cover the fishing fleet 's insurance , which will pay out around half the cost of a new boat			1
despite the real , present danger that fishing these waters has presented , the @entity7 owner and crew are not willing to cede an inch of territory			2
" of course we have to return to the @entity22 , " @entity162 says			0
" it 's the traditional area of @entity7 fishing			2
they are the only good fishing areas for us			0
