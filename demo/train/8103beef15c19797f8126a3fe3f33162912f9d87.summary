-- cleanup workers exposed to spilled oil may be at long - term risk for breathing trouble and other health problems , according to a new study examining the aftereffects of a 2002 oil spill in @entity9			1
however , it 's not clear whether the respiratory problems reported by the workers in the study are likely to crop up in the more than 50,000 people who have helped clean up the spill in the @entity15 caused by the explosion of the @entity18 oil rig			1
" we ca n't assume it 's going to be the same here as it was there , " says @entity19 , @entity20 , a professor of community health and ob - gyn at the @entity23 , in @entity24 , @entity25 " but this shows that there is the potential for health effects that go well beyond the immediate period of exposure , and it reinforces what we 've known before -- that respiratory health effects are high on that list , " adds @entity19 , co-author of an editorial accompanying the study			2
@entity0 : ca n't stop coughing ? 8 possible reasons the study , which appears in the @entity42 , included 501 fishermen who helped clean up spilled oil after the tanker @entity46 sank off the coast of @entity9 in november 2002			1
the researchers compared the workers with a similar group of 176 fishermen who did not participate in the cleanup efforts			0
two years after the accident , the fishermen who were exposed to oil were more likely to report wheezing , chronic cough , and other respiratory symptoms compared with those in the control group			2
the breath of the exposed fishermen also contained higher levels of chemicals associated with lung damage			0
( @entity66 were excluded from these tests			0
) in addition , the researchers found higher rates of chromosome changes in the white blood cells of the exposed fishermen -- changes that have been linked to an increased risk of cancer in other studies , says @entity77 , @entity78 , a senior scientist with the @entity79 , a nonprofit environmental group			2

the study results " indicate that participation in the cleanup of oil spills can have undesirable effects on health , " says the lead researcher , @entity88 , @entity78 , but he stresses that the cleanup workers in the study were n't sick			2
" no evidence was found of any active illness , only biological alterations that might predispose to develop disease , " says @entity88 , a professor at the @entity96 ( @entity97 ) , in @entity98			0
the findings suggest that doctors and health officials in the @entity106 should be on the lookout for respiratory problems in workers who were exposed to the huge amounts of oil that gushed from the recently capped leak in the @entity15			1
@entity0 : breathing tips for people with @entity116 but the two spills are n't necessarily comparable , experts say			0
for starters , the @entity46 spill -- which was roughly one - tenth the size of the @entity18 spill -- involved bunker oil , which contains different proportions of carcinogenic compounds ( notably polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene ) than the crude oil spilled in the @entity15 , according to @entity82			1
moreover , the oil from the @entity46 was spilled on the surface and therefore may have had a different makeup from the oil from the @entity18 well , which ascended through almost a mile of water before it could make human contact , says @entity134 , @entity78 , a professor of occupational and environmental health at the @entity136 at @entity137			1
the oil that cleanup workers in the @entity15 will encounter is " reasonably friendly bad stuff , " @entity134 says			1
" the likelihood of respiratory problems for these workers is negligible			1
" oil is n't the only hazard , @entity134 points out			0
the dispersants used in both cleanup efforts could potentially cause respiratory effects as well			0
@entity0 : @entity15 oil spill still a health threat to many the @entity106 @entity152 recently announced the launch of a long - term study , known as the @entity155 , to investigate potential health problems stemming from the @entity18 spill			1
although the @entity46 spill may not be a perfect comparison , it still highlights the need to safeguard cleanup workers in the @entity106 , @entity82 says			2
" @entity15 workers need to have adequate training and protective equipment , as well as access to health care and evaluations , " she says			1
" and they are going to need careful follow - up for years to come to make sure that if they do develop health problems , they are recognized and addressed			0

workers exposed to spilled oil may be at long - term risk for breathing trouble
doctors should be on the lookout for respiratory problems in the @entity15 workers
the @entity155 will investigate the @entity18 spill
