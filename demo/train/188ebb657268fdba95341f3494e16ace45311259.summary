@entity0 -- the heir to the @entity5 throne , crown prince sultan bin @entity2 , died in a @entity6 early saturday , officials said , raising succession questions in the key oil - producing country at a time of regional turmoil			1
@entity13 , the half - brother of @entity14 , was thought to be in his 80s			1
he had been ill for some time -- various reports indicated that he was battling cancer -- and was receiving treatment in @entity0			1
@entity5 television broke into normal programming early saturday to announce the death			0
it broadcast quranic verses and footage of pilgrims in the holy city of @entity28			0
@entity13 's body will be flown back to @entity5 and a burial is scheduled for tuesday			1
he had served for decades as the @entity5 defense minister			0
president @entity32 called him a " valued friend " of the @entity34			1
" he was a strong supporter of the deep and enduring partnership between our two countries , " @entity32 said			1
" on behalf of the @entity34 people , i extend my deepest condolences to @entity14 , the royal family , and the people of @entity5			1
@entity42 , a former @entity34 ambassador to @entity5 , called @entity13 a " staunch ally			1
" " his passing marks the end of a significant era in @entity5 , " he said			0
" the steps taken to select a new crown prince will be scrutinized by the world and will provide insight into @entity14 's vision for future leadership of the @entity53			1
" ascension to the @entity5 throne does not pass from father to son			0
rather , it 's a complex process and decisions are always cloaked in secrecy in the conservative kingdom			2
@entity14 set up the @entity62 in 2006 to allow for more transparency in succession			1
it is unclear when this group , made up of members of the royal family , will be employed to make a decision on the next crown prince			0
@entity13 's death leaves his brother @entity2 , a reputed conservative , as the likely successor to the king			1
@entity14 appointed @entity2 in 2009 as the country 's second deputy prime minister , a post held by the second in line to the throne			1
@entity2 has been the interior minister since 1975 and as such , he oversaw the kingdom 's counterterrorism efforts			2
@entity5 is one of the only countries that has truly dismantled a domestic @entity86 network , said @entity87 , a @entity5 expert at the @entity88			0
" @entity2 is widely seen as a hard - line conservative who at best is lukewarm to @entity14 's reform initiatives , " said a classified @entity34 embassy cable leaked by the website @entity90			1
" however , it would be more accurate to describe him as a conservative pragmatist convinced that security and stability are imperative to preserve @entity2 rule and ensure prosperity for @entity5 citizens , " the cable said			1
but @entity87 said little has changed			0
" the king is still in charge , and nothing will change until the throne passes from him to the next brother			0
" @entity110 , a @entity111 professor who has authored books on the @entity113 , said @entity2 is hardly one to blaze a path for political reform , but that 's not to say @entity5 will feel any reverberations			2
" there is truth to the idea that @entity2 is not someone who sees political reform as a major goal of the government , " @entity110 said			2
" but i do not want to say that if he were to become king , he would act in the same way as he is now			0
" @entity5 is not immune to the sort of popular uprisings that have brought down regimes in @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
the nation suffers from the same political and economic issues , @entity110 said			0
but the difference , he said , is that @entity5 is wealthy and the king has recently deployed huge amounts of money for housing and salaries			0
also saturday , @entity14 left a hospital in @entity144 following successful back surgery , the @entity142 reported			1
@entity14 , 87 , will complete his recuperation at the royal palace			2

" he was very much loved by the country			0
" he took a leading role in @entity5 's involvement in the @entity164 against @entity165 , heading a coalition of about half a million troops from more than 30 countries			0
of his many children , perhaps the best known internationally is @entity169 , @entity5 's former ambassador to the @entity34			2
@entity169 served as ambassador from 1983 to 2005 and was friends with the family of former president @entity174			2
