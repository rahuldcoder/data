-- the intentional breach of a levee on the @entity4 is helping to ease unprecedented flood pressure on other areas , the @entity1 said			2
the @entity8 level had dropped about 1.7 feet at @entity9 , @entity10 , since monday afternoon , before the blast , but that is expected to level off wednesday			2
the breach , created when engineers detonated explosives late monday night at @entity16 , @entity17 , is sending 396,000 cubic feet of water per second onto 200 square miles of fertile @entity17 farmland			1
the water is coursing across a floodway that @entity17 gov. @entity21 described as " literally the most productive part of our continent			1
" two states grapple with rising floodwaters farmer @entity27 said the sight makes you " sick to your stomach " as he surveyed his submerged fields			1
" farming is all i ever have done ... and it 's under water , " he told @entity0 affiliate @entity32			2
" i really do n't know ( what i 'm going to do )			2
" a second levee blast was conducted tuesday afternoon at @entity38 , @entity17 , and a third is planned wednesday near @entity40 , @entity41			1
the second and third blasts , downstream of @entity16 , will allow floodwater to return to the @entity4			1
while the plan appeared to be working -- the level of the @entity8 fell where it joins the @entity4 -- record crests and relentless pressure from millions of gallons of water still threatened communities throughout the @entity4 and @entity8 river valleys			1
@entity53 , @entity4 , could see water levels rise 4 feet by sunday			2
authorities told residents of @entity57 , @entity17 , that sandbags may not be enough to control the water			1
@entity59 , of @entity60 , @entity17 , said she grew up in @entity61 , @entity17 , which she said was being inundated by the breach on the @entity4			1
a tombstone rests above the remains of her father and uncle , but " i 'm sure we 'll never see it again , " said @entity59 , who said residents of the rich farmland will be out of luck , as opposed to those in @entity9 , for whom the risk has been lessened by the breaches			2
" whoever thought it would be this bad ? " she said			2
the situation was especially perilous for a 93 - year - old woman who was caught in the swollen waters of the @entity83 near @entity84 , @entity17 , where two members of the @entity86 rescued her from a partially submerged car			1
" we were n't there to be heroes , " said sgt. @entity88			2
" we were just doing our jobs			0
" @entity88 , along with spc. @entity93 , waded through the rushing , muddy waters to ferry the woman to safety			0
this " is the reason why i signed up for the guard , " said spc. @entity98			0
the town of @entity9 remained under a mandatory evacuation despite the intentional breach , while six other communities were under voluntary evacuation notices , said @entity106 , spokeswoman for the @entity107			0
" we 're definitely not out of the woods yet , " she said			0
" the levees are all very saturated right now and they 're going to continue to have a lot of pressure on them for several days			1
" even with the levee breach , the @entity113 continues to predict record or near - record flooding in parts of southern @entity10 , southwest @entity117 , western @entity41 and @entity118 , southeastern @entity17 , northeastern @entity119 , and parts of @entity4 and @entity121			1
maj. gen. @entity122 , commander of the @entity123 , made the decision to order the breach			0
he warned that without punching a hole in the levee , massive flooding would threaten to inundate communities throughout the @entity4 and @entity8 river valleys			1
" there 's a tremendous amount of pressure on the system , " he told reporters tuesday evening			0
" the project operated as designed			0
" it was a controversial decision			0
@entity17 officials took the corps to court over the plan , questioning the agency 's authority to intentionally breach the levee			1
the state argued the floodwater would deposit silt on the estimated 130,000 acres , and years , along with millions of dollars , would be required to fix the damage			0
the @entity149 @entity148 declined to intervene in the case on sunday , clearing the way for @entity152 to blow the levee			0
some @entity17 residents were angered by the decision , saying it would destroy their communities and provide questionable benefit			1
but others felt the decision was for the best			0
" yeah , we lost ... acres of farm land here in @entity17 , " said @entity60 , @entity17 , resident @entity158 , who recently fled the drought and firestorms of @entity161 for what she thought would be a more peaceful life in the @entity164			1
" but how much more would we have lost if we had n't done it ? " " the sacrifice that these people are making is for the greater good , " @entity168 with the @entity1 told @entity32			0
" their sacrifices are going to benefit hundreds of thousands of people all through this region			0
it 's not just @entity9			0
it 's people all through this part of the country			0
" @entity152 called the decision to inundate the farmland and about 100 homes " heart - wrenching			1
" " i 've been involved with flooding for 10 years and it takes a long time to recover from something like this , " he said			2
@entity0 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			0

@entity193 says the sight of his submerged farm makes you " sick to your stomach "
operations seems to be working so far , official says
levees are breached at @entity16 and @entity38 , @entity17
