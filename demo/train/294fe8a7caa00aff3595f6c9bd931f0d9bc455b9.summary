-- @entity2 's economy , fattened with foreign investment during its boom - times , has stalled amid warnings its model is unsustainable			1
the country 's $ 800 billion economy remains among the 20 biggest in the world -- but the @entity11 says it ca n't last and remains too vulnerable to dangers outside its borders			1
the @entity15 has also weighed in with concerns , saying the country 's addiction to foreign money risks volatility			0
how did it get into this mess ? many developed countries struggled with growth after the global financial crisis			0
but not @entity2 , which grew substantially over the last decade -- the country 's gdp grew by average 5.5 % per year			1
the government of @entity29 , now a presidential candidate , was praised for its ability to attract foreign investors from @entity33 and emerging markets such as @entity35 and @entity36			1
the rapid economic growth was largely fueled by cheap credit pouring into the country			0
as the crisis hit developed economies , investors turned to emerging markets , which promised higher returns than depressed @entity45 markets			1
for years , @entity2 enjoyed a foreign - funded construction boom			2
@entity48 prices have soared more than 50 % since the end of 2009 and both the country 's gdp and per capita income have increased threefold since 2003			0
but the party ended with the @entity53 announcing a scale - back in its stimulus program last summer			0
suddenly , there was less cash available to invest			0
with more security in the @entity61 economy , investors started pulling their money from the emerging markets			1
@entity2 's growth slowed to just above 2 % in 2013 and the country 's currency , the lira , slumped further in january this year			1
that forced @entity2 's central bank to ratchet up its interest rates from 7.7 % to 12 % -- showing the bank 's determination to prevent foreign capital outflows			2
@entity29 strongly opposed the bank 's move to raise the rates			0
he argued it would hurt @entity2 's growth , blaming the lira 's tumble on the opposition and an " interest rates lobby , " and saying it was the result of a conspiracy			1
what 's the economy doing now ? the @entity15 expects 3.5 % growth in 2014 , picking up slightly from 2013 , but high inflation is pushing the country back and hurting consumers			1
at around 9 % , annual inflation is nearly double the @entity2 central bank 's target of 5 %			1
this , coupled with the country 's low employment rate leads to high levels of poverty			0
in an @entity15 study , one in three @entity2 said they were not able to afford sufficient food			2
the @entity15 average is one in seven			0
furthermore , 20 % of @entity2 live below the relative poverty line , meaning they survive on less then half of the @entity2 median income			1
this makes @entity2 the third poorest developed nation , with @entity106 and @entity107 lagging behind			2
@entity2 's strategic position means the country is the bridge between @entity111 and @entity33			2
its membership of @entity113 and candidacy to join the @entity115 reflect its importance			0
but unrest and uncertainty has already cost the country millions , with its stock market losing a third of its value last year			0
opinion : @entity2 's @entity125 politician targets top post			0

the @entity11 says @entity2 economy remains too vulnerable to dangers outside its borders
@entity2 grew substantially over the last decade as investors turned to emerging markets
but volatility , income *inequality* and high inflation is hurting the growth , @entity11 warns
