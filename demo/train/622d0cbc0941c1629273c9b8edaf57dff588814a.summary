the 29 - year - old has ridden his wave of inner belief to become one of @entity11 's biggest pop stars , and fostered an image of being something of an anti-hero , neither boastful nor too brash			1

music remains his first love , having found success despite being naturally shy			0
he released his first album in 2000 , and eight years and seven albums later he still believes he has plenty of material for songs left in him , breaking from the usual @entity43 - and @entity44 themes of boy - meets - girl			1
in the past his lyrics have ventured into more considered and darker territory with a song about an abusive father and have taken on a variety of themes and genres			0
" i think my music is quite different from the @entity55 rap music culture			0
you wo n't find bad language in my music			0
i have this sense of responsibility to add an educational element in my music			0
