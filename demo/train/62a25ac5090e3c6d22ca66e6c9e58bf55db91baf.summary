@entity0 , @entity1 -- getting heard and understood in @entity3 , @entity0 , on a typical saturday afternoon is a challenge			0
you would have to compete with noise from the constant traffic , the shouts of the road side vendors , music from matatus -- @entity1 's colorful ( and loud ) public transport minibuses			0
on the afternoon of saturday 21 september 2013 you would have had to compete with the additional noise of gunshots and grenades as a group of ruthless and well - drilled militants launched a brutal attack on the @entity20 at the heart of @entity3			0
at least 61 civilians and six @entity25 security officers died in the attack and rescue efforts , president @entity22 said tuesday			0
information on the attack on @entity20 was first broken on social media as those in the mall and its environs flooded their @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 accounts with text and images			1
the amount of information being generated quickly turned into a flood as more and more people started posting or sharing information that was previously posted			0
just like on the streets of @entity3 on a busy saturday afternoon , getting heard on the streets of @entity1 's social media was a big challenge			1
what does attack mean for @entity25 security ? this is not surprising			0
@entity25 increasingly go online to share and look for information			0
information on the large fire at @entity56 in @entity0 on august 7 first broke on social media			1
social media was one of the key sources of information for @entity63 , the citizen centered election monitoring website that was deployed for the @entity25 general election in march			1
previously @entity25 have used @entity35 to organize carpooling during a strike by public transport operators by sharing information using the hashtag @entity69 and even to find out which petrol stations had stocks of fuel during fuel shortages using the hashtag # findfuel			1
ordinary @entity25 citizens have learned how to use social media and other digital tools to amplify their voices in order to have impact			1
research by @entity83 and @entity84 in 2011 found @entity1 as @entity86 's second most active country on @entity35 after @entity86			2
what is new is the increasing presence of official @entity25 government accounts on social media			1
president @entity22 's election campaign invested heavily in its social media and digital communication , and this has continued in government			2
@entity1 's top security decision making body , the @entity101 , includes the president , deputy president , attorney general , and the cabinet secretaries for @entity106 , foreign affairs , and @entity108 and @entity109 , many of whom tweet regularly			0
at security agency level , the @entity110 and @entity111 , the @entity112 , the @entity113 , @entity1 's @entity114 , @entity1 's @entity115 on @entity116 and @entity117 all have active and regularly updated accounts on @entity35			2
during the @entity122 crisis these accounts have been updated with official government information on operations and casualties			2
questions linger after @entity0 mall attack at @entity129 we constantly remind people that technology is a tool not a solution			0
just as a hammer can been used for positive or negative actions social media is also a tool that can be widely exploited across the board			2
@entity139 is very effective in the use of social media and other digital tools in getting its messaging across			2
since saturday when the attacks began @entity35 has already shut down at least one account connected to @entity139 , which may have been in direct contact with the militants inside @entity20			2
having a presence on social media itself presents challenges for officials especially when it comes to the authenticity of the social media accounts			1
the @entity113 for example has a long - running parody unofficial @entity35 account			0
during the @entity122 crisis several of the official @entity25 government @entity35 accounts were verified , a process which establishes their authenticity and allows them to display a badge which identifies them publicly as official channels of communication			1
now that the government 's @entity35 accounts have been identified as authentic the next challenge is to keep them relevant with useful information			2
tweets from government urging @entity25 to hug each other during the height of the crisis were ill timed as the country waited to hear the fate of the hostages still held inside the shopping mall			0
building credibility online , just like building credibility offline , takes time			0
on this the @entity25 government should learn from the digital media team at @entity1 @entity184			1
the @entity1 @entity184 ran the most credible , useful and respected @entity35 account during the entire @entity20 crisis			1
the @entity1 @entity184 is a pioneer in how social media can be used to crowdsource information online that first responders can use			1
through its @entity192 hashtag @entity1 @entity184 encourages all @entity25 to report incidents in which first responders are required and the @entity1 @entity184 follow up these reports dispatching ambulances as required			1
what threat do foreign jihadists pose ? through its social media accounts the @entity1 @entity184 was able to keep large groups of people updated on the @entity20 crisis as it unfolded , was able to source information on where help was required inside and outside @entity20			1
in addition the @entity1 @entity184 digital media team helped coordinate and publicize what was described as the largest blood drive in @entity1 's history			1
about 6,380 units of blood were donated across the country in around 48 hours following the attack			0
in another record - breaking social media led campaign the @entity1 @entity184 partnered with @entity218 , @entity1 's largest mobile phone network , to launch a fundraising drive using @entity218 's @entity222 mobile money platform			1
as of 2pm eat on 25th september , 76 hours after its launch , @entity218 reported that the @entity225 campaign had raised $ 783,485 in donations made largely by individual @entity25			0
this is the latest in a series of successful partnerships between @entity1 @entity184 and @entity218 who also partnered in 2011 to lead the @entity1 campaign which raised around $ 11.5 million in four weeks for @entity25 facing severe famine			1
all these initiatives contribute to the continuing adoption and growth in popularity of social media across the region			2
being able to quickly and accurately filter large volumes of data to identify which pieces of information are useful in your particular incident is a global challenge that @entity129 is working to address by building a coalition and tools for a clearinghouse for crisis data			0
this we believe will lead to more effective online information management such as using citizens to triangulate each other 's information , which in turn gives first responders data on which they can act on immediately			0
once we have this , ordinary citizens using social media would become a much more effective tool in time of crisis , altering today 's communication flows			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267 were .			0
