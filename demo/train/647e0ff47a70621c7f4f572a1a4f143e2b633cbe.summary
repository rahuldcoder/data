@entity0 is the @entity3 party over for @entity4 ? for years , support for @entity4 has been one of the few reliably bipartisan issues on @entity8 , with members on both sides of the aisle embracing the embattled @entity13 country and welcoming its leaders with open arms			1
but when prime minister @entity17 accepted an invitation from @entity20 house speaker @entity19 to address @entity21 on tuesday — when he is expected to sharply criticize @entity22 deal - making with @entity24 — he alienated more than the @entity25 who sits in the @entity26			1
as administration officials have exchanged increasingly hostile volleys with @entity17 , party stalwarts are warning of a @entity3 exodus away from @entity4			1
they caution that the rancor over the speech could accelerate demographic and political trends that suggest support for @entity4 is becoming a partisan issue , with republicans strongly pro and @entity3 less so			1
already 30 @entity22 @entity3 have said they will boycott the speech			1
and when two senior @entity3 senators invited @entity17 for a private conversation during his visit to @entity8 , he said no. ( his office said he also turned down similar requests from @entity20 because he did n't want to politicize the visit			1
) @entity45 leadership on thursday announced that a bipartisan meeting with the prime minister had at last been arranged			0
but many in the @entity3 say the damage done in the run - up to the speech will linger long past tuesday			0
former rep. @entity53 , a @entity54 @entity25 and staunch supporter of @entity4 who left office this year , said that because @entity17 's speech was seen as a rebuke of the president , democrats feel the need to step up to defend @entity62			1
" a lot of @entity3 feel that they have to stick with their president and not take this kind of bipartisan approach , because they 're now looking at it as something that is a partisan attack , " he said			0
and one of the democrats sitting out @entity17 's speech , @entity75 rep. @entity74 , said the address could further fuel @entity4 's detractors in the @entity78			1
" the @entity80 cause has gained more and more support over the years , " he said			0
" i think this has given more reason for people who might 've been in the middle to side with the @entity80			0
" a @entity86 out this week underscored @entity74 's point			0
it found that the percentage of @entity3 sympathizing with @entity4 over @entity80 fell 10 points over the past year , to 48 % , which @entity86 pollster @entity91 wrote was " possibly reflecting the tension between @entity62 and @entity17			1
" meanwhile , @entity20 approval of @entity4 has continued to grow			2
eighty - three percent of @entity20 supported @entity4 over @entity80 in the @entity86 survey			2
that number compensated for the steep drop in support from @entity3 so that overall support for @entity4 among @entity78 remained steady			1
the @entity3 dip aligns with what many democrats say is a growing @entity104 streak within the progressive wing of the party , which is calling for @entity78 leaders to be tougher on @entity4 and offer stronger support for @entity80 statehood			1
@entity74 said that trend could influence @entity3 lawmakers on @entity8			0
" we 've got our opinions , but we respond to our constituents as well , " he said			0
" if they get to be less @entity117 , it makes it more difficult for us to support @entity4			0
" some expressed concerns that @entity17 's speech could also exacerbate demographic trends that suggest younger @entity78 may not offer as robust support for @entity4 as older @entity78 do			1
@entity124 , chairman of the board of the @entity125 , said he 's seen less enthusiastic support among younger voters because , he believes , most of them have never experienced a world in which @entity4 was endangered and needed the strong backing of the @entity78			2
" my concern about the long - term health of the @entity78 - @entity4 relationship and the rock - solid bipartisanship it needs is that the more that @entity4 does that calls into question the support of this cohort of younger voters , the less it is going to be able to rely on this reservoir of good will , " he said			2
@entity3 argue that @entity19 sought to exploit this growing gap in @entity3 support by inviting @entity17 to rebut the president in his own backyard , without adequately consulting with the @entity22			1
former @entity3 rep. @entity145 , an outspoken supporter of @entity4 and critic of @entity17 's move , referred to the invite as a ploy by @entity19 intended to drive a wedge within the @entity3 's backing for @entity4			1
" speaker @entity19 cooking up a scheme to invite the prime minister a few weeks before the election in @entity4 is very harmful to the @entity78 - @entity4 relationship , and particularly harmful to constituents that have traditionally been very , very loyal to @entity4 but not sympathetic to the policies of the @entity4 government , " he said			1
the @entity22 cited the proximity to the @entity4 election in declining to arrange a @entity161 - @entity62 meeting during the prime minister 's visit to @entity0			1
the eventual @entity20 aim , skeptics assert , is to coalesce @entity167 voters and major @entity167 donors behind @entity20			0
even those sounding the alarm over the potential politicization of @entity4 acknowledge that @entity3 support for @entity4 , and @entity167 support for the @entity3 , remains strong			2
but if current trends continue , the @entity78 could see a significant partisan shift on the issue in the coming decades			0
@entity78 @entity167 ' support for the @entity20 has been growing as the population becomes more @entity179 and as some have become more critical of @entity62 's policies in the @entity13			2
according to a @entity183 analysis of exit polling data on midterm @entity22 elections , 33 % of @entity167 voted for @entity20 in 2014 , up from 12 % in 2006			2
and the more observant @entity167 voters are , the more @entity20 they tend to become			0
a 2013 @entity183 survey of @entity167 @entity78 found that @entity179 , who are typically younger and have bigger families , lean @entity20 over @entity3 by a 57 % to 36 % margin			1
that suggests the @entity167 population as a whole may become increasingly @entity20 in the coming decades			0
@entity19 's office pushed back against the claim of @entity20 machinations in the @entity17 invite , with spokesman @entity197 saying that " support for the state of @entity4 in @entity21 and in @entity78 has always been bipartisan , and we hope it always will be			1
" but the @entity22 has charged that @entity19 's invitation was indeed motivated by partisanship — as well as @entity17 's decision to accept so close to the @entity4 vote — and on that basis has been particularly damaging to @entity78 - @entity4 ties			1
" on both sides , there has now been injected a degree of partisanship , which is not only unfortunate , i think it 's destructive of the fabric of the relationship , " national security adviser @entity206 told journalist @entity207 on tuesday			0
@entity20 have argued it 's @entity3 who are politicizing the issue by refusing to attend a speech by a visiting head of state , one of the strongest @entity78 allies abroad , and pointed to @entity222 's comments as further evidence that @entity3 are at fault			1
but even some of @entity17 's supporters acknowledge both sides may be to blame for the politicization of the issue			2
@entity229 , head of the @entity230 of @entity231 and a close ally of @entity17 , said " mistakes were made on both sides in the process			0
" he said it was still in dispute whether @entity19 mismanaged the invitation , but emphasized that the controversy was past and that the two nations need to move on			0
@entity229 echoed concerns of @entity3 that politicizing @entity4 could have grave practical consequences for both nations			2
" we do n't want this to ever become in any way partisan			0
it ca n't be now			0
and all those who try to make it partisan , i think , should be held to account , " he said			0
@entity124 warned that the recent flap is likely to leave lasting damage			0
he charged that the @entity20 efforts " to make @entity4 a wedge issue " are " something they appear to be engaging in for short - term political gain but we believe will have a long - term negative impact			2
