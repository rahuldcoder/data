" sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft , former @entity14 chief @entity13 told @entity1 , and the search for knives interferes with the search for objects that can harm aircraft			1
" in retrospect , i should have done the same thing , " @entity13 said of the rule , which allows passengers to board aircraft with certain small knives , as well as sports equipment such as ice hockey and lacrosse sticks			1
" they ought to let everything on that is sharp and pointy			2
battle axes , machetes ... bring anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able to commit an act of violence , you will not be able to take over the plane			1
it is as simple as that , " he said			0
" so my position would be , bravo on the 2.6 inch knife			0
but why not take it all the way and then really clean up the checkpoint where officers are focusing on bombs and toxins , which are things that can destroy an airplane			1
and it would smooth the process , cost less money , and be better security			0
" asked if he was using hyperbole in suggesting that battle axes be allowed on planes , @entity13 said he was not			1
air marshals , flight attendants want @entity14 to reconsider knife policy " i really believe it			0
what are you going to do when you get on board with a battle ax ? and you pull out your battle ax and say i 'm taking over the airplane			0
you may be able to cut one or two people , but pretty soon you would be down in the aisle and the battle ax would be used on you			0
" and , he pointed out , " you can commit acts of violence on an aircraft with what is allowed now			1
with a @entity80 can , a key , a ruler , and some duct tape , you can make a 12 - inch razor - sharp sword			2
and every eighth - grader would be able to do that			0
" @entity13 headed the @entity14 from mid- 2005 until early 2009 , during the @entity85 administration			1
during his term , the agency loosened restrictions on some items -- such as cigarette lighters , matches and small scissors -- while imposing limits on liquids and gels because of the august 2006 liquid bomb scare			0
the @entity14 's current administrator , @entity97 , was serving as deputy director of the @entity99 during the 2006 bomb scare , and has also cited the plot as a reason for the emphasis on bombs			2
" if undetected , i believe there is a high likelihood the terrorists would have killed hundreds of people that day , " @entity97 says on the @entity14 blog			0
" that 's why we limit the amount of liquids you can bring on a plane			2
" opinion : is @entity14 serious about letting people carry knives ? both @entity13 and @entity119 have embraced " risk - based security , " the concept that the government should use intelligence and best practices to focus on known threats and unknown people			1
the @entity14 has expanded its @entity128 program under @entity119 , expediting travel for frequent fliers and others who provide information on themselves			0
@entity13 and other security experts say a number of factors -- including strengthened cockpit doors , better intelligence and motivated passengers -- has changed the security equation on planes , removing avenues once open to terrorists			1
@entity13 said he is sensitive to concerns by air marshals and flight attendants about the rule changes , noting that they " would be the people upon whom the wounds would be inflicted			1
" " i do understand and respect their opposition , but from a security strategy point of view this is absolutely the right decision , " he said of the knife rule			0
" the air marshals and the flight attendants have legitimate concerns , certainly , for their own safety , but the threat of taking over a plane with a small , sharp instrument is zero , " @entity13 said			1
" you can not necessarily prevent violence on an airplane , but that is not the @entity14 's mission			2
@entity14 's mission is to prevent a successful , catastrophic terrorist attack , and you can not get a successful , catastrophic terrorist attack with a small knife or a wiffle ball bat			0

@entity13 says sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft
" clean up the checkpoint where officers are focusing on bombs and toxins , " he says
" you can commit acts of violence on an aircraft with what is allowed now , " he adds
