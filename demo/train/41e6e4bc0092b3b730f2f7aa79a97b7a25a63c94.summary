@entity0 -- @entity2 was not the best educated or the best dressed or even the best looking of the generation of @entity5 correspondents who dominated the early days of television news			1
his wife once told @entity8 that he looked , in a way , like your family dentist , which was not all that surprising since his father and his grandfather were dentists			0
yet @entity2 was picked in 1962 to anchor the " @entity16 , " and for two of the most tumultuous decades in @entity19 history , he was the authoritative voice of news in @entity19 , the man who told viewers that president @entity24 had been assassinated , that men had walked on the moon and that the @entity27 could n't be won			1
@entity28 , the historian whose new book " @entity2 " tells the newsman 's life story , said in an interview with @entity1 last week that the @entity34 - born reporter got picked for the @entity16 anchor job " because of his work ethic [ and ] steady - @entity39 appearance -- there was nothing dapper or elite about him			1
he spoke with a heartland cadence , and his timing was impeccable because he got most famous by doing @entity46 's three suborbits of the @entity47 -- that was early 1962 and by april of ' 62 , he was a household name			0
" @entity2 got off to a somewhat rocky start on the " @entity16 " when he closed the first broadcast , then only 15 minutes long , saying : " that 's the news			1
be sure to check your local newspapers tomorrow to get all of the details on the headlines we 're delivering to you			0
" @entity28 writes that @entity16 executives were angry that their anchorman was sending viewers to competitors for in - depth news			1
the next year , @entity16 was the first network to expand its nightly news to half an hour , a change that @entity28 says enabled @entity2 to get beyond the top headlines and start to set an agenda for news coverage of complex issues			1
in an era when television news was the province of the @entity75 broadcast networks and cable news had n't been invented yet , the anchor chair at @entity16 was an especially influential platform			1
1968 provided a remarkable sign of that			0
" 1968 is one of the most talked about years in @entity19 history because of all the upheaval , and @entity2 plays a central role in that year , right out of the gate , " @entity28 said			1
" he goes to @entity86 in january , early february of ' 68			0
by february 27 , he calls the war a stalemate			0
he then goes and urges @entity89 to run for president , then [ president @entity91 ] @entity91 says he wo n't seek re-election			0
then you have the assassinations of @entity95 [ @entity96 ] and @entity89 , which @entity2 covers			2
and then you 've got the conventions , and famously in @entity99 , where @entity2 's calling mayor @entity102 's police ' thugs ' and then [ @entity104 ] @entity103 winning in that strange three - way election with @entity106 and @entity107			1
" and then at the end of the year , " @entity28 added , the world saw " the first real great color photographs of @entity47 from space , and astronauts [ were ] named men of the year by @entity114 when @entity2 was the leading voice of space			1
@entity2 was all over everything in that seminal year , 1968			2
from that point on , his persona just kept growing and growing			0
" @entity28 dedicates his book in part to the late @entity122 , the @entity123 - winning journalist and author who he says suggested the idea of writing @entity2 's biography			1
his research was aided by the opening of the @entity2 papers at the @entity130 at the @entity131 in @entity132 and interviews with members of the @entity136 generation of journalists , including the late @entity138 and @entity139			2
" since the passing of @entity2 in 2009 , he 's become a part of history , he 's no longer an anchorman or a celebrity but somebody that we can reflect on and understand for his journalistic accomplishment , " @entity28 said			1
in @entity28 's account , @entity2 did n't equal the investigative zeal of the pioneering radio and television journalist @entity154 , with whom his relationship was at times strained			1
yet if @entity2 did n't reach the emotional peaks of some of @entity154 's reports , he still connected with the television viewer in a direct way			1
" everybody liked @entity2 , " @entity28 said			1
" he had a voice that everybody recognized			0
it 's like hearing @entity164 sing a song			0
... in five seconds everybody in @entity19 knows who 's talking			1
that 's important for a broadcaster			0
" " and then @entity2 slowed down his cadence , did n't rush his points			2
he also knew when to make the pregnant pause , when to be silent in special events			0
there was great anticipation : what will @entity2 say when @entity177 steps on the moon ? and @entity2 simply says , ' by golly , i 'm speechless , ' and that was better than having a contrived line			2
" in 1968 , after the @entity182 , @entity2 set the agenda for coverage of the @entity27			2
" @entity2 got up from his anchor desk , and flew to @entity86 , and put on a helmet and flak jacket , and interviewed anybody and everybody he could , " @entity28 said			1
" i was able to read his notebooks , his reporter 's notebooks , asking himself questions and talking to people , collecting facts			0
he came home with the very strong conclusion that war was unwinnable and that at best it would be a stalemate			0
and there were people on the left saying that and even great @entity204 reporters saying it , but to be @entity2 and be telling people that the war was at best a stalemate , it had a transformative effect on the country			2
people asked that old question , ' what , am i sending my son to die in a stalemate ? ' " he played a similar role in helping power the environmental movement			0
@entity28 said that @entity2 " was instrumental in the creation of the @entity218 because he created a segment [ which aired ] night after night called ' can we save the planet ? ' which would show rivers on fire and industrial pollution and clear cutting , in color on tv			1
" @entity2 sent television crews to cover the first @entity230 , and treated it as a giant event , television - worthy of an @entity233 mission			2
so when @entity2 started really banging the drum on the environment it had an impact			2
" as described in " @entity2 , " the anchorman comes across as a more complicated figure than many of his viewers could have seen			1
it was only after his retirement from the @entity16 anchor chair in 1981 that he gave full rein to his strongly liberal views : @entity28 refers to a 1988 speech that " planted him firmly in liberal - left soil			1
the charade of being mr. @entity130 was over			0
" his journalistic ethics were n't always stellar -- in the early 1970s , @entity28 writes , " @entity2 cut a deal with @entity254 airlines to fly the entire family to a series of international vacation spots			1
" his bosses objected , but as one network staffer noted , " @entity2 was the eight - hundred - pound gorilla in the @entity16 room			2
you could n't fire him			0
" the reason was his popularity with viewers			0
@entity28 noted that it 's especially difficult to come across as relaxed and comfortable , as if you 're in your living room , when you 're really in a cavernous television studio , with equipment and wires everywhere			1
" @entity2 was able to seem comfortable and real , " @entity28 said			1
the author attributes @entity2 's success to spending much of the early days of television , in the 1950s , in a wide variety of roles on programs , including game shows			1
" so when he caught his groove , it was as natural to him as breathing , being on the air			0
and he seldom said a wrong thing			0
he had very few retractions			0
and he never tried to break news first , he tried to break it right			0
" as an old wire service reporter , @entity2 wanted to get a story from @entity288 or the @entity289 before he would report breaking news on the air			2
" in that way , he was sort of playing like the tortoise for a long career			0
because you could go up in flames			0
one really bad report , one presentation of bogus information , could destroy an on - air personality 's career			2

@entity28 's new book is a full biography of @entity2
in era dominated by @entity75 networks , @entity2 was the leading anchorman
@entity19 experienced tumultuous developments of 1960s , ' 70s through @entity2
@entity28 : @entity2 had a gift for being comfortable on air and at the center of events
