-- tennis is ' likely ' to change one of its anti-doping rules after @entity4 received an 18 - month suspension for refusing to take a drug test at a tournament earlier this year			1
@entity4 was hit with the ban after he opted against giving a blood sample at the @entity10 in april , citing poor health			1
he provided a urine sample			2
the @entity13 claims the doping control officer on site allowed him to take the blood test the day after but the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) says that was n't the case			1
when he did take the blood test the following day , @entity4 said , it came back negative			1
@entity4 , who is taking his case to the @entity23 next week , said in a statement released tuesday that good friend and world no. 1 @entity25 was the first player to sign a petition demanding new rules at the " doping control station if there are problems			1
" the @entity17 said wednesday there would indeed probably be alterations next year to avoid any possible confusion			2
" the tennis anti-doping rules are likely to be changed in 2014 to say that , where a player refuses or fails to provide a sample ( as mr. @entity4 did ) , the doping control officer should try to offer the player an opportunity to speak to the event supervisor or referee to confirm the player 's responsibilities under the program , " @entity36 , the @entity17 's anti-doping manager , told @entity0			1
when asked if the change of thinking was due to the @entity4 affair , @entity36 added : " i think it 's fair to say that the @entity4 case highlighted the issue			1
" given this only happened in 2013 , i think it 's looking at the problem pretty quickly and trying to find a solution			2
" @entity4 , a former world no. 12 , said other players were " worried " in the wake of his suspension			2
" the players demand that the tournament supervisor or the @entity64 tour manager must be called to the doping control station if there are problems , " the 27 - year - old said			0
" no one should leave the room without providing samples if one of them has not been called			0
" the players are worried			0
what happened to me could have happened to them			0
" @entity0 was unable to verify if @entity25 signed any petition , although he told reporters at @entity78 's @entity77 in august : " we all give ( @entity4 ) big support because he 's definitely innocent			1
" @entity4 said he was " confident " ahead of his hearing in @entity81 , @entity82 on october 9			2
" i am fighting for the truth and i will do it as hard as i can , " he said			0
" i have done nothing wrong , apart from following the instructions of the doping control officer			0
" i really put all my hopes in the judges that will decide in @entity81			0
i hope they take their time and that they really find the truth			0
i do n't even want to think about anything else			0
