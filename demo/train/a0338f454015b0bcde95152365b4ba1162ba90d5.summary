@entity0 -- @entity0 's busy harbor is never short of action , but the great big yellow duck that floated into town on thursday captured the city 's attention			1
thousands lined the harbor front and work ground to a halt in offices with sea views as the much - hyped ' @entity14 ' made its grand entrance			2
for two weeks local media has been on something of a " duck watch , " closely monitoring the movements of the 16.5 - meter ( 54 feet ) inflatable sculpture			1
the man behind the seriously over-sized bath toy , @entity23 artist @entity21 , described the @entity0 response as overwhelming and said he was happy to have finally made it to the city , his first visit			1
" i 've wanted to come for years -- and my duck made it here before me ! " he quipped			1
the sunshine - yellow duck drew up beside @entity31 to the sound of a brass band and thousands of camera shutters			1
" @entity0 has been changed forever , " declared @entity21 as his inflatable friend lent a surreal air to the city 's iconic skyline			1
it 's a very well traveled duck			1
since it started on its global adventures , @entity14 has taken up temporary residence in cities all over the world , including @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			2
it will be in @entity0 's @entity48 until june 9			1
for children ? though it may be modeled on a child 's toy , this massive public art installation is n't just for kids			2
" i see it as an adult thing			2
it makes you feel young again			2
it refers to your childhood when there was no stress or economic pressure , no worry about having to pay the rent , " said @entity21			2
there were a lot of smiles and laughter as @entity14 made its splash but @entity21 says he does n't expect everyone to react with big grins			0
" if it makes you smile , then that 's ok , but maybe it makes you cry because of the urban environment			0
i make work not to give answers but to question things , " said the 36 - year - old father of three			0
@entity21 conceived the idea for the project in 2001			0
twelve years on his own reaction to @entity14 is no longer simple			0
" it 's getting complex because i have so many thoughts about it and so many minutes of talking and thinking about it , " he said			0
he urged everyone who can to get out and enjoy the free public art. " be amazed , be creative			0
look at it with your eyes and absorb the energy of the work in this location , " he said			0
next stop for @entity14 is the @entity98			1
the exact destination is a closely guarded secret			0
" i ca n't say , it 's confidential , " said @entity101			0
" in the @entity98 it will stay a secret until the last week			1
