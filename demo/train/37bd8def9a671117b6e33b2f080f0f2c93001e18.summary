-- one of @entity1 's controversial initiatives -- support for single - sex public schools and classes -- has come under heavy fire from critics			1
a common objection is that the programs are based on gender stereotypes : boys need discipline and should be free to run around the classroom ; girls require gentle care and can be trusted to sit still			1
is single - sex public education outdated and backward in this day and age ? sociologist @entity18 wrote in a @entity0 opinion column that single - sex classrooms in otherwise coeducational schools " segregate boys and girls			1
" it 's a powerful statement			0
@entity25 usually calls to mind racial segregation			0
in public schools today , black students remain considerably more segregated from white students compared with other racial and ethnic groups			1
but does separating students along the gender line , as @entity35 claims , do more harm than good ? separation is not always a form of segregation			1
some single - sex schools can do more good than harm			1
for educators who are looking for a way to address the needs of black boys -- who lag behind their peers on a range of academic and social measures , according to research -- single - sex education is an important tool			1
instead of abandoning the option , educators and policymakers should learn from the promising work of some of the schools that serve young black men			1
an all - male public school can celebrate many different ways of being a young man , freeing students from a straitjacket notion of masculinity			1
take @entity64 , a school that i researched for a year			2
( @entity64 is a pseudonym			0
federal guidelines require that its real name be kept confidential			0
this is a common practice for school - based research involving minors			1
) it 's an all - boys high school in a large urban school district on the @entity73			1
it opened several years ago			0
nearly all the boys there are @entity76 , and a large majority of their families are working - class or poor			1
opponents warn that single - sex schools reinforce gender stereotypes			1
it 's a valid concern			0
yet the teachers at @entity64 actively fought stereotypes , not simply of boys but of black boys			1
the school staff was well aware of common stereotypes of their young men -- as , say , rappers and basketball players -- and so the school culture nurtured individual interests and passions			2
at weekly assemblies , the accomplishments of the mock trial team were celebrated alongside those of the basketball team			0
there was a thriving comic book and anime club , and nearly the entire school turned out for theater productions			2
critics also worry that all - boys schools promote a machismo culture and could alienate boys who are gay			2
yet a schoolwide commitment to helping young men become gentlemen meant frequent lessons about respecting women and girls			0
the unique gender composition did not itself make all the difference			2
the school administration knew this from the start			2
as the school 's founder said , " you can make it all boys ; you can separate the boys			2
separation gives you an opportunity to work the boys			0
you 've got to shun the whole boot camp mentality , disciplinary school mentality			0
" that opportunity was creating a pro-academic climate with small class sizes and a longer school day			0
a large budget and buy - in from parents and teachers also helped tremendously			0
@entity64 's accomplishments ca n't be denied			0
since 2011 , the school has a near - perfect graduation rate , and over 80 % of the students have gone on to college			1
nearly all the boys i interviewed said they did n't want to be anywhere else ( and most had been unhappy when they enrolled )			0
they frequently cited the number of caring teachers			0
research has shown that single - sex schools serving at - risk youth are likely successful for reasons other than simply separating kids by gender			1
yet too often , opponents mischaracterize the claims made by those who support the schools			0
certainly , there are many differences among boys and among girls			0
but parents should have the option to choose between single - sex programs and coeducational options			1
( the programs must be completely voluntary , in keeping with 2006 @entity171 guidelines			0
) to be sure , proponents have n't always helped their own cause			0
some have mistakenly used biological sex differences to justify educating boys and girls separately			2
but @entity64 , for example , did n't tout those differences at all			0
the school instead cited very real , troubling and enduring differences in academic outcomes ( performance in school , graduation rates ) and social outcomes ( exposure to drugs and violence , the likelihood of being incarcerated ) between black boys and their peers			1
let 's stop saying that single - sex public education is a form of segregation ; it can empowering			1
and @entity76 - @entity76 boys are among those who could benefit the most			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			2

@entity202 says support for single - sex public education has come under fire
@entity208 : single - sex classes are a good option in addressing the needs of black boys
he says an all - male school can free students from a narrow idea of masculinity
@entity208 : not all single - sex programs reinforce gender stereotypes
