@entity0 -- a federal judge has blocked key parts of a @entity5 law that would require doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion , days before the law was set to take effect			1
@entity13 district judge @entity12 , in @entity14 , @entity5 , found that several portions of the law are " unconstitutionally vague , " and that it violates the @entity17 by compelling doctors and patients to engage in government - mandated speech			1
as written , the law would require women seeking an abortion in @entity5 to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure			1
it was to take effect on september 1			1
the preliminary injunction , issued tuesday , blocks the state from enforcing any penalties against a doctor who does not place sonogram pictures where a pregnant woman may see them , or does not make the heartbeat audible			0
it also blocks penalties against the woman			0
" today 's ruling is a huge victory for women in @entity5 and a clear signal to the state legislature that it went too far when it passed this law , " said @entity44 , president and ceo of the @entity46			1
" politicians have no business telling doctors how to practice medicine or meddling in women 's private medical decisions			1
" the @entity46 filed the lawsuit , which was granted class - actions status			0
@entity63 and @entity65 presidential hopeful @entity64 said the state would appeal the decision			0
" every life lost to abortion is a tragedy and ( the ) ruling is a great disappointment to all @entity74 who stand in defense of life , " he said in a statement			0
" this important sonogram legislation ensures that every @entity5 woman seeking an abortion has all the facts about the life she is carrying , and understands the devastating impact of such a life - changing decision			0
" the bill stirred some controversy in @entity5 , but it easily passed through the @entity86 and @entity87 , both of which are controlled by @entity65			0
the law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed , women must undergo a sonogram , a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image			2
the doctor , then , is required to give , " in a manner understandable to a layperson , a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images , including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus , the presence of cardiac activity , and the presence of external members and internal organs , " the law states			2
in his order , @entity113 agreed with the abortion providers that many clauses in the law were too vague			2
he wrote , " the court is inclined to agree with ( the ) defendants ' characterization that ( the ) " plaintiffs have chosen to throw everything at the wall and hope something sticks			0
" the court also found that the sonogram law goes beyond existing informed consent laws regarding abortion and constituted a violation of the @entity17			1
the law " compels physicians to advance an ideological agenda with which they may not agree , regardless of any medical necessity , and irrespective of whether the pregnant women wish to listen , " @entity113 wrote .			2

a judge ruled that doctors can not be penalized for not showing images to women
the law was to go into effect september 1
the judge found some of the language unconstitutionally vague
he also said that it violated the @entity17
