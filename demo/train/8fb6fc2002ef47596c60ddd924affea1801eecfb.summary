-- the @entity2 artist @entity1 makes sculptures out of felted wool that are , like her , desperately playful and mad			1
" i like to make wool do impossible things , to turn it from something soft to something hard , " says the artist whose blog is called " we are all angry			1
" @entity1 's latest creations were on exhibit at @entity16 in @entity17 in march			1
" @entity22 " included everyday objects , from a brick - sized white aspirin to a matchbook with only a single , middle - finger match			1
at the heart of her life and art is a childlike sincerity			2
the 40 - year - old former director of an aftercare program sees people as full of troubled stories but essentially worth connecting to			1
@entity1 is part of the " indie craft " generation whose slow , repetitive work is an antidote to and comment on today 's fast - paced world			1
their work is featured in magazines like " make " and " @entity42 " and the documentary " @entity43			2
" she also has a shop on @entity47			2
even before her creative career took off , @entity1 simplified her life and identity by changing her name to her nickname			1
she tried many crafts before stumbling , through a children 's workshop , on feltmaking			1
like a crayon , felt is a colorful , harmless material reminiscent of childhood			1
turning airy tresses of bright wool into a flat sheet of felt came easy to her and evoked her sense of play			1
" what would happen if i ... ? " she asked herself , then started poking " a bajillion times			2
" finally the wool formed into a solid , sculptured mass of fiber			1
" each poke , you are deciding what the piece will be and mean , " she said			2
" there is a lot of possibility in the slowness and simplicity of the tool			2
" she chatted with @entity0			0
following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : how does your personal story , growing up as a " @entity86 marshmallow in northern @entity87 , " influence your art ? @entity1 : talk about a clash of wealth and status			1
back when @entity95 ( outside @entity96 ) had a poor section , i grew up in tiny crap houses next to the wealthiest people in @entity87			0
i come from a working - class family with complicated family dynamics			1
in the last five years i lost both my parents , which is not exactly a tsunami tragedy , but it 's powerful stuff when you 've had a complicated relationship			1
i did an embroidery piece from the perspective of being behind a crowded street with a lot of people			0
that was about my parents			0
you never stop missing your parents			0
you never stop knowing life is different when they are gone			0
but life is so enriched with that knowledge , too			0
their deaths really focused me as a working person to ask why we are here on this planet			0
i do n't think it 's to say yes to people who want us to do the wrong things			1
we all have a complicated back story and i 'm sure it 's there in my work			1
@entity0 : your " hunger " series ( priced $ 80 to $ 400 each ) featured doll parts being gobbled up by felted aliens			1
what was that about ? @entity1 : there is a whimsy and desperate nature and a shameful feeling to some of those creatures			1
it is just about my feelings about humanity -- embracing it and also being repelled			0
( when ) every question i could answer poses for me more questions			0
that 's when i know my piece is working			1
@entity0 : how did working with children influence you ? @entity1 : i was teaching an after - school program for 65 kids and hiring artists to come in once a week to teach them			1
i learned along with them when i hired @entity165 , a ( flat ) needle felter			1
... i was like someone playing with a new toy , getting some satisfaction from the look , feel and whimsy of it			1
i started wondering what would happen if i made up stories for myself and made 3 - d finger puppets to tell my story			2
no one else had done anything like that with felt			2
if someone gave me clay at the same time , would it have been the same transformational effect ? i do n't know			0
it 's hard to say what your own outliers are			2
@entity0 : what 's your technique ? @entity1 : wool , like every animal hair , has scales up and down each fiber			1
my industrial felting needle has notches on it			0
when i poke it into the wool , the needle opens and shuts the scales so they lock like @entity202			2
basically the wool is my clay and the needle is my fingertips			2
i poke it where i want it to indent			0
i add more wool where i want to build shape			2
@entity0 : is that connecting of fibers a metaphor for the connection you want your art to make ? @entity1 : i believe in the high five			1
everyone has a context , a history that no one can know like you know your own			0
i look for the opportunity every day to celebrate , in a spontaneous and deliberate way , to laugh with someone in a grocery line about something funny that happens or to give someone change for a dollar			0
i 'll offer to high five you			0
i 'm not a special ed kid or anything			0
i just believe in the potential of people			0
my day will only be what i make it , and i look for ways to feel human every day			0
one way is to connect to you			0
i encourage everyone to try it			0
@entity0 : how does doubt and fear influence you ? @entity1 : more than anything else , i 've mastered the ability to ignore the voice in my head that tells me i do n't know how to do anything			1
some people call it the lizard brain , and it never goes away			0
i 've learned to just do it anyway -- not that i 'm not afraid			2
@entity0 : do you listen to or watch anything while felting ? @entity1 : i ca n't watch films that are important to me , like any cinematography			1
i do n't watch tv			0
i listen to podcasts like " @entity263 : a journal of @entity265 , " " @entity266 , " and " @entity267			0
" a relatively new one , " back to @entity270 , " is about productivity and creative process			0
it 's about how to stop getting distracted by people teaching you not to be distracted , and putting your butt in the chair			2
i also love " @entity278 , " because i 'm an old - school stand - up comedy nerd and @entity276 , the host , is really smart and complicatedly broken			1
he interviews his colleagues and sometimes talks about how broken they are			0
that is white hot , really good			0
@entity1 published an instructional book , " @entity283 " ( @entity284 ) in 2010 .			1
