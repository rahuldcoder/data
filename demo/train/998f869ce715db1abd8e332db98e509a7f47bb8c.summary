-- the fatal gang rape of a young woman in the @entity4 capital of @entity5 sparked weeks of angry protests and prompted heated debates about the pervasiveness of sexual violence in @entity4 society			1
@entity0 asked people in @entity4 and the @entity4 diaspora for their thoughts on the case and the subsequent charges brought against six people , and also asked women for their personal experiences			1
responses ranged from anger at the system , which they feel failed the young woman who died , to recollections of the harassment they have suffered personally			0
" i have been hooted at , i 've been called names and told to dress modestly , and let me remind you this is from people my own age and not older conservative people , " said charity consultant @entity27 from @entity28			0
ireporter : rape ' still not seen as a human rights violation in @entity4 ' " this girl could have been me , it could have been any of my friends and no - one would have taken us seriously			1
" proposals to install " fast track " courts for rape cases marked a promising start , she said , but she added that it would take more than just statutes to stop such tragedies			0
violence against women in @entity4 is widespread			1
more than 220,000 incidents were reported in 2011 alone , according to @entity4 government statistics			1
human rights activists point out that , due to under reporting , the real figure is most likely much higher			0
but it 's not just the statistics -- it 's the mindset , many @entity4 said			1
following the attack , there was further outrage when the @entity4 president 's son , @entity61 , dismissed women who had flocked to the streets to protest against the case as " dented and painted , " comments for which he later apologized			1

" there is a sexist mindset , politicians have made silly remarks about women and how they should wear modest clothes , not go to parties , " @entity27 said			0
" if they make the laws how will it benefit us ? people have to change the way they think			0
" despite such comments making headlines , many @entity4 men were quick to express their outrage at the attack			1
@entity89 , a software engineer from @entity28 , attended some of the protests and candlelight vigils that erupted in @entity4 cities after reports of the case emerged in local media			1
he said he had felt " ashamed " as a man to hear the news and called for a shift in attitudes towards women and how they are treated			0
ireporter : ' i 'm ashamed as a man in my own country ' " harsher punishment will stop a case here and there , but that will not change our mind set , " he said			0
" when will our conscience overpower our instincts ? " @entity115 , an artist and writer from @entity4 now living in @entity117 , @entity118 , said that for the first time in @entity4 's history , " we 're realizing that we can not protect our women by hiding them behind tradition and values			1
" @entity4 , he said , was experiencing a schism between a value system that relied on shutting women away to one where external forces such as the police and the criminal justice system were looked to for support and justice			2
" for centuries , @entity4 protected its women against such crimes by hiding [ them ] behind strict rules of personal fashion and even stricter traditions , " he said			2
" now , urban @entity4 look -- as the @entity139 does -- to its laws and policing to protect its women			2
what we 're seeing is clash of those opposing cultures			0
" more : ' @entity4 has woken up and realized that change is needed ' nonetheless , he was also quick to point out that @entity4 is far from the only country with endemic sexual violence			2
" rapes are crimes of opportunity that occur in every corner of the world , not just @entity4 , " he said			2
five of the suspects were formally charged on thursday with the murder , rape and kidnapping in a @entity5 court , senior police officials said , while another is awaiting age tests to determine if he is old enough to be tried in an adult court			1
several of the charges carry the death penalty if they are convicted			0
there are hopes amongst @entity4 that the potent mix of public anger , political nervousness and global pressure may impress on authorities the need for action to prevent such crimes happening again			2
the sheer horror of the case has also increased calls from some protesters for use of the death penalty , which is legal but rarely used in @entity4			1
images of angry demonstrators carrying mock hangman 's nooses and signs calling for the suspects to be killed have left little doubt that there are some in @entity4 keen for this sentence to be carried out if the men are convicted			2
others , however , were more circumspect , citing sanctity for life , or the possibility of rehabilitation or change			0
" i believe rape is the most grave crime as the victims die two times , once physically and one emotionally , so the [ suspects ] must be given severe punishment [ if convicted ] which can make them realize how painful it is , " said @entity201 from @entity202 , northern @entity4 , on @entity203			1
" but i think we should abandon capital punishment			0
every human being has the capacity [ to ] transform themselves into a good , law abiding citizen			0
" more : remembering the @entity5 gang rape victim the sheer tragedy of the case has also prompted some outside of @entity4 to take action , from sharing thoughts and condolences on social media to organizing vigils in honor of the unnamed victim			1
@entity229 , a media specialist living in @entity230 , @entity231 , whose family comes from @entity5 , decided to organize a vigil after her tweets about the case sparked an outpouring of emotional responses and pleas to take action			1
" people were saying ' you work in media -- you can do something ! ' " she said			0
" so i decided to put together a vigil in my home town			0
" " a lot of people want to pay their respects and show solidarity for this woman who died in such a traumatic way			0
hopefully now @entity4 women will feel more empowered to speak out			2
