@entity0 -- supporters of an @entity4 opposition group claimed thursday they have information about another secret facility tied to the @entity4 government 's nuclear program			1
according to @entity10 , an @entity4 - @entity11 with ties to the @entity13 , the facility is at a site referred to as @entity15 , just west of @entity16 , and is designed to manufacture parts for centrifuges used to enrich uranium , a key component for civilian nuclear power as well as for nuclear weapons			1
a @entity11 official who is not authorized to speak on the record said the @entity11 is aware of the facility			1
@entity10 told reporters at a news conference that over the past four and a half years the plant has produced enough parts to make more than 100,000 centrifuges , well beyond the needs for the nuclear facilities declared by the @entity4 government to international monitors			1
he also maintained the site is under the control and supervision of the @entity37			0
the @entity38 , which monitors nuclear activities on behalf of the @entity40 , has inspected @entity4 's declared enrichment facilities , but @entity4 does not provide details or access to sites where nuclear components are made			0
@entity46 , another supporter of the @entity13 , said the @entity15 site comprises three main warehouses over an area of nearly 48,000 square meters , or nearly 12 acres			2
she said the essential parts manufactured there include casings , magnets , molecular pumps , composite tubes , bellows and centrifuge bases			0
although satellite photos were shown of the site , no direct evidence was provided other than to say the information was from members of the @entity61 's @entity13 organization inside @entity4			1
the same group was the first to provide the details that publicly exposed the existence of @entity4 's clandestine nuclear program in 2002			0
@entity4 claims its nuclear program is for civilian energy needs , but the @entity11 and other nations maintain @entity4 is working to develop fissile material for nuclear weapons			2
the @entity38 said in its most recent report , in february , that @entity4 continues to stonewall the inspectors by not providing sufficient information or access to its facilities for inspectors to determine the ultimate purpose of @entity4 's nuclear program			0
former nuclear inspector @entity79 , who has closely followed developments concerning @entity4 's nuclear exploits , said he had no information about whether @entity15 is in fact a secret nuclear site			2
but he did question the claim that @entity4 has enough parts to make 100,000 centrifuges			1
" there is no way @entity4 has made components for 100,000 centrifuges , " said @entity91 , adding , " it runs contrary to all indications that @entity4 has a shortage of raw materials			0
" according to @entity91 , @entity4 has indicated it wants to have 50,000 centrifuges and has so far manufactured 12,000 to 15,000 of them			0
@entity91 believes there is a political motivation behind the @entity4 opposition 's claims that leads to exaggeration			0
he said the opposition supporters challenge international sanctions as a way to highlight their goal of getting the @entity11 to remove the @entity13 from its list of foreign terrorist organizations			2
at the news conference , @entity10 -- saying that " the revelations today show the policy pursued by the @entity11 has not been productive in halting the nuclear program of @entity4 " -- maintained that only a democratic @entity4 will succeed in eliminating the nuclear program , and that the best chance for democracy lies with the @entity11 removing the @entity13 from its terrorist list .			1

an @entity117 with ties to the @entity13 announces the find
he says @entity4 uses the site to make parts for centrifuges used to enrich uranium
the @entity11 is aware of the facility , a @entity11 official tells @entity1
