this week , the @entity1 @entity0 issued its long - awaited guideline on lung cancer screening			1
they recommend annual screening for lung cancer with low - dose computed tomography ( @entity9 ) in adults ages 55 to 80 who are at high risk for lung cancer because they have smoked a pack or more per day of cigarettes for at least 30 years and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years			1
low - dose @entity9 is an imaging technology involving low doses of radiation			0
this is important news , as 160,000 @entity1 die of lung cancer every year			1
it is estimated that this test could eventually prevent between 8,000 and 22,000 lung cancer deaths per year			1
about 85 % of lung cancers are due to cigarette smoking ; 37 % of @entity1 are current or former smokers and 20 % still smoke			1
the task force , an independent group of experts , makes evidence - based recommendation on preventive services like screenings , preventive medications and counseling services			2
they are highly respected among screening and preventive medicine experts			2
their process for developing guidelines involves an extensive review of scientific studies , issuing of a draft guideline for public input and publishing a final recommendation			2
the task force advises the @entity1 @entity47			1
the @entity48 mandates that health insurance cover screenings the task force deems useful			0
this latest recommendation is largely based on the @entity52 's @entity51			0
this study , which began in 2001 , is one of the best - designed screening studies conducted on any cancer			1
stigma lingers for deadliest cancer the task force recommendation is similar to the lung screening guidelines issued by other organizations because of the quality of this trial			1
these organizations include the @entity63 , the @entity64 , the @entity65 , the @entity66 , the @entity67 and the @entity68 ( for which i work )			0
disagreements exist in prostate and breast cancer screening recommendations because of flaws in all major prostate and breast screening trials			2
the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) assessed more than 54,000 smokers and showed screening caused a 20 % decline in lung cancer deaths eight to 10 years later			1
this means 80 % of lung cancer deaths still occurred			1
also , smoking - induced cardiovascular disease kills far more people than lung cancer			1
smoking also causes a number of other serious diseases , including bronchitis , emphysema and at least 11 other cancers			0
all current lung cancer screening recommendations note that the patient needs to understand the risks and benefits of screening and decide if it is right for them			1
there are definite harms associated with lung cancer screening			1
more than one in four people screened will have a finding that leads to further testing			0
ultimately , 24 out of 25 who get further testing will not have lung cancer			1
additional testing can include more x-ray testing as well as invasive tests such as biopsies and surgeries			0
a small proportion of patients getting additional testing will have permanent disabilities or even die as a result			0
in the @entity51 , roughly one person died after an invasive procedure triggered by screening for every five to six lives saved because of screening			0
studies also show that some people will have an " overdiagnosis cancer " -- that is , a cancer that would never progress and kill			0
it is still difficult for many of us in medicine to accept that there are cancers that do not need treatment			0
this is a relatively new phenomenon due to improvements in imaging and diagnostics			0
nicotine in e-cigs , tobacco linked to heart disease there is currently no good test to determine who has a cancer that needs treatment and who has a cancer that does not need treatment , therefore some screen - detected patients will receive treatment that is not needed to save their life			0
the @entity51 was conducted in 33 of the finest hospitals in the @entity1			2
these hospitals were chosen for their specific expertise in radiology , pulmonary medicine , thoracic surgery , and medical and radiation oncology			0
many health care centers will have to work to ensure they have the appropriate equipment and skills to provide screening			0
just as with the introduction of mammography for breast cancer screening , it may take years for these skills to be available throughout the country			2
this is a test for relatively heavy smokers			2
we need a screening test for nonsmokers and light smokers			2
about one in six people who develop lung cancer are nonsmokers			1
unfortunately , studies suggest that there is not great benefit to low - dose spiral ct screening in these populations , but many of the potential harms remain			0
patients who smoke or who have smoked cigarettes should talk to their doctor about whether low - dose spiral ct is a good test for them			0
most importantly , do not use lung cancer screening as a reason to continue smoking , as all science to date tells us there is greater benefit in quitting .			1

160,000 @entity1 die of lung cancer every year
a new recommendation encourages screening of heavy current or former smokers
the screening is not without hazards , however
