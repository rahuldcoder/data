the nation 's 44,000 airport screeners would lose the title " officer , " their metal badges and maybe even the stripes down their pant legs under a bill sponsored by a @entity5 critic			1
called the " @entity10 , " for " stop @entity5 's @entity11 , " the bill was introduced by rep. @entity13 , @entity14 , on thursday in response to a series of alleged strip searches by @entity5 officers			1
the @entity5 denies that strip searches were conducted			1
" @entity20 has sat idly by as the @entity5 strip - searches 85 - year - old grandmothers in @entity22 , pats down 3 - year - olds in @entity24 , and checks colostomy bags for explosives in @entity28			1
enough is enough ! , " @entity29 said in a statement			0
" the least we can do is end this impersonation , which is an insult to real cops			0
" the bill , which has 25 co-sponsors , would prohibit airport screeners from using the title " officer " and would ban them from wearing a metal badge resembling a police badge or a uniform resembling that of a federal law enforcement officer unless they receive law enforcement training			1
when the @entity5 was formed after the 2001 terrorist attacks , screeners wore white shirts with embroidered patches			0
but in 2005 , the @entity5 reclassified screeners as " transportation security officers , " and in 2007 introduced new uniforms in an effort to professionalize the workforce and boost morale			1
in 2008 , metal badges were added to the uniform			0
at the time , the association representing federal law enforcement officers opposed the badges , saying that they would mislead the public into believing the screeners had traditional police powers			1
transportation security officers are unarmed , do not have arrest powers and can not use force , the association said			2
but the association on friday opposed the changes			0
" i think it is wrong to strip away the title			1
it 's not the screener 's fault , " said @entity72 , president of the @entity73			2
" i think the bill in @entity20 should focus not so much on taking away a title but in assuring that the training and experience support the title			2
the answer is to build upon it ; do n't strip it away			0
" the union representing screeners called the bill an insult			2
" every single member of @entity20 should be supporting federal employees , not trying to demean them , " said @entity89 , president of the @entity90			0
@entity29 , ( @entity95 rep. @entity94 and their other cohorts in the @entity97 need to stop bullying the @entity5 workforce , and maybe just worry about doing their own jobs , " @entity89 said			0
" instead of actually helping to fight terrorism , " he said , " they are inspiring the type of unnecessary and disrespectful behavior by a few members of the public with an agenda that in fact diverts attention from securing @entity111 skies			0

rep. @entity13 's *proposal* is in reaction to alleged strip searches
the bill also would take away the title " officer " and police - like uniforms
this is the wrong way to go , the chief of the federal law officers ' union says
