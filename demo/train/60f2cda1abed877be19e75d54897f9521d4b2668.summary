@entity1 a @entity1 housewife has been found guilty of imprisoning and abusing a young @entity4 maid whose case has prompted protests and calls for reform of the city 's laws governing domestic workers			1
over several months last year , @entity12 was kept as a prisoner in the home of @entity15 , a 44 - year - old mother of two who regularly deprived her of food , sleep and payment for long hours of grueling work			1
after the verdict , @entity12 thanked her supporters and called for the governments of @entity1 and @entity4 to do more to protect the rights of migrant workers			1
" what i hope together with my fellow domestic workers are just fair and humane treatment and for people to stop treating us like slaves , " she said			2
law was convicted of grievous bodily harm , common assault , and failing to pay @entity12 's wages or give her statutory rest days			1
sentencing has been deferred until february 27 to give the defense time to compile character references and psychological reports			2
in delivering her verdict , judge @entity41 described the 23 - year - old victim as " a simple young lady who tried to financially better her life and that of her family			0
" she said @entity12 had no reason to fabricate the evidence , and that the abuse had been so frequent and over such a long period of time , it was reasonable that the young maid might not be able to recall specific dates			1
@entity41 said @entity12 thought she was under surveillance at all times , and believed @entity33 's threats that her family would be killed if she told anyone about the abuse			1
" they made her compliant and more subservient , " @entity41 said			0
@entity12 started work in @entity33 's home in may 2013			1
however , within one month she tried to escape because she had n't been paid her wages			2
the court heard she called the building 's security guard who contacted her agency			0
later , an @entity4 woman turned up and took her back to the flat , saying there was no need to find a new employer			0
that 's when the physical abuse started			0
it began with punches , then progressed to beatings with a mop handle , coat hangers , and the rod from a vacuum cleaner			0
by the following january , she had become too weak to work and was escorted to the airport with a one - way ticket by her employer , who told her to wear a diaper because she was too ill to stand			1
" ( @entity33 ) asked me to put on six layers of clothes and two pairs of pants , " @entity12 told the court			1
" she also asked me to wear @entity92 because i was unable to go to the toilet because i was very weak			2
she put make up on me so i do n't look like someone who 'd just been tortured			0
" she also repeated threats to kill her parents if she told anyone of the abuse , @entity12 said			1
even before the trial , @entity12 's case became a cause celebre for campaigners who say that @entity1 rules dictating that domestic workers reside at their employers ' homes expose hundreds of thousands of foreign workers -- mostly women -- to potential abuse			1
last april , @entity12 was named by @entity110 as one of the world 's 100 most influential people , which commended her bravery for drawing attention to " the plight of a vulnerable often invisible population			1
" the @entity1 government started allowing foreign domestic helpers to work in the @entity122 territory in the 1970s to fill a shortage of local staff			2
now , around 320,000 come here from @entity4 and the @entity125 , as well as other @entity127 countries , to earn more money than they could at home			2
many who come via agencies direct from their home countries do n't meet their employer before signing a two - year contract requiring them to live and work in their homes			1
they 're paid a minimum wage of hk $ 4,110 ( $ 530 ) a month and by law are only entitled to one day off a week			0
after the verdict , @entity143 said the case should serve as a " wake - up call " for the government to stop the " widespread exploitation " of domestic workers			0
" the @entity1 authorities can no longer bury their heads in the sand and dismiss horrific abuses as isolated incidents , " said @entity150 , @entity143 's @entity151 migrant rights researcher			0
@entity143 says workers are under pressure to stay in abusive situations because @entity1 law demands they leave the city within two weeks of terminating their contract , if they ca n't find a new job			0
during the trial , @entity12 told the court the only time she was allowed to rest was between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. she was made to clean doors at 3 a.m. , she said , so the neighbors did n't see her			1
desperately hungry , on one occasion she said she knocked on a neighbor 's door and asked for food			0
@entity12 said @entity33 's children overheard and told their mother who then threatened her again			1
@entity12 slept on the floor , moving the vacuum cleaner and bags of books to make room to lie down when permitted			1
by day , she was so tired that on at least one occasion she fell asleep while doing the vacuuming			0
her employer , @entity33 , grabbed the vacuum , she said , and shoved it in her mouth , twisting it so the metal tube cut her lips and her " mouth was bleeding			0
" another time when she fell asleep while vacuuming , @entity12 said @entity33 stripped her in the bathroom and sprayed her with cold water			1
when the water was turned off , she was forced to stand naked in front of a fan			0
after one to two hours , she was allowed to dress and resume work , the court heard			2
law and @entity12 were not the only ones living in the flat during the abuse			1
@entity33 's two children -- her 18 - year - old son @entity204 wing - kit and 16 - year - old daughter referred to only as " @entity208 " to protect her identity -- provided no evidence against their mother			0
@entity204 testified that she was " gentle " to maids			0
his sister said she did n't pay much attention			2
@entity12 said @entity33 's husband was never there and she had only seen old wedding photos of him in the flat			1
during questioning by the defense , @entity12 became upset when it was suggested she was making up the threats			1
why did n't she call for help ? @entity12 said it was because she was n't let out , her passport had been taken , and she feared that @entity33 would make good on her threats to kill her family			1
she tried to escape twice ; both attempts failed			0
her employer watched her every move , she said , even on @entity228 via her mobile phone when she was n't there			0
@entity4 maid says she was tortured with vacuum cleaner two other domestic workers were involved in the case , who alleged they too were the victims of assault and criminal intimidation while working in @entity33 's home			1
judge @entity41 found law guilty of assaulting and threatening @entity241 sometime between april 2010 and march 2011			2
however , she found @entity33 not guilty of the same offenses against another domestic worker , @entity243 , dating back to late 2011			2
despite abuses , foreign domestic workers still flock to @entity1 when @entity12 's employer escorted her to the airport in early january 2014 , other @entity4 women noticed her condition and pressed her to tell them what had happened			1
one of them , @entity252 , told @entity253 tried to blame her scarred and blackened skin on allergies , before admitting , " i was tortured			0
" @entity12 's claims led to protests in @entity1 , demands for justice and calls for the law to be changed to allow domestic foreign workers to live outside their employers ' home			1
after the verdict , @entity12 said she would n't be returning to @entity1 and to her former life as a maid			2
" my body is not as strong anymore			0
being a domestic helper is heavy work that needs strength and energy , " she said			2
she said she 's been offered a scholarship to a private university and plans to finish school , with the aim of helping other victims of abuse			0
" i have a dream of putting up a foundation that will help other migrant workers , " she said			0
