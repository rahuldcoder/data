@entity0 -- the clock is ticking in @entity5 on the bipartisan super committee , those 12 members of @entity3 tasked with finding at least $ 1.2 trillion in deficit reduction by @entity8			1
more than 140 of their colleagues , both @entity9 and @entity10 , are encouraging them to be bold and go bigger -- reaching $ 4 trillion of deficit reduction in order to put the @entity14 on stable long - term fiscal footing and avoid another round of downgrades			1
but if their colleagues ' counsel is n't persuasive , there 's an additional voice the super committee could find inspiration from -- the original founding father , @entity5			1
in his farewell address to his fellow countrymen in 1796 , @entity5 set out his lessons for future generations			2
it was penned as the " warnings of a parting friend , " and in it , @entity5 laid out the long - term dangers that his understanding of history and human nature dictated could undermine the independence of our democratic republic			2
@entity5 warned about the dangers of what we would today call hyper - partisans : " they serve to organize faction , to give it an artificial and extraordinary force ; to put , in the place of the delegated will of the nation , the will of a party , often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community			1
" these platoons of polarization have driven us to the paralysis we are now in , too often unable to reason together even in the face of crisis			0
crucially , @entity5 understood that out - of - control debt could undermine @entity14 independence			1
he warned that we must " cherish public credit ... avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt , not only by shunning occasions of expense , but by vigorous exertion in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned , not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear			2
" put on your decoder rings and you 'll see that @entity5 's wisdom could have referred to our own time			1
after all , much -- though certainly not all -- of the deficits and debts accumulated over the past decade came from two foreign wars			0
the @entity84 war was necessary in retaliation for the attacks of 9/11 -- but the war in @entity88 , as we now know , was far from " unavoidable " -- it was a war of choice			2
moreover , as sen. @entity91 and others pointed out , it was the first time in @entity14 history that we did not raise revenues in order to pay for wars			1
instead we cut taxes and turned a hard - won surplus into a deficit , which grew exponentially after the stimulus bill under president @entity101			1
@entity5 understood that dealing with debts was government 's responsibility , but leaders would be unlikely to make unpopular choices in a democracy unless the public was both enlightened and understanding : " the execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives , " he said -- meaning the members of @entity3			1
" but it is necessary that public opinion should co-operate			0
to facilitate to them the performance of their duty , it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must be revenue ; that to have revenue there must be taxes ; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant			1
" in other words , man up and deal with math. paying down debts means raising revenue as well as cutting costs			0
it is a basic profit and loss ledger			0
whining endlessly about taxes ignores their central role in securing our civilization			2
so sayeth not some commie hippie but @entity5 himself			0
that speaks to the impasse the super committee is at right now -- whether to include any revenue increases to pay down the deficit and the debt			1
outright tax increases -- even restoring the @entity154 tax rates on people who make more than a million dollars a year -- is apparently not on the table right now			2
more ambitious tax reform is seen as a bridge too far given the limited time frame left			2
nonetheless , there are some slight signs of progress			0
sen. @entity163 -- former president of the @entity164 -- deserves credit for recently saying he was open to revenue increases , albeit combined with the reduction of the top tax rate from 35 to 28 percent			1
this was met with some derision from @entity9 who are increasingly hearing from their constituents that the growing gap between the rich and poor in the nation is unsustainable			0
@entity9 have more readily crossed their partisan @entity175 , offering support for modest entitlement reforms as a way of bending the long - term cost curve			0
the most hopeful declaration of independence that has occurred in recent weeks is the growing number of @entity10 willing to break ranks with anti-tax absolutists			0
they are putting the @entity186 over the no - tax pledge advanced by conservative activist @entity188			1
" there is a lot of talk about pledges , " @entity190 @entity189 rep. @entity189 said			0
" it 's time to put the pledges in a bonfire			1
" in some ways what we face now is a choice between @entity5 and the @entity201 of the world			0
it is a choice between the long - term national interest and the short - term special interest			2
the goals are clear and the path is known			0
we have the @entity208 , the @entity209 and the @entity210 plans to look at			0
we now have a gang of 140 members of @entity3 from both parties encouraging the super committee to be bold and go big			1
while reaching $ 1.2 trillion in deficit reduction is far better than the automatic cuts to defense and discretionary spending that will take place if the super committee fails , it alone can not be regarded as a success			1
it is a stay of execution			0
because we 'll be right back at the negotiating table in a few months , trying to forestall yet another downgrade			0
as the clocks ticks closer to the deadline , the super committee should have the words of @entity5 's farewell address echoing in their heads , adding to their sense of urgency , determining not to ungenerously throw " upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear			1
" if they are driven by such a sense of generational responsibility , they can declare independence from their respective special interests , forge a constructive compromise and present a balanced bipartisan plan that serves the national interest			0
they have it in their power to put patriotism over partisanship -- we are waiting to see if they have the will			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity256 .			2
