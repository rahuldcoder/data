" our investigation found that @entity15 participated in a pattern of corrupt conduct for years , " said @entity9 rep. @entity8 , @entity10 , chairman of the @entity11 on @entity12			1
" litigants have the right to expect a judge hearing their case will be fair and impartial , and avoid even the appearance of impropriety			0

" after the impeachment vote , @entity8 and rep. @entity28 , @entity29 , were named the lead impeachment managers for the @entity33 trial , which will decide whether to remove @entity15 from the bench			1
" today 's vote marks only the second time in over 20 years that this has occurred , " @entity28 said in a @entity2 news release			1
" however , when evidence emerges that an individual is abusing his judicial office for his own advantage , the integrity of the entire judicial system becomes compromised			0
" in a statement , @entity15 ' lawyer @entity44 said the @entity46 had decided not to prosecute because it did not have credible evidence			2
" unfortunately , the @entity2 has decided to disregard the @entity46 's decision and to move forward with impeachment			2
as a result , we will now turn to the @entity33 to seek a full and fair hearing of all of the evidence			0
" in a telephone interview , @entity44 said he did not know when the @entity33 trial would be held			0
" there are no clear rules that dictate timing , " he said			0
last year , the @entity11 on @entity12 held evidentiary hearings that led to unanimous approval of the four articles of impeachment , citing evidence that @entity15 " intentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury , engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme , solicited and accepted unlawful gifts , and intentionally misled the @entity33 during his confirmation proceedings , " the @entity2 release said			1
@entity15 was appointed to the federal bench in 1994			2
in 2007 , after an @entity74 and federal grand jury investigation , the @entity46 alleged " pervasive misconduct " by @entity15 and evidence " that @entity15 may have violated federal and state criminal laws , controlling canons of judicial conduct , rules of professional responsibility , and conducted himself in a manner antithetical to the constitutional standard of good behavior required of all federal judges			1
" the complaint said the department opted not to seek criminal charges for reasons that included issues of statute of limitations and other factors			0
but @entity44 said the statute of limitations was not applicable			0
an @entity97 held four hearings late last year that focused on allegations of misconduct by @entity15 , including : -- involvement in a corrupt kickback scheme -- failure to recuse himself from a case he was involved in -- allegations that @entity15 made false and misleading statements , including concealing debts and gambling losses -- allegations that @entity15 asked for and accepted " numerous things of value , including meals , trips , home and car repairs , for his personal use and benefit " while taking official actions on behalf of his benefactors -- allegations that @entity15 lied about his past to the @entity33 and to the @entity74 about his nomination to the federal bench " in order to conceal corrupt relationships , " @entity8 said in his floor statement as prepared for delivery @entity15 was invited to testify , but he declined to do so , @entity8 said			1
" his long - standing pattern of corrupt activity , so utterly lacking in honesty and integrity , demonstrates his unfitness to serve as a @entity131 , " he said			2
@entity15 , 63 , has not worked as a judge since he was suspended with pay in the fall of 2008 , @entity44 said			1
the last federal judge impeachment occurred last year , when judge @entity136 of the @entity137 resigned after being impeached on charges of sexual assault , obstructing and impeding an official proceeding , and making false and misleading statements , according to the web site of the @entity143			2
