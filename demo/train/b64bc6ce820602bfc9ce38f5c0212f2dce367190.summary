-- i own a property in @entity3 , @entity4 , called the @entity5			0
it is a beautiful place , where we have worked very hard to restore the landscape , reintroduce native wildlife species and raise bison sustainably			0
but it sits about 15 miles downstream of the point where @entity13 's proposed @entity12 would cross the @entity5 , and being that close has led me to examine more closely the potential risks and benefits of a project about which i have been highly skeptical from the beginning			2
after careful scrutiny , i believe it is not in our national interest to pursue it			0
the purpose of @entity12 is to bring tar sands crude oil through the @entity25 to @entity27 refineries			1
the route through the @entity25 is actually the oil industry 's second choice : transporting the oil west from @entity32 to the @entity33 would be shorter and much cheaper , but @entity34 concerned about environmental impacts and threats to native people 's lands are challenging that route , and with good reason			2
the existing and potential environmental impacts along the 2,000 - mile pipeline route are profound			0
in @entity34 , extraction of tar sands crude requires clear - cutting thousands of acres of boreal forests , diverting rivers , strip - mining , and destroying critical habitat for some of the largest populations of woodland caribou left in the world			1
thirty percent of @entity54 's songbirds and 40 % of its waterfowl rely on the wetlands and waterways of the boreal forest			0
@entity59 sands oil production has already created more than 50 square miles of toxic waste ponds so massive they are visible from space			1
even more important , tar sands oil extraction produces three times more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and gas , putting even greater strain on our atmosphere and oceans , which have little absorptive capacity left			1
closer to home , the pipeline presents an immediate threat to drinking water for millions and to the livelihood of farmers and ranchers			2
to transport via pipeline , the thick tar sands crude must be mixed with toxic chemicals and then pumped at extreme temperature and pressure			1
this sets the stage for more pipeline failures and spills that create a highly toxic mess			0
the existing @entity92 tar sands pipeline has spilled more than 12 times in its first 12 months of operation			1
in july 2010 , a spill of more than 800,000 gallons of toxic tar sands crude from the @entity99 pipeline contaminated more than 30 miles of water and shoreline along the @entity102 in @entity103			1
this created public health problems , threats to groundwater , widespread fish kills , and destruction of wildlife habitat , contamination that is still being cleaned up at a cost exceeding $ 700 million			0
downstream landowners like me are thinking this is a preview of coming attractions if @entity12 is built			0
the potential for pollution of vital groundwater from the @entity12 is even more frightening			0
depending on the final route of the pipeline , spills would threaten the @entity123 , the largest aquifer in the western @entity54 region , upon which millions of people and agricultural businesses depend for drinking water , irrigation and livestock watering			2
but spills anywhere along the route would threaten crucial drinking water supplies , from local and municipal drinking water wells to the @entity133 in @entity134 , a critical water supply for drought - stricken @entity134 and @entity136			2
anyone with even a passing familiarity with the water scarcity problems in that region should understand how a sizable pipeline failure could have catastrophic consequences			0
meanwhile , the pro-pipeline lobby is pushing the public to accept @entity12 with fuzzy promises about jobs and security			0
but @entity13 's jobs claims have been widely discredited , and there is no guarantee the oil transported by the pipeline would remain in the @entity25 for sale			2
an attempt in @entity154 to require the oil to be consumed in the @entity25 was rejected just last week , and it has been widely detailed that @entity27 refineries plan to export the finished product to @entity158 and @entity159			1
how do we become more energy secure under that scenario ? now @entity154 , by means of an amendment to the highway bill , is pushing to wrest decision - making control over the project from the administration , bypass final environmental review , and force approval of the pipeline before the final route has even been determined			1
@entity154 should not be in the business of skirting the rules and ramming through a polluting project like the @entity12			1
instead of supporting the transport of dirty tar sands oil , its focus should be on harnessing truly clean , renewable energy sources like solar , wind and biofuels , which will create thousands of long - lasting jobs in the @entity25 , protect our natural resources and provide true energy and water security today and for many years to come			1

@entity12 would bring tar sands crude oil across @entity25 to @entity27 refineries
@entity195 : @entity59 sands oil means clear - cutting thousands of acres , diverting rivers , strip - mining
pipeline puts drinking water at risk , poses profound danger of toxic spills and more , he says
@entity195 : @entity154 trying to skirt rules and force approval of polluting @entity92 project
