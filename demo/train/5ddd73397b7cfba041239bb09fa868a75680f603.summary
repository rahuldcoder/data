@entity0 , @entity1 -- the snipers , dug deep into their hidden positions in the snow , peer down at the valley below , searching for movement in the makeshift buildings set up			1
" the open doorway ... a guy standing in the open distance five to 30 meters , " one sniper comments as he stares through binoculars at the objective more than 1,000 feet below			1
there wo n't be a shot taken though			1
perched approximately 10,000 feet up on a mountain top in the @entity21 , the @entity19 snipers are receiving elite training , learning how to shoot and kill in freezing , rugged terrain			1
the experience and skills will be helpful in the unforgiving mountains of @entity27			1
the men are already qualified snipers , but in this advanced training at the @entity30 in @entity0 , @entity1 , they learn to shoot at steep angles in an extreme environment			1
senior snipers are always nearby to mentor			1
" how are you guys doing ? " gunnery sgt. @entity37 asks the group , crouching down at the top of their snow fort			1
" good , " the snipers reply			1
" how come no one 's got a stove going ? " @entity37 asks			2
" no one 's got any empty canteens ? there you go , you should be working , " he pushes the men			2
getting to the encampment is a slog through deep snow			2
it takes 4 1/2 hours of climbing to get to the seven snipers , trekking through snow as deep as 3 feet			1
the only sign of the snipers is bark - colored head caps			1
they moved in the night before , climbing six miles in the darkness , with only moonlight to guide their movement			2
it took the group less than three hours , much faster than a civilian pace , to complete the journey			2
upon reaching the summit , the group set up a security perimeter and spent four hours digging out a snow fortification			2
one sniper , who only wanted to be identified as @entity73 , explained , " off to my right we have our observation post where we have eyes on with a sniper and spotter down on the objective at the bottom of the valley			2
we have a trench set up here on my left			2
" @entity73 , who says he is living out his childhood dream of being a sniper , says operations in the frigid mountains are especially tough			1
" you move in under the cover of darkness ... the temperature last night dropped down a whole lot			2
probably into the high teens , " he said			2
" you try to keep it small			2
you try to stay tactical			0
you 've got the objective about 500 meters ( a third of a mile ) down the slope so you have to keep in mind the sound level you 're making and staying low and out of sight			0
" learning how to survive in the harsh mountainous terrain is an essential part of the training			0
" it gives them initially the ability to move over this type of terrain			0
it 's not as easy as one would think			0
it 's not sunday playing in the yard , " @entity37 said			0
" the mountains are a pretty formidable foe , " he said			1
" in addition to the enemy , the mountains themselves are a threat and it takes certain skills and training to move over them efficiently and be able to still perform those complicated tasks that the battalion commander assigns them with			1
" the snipers often supplement the gear they 're issued with supplies from sporting good stores that they feel may work better in the environment			1
one essential gadget the group had in the dug - out trench was a ministove			0
" you have to heat up the snow to make water			1
it lightens up your pack			0
you only have to carry about 2 quarts at one time ' cause you can just refill as you go , " @entity73 said			0
hydrating and warmth seem to be the basics for this group			1
" we bring what we want as far as comfort items go			0
so pack light , freeze at night , " one sniper , who wished not to be identified , said			0
for these @entity19 , the training is very real			0
many are preparing to deploy to @entity27 in the coming weeks and months			1
" the mountain sniper course focuses a lot on high angle shooting and that has a lot to do with the way the current war is shaping			0
we are moving out of urbanized areas and moving into more mountainous terrain , " @entity73 said			0
another sniper , who wished not to be identified , agreed with @entity73 on the importance of the skills learned			0
" it 's definitely an asset in the military , especially in an anti-terrorism role : you need more precision , you need to be like a scalpel in a way instead of just going around guns ablazing , " he said			0
precision is everything for this group , whose goal is one shot , one kill			0
@entity37 said these snipers must be able to shoot and kill from 1,000 yards away , or a distance of about 10 football fields			1
" the @entity30 snipers ' job is to basically engage targets at long range			1
essentially they are the guardian angel for the battalion			0
they survey the battlefield , find potential threats and with approval eliminate the threats , as well as provide reconnaissance and surveillance on objectives to give accurate information back to the battalion and let them know what 's out there , " he said			0
about 25 % of the @entity19 who take part in the mountain sniper training fail , but those enduring the course say they draw strength from their fellow snipers and the accomplishment that comes with completion			1
" it 's definitely miserable but you have to roll with the punches and you enjoy it once it 's done			0
once you get it under your belt there 's a lot of satisfaction in it , " @entity73 said			0
