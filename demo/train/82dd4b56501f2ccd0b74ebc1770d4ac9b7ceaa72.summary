-- the crew of the drill rig @entity5 may have been overworked and short of key personnel before the explosion that unleashed the worst oil spill in @entity10 history , a leading @entity2 congressman suggested tuesday			1
payroll records show that 20 crewmen -- including seven of the 11 who died on the rig -- had worked a 24 - hour shift six days before the explosion , rep. @entity11 wrote in a letter to @entity19 , ceo of rig owner @entity21 workers typically work 12 - hour days			2
and records showed only 18 people at work on the second shift on april 20 , the night of the explosion , " with zero engineers , electricians , mechanics or subsea supervisors listed in the report , " he added			0
" although these reports do not provide a complete picture of who exactly was working during the time of the explosion and in the days leading up to it , when combined with the ongoing @entity36 internal investigation that suggests that inattentiveness may have been a contributing factor in the disaster , i have serious questions about whether enough people were working on the night of april 20 to adequately handle the complex operations that were being performed , or if crew fatigue caused by extended shifts may have played a role , " wrote @entity11 , @entity33 , the chairman of the @entity34			2
@entity11 called on the company to give his committee more detailed logs and a further explanation of its staffing -- a request @entity59 said it would meet			1
but @entity59 said no worker put in a 24 - hour day , and the documents @entity11 cited did n't tell the whole picture			1
@entity64 drilling reports track operations and " certain personnel , " it said , " but does not use them to catalog complete crew shifts or the actual hours worked by each crewmember			0
" " at the time of the accident , the @entity5 and its crew had compiled seven consecutive years of operations without a single lost - time safety incident , " the company said in a written statement			0
" the vessel was properly and professionally manned ; there was no shortage of technical expertise , nor did any crewmember work a 24 - hour shift			2
" @entity0 was given access to individual time sheets that appear to back up @entity59 's claim that no employees worked 24 - hour shifts on april 14 -- six days before the explosion that eventually sank the rig			1
and other documents reviewed by @entity0 seem to indicate that additional salaried workers may have been on the job that do n't show up on time sheets , possibly refuting the committee 's claim the rig was shortstaffed on april 20			1
@entity59 , well owner @entity36 and oilfield services contractor @entity97 have blamed each other for the disaster that followed the explosion			1
the undersea well the rig was drilling has been gushing up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of crude a day into the @entity104 since late april			2
@entity11 's committee is one of several in both houses of @entity108 to hold hearings into the spill , which now dwarfs 1989 's @entity112 disaster			0
in addition , a presidential commission and a @entity116 - @entity115 board in @entity117 are investigating			0
@entity36 reported problems controlling the well and won a delay in testing a critical piece of equipment in march , according to documents released in late may			0
@entity125 , a laborer on the doomed rig , told the @entity127 that drilling had to stop four times in three weeks because of the loss of drilling fluid , " either because the underground formation was unstable or because drilling too quickly caused the formation to crack			0
" the well was five weeks behind schedule , and some of the survivors have told @entity0 that @entity36 cut corners and pushed ahead with the well despite safety concerns			0
in addition , @entity140 , the rig 's chief mechanic , told the @entity127 that @entity36 and @entity59 managers argued over drill plans the day of the explosion and that cuts to @entity5 's engineering staff left the crew with a backlog of preventive maintenance to perform .			1

new : @entity59 documents appear to refute *lawmaker* 's claims
owner says documents do n't tell whole story
says rig staffed " properly and professionally "
congressman *raises* " serious questions " about staffing
