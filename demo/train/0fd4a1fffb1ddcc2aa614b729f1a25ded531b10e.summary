as partisans argued pointedly over same - sex marriage outside the @entity4 @entity3 , justices inside hinted at their disparate views on the hot - button issue -- though it 's far from clear how they will rule			1
the stakes , though , are decidedly clearer			0
in the case argued tuesday and another to be heard on wednesday , the nine justices could fundamentally alter how @entity4 law treats marriage			2
on one extreme , the court could extend a constitutional right for gays and lesbians to wed in all 50 states			0
on the other , it could deal a major setback to the gay rights movement			0
and then there are options in between			0
" this was a deeply divided @entity3 , and a court that seemed almost to be groping for an answer here , " said @entity26 senior legal analyst @entity25			2
hear and read the arguments in full @entity25 was among those who followed 80 minutes of arguments tuesday over @entity34 's @entity33 , which bans same - sex marriage			1
voters approved the proposal 52 % to 48 % in november 2008 , less than six months after the state @entity3 ruled marriage is a fundamental right that must be extended to same - sex couples			1
the overriding legal question in the @entity34 case , @entity41 ( 12 - 144 ) , is whether the @entity46 's 14th @entity45 guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage as that state has			1
from their questioning , it appeared evident how a few justices were leaning			2
four of the more liberal justices seemed at least open to the idea that same - sex marriage should be allowed in @entity34			1
three of the more conservative justices seemed aligned with the view that it should only be for a man and a woman , and it 's likely they 'd be joined by justice @entity65 , who does n't speak at arguments			2
that could leave justice @entity68 as , has often been the case , the swing vote			0
he was among those who weighed in on whether the advocacy group appointed to defend the initiative has standing to argue the case			2
while admitting the law 's defenders are " not just any citizens , " @entity68 raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same - sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place			1
key questions answered justice @entity87 said it is the state 's responsibility -- through its elected leaders -- to defend laws in court , and that private individuals could not establish " how their injury was separate from everyone else			2
" @entity34 attorney general @entity97 , the state 's top lawyer , said tuesday she " declined to defend proposition 8 because it violates the @entity46			1
" if the court dismisses the appeal on the grounds its defenders do n't have the standing to defend the case in court , it may mean lower federal court rulings declaring the proposition unconstitutional would stand			1
but it would n't allow for a broader , final rule outlining the power of states to say who can or ca n't get married			2
announcement of rulings unlikely before june the justices did probe that broader legal question , including an exchange between pro-proposition 8 attorney @entity121 and justice @entity122			2
" the concern is that redefining marriage as a genderless institution will sever its abiding connection to its historic traditional procreative purposes , and it will ... refocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of marriage away from the raising of children and to the emotional needs and desires ... of adult couples , " @entity121 argued			2
to which @entity122 said : " mr. @entity121 , suppose a state said that , because ' we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation , we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55			0
' would that be constitutional ? " " no , your honor , it would not be constitutional , " @entity121 replied			0
tuesday 's hearing was the first of back - to - back sessions on same - sex marriage laws			1
the court will listen to arguments on wednesday on @entity4 v. @entity156 , a separate challenge to the federal @entity159 which , like the @entity34 law , defines marriage as between a man and a woman			1
that 1996 law prevents legally married same - sex couples from getting federal benefits and privileges , like tax breaks and survivor benefits , that are extended to opposite - sex couples			1
couple at the center of epic high court fight the court is unlikely to announce its decisions on both matters until june			0
@entity177 , general counsel for the @entity179 , the group defending proposition 8 , said its attorney had " credibly presented the winning case for marriage			1
" " we think the hearing went very well , " he told reporters			0
attorneys representing the two couples seeking to overturn @entity33 , meanwhile , said they could n't tell how the court would rule			0
" we are confident where the @entity4 people are going with this , " said @entity190			0
" we do n't know for sure what the @entity3 is going to do , but we 're very , very grateful they listened , they heard , they asked hard questions , and there 's no denying where the right is			1
" spirited rallies on both sides of debate one of the plaintiff couples -- @entity206 and @entity207 of @entity208 , @entity34 , who want to marry but ca n't because of @entity33 -- contend the state is discriminating against them because of their sexuality			2
" this is about our freedom and our liberty , " @entity206 said			0
" we are not trying to topple marriage			0
we are not trying to redefine marriage			0
what we are trying to say is that equality is the backbone of our country			0
" this view was echoed by fellow same - sex marriage supporters , who rallied outside the court with the hope that the justices would eventually issue a broad ruling to strike down bans nationwide			1
5 turning points in the debate " we are not asking for anything more than our neighbors , friends and family , but certainly expect no less , " said @entity231 , who spoke with his husband and their two children			0
but opponents who rallied nearby -- some of them carrying signs reading , " kids do best with a mom & dad " -- urged the court to keep out of the issue and leave the decision to states			0
" if you want to get married , go to one of the states that allows gay marriage , " said @entity249 , a conservative @entity251 talk - show host			2
" stop trying to force your agenda down our throats			0
quit trying to bully the @entity4 people with the homosexual agenda			0
" patchwork state laws the court could historically alter how the law treats marriage , striking down laws across the country banning same - sex marriage and matching an apparent cultural shift toward acceptance of same - sex couples			1
or it could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place , choosing to let state legislatures and state courts sort it all out			0
forty - one states now forbid same - sex marriage , although nine of them allow civil partnerships			1
nine other states allow same - sex marriage , and about 120,000 same - sex couples have gotten married , according to estimates			1
by the numbers : same - sex marriage @entity34 's ban seems to run counter to polls that show rising support overall for same - sex marriage			1
a @entity26 / @entity288 poll released on monday found 53 % of @entity4 now support same - sex marriage , up from 40 % in 2007			1
as to how the federal government should handle the issue -- the subject of wednesday 's hearing -- another @entity26 / @entity288 poll out tuesday found 56 % of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same - sex marriages			1
the @entity297 will argue against the @entity159 , a federal law , on wednesday			2
plaintiff : ' we were like most couples ' this comes as president @entity303 has changed positions on same - sex marriage over his political career			1
now fully supportive , he 's said would strike down @entity34 's law if he sat on the @entity3			1
other prominent politicians have voiced timely opinions in recent weeks , indicating the matter 's importance in 21st century @entity4 politics			0
@entity313 , the former secretary of state and possible 2016 @entity315 presidential candidate , publicly backed same - sex marriage earlier this month			1
the @entity317 has historically backed efforts to define marriage as only between a man and a woman			0
but there 's been notable movement of late among @entity317 , including sen. @entity325 's recent shift to support same - sex marriage , which he made two years after his son revealed to him that he is gay			1
" there is no putting this genie back in the bottle			0
the shift is here , and we 're not going back , " @entity317 strategist and @entity26 contributor @entity331 said sunday			0
