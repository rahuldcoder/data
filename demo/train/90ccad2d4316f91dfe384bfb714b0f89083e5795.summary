-- in the frigid cold of @entity3 , police discover a savage triple homicide , a family murdered , a killer still on the loose			1
there is a sole survivor , a young boy , gravely wounded , his family killed before his eyes			2
desperate to find the killer , detective inspector @entity11 turns to a retired hypnotist for help			1
he convinces dr. @entity16 to put the boy under hypnosis , hoping to discover the killer through his eyes			2
but entering the boy 's damaged consciousness unleashes a terrifying chain of events			1
hooked yet ? this is the premise of " @entity24 , " the latest " nordic noir " title wowing readers around the globe			1
one of the first things you should know about the chilling debut thriller from the author , @entity31 , is there is no @entity31			1
@entity31 is the pen name of @entity34 and @entity35 , a charming married couple from @entity3			1
both authors in their own right , their first collaboration has turned into an international sensation			0
" @entity24 " is a best - seller in @entity3 and across @entity42 , with a movie in the works			1
now the novel comes to the @entity46 , and @entity31 , or rather the @entity47 , have drawn the inevitable -- but in this case , well - deserved -- comparison to @entity3 's best - known crime writer , the late @entity50			1
@entity0 recently talked to the couple , and the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : what was the spark behind " @entity24 " ? the @entity47 : we happened to have several years of direct insight into professional hypnosis , so the idea of using a hypnotist as a key character came naturally to us			1
many crime novels are about getting as close as possible to victims and perpetrators			0
we thought it would be exciting to use a hypnotist , because he can actually step into other people 's memories			1
when we decided to write together , we challenged ourselves to transfer a filmic atmosphere into words			0
we want the readers to feel that they are there , inside the fiction , when they read @entity31 , almost believing they can influence the course of events			1
@entity0 : what do you think about all of the positive international attention ? @entity47 : we are of course very happy , but at the same time , we really need a kind of inner calm to be able to write , so we 're actually trying hard not to think about the success			0
" @entity24 " has sold to more than 36 countries and has been a best - seller wherever it 's been published			1
the director @entity86 is making it into a movie			2
it 's fantastic , but a good friend of ours , who understands the importance of relaxation when you write , gave us a number to a skillful hypnotist ! @entity0 : there was a big furor in @entity3 to find the real @entity31 , so why did you choose a pen name ? @entity47 : a pen name is often a way for an author to signal that he or she is writing with a new voice or in a new genre			1
we 've been writers in our own right for several years before we started to write together , and from the beginning we thought it was a great idea to stay secret behind a pen name			2
then two things happened unexpectedly : first , writing together was the most creative and enjoyable thing we 'd ever experienced ; and second , the media went crazy when the " @entity24 " was published in @entity3 in 2009			1
the whole nation was suddenly searching for the person behind @entity31			1
we tried to hide , but one dark night in august , two journalists with flashlights and cameras found us in our summer house			0
the next day , we packed our three daughters in our car and drove to @entity121 to meet the media and readers			0
@entity0 : how does your writing partnership work ? are there any special challenges because you are married ? @entity47 : if you told a couple who 's been together for almost 20 years , and live with their three young daughters in an apartment , that they were going to share a small study for several years and write novels together , they would probably just laugh , no matter how much they love each other			1
we 'd tried to write together several times previously , but each time , the cooperation has almost immediately turned into arguments and big fights			0
it was actually because of this we came up with the idea of creating a brand new writer			0
@entity31 is not @entity34 , nor @entity144			1
he has a life of his own			0
and the truth is , since we started to write as @entity31 , we have n't had a single fight			1
many authors who work together write alternate chapters , or divide the characters in the story between them			0
we do n't do that ; we write everything together , like two people playing the piano four - handed			2
we discuss the plot all the time -- when we pick up our children at school , when we shop for dinner			0
we even wake each other up in the middle of the night to discuss turning points			0
if we were to page through " @entity24 " or our sequel , we would n't be able to find a single sentence that only one of us wrote			1
it 's all the work of @entity31			1
@entity0 : what kind of research did you do on hypnosis ? @entity47 : @entity34 's big brother is a professional hypnotist and writes books about practical hypnosis			1
he was a perfect source			0
we read a lot of other works about hypnosis , and @entity34 was actually hypnotized himself			1
it was a surprise that hypnosis was truly enjoyable , even though you hand your own choice over to the hypnotist			2
and we were also surprised when we understood that the hypnotist himself goes into a kind of special trance during the sessions			2
almost everybody can be hypnotized , except if they do n't want to be ( such as @entity144 )			0
a person who is being hypnotized is in a state of deepest relaxation and seems to be nearly asleep			0
but if you look at the person 's brain activity , you see that the brain is totally awake , extremely active and alert			2
deep hypnosis is a very powerful elevator into the subconscious			0
@entity204 used it for a while but thought it revealed too much too fast			0
@entity0 : what do you think of the comparisons to @entity50 , and what are your thoughts about the continuing @entity214 crime fiction craze ? @entity47 : in fact , the name " @entity31 " in @entity31 is an homage to @entity50			1
we have a lot of ideals in common with him			0
on one hand , crime novels paint a very violent and dark world ; on the other hand , they make the failures of society clear and open for discussion , though the riddles should be solved and the perpetrators stopped when you close the book			2
we also share the love for complex characters with @entity50			1
because no matter how interesting the plot is that you create , the story will not be exciting if you do n't care about the characters			0
one thought we had about the @entity214 trend concerns the fear of darkness , because the source for all thrillers is that fear			0
but as a writer , you are almost certain that you can stop the perpetrators and guarantee happy endings			0
so writing is a way to disarm the fear for a moment , just like a roller coaster transforms the fear of heights into something fun during the ride			0
people have always been afraid of the dark , not only children			0
... and the fact is that it 's not that easy to find a darker place than @entity214 during the winter			2
the sun does n't even rise for three months in the northern parts			0
so with all this darkness , it 's maybe not that strange we have this strong tradition of crime writing			2
@entity0 : what 's next ? will you continue to work as a team ? @entity47 : our second @entity31 novel was published in @entity3 in july 2010 , and we 're deep into the third , which will come out november 11 in @entity3			1
we have the plot for the fourth book finished , plus a whole lot of exciting investigations , cold cases , mysteries and ideas that we think will be enough for at least eight books			2
every new book about detective inspector @entity11 is independent and will have different main characters , but @entity11 is the main character of the series			2
most writers are really lonely			0
you ca n't share your inner world with anybody for years while you 're writing a novel			0
but now , since @entity31 appeared , everything is different for us			1
we do n't long for the usual loneliness of a writer after this shared rush of creativity .			0
