the horrifying crash of @entity1 has put the @entity3 rebels operating in @entity5 's eastern regions center stage -- and raised all kinds of questions about who they are , what they want and who 's in charge			1
@entity13 and other officials have said it appears the plane was shot down by a sophisticated surface - to - air missile located within rebel - held territory			2
the rebels have repeatedly denied responsibility and instead point the finger at @entity5 's armed forces			1
where are the rebels ? the rebels are @entity3 militants concentrated in the eastern regions of @entity27 and @entity28 , with the industrial city of @entity27 a particular stronghold			1
recent gains by @entity5 armed forces have seen the territory controlled by the rebels contract			0
but the rural area where @entity36 crashed to earth july 17 remains under the rebels ' sway			1
the various rebel groups operating across the region do not appear to have a strong central command			0
when did they first appear on the scene ? after popular protests toppled @entity5 's @entity48 president @entity47 from power in february , @entity3 rebels first appeared in @entity5 's @entity50 , where they seized key infrastructure			1
the region was subsequently annexed by @entity53			1
unrest then broke out in eastern @entity5 , a heartland of support for @entity47 , where many people speak @entity53 and feel closer ties to @entity58 than to @entity59			1
rebel leaders in @entity28 and @entity27 seized key government buildings and declared themselves the heads of the @entity64 's republics of @entity27 and @entity28			1
in may , a referendum was held in each region on secession from @entity5			0
who are the main rebel leaders ? @entity70 , a @entity53 citizen , was appointed prime minister of the self - declared @entity72 and has been a prominent public face for the rebels			1
he 's the rebel leader who after speaking with @entity76 prime minister @entity75 agreed that the plane 's flight data recorders would be handed over			0
according to @entity80 , a @entity53 expert at the @entity82 - based @entity81 , there are rumors @entity84 is a @entity53 intelligence officer who has reached the rank of general in the @entity88 , the successor to the @entity90			1
" @entity70 himself has denied ( the rumors ) , but i would say that given his trips back and forth to @entity58 , he has certainly been consulting with parts of @entity53 intelligence over the past couple of months , " he said			1
in an interview with @entity101 's @entity100 , @entity70 denied any responsibility for the downing of @entity104			1
another name that crops up frequently is that of @entity107 , also known as @entity107 , the self - proclaimed defense minister for the people 's republic			0
according to @entity13 secretary of state @entity118 , @entity107 on july 17 " posted a social media report bragging about the shoot - down of a transport plane -- at which point when it became clear it was civilian , they pulled down that particular report			1
" also a @entity53 , @entity107 was a military commander in the rebel redoubt of @entity120 before it was retaken by @entity5 forces , later reappearing in @entity123			1
he was also present in @entity50 at the time of its annexation			0
added to an @entity128 sanctions list in april , he was described as being on the staff of the @entity53 military 's main @entity130			2
what is the rebels ' response to the claim they shot down @entity36 ? after three months or more of bitter fighting against the @entity5 authorities , the rebels are disinclined to believe anything they hear from @entity59 or the @entity140 , says freelance journalist @entity141 in @entity5			0
they deny shooting down @entity36 and many instead claim it is a provocation conjured up by the @entity5 authorities in @entity59 , he said			0
many of them claim they do n't have the equipment to have hit the plane			0
" anything that 's released by the current authorities in @entity59 is seen in rebel eyes as fabricated , as intended to -- essentially to draw @entity153 into @entity5 , " @entity141 said			0
asked about the growing weight of evidence gathered by @entity82 and @entity59 , such as social media postings and phone intercepts , @entity70 told @entity101 it was fake			2
" it is very simple to disprove it			0
all of the information that comes through the @entity163 , in my opinion , is practically all lies , " he said			0
would the rebels have been able to shoot down the plane ? @entity53 denies claims by @entity59 and the @entity140 that it has provided training , heavy weaponry and logistical support to the rebels			1
it also dismisses any direct involvement of @entity53 forces in @entity5			1
in recent weeks , rebel forces have brought down a number of @entity5 military aircraft in the eastern regions , including two @entity179 transport planes , several @entity181 and @entity182 helicopters , an @entity184 fighter jet and an @entity186 cargo plane			1
however , @entity5 and @entity13 officials believe @entity53 expertise would have been needed to operate the @entity190 , or @entity190 , antiaircraft system that seems increasingly likely to have been used to shoot down @entity36			2
@entity191 , @entity5 's director of informational security , told @entity101 that he is certain a @entity53 officer personally pushed the button to shoot down the plane			1
@entity101 's @entity195 , who has reported extensively from @entity5 and met many of the rebel fighters , said it was hard to say if any of them had the specialist training needed to operate the @entity190 system			0
" the people we 've met , the militia , they 're ragtag , a lot of them have old military experience , and that 's mostly ground , street - to - street fighting , rather than the technological stuff you need to know to run something like that			0
" a lot of heavy weaponry has flooded in during the past few weeks , said @entity195			0
" but the majority of video you see of separatist armor and weapons , lighter artillery , even @entity225 rocket launchers sometimes , are nothing of the scale of the @entity190			0
" what weapons do the rebels have ? the military aircraft brought down by the rebels were flying at relatively low altitudes and were for the most part brought down by shoulder - launched @entity235 missiles and @entity236 23 - 2 anti-aircraft guns			2
such weapons were seized when @entity240 rebels took control of several @entity5 military depots and bases			0
but those weapons are a world away from the @entity190 system , effective at a higher altitude , at which the @entity248 plane was flying			0
@entity249 , an expert on former @entity251 military hardware at @entity252 's , says that " the @entity190 is in both the @entity53 and @entity5 inventories , but it 's unclear whether the one suspected in the shoot - down was taken by rebels when they overran a @entity5 base , or was supplied by @entity53			1
" video posted by @entity5 's @entity260 on its @entity262 page shows a @entity190 system , according to the @entity5 officials , heading toward @entity53 , with one missile missing			2
@entity70 told @entity101 that the rebels had never been in control of a single @entity190 missile system			1
what does @entity53 say ? @entity53 insists it has no direct influence over the separatists			2
@entity53 president @entity272 has also been consistent in his denials of any @entity53 involvement in the bringing down of @entity104			1
" no one should have the right to use this tragedy to achieve selfish political objectives , " he said			0
foreign minister @entity279 said @entity53 wanted to see an objective , open and independent investigation , adding that @entity5 must take the initiative since the tragedy occurred on its territory			2
" with regard to the claims raised by @entity59 , that it was almost us who did it : in fact i have n't heard any truthful statements from @entity59 over the past few months , " he told state tv channel @entity53 24			2
@entity53 state media reports have sought to suggest that @entity5 's own armed forces may have been involved in bringing down @entity36			1
@entity297 , @entity53 's ambassador to the @entity298 , also blamed @entity5 for the crash in remarks monday			2
but when asked about audio recordings of purported @entity3 separatists talking about shooting down a plane , he suggested that if they did , it was an accident			2
" according to them , the people from the east were saying that they shot down a military jet , " he said			0
" if they think they shot down a military jet , it was confusion			0
if it was confusion , it was not an act of terrorism			0

the @entity3 rebels are concentrated in the eastern regions of @entity27 and @entity28
the leader of the self - declared @entity72 is @entity70
*analysts* say he is rumored to be a senior @entity53 intelligence officer
the rebels have denied any involvement in bringing down @entity1 17
