-- ten cases of polio have been confirmed among children in @entity6 , the first outbreak of the disease in that country since 1999 , a @entity2 spokesman told @entity0 tuesday			1
@entity2 's @entity10 said the confirmations were among 22 suspected cases that were identified on october 17 in the eastern city of @entity14 after the children exhibited symptoms of " acute flaccid paralysis " -- a sudden onset of weakness and floppiness in any part of a child 's body or paralysis in anyone in whom polio is suspected as the cause			1
the confirmation was key because other diseases can cause similar symptoms			1
most of the victims were younger than two years old and were unimmunized or underimmunized , @entity2 said in a statement			1
the @entity35 is working with international organizations and the @entity37 to get vaccine to all areas of @entity6 , health minister dr. @entity34 told @entity2 's regional committee on monday in @entity41 , @entity42 , the state - run @entity43 reported tuesday			1
but dr. @entity45 , the @entity2 's assistant director - general for polio , emergencies and country collaboration , told @entity0 last week that his organization was not waiting for the confirmation to mount a vaccination campaign			1
" as far as everyone is concerned , they 're treating this like polio , " he said			2
on october 24 , health officials launched a program to immunize 1.6 million @entity6 children against polio , measles , mumps and rubella -- in government - and rebel - held areas			1
the response , which will also include neighboring countries , is expected to last at least six months , the @entity2 said			1
according to @entity69 , 500,000 children in @entity6 have not been vaccinated against polio			1
given the fighting , the large - scale movement of refugees and the number of children who have not been fully immunized , " the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1 across the region is considered to be high , " it added			2
the highly infectious viral disease primarily affects young children			2
initial symptoms can include fever , fatigue , headache , vomiting , neck stiffness , limb pain and , in a small number of cases , paralysis and death			2
it can be prevented through immunization , but there is no cure			0
the incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99 % since 1988			0
it remains endemic in three countries -- @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 -- down from more than 125 countries in 1988			0
public health can be among the first casualties of war , as resources are diverted away from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines			1
despite the challenges posed by the ongoing civil war , the polio vaccination effort will be helped by the fact that @entity6 had high rates of vaccination coverage among its populace prior to the current conflict , @entity45 predicted			1
in an address friday to the @entity123 , the under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief cited the outbreak as an example of the privations endured by the @entity6 and the risks they face			1
diseases , including those easily preventable by basic hygiene and vaccination , are spreading " at an alarming rate , " said @entity133			2
in addition , reports of malnutrition have soared , and people suffering from chronic illnesses , such as cancer and diabetes , are dying for lack of access to treatment , she said			0
aid workers can not reach some 2.5 million people in the country , she added			0
" all humanitarian staff missions and convoys continue to require written approval , " she said , citing as " unacceptable " and " unpredictable " the government 's processing of visas for @entity123 and non-governmental staff members			0
more than 100 such visas are pending , many are limited to a single entry and many of those that are issued are for insufficient durations , she said			0
" there is simply no reason why humanitarian staff , whose only interest is to help those in desperate need , have not been granted visas to scale up our operations , " she said			0
in response , @entity6 's permanent representative to the @entity170 acknowledged to reporters in @entity173 that the country is facing grave humanitarian problems , but accused @entity176 of having failed to properly apportion blame			1
" she should know and say what are the root causes , " @entity178 told reporters , citing neighborhoods that are " under siege by the @entity181 because there are armed groups in these neighborhoods taking civilians as human shields			0
" @entity178 said his country is " a victim of interference by some member states into its domestic affairs			0
" regarding the issuance of visas , he said , " we are issuing too many visas to too many people ; we are a sovereign nation , like any other nation ; we have our own reasons sometimes to deny a visa to this or that individual			0
" @entity178 said @entity204 has extended visas to hundreds of people working for the @entity207 ( @entity207 ) , which is led by @entity176			0
" any minimal cases here and there " of problems " would n't affect the overall picture of our cooperation with @entity207 , " he said			2
according to the @entity170 , more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict , which began in march 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters			0
@entity0 's @entity217 contributed to this report			0
