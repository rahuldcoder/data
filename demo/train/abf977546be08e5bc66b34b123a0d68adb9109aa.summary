-- " @entity1 , " says @entity3 frontman @entity2			1
" it 's largely a pejorative sort of term			1
" that may sound odd coming from the hirsute leader of a 12 - piece collective that has a history of traveling in a renovated school bus			0
but while @entity2 and accordionist - vocalist @entity13 seem slightly perturbed by the choice of words , @entity2 's response indicates he does n't feel too slighted			1
" when one says ' hippie , ' and then they reference things like ' communal ' and all of those sort of bands from a very hopeful era , actually , where everything felt like it was on the precipice of something sort of infinite , and possible , i think that , in that sense , the word ' hippie ' would apply			0
these are hopeful days where anything is possible for the band			1
the @entity3 ' second album " here , " hit @entity33 on the @entity35 chart , and peaked atop @entity35 's @entity37 and folk album charts			1
besides one gig in august , the band is taking a break from touring until september 6			2
but people who want to see what it 's like on the road with the zeros can check out the new dvd " @entity47 , " which documents their april 2011 tour from @entity49 , @entity50 , to @entity51 by vintage train , along with @entity53 and @entity54			2
@entity2 says that from the band 's beginning , he told its manager he 'd like to perform at unconventional venues			1
" where i was at , at the time , was just a feeling of having really done the sort of cookie cutter sort of thing , and wanting to just completely abandon that for parking lots and parks and communal areas , and make the experience sort of loose , and sort of a free - for - all of joy , " @entity2 says			0
" i think when you do things that are just slightly out of the norm , it not only affects your experience of what just happened -- of the event -- but affects the way you view the possibilities of your own actions going forward in your life			0
" " like , to me , the railroad tour that we did with @entity84 and with @entity54 was a culmination of all of the sort of childhood sort of ideals of being with a crew -- with a band of sort of brothers and sisters , and all playing music together , on a train going who knows where			1
" that freewheeling feeling permeates the band 's music , and its mythology			1
@entity2 and @entity102 expressed that while telling stories about how the band formed			2
" i met @entity2 and @entity106 at @entity107 , which is a really exciting festival up in the desert , " @entity102 says , with @entity2 adding , " it sounds scripted			0
it sounds so exactly what people would expect " " i know			0
i know , " @entity102 says			0
" which is kind of ridiculous at this point			0
but , i was good friends with @entity106 's cousin and kind of introduced through friends and i do n't know , then music ensued			1
and that was like five years ago , i guess			0
" " literally , it sounds like an indie movie , " @entity2 adds			0
according to the pair , the band 's name evolved in a somewhat random way			1
while some writers have described " @entity3 " as @entity2 's alter ego , the singer says that 's a false belief			1
" it was just a story i was writing where the character was @entity3 , " he says			1
" and around the same time , i came up with a form of mathematics that has no known application , called @entity3			1
and then i started a @entity136 page called @entity3			1
" " it sort of got lost in translation			0
there 's sort of no character that i 'm playing or an alter ego really , but more something that i think that i 'm reaching towards within myself maybe , or that we all are			2
" with a dozen band members , it could be difficult find a role for everyone			2
but @entity102 says that diversity strengthens the band			2
" some people are trained jazz musicians , and some people went to -- trained in @entity156 , you know , for drumming and rhythm , and some of us kind of taught ourselves what we know , or picked up pieces here along the way , " she says			0
" so , i think when we all come together , it offers not just one school of thought , or one approach to playing or learning music , but everyone kind of throws in a different color into the pot. " @entity2 , who says he 's spiritual , while " not so fond of " religious order and dogma , says ultimately , the music creates itself			1
" the song tends to tell you exactly what it wants			0
you know what i mean ? and you just kind of have to listen to that , " he says			0
" so , if it wants a single voice in a section , it seems to be pretty obvious			0
if it wants a bunch of voices , then it seems to be pretty obvious			0
it 's a fun , sort of delicate process of listening for what the song wants			2

the @entity3 ' second album " here , " hit @entity33 on the @entity35 chart
the band 's name does not mean what some fans believe
the frontman says the music creates itself
