three years ago , director @entity0 made a movie about a mortician named @entity3 who went to prison after he shot a rich , cranky widow four times in the back with her armadillo gun and hid her body in a deep freezer under the pot pies			1
now he 's @entity3 's landlord			1
@entity3 , who was convicted of the 1996 murder of a wealthy @entity14 widow named @entity15 , was released from prison on tuesday			1
originally sentenced to life , he has been set free on a $ 10,000 bond -- with conditions			0
one of them is that he live in a garage apartment owned by @entity0 , the @entity23 , @entity14 - based director of such films as " before @entity26 , " " @entity25 , " " @entity27 " and 2011 's " @entity3 , " based on @entity3 's case			1
@entity0 offered up the place			1
it 's another strange twist in a case that 's been full of them			1
for years , @entity3 was a cheerful , well - regarded funeral director in the town of @entity36 , @entity14			1
as recounted in @entity40 's @entity39 story " midnight in the @entity41 , " the townspeople were four - square behind @entity3 , despite the fact that he 'd admitted to @entity45 's murder -- and stored her body in a freezer for several months			1
" i had been so flummoxed by the twists and turns of this case for the last 17 years , " @entity40 told @entity50 's @entity49			1
" i just could n't imagine what was going to happen next , and here it comes			0
a turn of events that if you put a bunch of @entity60 screenwriters into the same room and told them to put out a new @entity3 story , they never could have come up with this			1
" @entity40 described @entity3 as " the nicest guy in town			2
he ran the campaign for the @entity70 fundraiser			0
he raised money for the new wing of the sunday school building			0
he bought the trophy shop when it went out of business so the kids could keep getting the trophies			0
he was a kind of @entity79			0
he was this man who cared about people			0
and most of all he cared about them at their deaths , giving them this dignified funeral , and leading them into the next life			0
people loved what he did for them			0
" wherever you go in @entity36 , there are people who look up to @entity3 as if he is a saint			2
and that he just made one little mistake with mrs. @entity15			0
just one , " @entity40 said			0
" there are lots of @entity98 men in @entity36 , these people say , who make two , three , four or more mistakes			0
and we forgive them , why ca n't we forgive @entity3 for just making one mistake of shooting a lady in the back four times ? " @entity45 was n't as beloved			2
" if she had held her nose any higher , " one man was quoted in @entity109 's article , " she would have drowned in a rainstorm			2
" another resident told prosecutor @entity115 , " she was so mean that even if @entity3 did kill her , you wo n't be able to find anyone in town who 's going to convict him for murder			1
" @entity3 had befriended @entity45 after her husband 's death			1
he eventually became a close confidant -- they even traveled together -- and sole heir to her $ 10 million fortune			0
however , according to the article , the demanding @entity45 also treated @entity3 poorly			2
sometime in late 1996 , he shot her to death			2
@entity3 was convicted of @entity45 's murder in 1999			1
@entity0 was fascinated by the case			1
" i knew @entity3 and this town			2
i just knew this world so well , " he told the @entity132 in 2012			0
in @entity0 's film , @entity3 was played by @entity136 and @entity45 by @entity137			1
@entity138 , then beginning the career upswing that eventually led to his @entity140 earlier this year for " @entity141 , " played @entity115			0
it was " @entity3 " that helped get @entity3 out of prison			2
according to the @entity146 , attorney @entity145 saw the film at a @entity39 screening and was troubled by some of the issues it raised			0
taking @entity3 as a client , she learned he had been sexually abused			2
armed with that evidence , as well as a belief the sentence was unduly harsh , she got @entity3 's sentence reduced to time served			1
@entity157 said the parties involved are not allowed to comment on tuesday 's court proceeding			0
she added that it was part of the bond 's conditions			0
@entity45 's family is n't happy with @entity3 's release			1
" @entity3 committed a cold - blooded , calculated murder , killing our mother and grandmother , @entity15 , in her home , " @entity165 , a @entity45 family spokesman , said in a statement			1
" he confessed to her murder and his confession was admitted in his trial			0
a jury found him guilty and sentenced him to life in prison , where he should remain			0
" @entity45 's granddaughter said the drama surrounding @entity3 has taken attention away from his victim			1
" it seems like we 've forgotten about my grandmother in all of this storytelling , and it does n't feel like we 're getting justice for the murder victim in this case , " @entity183 said			1
and the movie has n't helped , she said			0
" a lot of people 's opinions about this are all based on the movie , which is a fiction , " the granddaughter said			2
" this is n't a fiction for my family			0
this is real life for my family			0
" @entity36 residents , however , generally approve of @entity3 's release			1
@entity204 , who knew @entity3 , told @entity205 , @entity14 , tv station @entity207 , " i 'm glad that he 's out			1
" " i do n't think that he 's a threat to anybody anywhere , " he added , " but in the back of my mind you do say well , he did murder her and put her in a freezer			2

in 1996 , @entity3 killed rich @entity14 widow and hid her in a freezer
the *bizarre* case became subject of film " @entity3 "
@entity225 's director , @entity0 , is letting @entity3 use an apartment he owns
victim 's granddaughter : " it seems like we 've forgotten about my grandmother "
