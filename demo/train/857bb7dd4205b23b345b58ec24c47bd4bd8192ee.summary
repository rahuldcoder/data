-- save for some bit roles in a smattering of unremarkable tv shows , the world has n't heard much from @entity6 since 2000			1
that 's when his reign as @entity9 , the lovable goofball lead on the seminal @entity12 sitcom " @entity13 , " came to an end			1
but last week , with one tweet , @entity6 returned to our lives : " i 'm going to be a father ! " the 32 - year - old wrote			1
" well , on tv at least			2
the ' @entity13 ' sequel is officially happening ! " yes , much to the delight of twentysomething @entity24 aficionados everywhere , " @entity13 " is getting a reboot			1
titled " @entity31 , " the spinoff series , which is set to begin shooting in february and will air on the @entity33 , stars both @entity6 and @entity35 ( as his wife , @entity26 ) and follows the couple 's experience raising a 13 - year - old daughter			1
@entity0 needed more answers , so we rang up @entity6 to find which , if any , old cast members would be returning , and how he 's preparing for impending fatherhood			1
@entity0 : congratulations are in order			2
what has life been like since the @entity31 announcement ? @entity6 : it 's been pretty			1
i 'm gon na say pretty exciting			2
let 's leave it at that			2
@entity0 : are you surprised at how insanely happy people are about this ? @entity6 : well , it was very nice			1
i 'll say it was exciting and flattering that people are still so excited about the show after all this time			2
@entity58 @entity0 : the show 's popularity is tied into people 's @entity12 - related nostalgia			2
how aware were you of the show 's revered status among people of a certain age ? @entity6 : i mean , i knew it was a highly - regarded show , and i know it holds a special place in people 's hearts after all this time			1
like i said , it 's very flattering			2
but , you know , the other thing is , it was a big part of my childhood as well			2
as important as it is to a lot of fans and a lot of people who watched our show , it 's just as important to me after all this time			1
it was an integral part of my life too , obviously			1
@entity0 : apparently it was a big part of @entity88 's and @entity89 's , as well			2
@entity6 : it 's a little ridiculous			1
it 's very nice , though			2
all of it is very flattering			2
i know a lot of people grew up with that show			1
the funny thing is , back then -- and it sounds like i 'm talking about some prehistoric age -- it was not long ago we did n't have as much options of cable television and @entity102			1
and we were all kind of in the same place at one point just watching @entity24 on friday nights			2
and so , to a lot of people , this show means a lot			1
@entity0 : thanks to your role as @entity9 and your brother @entity115 as @entity116 on " @entity116 , " many people feel they know the @entity6 family on an intimate level			1
@entity6 : at the risk of using this word too often , it 's flattering			1
and it 's very nice that people think of us that way			2
it 's nice that we have a special bond with the public			2
@entity0 : much of the show 's success and continued popularity over the years is due to its ability to speak to both kids and adults			2
@entity6 : i guess it was kind of a hybrid of a kids ' show and an adult show			1
we were just having fun on that show			2
everyone was just kind of having a blast			2
the writers were a lot of fun			1
and the directors were always fun			0
and the acting was always fun			0
it was just a fun experience			0
so hopefully that came across to our viewers			0
at the same time , we tried to communicate some sort of message that was somewhat wholesome and had some sort of meaning			0
and i think people appreciate it			0
i think people can really appreciate a show with a good message , but one that does that with some humor			0
@entity12 fashion gets a second spin @entity0 : had the idea for a @entity13 sequel come up over the years ? @entity6 : in an official capacity , no. this was really the first time where it had sort of been mentioned in an official way			1
i mean , people have been discussing it for a long time -- some sort of movie - of - the - week or some sort of , i guess , some sort of film about the show			0
but i think that everyone associated with the show wanted to make sure that if we were to come back , that we were n't going to do it in a way that was going to be a disservice to the show			1
no one wanted to really cash in , if you will , too early , or no one really wanted to do something that was going to be cheesy			0
so when we all decided to get together for this , there were a lot of discussions			1
i mean , this has been going on for months in an unofficial way			0
but the build - up to this @entity205 , there was a lot of discussions and a lot of conversations to make sure we were all on the same page about what we were doing			1
@entity0 : were you hesitant to sign on ? @entity6 : let me say this : it was n't that i was resistant			1
i think it was just a matter of making sure all of us were on the same page about what we were going to do in terms of making the show last another seven years , hopefully			0
there were different options around of following our characters or following this			0
but it just seems a little poetic that we 're coming back 13 years later and it 's following our daughter 's character			0
i like that concept , because it 's very poetic and it 's kind of passing it off to the next generation			0
@entity0 : the sequel would n't have worked without both you and @entity35 returning			1
@entity6 : it was interesting how it came together			1
but @entity35 and i had definitely had a lot of discussions of what we wanted to do , and if we were both onboard			1
again , just making sure that everything was right and we felt right about it			0
listen , the people that are doing the show -- @entity246 is the executive producer -- they know what we 're about , and they know what we 're looking for			0
i guess it 's also a matter of trust that we 're all on the same page			0
' ' @entity13 ' : where are they now ? @entity0 : a lot of people are wondering if other original cast members , such as @entity262 's @entity261 or @entity264 ' mr. @entity263 , will be back in the mix. @entity6 : we 're going to wait and see what happens			1
obviously , i do n't want to give away too many details			1
but there 's definitely been discussions about some of everyone 's favorite characters popping up in the show and making appearances			0
we 'll see what happens			0
@entity0 : we 'd like to see a return of @entity280 ' @entity279			0
@entity6 : [ laughs ] that 's definitely an interesting way to go			1
i 'm not sure when he stopped being on the show			0
i 'm not sure , but i 'm definitely in favor of a return of @entity279			0
why not ? @entity0 : when do you start shooting ? @entity6 : we start shooting , i think , february of next year			1
@entity0 : some people are worried the show will be a bust			0
@entity6 : we want to do justice to the characters , and we want to make sure we respect people 's memories of the show			1
it 's funny , a lot of the tweets and emails and mentions i 've gotten are from a lot of people who are worried that the show wont ' hold up			2
and that we should n't do it because it 's going to ruin a lot of their childhood memories			1
and i totally can understand that -- i get it			0
i know there are things that they 've done in the past where i feel like it 's ruined my childhood memories			0
and i did n't like that			2
but we 're really working hard and doing everything we can to make sure that this is going to be something special and funny , and hopefully it 'll make new memories for a new generation			0
@entity0 : how does it feel knowing you 're about to be a father -- onscreen , that is ? @entity6 : well , i dunno [ laughs ]			1
in real life i 've just been an uncle up to this point			1
which has been great -- it 's a nice role			0
we 'll see how fatherhood works for me			0
@entity0 looks back on nineties with new anthology @entity0 : maybe you can draw from your experiences as an uncle for the role			0
i think it 's slightly different			0
being an uncle is easy			0
you just get to stick around for the fun pasts			0
@entity0 : no babies waking you up in the middle of the night			0
@entity0 : have you started the casting process for the role of yours and @entity35 's daughter ? @entity6 : we 're working on that right now			1
there have been a few names tossed around			0
we 're meeting with girls and auditioning and that whole process			0
you know , we 're slowly trying to find the perfect girl			0
@entity0 : lastly , how often do random strangers call you @entity9 ? @entity6 : it 's a bit of a humblebrag if i make that complaint			1
i 'll just say , again , going back to our favorite word , it 's always very flattering when people recognize me			0
see original story at @entity0 .			0

@entity6 will play the father in the " @entity13 " reboot
he said he and *co-star* @entity35 had a lot of talk about what to do
in real life he does n't have any children of his own
