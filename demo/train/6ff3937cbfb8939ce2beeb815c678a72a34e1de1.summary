-- wednesday night 's debate showcased a @entity2 resisting his worst debating weaknesses and playing solidly to his strengths			1
@entity5 ? this time , he could n't overcome a weakness he has shown before , a tendency to distance himself from the audience , and this kept him from connecting and making a good showing			1
but both have a track record of debates showcasing their strengths and weaknesses , and they are both good debaters			1
this is only the first of three performances			0
many of their old habits emerged again , both good and bad			0
they will need to study their take - home lessons			0
let 's begin with @entity2			1
three of of @entity2 's debating strengths are being smooth and knowledgeable and having excellent first - line answers to questions			1
wednesday night ? opinion : @entity2 was hungry , @entity5 was flat check			1
listen , @entity2 can handle these debates			1
he was strong in all areas wednesday night			0
and y'all should n't be surprised that he performed so well			0
for him to falter , the moderator is going to have to do a much better job than @entity34			0
@entity2 talked over him so often that i swear one time i saw @entity34 slumping behind his desk while he meekly gazed up at @entity2 and muttered , " excuse me , i believe you have my stapler			1
" @entity2 has potential weaknesses : this smoothness has sometimes gotten in his way , which is how he got the " @entity46 " moniker			1
but he corrected the potential error and instead had a solid , conversational manner in the debate			0
@entity2 's other potential weakness is where he shined the most			1
in the @entity53 primaries , @entity2 was n't a great debater when he was trailing in the polls			1
he debated to win instead of " not to lose " ( which is what @entity5 did )			1
@entity2 put @entity5 on the defensive and kept him there all night defending his policies			1
@entity2 stuck to his theme of too much government overstretch during the @entity5 administration , whether on energy subsidies , health care , taxes or increasing the deficit			1
he kept the debate on the economy and jobs while flatly stating that it was overreach of federal government power that was what has inhibited our economy from recovering			0
and he made the point well			0
opinion : @entity2 shakes up the race as for @entity5 , one strength is that he is solid at picking a theme and sticking with it			1
wednesday night was no different			0
but what a difference four years makes			0
against @entity84 in 2008 , @entity5 focused on the economy as his theme and hammered away at @entity87 and @entity84			1
this time , @entity5 clearly presented his theme			2
the problem was that the new premise lacked bite			0
what was it ? that @entity2 has no specific plan			2
@entity5 mentioned this time and time again : taxes , deficit reduction , entitlements , regulations to @entity98 and health care			2
@entity2 has not specified the details of how he will govern in all these important areas			2
the problem was that @entity5 needed to couple that theme with something else			2
just stating it over and over is hardly a scathing indictment			0
and it failed to put @entity2 on the defensive			2
reasoning is another strength @entity5 has shown in previous debates , but he was unable to use it in any significant way			2
near the beginning of the debate , he mentioned that arithmetic proved @entity2 's plans unworkable			1
while i thought this was an excellent point , it should have been much more forceful			0
which brings us to @entity5 's weaknesses : i wrote two days ago that his detachment was one weakness , that he can appear dispassionate and distancing to the audience			1
unfortunately for the president , he did n't correct this			0
in fact , it was worse			0
indeed , this was probably his poorest showing at trying to connect with the @entity133 people			0
being emotionless can work either for or against you			0
for @entity5 , with a troubled economy , it works against the president			2
if our economy is n't fully recovered and we 're in hard times , our president should at least show more empathy			0
offer strong examples to show that he understands			0
couple that with @entity5 's failure to tie @entity2 to anything related to the famous 47 % comment , and i 'd call it a glaring error in the debate			1
opinion : it was n't just @entity2 who won you know it 's bad when at the end of the debate , uber - wealthy @entity2 seems like he cares more about the middle class and even the lower class than the sitting @entity160 president of the @entity133			1
both candidates get almost two weeks off before their next debate			0
here 's what they each need to do in the meantime in their preparation			0
@entity5 needs to find a much more effective way to pin @entity2 down to a specific policy			1
although he is correct that some of @entity2 's numbers simply do n't add up , @entity5 must do a better job of wrestling the details out of him			1
he simply has to put @entity2 on the defensive more often and provide arguments ( and passion ) that will resonate with voters			1
he ca n't let opportunities slip by to tie @entity2 to the 47 % comment or even to the old policies of @entity87			2
this will be no easy task , since @entity2 was able to fend off most criticisms with ease in his many @entity53 primary debates			2
@entity5 will need to stick to one subject over a series of exchanges			2
if he does n't , @entity2 will be like @entity188 , and nothing @entity5 says will stick to him in these debates			1
and the president should utilize the backward - step - pivot - forward technique as often as possible			0
since @entity2 will continue to put him on the defensive ( and this is guaranteed ) , @entity5 must turn potential flaws into strengths			1
it 's easy enough to predict @entity2 's attacks			1
now , the president must figure out rhetorically how to turn those criticisms into benefits			0
opinion : @entity2 was n't stellar , but @entity5 fell short and for goodness sake , @entity5 , show more energy and passion			1
for @entity2 : steady as she goes			2
he needs to keep debating precisely like wednesday night			0
it was n't a fluke , and he can prove it			0
@entity2 was assertive ( compared with @entity5 's passivity )			1
but there 's a fine line between assertiveness and aggression			2
@entity2 was assertive in this debate without being aggressive			1
if he decides that his bullying technique of the moderator was effective ( it worked wednesday night , but i would n't push my luck if i were him ) , then he risks alienating voters			0
the same is true with his demeanor toward the president			0
@entity2 can lose more votes than he can gain in future debates if he comes across as rude or mean , an impression many had of @entity84 four years ago			2
he must stay on the offense			0
but do n't overdo it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			2

@entity231 : @entity2 played to his strengths , @entity5 to his weaknesses in debate
he says @entity2 aced keeping " smooth " from turning " slick "
@entity5 's lack of passion kept him from connecting with voters ; he missed chances to hit back
@entity231 : @entity5 needs to heat up , pin @entity2 down ; @entity2 must keep aggression in check
