-- the @entity2 mosquito is just two to three millimeters long but its impact is devastating			1
of the thousands of mosquito species , this one bears primary responsibility for one of the world 's deadliest and fastest growing diseases			1
in the past 50 years , incidence of @entity11 has multiplied by 30 according to the @entity12 , spreading from nine countries in 1970 to over 100 today			1
there is no vaccine or cure for the painful virus known as @entity11 , and of the 50 - 100 million people infected each year , over 20,000 die			1
@entity2 has spread with this epidemic , and has become the target of efforts to control the disease			1
but while solutions such as mass spraying of toxic chemicals have proved expensive , ineffective and environmentally damaging , scientists hope to use the insect as the agent of its own destruction			1
@entity32 biotech firm @entity31 is tackling the problem through pioneering genetic modification ( @entity35 ) of the @entity2			1
scientists breed large numbers of the insects in laboratories and inject the sperm cells of males with a lethal gene			1
when the mosquito is released into the wild and mates with a female -- always of the same species - the deadly transgene is passed on and the offspring dies			1
@entity31 report successes from their release of @entity52 ( @entity53 ) programme trials in @entity55 , the @entity56 and @entity57 , claiming a 96 % suppression rate in the latter case			1
this has proved enough for the @entity57 government to announce this year the first commercial release of @entity35 mosquitoes into the wild			1
the treated insects are awaiting approval in the @entity66			1
@entity68 dr. @entity67 claims the techniques the company has been refining since 2009 offers a high degree of control			2
" in the target area we could suppress the population even to zero levels , " he says			2
the engineered males can court and mate wild females and we can suppress the target populations as we demonstrated in the @entity56 and in @entity57			2
to a huge level , enough suppression to prevent epidemic dengue			2
" @entity67 believes the concept could be applied at scale			2
" i hope that it will become a major part of control of major pest insects			2
if we could reduce , even in some countries , the burden of diseases like dengue ... that would be fantastic			2
we 're just at the dawn of genetic control			2
" this approach is being widely adopted			2
researchers at the @entity100 have pioneered a method that renders mosquito offspring unable to fly , making them harmless			1
at @entity104 , a team have suppressed malaria in trials by modifying mosquitoes to only give birth to males , which do not bite and can not transmit the disease			0
dr. @entity112 , co-author of the latter study , uses a mousetrap analogy to illustrate the guarantee offered by genetic transfer			0
" even if one of every 10,000 mosquitoes would not function ... it would not prevent the technology from suppressing populations			0
if you put up 20 mousetraps and one is not working , the remaining 19 would still be able to do the job			0
" the path of modifying mosquitoes has many supporters in the medical community			0
" scientists have made a lot of progress and there are many exciting projects " , says dr. @entity130 of the @entity131			0
" if we can identify a single species which transmits a disease like the @entity2 and dengue fever , ( genetic modification ) can have an impact			0
it 's less achievable for malaria , which is transmitted by many species			0
" although there are still questions to answer , @entity130 wants to see expansion			0
" we need more field trials to show the impact on disease transmission ... i believe we need to push ahead , because the thing about mosquitoes with dengue fever and malaria in the wild is that they are always a step ahead , developing resistance , and we need new forms of novel intervention			0
" but critics believe that implementation of @entity35 mosquitoes is happening too fast without enough understanding of the impact			0
@entity168 @entity32 is demanding a public consultation in @entity57 before the insects are released in the wild			0
" @entity31 have omitted or failed to publish important information needed to make a decision " , says dr. @entity172 director of @entity168 @entity32			1
" the reduction figures from their trials can not be verified and they have not proved a positive impact on disease			0
one problem is that if you reduce numbers of one mosquito species , another may increase			1
" many experts think that suppressing a wild population that is so mobile will not work and may cause actual harm , no one knows for sure but it is certainly irresponsible not to consider the risk			0
" despite such concerns , the trend toward modification of insects for disease control is gathering pace as other solutions fail and regulators are favorable			0
worms , flies and moths are also being targeted and ' weaponized ' against their species			0
as this new battle commences , the stakes could hardly be higher			0

biotech firm @entity31 is tackling @entity11 with genetically modified mosquitos .
when the modified male mosquito mates with a female , a deadly transgene is passed on and the offspring dies .
50 - 100 million are infected with @entity11 each year .
