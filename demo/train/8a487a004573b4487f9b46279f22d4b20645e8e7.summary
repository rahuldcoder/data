@entity0 -- a new generation of creatives are taking code to a more colorful realm , using digital media to push the boundaries of art. they are artists , architects , designers , musicians and game developers and their pioneering work includes interactive sculptures , wearable technology , immersive experiences and works built via crowd - sourcing			1
this expanding artistic frontier is celebrated in " @entity21 , " a new exhibition at @entity0 's @entity23 , a comprehensive survey of digital art from the 1970s to the present day , the exhibition traces the evolution of the digital art community and showcases the work of some of its most innovative practitioners			1
" what we are doing is looking at digital practice across a range of art forms , " said curator @entity33			1
" the exhibition focuses on artists who use code as their material			1
" digital artists come from all kinds of backgrounds , according to @entity33 , and this is one of the show 's key themes			1
" @entity58 , " ( 2012 ) by experimental architecture and design practice , @entity61 , is typical of the interdisciplinary nature of digital art. it features animal - like creatures in the form of robotic arms that interact with the audience by tracking their movement			1
" [ it ] is an interactive sculpture made using code by architects , " @entity33 said			1
" lines are blurred between art forms			1
" interactivity is another key theme , said @entity33			2
" audiences can use their whole body ... you get a level of immersion you ca n't get with traditional art forms like painting , " he added			1
filmmaker and interactive artist @entity78 's large - scale installation " @entity79 " examines birth , life and death by using shadow play on three screens to create a poignant narrative that viewers can interact with			1
the installation uses @entity88 for @entity90 motion sensors , originally designed for the @entity92 video games console , which allow participants to interact with the installation using gestures and commands			1
one screen features a huge pair of wings , which are superimposed onto the participant 's shadow			2
a wave of the arms will furl and unfurl the wingspan , more rapid motion will cause the creature to lift up from the ground and fly			1
" people love to play with the wings ... especially kids			2
it 's cool to see these tiny people with huge wings , " said @entity110 , an artist and programmer , who coded half of the installation			0
" someone came in in a wheelchair ... and you could feel that [ being able to fly ] was special for them , " he added			0
fashion label @entity121 creates interactivity of a different kind with wearable tech : a skirt whose pattern can be changed via an app and which you can send tweets to and a touch telecommunication t - shirt , @entity134 , that allows people send each other cuddles remotely			0
" everything in our lives are connected apart from fashion , which is stuck in the @entity145 , " said co-founder @entity137 who previously worked for @entity139 couture label , @entity140			0
" [ our designs mean you can ] communicate and express yourself in a more interesting way			0
" one high - profile fan is singer @entity151 , who is regularly photographed wearing @entity121 's interactive haute - couture dresses on the red carpet			2
the exhibition also features a number of new commissions including " @entity157 , " a collaboration by musician and technology advocate will.i.am and @entity162 artist @entity161			1
it features three robotic instruments -- piano , drums and guitar -- in the shape of pyramids in front of a huge projection of @entity160 in an ancient @entity173 headdress singing a song written for the installation			0
each robot can be programmed to play music live			0
" we are dreaming about the future of art and technology and the intersection of both , " will.i.am said			1
@entity185 added that the concept was from a " vision of the future of music and music distribution , " adding that it was a response to illegal downloading and the energy that artists spend on live shows			0
" each robot represents a musician ... it 's a way of distributing music in a new way and performing a live concert ... it 's live but mechanical , " he said			2
another new commission is immersive installation " @entity204 , " by @entity0 - based @entity206 who are known for their large - scale mass participatory interactive outdoor events			1
" @entity204 " is their first artwork for an indoor space and they say " it blurs arbitrary distinctions between physical and virtual			0
" the installation features a blacked - out room filled with three - dimensional light fields that visitors can walk through and manipulate with their bodies to create luminous forms and release puffs of smoke and bubbles			2
" we 're interested in the participatory experience and how you can create trust and something bigger than yourself , " said @entity223 , one of the @entity206 artists who created the work			1
" it is actually very revealing of people			0
" " @entity240 " project , a technology that allows people to communicate with the outside world using just their brainwaves is debuted by @entity236 with a specially commissioned video game that allows visitors to try out the technology			0
" @entity240 " uses an eeg or brainwave sensor and eye - tracking technology to enable the fully paralysed to draw and communicate			0
" it is an extension of an earlier project , " @entity253 , " that @entity244 made for graffiti artist @entity245 to allow him to draw again despite suffering from the neuro - degenerative condition , motor neurone disease			0
" he started being able to communicate and started making art with his eye movements including a sculpture , " said one of the designers , @entity254			2
when he started to lose the ability to blink , @entity244 came up with " @entity240 " to allow him to communicate by thought alone			0
" we are interested in the idea of technology for the sake of humanity , " @entity262 , @entity244 ceo said			0
" all these examples [ in this exhibition ] are seeds and we think about how we can reapply them for fundamental social need			2
" it 's a playground ... and we ask ourselves , ' how can we hack that ? ' " read more : would you pay over $ 4 million for an unmade bed ? read more : profoundly intimate photographs from a young @entity277 read more : 13 of the world 's most remarkable miniature hideaways			0
