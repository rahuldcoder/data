-- he 'll be back ... if the script is right			2
@entity5 has given @entity7 agency @entity6 approval to discuss a potential new @entity10 movie with studios , a source close to the star confirms to @entity0 , but until @entity5 sees a script and specifics about the project , he will not fully commit to it			1
director @entity16 ( who helmed this weekend 's " @entity18 " ) is reportedly attached to direct the film , but it does not yet have a screenwriter			1
the rights to the franchise were sold to hedge fund @entity24 last year in a deal worth $ 29.5 million after @entity27 -- which had acquired the franchise in 2007 -- declared bankruptcy			0
@entity30 and @entity31 had attempted to jointly bid for the property , but the bankruptcy judge awarded it to the @entity34 , @entity36 - based hedge fund management company instead			0
the most recent film in the sci - fi franchise , 2009 's " @entity38 , " grossed $ 371 million worldwide , but did not star @entity5 ( although his computer - generated likeness did make a brief cameo in the film 's final act )			1
the former @entity36 governor 's last starring role was in 2003 's " @entity45 : @entity46 " ( global gross : $ 433 million ) , and he continues to be strongly identified with the cybernetic assassin that helped propel him to superstardom			2
@entity0 reported exclusively last month that @entity5 's first post-governor gig would be the animated series " @entity62 , " a play off of the title combining " governor " and " terminator " that became synonymous with his tenure running @entity36 's government before he even had the job			1
" when i ran for governor back in 2003 and i started hearing people talking about ' the @entity62 , ' i thought the word was so cool , " @entity5 told @entity0 last month			2
with so many speculating over what live - action role he will take on first now that he 's left the governor 's mansion , it 's not a huge surprise that while the 63 - year - old is done being governor , he may not quite be done being the terminator			0
