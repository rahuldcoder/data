@entity1 , @entity0 -- " it is like a tsunami has hit here			1
" these were the first words from @entity2 's @entity6 , as she arrived in the storm - battered eastern city of @entity1 on board a military transport plane			1
leading the first international news team into this part of the @entity0 in the wake of @entity14 -- one of the strongest storms ever recorded to hit land -- hancocks and crew hitched a ride from @entity21 with the country 's military , along with members of the @entity25 , the @entity26 , local media and a load of food aid			1
this is her first account of the scenes she witnessed : the damage in @entity1 looks almost identical to that caused by a tsunami			1
as we were flying over the area , it was quite clear there was a lot of water and a lot of destruction			1
the area is flooded and everything i can see has been damaged			2
latest on @entity14 : more than 100 killed in @entity1 the sheer devastation and debris is something i have seen from tsunamis -- i have n't seen damage of this magnitude from a typhoon before			1
every single tree is either flattened or broken off and stripped bare			2
this damage to the trees alone shows the strength of the winds			2
officials tell me the storm surge came as high as the second story of the terminal building here and it clearly has devastated the structure			1
what was once inside the building is now strewn outside			2
helicopters are taking off from the airfield -- this looks like it is becoming a staging point for the relief effort			1
it is hard to get a gauge right now on just how many casualties or how much damage the storm has caused here and across the country			1
in @entity1 , all the power lines are down and the airfield itself is badly damaged			1
the military and the @entity26 are looking for where they should set up areas where residents can come to get assistance			2
this is the initial phase of the relief efforts			1
@entity90 tracker : @entity91 heads to @entity92 there are a lot of residents wandering around looking lost -- they look like they 're not sure what they should be doing			2
it is difficult to know how many people will come to this area			0
the roads are inaccessible and completely cut off			1
there is barely a tree in its entirety standing , blocking roads			1
people are coming to the terminal area as they believe this is where food and water and first aid will be administered			0
the head of the @entity25 told me what they have to do in the first few hours is figure out what they can do -- figure out the lay of the land , where they can get to , where they ca n't get to and that will take some time			0
and that is also a major task facing the military -- getting to the areas they need to get to			0
it is going to take heavy machinery and a lot of work before they can reach those who need help			1
the first challenge will be providing food and water as well as shelter			0
a couple of residents have approached me			0
one , a young man with his baby daughter looked very shell - shocked and very shaken up			0
he was waiting for some medical treatment			0
the medical facilities at this point are very rudimentary but that will change in the coming hours			0
i have also had many people wave and smile at me			0
they are familiar with typhoons -- this country sees more than 20 typhoons each year but not at the level or scale brought on by this storm			2
among the tasks facing relief workers is bringing in food for these people			2
food and water are the main issue facing residents			0
i can see the military right now carrying in tents to certain areas -- for medical purposes or to provide shelter			0
there are some structures that remain intact but they look very dangerous in themselves			0
twisted and unstable -- it is not an ideal situation for people to shelter but there are no alternatives right now			0
are you in the affected area ? send us your images and video but please stay safe			0
