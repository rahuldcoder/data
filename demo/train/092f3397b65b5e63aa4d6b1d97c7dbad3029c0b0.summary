-- as the first president - elect with a @entity4 page and a @entity6 channel , @entity1 is poised to use the @entity7 to communicate directly with @entity8 in a way unknown to previous presidents			1
since the election , president - elect @entity1 has posted weekly video addresses on @entity6			1
judging by @entity1 's savvy use of social - networking sites during his campaign and the interactive nature of his transition team 's web site , @entity8 can expect a president who bypasses the traditional media 's filters while reaching out to citizens for input , observers say			1
" the rebooting of our democracy has begun , " said @entity25 , founder of @entity26 and the @entity28 blog			2
" [ @entity1 ] has the potential to transform the relationship between the @entity8 public and their democracy			1

ireport.com : your chance to ask president - elect @entity1 a question @entity1 has more than 1 million @entity42 " friends " and more than 3.7 million " supporters " on his official @entity4 page -- some 700,000 more than when he was elected in november			1
his campaign also has a database of almost 13 million supporters and their e-mail addresses			0

they even have a name for this ambitious effort : @entity1 2.0			1
" @entity1 has invented an alternative media model , " said @entity0 senior political analyst @entity73			1
" in the old model , the president talks to the people on television [ and ] the people talk back in polls			0
in the new model , communication is online , and two - way			2
" @entity4 , @entity42 , @entity6 and @entity83 did n't exist when @entity84 took office eight years ago			0
but since last november 's election , @entity1 has wasted no time embracing these online communication portals			2
in recent weeks he has taped weekly video addresses and posted them to @entity6 , where most have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times			0
@entity1 's staffers also have stopped posting information to social - networking sites since the election , preferring to reach out to constituents through @entity6 and @entity95 , the official site of the president - elect 's transition team			1

top - rated ideas will be gathered into a briefing book and given to @entity1 after he takes office			2

all hopes that @entity1 and his staff take a similar approach to @entity131 , the president 's official web site			2
the current @entity131 site , operated by the @entity84 administration , contains few interactive features			0
a statement on the president - elect 's transition site says that @entity1 hopes to " use cutting - edge technologies to create a new level of transparency , accountability , and participation for @entity8 's citizens			1
" it 's fitting , then , that @entity1 's inauguration next week could be one of the most watched video events in internet history			0
@entity25 expects that hordes of users will be watching online when @entity1 takes the oath of office , visiting @entity131 and refreshing their browsers to capture the moment the site switches to proclaim @entity1 , not @entity84 , as president			1
as president , @entity1 will likely not just rely on @entity131 but use multiple internet sites and technological tools to build grass - roots support for his agenda , observers say			1
" [ @entity1 ] is using the tools that are available to him today , " @entity124 told @entity0			0
" the next president will be using some of the same tools , and also some tools that have n't been invented yet			0

@entity1 can bypass traditional media filters while reaching out to @entity8
