@entity0 -- problems were reported across the country during the first - ever nationwide test wednesday of the @entity5 , designed to allow the president to address the @entity8 people during a national emergency			1
some television and radio stations did not air the planned 30 - second test at all			1
some that aired it stayed with the signal longer than others			2
there were anecdotal reports of tv stations failing to air the message in @entity0 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and elsewhere			1
the message did not air on a cable channel being monitored in a @entity26 office and in the @entity26 's radio and tv gallery			1
the @entity29 and the @entity30 , which ordered the test , stressed that it was designed to find flaws , and scoffed at reports the system had failed			1
by late wednesday afternoon , an @entity30 official , not authorized to speak on the record , said about one - third of the test participants had filed preliminary reports , and those showed that 80 % to 90 % of the stations received the alert and were able to rebroadcast it , which was the major goal of the test			1
the official called the failure rate of more than 10 % " not insignificant , " but said identifying problems " is why we have the test			1
" he said the glitches were found in all modes of transmission -- broadcast , cable and satellite -- and it was too early to establish patterns			2
" we 'll dig back into it , " he said			2
" the nationwide @entity59 served the purpose for which it was intended -- to identify gaps and generate a comprehensive set of data to help strengthen our ability to communicate during real emergencies , " said @entity57 , @entity30 spokesman , in a released statement			1
" large areas of the country received the test but some areas did not			1
we are currently in the process of collecting and analyzing data , and will reach a conclusion when that process is complete			0
" a @entity29 statement issued shortly after the test made no reference to problems , except to say the agency looks forward " to working with all our stakeholders to improve this current technology and build a robust , resilient and fully accessible next generation alerting system			1
" " i 'm surprised about the amount of trouble i 'm hearing about , " said warning expert @entity84			0
" my overall impression is -- i kind of hoped for better			0
" in the office of @entity89 , a manager of warning systems for the @entity92 , @entity23 , county government , screens " froze up " immediately before the test , @entity89 said			1
when co-workers tried to turn to other stations , they were unable to , and had to " not only power down the tv , but power down the cable box " to restore service to the television , she said			1
a cable industry group said late wednesday that it is in the process of gathering feedback from its member companies			0
" we do know that in many places , the @entity110 flowed through to viewers without a hitch			0
however , we also know that in some places , it did not , " said @entity114 , spokeswoman for the @entity115			0
stations must report the results to the @entity30 within 45 days			1
the @entity30 says it will not release specific test data to the public because broadcasters worry that potentially embarrassing results could discourage participation in future tests , and test data could reveal security vulnerabilities			1
the test was the first " end - to - end " national test , starting with a tone sent from a @entity29 operations center in @entity0 that was relayed to radio stations and then broadcast simultaneously on tv and radio stations in the @entity8			1
the @entity5 is regularly used -- and tested -- to notify communities about tornadoes , child abductions and other events			0
but all previous tests have been local or regional , and involve the voluntary compliance of broadcasters			0
wednesday 's test was the first national test featuring a live " presidential " alert code , which instructed tv and radio stations that the alert took priority over all other programming			1
" i think the biggest reason nobody ever tested it was because of all the concerns of what could happen and what could go wrong , " @entity29 chief @entity150 told @entity1 tuesday			0
" we take a different approach			0
if we do n't test it , we do n't know what we need to fix			2
" while some problems became evident in @entity92 , @entity89 said the failure was not particularly concerning			0
the county of 1.1 million people just east of @entity165 has set up a system of sirens , cell phone alerts , @entity169 , @entity170 and other devices and services to warn citizens about hazards , including releases from area refineries			2
like other warning experts , @entity89 said it is difficult to conceive of an event that would require the president to deliver an emergency warning to the whole country			0
" the whole point of a public warning is to tell people that there 's a public threat , and ( to inform them about ) protective action that you take			0
so if you have an event like 9/11 , what are you going to tell people ? not everybody in the entire country is affected in a real physical sense , " she said			0
" how often do you have that one message that applies to everyone in the country ? " warning systems are of greater value when they are targeted to local communities , she said			0
but the @entity5 could serve as a " last ditch ' reassurance ' that the government is still up and running , " noted @entity206 , vice chair of the @entity207			0
@entity206 called the test " useful			2
" @entity89 and others say an upgraded warning system @entity29 is developing will be of greater reliability			2
" i have pretty good confidence that the next generation is going to work out some of the kinks that we saw today , " she said			0
@entity1 's @entity216 contributed to this report .			2
