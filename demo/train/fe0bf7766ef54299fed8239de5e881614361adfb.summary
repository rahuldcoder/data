on the second and final day of @entity1 's @entity0 " in @entity3 , conversation remained centered on its host			1
after bringing out @entity6 and most of his @entity11 crew on the first night during his headlining set , the @entity8 emcee returned on sunday , joining @entity13 for an airtight , riffing take on his @entity14 cut " 99 problems , " a version of the song only comparable to a 2004 collaboration with @entity18			1
@entity1 's surprise appearance highlighted what was a momentous set by @entity23 's crew			1
over two hours , the rock vets satiated all levels of fans , mixing set staples ( " @entity28 , " " alive , " " even flow " ) with unexpected gifts , including a full ride through the @entity32 cut " @entity33 " and a brief interlude into the @entity36 ' " @entity35 " during the outro of " daughter			2
" a day earlier , @entity1 screened a psa from @entity40 for audience members , urging them to vote in the upcoming election			1
almost exactly 24 hours later @entity23 also dabbled in political gesture : " i want to talk about one of the political parties , " he told the crowd before charging through the @entity48 's protest anthem " @entity49			2
" " i wo n't mention any names , but one of the parties wants to make it harder for you to vote			2
" this sermon followed a @entity23 discourse on the dwindling job market before the appropriately titled " unemployable			2
" @entity59 , wearing a white - on - white jean - and - tank combo , delivered on the unenviable task of warming up the stage for @entity13			1
the @entity63 rapper , who revealed he 's " working on a new one right now , " linked up with @entity11 's @entity65 for a fierce take on the @entity69 rhyme - slinger 's " @entity67 " and @entity72 's day - one absentee @entity70 for " @entity73			1
" the rapper , who got somber during the singsong plea of " @entity76 , " balanced it out with humor ( " you got a tank top on and your nipples are out , " he told an audience member )			1
performing for the first time since the 2002 murder of co-founder @entity1 , seminal hip - hop crew @entity83 reunited for a triumphant sunday afternoon set			1
surviving members @entity88 and @entity87 paid tribute early and often to their late partner ( " @entity1 was everything to us , so we put a silence on the group , " @entity83 explained of the group 's decade - long hiatus ) , even having the late @entity99 's two sons , @entity100 and @entity101 , behind the decks			1
@entity88 , decked out in full @entity104 regalia , made no secret of his elation over returning to the stage : " damn , this feels good , " he said at the start of a 40 - minute set that peaked with " @entity110 " and " @entity111			2
" immediately after @entity83 left the stage , rap 's newest generation of talent was put on display with a set from @entity117 , which featured an abundance of " @entity126 " chants and six of the collective 's rappers , including @entity123 , @entity124 , and @entity125			1
late in the set , @entity123 debuted a blistering , as - yet - unfinished song , sarcastically prefacing it with a false disclaimer : " it 's really calm , " he said			0
it was n't , and @entity117 catalyzed the formation of the only mosh pit @entity135 saw all weekend			0
@entity136 attracted a thin crowd late sunday night at the @entity139 side stage ; today 's punks were nowhere to be found , as the band brought in a markedly older demographic			0
the foursome appeared a little stiff onstage , but aurally speaking , any @entity145 cobwebs were thoroughly dusted off as the band nailed classics like " @entity148 " and " @entity149			0
" earlier in the day , with rain falling intermittently on the crowd , @entity151 -- @entity153 's up - and - coming artist ( and a finalist for @entity135 's @entity155 ) -- looked like a street @entity157 ( think beanie and bangs ) as she wilded out to her forthcoming debut 's @entity162 - inspired , reggae - tinged single " @entity160 " and " @entity163			0
" the @entity167 , wearing their usual top hats and tuxedos , followed @entity169 's performance with an occasionally comical but always full - throttle showing			0
" you got hands , clap them			0
you got a * * es , shake them , " frontman @entity173 instructed the crowd before launching into their new cut " @entity177			0
" one of sunday 's biggest draws was @entity179 , whose set spawned a veritable diaspora toward the @entity182 after @entity59 's main stage performance , siphoning off a considerable number of festivalgoers from @entity136 's set on the nearby @entity187			1
the @entity99 and producer spun crowd - pleasers like his remix of @entity192 's " @entity191 " as his smoke machines were on in full force			0
" we 're going to make it feel like sunshine , " @entity196 native @entity195 promised after inviting a handful of eager fans onstage for " creator			0
" fellow @entity196 singer @entity203 did her part to keep the mood lively , calling on the city 's own eve for a surprise performance of " @entity209 , " a song which had the hometown crowd singing along with every word			0
