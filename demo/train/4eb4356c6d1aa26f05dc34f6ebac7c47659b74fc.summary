a tiny device that can recharge cell phone batteries in as little as 30 seconds won 18 - year - old @entity2 a major science award that will help fund her college education at @entity5			1
@entity2 traveled from her @entity7 home to @entity8 last week for the @entity9 , where her invention was honored as one of two winners of @entity13			1
" i 'm in a daze			0
i ca n't believe this happened , " @entity2 , a senior at @entity15 in @entity16 , told @entity18 affiliate @entity17 5			0
@entity2 's device , a black , rectangular type of supercapacitor just over an inch long , can charge a cell phone battery in 20 to 30 seconds , she said			1
" i developed a new supercapacitor , which is basically an energy storage device which can hold a lot of energy in a small amount of volume , " she told @entity17			1
the technology may also be able to speed up charging of automobile batteries , she said			1
a videotape of the award ceremony showed an ecstatic @entity2 trotting up to the stage when her name was announced in @entity8 , then standing with other winners as the audience at the fair applauded and confetti fell on them			0
the award includes a $ 50,000 prize that will come in handy when @entity2 heads to @entity5 in the fall , she told @entity17 5			1
with a laugh , she predicted that " i will be setting the world on fire			2
" in announcing the winners of what it billed as the " world 's largest high school research competition , " @entity9 cited @entity2 for recognizing " the crucial need for energy - efficient storage devices " as the world rapidly adopts portable electronics			2
the other winner of a @entity59 with @entity2 was @entity60 of @entity61 , @entity62 , who received a $ 50,000 prize for " simulating thousands of clusters of galaxies " to allow scientists to " better understand the mysteries of astrophysics : dark matter , dark energy and the balance of heating and cooling in the universe 's most massive objects , " the @entity9 statement said			2
the top prize at the fair went to 19 - year - old @entity78 of @entity79 , who used " artificial intelligence to create a viable model for a low - cost , self - driving car , " according to an @entity9 statement			0
he received the @entity85 , named after the @entity9 co-founder , which includes a $ 75,000 prize			0
according to @entity9 , more than 1,500 young scientists from around the world were chosen to compete in last week 's fair .			0

@entity7 *teenager* is heading to @entity5 after winning a science prize
@entity2 developed a tiny supercapacitor to speed battery charging
her device could be used for automobile batteries in the *future* , she said
" i will be setting the world on fire , " @entity2 says
