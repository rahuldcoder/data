-- the graphic footage of the wooden boat carrying up to 100 @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 asylum seekers as it wrecked last week on the cliffs of @entity8 has been seen around the world			1
at least 30 bodies have been recovered			0
eighteen are still missing and presumed dead			0
three children have been orphaned			0
the scenes have stunned residents of @entity8 , an @entity15 territory in the @entity16			2
many residents tried in vain to assist those thrown into the sea as their boat broke apart			0
the disaster itself raises serious questions			0
how was it possible the boat could get so close to @entity8 without the @entity15 navy being aware of its pending arrival ? emergency services might not have been as prepared as they should have been			1
a commissioned report by the @entity15 government in january said , " some key island stakeholders such as medical , transport and port authority staff are not informed of the arrival of a vessel until the last possible moment			2
" certainly the navy , which systematically patrols the waters between @entity41 and @entity8 , was caught napping			1
it took an hour and half for a small navy boat to arrive to render assistance			2
but the bigger questions concern the @entity15 government 's asylum polices and the arrival of refugee boats			1
more asylum seekers arrive in @entity15 by plane than by boat			1
there is no hysteria about their arrival			0
they are not routinely detained			0
the 20 pilgrims from @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 who applied for asylum following the @entity65 's @entity64 in @entity66 in 2008 were not branded as " queue jumpers			0
" but boat arrivals elicit a different response			0
subject to mandatory detention on arrival , more than 5,700 asylum seekers -- including more than 800 children -- are in detention centers , with 2,700 - plus on @entity8			1
more than 2,000 have been in detention for more than six months , and that figure is growing			0
refugee boats were a major feature of this year 's federal election			0
both major political parties campaigned on being tough with asylum seekers			2
in the wake of the election , public opinion has shifted against asylum seekers			2
but it is the policies of the @entity15 government that are largely responsible for pushing asylum seekers to get on boats to make the sometimes risky journey from @entity41			1
the tragedy highlights three features of @entity15 's refugee policy that must change			1
first , @entity15 has increasingly pressured the @entity41 government to detain asylum seekers -- whether or not they are mandated refugees under the @entity97 high commissioner for refugees , or @entity98			1
seekers are held in detention centers sometimes funded by the @entity15 government			2
this in itself is a strong incentive for asylum seekers to leave @entity41 as soon as possible			1
second , until this year , @entity15 did not routinely resettle @entity98 refugees from @entity41			1
this year , the @entity15 government said it will take 500 refugees from @entity41 , although , so far , fewer than 100 have been resettled , and the government has not guaranteed numbers for the future			2
it sometimes takes months for @entity98 to register asylum seekers and then more months for those claims to be processed			2
once determined to be refugees , they can wait years for the @entity98 to find a country willing to resettle them			0
understandably , other resettling countries consider asylum seekers in @entity41 to be @entity15 's responsibility			1
the lack of any guaranteed resettlement is another powerful incentive for asylum seekers to take the boat journey from @entity41 to @entity15			1
if @entity15 were willing to process asylum seekers and guarantee resettlement , far fewer asylum seekers would want or need to take the boat journey			1
yet prime minister @entity129 's @entity128 government takes proportionally fewer refugees than was the case under the conservative @entity133 government			0
third , the @entity15 government 's move to criminalize people - smuggling ( and by association asylum seekers themselves ) in @entity41 and @entity15 also provides a powerful disincentive for asylum boats to contact @entity15 authorities should they require assistance			1
a year ago , the @entity15 government called on the @entity41 government to intercept a boat of 253 @entity145 asylum seekers			1
after a standoff at the @entity41 port of @entity149 , the @entity146 were imprisoned at @entity150 , although all but 17 were found to be refugees			0
while the extreme weather may have been the immediate cause of the disaster at @entity8 , just as surely , government policies drove that boat onto the cliffs			2
the pursuit of cheap electoral advantage has motivated successive governments to adopt such punitive policies			0
they behave as if there is a crisis when there is none			0
those policies have cost the lives of at least dozens of people and scarred the lives of thousands of others who have been detained			2
in the @entity8 tragedy , there is also an opportunity for a drastic shift in policy			0
refugee advocates and members of the @entity128 have urged the government to seize this moment to implement a truly humanitarian policy			0
whether @entity15 's political leaders have the courage to make the shift remains to be seen			1
but the lives of future asylum seekers depend on their response			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			0

@entity190 : dozens of asylum seekers die in boat wreck off @entity15 's @entity8
@entity196 : questions raised about response of @entity15 navy , island emergency services
@entity15 pressures @entity41 to detain asylum seekers , so they leave in boats , @entity190 writes
detention policies , *failure* to resettle people lead to tragedies like @entity8 , he says
