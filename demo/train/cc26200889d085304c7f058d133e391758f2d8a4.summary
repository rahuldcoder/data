when @entity2 was a young lawyer in the @entity4 's new @entity3 in the late 1950s , his supervisor told him to drop his membership in the @entity6			1
@entity2 refused , and soon saw his caseload reduced and desk moved into the hallway			1
it would not be the last time @entity2 gave up a prized position for a principle			1
years later , he left @entity13 -- where he had been the first tenured @entity15 - @entity14 professor -- over the lack of any black women on the faculty			1
@entity2 was a legal scholar who broke racial barriers in a career that influenced students , including a young @entity22 at @entity13			1
now @entity2 is in the news , due to a video clip made public by the website of the late conservative activist @entity26 , who died march 1 at age 43			1
@entity26 had promised to release videos of @entity22 as a student at @entity13 that he said would show people " why racial division and class warfare are central to what ' hope and change ' was sold in 2008			1
" the clip made public on @entity26 's website this week shows @entity22 introducing @entity2 at a @entity13 demonstration in 1991			1
@entity22 encourages the crowd to " open up your hearts and your minds to the words of professor @entity2 " and then embraces him			1
to @entity26 and those at his website , the clip proves a connection between @entity22 and a radical academic with an anti-white message			1
they seek to link @entity2 to the rev. @entity51 , @entity22 's former preacher in @entity52 who became an issue during the 2008 presidential campaign because of anti-white pronouncements			1
@entity56 , the editor - in - chief of @entity58 , called @entity2 " the @entity51 of academia " in an interview thursday on @entity60			1
he argues that @entity22 's association with @entity2 and @entity51 shows his leaning toward radical social views , and that such issues need to be fully vetted in an election year			1
" it carries over into his governance because his @entity4 wo n't treat black civil rights violators the same way it treats white civil rights violators , " @entity56 said , adding " there 's a racial pattern in which justice is enforced and it gives us a sense of how @entity22 thinks about these issues			1
" however , many who knew @entity2 through his legal and teaching career express admiration for his life 's achievements and his academic prowess			1
" @entity2 's pursuit of racial and social justice and his dogged critique of liberal incrementalism in universities and elsewhere was like a persistent wind that changed the landscape of law schools and influenced the larger academic world as well , " wrote @entity13 law professor @entity92 and @entity94 professor @entity93 in a remembrance of @entity2 published in the " @entity96			1
" " he worked in so many ways : a mentor to many of today 's leading academics , a master teacher whose commitment to his law students was unquestioned and unmatched , and a provocative scholar and critic , " @entity92 and @entity93 continued			0
" he was a celebrated maverick before that word lost its luster			0
" @entity92 had particular reason to honor @entity2			1
in 1998 , she became the first black women granted tenure as a @entity13 professor , six years after @entity2 's departure over that issue			1
@entity2 was a founder of critical race theory , which examined the intersection of race , power and law in a harsh portrayal of @entity14 society as one dominated by class and racial conflict			1
his book " @entity127 " is taught in civil rights courses today , and those in the legal world offer a more comprehensive description of critical race theory than @entity56 's assertion that it " is all about white supremacy			0
" in their remembrance , @entity92 and @entity93 wrote that critical race theory " challenged liberalism for failing to go far enough in opposing the entrenched interests that historically benefited from the racial caste system that was being dismantled			0
" according to @entity92 and @entity93 , the theory contends that racial liberalism in the 1950s and ' 60s relied solely on litigation as a strategy and focused on " top - down social reform " that emphasized interracial contact to promote tolerance			0
" as @entity2 recognized , that strategy left poor whites haunted by the sense that they had been betrayed by the elites ; at the same time , it enabled them to blame blacks as the beneficiaries of that betrayal , " @entity92 and @entity93 wrote			2
" @entity2 led scholars in many disciplines to see how the interests of middle - and upper - class whites drove social change			2
thus , litigation alone would not produce significantly new and inventive policy solutions			0
" @entity2 challenged the foundations of what he saw as racial injustice with little regard for political leanings or labels			2
for example , the @entity167 obituary on @entity2 noted that he once wrote that the violence from school desegregation in the @entity14 after the @entity173 's landmark 1954 decision in @entity174 made him wonder if an order for equal schools for both races would have been a better outcome			2
@entity92 and @entity93 cited what they called @entity2 's " groundbreaking analysis " of what he labeled the interest convergence dilemma			2
" the interest of blacks in achieving racial equality will be accommodated only when it converges with the interests of whites , " they quoted from @entity2 's writing			2
@entity2 's teaching included the use of narrative structure and storytelling to illuminate and challenge thinking on race , class and gender			1
one of his stories , " space traders , " is a biting political and social satire that @entity201 made into a tv movie starring @entity203			0
it 's about an alien offer to solve @entity14 's economic and energy problems in exchange for removing the nation 's dark - skinned population			0
" @entity2 chose to speak and write in parables , " said @entity210 , a student of @entity2 's who became president of @entity212 , in a eulogy at a memorial service in november			2
" he created his own way of teaching about race through allegorical conversations stripped of pretense and euphemism			0
he examined complex dynamics of behavior through the simple need to hear and tell stories , among the most ancient of human tools			0
" @entity2 also came under criticism in his career			2
@entity14 @entity229 judge @entity228 , a conservative , wrote in the @entity231 magazine in 1997 that critical race theory " turns its back on the western tradition of rational inquiry , forswearing analysis for narrative			2
" " rather than marshal logical arguments and empirical data , critical race theorists tell stories -- fictional , science - fictional , quasi-fictional , autobiographical , anecdotal -- designed to expose the pervasive and debilitating racism of @entity14 today , " @entity228 wrote			0
" by repudiating reasoned argumentation , the storytellers reinforce stereotypes about the intellectual capacities of non-whites			0
" @entity210 , who hired his former professor at @entity212 , said @entity2 was " a seeker and lover of truth , a radical in the sense that he chose to live ethically in a deeply flawed society " and " a scholar who spoke and wrote the truth of his own profound and deeply scarred experience of injustice with honesty and eloquence			2
" " he wrote and spoke with powerful authenticity about race in ways that alienated not only many an adversary but also many a friend , some who even begged for his silence , " @entity210 said			0
" but he knew that the cost of silence to his soul could exceed the sacrifice of good opinion and material goods to himself			0
" to @entity210 , @entity2 " knew that he was meant to strive , to struggle , and to push -- there would be no short cuts			2
" " yes , @entity2 rocked the boat , " he continued			0
" he also shook the tree , yielding fruits of exceptional scholarship that nourished the discipline of law and thousands of colleagues , students and friends , whom he inspired to teach each other the law and to stand up , speak out , and find joy and satisfaction in stretching the boundaries of justice			0
" in particular , @entity210 said , @entity2 " placed his courageous and ardent protests within a crucible of reverence for every human being			0
" @entity92 and @entity93 wrote in their remembrance that @entity2 's ideas and life experiences were inseparable			0
they quoted him from an @entity303 interview in which he described being a civil rights lawyer in the 1960s , flying from town to town to get information on discrimination and then returning to @entity310 to file complaints and litigate the cases			0
" and i thought that my place in heaven was assured , " @entity2 told @entity303			0
only later did he realize nothing would change if local people failed to organize , telling @entity303 : " i am much more humble with regard to my role today than i was as a young civil - rights lawyer			0
