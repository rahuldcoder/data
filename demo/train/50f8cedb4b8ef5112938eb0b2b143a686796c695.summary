" read below to see a sampling of responses from @entity22 users , some of which have been edited for length and clarity : ireporter jd1rymal : good grief			1
... he has an affair			2
the shame , the agony of it all			0
i 'm not talking about his moment ( s ) of weakness , but the blood in the water that the media are feeding on as if they were sharks			0
get over it ! @entity93 : no , i am not surprised by a powerful man having an affair			2
at least twice a year we hear about one of those			0
what amazes me is how in the world someone thinks that they can get away with something like this without thinking about the consequences			0
kardolfin : it is disappointing to hear that @entity3 had an affair , but it 's not the end of the world			1
he is n't the first person to do it and i 'm sure he wo n't be the last			0
it is just a big deal because he was in the presidential race and that it is obviously a negative thing			2
i am disappointed in @entity3 , but i do n't think he is a bad person and i do n't think it will destroy him			1
captain1944 : @entity118 is in @entity119 , @entity59 is , as usual , taking the weekend off , and the @entity120 are on			0
the media needs something to fill up airtime			0
now @entity0 , please , this does not really need to be a 24/7 story			2
cgigante : i still believe in @entity3 ' message			1
he was a true progressive candidate with a shot at winning , and it 's a shame he 'll now be sidelined over an indiscretion like this			0
sure , it 's no good that he was dishonest in his personal life , but i do n't see how it has any bearing on his plans for economic equality and justice in the @entity138			0
@entity139 : this affair in no way affects or concerns anyone other than the three adults involved			2
this should not even be in the news			2
we have no right to judge him or anyone else in matters of love			2
it is not a crime to fall out of love with one person and into love with another			0
love is beyond our control			0
no one knows what causes love to begin or end			0
if we are trying to crucify him for this because of our moral christian values , then we should also not cast stones on him or judge him			2
leave him and his family alone so they can sort this out in peace and dignity			0
thebridge : from my perspective , @entity3 ' affair does not diminish his capabilities or enhance his lack of capabilities as a leader or public representative or any other job other than being a husband			1
however wrong or immoral we may find cheating ( and lying about cheating ) , the truth is that it does not necessarily reflect the other roles individuals have to fill			0
a great mother could also be a cheater or a great judge could lust after women 50 years his junior			2
that said , i think @entity3 is the same @entity3 -- politically -- that we knew before his affair hit the news .			1
