@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 no longer has a monopoly on bitter partisanship			1
much of the nation 's political rancor has spread to statehouses across the country			0
and the weekly demonstrations outside the @entity1 legislature , dubbed " @entity12 , " are only the latest example			1
as they have for three months , liberal activists rallied once again on monday outside the @entity16 - dominated statehouse to protest what they see as an aggressive and fast - moving conservative agenda			1
now the @entity21 , " read one protest sign			0
" it 's about exposing what 's immoral and extreme , " the rev. @entity22 , a key @entity12 leader , said			0
@entity16 leaders in the state just walk past the demonstrators and their posters			1
ever since they won control of the legislature and the governor 's office for the first time in more than a century , they have repeatedly flexed their newfound muscle			1
legislators ' secret abortion bill fuels # vaginamotorcycles just this year , gov. @entity37 and @entity16 legislators have cut unemployment benefits , rejected the expansion of @entity40 under the new national health care law , and moved to change voting laws , to the chagrin of @entity44			1
on the same day of the latest moral monday protest , @entity37 announced a deal to reduce state personal income and corporate taxes			1
another check , @entity44 complain , on the @entity52 checklist			1
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity37 said , " frankly it 's pragmatic , systematic change that 's going to make @entity1 more competitive			2
" @entity37 brushed off criticisms from democrats that he is only pushing a conservative agenda			2
" i have stepped on toes in my first six months in office of the right and the left and the media , " @entity37 added			2
" maybe that means i 'm doing something right			0
" @entity66 abortion restrictions bill @entity44 in the state , who lack any power to pass , sign , or reject laws for the first time anybody in the party can remember , feel that it 's only their toes that @entity37 is stepping on			1
and they accuse the governor and the @entity16 of trying to " turn back the clock			1
" " overall there tends to be a movement , as we would call it , backwards , " @entity44 state sen. @entity80 said			1
@entity37 points to his record as mayor of @entity86 for 14 years as proof he can work with both @entity44 and @entity16			1
but @entity44 lawmakers are waiting for that bipartisan leadership to emerge in @entity0			2
for progressives in a state that helped elect president @entity93 in 2008 , the only recourse is to protest			2
among the thousands of protesters at this week 's gathering , hundreds filed inside the legislative building for a show of force that ended with dozens of well - choreographed arrests			2
@entity101 , a veteran @entity102 monday demonstrator who was arrested at a protest in may , said she traveled to @entity0 again , despite having her first court date this week			2
" what they did with unemployment is wrong			0
what they did with @entity40 was wrong			0
( and ) what they 're doing with abortion , " @entity110 said			0
last week , @entity16 lawmakers in the state @entity115 approved new rules governing the practices of physicians who perform abortions			1
@entity37 has indicated he will sign the guidelines into law , a move @entity44 say would break a campaign promise to stay clear of any new abortion restrictions			2
" absolutely not , " the governor said , insisting the new rules are only a necessary legal update to regulations already on the books			0
" absolutely , that 's a promise kept			0
" the sudden partisan combat in @entity0 is seen as a test to the state 's reputation of both business - friendly and centrist leadership			0
" i think there are people all over the place who say it does n't help to have this much disagreement , " @entity139 political science professor @entity138 said			0
in light of the state 's 8.8 % unemployment rate , @entity37 argues @entity1 needed a jolt of new ideas			1
" they 're fighting to keep the status quo , " the governor said of the demonstrators			1
@entity138 says what 's happening in @entity0 is a continuation of the partisan battles that have moved from @entity3 to statehouse in @entity158 and @entity159 where @entity16 governors have recently pushed through controversial abortion restrictions			1
as in @entity164 and @entity165 , the protests from liberals are having little effect on the legislative process			0
several leaders of the @entity12 movement said they may continue their weekly gatherings beyond the end of the legislative session , knowing full well they are having little direct impact on the laws passed in their state			0
their focus is on next year 's elections			0
" the one thing they do n't want to see is all of us coming together , " @entity22 said			0
@entity2 's @entity181 contributed to this report			0

@entity16 control @entity1 state politics for first time in more than a century

@entity44 accuse @entity16 of " turning back the clock " with *regressive* agenda
