-- with spring break nearing , my mother contacted my father and arranged for @entity5 and me to visit him again in @entity6			1
he suggested that we arrive on a sunday , and since she had a class to teach the next day , she told us that she would drive us as far as @entity9 and put us on a train the rest of the way			1
when we got to @entity13 , she bought us two tickets , and half an hour later @entity5 and i got off at @entity15 and started looking around the little station for my father			1
he was nowhere to seen			1
a middle - aged white couple walked over to us			1
" do you remember me ? " the man asked			1
" i 'm @entity20 , an old friend of your dad 's			1
" " yes , " i said			1
" we met you in @entity23 a long time ago			2
" " i remember it well , " he said			2
" but i had a different wife then			2
" " i 'm his new wife , " the woman said , putting out her hand			2
" i knew you too when you both were little boys			1
" i did n't remember her			2
" where 's @entity33 ? " i asked			1
" he 's under the weather , " @entity20 said			1
" he asked us to pick you up			1
he 'll be at home when you get there			2
" the @entity40 grabbed our duffel bags and took us to their car			2
it was an ordinary sedan , not the @entity45 bus i remembered from @entity46			2
they did their best to make small talk , remarking on how much we had grown and asking how we liked school			2
but it was awkward , and @entity20 no longer matched the matinee idol image i had of him in my mind			2
his hair had gone white and his face was etched with deep wrinkles			2
when we arrived at the apartment , i noticed that the blinds were drawn			2
@entity20 rang the bell and we waited for over a minute before my father opened the door			1
he said hello and gave my brother and me a hug , but his embrace felt weak and he looked tired			1
it took several minutes before he said anything about my appearance			2
" it looks like you 've lost some weight , @entity71 , " he said wanly			2
is that it ? i thought , dejectedly			2
is that all you 're going to say ? i lost eighty pounds and you barely even noticed ? he had prepared sandwiches and iced tea for lunch			2
the @entity40 stayed and chatted while @entity5 and i ate			0
my father smoked and drank coffee and did n't touch anything on his plate			1
when the @entity40 left , he told us that there was n't much to do in @entity6 on sundays but that he had plans to take us sightseeing and to a movie the next day			0
he suggested that we might want to take a nap			0
i was n't tired , so i browsed through the bookshelves in the living room to find something to read			0
i picked out " @entity100 , " by @entity93 , and quickly became engrossed by the opening scenes of the big wedding and the horse 's head in the movie producer 's bed			1
for dinner , he reheated spaghetti he emptied from a plastic container in the refrigerator and made garlic bread in a toaster oven			0
" i remember how much you like garlic bread , " he said			0
@entity5 and i got into our pajamas and climbed into the sofa bed that he had prepared in his upstairs study			0
he kissed us goodnight and went down the stairs			0
i still was n't sleepy , and as i lay awake thinking , i heard the front door open and close			0
where 's @entity33 going ? i wondered			1
is it okay for @entity5 and me to be here by ourselves ? then about twenty minutes later , i heard the door open again and the sound of my father 's footsteps			1
relieved that he was home , i drifted off			0
@entity5 was sound asleep when i awoke the next morning			0
i listened for other noises but did n't hear any			0
i felt hungry , so i rose quietly and tiptoed downstairs to see if i could find something to eat			0
the kitchen in his condo was small and modern , with a little eating counter and bar stool			0
i did n't know exactly what sizes liquor came in , but i could tell that the @entity137 bottle on the counter was the big kind			0
there was still some liquid left in it , but not much , only a tiny bit at the bottom			0
next to it was a pumpkin pie			0
it was the storebought variety in a tin shell , not like the pies my mother made from scratch for @entity150			0
the center had been scooped out , as if by a scavenging animal			0
there were no slices , just an ugly hole in the middle			0
i stood there for a long time , trying to figure out the meaning of what i saw in front of me			0
it reminded me of the still - life paintings in my mother 's big books about @entity166 art , only with a gruesome twist			1
had @entity33 done this ? i wondered			1
did he drink that whole bottle of gin ? was that why he went out at night , to go to a liquor store ? and why would he eat the pie that way ? was he so drunk he could n't even hold a knife and fork ? i heard @entity5 getting up			0
i did n't want him to see the sad tableau , so i hid the bottle and the pie in the back of the refrigerator			0
i made us toast for breakfast , and we sat around waiting for my father to wake up			1
sometime after noon , i smelled cigarette smoke upstairs			0
then there was the sound of a phone being dialed and my father talking in a low voice			1
at last he came downstairs , covered only by a terrycloth bathrobe			0
" i 'm sorry , boys , " he said			1
" i have to leave			0
i 've called your grandmother in @entity193 and she 's going to come to take care of you			1
" " where are you going ? " i asked anxiously			0
" back to the hospital , " he said			1
" i wanted to get well to spend time with you boys , but i 'm sick again and have to go back			1
" he went back upstairs , and @entity5 and i sat there in the living room until sundown , dazed and disappointed , not knowing what to think about what was happening			0
the next day @entity207 arrived , and a taxi came to take my father away			1
he must have been too proud to call my mother , because she only learned what had happened when @entity207 phoned her to make plans to meet at @entity213 's			1
on the train ride to @entity9 , @entity207 tried to keep our spirits up , but i could see how distraught she was			1
" do you know we 're going to @entity166 next year ? " i asked , hoping to say something that would make us both feel better			0
" yes , @entity220 told me , " she said			0
" i think it will be a wonderful experience for you boys			1
" " and what about @entity33 ? " i asked			1
" do you think he 'll be okay while we 're gone ? " there was a long pause before she answered			0
" i do n't know , child , " @entity207 said , " but i want you to pray for him			0
