@entity0 -- to understand how the suspect in the botched terror attack was able to board a plane , you have to understand how the counterterrorism system that president @entity7 says failed is supposed to work			1
the president says the clues were there , and that a fuller , clearer picture of 23 - year - old @entity12 would have emerged if all the bits and pieces had been shared and put together			2
" the warning signs would have triggered red flags , and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for @entity19 , " @entity7 said			2
the president has ordered a top - to - bottom investigation of the failed terrorist attack on christmas day			0
the preliminary report is expected thursday			0
one of the key questions is why was n't the suspect 's visa revoked			1
the suspect , a @entity28 national , was supposedly on the terrorist watch list			1
six weeks ago , his father warned the @entity31 in @entity28 that his son was becoming radicalized and had gone to @entity33			2
the father provided the embassy with his son 's name , birth date and passport number			1
that information was sent in a routine , unclassified cable known as a visa viper to the @entity43 in @entity0			1
the details in the cable were " insufficient for this interagency review process to make a determination that this individual 's visa should be revoked , " state department spokesman @entity44 said			1
in the aftermath of the attempted attack , the @entity51 is directing embassies to include information on whether a person has a @entity19 visa when it sends the visa viper cables to @entity0 , a state department official said			2
the change was prompted by the preliminary reviews @entity7 ordered due to him thursday			0
the information the father provided the embassy with was just one of hundreds of reports , and often vague tips , coming in each day			2
analysts from the @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and other agencies are supposed to evaluate such tips @entity74 , running them through databases , comparing them with other clues agencies have gathered , and those still coming in			0
the purpose is to make sure the even seemingly insignificant dots get connected			0
the @entity19 also had intelligence that between august and october of this year , extremists in @entity33 were talking about operations			0
someone known as " the @entity28 " was mentioned , and they had a partial name -- @entity12			0
" at any point along that chain , people have the responsibility for making sure that they are accurately and fully reporting what they 've learned			2
and then there are going to be some judgments that have to be made about whether and what action ought to be taken , based on the information , " said @entity92 , former homeland security secretary under president @entity93			0
but in this case , with no urgency attached , the father 's warning was treated more as a missing - person report			1
with nothing else alarming coming up , the analysts put the suspect on the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) list , along with 550,000 other suspicious people			1
and that 's where the warnings stopped			1
to go on to the next step and put someone on a no - fly list or subject them to a secondary screening , there has to be a " reasonable suspicion " of a link to terrorism			1
under the @entity43 rules , the evidence against the bombing suspect was n't there			1
no recommendation was made to the @entity51 to revoke @entity12 's visa			1
the threshold for taking action is being looked at in the review ordered by the president			0
the threshold could be made less restrictive to allow a quicker trigger for action such as revoking a visa , according to a source briefed on the review			2
there was " not a lack of information collected , but a lack of understanding of what to do with that information , " the source said			0
@entity92 said that during his time in the job , there was a " very good information - sharing system			0
" " i think what the current administration is going to be looking at is , was there human failure , either in the initial reporting or in the initial decision about what would be sent up the chain of communication , or in the ultimate determination by the intelligence community about whether this was significant enough to warrant preventing this person from getting on an airplane , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0

despite warnings , suspect 's visa was not revoked
tip from suspect 's father sent to @entity43
suspect put on @entity106 list , along with 550,000 other *possibly* suspicious people
to take matters further , there has to be a " reasonable suspicion " of a link to terrorism
