-- by day , tens of thousands turned out in cities across @entity3 -- demanding the ouster of president @entity5 , calling for major economic and political reforms and , in multiple spots , bloodily clashing with police forces			1
by night , with the security forces seemingly disappeared , some had stepped back to mourn those killed , treat their wounds or gather strength			0
other citizens , meanwhile , gathered whatever weapons they could find as they banded together with friends , family and neighbors to protect their communities from roving bands of looters			2
" there 's no army , no one to prevent ( theft and chaos )			2
they disappeared , " said one man from a @entity29 suburb on saturday night , who united with friends , cousins and neighbors to protect their property			1
closer to the capital 's center , as well as in @entity39 and @entity40 , the main events earlier saturday were turn - outs by tens of thousands of demonstrators			1
for the fifth straight day , they held up signs and shouted for an end to @entity5 's 30 - year reign , unsatisfied with his newly shuffled government			1
" what 's happened to our president ? " said one woman in @entity29 , wearing a black veil			1
" we do n't want him ( because ) he 's responsible for all this			2
" but her anger was tempered by satisfaction that people had turned out , in such large numbers , to express their views after decades of silence and suppression			0
" i am happy , " she said			0
" i feel yes , we can change			0
" in @entity39 , protests have gained strength during the course of the week			1
throngs chanted saturday , " we want him out , we want him gone , @entity5 has to go			1
" one demonstrator told @entity0 's @entity66 that @entity5 , after an early saturday speech signaling his intent to reorganize his government but stay in power , was trying to challenge demonstrators			1
he said his decision to implement a curfew , which extended from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. , was irrelevant and suggested that the opposition is only getting stronger and bolder			0
" he can not order us , he 's not the president anymore , " the man said			1
" he wants to calm us down by saying he will stay			0
that is not calming us down			0
" there were also tears saturday , the result of mounting casualties from sporadic confrontations between demonstrators and police			1
at one point , the body of a man , apparently killed while trying to approach the @entity89 , was carried through the streets , wrapped in an @entity3 flag			0
also in @entity29 , a mosque was turned into a makeshift clinic			1
there , a handful of men came in with wounds from what appeared to be rubber pellets fired by police , they told @entity0 , and at least 31 people were killed in @entity39 , @entity3 , hospital authorities told @entity0			1
besides civic discontent and violence , general lawlessness was also pervasive -- especially in areas outside the city centers , which were largely free of any police or military presence			1
looters , some sporting swords and riding motorcycles , had infiltrated numerous public and private buildings			0
while there were reports of a large gun battle saturday night , they largely went unbothered by security forces , though not as often by residents			2
fires could be seen in several @entity29 neighborhoods , set by people paying no heed to the government - imposed curfew			1
people also continued to roam the streets , in what was in some ways one of the quietest nights since the protests began earlier this week			0
an increasing number of residents , fearful given the apparent absence of any official security apparatus , had taken matters into their own hands			0
they worked together to set up barricades around some streets			0
many -- including the wife of @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity142 -- handed out clubs , kitchen knives and whatever other implements they could find to trustworthy men and teenagers who could help ward off looters			0
this sense of community and desire for protection was evident early sunday outside the famed @entity155 , home to @entity156 and other milllenia - old relics of the nation 's storied past			1
@entity161 tanks surrounded the museum , with some soliders standing inside its garden			2
in front , mostly euphoric civilians stood arm - in - arm -- in solidarity with the military and in defense of some of @entity3 's greatest treasures			1
still , there was also ample evidence of chaos and destruction			0
numerous police stations had been burned and ransacked			2
and private businesses also were hit , including several shops in an upscale @entity29 neighborhood			2
residents said they were worried about possible anarchy and prisoners escaping from jails			0
others told @entity0 they worry that the chaos is president @entity5 's strategy -- that all the crime could turn people against the protesters , and build favor for the government security forces to restore order			1
@entity196 , a resident of @entity29 , said he saw people burning cars and taking parts from a junkyard			2
he said the police had withdrawn or were otherwise occupied , while the @entity161 was downtown , leaving community members to work together or fend for themselves to protect property			2
" we have all become vigilantes , " he said			0
" basically , it 's like the @entity208			0
where is the security ? " @entity0 's @entity142 , @entity66 , @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report .			0
