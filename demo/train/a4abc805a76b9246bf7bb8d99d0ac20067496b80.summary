so , @entity1 and @entity2 have joined forces to take the @entity5 movie franchise in " a new creative direction , " with the next installment planned to hit theaters in july 2017			1
that 's right -- another " @entity5 " reboot , announced just nine months after @entity5 's last swing through theaters in " @entity13 " and three years after the franchise 's first relaunch			1
again ? already ? seriously ? according to the @entity17 , star @entity16 is not returning as @entity5 , freeing the producers of the next movie to cast a new face			0
ok , so maybe @entity1 and @entity2 are eager to purge the sour aftertaste of the last " @entity5 " movie , which was savaged by fans and critics alike			1
but even by @entity27 's increasingly impatient time frame for relaunching superheroes , this move feels awfully hasty			0
the @entity29 , usually awash in enthusiastic fanboys , was skeptical			0
" we 're < 10 years away from a @entity5 movie that reboots itself during the movie , " tweeted @entity32 culture reporter @entity31			0
by tuesday afternoon , @entity37 jokesters were rallying around the hashtag # @entity38			0
and among fans another theme emerged : if they 're going to reboot " @entity5 " again , maybe it 's time to get more creative with casting			1
some people are clamoring for new movies based on an alternate version of @entity5 by @entity2 that replaces @entity5 -- the hero from the original 1962 comic -- with @entity49 , a teenager who is half @entity50 , half @entity51			1
monday 's deal between @entity53 and @entity55 's @entity54 allows them to share @entity5 , meaning that the web - slinging superhero could also appear in movies with , say , @entity58 or @entity59			2
whichever way @entity1 and @entity2 go , there 's a lot of money at stake			1
the five " @entity5 " movies have earned more than $ 4 billion worldwide , making it the most successful franchise in the history of @entity53			2
but people may be wearying of the series in its current form			0
each of the last four " @entity5 " movies made less money than its predecessor			2
we understand that risk - averse @entity27 loves superhero movies , which earn big profits in overseas markets , jump - start lucrative franchises and sell lots of related merchandise			0
but rushing out another , similar " @entity5 " could come across like a creatively empty cash grab			0
would n't it be better for @entity1 and @entity2 give @entity5 a break ? that way they could give fans time to breathe , build anticipation for a reimagined character and take the series in a bold new direction that reflects 2020 , not 1962 .			1

@entity1 is *teaming* with @entity2 and rebooting the " @entity5 " movies again
some fans were saying it 's too soon for yet another relaunch
others are urging @entity1 to reimagine the character with a new *ethnic* identity
