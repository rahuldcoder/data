@entity1 , a dour @entity33 used to the physical demands of 1970s and ' 80s football , ruefully reflected on the decisions of referee @entity37 , who officiated at the 2010 @entity39 final in july			0
" the penalty is a joke			0
i have seen the replay and unless they have changed the rules , it is no penalty , " he told reporters following his first match as a manager since leaving @entity47 club @entity46 in 2000			2
did @entity8 make the right decision ? " the other one , i can not see that as a red card either			2

the @entity121 side went into the match in the worst run of league form since owner @entity125 took over in 2003 , but had few problems in setting up a clash with @entity83 as they seek to become the first team since the 1880s to win the cup three times in a row			0
