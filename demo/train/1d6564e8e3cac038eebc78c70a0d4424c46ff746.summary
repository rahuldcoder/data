-- in a surprisingly close race , " @entity1 and the @entity2 -- part 1 " held on to its box - office crown friday by grossing $ 20.8 million , according to early estimates			1
that 's a 66 percent drop from the fantasy film 's opening last friday , which was inflated due to an enormous turnout at thursday midnight screenings			1
if " @entity2 " follows the @entity15 trajectory of " @entity1 and the @entity16 " -- the last @entity1 film to open in november -- the @entity13 movie should finish the weekend with about $ 50 million			1
that would bring " @entity2 ' " 10 - day tally to $ 220 million , making it the 10th greatest 10 - day gross in box - office history and the best ever for a @entity1 flick			2
but friday was n't only a celebration for wizards , as @entity27 's animated musical " tangled " came in close behind with $ 19.7 million			1
the @entity13 movie , which debuted wednesday , has grossed $ 39.7 million so far , and has a shot at overtaking " @entity2 " for the three - day weekend			1
if that happens , it 'd be due to one reason : incredible word - of - mouth			0
@entity35 audiences rated the fairy - tale film an " @entity37 " -- the first movie this year to garner the rare grade			2
even more impressive is the fact that while moviegoers under the age of 25 rated " tangled " an " a , " those over the age of 25 gave it an " @entity37			2
" clearly this retelling of @entity47 is delivering for all age groups , and when that happens , watch out			0
" @entity52 " is on pace to finish second this weekend with about $ 47 million , but again , it could very well upset @entity1 for first place			2
seems the lesson here is : never underestimate a woman with ridiculously long hair			0
the next five films are fairly clumped together , and their positions could swap by sunday night			0
@entity62 's " @entity61 " came in third on friday , grossing $ 5.3 million for an actual increase of 41 percent from last week			1
in fourth place was the action thriller " unstoppable , " which gained 13 percent from last week for $ 4.6 million			1
after that were this week 's three other new releases			0
the @entity69 - @entity68 musical " burlesque " fared best , bringing in $ 4.5 million on friday			2
despite mediocre reviews , audiences liked the @entity13 film -- @entity35 moviegoers graded it an " a-			0
the r - rated romantic comedy " @entity80 , " starring @entity78 and @entity79 , was next in sixth place with $ 3.8 million			0
