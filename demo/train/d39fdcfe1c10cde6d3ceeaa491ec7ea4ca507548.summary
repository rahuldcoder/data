-- @entity1 remembered being left in the @entity3 snow			1
how he lost his lower arms and some of his toes , he was n't always sure			1
at times , he said he was in a fire			0
the truth of what the 14 - year - old experienced in his early years , no one will ever know			1
the orphanage where he lives said @entity1 was abandoned as a small child at a hospital in @entity16 , @entity3			1
he had gangrene , the result of meningitis and an infection , which forced amputations			0
he was released to the orphanage in @entity23 , where he 's waited nine years for parents and a home to call his own			2
on saturday , @entity26 and his wife , @entity27 , will leave their @entity29 , @entity30 , home to fly to @entity3 , the final step in a 15 - month journey they hope will give the boy what he 's always wanted			1
" having never seen him and only knowing a little bit about him , i still feel attached to that child , " said @entity26 , 53 , who already has six children , four of them adopted			2
" i understand he can talk his way into your heart and mind in no time			0
when the world is opened up for him , who knows what his capabilities and possibilities are ? ... if all goes well , on the 21st he becomes my son			2
" it is a trip the @entity51 will take with trepidation			0
the actions thursday of a @entity55 woman who put her adopted 7 - year - old son on a plane and returned him to @entity3 , saying he was violent and that officials misled her family , puts @entity61 in the process of adopting from @entity3 on edge			1
officials in @entity65 have threatened to suspend all @entity61 adoptions and the @entity51 face a two - week process involving a court appearance and loads of paperwork before they can fly home with @entity72			1
" what this woman did to us is put us on pins and needles , " @entity26 said			0
" my wife has been beside herself , and i 'd be lying if i said i was n't concerned			2
" the adoptions of about 3,000 @entity3 children by @entity61 are in progress , according to @entity81 , president of the @entity82 , an advocacy group for children in need of families			1
@entity3 is the second country this year , after @entity86 , in which adoptions have been thrown into a tailspin			1
no suspension has been announced , but mere talk of such a recommendation spawned a campaign on monday by the council to galvanize the adoption community and child advocates			0
people are being encouraged to sign a letter to president @entity98 and @entity3 president @entity99 ( which will be presented to them wednesday morning ) , post blogs and share videos about adoption successes			1
" our message is this is an isolated incident			0
the adoption system did not fail			0
what failed was the decision - making process of this adoptive mother , " @entity81 said			2
what @entity108 of @entity55 did is " outrageous and indefensible , and not indicative of the average adoptive parent			1
one - hundred - thousand people adopt every year			1
i do n't know of another case like this			1
" the case has rocked the adoption community			2
" i talked to parents yesterday , and they 're just devastated , " said @entity117 , a child and family therapist , trainer and author , based in @entity120 , @entity121 , who has 20 - plus - years experience working on attachment , trauma and grief issues			2
" it makes it seem like these kids are defective , that adoption itself is not a permanent status			0
... it 's a public embarrassment , " she said			0
" the vast majority of families are enriched by adoption			2
to have this kind of approach is really off the wall			0
i ca n't understand why it would have gotten to this point			2
" adoptive parents can feel overwhelmed during transition she and other advocates said they wish @entity108 had reached out for assistance and tapped services available for parents before shipping the child back to @entity3 after six months			1
" there are so many services that were available to her			0
she could have contacted @entity158 [ families for @entity3 and @entity159 ] which is a resource - rich place , gotten a good psychiatric assessment , including hospitalization if necessary to figure out what made this little guy tick , " @entity117 said			1
the incident may have been a wake - up call to agencies and those in the adoption community to make sure adoptive families are prepared for challenges and have resources for help lined up in advance , especially if they live in rural parts of the country , said @entity178 , national chair of families for @entity3 and @entity159 , a volunteer - led nonprofit that offers support and community			1
@entity178 , who adopted a son from @entity65 in 2001 , said there are between 600,000 and 800,000 orphans in @entity3 , with an additional 80,000 to 100,000 in hospitals awaiting placement in orphanages			1
" when you slow adoptions , you affect a lot of children , " she said			2
" there 's lots of angst in the adoption community			0
the minute you see the picture of that prospective child , that kid is yours			0
" being a parent , child advocates and members of the adoption community add , means helping a child adjust to change and work through challenges			0
" this is just so sad because that kid had no chance whatsoever , " said @entity207 , who directs a @entity210 , @entity209 , adoption agency and serves on the board of the @entity212			0
" a 7 - year - old who changed his whole life within six months -- new language , new food , a new mother -- no question he would have issues			2
even a dog would have issues			0
" in addition to hoping adoptions continue uninterrupted , many also want @entity108 punished for her actions			1
@entity230 is the founder and director of @entity232 in @entity233 , @entity234			0
the agency , established in 1992 , helps orphans with special needs ( including @entity72 ) , with adoptions being part of its work			2
" the mother who finds somebody on the @entity244 , who sold his services for $ 200 in order to pick up and deliver [ him ] ... in @entity3 , demonstrates serious neglect and abandonment , " she said			1
" there was a very high risk that the child could have been met by a pedophile or worse , a killer			0
the community in @entity3 is outraged by the fact that the mother may not be punished at all for her inhuman action			1
" prospective adoptive mothers like @entity260 of @entity261 , @entity30 , hope she , her husband , @entity263 , and the boy they want to adopt are n't punished because of @entity108 's actions			1
leaving @entity16 , @entity3 , on friday , @entity266 was overwhelmed with joy and anticipation			1
the 40 - year - old fundraiser and her husband had just spent a week bonding with a little boy they are on track to soon call their own			2
the hopeful first - time parents arrived armed with toys to engage little @entity277 , who will turn 1 later this month			1
in awe and with hearts melting , they watched as the child teetered into the room , clasping the hands of an orphanage caregiver			0
of all the toys they brought him , stacking balls and cars included , his favorite item : @entity291			0
though he was a little reluctant at first , he warmed up during their stay			0
when they left him , he waved his arms to say goodbye			0
in six to eight weeks , they have plans to return to @entity3 to appear in court , the next phase in their journey to become parents			1
" we 've been working on the process for close to a year			1
it 's been one procedural thing after another			0
... we are so prepared to be parents and have worked so hard to get to this point , " she said			0
" we 're hoping that since we 've been to @entity3 once that we 'll be allowed to continue			1
we 're trying to go with a lot of faith and prayers at this point that it 'll all work out			0

about 3,000 @entity61 families are in the process of adopting from @entity3
actions of @entity55 mom , who returned adopted son to @entity3 , has them worried
@entity65 officials threaten to suspend adoptions ; hopeful parents move forward
advocate : " 100,000 people adopt every year . i do n't know of another case like this "
