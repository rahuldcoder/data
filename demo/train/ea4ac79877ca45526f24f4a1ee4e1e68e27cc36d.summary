-- the 2013 tennis season may only be in its fledgling stages but already the heat is well and truly on for those preparing for the year 's first major			1
as the great and good on the men 's and women 's circuits fine tune their game ahead of the @entity7 that starts in @entity8 on monday , they are having to contend with stifling temperatures in @entity14			1
according to the @entity16 @entity15 , monday was the hottest day in the country since records began over 100 years ago with an average temperature of 40.3 degrees			1
officials in @entity21 have warned of a " catastrophic " fire threat as strong winds combine with the heat to increase the danger of bushfires spreading out of control			2
players had to battle heat that reached 41.4 deg in @entity14 , with world no. 4 @entity30 claiming it was " too hot " to play and that officials should have halted proceedings under their extreme heat policy			1
but the @entity35 , along with the other players scheduled on tuesday , battled through the searing sunshine with the help of regular breaks , ice towels and gallons of liquid			2
" i think this is too hot to play tennis , " @entity30 told reporters at a press conference			1
" even for players , for ball kids , for even the people sitting out there , i think it 's just too hot			1
" one saving grace for @entity30 was her quick 6 - 4 6 - 3 victory over @entity54 's @entity53 which meant she was only on court for 68 minutes			1
@entity57 's @entity56 battled through to a 7 - 6 1 - 6 6 - 2 victory over former world no. 1 @entity59 , though both players benefited from a heat break before contesting the deciding set			1
@entity56 told reporters : " i think it shows you one more time how tough the tennis is right now			2
how players have to be fit to play in the hot conditions , the windy conditions			1
we 're like iron women almost			0
" it was very hot out there			0
in the second set the heat definitely disturbed me a lot			0
but the break really helped me before the third set			0
" the @entity80 champion , @entity79 of @entity81 , was quoted as saying by @entity82 that she felt like she was " playing in a sauna			0
" @entity85 's @entity84 triumphed 6 - 2 7 - 5 over @entity57 qualifier @entity86 who took a medical time out because of the extreme heat			0
@entity84 : " it was unbelievably hot			0
usually i practice before my matches , 30 to 35 minutes , today it was just 10 or 15 minutes because i could n't play more			0
it 's tough to play in these conditions			2
" i was trying to focus on the next point and not thinking about the heat , the sun and the weather			0
the whole match was tough from the first point			0
i 'm happy i won in two sets			0
" temperatures were due to cool off for wednesday 's play but by the end of the week the thermometer will be back up to 37 degrees in @entity8 , according to @entity106 from the @entity107			1
she told @entity0 's @entity109 show : " we do see this every couple of years but this is record - breaking heat			2
monday has been confirmed as the hottest day across @entity16 since records began			1
" it looks as if tuesday , once we get the stats in , could be the hottest day and outdo monday			2
" what has happened in the last few hours is a front has come through across the south east of @entity16			2
in literally an hour the temperature in @entity14 has dropped more than 10 degrees			1
" @entity8 is cooler than that as the front went through there first			0
but in @entity8 by the end of the week the temperature is going to rise again , getting well above average			0
