@entity0 still remembers the day when her joy at the prospect of giving birth to her first child turned into sheer terror			2
it was december 15th , 1957 when she went into labor at a hospital in @entity11 , @entity12			1
as she floated in and out of consciousness , she remembers being taken into a room with a single bed			2
" i was pulled to the bottom of the bed			2
my legs were strapped into stirrups			2
i was nine months pregnant , flat on my back , " she says			2
" i was helpless and i did not know what was going to happen			2
" " [ then ] i got a local anesthetic and the torture began			2
" as a room full of medical students and doctors looked on , @entity0 says she could feel the pressure of a scalpel cutting into her			2
from then on , it was " just agony , literally agony , " she recalls			2
" i got a cramp down my left side and i could not move at all to get myself any relief			1
" @entity0 , struggling against the searing pain , could n't see what the surgeon was doing to her			2
she assumed he was performing a caesarian section , but he was n't			2
he was slicing into her pelvis to make way for her baby			2
@entity0 , now 88 , was undergoing a symphysiotomy -- a procedure seldom used by other industrialized nations by the mid- 20th century as @entity47 sections became safer			1
@entity48 is a surgical procedure whereby the pubic symphysis -- the joint that holds the pelvis together -- is cut in order to widen the birth canal during labor			1
roughly 1,500 women in @entity12 were subjected to symphysiotomy between the 1940s and 1984 , according to the government			1
the procedure can cause chronic pain and " rupturing of the bladder , " which can lead to incontinence , according to @entity12 physiotherapist @entity64			1
in cases where the pubic symphysis is completely severed , patients may get " earlier onset arthritis and joint degeneration , " @entity64 says			2
" the mechanics of your whole lower half of your body are changed because of that joint			0
" @entity0 says she never consented to the procedure , which she says has left a permanent gap in her pelvis			1
the operation amounts to torture , according to survivors who have demanded an official apology from the @entity12 government and an independent inquiry			1
" above all , women want the truth about these operations			1
they have been denied the truth for 40 , 50 , 60 years , " says @entity87 , the chairwoman of survivors of @entity48 ( @entity89 )			0
a brief filed by the survivors ' group to the @entity94 @entity93 recounted some of the mothers ' horrifying experiences under the knife			0
" i just remember being brought into a theatre and the place was packed with people			0
i was n't told what was happening ... i was screaming and being restrained , " recalled @entity103 , a pubiotomy patient and @entity89 member who recalled the birth of her third child in 1959 , at the same hospital where @entity0 had given birth two years before			1
" i could n't see much except for them sawing			0
it was excruciating pain , " she said			0
" i was just 27 and i was butchered			0
" @entity112 , another @entity89 member , says she was just 17 when doctors performed a pubiotomy ( a procedure related to symphysiotomy ) on her during the birth of her first child in 1972			1
it 's not working , [ the anesthetic ] i said , i can feel everything ... i seen him go and take out a proper hacksaw , like a wood saw ... a half - circle with a straight blade and a handle , " she said			0
" the blood shot up to the ceiling , up onto his glasses , all over the nurses ... then he goes to the table , and gets something like a solder iron and puts it on me , and stopped the bleeding			0
... they told me to push her out			1
she must have been out before they burnt me			0
he put the two bones together , there was a burning pain , i knew i was going to die			0
" campaigners have accused the doctors , who worked primarily in @entity147 hospitals , of putting their religious beliefs before the well - being of patients			1
" the surgery was an abuse of power , a pre-emptive surgical strike against the practice of birth control by obstetricians who disliked caesarean section , on account of its association with what @entity161 [ of @entity162 ] @entity160 termed the ' crime of birth - prevention , " @entity87 wrote in 2012			0
@entity160 was @entity161 until 1972 and died the next year			0
@entity1 reached out to @entity12 's @entity166 for comment and was referred to the government - commissioned inquiry from 2013			1
that report acknowledged the influence of religion on obstetricians in a @entity147 country where birth control was illegal from 1935 to 1980			0
it notes that @entity177 and @entity178 -- the doctors who championed the procedures at @entity11 's @entity181 in the 1940s and 50s - were " devout @entity183 , serving a predominantly @entity147 patient population , and they made no secret of their willing conformity to religious precepts in the treatment of patients			1
" but the report also acknowledged the legal limits on medical practitioners at the time			0
" whatever their personal inclinations or beliefs , doctors practising in @entity12 were confined by key legislative limits in relation to family planning and advice , " the report noted			1
the @entity94 @entity93 last summer asked @entity12 to conduct a " prompt , independent and thorough " inquiry into symphiosotomy			1
in july , as a result of the government - commissioned inquiry , @entity12 launched an " ex-gratia " scheme -- one that allowed for payment without admission of liability -- to compensate victims with payments ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 euros , depending on the severity of the case			1
but @entity87 says the government 's offer does n't do nearly enough for women who were physically and emotionally crippled by the procedures at state hospitals for decades			1
" that is a sum of money that anybody would get here if they broke a leg at work , " she says			0
" it seems to us that what the state is trying to do is buy off survivors at the lowest possible cost , " she says			0
" the payment scheme is an ex-gratia scheme , which does not meet international human rights standards because it is based on no admission of wrongdoing			0
" she says some women are pursuing legal action			1
@entity0 , one of the roughly 300 victims who is still alive , is not among those looking to the courts			1
and although she did n't find out about what had happened to her for decades , she says she has felt the effects of her symphysiotomy since the day it happened			1
when @entity0 left the hospital , she says she could barely walk for the first six months , and she had to move back home to @entity251 in north @entity12 so her parents could help raise the baby			1
" to walk or to lift the baby , my back would just go into a spasm , and my legs would n't work , " she says			0
" basically you were crawling around holding on ... and that lasted for a long , long time			0
" as bad as the pain was , @entity0 claims that she was n't told about the procedure , and says that " secrecy " hurt even worse			1
" he was obviously sawing me in half , " she says			0
" why they could n't come and tell me ? " " it left me feeling guilt and it left me wondering on what effect it would have on my baby later in life			1
it was having a very bad effect on me so it was bound to have some effect on the baby			0
" " it never dawned on me that there was an alternative , " she says			0
" but i think i would have taken the @entity47			0
" before @entity0 lost consciousness on that terrifying night at the hospital more than 57 years ago , she recalled the surgeon telling a student , " when she has a fine baby boy or girl in the morning , she will forget all about it			0
" but she says she ca n't erase the devastating impact of her symphysiotomy			1
" it has been a lifetime , " she says			0
" it 's been a life sentence			0

1,500 women in @entity12 were subjected to symphysiotomy operations from the 1940s to 80s
victims say the procedure , *administered* during *childbirth* , left them with broken pelvises and *lifelong* injuries
some women were never consulted or told about the procedure ; campaigners want an official apology
