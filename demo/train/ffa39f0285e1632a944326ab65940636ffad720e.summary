@entity43 's phone calls suggested he had disengaged with violent extremism and was focusing on counterfeiting clothing and shoes			0

recruits were told to return home and avoid any appearance of radicalization			0
" and that is what @entity88 had asked me for in the past to get brothers , i.e. , @entity99 terrorists , to get them over , " storm told @entity81			0
" but the condition was that they had to have a clean passport and they had to have a clean name			0
they do not have to be under any sort of radars or surveillance or interest by the government			0
so , they had to be totally clean from that			0
