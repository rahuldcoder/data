honoring the legacy of a former president he 's barely mentioned previously , president @entity1 on thursday cast @entity4 's push to end legal segregation as a factor in his own ascension to the @entity8			1
@entity1 joined three other living presidents in marking the 50th anniversary of the @entity11 , and the movement that spurred its signing , at @entity4 's presidential library in @entity15			1
the landmark measure , signed in 1964 , made it illegal to discriminate based on race , outlawing for the first time segregation at lunch counters , buses , and other public spots			2
" because of the @entity26 , because of the laws president @entity4 signed , new doors of opportunity and education swung open for everybody , " @entity1 said			1
" they swung open for you , and they swung open for me			0
and that 's why i 'm standing here today -- because of those efforts , because of that legacy			2
" @entity4 , the nation 's 36th president , became an unlikely hero to the civil rights movement by using his stores of political capital to pressure lawmakers to pass the legislation -- an effort initiated by president @entity45 and continued by @entity4 after @entity45 's assassination			0
@entity4 was n't above horse trading and flattery to achieve his goals , @entity1 said			2
" passing laws was what @entity4 knew how to do , " @entity1 said			2
" no one knew politics and no one loved legislating more than president @entity4			0
" @entity4 's descendants hope to turn his legacy toward that of a civil rights pioneer , rather than the president who presided over the @entity61			0
the fight was personal for @entity4 , who 'd grown up in the @entity63 amid racial inequality			0
the four - day @entity65 in @entity15 was meant partly to change shift @entity4 's legacy toward civil rights			2
legends of the movement like rep. @entity71 and singer @entity72 appeared directly ahead of @entity1			2
music played before the event — @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 — evoked the tumult of the era			0
@entity1 has said as the first @entity82 - @entity81 president that he 's indebted to civil rights leaders , though during his time in office he has not spoken frequently about his place in the movement 's history			1
he 's spoken even less about @entity4 's legacy			0
thursday 's speech marked one of the first times he 's even made reference to a predecessor who had a long career in the @entity95 and served in the @entity8 from 1963 to 1969			1
other predecessors — including republicans @entity97 and @entity99 — have all been used in speeches more often			0
that changed during @entity1 's remarks , which effusively praised a man whose major pieces of legislation — including the @entity11 , the @entity106 , and the laws that created @entity108 — reflect a staunchly liberal agenda @entity1 himself has attempted to emulate			1
" what president @entity4 understood was that equality required more than the absence of oppression			0
it required the presence of economic opportunity , " @entity1 said , co-opting a phrase he 's taken as a rallying cry during his second term			1
those too were civil rights worth fighting for			0
" in the last year , @entity1 has begun speaking more often about race , though the topic is by no means a frequent part of his speeches and remarks			1
he addressed the issue in deeply personal terms following a jury 's acquittal of the man accused of killing black teenager @entity134 , and earlier this year the president spoke about the challenges that young men of color face in today 's society			2
many suspect @entity1 will use his post-presidential years to focus on the issue			0
while race is n't a common theme for @entity1 , combating inequality has become the central tenant of his second term agenda , through his push to close the gap between rich and poor and his efforts in closing the wage gap between men and women			1
he also makes regular references to ending discrimination against gays and lesbians , and has come out in support of same - sex marriage			0
facing a @entity161 - controlled @entity160 , his legislative efforts on those issues have thus far come up short -- leading to some negative comparisons between @entity1 and @entity4 , the so - called " master of the @entity95			1
" those comparisons ignore @entity4 's later tenure , @entity1 claimed last year in an interview with @entity167			1
" when he lost that historic majority , and the glow of that landslide victory faded , he had the same problems with @entity174 that most presidents at one point or another have , " @entity1 told the magazine 's editor , @entity168			1
" i say that not to suggest that i 'm a master wheeler - dealer but , rather , to suggest that there are some structural institutional realities to our political system that do n't have much to do with schmoozing			0
" that historical reflection was absent in thursday 's speech , though @entity1 did contend the debate in which @entity4 was embroiled still raged			1
" today we remain locked in this same great debate about equality and opportunity , and the role of government in ensuring each , " he said , declaring the government , and the presidency , were meant to try and affect change in peoples ' lives			0
@entity1 said in remarks at the @entity65 that @entity4 possessed a unique grasp of the power of government to bring about change , and used his office and his enormous legislative skills to get what he wanted			1
@entity1 said @entity4 " fought for " and " bullied " and " persuaded " until the @entity11 was signed into law			1
" and he did n't stop there , " he said , using the legislation as a springboard for other sweeping changes			0
many doubt 1964 @entity11 could pass today has the @entity213 court placed landmark 1964 civil rights law on a hit list ? column : lessons from my father , @entity4			0

@entity1 honors the @entity11 , a measure that helped pave his way to the @entity8 .
he was joined by 3 other living presidents to commemorate the act and @entity26
over the past year or so , @entity1 has begun to speak out more on race ; inequality
@entity1 's legislative efforts on those issues have come up short in @entity161 - controlled @entity8
