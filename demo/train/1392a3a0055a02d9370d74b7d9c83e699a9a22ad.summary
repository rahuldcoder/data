at approximately 3,350 meters , it 's @entity1 's highest and most active volcano			1
living up to its volatile reputation , @entity2 blew its top again over the weekend			1
@entity2 eruptions are relatively frequent -- the past 12 months have seen a string of powerful lava fountains , flows and ash emissions			2
the result : a landscape that constantly changes as lava hardens , craters collapse and , in some cases , are created			0
a trip to the top section of @entity2 is a bizarre experience -- from near the stunning peak it 's easy to understand why the volcano is one of @entity23 's most popular tourist destinations			1
more : 10 things to know before visiting @entity23 it 's tricky to line up a visit when the volcano is spewing fury like an angry goddess ( @entity29 , or @entity30 , was the @entity32 goddess of the volcano ) , so most @entity2 tourists end up with the saner , sober version			1
the images in the gallery above are from one such lava-less visit			0
yet even on calm days , the @entity2 landscape is otherworldly -- it only takes a bit of imagination to picture @entity41 stumbling about with his tricorder looking for life			2
bleak yet stunning with black lava sand , volcanic gravel and rocks that crunch underfoot , the volcano is a world apart from the classic beaches and hilltop @entity51 towns that dot @entity23			0
for hikers who start from the amenity - packed base at 1,800 meters , the scenery varies little			0
the walk up can be monotonous			0
another way up is via a cable car from the base that connects with a 4x4 bus to take visitors to the 2,800 - meter mark			1
a guide meets each vehicle and leads a walk around the area -- this is a good way to see some of @entity2 's numerous craters			1
total trip time : up and down in two hours , including lots of photo opportunities			0
for most visitors , it 's the easier , more efficient way to see the volcano			2
you can get closer to other parts of the volcano by signing on with one of many authorized @entity2 expedition tour outfits			1
cable car , 4x4 and compulsory guide fees cost about € 57.50 ( $ 80 ) per adult			1
cable car only is € 27.50			1
at almost three kilometers above sea level it is n't always exactly gelato weather on the mountain			0
layered clothing is a smart idea			0
the volcano turns into a no - frills ski resort that operates december to february , depending on snowfall			0
getting to @entity2 in peak summer months , @entity2 traffic gets busy			1
the easiest way to get the mountain is via public bus from @entity94 or other nearby towns			2
in less hectic periods , driving is ideal			0
the windy road on the south part of the peak that crisscrosses old lava flows is a nice teaser for the scenery to come			0
@entity105 driving directions can be found on the @entity2 administrative headquarters website			2
maps , expedition operators and more details can also be found at the @entity2 administrative headquarters			0
@entity2 is open daily , all year ( when not erupting in a life - threatening way ) , 9 a.m. -5:30 p.m. ( last cable car ) ; in winter to 3:30 p.m.			1

@entity2 is open to tourists every day of the year unless *authorities* deem it too dangerous
an *ascent* that includes a cable car , 4x4 bus and guided walk is the easiest way to *explore* the volcano
the volcano 's peak is actually a series of craters , some more active than others
