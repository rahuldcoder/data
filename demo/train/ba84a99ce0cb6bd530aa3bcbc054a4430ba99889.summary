@entity1 , @entity0 -- the apocalyptic tales of nature 's impending demise are as well worn as they are numerous			2
dr. @entity6 has pioneered new energy sources , including using cow waste to create cooking gas			1
but while our leaders wrangle over quotas for greenhouse emissions over banquets at lavish summits , there are remarkable individuals who are doing their small bit to prevent our planet from peril			1
take @entity22 civil engineer , dr @entity6 for instance			1
he firmly believes that the world 's future fuel demands can be met through renewable energy			2
and he is using increasingly innovative methods to achieve these results			2
three years ago @entity6 won plaudits for his " cows to @entity31 " project , which used effluents and waste products from abattoirs to produce cooking gas			1
the project was a winner of the prestigious 2005 @entity38			2
it is still going strong and being used to provide cooking fuel for nearly 6000 homes in @entity42 , southern @entity22			0
@entity6 tells @entity2 there are now plans to roll it out across most of @entity45 , including @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
this time he 's back with another groundbreaking idea to use waste from the cassava plant , a staple food of @entity22 , to generate electricity			1
his project " @entity55 : off - grid lighting from @entity59 in @entity22 , " was awarded a $ 250,000 grant in may from the @entity57 after being named one of the best projects in @entity45			0
according to @entity6 , @entity22 produces over 20 percent of the world 's output of cassava , it is a $ 5 billion industry and provides the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food			1
however , waste from cassava refining is a major public health problem in @entity22 , causing water pollution and emitting noxious greenhouse gases			1
through innovative biogas technology , zero emission bioreactors at specially constructed plants treat the cassava waste and produce biogas which drives microturbines for low cost , safe and reliable off - grid efficient lighting to thousands of rural homes			1
using this method , @entity6 says he hopes to generate 200kw daily , which will provide basic electricity for more than 2000 households initially			1
he told @entity2 : " there will be four lighting points in their homes			0
we 're thinking in terms of basic lighting , they will be able to use their tv , cassette player , that sort of thing , but it will not be able to power a refrigerator			0
" these people currently rely on kerosene lamps that are very bad for emissions and pollution			0
we also plan to provide them with low wattage lamps that use just 5kw to bring down usage			0
" through his not - for - profit organization -- @entity110 ) -- @entity6 has achieved the impressive feat of galvanizing the notoriously bureaucratic @entity22 government into action			1
he told @entity2 that the governor of @entity115 , in northern @entity22 has donated a plot of land for the launch of the project , scheduled to start next month			0
the scheme will cost $ 310,000 and will become profitable in little over three years , @entity6 says			1
" this can never replace fossil fuels because of the huge demand we have for them , but we can help to reduce greenhouse emissions by creating alternative sources of energy , " he said			1
the @entity129 in the furthest reaches of northern @entity132 , glaciers once stretched far down the mountains , now they are all but gone as global warming takes its devastating toll			2
hardworking but impoverished farmers in the @entity138 region have watched as their sole source of fresh water slowly melts away			0
but one man is taking matters into his own hands			0
@entity144 , a softly - spoken but sprightly 72 - year - old has created artificial glaciers and managed to generate water and greenery in this barren landscape			1
perched high up in the remote cold deserts of the @entity152 , @entity150 has mastered the art of harvesting water by using just a few hundred meters of iron pipes and stone embankments			1
" fifty to sixty years ago , we used to have huge glaciers here , the retired civil engineer , told @entity2			2
" they have been reduced now because of global warming and now they are on high peaks			0
" the idea of the ' artificial glacier ' was born after he noticed that taps were left running in winter to stop the water from freezing in the pipes			2
the water then flowed into the drains surrounding the taps and froze			0
" and it then occurred to me : ' why not try and make artificial glaciers in the winter ? ' so that local farmers get a real headstart when they need it most , " @entity150 says			1
the result was a device which traps the waters which melt down the high mountains by turning them into chunks of ice			0
the largest artificial glacier @entity150 has built so far is near the village of @entity185			1
about 1,000 feet ( 300 meters ) long , 150 feet ( 45 meters ) wide , and four feet ( 1 meter ) deep , it supplies irrigation water to the entire village of around 700 people			0
for @entity150 , there are several advantages of an artificial glacier over a natural one			1
firstly , it is closer to the village and at a comparatively lower altitude			0
natural glaciers , on the other hand , are located way up in the mountains and they melt slowly in summer , releasing water to the villages quite late			2
now engineers from other mountainous regions in @entity132 and @entity204 have visited to learn his methods			0
one artificial glacier costs just $ 7,000 , compared to $ 34,000 for a dam			2
only local materials are needed , and the villagers themselves can build and maintain them			0
for his efforts , @entity150 has been awarded the @entity214 's 1999 @entity213 , twelve years after he created the first one			1
however , he is frustrated at the lack of investment and funding to help modernize the design			0
" the funding is not sufficient , " he said			0
" we are getting very little amounts and we need a lot more			0
i hope to get more as this year i want to make two or three more glaciers , with a new design to improve the efficiency			2
" in 1996 , one year after he had retired , @entity150 joined the @entity227 , a non-governmental organization , as project manager for watershed development			1
" watershed development is the only solution for @entity138 's rural economy			0
otherwise , you will have rural folk flocking the city in search of jobs			0
and there are not many to go around , " he says			0
