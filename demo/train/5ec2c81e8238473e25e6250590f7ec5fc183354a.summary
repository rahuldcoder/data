something tells us @entity2 would laugh about this			2
on friday , the famed comedian , who died september 4 at age 81 , appeared to post to her @entity7 account , praising the new @entity8 6 and announcing her plans to buy one			1
" this badass is being replaced by an @entity8 6 ( not the fat one ) , " someone wrote , in @entity15 ' trademark irreverent style , in a post that accompanied a photo of an @entity18 friday morning			1
rivers died five days before the @entity8 and @entity20 ( " the fat one " ) were introduced			2
6 must - have apps for the @entity8 6 it 's not unusual for publicists or other representatives of celebrities to post for them on social media			1
the may have been written earlier and scheduled for release friday , the day the new iphones hit stores			0
whoever wrote the post had a little more trouble than just posting as a dead woman about a product she was highly unlikely to have ever seen			0
in it , " @entity15 " writes : " i got this one in 2010 , and after 4 years , my only complaint is that apps are now designed for bigger screens , and the battery is getting tired			0
" the @entity18 was released in 2011			0
as is usually the case in the internet age , deleting the post did nothing to keep it from being screen - captured and shared widely on social media , where people had some fun with @entity15 , who in later years joked frequently about her own death			0
" @entity8 is so big , @entity2 came back from the dead to endorse it , " one @entity51 user wrote			2
" @entity2 talking about the @entity8 6 ... maybe @entity53 is more than we think , " wrote another .			1
