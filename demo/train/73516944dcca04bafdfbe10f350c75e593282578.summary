" @entity23 was about the right to choose , " @entity17 told @entity0 prior to the order being signed			2
" this young woman has the right to choose to have her child			0
" legal experts said that no one can force anyone , minor or not , to undergo an abortion			2

" the lawyers were first contacted by the boy 's mother , who said that the girl 's parents were threatening both teens , according to @entity17 , who said the center then contacted the girl and offered their services gratis			1
the lawsuit alleged that the girl 's mother threatened to " slip ( the teen ) an abortion pill , " took her daughter 's phone and car and kept her home from school to punish her for choosing not to abort her fetus			1

" there 's an understanding that we will not make law on the back of a 16 - year - old girl , and that 's what her attorneys are doing , " said @entity137			1
" i 'm appalled that they 've done this to this girl			0
putting the girl 's parents ' names in court documents ... her attorneys have done a lousy job protecting her confidentiality			1

@entity17 responded that the courts had notified child protective services about the abuse allegations			0
last year @entity17 's group represented a 14 - year - old from @entity166 who said her family wanted to force her to have an abortion			1
the girl did n't want to abort the fetus , @entity17 said , and her grandmother and cousins were allegedly abusive to the teen			2
