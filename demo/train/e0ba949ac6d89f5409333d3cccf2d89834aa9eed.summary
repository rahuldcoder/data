@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 court sentenced a @entity6 prince wednesday to the maximum penalty of life in prison for murdering his servant			1
prince @entity12 will have to serve a minimum of 20 years , a court official said			1
for now , it will be in a @entity4 jail , since @entity4 and @entity6 do not have a prisoner transfer agreement			1
the prince was found guilty tuesday of both murder and grievous bodily harm in the february killing of @entity21 in a case prosecutors said had a sexual element			1
@entity21 died after a severe beating left him with swelling and bruising of the brain and fractured ribs and neck			2
he also had bite marks on his face , ears and arm			0
the prince had not denied killing @entity21 , but said he had not intended to do so			1
he did not take the stand in his own defense			0
because the prince did not deny killing @entity21 , the jury 's job was to determine if he was guilty of murder or manslaughter			1
to do that , jurors had to determine the prince 's state of mind and his intent at the time he killed @entity21			2
they took just over an hour and a half to reach a verdict			0
police said after tuesday 's verdict that the prince had shown no remorse when he was questioned about his servant 's death , instead " concocting a story " about how he died			2
" when that was found to be a pack of lies , he tried to claim diplomatic immunity , " but did not qualify for it , @entity61 of @entity0 's @entity49 told journalists outside the court tuesday			2
prosecutors said the prince 's systematic mistreatment of the victim had a sexual element			0
the bites suffered by @entity21 were not a factor in his death , but had " an obvious sexual connotation , " prosecutor @entity69 said in his opening statement two weeks ago			0
the two men were in @entity0 earlier this year as @entity12 took in @entity76 , the @entity77 and other @entity79 cities on a long global holiday with @entity21 as his companion			1
@entity12 's lawyer , @entity82 , said in his closing argument monday that @entity12 " must live with the consequences " of having killed @entity21 , but he never intended to harm him			1
he also disputed suggestions from the prosecutor and several witnesses that the prince and his aide had a gay relationship			0
during their visit to @entity0 , the two men shared a hotel room , went shopping together and stayed out late in bars and nightclubs			0
@entity2 's @entity96 contributed to this report .			0
