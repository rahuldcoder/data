-- a fierce weather system -- featuring baseball - sized hail and multiple tornadoes -- ripped through @entity5 on wednesday afternoon , spurring warnings to people in and around @entity8 to take cover			1
the frenzy was tied to a dangerous super cell thunderstorm that , in addition to heaps of hail , produced a number of twisters , according to storm chasers on the scene			2
the @entity19 said there were reported tornado touchdowns in @entity22 , @entity8 , @entity23 , @entity24 and leader			1
one witness , @entity26 , said shortly after 3 p.m. ( 5 p.m. et ) that he had personally seen five tornadoes on the ground not far from @entity29			0
" this thing is spinning up multiple tornadoes , " @entity26 told @entity0 's @entity30			1
" there were tornadoes on the outer ring of the circulation , ... and then there 's the main tornado vortex closer to the storm			2
" one of those got within about a mile of the @entity8 airport , only to move past it , according to @entity26			1
the airport was n't struck directly , though it was certainly affected			0
six planes in @entity8 - based @entity45 ' fleet had to be taken out of service due to hail damage , company spokeswoman @entity42 said			1
and the airport 's @entity49 feed reported 38 flights were diverted and average delays of 90 minutes , not to mention the ordeal of removing hail and water from the airfield			2
ireporter : ' this is the first time i 've seen anything like this ' while those delays subsided , by later wednesday night travelers were dealing with a different problem : sections of @entity66 and nearby streets were closed due to flooding , according to a @entity70 press release			0
likewise , the city of @entity8 and neighboring municipalities appear to have escaped without significant damage			0
the heart of the system then moved into more rural areas			0
even if these areas escape without severe wind damage , the hail -- some as big as baseballs , according to storm chaser @entity80 -- made an impact in more ways than one			1
the weather service 's @entity85 branch retweeted a photo of about 6 inches of accumulated hail in @entity8 's @entity89 , plus another showing @entity90 restricted to one lane because of the hard , white stuff			2
for most of the evening , much of northern @entity5 -- as well as several counties in @entity95 -- were under tornado watches			0
the storms continued to produce heavy rain and relatively small hail that contributed to minor street flooding in places like @entity85 , @entity103 and @entity104 , according to the @entity19 .			0
