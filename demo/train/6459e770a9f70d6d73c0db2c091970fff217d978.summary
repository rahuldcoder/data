@entity0 -- @entity3 gov. @entity2 will deliver the @entity5 response to president @entity6 's final @entity7 - a marquee assignment for a woman who leads a state with fewer than 2 million voters			1
@entity3 gov. @entity2 speaks at a news conference in june 2007 in @entity0			2
@entity2 became the 44th governor of the state of @entity3 in 2003			1
she made her first run for governor on a pledge to make the state more business - friendly and increase government efficiency			2
the @entity3 governor has a political pedigree : her father , @entity23 , was a @entity5 governor of @entity24 in the ' 70s			2
but the governor has paid her political dues , with stints as a @entity3 state representative and state insurance commissioner			0
since she moved into the governor 's mansion , @entity30 has identified @entity2 as " one to watch			1
" @entity33 named her one of four " rising stars from the heartland , " and short - listed her as one of the nation 's five best governors			1
" @entity46 my words , @entity2 will be on everyone 's @entity48 short list in 2008 , " @entity5 blogger @entity40 said on his @entity42 web site , as he applauded her 2006 success in wooing disaffected @entity3 republicans			1
most of the national political figures to come out of @entity3 have been republicans , like president @entity52 and former sen. @entity53			0
but entering her sixth year as governor , @entity2 seems to be everyone 's favorite pick to join that select group			1
the down - to - earth governor has certified red state appeal with a blue state edge : she loves @entity61 and college sports , running and the @entity63			2
and the 58 - year - old has an offbeat sense of humor			0
( sometimes , perhaps , a bit too offbeat for some voters -- like the time she said during an election - year debate that @entity73 roads scared her more than the @entity75 attacks			0
) but the big draw for national @entity5 is her skill at appealing to moderate @entity44 voters -- the only way a @entity81 can win major office in @entity3			1
@entity2 has won two gubernatorial elections in a state with roughly twice as many registered @entity44 as @entity5			1
@entity6 carried the state by at least 20 points in each of his presidential runs and no @entity5 presidential contender has won there since @entity89 in 1964			1
when @entity2 was elected governor , @entity3 faced a judicial order to increase school spending in the midst of its worst budget crisis since the 1930s			0
under @entity2 ' leadership , the @entity3 economy has rebounded , resulting in low unemployment and the creation of thousands of jobs , according to a @entity3 government web site			0
her first term was considered so successful that during her re-election run , a few @entity44 tried to use it against her -- predicting she 'd probably be tapped for a @entity108 run before she finished a second term			0
so far , @entity2 has downplayed the scenario			0
but she has begun to have an impact beyond the @entity112			0
during her first term , she visited @entity114 troops in @entity115			0
last year , she took on a high - profile national assignment , serving as chairwoman of the @entity118			0
if sen. @entity120 fails to capture the presidential nomination this year , many democrats say @entity2 will remain high on any vice presidential short list			1
democrats close to the campaign of sen. @entity125 told @entity126 will announce after tonight 's @entity7 speech that she 's endorsing @entity125			2

@entity2 to deliver the @entity5 response to @entity7
@entity133 short - listed her as one of the nation 's five best governors
@entity2 governs state with twice as many registered @entity44 as @entity5
