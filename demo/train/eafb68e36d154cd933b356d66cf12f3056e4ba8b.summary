@entity0 -- the commander for @entity4 forces in @entity5 said wednesday that more military presence is " needed as quickly as possible			1
" @entity9 troops are seeing an increased threat in @entity5 , gen. @entity7 says			1
gen. @entity7 said the additional military capability is needed because of " an increased number of fighters " coming into @entity5 from @entity15 's lawless tribal regions			1
" it 's a significant increase from what we saw this time last year , " he said at the @entity16			0
" we 're facing a tougher threat right now , especially in the east where we have the @entity9 division , " he said			1
" and so the additional military capability [ is ] needed as quickly as possible			0
" he said what 's necessary includes " boots on the ground " as well as support such as " helicopters , increased intelligence assets , logistics , transportation and so on			0
" just over a week ago , defense secretary @entity32 said that a @entity34 battalion will head to @entity5 in november and an @entity36 brigade in january , but no more forces will be available for deployment to @entity5 until spring or summer of 2009			2
the week before @entity32 ' announcement , @entity7 had asked for four more brigades -- three more than the one approved to go in january			2
three brigades add up to as many as 12,000 troops			0
the defense secretary , speaking before the @entity44 last month , expressed caution about adding too many troops in @entity5			2
" i think we need to think about how heavy a military footprint the @entity9 ought to have in @entity5 , " he told the committee			2
instead , @entity32 said , there should be a focus on increasing the size of the @entity5 army			0
@entity7 , who took command of @entity4 's @entity55 earlier this year , said his request of an additional 3,500 people to train the @entity5 army and police is still under review			1
@entity7 noted that he is " cautiously optimistic " regarding @entity15 's military operations against @entity62 and @entity64 fighters inside its borders			1
" what we 're seeing is @entity15 leadership taking on a deteriorated militant sanctuary in the tribal areas that has deteriorated over last several years , " he said			0
@entity7 said it is " probably too early " to see if @entity15 's military clampdown in its tribal areas has had any effect on stemming militant activity in @entity5			1
" we 're watching those very closely to see if there 's a cause and effect with the strength of the insurgency on the @entity5 side of the border , " he said			0
" but we think that 's a positive step that they are taking on those militant sanctuaries			0

more foreign fighters entering @entity5 from @entity15 , general says
" we 're facing a tougher threat , " so more troops needed " as quickly as possible "
