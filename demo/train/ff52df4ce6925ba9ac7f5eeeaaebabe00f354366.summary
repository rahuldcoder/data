-- three - time champions @entity1 marched into the semifinals of the @entity4 after destroying @entity7 's highly - rated @entity6 side 4 - 0 on saturday in a rematch of the 1986 and 1990 title matches			1
veteran striker @entity10 celebrated his 100th international appearance with two goals in @entity13 , taking him level second in the tournament 's all - time scoring list alongside compatriot @entity17 on 14			1
@entity18 , one of the finds of the month - long football showpiece , headed the opening goal inside the third minute , his fourth of the @entity24 tournament , while @entity25 bundled home his first in 76 internationals to make it 3 - 0			1
@entity7 told reporters after the match that he was unsure about his future with @entity6 , who also lost to @entity1 at the same stage in a penalty shootout in 2006			1
" we will see what happens			0
i have n't thought about leaving			0
i have to check that with my family and the players , and there are things i have to consider , " he said			0
" but as coach and player , the type of football people like is this one			0
touch the ball , rotate , run -- @entity6 ca n't play a different style			2
" @entity49 - studded @entity6 team rarely looked like breaking down the well - organized @entity51 line - up , and when they did put the ball in the net in the 36th minute @entity54 was clearly offside			1
@entity6 's world player of the year @entity55 now goes home without having scored a goal at the event , having come into it with huge expectations surrounding him			2
@entity1 will next face @entity61 champions @entity62 , who beat @entity64 1 - 0 in saturday 's final last - eight tie			1
@entity17 will miss that match due to suspension after picking up his second booking			0
" the fact that we wo n't have him is a serious blow because he has shown how dangerous he is , " @entity1 coach @entity69 later told reporters in quotes carried by @entity72			2
" i saw his yellow and do n't see why he got it			0
the ball touches his thigh then his arm from a short distance			0
i really question the yellow			0
" but in the past we have been able to replace people like @entity17 and we will continue to do so as we move forward			0
" the 20 - year - old , who has played only seven international matches , glanced in an early header from @entity90 's teasing cross which @entity6 goalkeeper @entity91 could only deflect into the net with his right leg			2
@entity17 then presented @entity10 with a glorious chance to make it 2 - 0 , but the 32 - year - old blazed his shot over the bar			1
the @entity98 thought they had equalized when @entity99 fed the ball to @entity54 , but at least four @entity101 were in offside positions in the build - up play			0
@entity10 , who spent most of last season on the substitutes ' bench at @entity51 champions @entity107 while @entity17 grabbed the headlines , made it 2 - 0 from close range in the 68th minute after being set up by @entity111			1
the 31 - year - old @entity25 killed off @entity6 with 16 minutes to play after @entity90 waltzed past three defenders and laid on a perfect pass for his teammate			1
coach @entity7 -- who led @entity6 to victory as captain against the @entity51 in @entity117 in 1986 but suffered defeat in @entity119 four years after that -- took off right - back @entity121 , who struggled to fill what has been a problem position for the team throughout the tournament			2
he also brought on striker @entity127 , but @entity1 continued the clinical counter-attacking display that so ruthlessly ended @entity130 's hopes in the previous round as @entity10 moved to within a goal of @entity134 star @entity133 on the all - time list with an 89th - minute volley from @entity138 's cross .			1

@entity10 scores twice as @entity1 thrash @entity6 4 - 0 in @entity13
@entity18 heads opening goal of @entity4 *quarterfinal* in the third minute
@entity25 nets his first for @entity1 in rematch of 1986 and @entity147 finals
@entity1 will next play @entity61 champions @entity62 in *wednesday* 's second semifinal
