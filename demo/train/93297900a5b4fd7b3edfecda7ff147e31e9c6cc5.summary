-- @entity1 will resume killer whale shows while the company and two federal agencies investigate the death of a whale trainer at @entity7 , company and federal officials announced friday			1
the shows , which were suspended at all @entity1 locations after the death wednesday at @entity7 , will resume saturday with new precautionary measures in place , said @entity15 , president of @entity16			1
earlier friday , the @entity18 's @entity17 and the @entity20 's @entity19 announced they were looking into the death of @entity22 , 40			1
@entity22 was pulled underwater when a killer whale named @entity24 grabbed her ponytail			1
a source at @entity1 said that after seizing her , the whale dove deep underwater			1
trainers eventually had to wrangle the animal into a smaller pool before they could retrieve her body about 40 minutes later			1
@entity33 : watch tourist 's video just before attack a former head of animal training said friday that @entity22 left herself vulnerable to attack and that she may have broken the park 's training protocol			1
" @entity47 , if she was standing here right now , would tell you that that was her mistake in allowing that to happen , " said former @entity1 trainer @entity42 , who had worked with @entity22 in the past , on @entity44 's " @entity43			1
" @entity42 called @entity22 " one the best killer whale trainers i ever worked with			1
" still , he said , @entity22 should not have been lying in a slideout -- a platform covered by roughly 4 inches of water -- so close to a killer whale			1
" when i was there we did have a protocol that you would not do that , you would not lie down in a slideout and get that close to his mouth			0
" now , whether she broke that protocol or not i do n't know , or if the protocol changed in how they were working with him , " @entity42 continued			2
" but i 'm pretty sure it was her breaking the protocol			0
" @entity15 said friday that it 's too soon to tell if @entity22 violated protocol			1
" it 's far too early to get to that point , " the @entity1 president said			2
" we 're really still trying to collect information , trying to understand the nature and scope of the event			0
" he declined to discuss @entity1 's training protocols , saying they are " proprietary documents			2
" @entity15 had high praise for @entity22 and said a charitable foundation is being formed to support causes she was interested in			1
he told reporters that video images in connection with the accident have been made available to the appropriate authorities			0
@entity15 said @entity24 " is a wonderful animal " and " will remain an active and contributing member of the team despite what happened			0
" " he 's a very special animal that requires special handling			2
obviously the procedures that we 've had in place are something we 're revisiting at this point , " he said			0
@entity24 's size and weight -- 12,000 pounds , compared with 6,000 to 9,000 pounds for the facility 's other killer whales -- was one reason there were separate procedures in place for him at the @entity7 facility			1
when the shows with killer whales resume saturday at @entity7 and other @entity1 parks , trainers wo n't get into the water with the animals			1
" direct interactions " with the animals were suspended in all three @entity1 parks after the death			2
various other improvements and changes will be enacted , @entity15 said			0
@entity124 : photo taken moments before attack @entity18 spokesman @entity128 said the safety and health agency is looking into whether @entity17 workplace standards were violated in the incident			1
it will complete a report within six months , he said			0
if workplace infractions are found , @entity17 will propose financial penalties , @entity128 said			1
if that happens , the company could accept the penalties and make any necessary workplace changes or appeal proposed penalties before an @entity17 review commission			1
@entity143 , @entity20 spokesman , said inspectors are looking into the incident from the animal welfare perspective			0
the @entity19 wants to know if there were any violations of the @entity149 , a federal set of minimum - care standards for entities that get @entity20 licenses , including facilities that exhibit warm - blooded mammals to the public			2
@entity143 said the incident will trigger a " focused " investigation , in which inspectors will go to @entity1 to gather facts			0
if they think any welfare - act violations contributed to the incident , a formal investigation will begin			0
such violations could trigger fines and even license suspensions and revocations			0
" if we feel animals are suffering , we can confiscate the animal , " @entity143 said			0
he said @entity7 has never been the object of a penalty enforcement			0
in a video posted on @entity1 's blog , @entity176 , head of animal training for @entity16 , mourned @entity22 's death and raised the issue of safety standards			1
" we need to evaluate our safety procedures and how we interact with these animals , " he said , and he stressed that it 's " extremely important that we continue to take care of these animals the best way possible			2
" the same whale was linked previously to two other deaths			2
@entity24 and two other whales were involved in the drowning of a trainer at a @entity194 , @entity195 , marine park in 1991			2
the trainer fell into the whale tank at @entity197 and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched			1
in 1999 , @entity24 was blamed for the death of a 27 - year - old man whose body was found floating in a tank at @entity1 , the apparent victim of a whale 's " horseplay , " authorities said then			1
the @entity207 said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed , then climbed into the tank			0
@entity209 , a marine biologist who has studied whales for 20 years , said @entity24 could have been trying to play with @entity22 or get her attention or companionship			1
such whales play with seals and sea lions in the wild , tossing them in the air , she said , but end up letting them go			2
but she said the whale could also have been frustrated for some reason			2
the incident raises larger questions about the captivity of wild animals			0
@entity226 said dolphins and other sea animals in aquariums " routinely die prematurely of stress and other captivity - related causes , " and human casualties also occur			0
the incident occurred about 2 p.m. wednesday			0
@entity176 said the whale had just finished a session with @entity22 , who was leaning over and rubbing his head			1
they were in knee - deep water , he said			0
" she had a long ponytail that brushed in front of her and apparently got in front of his nose , " @entity176 said			0
" he probably felt it			0
" @entity24 grabbed the ponytail and pulled @entity22 into the water , he said			1
rescuers were not immediately able to reach her because the whale was too aggressive , the sheriff 's office said			2
she was recovered by @entity1 staff members after @entity24 was coaxed into a smaller pool and lifted out of the water by a large platform on the bottom of the smaller tank , authorities said			0
@entity124 : @entity22 performing at @entity1 in june 2009 @entity22 had wanted to be an animal trainer from the time she visited @entity1 as a 9 - year - old , her sister @entity262 said			1
" it was her dream job , " @entity262 said			0
" she loved the animals like they were her own children			0
... she loved what she did			0
