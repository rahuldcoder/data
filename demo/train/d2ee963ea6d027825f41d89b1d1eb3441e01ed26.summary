@entity0 -- @entity2 may look like an average student in @entity0 with her standard - issue blue shift dress with a @entity6 collar and sensible black shoes			1
but her ordinary appearance and shy manner mask a steely determination to triumph over tremendous odds			2
she recently scored within the top 5 % for nearly all her subjects in the city 's college entrance examination -- despite being blind and severely hearing - impaired from a young age			1
she also lacks sensitivity in her fingertips , which denies her the ability to feel the raised dots of @entity21 characters			1
rather than admit defeat , the 20 year old found an alternative way to read @entity21 -- with her lips			1
" in @entity32 1 ( the equivalent of grade 1 in the @entity35 ) , i noticed that she was always leaning forward , " said @entity27 - @entity26 , a teacher at the @entity28 for the @entity29 -- the only special needs school in @entity0 dedicated to the blind			1
" she told me it was because she could read more clearly with her lips than her hands			1
" @entity41 herself admitted : " i know it 's not a common approach and it sounds rather strange			1
even i myself do n't know how it came about , " she added , calling it " miraculous			2
" in actual fact , the lips , tongue , and fingertips are particularly adept at spatial discrimination â € ” they can perceive two points that are only 1 - 3 millimeters apart , according to the classic anatomy text , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
in comparison , the legs or back of the hands can only detect two points with a separation of more than 50 - 100 millimeters			2
while @entity41 may not be the very first person to resort to lip - reading @entity21 , she appears to be a rare case			1
" this is the first i have heard of someone being successful using the lips , " said @entity65 , a professor at @entity66 who specializes in education for the visually impaired			1
@entity71 also said that @entity41 was the only student at @entity72 to have used their lips -- and is the sole case she is aware of in @entity0			1
lip - reading braille is not without its challenges , however			2
" nobody could accept it in the beginning , " @entity41 said			0
" even now , many people find it odd ... it 's caused some embarrassment when i read in public places and in front of people that i do n't have a close relationship with			1
" it also poses practical problems , as @entity21 books are typically large and heavy			1
nonetheless , @entity41 said she is " grateful " to still have a way to learn about the world through the written word			0
@entity98 is one of her favorite past times -- a source of intellectual stimulation and psychological refuge			0
she also believes she can transcend her disabilities through hard work , determination , and the willingness to push herself outside of her comfort zone			0
" without the courage to challenge myself , there is surely no possibility of success , " she said			0
at @entity72 , her classes were comprised of only ten students , whose shared disability enabled them to easily build close friendships			0
all materials were prepared in @entity21 and teachers were specially trained to work with the blind			1
but in form 1 ( the equivalent of grade 7 in the @entity35 ) , @entity41 decided to leave the comfort of @entity128 and move to a regular secondary school , wanting to immerse herself in a more authentic , mainstream environment			0
" i have to facilitate my adaptation to society when i finish my studies and have to enter the workplace , " she said			0
her transition to the city 's @entity138 was not always easy			1
classes were much larger and teachers did not have specialized training to work with blind students			1
@entity41 had to send all printed materials to @entity128 or the @entity145 for the @entity146 for transcription into @entity21			1
@entity98 and writing took her twice the amount of time it did for her peers , she said			0
she learned she had to be more independent and make a greater effort to express her feelings and needs with staff and students , who were welcoming but unaccustomed to dealing with a blind person			1
one of her teachers , @entity160 , said that staff learned over time when to intervene to help her			2
" if she needs something , she will let us know , " @entity160 said , adding that her fiercely independent student walked around the school campus unassisted , eschewing a walking stick and elevators and taking the stairs by herself			2
@entity160 , who clearly holds deep affection for her student , said that while @entity41 was never bullied , social integration has been a gradual process			2
" she has friends , but she 's not part of some big group			2
for example , a gaggle of girls may be chatting about pop culture , but it can be difficult for her to enter the conversation			0
she may not recognize who is speaking in overlapping conversations and she lacks familiarity with pop culture			0
" attending class with the same cohort of students over the past three years has helped a lot , @entity160 said , and students have learned to make an effort to include @entity41 in conversations			2
@entity41 said that she has made close friends			0
" i am grateful for their acceptance of me as a normal member of their social circle and throughout these years , they have given me a great deal of support and encouragement			0
" while her academic feats -- she scored 5 * * , the highest possible grade , for @entity6 , @entity204 , and liberal studies , 5 * for @entity206 and @entity207 and 4 for math â € ” have won her much acclaim in @entity0 , @entity41 admits that she surprised herself			1
" i was really astonished and excited when i heard that my results in some of the subjects were far from my expectations , " she said			0
" i felt my hard work this year has finally paid off			0
" she hopes to study translation at university starting this fall to have a " balanced development in both @entity6 and @entity204			0
" " whenever i come across some thought - provoking and touching books , i really wish i could translate them into different languages so as to share them with more readers , " she added			0
as she embarks on the new phase of her hard - won education , @entity41 maintains matter - of - fact and philosophical			0
" the inconveniences and limitations ( my impairments ) bring will follow me my whole life ... and i must have the courage to face the facts ... i 'm going to treasure what i still have			0
" " i would like to encourage everyone to have the courage and perseverance to go through all the ups and downs in our lives because i know everyone has their own difficulties			0
but one thing is for sure : where there 's a will , there 's a way			2
