-- @entity0 will soon be ubiquitous in @entity3 cockpits , but do n't expect pilots to be playing " @entity7 " instead of paying attention to the flight path			1
@entity3 is striving to go all - digital by the end of 2012 , replacing pilots ' bulky 35 - pound bags full of navigational charts , log books and other flight reference materials with the 1.5 - pound @entity15 tablets			1
it 's a move that the airline says will save at least $ 1.2 million a year , based on current fuel prices			1
" that 's even on the low end , " said capt. @entity19 , an active @entity3 pilot and spokesman for the company			1
" really , we know what each aircraft burns in terms of weight per hour , so for every pound , you can measure the fuel burn			2
" ipads are n't new on the scene			0
the @entity34 approved the use of the tablets in 2011 , but @entity37 is the first commercial carrier to receive the agency 's approval to use them in the cockpit during all phases of flight from gate to gate , including during landing and takeoff			1
many airlines are using flight apps , which do n't require @entity50 once installed on the tablets			1
@entity19 says the initiative is designed to not only save @entity37 money but , since each flight bag is made up of thousands of pages that must be updated constantly , to be a valuable time - saver as well			1
" it takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour , an hour and a half , for revisions to take out the old page and put new pages in			0
that 's at least three to four times a month , " he said			0
user error in misplacing a page here or there will be eliminated , improving the navigational charts ' accuracy			2
" we 've got all of our charts into a digital format , " @entity19 said			2
" every two weeks , we get revisions			0
it pushes updates , we touch the icon , and it updates			0
" eliminating the need for the reams of paper each kitbag requires is another consideration , as well as preventing personal injuries			0
" each kitbag can weigh 35 to 45 pounds , " @entity19 said			0
" it 's a quality of life thing			0
we have a lot of pilots in these very small cockpits that are trying to gingerly place kitbags in very small ( areas )			2
we 've seen pulled muscles and injuries on duty			0
" @entity94 has been paperless since last year , distributing 11,000 @entity0 to all @entity94 and @entity97 pilots for use in the cockpit			1
it 's unclear if or how soon @entity94 will match @entity37 in getting the @entity34 's approval for @entity0 use during all phases of flight			1
@entity105 says that although it has been experimenting with moving to an electronic flight bag program , no formal decision has been made to go to tablets just yet			2
while the @entity0 is the only tablet currently approved by the @entity34 to replace current flight kits , other tablets could be authorized as well			1
" it 's a game - changer , " @entity19 said			0
" i 'm in my 23rd year ( with @entity3 )			1
if you just fly one trip with me , you could see the amazing difference all that weight , and all the monotony of doing all those revisions , can make			2
" he understands that consumers may have concerns about playing games or being distracted by other entertaining @entity0 apps			1
" we are professionals , we have rules that we follow , and our licenses and crew depend on our being professional and following the rules			0
and our pilots are good at that			0
we self - police , so we will be keeping an eye out			0

some airlines are phasing in @entity0 for pilots to replace heavy manuals and charts
@entity3 has @entity34 approval to use @entity0 during all phases of flight
the airline expects to save $ 1.2 million by cutting the weight of pilots ' flight bags
@entity94 has been paperless since last year
