-- two mothers expressed outrage friday night that their young children -- about 1,000 miles away and days apart -- were inadvertently given alcohol by servers at franchises of national chain restaurants			1
@entity8 , whose 2 - year - old son was given sangria on march 31 at an @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , told @entity15 's @entity14 that she 's having difficulty accepting what happened			1
" they poisoned my child right in front of me , " @entity8 said friday			1
" there are n't really words for how distrustful that makes me feel , how angry i am			0
" just over a week later , on april 8 , @entity23 said that her 15 - month - old son was given alcohol during a meal -- rather than the apple juice he 'd ordered -- at an @entity28 's in @entity29 , @entity30			1
she said that the staff there explained that the boy got the wrong drink due to a mix - up at the bar , after containers for apple juice and margarita mix ( which has tequila and triple sec ) were somehow switched			1
this week , @entity28 's issued a statement apologizing to the parents of @entity44 " for the stress and worry this caused them			1
" it vowed to immediately retrain servers on the company 's " beverage pouring policy " and change to pouring apple juice only from single - serve containers , like a juice box			1
" we recognize our responsibility to constantly assess our safety policies and procedures to ensure they are rigorous and consistently followed , " the @entity54 - based chain said			2
" we believe today 's strong actions make a statement to our guests of all ages around our commitment to provide a safe and enjoyable dining experience			0
" but @entity23 told @entity14 on friday that she 's not convinced			0
the mother , who is 18 and was at the restaurant with her son and fiance , said she was particularly angry given that a similar incident happened before at @entity28 's -- namely , a 2006 case in which a 5 - year - old boy was given a @entity74 iced tea , which contains rum , gin , vodka and tequila , at a @entity80 establishment of the national chain			1
" it 's just sad , the simple fact that this is n't the first time this happened ( or ) that they were going to change the way they were going to serve drinks , " the mother said			2
" why wait two , three kids later to change the way you serve drinks ? what if my son was the one that died ? " @entity98 , a personal injury attorney who represented the family involved in the 2006 case , told @entity15 that -- whatever @entity28 's and other restaurant 's promises to change their policies for serving drinks to children -- a parent should never rely on a server fully when their son or daughter gets a beverage			1
" the parent , unfortunately , can not now trust what used to be a no - brainer , " @entity98 said			0
" restaurants are serving drinks for kids , millions of drinks , but now , given this sort of rash of ... unavoidable or unacceptable mistakes , the parents now have to test the drink			2
" police were called to the @entity28 's in @entity30 after @entity23 and her fiance noticed @entity44 acting strangely -- " saying ' hi ' and ' bye ' to the walls ( and ) laid his head down like he was sleepy , then woke up and got really hyper , " recalled the mother			1
once a server told the parents that the boy was given margarita mix , he was rushed to the hospital , where @entity23 said he had a blood - alcohol limit of .10			1
@entity28 's , though , said that @entity29 police conducted a field test and found the drink itself only registered a .014 alcohol level			1
while @entity23 has already filed a lawsuit against @entity28 's , @entity8 said she has not decided whether to do the same against @entity11			1
@entity8 claims that her son , @entity141 , ordered an orange juice and started drinking it			0
but then a waiter " came over and said there 's been a mistake , grabbed the cup and kind of scurried away			0
" meanwhile , her son " was not acting like himself " -- climbing in and out of his high chair and people 's laps , not responding to requests to calm down , and " just getting louder and louder			0
" when the restaurant 's staff admitted that the boy had gotten sangria , which contains wine , the child was brought to the hospital			1
after some struggle , he was given intravenous fluids and had his blood drawn before being checked and eventually released			0
" he ended up with a lot of bruises , " @entity8 said			0
after the incident came to light , @entity11 released a statement in which it called the incident " unacceptable			2
" the chain , which is headquartered in @entity171 , @entity13 , said " we have implemented a change in our procedures to prevent this situation from happening again " -- though it did n't detail what those changes were			2
" we take the responsibility that comes with serving alcohol seriously , " the statement said			2
" as much as we strive for perfection , this was an unfortunate case of human error			0
" but @entity8 , the toddler 's mother , said she 's not yet ready to forgive			2
" just that their disorganization allowed this ever to happen -- it 's extremely frustrating , " she said			0
" i 've lost all trust and all faith in them			0
" watch issues with @entity14 monday through sunday at 7pm et on @entity15			0
