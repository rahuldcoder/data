@entity0 -- with the election just days away , most @entity2 disapprove of both @entity4 and @entity5 in @entity6 , while 58 percent of our fellow citizens say it 's time for a third party			0
so let 's break out of the two - party mold and take a look at some of the independent candidates across the country who are surging or struggling as @entity20 approaches			2
more @entity2 now identify themselves as independent than @entity21 or @entity5 -- and independent candidacies are on the rise			2
" ninety - two percent of the voters this election will find a minor party or independent candidate on their ballot , either for statewide office or for @entity32 , " said @entity24 of the @entity25			2
" that 's higher than in a normal midterm year			2
" the @entity2 had four independent governors in the 1990s -- @entity36 of @entity37 , @entity38 of @entity39 , @entity40 of @entity41 , and @entity42 of @entity43 -- but none in the last decade			2
we 've had three independents in the @entity47 since 2000 -- @entity49 's @entity48 and @entity50 as well as @entity39 's @entity51			2
and independent mayor @entity52 of @entity0 is mentioned as a possible candidate for president in 2012 , following in @entity56 's self - funded footsteps			2
this year , we have high - profile candidates running for governor 's mansions and for the @entity47 as independents			1
@entity61 is leading in polls to become the first independent governor of @entity64 -- one of 10 states where registered independents outnumber @entity4 or @entity5			1
president @entity68 recently decided not to endorse the @entity21 in this race out of deference to @entity61 , who had been a rare @entity5 friend in the @entity47 and supported @entity68 in ' 08			1
there is " fatigue with the two parties right now , " @entity61 told me a few months ago			1
" people are so weary of the gridlock and partisanship			2
it 's counterproductive to moving the country forward in our very , very challenging times			0
" in @entity43 , independent @entity82 is trending upward and collecting major newspaper endorsements for his bid to be governor , though he still trails in the polls			1
but in a state where two - term gov. @entity42 set the model for independent executives , you ca n't count out a man whose plans are praised by local newspapers as " thoughtful , logical and , most important , doable " -- especially when his @entity5 opponent is becoming best known for promising to tell the president to " get the hell out " of his state			0
two serious independent @entity47 runs are being conducted this year , both by centrist @entity5 who found themselves being pushed out by conservative @entity100 activists in closed partisan primaries			1
in @entity41 , polls show incumbent sen. @entity103 running neck and neck with @entity5 nominee @entity106 , who enjoys the support of former gov. @entity108			0
@entity103 is running as an independent in a write - in candidacy			1
the last successful write - in @entity47 candidate was @entity112 in 1954			0
but the @entity103 name is almost as influential in @entity41 , and @entity106 's erratic behavior , including allowing his private security staff to handcuff a local reporter , is provoking a backlash even among conservatives like @entity119 , who recently called him a " clown			0
" in @entity123 , gov. @entity122 has been campaigning as an independent for the @entity47			0
he was leading in polls over the summer , but @entity5 nominee @entity126 has been surging by staying competitive among @entity123 's 2.5 million independent voters , while keeping his @entity5 base happy			0
it might surprise you to know that there are 140 independent or third - party candidates running for the @entity32 this year -- and while most are admittedly long shots , their campaigns retain an aura of idealism and independence			1
for example , in @entity139 , independent candidate @entity138 , a local math teacher , explains the logic of his campaign in a radio ad which proclaims , " they say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result			1
but that 's what we 've been doing electing the same career politicians of the same political parties year after year -- 13 trillion in debt , open borders , and 8 million lost jobs is what we got			1
... i 'm no politician , but i know when things do n't add up			0
if we want to change @entity160 , we have to change who we send there			0
" one of the most interesting stories of independence this year comes from the @entity165 , a surprising reinvention of the political party to which @entity168 and @entity169 once belonged			0
" we are in the grass - roots stage , but over time , when people think @entity175 , we want them to think of non-fringe , pragmatic centrist solutions , " said @entity170 , one of the founders and leaders of the party			0
" we wanted that connection to history , " he said , " but we have modern principles -- our members tend to be socially liberal but fiscally conservative			0
" the @entity165 claims 50,000 members in all 50 states , and it is running a handful of candidates for both @entity6 and statewide office this year			1
@entity188 is the party 's candidate in @entity191 's @entity190 , running a competitive campaign against @entity5 incumbent @entity193			1
( there is no @entity21 in the race			0
) vanke -- a 40 - year - old former @entity197 with a ph.d. in history -- has a detailed balanced budget proposal as the centerpiece of his campaign and pledges to keep at least 50 percent of his net worth in federal bonds " in order to get more of @entity2 debt out of @entity207 , @entity208 , and other foreign hands and back into our own country			1
" more and more @entity2 are declaring their independence , because the two major parties seem to be controlled by special interests or the parties ' most extreme elements , leading directly to government dysfunction			1
the parties are not mentioned in the @entity219 , but they act as if they are the purpose of our politics			1
and until they become more representative and responsive to the majority of @entity2 who feel politically homeless , we will see more declarations of independents			0
the courage of their example could drive a renewal of our democracy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			1

@entity236 : most people are *unhappy* with the two major parties and want an *alternative*
he says several independents and third parties are on ballots this year
@entity236 says @entity61 is running a *credible* independent campaign in @entity64
@entity236 : the two major parties " act as if they are the purpose of our politics "
