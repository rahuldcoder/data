-- freed activist @entity1 has made a passionate plea for dialogue and reconciliation to build democracy and improve human rights in @entity7 , calling for her country to back her as she can not " do it alone			0
" but long - term fundamental political and economic reforms will not just depend on shifting internal dynamics , but also on the stance of its neighbors , particularly the regional superpowers @entity15 and @entity17			2
both countries are significant investors in @entity7 , also known as @entity7 , and both are also competing for influence in the state , with neither country taking a genuine interest in reconciliation or democracy in @entity7 , some analysts say			2
@entity28 , a research fellow on @entity7 at the @entity29 , told @entity0 : " @entity15 and @entity17 both have a serious influence on @entity7 ... both provide billions of inward investment into the country and they are dealing with a junta that is not accountable to anyone , and that serves the interests of @entity15 and @entity17 investors			1
" but according to @entity39 , of the @entity41 - based @entity40 on @entity7 , the competition between @entity17 and @entity15 serves only to stymie the cause of democracy in @entity7			1
@entity15 has been @entity7 's closest ally since the hardline military took control in a bloodless coup in 1962			1
@entity15 has in the past refused to back @entity1 , saying the matter of her trial was an internal affair			0
@entity15 is building pipelines to ship oil and gas from @entity7 to @entity57 province and is @entity7 's second - largest trading partner -- it is keen to tap @entity7 's mineral , timber and other natural resources needed for its booming economy , analysts say @entity17 also has been investing in @entity7 's power sector as it looks to secure future energy supplies			1
many regional observers say that the generals of the @entity7 military junta , who have remained largely isolationist for 50 years , are more likely to listen to and accept pressure from @entity15 and @entity17 than either the @entity71 , the @entity72 or @entity73 , the political and economic organization			1
" @entity76 is one of the external enablers that have permitted the @entity7 regime to stay the course			0
i am extremely skeptical of what the ruling elite in @entity17 and the communists in @entity15 will do to assist the @entity7 people , " said @entity28			1
both @entity15 and @entity17 have had a difficult relationship with @entity1 , who won a landslide election victory in 1990 with the @entity87			2
the military junta rejected the results and despite the recent freeing of @entity1 , the regime is still holding an estimated 2,200 political prisoners according to @entity93			0
@entity94 , director of the @entity94 , told @entity0 : " @entity15 officials were reluctant to talk to her [ @entity1 ] and @entity17 government officials did n't want to upset the [ @entity7 ] government			1
ordinary people in @entity7 feel betrayed by @entity17 and they see @entity15 as backing the generals			2
" @entity41 , another @entity7 neighbor , buys about 30 percent of its gas from @entity7 , estimated to have been worth $ 3.3 billion in 2008			0
the sales are giving @entity7 a financial cushion , rendering ineffective economic sanctions imposed by the @entity107 and the @entity108 designed to pressure the junta			0
@entity1 recently indicated she might be willing to support an easing of these sanctions			0
" the @entity112 now feel vulnerable because they are so reliant on @entity7 for energy so it would not be in their interests to upset the regime			0
@entity17 's main concern is @entity15 and its potential dominance of @entity7 ... @entity17 does n't want @entity7 to become another @entity15 outpost , " said @entity118 .			1

" @entity15 and @entity17 both have a serious influence on @entity7 , " says @entity28 , @entity29
