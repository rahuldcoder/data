her body was found three weeks later , buried at the home of @entity5 's half - sister , who lived within sight of the @entity41 home			1
the girl 's body was wrapped in plastic garbage bags , and her hands were bound with speaker wire			2
she was clutching a stuffed dolphin -- a toy won for her at a state fair by her father , and which @entity5 allowed her to bring with her when she was abducted			1
" i am not shedding any tears , " the girl 's grandmother , @entity30 , said on wednesday			1
" i do n't feel sorry for him			0
i think @entity57 said , ' @entity5 , it 's time to go			2
' " " i do n't feel sorry for him that he had to suffer , " she said			0

during the search for the girl , as authorities and hundreds of volunteers combed @entity74 , north of @entity99 , police twice visited that home			2
" @entity5 's timeline after he kidnapped @entity4 leaves open the possibility that she was alive , and in the house , at the time of the first and possibly the second interview , " according to a prosecution memo in the case			1
in sentencing @entity5 , judge @entity110 noted @entity5 became fearful of police dogs being used in the area in the search for the girl			2

jurors convicted @entity5 of first - degree murder , kidnapping and sexual battery on a child under 12 in march 2007			1
@entity110 , at @entity5 's sentencing , brought many in the courtroom to tears as he discussed how the girl died slowly as her oxygen ran out			1

" @entity30 's slaying sparked national outrage and led to stricter @entity3 laws regarding registration and supervision of released sexual predators , following a push led largely by her father , @entity4			1
although @entity30 's death was one of several that contributed to the passage of a federal child - protection law dealing with sex offender registration and other matters related to child sex offenses , @entity4 said at the time of @entity5 's sentencing the law does not go far enough			1
on wednesday , @entity4 told @entity0 he is a @entity175 and he believes he will see his daughter again			0
in a jailhouse phone call before his sentencing , @entity5 told a woman described as his aunt he expected the death penalty			0
" i kick myself in the butt a hundred times a day , " he said			0
" stupidity ... just trying to figure out , i 'm just asking myself , ' why was you so stupid ? ' " " well , none of us are perfect , " the woman said , " and the drugs did n't help any			0
" " no , that was a big problem , " @entity5 said			0
" speaking after @entity5 's sentencing , @entity4 referenced @entity5 's earlier comments in which he said that when he got to @entity193 , he would apologize to his victim			1
