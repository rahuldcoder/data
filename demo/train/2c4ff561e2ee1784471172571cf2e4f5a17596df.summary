-- @entity4 's @entity3 has authorized the construction of another 10 uranium enrichment plants , its state news agency announced sunday , further defying international calls to halt its production of nuclear fuel			1
the @entity4 cabinet approved existing plans for five more facilities similar to its current plant at @entity16 and ordered planning for five more to begin , the @entity10 reported			1
the dispatch quoted @entity4 president @entity18 as saying that the new plants will be used to produce fuel for civilian nuclear power stations			1
the move comes two days after the @entity23 , the @entity25 nuclear watchdog , passed a resolution demanding that @entity4 stop construction on a previously secret nuclear facility at @entity29			1
the agency also repeated calls for @entity4 to stop its uranium enrichment program			2
the @entity23 said it would not comment on sunday 's announcement			0
but in @entity36 , @entity35 spokesman @entity34 called the announcement " another example of @entity4 choosing to isolate itself			2
" " the international community has made clear that @entity4 has rights , but with those rights come responsibilities , " @entity34 said in a written statement			0
" as the overwhelming @entity23 board of governors vote made clear , time is running out for @entity4 to address the international community 's growing concerns about its nuclear program			1
" enriched uranium can be used to fuel power plants -- or , if enriched to a much higher concentration , it can be used to make a nuclear bomb			1
@entity4 has said its uranium enrichment program is aimed at producing fuel for civilian power plants			1
but the @entity56 and other countries have accused @entity58 of working toward nuclear weapons , and the @entity23 's friday resolution stated that @entity4 's refusal to comply with international demands " does not contribute to the building of confidence			2
" the resolution had the support of @entity67 and @entity68 -- which had resisted earlier efforts to impose strong sanctions on @entity4 -- as well as the @entity56 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
the @entity56 warned friday that it was prepared to push for significantly stronger economic sanctions on @entity58 following the resolution , but said @entity4 could receive benefits if it fully discloses all nuclear activities to the @entity23			2
@entity4 says it has a right to produce nuclear fuel under the @entity80 , which bars member states from pursuing nuclear weapons and requires international inspectors to have access to nuclear facilities			1
" we have friendly and kind relations with the whole world , but we will not allow even the slightest denial of @entity4 's rights , " @entity10 quoted @entity4 president @entity18 as telling government ministers			1
and @entity4 @entity92 speaker @entity91 criticized the @entity23 resolution sunday , warning that continued international pressure could force @entity4 " to seek another path which will seriously change our cooperation with the agency , " @entity10 reported			0
@entity4 says the goal of the plants authorized sunday would be to produce enough enriched uranium to yield about 20,000 megawatts of electricity a year			2
@entity4 currently has one nuclear power plant , which has yet to begin full operation , and announced plans in 2007 to build 19 more			2
by comparison , 65 nuclear power plants in the @entity56 produced about 800,000 megawatts of power in 2007 , according to the @entity56 @entity110			1
in his final report to the @entity23 's governing board , outgoing director general @entity111 said the agency has been able to verify that no known stocks of nuclear fuel have been diverted from authorized uses			0
but he said inspectors " have effectively reached a dead end " without further @entity4 cooperation			0
" there has been no movement on remaining issues of concern which need to be clarified for the agency to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of @entity4 's nuclear program , " he said			0
in addition , @entity4 has so far refused to sign an agreement with @entity72 , @entity67 and the @entity56 to send its uranium stocks abroad for enrichment in exchange for fuel for a research reactor that produces radioisotopes used for cancer treatment			0
in @entity138 , which has called @entity4 's nuclear program to the dominant threat facing the country , there was no immediate comment from prime minister @entity144 's office on sunday 's development			0
@entity138 is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , though it has never declared itself a nuclear power			0
@entity0 's @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 president says new plants will produce fuel for civilian power plants
@entity3 approves five plants like existing one , says to start planning for five more
" @entity160 is running out for @entity4 to address *...* concerns , " @entity35 says
move comes days after @entity25 nuclear watchdog told @entity4 to stop work on nuke facility
