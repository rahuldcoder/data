@entity0 on sunday conceded defeat in his bid for re-election as @entity5 president , accepting the blame for the result			1
" i carry the entire responsibility for this defeat , and i 'm going to say why			0
i fought for the values of responsibility , and i 'm not a man who does not accept his responsibilities , " @entity0 said from his @entity10 campaign headquarters , as members of the crowd shouted , " no ! " " i 'm ready to become a @entity5 person amongst @entity5 people , and more than ever i have the love for my country deeply ingrained in my heart , " @entity0 said			1
before the election , as opinion polls suggested his rival @entity24 would win easily , @entity0 's camp had been pinning their hopes on the pollsters being wrong			2
analysts had warned that the large share of the vote in the first round for far - right candidate @entity33 , who took 18 % of the vote , could mean problems for @entity0			1
@entity36 said she had cast a blank ballot in the second round , and observers expected many of her supporters to follow suit			0
" the two remaining candidates are political @entity48 twins , so i 'm not expecting very much from the result , " she said after voting in the northern town of @entity45 , according to @entity46			0
@entity0 has fought to keep his job amid a wave of discontent over his inability to rein in unemployment			2
he defended his economic record despite low growth and unemployment at about 10 % , saying the impact of @entity60 's debt crisis could have been far worse			2
@entity5 is a key player in plans to lead the eurozone out of its debt crisis , making the election vital to the region			1
@entity0 's defeat marks the latest -- and most significant -- of at least half a dozen @entity60 leaders swept from office during the eurozone economic crisis , including the @entity73 and @entity74 prime ministers			1
earlier sunday , longtime @entity0 supporter @entity75 said he stood by the president , even as opinion polls appeared to tip in @entity24 's favor			1
" i believe the cards were stacked against him , but i want to believe still that he may have a chance to win , because his campaign was reasonable			0
... i do n't understand why people do not see the reasonableness of his program , even though it 's unpopular , " he said			0
concerns over the economy , unemployment and immigration have been at the forefront of the @entity5 election			2
in his final address friday , @entity0 , of the center - right @entity93 party , picked up on the debate over immigration as he appealed for the nation 's support			2
" i 've always said that @entity5 needs to remain an open and profoundly humanistic country , but there is a reality that is that we have welcomed more people in @entity5 than we can manage , " he said			2
" i 'm not speaking to the right , the left or the center , this is a presidential election			0
i am president of @entity5			2
i must speak to the @entity5 , no matter who they are			0
" he and @entity24 traded insults last week in the only televised head - to - head debate of the campaign			0
@entity0 labeled his rival a liar and a " little slanderer , " while @entity24 accused the president of shirking his responsibilities , cronyism and favoring the privileged over @entity5 's poor			1
the son of a @entity122 immigrant , who did not go to one of @entity5 's elite schools , @entity0 had to fight his way to the top of politics by sheer strength of will			1
the smartest kid in the class , as some describe him , he was not always the most popular though			0
mocked for his lavish lifestyle , and a private life that saw him divorce his second wife immediately after his election in 2007 and go on to marry singer @entity137 , the @entity5 never truly warmed to @entity0			1
he is often known as " quel q'un qui derange , " someone who drives you crazy			0
the reason for their mixed feelings about " @entity0 " was his apparent desire to ruffle feathers and challenge the established order , with his policies to end the 35 - hour week , raise the retirement age beyond 60 and eliminate 160,000 civil service jobs			1
none of these reforms was universally popular and some , at least initially , were roundly condemned			0
but @entity0 believed them necessary and hoped his countrymen would come round to his way of thinking			0
however , as the eurozone crisis swirled , the president received a jolt in january when @entity158 's credit ratings agency downgraded @entity5 from the maximum @entity160 status			1
@entity24 launched a scathing attack on the government 's policies , saying : " we are no longer in the first division			0
" then came the killings in march of seven people , including three young children , by an @entity170 extremist in @entity171 and @entity172			0
election campaigning was suspended by most candidates , but as incumbent president , @entity0 was praised for his handling of the crisis			1
the president received a short - term boost as the massacre diverted attention away from the financial crisis , but the economy and job security were always going to be of most concern to voters .			1
