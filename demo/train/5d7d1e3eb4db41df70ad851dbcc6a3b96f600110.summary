-- @entity1 proved to be just the tonic for @entity3			1
@entity3 had n't lost an @entity5 game at the home of @entity7 since 1995 and the @entity8 maintained that impressive run by topping the @entity10 3 - 0 on sunday			1
@entity11 , meanwhile , has n't been kind to @entity12 recently but the @entity13 thumped @entity14 5 - 0 in the late kickoff thanks to another sterling performance from @entity17			1
@entity12 climbed to second , two points behind @entity20			1
@entity22 's two early goals put @entity3 at ease and ensured the club would n't lose a third consecutive league match for the first time since 2001			1
with @entity20 losing 6 - 3 to @entity27 on saturday , @entity3 made up ground , too , and now trails the @entity29 by 10 points with the busy @entity32 fixture list approaching			1
" it was a good job from us , " @entity3 manager @entity33 told @entity34			1

" we were a bit sloppy in the first five minutes but after that played really well			0
" but he added : " i think we 'll play much better than that			0
i 've told the players that 's the least we can do and we 've got to keep going and keep winning more games			0
" with @entity48 injured , @entity22 earned the start and took advantage of his opportunity			1
@entity3 had joy down the right side and @entity22 was quick to pounce in the 15th minute after @entity54 hit the post with a header			1
it went from bad to worse for @entity58 's young side when @entity22 finished off the good work of winger @entity60			2
@entity7 has registered points from losing positions this season but @entity65 's effort in the 52nd minute erased any hopes of a comeback			1
the assist came from @entity69 , who was making his 500th appearance in club football			0
there was more good news for @entity3 as veteran midfielder @entity74 made his first appearance of the season after battling back from colitis			1
" welcome back mr @entity74 ! " tweeted @entity3 defender @entity78			1
" @entity79 deserved after working so hard after being out			0
" @entity12 had lost five straight in the league at @entity11 and was without injured captain @entity81 and striker @entity82			1
yet even before @entity14 midfielder @entity84 was dismissed for a boot in the chest of @entity17 early in the second half , the visitor controlled proceedings			2
@entity17 -- filling in as captain -- scored twice to boost his league leading tally to 16 and had two assists			2
" it 's no different being captain but @entity12 has only one captain and that is @entity81 , " @entity17 told @entity34			2
" we played very well and this is more important than who the captain is			0
" we played very well			0
for confidence it is very good			0
" @entity14 did n't register a single shot on target			2
" we could have had 11 man of the matches , " @entity81 , working for @entity34 as an analyst , said			0
@entity17 and @entity106 handed @entity12 a 2 - 0 lead at the interval before @entity84 's red card in the 63rd minute			1
@entity111 's first @entity5 goal -- a half - volley stunner -- a @entity17 chip and @entity115 's low finish completed the rout			0
@entity117 rained down at the @entity11 at the final whistle			2
only a few weeks ago @entity14 suffered another embarrassing defeat , 6 - 0 at @entity27			1
" i assume the responsibility of the failure , " said @entity14 manager @entity120			2
" we have to bounce back again like we did after @entity27			0
" in the @entity5 things are n't going as we expected so it 's normal the frustration is there from everyone			0
" @entity14 sits seventh , one spot ahead of @entity3			1
in sunday 's other @entity5 game , @entity130 and @entity131 drew 1 - 1			2
@entity133 scored the opener for @entity131 but was later stretchered off with a suspected fractured ankle			0
" we have to wait a couple of days for an x-ray and a scan , and we all cross our fingers to hope it is not that bad , " said @entity131 manager @entity136			0
" that will overshadow everything else			0
