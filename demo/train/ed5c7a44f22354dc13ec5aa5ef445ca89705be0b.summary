-- the @entity1 takes on @entity2			2
@entity3 takes on his left knee			1
and @entity5 tackles a giant killer			1
here 's what to look forward to during the monday matches at the @entity8 : third time is a charm ? @entity1 fans had a bad feeling while watching the @entity8 draw in december , especially after being picked into a group that included @entity15 and @entity16			1
when it came time to learn the @entity1 ' third opponent , @entity8 nemesis @entity2 was still on the board			0
surely , the soccer gods would n't ... they did			0
perhaps the third time -- @entity2 knocked the @entity1 out of the @entity8 in 2006 and 2010 -- will be revenge			0
the two teams meet monday in a @entity25 opener or maybe it 's not payback time			2
" there 's no revenge factor , " @entity1 goalie @entity27 , who was on both previous @entity8 teams , said , according to @entity29			2
" we do n't feel that			0
that 's not what 's motivating us			2
we think that they 're a good team but we also feel that we are slightly better as well			0
" @entity3 feels swell the body of the world 's greatest player is 100 % fine			1
well , that 's what i 've heard			2
wait , we are talking about @entity3 's fitness , are we not ? he told reporters sunday that when he takes the pitch in monday 's marquee matchup with @entity15 , the @entity16 star said he 'll be ready to go even if he 's feeling a little knee pain -- and though he 's bad at math. " i 'd love to be 110 % and but i am 100 % and that is enough to help my team , " he told reporters sunday , keeping the shirts on their backs it is traditional for players to swap shirts at the end of a @entity8 match			1
but @entity5 's football federation has told its players not to trade			1
not for hygiene reasons , but because they do n't want to buy a bunch of new ones			0
" we are not giving the players a shirt for every game , " @entity68 president @entity67 told the semiofficial @entity70 news agency , according to @entity71			1
" the players have to be economical with the shirts			1
" that might be easier to do monday against @entity79 than saturday when they play @entity80 and @entity81 wants to exchange shirts			1
weather or not @entity85 , extreme heat and humidity and even snow			0
the @entity1 faced all kinds of weather during @entity8 qualifying			0
monday , they may get to do it again			0
when they meet @entity2 in @entity95 , there is a chance of showers			0
@entity1 coach @entity98 does n't want to hear questions about the weather			0
" if it 's raining or if it 's snowing or if it 's thunder and lightning , or whatever , this is about football being played in any circumstances , " @entity98 told reporters , according to @entity102			2
@entity109 reported 50 homes in the area have been evacuated over flooding concerns brought on by nearly 9 inches of rain this weekend			0
reason to love : @entity5 the highest - ranked team in @entity117 wants to bring the plight of the @entity120 cheetah to the world 's attention and has a new jersey with the endangered cat on it			1
there are only 70 to 110 @entity120 cheetahs left , all of them in @entity5 , says conservation group @entity129 .			1

@entity3 says he 's feeling well enough to play in a tough game against @entity15
@entity5 's players have been told they need to be stingy with their shirts
their jerseys are cool with their rare cheetahs on the front
