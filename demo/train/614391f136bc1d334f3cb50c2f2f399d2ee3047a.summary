@entity0 -- you may have been surprised by the about - face by @entity5 president @entity4 who -- after initially stressing the need for urgent action on @entity9 while insisting there was no need to wait for the @entity13 inspectors ' report on the august 21 attack -- said on friday that he now wants to wait for their findings			1
then , saturday in @entity21 after four hours of talks with secretary of state @entity20 , the @entity18 foreign ministers issued a statement blaming @entity9 president @entity23 for the chemical weapons attack , calling it a " blatant violation of international law , a war crime and a crime against humanity " and calling for a " clear and strong " international response			0
but the statement said @entity13 inspectors investigating the incident should report their initial findings before any action is taken			1
what 's going on ? it is all about @entity39 politics			1
@entity39 diplomats say @entity4 seemed to be left hanging when president @entity41 decided to seek authorization for strikes from @entity44			2
he is facing pressure from the @entity5 public and @entity47 for a stronger international backing and @entity13 imprint before taking military action in @entity9			1
@entity39 diplomats tell @entity1 that @entity4 struck a deal with the @entity18			2
in exchange for more @entity39 political support for action , he would wait for the @entity13 inspectors ' report			1
that was the genesis of the @entity18 statement , which now has all 28 countries on record			0
until now , just a few countries were even expressing support for such action , as evident by the fact only 10 countries joined the @entity66 in signing onto the @entity68 statement ( @entity5 , the @entity69 and @entity70 were the only @entity39 nations )			2
@entity18 urges strong response , as @entity20 seeks support for military action you may note @entity76 did not initially sign onto the @entity68 statement friday			0
but on saturday , the @entity76 publicly endorsed it			0
senior @entity66 and other officials in the @entity18 meeting with @entity20 said the @entity76 were the ones that called for the @entity18 to issue this statement			0
although the statement does not explicitly endorse military action , @entity39 diplomats tell @entity1 it is interpreted as tacit approval and political cover for strikes -- once the @entity13 inspectors present their findings -- although it is important to note the @entity18 does remain divided and some countries will never publicly endorse military action , even with the @entity13 report			1
diplomats say waiting for the report does n't really slow up military action for several more weeks -- because the @entity18 statement refers to a " preliminary report " , which it said should be presented " as soon as possible			0
" and as @entity1 's @entity100 has reported , @entity13 secretary - general @entity99 has instructed the inspectors to speed this up			1
so the debate in @entity44 and a @entity13 report should come to a head around the same time			1
' constructive ' talks , but little headway on @entity9 crisis many @entity18 nations need the @entity13 stamp as a legitimacy for supporting action in @entity9 , even politically			2
it does n't have to be a @entity114 resolution			0
it could be something less formal ; it just has to have some @entity13 imprimatur			0
so this let 's everyone get a little of what they want			0
@entity4 gets @entity39 political cover			0
the @entity39 get a @entity13 address and @entity41 gets more international consensus			1
@entity20 told the @entity18 no decision has been made to wait , but he appreciated the statement and would take it back to the president 's national security team			0
officials traveling with @entity20 naturally trying to put a positive spin on this : they did n't expect a statement and see this as a clear show of @entity39 support for action			2
@entity41 may say he does n't have to wait for the @entity13 report -- but @entity4 does , so @entity41 is going to have to deal with it if he wants any @entity39 support , especially from @entity5 .			1

*leaders* decide they want inspectors ' report first
officials want signal of backing from @entity13
it 's a sign of @entity39 politics
