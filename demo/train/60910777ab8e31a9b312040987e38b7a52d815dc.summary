@entity0 , @entity1 -- the pressure suffocated those toiling on the grass , the gravity of a @entity8 final adding weight to the air like plumbing a great depth in the ocean			1
that pressure was only intensified by the anxiety rolling down the terraces of the @entity0 stadium , perhaps world football 's holiest site			2
after four grueling weeks , across 64 games -- where 32 of the planet 's best soccer nations scrapped and shot and passed and passed and passed each other to elimination -- it had come down to this			2
an estimated one billion people were watching , gripped , as the drama unfolded including a lucky , enthralled , 80,000 spectators in the seats of the arena			0
two teams , forged on different sides of the planet , had been locked in combat for 90 minutes without significant advantage			0
defenses had stood resolute , goalposts had been rattled , endeavor had created opportunity that even the great @entity40 had failed to capitalize on			0
normal time had made way for extra time and -- with every energy - sapping minute played -- the @entity46 roulette of a penalty shootout edged ever closer			2
the legion of spectators that stood in the bowl were emotionally intoxicated and called on all superstitious and religious powers at their disposal to deliver them from doom			0
but not all in the arena had lost hope			0
individual mental fortitude is difficult to attain , but at least with self growth the ability to change remains in one 's own hands			2
a collective resilience , a communal resistance to set back , a refusal to be deterred from a group destiny requires careful nurture over years for all involved to believe in the same vision			2
the 2014 version of @entity70 had been patiently planned , engineered and inculcated			0
they 'd waited for this moment for over a decade and now was not the time to buckle			0
" the lowest point came in @entity77 -- that was @entity75 football 's nadir : very poor performances , a very poor team and very poor management , " @entity75 football expert @entity74 told @entity2			1
@entity83 's performance in the 2002 @entity8 , where they lost in the final to @entity86 , helped papered over the cracks , but it would take another two years for the real changes to the national game to filter through			1
" the grass roots reforms were already in place by the time @entity93 took over with @entity94 in 2004 , " added @entity74 , referring to @entity83 's former and current coach			1
" the 10 - year development you 've seen culminate in @entity86 benefited from two changes being made at more or less the same time			1
" youth development was instilled to make sure young players were much better educated and had better facilities and coaching			1
" and at the same time there was a change of philosophy and footballing ideas at the very top -- after 10 years these two elements fused quite brilliantly to deliver the @entity8			1
" you have to credit the chairman of the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) at the time , @entity110 , who realized the needs for reform			0
he was able to get all the @entity116 clubs , including the big ones , on board			0
" they all signed up to create academies and there was a spirit of cooperation , which was especially pronounced in those years , because @entity83 had won the right to host a @entity8 in 2006			1
" there was a real fear the team and the footballing nation might embarrass themselves as hosts if they did n't make changes , " said @entity74			0
@entity83 's blueprint for change did n't come cheap and it needed the clubs to work closely with the @entity109			1
" if everyone is pulling in the same direction it makes a big difference , " added @entity74			0
" you need a lot of money and you need the commitment to do it			0
very few countries could replicate what @entity83 has done			1
" you have to consider they now have 366 centers of excellence for youth development throughout the country			1
" @entity149 has also been the driving force of the national team because they produce the best youngsters , and they buy the best @entity75 players and hone them , to make them even better			1
" it 's no coincidence that when @entity149 did well in the 1970s , 90s and now , the national team has benefited			2
" @entity149 , under former president @entity157 , always kept the greater good of the national team at the back of their minds and that 's an important factor for the success of @entity75 football , " explained @entity74			1
midfield dynamo @entity164 would later dedicate @entity83 's final performance to @entity157 , as the man responsible for many of the players being where they are			1
such long - term planning and dedication to a single goal , by the time the last match was being played in @entity86 in 2014 , was in the final throes of its application			1
the squad and the 11 men on the pitch were the fruition of a design drawn up long ago			0
the path to glory sewn into the psyche of everyone involved			0
with barely seven minutes left on the clock , @entity187 , a man arguably only on the pitch due to injuries to two players selected before him , picked up the ball on the left wing , just inside of the opposition 's half			2
with three @entity197 in front of him he dared to be positive , to run forward with the ball			0
navigating a slim gully on the flank he slithered past the retreating men in blue , ever nearer to the touchline			0
five , 10 , 20 yards he progressed until -- as defenders threatened to force him and the ball from the field of play -- he released a deft cross to the man in white on his right			0
@entity211 , one of seven @entity149 players in the side and a man who entered the field of play as 88th - minute substitute , acted instinctively as if he had executed this maneuver a thousand times before			2
without breaking stride he controlled the ball with a softening of his chest and then , as the near post of @entity223 's goal encroached , placed the ball across his body with a left - foot volley			1
the @entity75 - made @entity227 ball flew into the far side of the net and the three - time world champions of @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 , were once again on top of the footballing world , this time under @entity237 's leadership			1
it was a goal of sublime skill that epitomized all that has been good with @entity94 's side in @entity86 -- in one moment @entity211 's goal ensured @entity75 dream had also come true			1
so what now lies ahead ? @entity83 's future might bright but @entity74 argues they have some way to go to match the traditional global love felt for @entity86 's " a @entity86			1
" " the reality is , as soon as you start winning a lot of things people want to see you fail			0
" you can play beautiful football but people soon want another team to come to the fore , and accuse you of arrogance if you win too easily			0
" @entity83 can still grow as a team with some really exciting youngsters , the likes of @entity265 and @entity266 , coming through , " added @entity74 , referring to the @entity259 and @entity260 attacking midfield players			2
" i think the future is bright , but will @entity83 be adopted as the world 's favorite team ? i doubt it very much			1
" maybe the @entity75 writer will be proved right , maybe there will always be a place in the heart of football fans for the poetry the @entity86 of @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 invoked			2
but @entity86 should not rest on its laurels			0
cooperation for the greater good , investment and commitment to achieve the impossible was the @entity75 solution to their crisis nearly 15 years ago			1
as hosts of the tournament and so - called keepers of the soul of the beautiful game , it would be worth @entity293 football taking note as they experience their own nadir			0
infographic : why @entity86 should have won			0

*mission* *improbable* : @entity83 's @entity8 final win was 14 years in making
@entity302 : poor performance in @entity77 *prompted* new @entity75 blueprint
solution : *emphasis* and investment placed on youth development
result : @entity83 wins @entity311 final with 1 - 0 *victory* over @entity313
