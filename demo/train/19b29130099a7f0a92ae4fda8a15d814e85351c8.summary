@entity0 , a man suffering from schizophrenia in @entity3 's southeastern @entity2 , was forced by his mother to live in a small metal cage for 11 years after he beat a young boy to death			2
reports of @entity0 's dire situation surfaced in @entity3 media last may , accompanied by images of the 42 - year old sitting in the cage in his underwear , his feet shackled by a heavy chain			2
cases similar to @entity0 are not unheard of in @entity3			2
work pressure , the breakdown of traditional family structures , and other aspects of @entity3 's rapid modernization have brought an increase in psychological stress to the population			2
there are often reports of violent , random attacks , killings and suicides			2
one of the most memorable was when a depressed 27 - year - old factory worker tried to feed himself to a pair of bengal tigers at a @entity35 zoo by jumping into their cage last february			2
not enough help the country 's public health system is struggling to keep up with the demand in mental health care			1
around 173 million @entity3 suffer from a mental disorder , according to a 2009 study published in @entity46 medical journal @entity47			1
but there are only 20,000 psychiatrists , equaling 1.5 for each 100,000 people , or a tenth of the ratio in the @entity53			1
professor @entity54 , director of the @entity55 at @entity56 , estimated that only 5 % of people who currently have a mental illness in @entity3 have received psychiatric care from a professional			1
" the factors that affect the low care - seeking rates are many , " he said			2
" lack of awareness that they suffer from a psychiatric condition , lack of locally available mental health services , fear of stigma , belief that seeking psychological help will be useless , costs , etcetera			1
" dubious therapy as a response to the massive demand for help with mental health problems , under - qualified mental health practitioners have sprung up across the country			1
dr. @entity80 - wing , @entity82 - based chairman of the @entity83 , part of the @entity85 , said he receives many complaints from the public			0
commonly complaints are about unregistered psychologists who give unprofessional advice to clients , fail to provide proper assessments and break confidentiality			0
" many people are setting up practices in mainland @entity3			0
some are well - trained , but that 's just a minority			0
because the need is so great , the unqualified can still run their businesses and offer treatment			1
i 've been in contact with patients who feel very angry over services received , sometimes with emotional state worsened during treatment			0
they said they would never see a psychologist again , " said @entity108			0
professor @entity54 agreed that " charlatans occur everywhere " and " there are uneducated subgroups in @entity3 that are gullible			0
" " in terms of professional services there are certainly locations with sub-standard levels of care , primarily because of a lack of trained personnel , " he added			0
' @entity124 ' ironically , while those in genuine need of help have been unable to get any , the government has used confinement in mental institutions as a way to silence political dissenters , human rights activists claim			1
@entity133 , a senior researcher at @entity134 ( @entity134 ) in @entity82 , said it 's a method that has been used increasingly over the past decade , calling it " an absolute violation of medical ethics			1
" one of those alleged to have been a victim of the practice , is @entity141			0
@entity142 say he has been incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital in @entity144 for more than six years			0
@entity141 , they say , had been filing complaints to the central government about corruption and other problems related to the privatization of the state - owned company where he worked			0
these mental institutions are called " ankang " ( " peace and health " ) hospitals and are managed by the @entity154			1
treatments include beatings and electric shocks , according to @entity134			1
as of 2011 , there were some 20 " ankang " institutions operating in @entity3			0
although @entity3 's @entity164 did not directly respond to the allegations , they stated that " @entity3 's mental health organizations strictly follow laws when practicing diagnosis and treatment			1
" they added that diagnoses of mental disorders are made according to the @entity173 and @entity174			1
baby steps the government has taken steps to address the shallow mental health system , such as financing mental health services and provide training for primary care providers			1
most notably , a new mental health law was introduced last year -- it took 27 years to pass the legislation			1
among the most significant changes was a new set of rights for patients , including not being hospitalized against their will			0
despite constructive changes , @entity134 argues that there are still plenty of loopholes			1
" the very first test of the mental health law will be whether those held in psychiatric facilities for political reasons are immediately released , " the organization 's @entity3 director , @entity194 , said in a statement			1
the new law is a big step in the right direction , most commentators say			0
but a voluntary admissions system will further increase the need for more mental health practitioners and community - based services , potentially sending a system already in disarray into further decline			2
while a wholesale reform of the mental health system is needed , one expert says no number of laws and certifications can help therapists gain the most important skill of all : a nuanced understanding of human emotion			1
@entity223 and his wife @entity224 , a psychological counselor , run @entity226 , a counseling and coaching private practice in @entity230 , @entity231			0
part of their business is to train those who wish to become therapists themselves			2
" i met a man from @entity35 with a master degree in psychology who said ' i have learned nothing about inner feelings and emotions ( from school )			0
can you help me to gain those skills ? ' " said @entity223			0
" for me , therapy is almost like art , with a set of ethical guidelines and a holistic health approach			0
" factory life far from home leaves @entity3 's migrant workers vulnerable			0

there are 1.5 therapists for each 100,000 mental illness sufferers
unqualified therapists prey on the weak , worsening their condition
@entity134 says mental hospitals are filled with political *prisoners*
