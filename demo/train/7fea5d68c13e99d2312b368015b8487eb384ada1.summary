-- who -- or what -- is " @entity3 " for ? @entity5 's second movie of the season is a very different kettle of fish from " @entity9 , " which is unpretentious escapism aimed directly at the family audience			1
" @entity3 " is his pedigree picture , the tipsters ' front - runner for the @entity15			1
but the marketing materials are also at pains to stress that this is " an epic adventure for audiences of all ages , " and it 's based on a children 's novel by @entity22 ( by way of @entity25 's acclaimed stage adaptation ) , so i guess the ideal audience would be a teenage @entity15 voter , a history buff with a thing for horses			1
set in and immediately prior to @entity34 , the movie chronicles the experiences of a feisty colt , a thoroughbred who 's named @entity39 by the tenant farmer 's son ( newcomer @entity40 ) , who cares for him and coaxes him to drag a plough through a rock pile			1
sold into the army by the boy 's drunken and penurious father ( @entity45 ) , @entity39 passes from one rider to the next : a @entity51 cavalry officer ( @entity52 ) , a @entity54 hospital orderly ( @entity55 ) , a young @entity57 girl ( @entity56 ) , and so on , in the narrative equivalent of a relay race -- the horse being the baton			1
inevitably this episodic story hits highs and lows			0
@entity5 invests a great deal in the first act , an agrarian melodrama shot in the rosy , romantic style that @entity69 brought to " @entity70			2
" @entity45 plays one of those proud working - class types who will outbid his landlord for a pretty horse just because he likes its spirit ( and has drunk too much spirits himself )			0
the plot builds to a ploughing sequence so overwrought you would think the colt had parted the @entity82			0
@entity84 ' lush symphonic score is a constant presence , while @entity87 's artful lighting is another self - conscious throwback , this time to the classical style of 1940s studio filmmaking			2
( almost as clearly as " @entity91 , " " @entity3 " is @entity93 pastiche , with bits and pieces of @entity96 and even " @entity97 " whipped into the mix. ) the prologue evokes a rudimentary class consciousness that evaporates as soon as @entity39 comes into the possession of @entity103 's gallant cavalry captain -- whose fateful battle charge is one of the film 's most impressive flourishes , and a striking expression of another of the story 's obvious themes , the industrialization of warfare			1
but the movie loses its footing badly in the next two episodes , when the focus shifts away from the horse and on to his minders : two @entity54 deserters , and then a @entity57 farmer and his granddaughter			0
this last is an especially ill - judged interlude , and seems only to have been included as an olive branch toward any young horse - lovers of the female persuasion who may have found themselves at this war movie by mistake			0
the scrupulously neutral and fundamentally banal screenplay by @entity132 ( " @entity134 " ) and @entity133 ( " @entity135 " ) reaches its nadir shortly afterward , when @entity39 apparently " volunteers " to drag heavy artillery through the mud in order to relieve a four - legged comrade he recognizes from their cavalry unit			2
such blatant @entity145 sits very strangely alongside @entity5 's real @entity146 © sistance , a nightmarish , expressionist mad dash across the trenches into the barbed - wire hell of @entity151			1
the animal 's terror and anguish is vivid and horrific , and this long sequence is reason enough to concern parents of preteens			0
we are promised " no animals were harmed " during the filming , but there 's no such guarantee for the little beasts sitting beside you			0
( the film is sensibly rated @entity167			0

" @entity3 " chronicles the experiences of a feisty colt , a thoroughbred named @entity39
the film is @entity5 's pedigree picture -- a front - runner for the @entity15
hard to tell who 's the target audience -- teenage @entity15 voters ?
