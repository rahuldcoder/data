@entity0 -- in her previous life , @entity2 bared her soul -- and a lot more -- as @entity7 's version of @entity8 , a socialite with her own reality show			1
one installment of her 2008 production " @entity12 " featured her sprawled on the floor sporting white , stiletto - heeled boots , a slip and a fur wrap , looking as if she 'd had a tough night on the town			0
but even then , @entity2 tells @entity1 , she was a closet political junkie			2
" during my @entity8 years , " she says with a smile , " i was always saying that i 'm better off in show business and better doing some stuff that people would call cheesy			1
but i would n't do something to betray my political tastes			1
" and political tastes she had			1
the daughter of political icon @entity27 -- the former mayor of @entity29 who helped to launch @entity31 's career in government back in the early 1990s -- is trying to transform herself into a political animal , a talking head , and an opponent of @entity31			1
" i was always feeling something , torn between my respect for the help of mr. @entity31 for my father in early years and for their work together , " she says			1
" but i always was torn between ( my father 's ) work , because he was a democrat and i think would never have dreamt of living in a situation like this in @entity7			2
" @entity2 's favorite look these days is a chic dark blouse , blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail , and a pair of oversized , black - framed glasses			1
it is a cool but serious image , befitting her new incarnation , which began at a key moment last year			0
it was september 24 , 2011 , when @entity31 stunned his fellow @entity7 with the announcement that he , and not the current president , @entity57 , would be running for election -- again			2
@entity31 had become prime minister after serving the maximum two consecutive terms as president			2
" they decided to change @entity57 for @entity31 and @entity31 for @entity62 and then they give out the results , " @entity2 says indignantly			1
" that 's not how it should work and people feel offended			1
" @entity2 exploits her fame and uses her well - honed media skills to get her message across			2
in one political video called " i am voting for ... " @entity2 , her hair disheveled , t - shirt falling off her shoulder , looking straight at the camera with a kind of dull , programmed expression , says she 's voting for " the candidate " ( no name mentioned ) who is " benevolent " and has helped @entity7 to live better			1
" especially now , " she says , " at this time of threat from an ' @entity83 of the @entity85 and @entity86 variety ' you ca n't rock the boat			0
you have to unite behind one candidate			0
" one second after she announces that she is voting for that " candidate " a man tapes her mouth shut , she 's strapped to a chair and armed men carry her off screaming with tongue - in - cheek horror			0
who is @entity2 really voting for ? billionaire candidate @entity96			0
" i do n't think that @entity96 would become the president , " she laughs , " but he 's handsome ! and i would vote for him			0
why not ? " some question @entity2 's new image and her political conversion			1
at one opposition rally where she spoke the crowd loudly booed her			0
@entity31 , she thinks , will be elected president again , but @entity7 is no longer the same			0
" my forecast ? he will try to strengthen and tighten the system , " she says			0
" but now , with the protests on the streets , it 's not possible any longer			0
so it will take , i think , a couple of years of a real protest movement to change the situation			0

@entity2 says she was true to her political tastes even during her " @entity8 years "
though she has reason to back @entity31 , she opposes his run for *re-election*
@entity31 's political manipulation is " not how it should work and people feel offended , " she says
