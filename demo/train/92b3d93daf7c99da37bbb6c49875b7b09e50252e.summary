-- the @entity1 has been a haven for @entity3 's elite since 1912 -- two years before the @entity4 of @entity1 was even created			1
but now some stars are rushing for the exits			2
on monday , a number of celebrities took part in a demonstration across from the famed @entity12 lodge , protesting not the hotel but its ownership -- an investment group controlled by the @entity16			1
in late april , the small @entity18 nation on the northern coast of the island of @entity21 implemented @entity23 law , marked by strong punishments for those found guilty of homosexuality or adultery -- including stoning the convicted to death			1
the law was praised by the sultan , who is n't just the country 's ruler but also a major political and cultural figure			1
" we 're just making people aware , " @entity35 , who was among the demonstrators , told @entity0			2
" it 's not a political issue			2
this is not something that 's debatable			0
... it 's people being stoned to death , " he said			0
a number of organizations have moved -- or threatened to move -- events scheduled for the hotel			1
the @entity50 reported that the @entity51 moved its @entity52 from the @entity1 to the @entity53 in nearby @entity54			1
the awards , which were held monday night , are co-chaired by @entity35 and his wife , @entity56			0
the @entity57 similarly pulled its courage in @entity60 ceremony from the venue			0
" we , the @entity57 , can no longer hold an event at a venue whose owner stands for the violation of the very human rights we fight for , " @entity62 , executive director of the @entity57 , said in a statement			0
also saying they 're staying away , according to the @entity50 : the @entity73 's annual women in @entity75 breakfast , the @entity76 and a fundraising luncheon hosted by @entity78 , a peer helpline			0
moreover , such notables as @entity81 and mogul @entity82 have announced they wo n't patronize the hotel or other properties in the @entity85 of luxury hotels , which owns and manages the @entity1 and the @entity87			1
" i wo n't be visiting the @entity87 or the @entity1 until this is resolved , " @entity81 tweeted to her 28.8 million followers			1
@entity35 said he was well aware of the concerns			0
" i know a number of people are canceling events at the hotel , and it 's all economics , " he told @entity0			1
but @entity95 , the @entity85 's ceo , said the celebrities and groups protesting are taking out their anger on the wrong place			0
" the actions they 're taking are unfounded , " he said			0
" it 's going to hurt our employees and this has nothing to do with them whatsoever , " he said			0
" it 's not their fight			0
" the sultan has owned the @entity1 since 1987			1
the @entity85 was established in 1996 to oversee that hotel and others in its luxury portfolio , including the @entity87 , @entity116 ' @entity115 and @entity118 's @entity117			2
@entity95 said that celebrities wanting to influence politics in @entity121 would be better off lobbying the @entity122 to take action			1
at a briefing monday , @entity122 spokeswoman @entity124 said , " we have very serious concerns			0
" the @entity4 of @entity1 is also making its opinion known			1
mayor @entity129 is introducing a resolution before @entity131 that would urge the sultan to divest his interest in the hotel that bears the city 's name			2
" we have a history of standing strong against injustice , " she said			0
like @entity35 , she emphasized that the issue was n't the hotel , but what was going on in @entity121			1
" the resolution is not a call for a boycott of the @entity1 , " she said			2
" this is really a focus on the government and their laws and not a statement about the hotel			2
" @entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this story .			0
