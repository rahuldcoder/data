-- the first passenger plane equipped with a system to repel shoulder - fired missiles successfully completed its flight , a @entity7 defense and aerospace company announced wednesday			1
the system aims to protect against fire from missile launchers like these , which were used to fire at an @entity13 plane			1
the @entity15 infrared missile - defense system was tested on an @entity17 flight that took off july 11 , according to a statement from @entity19			1
the plane flew from @entity22 's @entity21 to @entity23 in @entity24 , the company said			0
the @entity15 system works by detecting the heat - seeking missiles and then firing a laser , which diverts the missile			1
@entity17 refused to make the system mandatory on all trips but agreed to cooperate with the tests			2
the flight represents the final phase of the @entity34 @entity37 's @entity36 program , designed to test the suitability of missile - protection equipment for commercial aircraft			1
previously , the technology was successfully evaluated on an @entity17 test aircraft and an @entity44 cargo aircraft			2
the missile - protection equipment will be installed on two more @entity17 767 - 200 aircraft for daily cross-country flights through march			1
engineers will evaluate the system 's maintainability and reliability , as well as its suitability for the airline industry			0
no missiles will be fired at these flights			0
" @entity19 worked closely with @entity37 and the airline industry to develop an effective response to potential terrorist threats , " said @entity56 , @entity15 program director for @entity19 in @entity57 , @entity58			1
@entity37 officials said in january that there is no specific threat of these weapons being fired at planes			0
however , @entity68 forces successfully used shoulder - fired missiles against @entity71 helicopters in @entity72			0
terrorists tried in 2002 to shoot down an @entity13 passenger jet in @entity75 with them			0
insurgents hit a cargo plane in @entity79 the following year , but the plane landed safely			0
experts say that about 500,000 to 700,000 shoulder - fired missile weapons have been produced worldwide , and some have been purchased in @entity84 and @entity86 arms markets for as little as $ 5,000			0
since 2003 , @entity87 has pressured @entity37 to adapt military @entity89 technology to commercial aviation			0
@entity19 , based in @entity91 , @entity92 , works with @entity93 , which provided the test aircraft and engineering services for the development of @entity15			2
@entity37 awarded @entity19 a $ 29 million contract in january for this final evaluation phase of the program , which calls for the planes to log about 7,000 flight hours			0
@entity102 , a defense company with its own system to protect planes from portable missiles , urged the @entity106 in march to install its system on commercial flights that take soldiers and equipment to war zones			2
@entity112 , a @entity102 executive , said in march that 27 terrorist groups are believed to possess shoulder - fired weapons , that aircraft are vulnerable to the missiles within 25 miles of airports and that one missile incident could have catastrophic effects on the @entity34 economy			1
in march , the @entity102 system concluded a 14 - month test during which anti-missile systems were installed on 11 @entity125 cargo planes that flew 4,500 flights .			1

system detects heat - seeking missiles , then emits a laser to divert the missile
@entity17 flight becomes first passenger plane to test out " @entity15 " system
@entity15 will be installed on at least two more @entity17 flights
goal is to have an effective response to terrorist threats
