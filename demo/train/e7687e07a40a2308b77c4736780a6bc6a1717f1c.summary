" urgent , " read the @entity1 headline of its september 3 posting			0
" first @entity4 @entity3 fighter captured in @entity5 says @entity6			1
" the @entity9 has captured an @entity11 in @entity5 and @entity12 fighter from @entity4 , the @entity8 - datelined report said			1
two pictures accompanied the report : one showed the captured militant in fatigue pants and a bloodied shirt , lying on the ground ; another showed him escorted by an @entity5 soldier , his face seemingly swollen			1
if true , he would be the first @entity4 national to have been caught fighting with @entity3 militants			1
" we are not able to verify whether or not the information is true , " said @entity4 foreign ministry spokesman @entity22 , responding to a foreign reporter 's question			1
" i can not confirm the information for you			0
" it 's not clear how many @entity4 nationals may be fighting with the @entity3			1
@entity34 , until recently @entity4 's special envoy to the @entity33 , earlier stated that there could be about 100 of them , but @entity22 said he had no specific numbers or estimates			1
@entity4 netizens ' reaction was typically visceral			2
" kill them ! " commented " @entity43 " on the @entity5 news website			2
" we chinese are glad to see these muslims ' death ! " if such reports are true , said @entity4 commentator @entity48 , " this will be an additional evidence that terrorism in @entity4 has a strong international connection			1
terrorism does not care about national borders			0
" it remains unclear if the captured @entity4 national is actually @entity56 , a @entity58 minority group in @entity59 , but @entity48 seems to assume so			1
" in @entity4 terrorism is raising its ugly head and is spreading from @entity59 to other parts of @entity4			2
the underlying drivers for terrorism are mainly the congruence of domestic and international forces at play among some extreme elements of the @entity56 minority in @entity59 , " he added			1
@entity59 , a resource - rich and strategically located region in northwest @entity4 , for years has been beset by ethnic violence , which the government blames on " fenliefenzi " ( " separatists " )			1
@entity56 exiles and rights activists , however , blame the unrest on @entity77 's allegedly repressive and discriminatory policies			1
a spate of violent incidents have been blamed on the @entity80			0
in march , more than 10 masked people , dressed in identical black outfits and wielding machetes , stabbed passengers in @entity85 in @entity87 province , thousands of miles away from @entity77 , killing 29 people and injured 143 others			2
@entity90 killed four of the attackers and arrested one woman			0
in may , terrorists used car bombs to attack an open - air market in @entity96 , the region 's capital , leaving 39 dead and 94 injured			0
the police later blamed the knife and bomb attacks on members of the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) , an @entity103 group founded in 1993 by @entity56 militants seeking an independent state in @entity59 called @entity106			1
the @entity102 has been accused by the @entity4 and the @entity107 of having ties with @entity109 , but security analysts disagree on whether such ties actually exist			2
@entity56 exile groups claim that @entity77 uses the @entity102 as a red herring to rationalize its repressive policies against the @entity80			1
if the @entity5 news report is true , said @entity116 , an international relations professor at @entity117 , it shows that " radicalization transcends boundaries and regions , threatening not only countries in the @entity33 but also @entity4 and the @entity122			1
that said , @entity80 have a long history of fighting overseas			0
i believe that @entity80 fought against the @entity126 in @entity127 , for example			0
so the phenomenon is not a new one			0
" in 2006 , the @entity107 captured 22 @entity56 militants fighting in @entity127 with suspected links to @entity109			1
they were imprisoned in @entity133 for five to seven years and later released after they were reclassified as no longer enemy combatants			0
instead of repatriating them to @entity4 , however , they were sent to @entity138 and @entity139			2
" @entity4 will surely use this to underscore the challenges it faces in maintaining stability in @entity59 , but i do n't think that this will alter the policies being pursued , which seem to be increasing instability and not decreasing it , " @entity117 's @entity116 said			2
@entity77 has stepped up its carrot - and - stick efforts to appease local dissatisfaction and curb violence			1
speaking in a two - day conference on @entity59 in may , president @entity148 promised to enhance " ethnic unity " in @entity59 while creating more jobs , providing accessible education and improving people 's livelihoods			0
@entity148 also pledged to respect the local residents ' legitimate religious rights and local customs " in accordance with laws and regulations			0
" but @entity148 also called for a massive " nets spread from the earth to the sky " to combat terrorists , stating that the stability of @entity59 is " strategically vital to the country 's reform and development as well as national security			0
" in response to the spate of violent attacks , @entity4 has launched a one - year campaign against terrorism			2
@entity4 police in various cities have held anti-terrorism drills using sophisticated equipment such as satellite vans , armored cars and modern weapons			2
bulk purchasers of gasoline are now required to provide identification , secure permits from local police stations and use only approved containers			0
in some places , sales of large knives are controlled or banned			0
local courts in @entity59 have been given instructions to deal with terror cases in a " harsh and quick " manner			0
in june , @entity4 executed 13 people convicted of organizing and leading terrorist groups			2
@entity4 's critics fear the campaign could lead to more repressive policies toward @entity80 , widening ethnic divide			0
for years tensions have been simmering between the @entity202 and the @entity56 minority nationality			1
i saw tensions boil over in the streets of @entity96 in july 2009 , when thousands of angry @entity56 residents , some wielding knives and sticks , rioted in the streets and attacked @entity202 , prompting the authorities to call in truckloads of @entity4 soldiers			1
nearly 200 people died in the ethnic clashes			0
authorities blame separatists for fomenting violence , but critics of @entity4 's policies say the root of the problem is widespread alienation among the region 's @entity56 population who resent strict controls on religion and local culture			1
uighurs also resent the influx into the region of @entity202 migrants , who tend to dominate the local industry and commerce			0
they complain they are being left behind by rapid economic development , and are unable to partake of the benefits from the region 's rich resources			0
all these , critics say , have made @entity59 a breeding ground for malcontents .			0

@entity9 has captured @entity11 in @entity5 and @entity12 fighter from @entity4 , report said
if true , he would be first @entity4 national caught fighting with @entity3 militants
