-- @entity1 should be just two months away from hosting @entity3 's biggest sporting event			1
instead , the country has been barred from taking part in the @entity6			2
national coach @entity7 should be fine tuning preparations for his team , perhaps hopeful of success given that over a third of @entity13 hosts have won the tournament			0
now his team is n't even allowed to compete			0
that was the punishment meted out by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) on tuesday , after @entity1 officials refused to host the @entity13 in january because they fear the spread of @entity19			1
after stripping @entity1 of the right to stage the competition , @entity16 says it is now studying the applications of an unspecified number of countries prior to announcing a new host			1
" these applications are currently under review and the @entity32 will finalize the selection of the successful national association shortly , " @entity28 football 's ruling body said in a statement			1
@entity36 international @entity35 is one prominent @entity28 footballer to support the decision to maintain the scheduled competition dates of 17 january to 8 february			2
" i think the @entity41 should proceed , it has to be played whether in @entity1 or anywhere , " he said on his official @entity40 page			0
" i heard stories about canceling the tournament and i do n't think it is a good thing			0
we should just support the countries that have been affected by the disease and move on			0
" despite knowing where the @entity13 will be held in nine years ' time ( @entity52 ) , @entity28 football fans still do n't know where the tournament will take place in just over nine weeks			1
speculation is feverish as to which country might step in			0
after @entity1 requested its postponement in october , @entity16 contacted several countries to see if they would consider hosting should the @entity62 pull out			1
of those countries , 2013 hosts @entity3 have been the most adamant in saying they do not want the competition			0
@entity36 was also approached but public reaction in the @entity28 nation against hosting the tournament was strong -- and this may be a problem for whichever country eventually stages the finals			1
with @entity16 rules stating that only the host nation automatically qualifies for the tournament , the @entity74 ' elimination was effectively landed when @entity1 decided against hosting the tournament on saturday			1
a letter from sports minister @entity80 informed @entity16 that @entity1 was maintaining the stance it adopted last month , when it asked for a postponement of at least six months to allow sufficient time to contain the @entity19 outbreak			1
@entity16 's decision to disqualify @entity1 comes on the day that the team began preparations for thursday 's match against @entity89 , which had been intended as a @entity13 warm - up			1
' @entity91 ' the ebola virus has so far ravaged three @entity28 countries -- @entity52 , @entity94 and @entity95 -- with 4,960 reported deaths , according to the @entity97 ( @entity97 )			0
on november 3 , @entity16 rejected the @entity1 request for a variety of reasons -- the most prominent of which was that the @entity97 was only recommending the cancellation of large gatherings in those countries most affected by the outbreak			1
@entity1 has been untainted by the virus so far			0
it said its call for a postponement was " dictated by health reasons of the most dangerous kind , linked to the serious risk of the spread of the deadly @entity19 pandemic			0
" the government believed thousands of traveling fans from @entity28 posed a potential health hazard , although @entity16 countered by saying it believed less than a thousand would travel from that region			2
in its statement on tuesday , it also hinted at likely sanctions for @entity1 authorities			2
@entity16 's @entity13 rules suggest that the @entity1 may be in line for a $ 50,000 fine , while there is also the possibility of a further sanction for the team given the late withdrawal			1
@entity1 will still host next month 's @entity128 , saying that few visitors from @entity130 visited the @entity62 nation when it first hosted the @entity133 event last year			2
the @entity13 draw , which had been scheduled for 26 november in the @entity1 capital @entity136 , may now also move , said @entity16			2
the body also added that the forthcoming qualifiers will not change , with the 15 qualifiers set to be determined on november 19			0
most of the interest though will be on the potential sixteenth team in the finals .			0
