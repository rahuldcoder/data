@entity0 -- first @entity2 makes two references to 47 percent			1
then he suggests president @entity4 " starts off with 48 , 49			2
" " these are people who pay no income tax , " @entity2 said at a may fund - raising event that was secretly recorded and is now at the center of a campaign controversy			1
because of that remark , most of the commentary has understandably assumed he was referring at all times to the roughly half of @entity15 who do n't pay income taxes			1
@entity18 : @entity2 's ' 47 % ' - @entity0 's tax break obsession to blame i think not			1
the first reference -- 47 percent -- is the ballpark number smart pollsters in both parties consistently use to describe the president 's most loyal base			2
the math behind that ? begin with the president 's steady support among african - americans , latinos and other non-white voters			2
then add in his backing among white , college - educated women			0
so when @entity2 told the fund - raiser crowd there are " 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what " he was on solid ground and reflecting the consensus of his polling and political team			1
but how he got from that data point to describing @entity4 's coalition as " victims who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them " is a mystery			1
not to mention a sweeping insult to many working - class voters and other taxpayers who support the president			0
@entity2 's remarks huge mistake or plain truth ? in the recording , obtained by the left - leaning @entity57 , governor @entity2 twice uses the " 47 percent " figure pollsters , including his own , suggest is the president 's base			1
moments later he uses the numbers " 48 , 49 , " presumably a reference to the nearly half of @entity15 who , in 2009 , were not represented on a taxable return , according to data from the conservative @entity67			0
in any event , much of what he says in describing these voters is eye - popping			0
' anatomy of a leak ' of the @entity2 video " there are 47 percent who are with him , who are dependent on government , who believe that they are the victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , you name it , that that 's an entitlement and they will vote for this president no matter what			2
" many @entity97 strategists in @entity0 see this as another self - inflicted political wound , and the @entity4 campaign and its @entity102 allies are gleeful for the opportunity to suggest it is proof that @entity2 is disdainful of working - class @entity15 and insensitive to those , who because of economic hardship or other reasons , need government help			1
secretly taped comments put @entity2 back on defense now , to be clear , some grassroots conservatives are not unhappy , and are hoping @entity2 defends his remarks and pushes a debate on government assistance and dependency			1
while a healthy debate about government programs and priorities is always useful , such sweeping generalizations as those used by @entity2 are often a path into political quicksand			2
in 2008 , @entity4 won 95 % of the @entity124 - @entity15 vote , two - thirds of @entity32 , 64 % of other minority voters , and 52 % of white women who are college graduates			2
take another look at those numbers			0
now think all of those voters fit this ? : " these are people who pay no income tax			0
" or this ? : " i 'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives			0
" it was recorded in may , but released seven weeks before @entity141 , at a time when there is mounting evidence that the contest , while still highly competitive , is trending in the president 's direction			0
they say timing is everything in politics			0
the timing for @entity2 here is horrible			0
he needs to be making his case about tomorrow 's economy , not trying to explain away things he said months ago			0
battleground polls : is @entity2 's path to the @entity159 now more difficult ?			1

@entity161 : @entity2 's " 47 % " figure may not be *statistic* about who pays *federal* income taxes
@entity102 are gleeful over @entity2 's comments ; @entity97 strategists in @entity0 see remarks as self - inflicted wound
release of secretly videotaped remarks comes as race appears to be trending in @entity4 's *favor*
