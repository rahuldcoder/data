-- exotic food is part of the global travel experience			0
but recent efforts by conservation groups to ban the much - loved deep fried shark sandwich in @entity7 have proved these experiences are often fraught with cultural difficulties , especially for travelers who like to experiment with new experiences			1
here are some of the more exotic food items travelers might encounter , along with reasons some say you should avoid them			1
@entity17 ( @entity18 ) the ortolan is a songbird found throughout @entity21			0
in @entity18 , home to one of the largest populations , it 's a delicacy traditionally consumed beneath a napkin , because it 's eaten whole , the entire creature devoured in one mouthful			1
the dish featured in the latest " @entity32 " tv series			2
poachers illegally kill thousands every year and the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) estimates that the species has declined by 30 % over the past decade			0
" the population has declined steadily due to illegal hunting purely to satisfy epicurean appetites , " says professor @entity36 , a conservation expert at the @entity37			1
" we have a terrible history of decimating birds like the ortolan , which are hunted solely for illicit profit			0
" shark fin ( @entity47 ) " one quarter of species of shark are at risk of extinction and demand for fins is a substantial component of this threat , " says professor @entity48 , a conservationist at the @entity49			1
you 're mostly likely to come across shark fin soup in @entity47 , where the expensive dish is traditionally served at weddings , or to welcome guests and to show respect at other formal occasions			1
in @entity69 , consumption of shark fins and meat is legal , and @entity70 is the only @entity69 country to ban the controversial practice of finning , which involves removing the shark 's fin and discarding the rest of the carcass at sea			1
recently some airlines and hotels in @entity80 removed shark fin from their menus in response to the controversy and @entity47 banned the serving of shark fin at official government banquets			1
green sea turtle ( @entity89 ) travelers are most likely to find green sea turtle meat in the @entity89 ( where it 's regarded as a national dish and legal to consume and breed the species ) , throughout the @entity95 , @entity69 and some of the @entity97 southern states , although it 's illegal to import , sell , or transport the species in the @entity97			1
diminishing numbers and the widely condemned breeding conditions found at the world 's only legal breeding facility in the @entity89 mean travelers should avoid this dish , according to some			1
" whilst some local communities may depend on turtle meat for subsistence and cultural reasons , there 's no need for travelers or tourists to eat this endangered animal , " points out @entity107 at the @entity108			1
@entity118 ( @entity47 ) if you 're keen to impress friends with tales of exotic foods the pangolin might tick the box , but increased demand has wreaked havoc for the creature , despite its unappetizing appearance			1
you 're most likely to find a plateful of pangolin in @entity47 , where it 's now illegal to hunt the animal			1
the pangolins ' secretive , solitary and nocturnal habits have made it hard to estimate numbers , although records point to a sharp decrease			0
7 ways to save the pangolin " pangolins look like armor - plated lizards , but are shy , nocturnal mammals , " explains @entity141 , director of campaigns and communications at @entity108			0
" the wildlife trade network traffic has reported that the insatiable demand for pangolin meat has decimated populations and demand from @entity47 is now seeing pangolins in @entity153 being hunted for the @entity69 restaurant market			1
" @entity155 ( @entity156 ) the @entity155 's native home is @entity156 , but the threat of extinction looms large due to hunting for human consumption			1
it 's one of only two species of mammal to lay eggs ( the other is the platypus ) , and is key to understanding mammalian evolution			0
the @entity156 government has banned commercial hunting but traditional hunting with dogs is permitted			2
they 're now incredibly rare in @entity156 , but breeding programs carried out by zoos in other countries are going some way to safeguard the species ' future			0
mountain chicken / giant ditch frog ( @entity180 , @entity181 ) this super-sized amphibian may not look too appealing as a delicacy , but its popularity in the @entity95 has seen the population decline by 80 % over the past decade			2
the meat regularly appears on restaurant menus , although it 's now only found on @entity180 and @entity181			2
the @entity34 , which lists the species as critically endangered , says up to 36,000 were being killed every year as recently as 2002 , and estimates there are now just 8,000 remaining			2
@entity190 ( @entity191 ) gorillas have been pushed to the brink of extinction due to their popularity as bushmeat			1
in cities such as @entity198 in the @entity191 , smoked gorilla meat is sold openly ( but illegally ) at markets			2
it 's believed that more than 400 gorillas are killed for bushmeat every year , despite the fact that the species is listed as critically endangered by the @entity34			2
the species ' low productive rates mean that even low levels of hunting have a devastating effect on populations			0
@entity212 ( @entity47 ) @entity47 giant salamanders are the largest species of amphibian and live in lakes and rivers in southern @entity47			2
over the past 30 years , over-harvesting for the food trade -- they sell for $ 1,000 a piece -- has seen an 80 % decline in numbers , and it 's now classed as critically endangered by the @entity34			0
@entity223 has n't just threatened its survival but stunted its growth -- scientists believe that hunters ' preference for larger salamanders is the reason they no longer grow beyond six feet in length			0
" @entity212 should always be avoided , " says @entity232 at the @entity233 and @entity234			0
" this species has declined to extremely low levels			0
" @entity237 ( @entity238 , @entity70 ) sale of dolphin meat for consumption is common and legal in @entity238 , although it 's often mislabeled and sold as whale meat , which sells for much more			0
although the way in which the dolphins are killed is controversial , most notably as highlighted by the movie " @entity248 , " none of the species being hunted in @entity238 are listed as endangered			0
in @entity70 , the catching , selling and consumption of dolphin meat was banned in 1989			0
despite this , 1,000 dolphins are caught illegally there every year and dolphin fishcakes are often sold openly at street food stalls , especially in @entity70 .			0
