@entity0 -- one recent afternoon , two 17 - year - old migrant workers from the nearby province of @entity4 came to an electronics market in this @entity7 metropolis with one goal in mind : to purchase a smartphone			1
they browsed a couple of different models , before settling on a @entity14 for 1,200 yuan ( about $ 180 )			0
they traded in their old cell phones , good for nothing much more than making calls , sending text messages and maybe playing a few games			0

the other said he did not really know how to use such a gadget			0
@entity31 , manager of the cell phone stall , said nearly all of his customers who have migrated to @entity0 from elsewhere for work are opting to purchase smartphones rather than low - budget fake phones that have long been a staple technology of @entity7 's marginalized populations			1

" they are more advanced now			0
they want a better life			0
they use these [ smartphones ] because they can know news very fast and share information with others			2
" @entity7 is on the verge of a smartphone revolution			1
falling prices of handsets made by foreign brands paired with domestic manufacturers churning out cheaper and cheaper devices , combined with faster and more affordable data plans , means @entity7 will overtake the @entity58 as the largest market for smartphones this year , according to market intelligence firm @entity61			1

countless entrepreneurs are working to create applications and other software for the coming mobile web explosion that will be fueled by widespread smartphone adoption			2
even simple handsets have enabled @entity7 's migrant workers to find jobs , communicate with family back home , organize into groups and access information			1
for migrant populations , such technology has served to " liberate workers culturally " and " restructure the social identity " of migrants , according to @entity85 , editor of " @entity86 in @entity7 : virtual , @entity88 and local interactions			1
" it is hard to say how many migrants now have smartphones			1
anecdotal evidence suggests their uptake , especially among younger migrants in urban areas , is quickly becoming widespread and that the technology is enabling them to connect with broader segments of @entity7 society in ways they never have before			1
" @entity7 has long had a very active , even militant , working class , " said @entity101 , an assistant professor at the @entity103 's communication and journalism school , who researches information and communication technologies and their impact on labor movements in @entity7			1
" they have always been socially engaged but usually they stay under the radar , but now there is a new window for us to see what is going on			0
" that new window is specifically @entity117 , @entity7 's largest microblog , most commonly referred to as a mainstream social media channel for the middle class			1
now migrant workers are starting to take part , and in some instances people are paying attention			2
this summer , for example , a migrant @entity126 successfully stopped the closure of a school for migrant children in @entity131 after posting their grievances on @entity117			0
public intellectuals , television hosts , even state - run media , became involved in supporting their cause			0
" this is all possible because they have smartphones , " @entity101 said			2
" but the most essential ingredient is the workers want to have their voices heard , and they are facing existential issues			2
technology is of no use if no one has the political will			2
" @entity101 said similar efforts to stop recent government crackdowns on workers ' rights groups in the southern province of @entity153 have not been as successful			2
" the @entity131 case -- that was a rare case , " he said			0
" it was almost like a little miracle			0
" read related : mobile phones used to get past @entity7 's @entity160 censors nevertheless , more migrants , particularly those in factories , are creating what @entity101 calls " worker generated content " about their working conditions and sharing it with wider audiences			1
some migrants are garnering thousands of fans on microblogs where they share personal experiences and feelings that have rarely been voiced outside their immediate social circles - if at all			1
" am going to bed now , " posted one migrant who writes under the name " @entity179 " on @entity117			0
" good night to this hypocritical , pretentious , two - faced world			0

where is the road ? " " there are more and more stories like this , of migrants trying to vent their grievances through smartphones , " said @entity199 , author of " the internet in @entity7 : cyberspace and @entity207			1
" " it is not a dramatic change yet in that sense			0
