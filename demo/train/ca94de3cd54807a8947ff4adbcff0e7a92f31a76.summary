@entity0 -- the premiere of " @entity10 " took place in @entity4 , @entity5 , on december 15 , 1939 , but not without a territorial struggle of its own , a war between the states of @entity9 and @entity5			1
producer @entity11 of course wanted it in @entity14			0
but @entity15 , the feisty mayor of @entity4 , with a rampant @entity16 and the full force of its citizenry behind him , argued it was " their " story and won the day			1
@entity11 was terrified that he and the hyper - glittery event would be ridiculed by @entity23			0
@entity27 , by then a @entity25 winner and long past her scapegrace flapper days , was terrified the movie would be a vulgar travesty , embarrassing her in front of her friends			0
it was , of course , a triumph -- for the @entity36 it was like a sweet vindication for their humiliation at the hands of @entity42 's army			0
for @entity11 , the biggest gamble of his life would go on to win 10 @entity46 and become a success beyond his wildest dreams			2
in its day the longest and most expensive film ever made , it had cost $ 4,250,000 to produce			1
it would go on to become a global hit and , with dollars adjusted for inflation , it remains the biggest blockbuster of all time			1
but the tensions and ironies present at the premiere were an indication of fault lines that , without ever completely tarnishing the film as an audience favorite , would plague its 70 - year history			1
how could it not be so in a movie that told " our " nation 's history , the @entity67 and @entity70 , from the unreconstructed @entity36 's point of view ? a hundred - thousand people turned out on a bitter cold night and there were bands on every street and old men marching in @entity78 uniforms			0
the stars arrived in full force ... the white ones , that is			0
not permitted to attend the premiere in segregated @entity4 were the black cast members , including @entity84 , who would go on to win an @entity46 for her portrayal of @entity86 ( and would be the first black to do so )			1
among the three days of festivities was an all - white @entity16 ball serenaded by the @entity90 , an all - black boys choir directed by the rev. @entity92 and including a 6 - year - old @entity93 among its members			1
many of the young who watch " @entity10 " today are horrified -- not only are all blacks slaves , but they are also apparently content with their lot ; reconstruction is an unalloyed disaster			1
yet calling the movie racially retrograde is a misnomer			0
it is very much of its time and place , it 's just that we ca n't bear to look at that time and place -- itself a mark of how far we 've progressed			2
most critics today would n't touch " @entity10 " with a 10 - foot pole -- it 's easier to dismiss it as racist or overblown or an apologia for the plantation culture than to take a fresh look at how it has fared and why it has endured for 70 years			1
i 'm speaking from experience , as i recently published a book about " @entity10 " -- the novel and film			1
while doing some @entity126 interviews and responding to listeners ' questions , i was struck by how the film continues to raise tempers and inflame feelings			2
an elderly gent from @entity133 ranted on about @entity42 's burning of the local church , while a youngish black woman said the movie should be consigned to the dustbin of history ... after admitting she 'd seen it 500 times			2
but no less surprising was the huge number of well - considered ( and favorable ) online responses -- a long , thoughtful appreciation by a black female historian , another from a black male librarian in @entity147 , and other passionate pro- " @entity10 " responses from across the spectrum , some under the guise of " guilty pleasure			1
" young - ish black women have told me of responding to the book as teenagers , much as i did , even reading it under the covers with a flashlight			2
for my generation , @entity159 was outspoken , a renegade , a feminist in hoop skirts , maybe the first of a long line of teenage rebels with a barely defined cause , a vendetta against grown - up hypocrisy			0
for my generation of ' 50s adolescents , it was the book 's raciness that made it deliciously taboo ( @entity27 said her own mother would n't have let her read it until she was 18 )			0
for young black teenagers in the ' 70s and ' 80s , it was n't the raciness as much as the rebellion , the stubborn selfishness of @entity159 -- and they were defying parents who would be horrified to know their daughters could sympathize in any way with a slave - owning plantation mistress			2
yes , the movie may be overblown , may be guilty of giving the @entity36 an undeserved moral victory , yet it tells a complicated story in swift , riveting brushstrokes , pulls out all the emotional stops so that even those of us not besotted with the film can hardly resist individual scenes : just try to stop watching once engaged			1
crafted by the geniuses of the studio system , " @entity10 " is a panoramic epic that never loses sight of its main characters , and -- also startling to young viewers today -- those characters endure vast quantities of pain and suffering in a world turned upside down			1
there are star - crossed lovers ( the fierce beauty of @entity209 , the gentleness beneath the swagger of @entity212 ) , the agony of war , of economic loss and devastation , the resilience of a woman who wo n't accept defeat			0
most original of all is @entity159 herself ( you hate her and you love her ) , a heroine of ambiguous morality who is revolutionary in @entity14 terms in that she refuses to be chastened , brought to heel , transformed by love			0
the movie crosses race and gender lines and shows that single - issue sympathies are out of date			1
we can finally take a more nuanced approach , appreciate just how majestic @entity84 's performance is			0
( when she was criticized at the time by the @entity237 she famously retorted , " i 'd rather get paid $ 700 a week playing a maid than $ 7 a week being one			1
" ) after the controversy , @entity14 made a concerted effort to expand roles for blacks			0
it has been a slow and arduous process as we can see by the fact that despite a record number of @entity249 performers , no black director has won an @entity46			0
but if there 'd been no " @entity10 , " it might have started later and taken even longer			2
the movie is a cultural touchstone that , as one reader wrote to @entity257 , " shows us not only where we 've been , but also how far we 've come			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			0
