-- let 's be clear about this : the embargo on @entity4 should have been lifted a long time ago			1
and yet it 's hard to avoid the impression that although president @entity8 had an overwhelmingly strong hand in negotiations , he played it badly			1
badly , that is , for the sake of the @entity4 people			2
what occurred on wednesday , and the @entity8 administration 's announcement of a momentous change in @entity19 policy toward @entity4 , is certainly important to the @entity19			1
but it means even more to @entity4 -- it is a major landmark in the country 's history , one of the most pivotal events since the takeover of the government by @entity27 and his band of revolutionary brothers in 1959			2
for decades the @entity27 regime -- first under @entity27 and now under his brother @entity31 -- have made the lifting of the @entity19 embargo , " the blockade " as they call it , a centerpiece of their rhetorical arsenal and their principal demand in domestic and international forums			1
now , @entity19 has agreed to work toward lifting the embargo and normalizing diplomatic relations			1
yet despite @entity41 having significant leverage as the @entity4 economy teeters and low oil prices threaten to sever its @entity46 lifeline , the @entity19 secured virtually no meaningful concessions			1
@entity4 remains one of the world 's most politically oppressive countries			2
at the very least , therefore , the agreement to restore relations should have included substantial commitments on @entity55 's part to relax the state 's grip			0
of course , the release of the unjustly incarcerated @entity60 is welcome			0
but his release should have been viewed not as a bargaining chip , but as a prerequisite to any deal at all			0
instead , there was a separate exchange of spies , which @entity4 treated as a major victory			2
the only concession that has been reported upon is @entity55 's agreement to release about 50 imprisoned dissidents			0
this leaves millions of @entity4 still under the thumb of a repressive state			2
with that in mind , the main goal of @entity19 policy toward @entity55 should be helping the @entity4 people live in prosperity and freedom , able to enjoy the benefits of modernity , complete with the right to free expression and participation in the global economy			1
by beginning to lift the embargo , material conditions in @entity4 are likely to improve -- and that is most welcome -- but the process of introducing political freedoms may or may not advance			1
it 's not surprising that the agreement was judged with skepticism by many pro-democracy activists in @entity4			0
the dean of @entity4 dissidents , @entity99 , reportedly declared , " @entity100 has won			0
" he welcomed the renewal of dialogue but told @entity103 he foresees no improvement in human rights as the result of the deal			0
the leader of the opposition group @entity108 , @entity109 , called @entity8 's decision a mistake , adding that " democracy and freedom for the @entity4 people are n't going to be achieved by what @entity8 has given to the @entity4 government			1
" barely a week ago that repression was in full view of the @entity4 people and a smattering of foreign journalists in @entity55			1
on december 10 , @entity122 , a familiar scene unfolded in @entity55 as authorities took away would - be peaceful demonstrators before they had a chance to assemble even in small numbers			0
at least 240 people were arrested , according to one dissident group			0
@entity131 , for its part , says the government continues to use beatings , public shaming and intimidation against regime critics , adding that arbitrary arrests have " increased dramatically in recent years			0
" indeed , i 've witnessed such incidents myself over the course of at least a dozen trips to @entity4 over the years , watching plainclothes agents and regime thugs beat up anyone even daring to utter the word " democracy			2
" true , not everyone in @entity4 is pessimistic			0
many of those who have struggled under grinding economic difficulties understandably just want to see their standard of living improve , and there is excitement on the island and hope that major economic changes could be around the corner			0
yet welcome as improving economic well - being is , it would be tragic if this unique chance to usher in freedom is lost			1
the sight of @entity162 -- the aging , unelected @entity4 leader -- wearing his military uniform as he announced on television that @entity41 and @entity55 will restore ties " without renouncing any of our principles " reminded me of a conversation i had with a @entity4 @entity171 official back when communist regimes were collapsing around the world			0
he told me that he thought @entity4 would seek to follow a @entity177 model , meaning that like @entity177 's @entity179 , the @entity4 regime would try to keep its grip on power , even if its socialist economic model is conclusively proven to have failed			1
will @entity4 choose that path ? certainly , @entity8 had the opportunity to nudge the country off this course , and instead toward freedom			1
in fact , it is not too late for his administration to do so			0
so , as the @entity19 moves to dismantle the old , failed embargo , let 's hope it plays its hand with greater skill on behalf of the @entity4 people moving forward , and extracts from the government verifiable progress on human rights and individual freedoms			1
it is time to help @entity4 and its people rejoin the modern world .			2

@entity205 : embargo on @entity4 should have been lifted a long time ago
but president @entity8 *squandered* a strong negotiating hand , @entity208 says
the @entity19 secured virtually no meaningful concessions from the @entity4 regime , she says
@entity208 : it would be tragic if this unique chance to usher in freedom is lost
