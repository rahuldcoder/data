@entity0 -- an @entity3 tie			1
it 's the white whale of @entity6 elections : elusive , mythical and never realized			0
but could it finally happen this year ? the likelihood that president @entity10 and @entity11 will each net 269 electoral votes in november , instead of the 270 needed to win , is actually not so farfetched -- and for close observers of the @entity3 system , a tie would set off a wave of constitutional and political mayhem that would make the 2000 @entity18 recount seem like a tidy affair			1
check out the @entity1 electoral map and calculator election results in key states would immediately be subject to legal challenges			2
electors , normally an anonymous batch of party insiders elected to ratify each state 's winner with their electoral votes , would be lobbied to change their votes by friends , neighbors and political leaders			1
ultimately , the @entity35 could elect the next president , even if that candidate lost the popular vote			1
" what it would reveal is that we have , in some sense , a profoundly undemocratic mechanism for dealing with a tie , " said @entity39 , a professor of history and social policy at @entity42 , and a critic of the @entity3			2
" i think there would be an enormous outcry over that			0
" a quick reading of the electoral map shows that the prospect is startlingly real			0
this year 's list of battleground states is now familiar to anyone following the race			0
the campaigns and their allies are spending money in states where the polls are tight : @entity65 , @entity18 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
by the numbers : why @entity65 matters @entity72 say @entity73 is in the mix. @entity75 insist the same is true for @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , where @entity11 has family roots			2
strategists inside both campaigns agree , for now , that the 2008 battlegrounds of @entity83 and @entity84 are all but certain to go red , while @entity85 is likely to stay blue			0
so using those parameters , here 's one plausible scenario in which no candidate wins an @entity3 majority in november : @entity11 tears up @entity10 's 2008 map and wins @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity65 , @entity18 , @entity73 and @entity67			1
@entity10 , meanwhile , keeps @entity68 , @entity66 , @entity76 and @entity77 in the @entity72 column			2
that combination of states adds up to 269 votes for each candidate -- and that 's just one of several realistic scenarios yielding the same outcome			1
a handful of paths involve @entity77 and @entity76 , two blue - leaning states that @entity72 insist are off the table for @entity75 ( even though the @entity10 campaign has spent heavily in @entity76 on television ads attacking @entity11 )			1
also in the mix is @entity109			0
the state awards its five electoral votes by congressional district , and the @entity114 - anchored 2nd @entity113 sent a single vote to @entity10 in 2008			1
the @entity10 campaign has been organizing in the @entity114 metro area for months , and the @entity117 is opening a field office there in the coming weeks			2
both campaigns know that just a single electoral vote could play a decisive role in what 's expected to be a historically close race , and that makes what happens in the event of an @entity3 tie all the more intriguing			1
both political parties begin coordinated ad efforts with the campaigns the rules governing the process -- outlined 208 years ago in the @entity132 -- seem straightforward			0
the @entity35 tallies up the electoral votes in a special session of the next @entity135 in january , and if no candidate reaches a majority , then each state 's delegation in the @entity35 casts a vote for president			1
the last time a " contigent election , " as it 's known , occurred was 1824			0
after the unresolved presidential election of 1824 , when none of the four candidates achieved an @entity3 majority , the @entity35 met the following january to decide the outcome			1
after a good bit of politicking from all the candidates , the @entity35 awarded the presidency to @entity152 , even though @entity153 had won the most electoral votes			1
this is the model that will be used if @entity10 and @entity11 find their fates in the hands of @entity135 in january			1
according to a report on contingent elections by the @entity161 , the procedures undertaken for that 1825 vote -- the @entity35 met in closed session without reporters , for instance , and voted anonymously by paper ballot -- would be " precedential , but not binding " for similar elections in the future			1
but a modern - day version of that pageant play is guaranteed to be messier and far more dramatic , election scholars say			0
if @entity11 and @entity10 both finish on november 6 with 269 electoral votes apiece , the true results will not be known until december 17			1
that 's when the electors -- @entity72 and @entity117 loyalists nominated by state party officials and placed on the ballot alongside the presidential candidates -- meet in their respective state capitals and the @entity0 to formally cast their electoral votes			1
that has become a mostly irrelevant exercise in recent presidential elections			0
but in the event of a razor - thin finish , or a 269 - vote tie , every elector will suddenly wield great power			1
a handful of states have " faithless elector " laws on the books designed to punish electors who switch their votes , and some two dozen states require electors to pledge to vote for the state 's winner			1
" if there appears to be a tie , then faithless electors become a big problem , and we could have a real mess on our hands , " said @entity202 , a constitutional law professor at @entity203 who has written extensively about the @entity3			2
many recent electors have mulled switching their votes and little can be done to stop them , said @entity212 , an @entity3 expert at @entity213			2
what are the most important issues to you ? in the course of writing a book on presidential electors , @entity212 interviewed more than half of the electors who participated in the 2000 , 2004 and 2008 elections			0
of the 2004 group , 10 % said they considered voting for someone other than to whom they were pledged			0
in 2008 , 11 % said the same			0
many told @entity212 they were lobbied or pressured by someone to change their allegiance -- sometimes in person , sometimes by anonymous e-mails and phone calls -- in the period between @entity233 and mid-december , when the @entity3 votes			2
" if it 's really close , you would expect to see massive lobbying campaigns , " @entity212 said			0
" most do follow the herd , but not all , and that becomes the question in a close election			0
what happens at the margins ? " despite being party loyalists , he said , electors are regular people with their own biases and political inclinations			0
in rare cases , they make them known			0
in 2000 , @entity0 elector @entity250 abstained from casting her electoral vote as a protest against the @entity0 's lack of voting representation in @entity135			2
in 2004 , an anonymous @entity256 elector voted for @entity257 instead of @entity258			0
throughout this past spring and summer , @entity260 's devoted supporters worked furiously to elect their own as electors at state party conventions			2
" they are trying to be the revolution to the @entity3 , " @entity212 said			2
if the electors behave in december and affirm an @entity233 split decision , the action would move on to the @entity35			2
a joint session of the newly elected @entity135 would be convened to open and count electoral votes			1
a @entity35 leadership aide told @entity1 this would happen on monday , january 7			1
if no candidate reaches a majority of 270 votes , a contingent election immediately ensues			0
in the @entity35 , each state 's delegation casts a single vote for president			1
this scenario all but guarantees a victory for @entity11			0
@entity75 hold a majority in 33 state delegations to 16 delegations for the @entity72			0
barring a miraculous @entity72 wave up and down the ballot this november , the axis of power is unlikely to shift enough to hand @entity10 's party control of a majority of state delegations			1
and there 's another hiccup : the vice president is elected separately by the @entity295 , which may still be controlled by @entity72 next year			0
each senator has a single vote , and the next vice president would be chosen by a simple majority vote			1
a @entity11 - @entity301 administration ? no one 's betting on it			1
if you 're voting this election season , we want to hear why			0

the likelihood that @entity10 and @entity11 each net 269 electoral votes is not so far - fetched
a @entity1 *analysis* finds eight scenarios that could yield a @entity3 tie
in the event of a tie , each state 's @entity35 delegation casts a single vote for president
