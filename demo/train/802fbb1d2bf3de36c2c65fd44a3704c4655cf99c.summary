prisons in developing countries can usually be characterized as hazardous and chaotic places for offenders			0
due to limited resources , the prisons are left to be run by ruthless gangs			1
in the @entity11 prison in northern @entity12 , the decapitation of inmates by a rival gang highlights " the lawlessness " within @entity12 's correctional system			1
prisons in the @entity16 bear many similarities			1
however , the @entity16 prison system is about to go through reformation following last year 's passing of the @entity21 by the @entity22			1
plans include the building of a new super-max facility to replace @entity26 ( @entity27 ) to reduce congestion and eliminate gangs within the system			1
but is this the right path ? from over four years of ethnographic research we have conducted in @entity27 , we do n't think so			1
gangs dominate prison @entity27 , on the outskirts of @entity37 , is one of the world 's largest maximum - security facilities			1
recent statistics we have collected from the @entity42 , which administers @entity27 , has the inmate population to be now exceeding 14,200			2
with space for only 5,500 , this makes the congestion rate around 260 per cent			2
around 95 % of inmates belong to 12 gangs that share control of the prison			1
in these overcrowded conditions , corruption is endemic and contraband , such as drugs and high - calibre weapons , is readily available			0
over the past three years , prison raids have uncovered automatic machine pistols and other lethal weapons held by gangs			1
two @entity61 hand grenades have also been thrown during gang disputes			2
we have observed how easy it is for inmates to acquire mobile phones			2
the telephones facilitate criminal activity on the outside to be freely run from the inside			0
from all this , one can easily conclude that , like @entity73 prison , @entity27 is dysfunctional			2
however , from participant observation studies and over 100 informal interviews with gang leaders , inmates and prison officials , we have developed an alternative perspective on prison gangs			1
why gangs are important while there is no doubt that gangs are responsible for much of the criminality inside , we found that the gang system ( or @entity87 ) is not exclusively about crime			1
in fact , many inmates are kept busy with legitimate activities and " do their time " productively			2
since their inception in the late 1940s , @entity27 's gangs have come to form a crucial part of inmate management and welfare			2
much of the negative publicity about @entity27 only captures a small part of the reality inside			0
there are , in fact , many positive aspects of gang life in the seemingly chaotic conditions that are often overlooked yet crucial for inmate survival			2
when prisons become overcrowded and the inmate - to - staff ratio exceeds safe levels ( that is , 4:1 ) , the essential task of maintaining order and ensuring the safety and welfare of inmates becomes complex and problematic			2
to carry out these critical tasks , prison administrators are forced to not only compromise organizational integrity , but also relinquish aspects of their management function to inmate leaders			2
in @entity27 , with an inmate to guard ratio of around 80:1 , it has become unofficial practice to operate under a system of shared governance			0
by default and not by design , gang leaders help maintain internal control and safeguard inmates as best they can			1
even though prison stability is fragile , gang leaders help prison guards restore stability once disorder occurs			1
but prison gangs are not all about maintaining order			1
they also provide inmates with a network of social support , access to material benefits and a source of income			2
without these , survival becomes difficult for many			0
' @entity148 ' gangs also develop their own rehabilitation and educational initiatives , which are separate to the more resource - constrained programs offered by prison administrators			1
in another important feature , gangs provide a substitute family for those who have lost contact with outside relatives			2
fellow gang mates become brothers and the inmate leaders their fathers ( or big brothers )			0
inmates have told us that it is common for them to call their leaders as " tatay " ( father ) or " kuya " ( older brother ) , a @entity16 cultural dynamic that orders the social standing of inmates			1
additionally , inmates are sometimes called " tatay " or " kuya " ; a recognition of their respectability and an early indication of their leadership potential			0
a gang leader stated to us that , as a general rule , those who are industrious , cunning and can produce the most resources are usually elected leaders			1
inmate leaders also help manage the prison cell blocks , which is akin to running a mini-city with its own micro-economy			0
like a city , leaders are elected , generate income and manage resources to meet the needs of their constituents			0
they also respond to emergencies and diffuse conflicts			0
they take responsibility for offenders with special needs by controlling violent offenders , caring for the sick and disabled and even monitoring terrorist inmates			0
to ensure they remain in office , leaders also host sporting activities and entertainment programs like rock concerts and tv shows			0
to the casual observer , @entity27 may seem more like a self - sustaining community than a high - risk volatile correctional institution			0
the lanes that criss - cross the prison are crowded with inmates working , cooking or playing sport			1
on most days , inmates with families roam the grounds			0
it is also common to see children playing or looking at animals in the small zoo			0
it is evident that one of the most beneficial features of this set - up is the inmates ' sense of community			0
even though one is inside a prison , the outside environment is being mirrored here			0
evolution of prison life in modern sophisticated open prisons like those in @entity242 , correctional officials have found that progression through a sentence should be aimed as much as possible at returning inmates to the community			1
they assert that " the more closed a system is , the harder it will be to return to freedom			0
" thousands of miles away , we can see that , left to evolve almost by accident , @entity27 has progressed towards a similar model			0
while @entity27 was originally built as a closed , @entity257 style high - security facility , over time , the walls have become porous , security has lapsed and deals have been made with inmate leaders to ensure prison order			1
consequently , compromises have been made to allow more inmate autonomy			0
even mobile telephones , formally considered contraband , are unofficially accepted by prison administration and considered important for rehabilitation as they keep inmates in contact with family			1
as in @entity242 prisons , @entity27 administrators have come to realize that regular family communication helps " sustain emotional ties , " as well as giving inmates outside avenues to vent and heal			0
much of the existing knowledge on prison social systems is gained from settings where facilities are adequately provided , staff numbers are sufficient and properly trained and operational resources are allocated to ensure prisons run smoothly			1
in these settings , it is common practice to try to eliminate gangs due to their inherent problems			0
as such , the popular perception about prison gangs has generally been incomplete			1
despite its many drawbacks , the gang system in @entity27 aids adjustment and survival by lessening the " pains of imprisonment			0
" it also provides inmates with mechanisms to preserve self - identity and self - respect , which , in turn , equips them to re-integrate into the outside community upon release			0
time will tell how the new reformation plans will impact on inmates			0
if they implement an @entity257 model of mass incarceration and eliminate gangs , without dedicating sufficient resources to replace the support structures they provide , prison reform in the @entity16 is bound to fail			1
a better solution would be to continue with a more open prison model , formalize the social structure , target corruption , and , over time , reduce inmate dependency on illicit activities .			1

@entity26 in the @entity16 has around 14,200 inmates , more than twice its *capacity*
gangs dominate prison culture , but their influence is not all bad , authors say
@entity16 is planning to build a new maximum security prison to reduce congestion
authors say modernization will fail if resources are n't allocated to replacing gang services
