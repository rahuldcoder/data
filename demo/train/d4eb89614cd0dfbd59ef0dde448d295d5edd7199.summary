-- stretching out across the peaceful waters of the @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , the @entity5 river crossing is an unlikely record breaker			1
measuring 30 meters in length and made entirely out of waste plastic products , the newly completed structure is the world 's longest and sturdiest recycled bridge			1
utilizing a super-strength composite plastic material -- engineered by researchers at @entity14 from items as common as plastic bottles and household plastic waste -- the bridge caters for pedestrians , cars and heavy goods vehicles			1
the river span is one of five such structures now in existence , although all others are smaller and based in the @entity27 , and can support weights of up to 44 tons			0
according to @entity30 , the @entity31 company behind the project , the bridge is a prototype that has the potential to meet future road and bridge requirements in an eco-friendly manner			1
" there are currently significant bridge and river crossing needs in rural and countryside areas and there will only be more in years going forward , " says @entity38 , ceo of @entity30			2
@entity38 highlights the re-use of obsolete plastics that would otherwise be burned or sent to landfill sites as the primary environmental benefit of the bridge			2
he also adds that recycled composite plastic provides a more sustainable alternative to existing bridge construction materials and not as likely to degrade as steel , timber and concrete			1
" this technology creates enhanced stiffness and strength that is ideal for structures like a bridge , " says @entity38			0
" once the bridge has completed its lifespan , the plastic can then be recycled again and used for other purposes , meaning it will never have to go to landfill , " he adds			1
yet it could be many years before more of us are driving on plastic roads and bridges			0
" the bridge in @entity3 has been built on private land , so it avoids the safety regulations ( which as yet do not account for composite plastics ) of the @entity31 transport department , " says professor @entity69 , head of the @entity70 at @entity71 , which was involved in helping design the structural aspects of the @entity5 project			2
@entity69 believes that overcoming existing legislative hurdles may take time as current building standards have been written around existing materials and do not take into account newly developed ones			0
however the technology has the potential to be used in other areas of construction sector in the meantime			0
such spin - off opportunities have not escaped the attention of @entity30 , who are keen to find new and creative ways to use the plastic technology			0
" we see the potential for the same recycled plastics to be used in road signage , advertising hoardings , as a replacement for plywood on building sites ... and in agriculture , which currently uses a huge amount of timber on the inside of livestock buildings , " says @entity38			2
" these materials generally degrade much more quickly than plastic meaning there is an opportunity to improve efficiencies in a way that spares valuable raw materials and has a positive environmental impact , " he adds .			0

a bridge made entirely out of waste plastic has been built over the @entity2 in @entity4
the structure is the world 's longest and sturdiest recycled bridge
the company behind the *venture* hopes the prototype can meet future bridge building requirements
