since then , two other brutality allegations have been made by men who were allegedly injured by @entity4 police last year , and officer @entity73 has been placed on paid leave in connection with one of those two complaints , a department spokesman said			1
@entity73 , 41 , is a five - year veteran of the @entity4 police , prosecutors said			1
the other four officers involved in the @entity31 incident -- @entity73 , officer @entity81 , sgt. @entity82 and cpl. @entity83 -- were not charged because " the evidence does not show knowing participation in an unlawful act on the part of these officers , " the prosecutor said in a statement			1
@entity31 suffered brain injuries , facial fractures , rib fractures , and extensive bruising and abrasions , the prosecutor 's office said			1
the @entity24 coroner listed the manner of death as a homicide and the cause of death to be " anoxic encephalopathy with acute bronchopneumonia , " asphyxia caused by " mechanical chest compression with blunt cranial - facial injuries during physical altercation with law enforcement , " prosecutors said			0
the toxicology report showed no illegal drugs or alcohol in @entity31 ' system , prosecutors said			1
" the cause of death in this case is mechanical compression of the thorax , making it impossible for @entity31 to breathe normal			2
in other words , with the chest being compressed , @entity31 was unable to inhale , " @entity44 told reporters			2
" over time his brain was deprived of oxygen			0
" @entity20 , who is accused of setting into motion the events that led to @entity31 ' death , made initial contact with @entity31 on july 5 after police received a call about a homeless man looking in car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars , @entity44 said			1
@entity12 , who arrived at the scene later , is accused of using excessive force when he allegedly assaulted and beat @entity31 , " acting recklessly , under the color of authority without lawful necessity , " the prosecutor 's office said			1
@entity12 is accused of using the front end of his taser to hit @entity31 on the head and face eight times while @entity31 was pinned to the ground by other officers and was making no audible sounds , indicating that @entity31 was " down and seriously injured , " the prosecutor 's office said			1
@entity20 made " a deliberate showing of putting on latex gloves " in his detention of @entity31 , @entity44 said			2
@entity20 is accused of making two fists with his gloves still on in front of @entity31 , the prosecutor said			2
" he lifted his fists to @entity31 and he said , ' you see my fist ? now they 're getting to ready to @entity162 you up , ' " @entity44 told reporters , using " f " instead of the full profanity			2
@entity44 said @entity20 ' conduct was unacceptable and " not protecting and serving " the public			0
" @entity20 had to know that he was creating a situation where @entity31 feared for his life and was struggling to get away from an armed officer who was going to ' f ' him up , " @entity44 said			1
the district attorney said he viewed a bus depot surveillance video of the beating			0
the video shows 16 minutes passed from the initial contact by police to the start of the beating and alleged unlawful police conduct , the prosecutor said			2
it 's hard to watch and listen to			0
it 's a person saying he 's sorry , calling for his dad and asking for help			0
he seems to know that it 's over just before it is , " @entity44 said of the video			0
" officer @entity20 had prior contact with @entity31 and he knew @entity31 and who he was			1
he was a homeless drifter who frequented that area , " @entity44 said			0
in all , prosecutors also reviewed video from two cell phones and bus camera videos , statements by 151 witnesses , police reports written by all six officers , the coroner 's report , medical reports , and the batons and @entity204 of the officers , @entity44 said			1
asked about the charged officers ' motive , the prosecutor responded : " that 's a pretty good question			2
it just appears from watching the video that the officer became increasingly angered with @entity31 as this goes on			1
" " @entity20 is accused of instructing @entity31 to put his legs out straight and place his hands on his knees , but @entity31 had difficulty following @entity20 ' instructions , " @entity44 said in his statement			1
" @entity31 appeared to have cognitive issues			2
" the physical altercation began at 8:52 p.m. and lasted nine minutes and 40 seconds until @entity31 was handcuffed and no longer moving , the prosecutor said			2
" throughout the physical altercation , @entity31 struggled , yelled and pleaded , ' i ca n't breathe , ' ' i 'm sorry , dude , ' ' please , ' ' ok , ok , ' ' @entity222 , dad , ' and ' @entity222 , help me			2
' @entity31 was severely bleeding but the officers did not reduce their level of force			1
throughout the struggle , @entity31 ' actions were defensive in nature and motivated by pain and fear , " the prosecutor added in a written summary of the incident			2
@entity12 is accused of kneeing @entity31 twice in the head and using his taser four times on him , including three times as a " drive stun , " or direct application on the skin , for about five seconds each , the prosecutor said			2
the fourth time was a dart deployment , in which two darts connected to wires are ejected and stick to the skin or clothing , for about 12 seconds			0
" @entity31 screamed and yelled in pain while being tased , " the prosecutor 's summary said			1
@entity12 is accused of using the stun device " unreasonably and unnecessarily " because @entity31 was pinned to the ground by several officers and was vulnerable with his head and face exposed , the prosecutors said			1
" the biggest shame about this case is the fact that it could have been avoided , " @entity44 said in his statement			0
" this never had to happen , and it never should have happened			0
" after announcing the charges during a news conference , @entity44 held a private meeting with @entity267 and his attorney			0
after that meeting , @entity267 told reporters that he was " very , very happy " with the outcome of the prosecutors ' investigation			0
" @entity44 made it very clear that this murder charge will not be reduced , " @entity31 told reporters			2
" we came in here expecting the worse and got the best			0
he 's extremely serious about prosecuting to the fullest extent			0
" @entity2 's @entity279 contributed to this report .			0
