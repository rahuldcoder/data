-- a charity that raised close to $ 27 million to help animals worldwide spent nearly all of that money on fund - raising expenses paid to a direct - mail company			1
in addition , @entity0 found that the charity , @entity8 , misrepresented one of its programs called " @entity11 " on its tax filings and hired an officer for that program with a questionable background			1
in 2010 , @entity8 owed $ 8.4 million to @entity16 and its affiliated company , @entity17 , according to publicly available @entity19 990 tax records			1
@entity16 is one of the world 's largest direct - mail providers to charities and nonprofits			0
it is the same fund - raiser hired by two veterans charities that spent tens of millions of dollars for its services -- triggering a @entity29 investigation last month into whether one of the charities should retain its tax - exempt status			1
that charity , @entity34 - based @entity33 , collected nearly $ 56 million in donations over the past three years yet paid @entity16 more than $ 60 million in fees , according to a @entity0 investigation into the charity 's tax records			1
the other veterans charity , @entity41 , raised more than $ 22 million in donations over the past three years to help veterans yet spent about $ 18.2 million to pay @entity16 , according to @entity19 990 forms			1
the animal charity @entity8 is still in debt to @entity16 , according to a spokeswoman for the direct - mail firm , adding that 's part of the charity 's " aggressive strategy " to build a broad donor base			1
" that resulted in an expected high cost in the beginning of their acquisition program , " said the spokeswoman , who declined to be named			0
she called @entity8 's efforts a " successful strategy			2
" business tactics questioned there 's no question that a charity needs to spend money to raise money , according to @entity67 , president of the charity watchdog group @entity68			2
but he said that @entity8 's tax records raise " a number of red flags			1
" " no. 1 , there is an enormous amount of money going into fund - raising , " @entity67 said			1
" it 's not unusual for a nonprofit to fund - raise			1
in fact they need to fund - raise			1
but this organization has an enormous amount of fund - raising costs , certainly relative to the amount of money being spent			1
" of the $ 14 million raised in 2010 , @entity8 reports it spent less than 0.5 % -- about $ 60,000 -- in small cash grants to animal shelters across the @entity88			1
it also said it spent about $ 450,000 -- about 3 % of the total raised in 2010 -- to bring back animals from @entity91 and @entity92 as part of its " @entity11 " program			1
on its website and its tax filings , @entity8 describes " @entity11 " as a program that " helps @entity88 troops safely transport home the companion animals they befriend in the war zone			1
" yet the charity admitted that only 26 of the nearly 500 animals transported to the @entity88 from @entity91 and @entity92 were actually service animals			2
the rest were stray animals , said @entity107 , the charity 's communications director			2
and those 26 service animals were not attached to military k - 9 units but belonged to @entity111 , a private contractor that built roads in @entity91 and @entity92			0
to highlight the work of the " @entity11 " program , spokeswoman @entity113 appeared on @entity0 's sister network , @entity116 , last year with " @entity117 " and " @entity118 , " two former bomb - sniffing dogs she said were abandoned			2
" as the military pulls out and there 's not as great a need to have these dogs , there 's a surplus , " @entity113 told @entity116			0
" these contractors do n't know what to do with them so these are the dogs that are falling through the cracks and they need homes desperately			0
" she said it 's " unthinkable " that the military contractors do not return the dogs back to their countries of origin			0
" and that 's why @entity8 is trying to put a spotlight on this so these dogs are not overlooked , " @entity113 said			0
but a spokesman for @entity143 , the contractor that employed the dogs , told @entity0 that the animals had been given secure new homes out of the war zone in @entity149 and that @entity113 had suddenly shown up " @entity151 " asking to take them to the @entity88			0
when asked about those comments , @entity8 spokeswoman @entity152 told @entity0 the charity had " not heard that from @entity143 before " and said the dogs had been removed from " an uncaring environment in @entity91			2
" questions raised about charity 's management it is not the first time questions have been raised about @entity113 or charities with which she has been involved			0
@entity113 once headed a @entity166 - based animal rescue charity , @entity167 , that reached a settlement agreement in 2007 with the state of @entity166			0
the @entity166 attorney general investigated whether contributions for " rescuing and caring for the animal victims of @entity173 " were used for that purpose			0
in that settlement agreement from the summer of 2007 , @entity113 agreed not to " serve as an officer , director or trustee or in any position having the duties or responsibilities of an officer , director or trustee , with any non-profit organization for a period of five ( 5 ) years from the date of the execution of this @entity189			0
" yet in a filing with the @entity191 secretary of state 's office last year , @entity8 named @entity113 in its list of officers and directors			0
@entity113 did not admit any wrongdoing in the @entity166 settlement , but the charity agreed to return $ 4 million in donations to @entity166 officials out of the $ 8 million raised by @entity167			2
when asked about the settlement agreement , @entity8 's @entity152 said , " we do not believe @entity113 is in violation of her settlement agreement in her capacity working for @entity8			0
" @entity207 , who founded @entity88 - based @entity8 in 2006 , also has a questionable record as a charity manager			2
three years after he founded @entity8 and became its president , @entity207 was fired as the @entity212 's president after leaving the @entity214 charity deeply in debt to @entity16 , according to @entity216 , @entity212 's executive director			2
@entity216 said that the @entity212 still owes @entity16 nearly $ 2 million and that the @entity88 fund - raising company has a lien on the @entity222 organization 's headquarters building			1
@entity207 told @entity0 he is fighting his dismissal and , when asked why he was fired , he responded , " it 's not finished yet so there 's no point in discussing something that still is ongoing			0
" he also defended @entity113 , saying , " she is there under the bullets trying to save dogs and cats and bringing them back to the @entity88 soldiers who befriended them			0
