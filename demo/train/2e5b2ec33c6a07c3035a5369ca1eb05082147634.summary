@entity0 , @entity1 -- the owner of @entity4 is wondering whether the electric wall outlet will be the " gas tank " of the future			1
a @entity9 hybrid , owned by @entity10 , has been converted to run on electricity			1
drivers of gas - sipping hybrid vehicles are increasingly interested in converting their vehicles from gasoline powered to electric , according to garage owner and lead technician @entity18			1
while drivers of conventional gasoline - powered vehicles complain about higher fuel prices , clients of the @entity0 garage are investing big bucks to make their green cars even greener			1
that 's being done through plug - in conversions and adding more powerful batteries to currently available gasoline / electric hybrid cars , such as the @entity9			1
" the regular @entity9 is a gasoline dependent car ; it does n't get energy from anywhere but the gas tank , " said @entity18			1
" what this [ conversion ] allows me to do is get energy through an [ electric wall ] outlet , so [ the wall outlet ] is like my electric gas tank , " she said			2
@entity18 , who has degrees in physics and @entity41 , said she gets three or four calls or e-mails a day , asking about the conversion			0
and , she says , with gas prices at more than $ 4 per gallon , she expects even more interest			0
a lot of the cars that pull in to @entity4 are @entity9 hybrids , which @entity18 calls , " the @entity50 of our times			1
" @entity18 showed off the garage 's psychedelically painted @entity9 , which has undergone the conversion			1
its original nickel - metal - hydride battery packs have been replaced with lead acid batteries to extend the distance the car can travel on electricity			1
@entity18 expects to begin conversions to even more efficient lithium batteries soon			0
the plug - in conversion costs about $ 7,500			1
" gas becomes optional , " with this conversion , @entity18 said			0
" gas is n't required to move this car anymore			0
if you want to drive a really long way , without recharging , yes , gas is required , but it gives you the flexibility of not having to burn gas anymore if you do n't want to			0
and that 's very liberating , " she said			0
the garage itself strives to be green , with much of its power coming from solar panels			2
and with gasoline approaching $ 5 per gallon in the @entity80 , " plugging in cars make a whole lot of sense right at the pocketbook , " said @entity85 , who works for @entity86			2
what kind of people are converting to this conversion ? " we 've seen such a diverse group of people , " said @entity18			0
" we have some people who come in who are entrepreneurs , who are business people , there are some people who are diehard environmentalists , but there are some people who come in , they just want to burn less gas			0
" the corporate folks at @entity9 do n't have any official position on plug - in conversions			1
they do n't endorse or discourage it			0
ireport.com : show us your first car but for hybrid owners who demonstrate exuberant efforts to find more energy efficiency , " we really appreciate the fact that the @entity9 is the vehicle of choice , " said @entity110 , environmental communications manager for @entity9			1
@entity110 said the @entity9 was not designed with any conversion possibilities in mind , but she said the company welcomes any technology that pushes the envelope on plug - in batteries			1
while the nickel metal hydride ( @entity125 ) battery will remain the choice for @entity9 , @entity127 and highlander hybrids , @entity9 is doing some research and development with lithium ion batteries			2
@entity110 said @entity9 will be using lithium ion batteries in some commercial fleets in late 2009 , mostly to learn more about charging behaviors			2
although the current batteries are " durable and reliable , " @entity110 said lithium ion batteries pack more energy into a smaller space			0
much more research is needed , she said , about how hybrid owners would use their vehicles			2
for example , how often and for how long owners would plug in to the electrical grid , or a solar supply			0
also , as more drivers become interested in alternative energy , they will need to learn more about infrastructure			0
for example : will companies , malls or fast - food joints provide charging stations ? will they charge for the charge ? in what other ways will the energy infrastructure have to change ? while the 2004 - 2008 @entity9 is the most popular hybrid conversion , it is also possible on 2005 - 2008 @entity161 and @entity162 hybrids			1
and , as @entity18 says on the @entity168 web site , " any car can become a plug - in hybrid , if you have enough money			1
" and driven customers do n't seem to be letting cost discourage them from the conversion			0
" customers are not coming to me and saying , ' i 'll do this if there is a rebate			0
' people come to me and say , ' i want to do this right away , ' " said @entity18			0
@entity168 will soon open a second location for the growing number of really green hybrid owners			2
" hybrid technology is one thing			0
then there is plug - in hybrid technology , which is the next step , which genuinely removes your dependence on fossil fuel , " said @entity18			1
however , most @entity189 electricity is created from burning fossil fuels -- about 70 percent , according to the @entity189 @entity191 of the @entity192			1
just under 49 percent comes from coal - burning power plants , about 20 percent from natural gas and about 1Â½ percent from burning oil			2
@entity2 's @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 garage converts hybrid vehicles to plug - in electric power
for $ 7,500 , @entity168 converts @entity9 , @entity161 , @entity162 models
how will battery - powered vehicles change the nation 's fuel infrastructure ?
electric cars do n't *pollute* , but much @entity189 electricity comes from fossil fuels
