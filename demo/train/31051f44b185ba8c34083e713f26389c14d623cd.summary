-- a " miracle " journey has propelled @entity3 from war - torn @entity4 to soccer stardom in the @entity7 with @entity8			1
separated from his mother as he fled to @entity12 as a child , they were reunited later in the @entity14			1
and his big break may never have happened had she not sent him on a fateful trip to the shops to buy a pint of milk			0
his errand took him right past the training academy at third division club @entity23 , when he felt compelled to knock on the door and ask for a trial			0
" i heard this small voice inside of me saying ' go and play ' and i thought , ' okay			0
' i obeyed that voice , " @entity3 told @entity0 's human to @entity29			1
" i said a prayer : ' @entity32 , these guys do n't know me , i do n't know them and so everything i say to them just make them say yes -- even if they do n't understand me just make them say yes , yes , yes ! ' " the precocious boy , then aged 10 , tapped youth coach @entity36 on the shoulder and asked if he could play			0
it was a meeting that would change @entity3 's life forever			1
@entity36 promised the kid -- who used to run to school to save paying the modest bus fare -- that he 'd pop along next time he played in a match			0
overjoyed , @entity44 scurried home to tell his family -- but he did n't get far			1
" i was really excited , then i started jogging , not even sprinting , just jogging with happiness , " he explains			0
" as i was jogging up the hill to go back home , they stopped me			0
they called me back and said ' do you have your own equipment ? boots and stuff ? ' i did n't but i said yes and then they said , ' come back tomorrow and start training			0
' " they said they saw me running fast , like an athlete			0
that 's where i believe @entity32 showed them something , like a glimpse of the future -- how i was going to turn out to be			1
" @entity32 's favor has just been amazing -- going there , signing , playing for two years , i got moved up to the age above and everybody started becoming like a family at @entity23			1
until now my life has just been extraordinary , a blessing			0
" when @entity36 moved to join the academy at @entity8 in the northeast of @entity76 , his new employers asked if there were any bright prospects at @entity23 that might interest them			1
although it would take four years to get his man , @entity44 eventually signed with the club -- renowned for stars such as @entity82 and @entity83 -- for Â £ 1 million ( $ 1.6 million ) in july 2012			0
now 19 , he harbors the hopes and dreams of some of most passionate supporters in the country -- known as the @entity8 -- and is watched by billions of football - mad fans across the globe			1
in his first season at the club he featured against @entity7 champions @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and played in @entity8 's @entity98 quarterfinal with @entity100 giants @entity99			1
he has also represented his adopted country at under - 20 level			2
" it 's nothing but a miracle , where i 've come from to be in this place , " he said			2
" if somebody told me two years ago or five years ago that i 'd be here , i 'd say ' you 're crazy			2
' " i believe that this is just a glimpse of what 's going to happen in my life because there 's more to come -- it 's exciting			2
" @entity8 as everyone knows is one of the big clubs in @entity76 and their history speaks for itself			1
the fans are just awesome and crazy , but good crazy			0
it 's a nice place to be -- they 're really supportive and love the club no matter what happens			1
" it 's a blessing to play for this club and i 've heard people say how we used to be in the days of @entity126 and @entity82 , that the stadium was electric			2
i want to experience that feeling			0
i want to be a part of the history of @entity8 in a team that 's done something			1
" the pristine turf at @entity134 is a world away from the dusty streets of @entity4 where @entity44 first cut his footballing teeth			1
sharing the family home with his three siblings and extended family in the capital @entity143 , when @entity44 was n't playing football he was watching it -- @entity146 club @entity145 catching his eye			1
" it 's tough sometimes but as far as i can remember it was good times for me , " he says of his childhood			2
" we did n't have boots or real footballs but we appreciated what we had			0
there was a good spirit , we did n't have a lot but we lived a good life to the maximum			0
" but with the specter of civil war growing , @entity3 's family was about to be displaced as the relationship between the country 's @entity166 and @entity167 tribes fractured violently			1
the aftermath of the first multiparty elections since @entity4 gained independence from @entity172 in 1962 unleashed a wave of recriminations and uprooted thousands of people , with a civil war that lasted from 1993 - 2005			1
" the war was the reason we moved to @entity12 , so we kind of divided , " @entity3 explained			1
" we got separated from my mum for four years but she rang us and she said , ' i 'm in @entity76 and my plan is to bring you guys here			2
' she said the plan is to bring you here to have a good education			0
" as a child ( it was tough ) but it worked out really well			0
it was tough but i just put my trust in @entity32 that he knows what he 's doing and i will see my mum any time , any day			2
" the contrast between downtown @entity193 in @entity12 and a manufacturing city in the heart of @entity76 could not have been greater , but @entity44 took it in his stride			0
" i came to @entity76 and i do n't know how to explain it , it was just cool , " he said			0
" every @entity202 kid , their dream is to come to @entity203 or @entity204 -- in their head that 's paradise			2
" to get here , it 's like everything will get sorted and you never get hungry			2
in my head i thought , ' wow , i 'm going to @entity203 , i 'm going to play with white kids and i 'm going to play football with a different lifestyle , ' so it was very exciting			2
" the reason i play football now is for my friends back in @entity202 and for all of the kids who were in my position when i was in @entity202 or who never thought i 'd play in the @entity7			1
yes i do miss them but i know that one day i will see them			0
" so what advice would the teenager offer to any youngster back in @entity4 who dreams of becoming the next @entity3 ? " never give up and never quit on yourself , " he said			1
" i believe everyone is here for a reason , even though sometimes we might not see it , but everyone here has got a plan to play , has got a place to play in this life			0
" i always say to people , if they know a jigsaw game , every piece is important and every person in the world is just like a piece of jigsaw , we all have a place to be to feel free in our lives			0
you 're special and you 're here for a reason			1
