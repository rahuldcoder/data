-- affectionately known in his home city of @entity3 as " the wise man of @entity5 , " @entity1 left the legacy of helping @entity8 's ascension to the top of world football			1
@entity1 , whose death at the age of 75 was announced saturday , coached his national side to the @entity15 title in 2008 -- the country 's first success at a major tournament in more than 40 years			1
that breakthrough was continued by his successor @entity20 , who continued with the " tiki taka " passing style @entity1 introduced , as " @entity8 " won the @entity22 and the 2012 @entity24 crown			1
" without a doubt , he marked the road in this final successful phase			0
i felt a great deal of appreciation towards him , " @entity20 told the national team 's official website			1
" i knew he had some health problems , but i never imagined it would lead to this			0
" " always with us , @entity1 , " led the website tribute of @entity3 , the club where @entity1 played for a decade between 1964 - 74 and was head coach on four occasions , most recently 2001 - 03			1
he guided @entity3 to the @entity42 title in 1977 and the @entity43 on three occasions			2
" @entity1 was a great player and coach , but before all that a great person and a friend , " said the team 's president @entity46			1
" first and foremost he was @entity3			2
we want to express on behalf of the whole club our condolences to his family			0
" @entity1 ' final coaching job was with @entity57 side @entity56 , which ended in mid- 2009 , and late last year he announced his retirement from the game -- in which he started out at @entity61 in 1957			1
he was reportedly taken to a @entity3 hospital last week with a serious illness , from which he did not recover			2
@entity1 will be buried at a private ceremony on sunday			0
@entity3 will observe a minute 's silence ahead of the home match against @entity67 , in which the team will seek to go top of the table above another of his former teams , @entity72			1
" i wish to express our sorrow at the loss of one of football 's greatest men and one of the most charismatic and likeable managers we remember , " @entity72 president @entity74 said before his side 's 3 - 2 defeat by @entity77 -- its first at home in the league since april 2012			2
" as a club , we had the honor of his services , albeit for a very short time , in the 1987 - 88 season , when we won the @entity43			0
" we much appreciate his respect for @entity72 , its model and our players			0
@entity94 2008 , with @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and so many others , is a great example			0
" @entity101 ' appreciation of @entity72 's " tiki taka " style -- started by @entity103 and developed by @entity104 -- was borne out by the number of the players from the @entity108 club he selected for the national team			1
but his heart lay in the nation 's capital , where he was on the books of @entity3 's big rival @entity116 from 1958 - 60 as a player -- though he spent most of that time out on loan to other clubs			2
" the loss of @entity1 saddens all of us who love football , " said @entity67 president @entity121			2
" today is a day of mourning for this sport , but it should also be a day of recognition for a legendary figure who was vital in giving us a glorious period with our @entity134 national team			0
" he ennobled this sport and all @entity134 fans owe him gratitude and respect			0
his personal and professional career was always characterized by honesty and hard work			0
" the only blot on his international career was an incident in 2004 , when he was accused of making a racial comment -- which was caught on television cameras -- about @entity148 striker @entity147 while he was trying to motivate his players in training ahead of a @entity151 qualifying match			0
@entity1 was fined by @entity24 football 's ruling body @entity152 and subsequently apologized to @entity147 , insisting he had not intended to make a racial insult .			1
