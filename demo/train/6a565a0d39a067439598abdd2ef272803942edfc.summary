-- day six of the @entity1 at @entity2 and the shocks just keep on coming in the women 's draw			1
reigning @entity7 champion @entity6 is the latest casualty after crashing out in the third round to @entity10 , a player ranked 145 in the world			1
the @entity14 qualifier made light work of the heavy - hitting opponent from the @entity17 winning in straight sets 6 - 4 6 - 4 in one hour 34 minutes			1
to say that @entity6 was off her game is an understatement as she lost serve five times and racked up 34 unforced errors			0
but rather than focus on the shortcomings in her own game on saturday , @entity6 chose to praise her opponent			0
" i think she played really unbelievable tennis , and she put a lot of balls back , " @entity6 said			0
" i did mistakes , and i was really trying everything that i could in that moment			0
i was trying to fight and fighting every point , but it was so difficult			0
it was n't really my day			0
she played really great tennis today			0
" by her standards , @entity6 has a poor record at the @entity1 having never got further than the fourth round			0
but the 24 - year - old had reason to hope that this year might be different after claiming a second @entity7 title in july and her win at the @entity46 tournament last week			1
but her dreams have been extinguished for another 12 months as she becomes the fifth top 10 seed to depart the women 's tournament			1
@entity6 joins second seed @entity51 , fourth seed @entity52 , sixth seed @entity54 and @entity56 , the eight seed -- all of whom have already packed their bags			2
for @entity10 , who will now play @entity63 @entity62 in the fourth round , it was a victory to savor			2
" it was an honor for me to be in the same court with @entity66			0
of course , i did n't expect to win			0
of course , i was hoping at least to win a set , but i managed to win a match somehow			0
" @entity62 , seeded 16 at @entity2 this year , eased through to the last 16 with a 6 - 1 6 - 1 win over @entity71 's @entity70			2
reigning champion @entity72 is also safely through to the second week following a 6 - 3 6 - 3 win over @entity74 while 11th - seed @entity75 from @entity76 will face @entity78 's @entity77 for a place in the quarterfinals			1
@entity75 saw off @entity81 of the @entity82 in straight sets 6 - 4 6 - 0 , while @entity77 , the 29th seed , needed three sets to get past @entity86 , winning 6 - 3 3 - 6 6 - 4 in one hour 54 minutes			1
in the men 's competition , the top seeds are faring better			1
champion of two years ago @entity90 , seeded eighth this year , progressed to the fourth round with a four - set win over @entity71 's @entity93 6 - 1 7 - 5 4 - 6 6 - 2			1
" i got off to a good start , then had a bit of a cushion when he started to get back in the match , " @entity90 said			2
" i just tried to stay solid in the fourth set and thankfully it paid off			0
" the 27 - year - old @entity102 's reward is a match up against @entity104			0
the @entity106 ninth seed beat @entity108 's @entity107 in straight sets 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 4			1
world no. 1 @entity109 did n't break sweat against @entity112 , beating his @entity82 opponent 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 2 to set up last 16 tie against either @entity115 or @entity82 13th seed @entity116			1
earlier on saturday , @entity117 won in straight sets against @entity119 of the @entity120			1
the number five seed from @entity122 will now play 10th seed @entity123 in the last 16			2
the @entity126 no. 1 beat @entity128 's @entity127 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 3 .			2
