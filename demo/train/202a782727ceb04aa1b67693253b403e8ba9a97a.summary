-- every spring , a yellow blanket of pollen descends upon @entity3 , eliciting complaints from allergy sufferers already fed up with watery eyes , stuffed - up sinuses and excessive sneezing			1
if you 're wondering exactly what that is covering your car , it 's pine pollen , which usually comes out in mid- to late - april			1
but believe it or not , it 's probably not what 's causing your symptoms			0

instead , it 's microscopic particles in the spring air that are hell - bent on causing misery			0
most seasonal allergies are caused by smaller tree pollen and mold spores , according to the @entity29			2
more than 60 million @entity3 suffer from allergic rhinitis , according to the academy			1
that means when they inhale something they are allergic to , they suffer symptoms in the nose and eyes			2
when the trigger of the reaction is pollen , the person is said to have " hay fever			2
" warm , dry climates have the highest pollen levels , according to @entity45 , while rainy or cool weather significantly reduces allergens in the air			1
do n't let allergies stop you from traveling fortunately for allergy sufferers , 2013 has so far been relatively mild compared to last year , when an unusually warm winter caused the season to start earlier and last longer			1

worst @entity3 cities for allergy sufferers a pollen count signifies how much pollen is in the air			1

" the sample is then examined under a microscope , where the pollen grains are counted and identified			2
" the device must be placed on a rooftop at least one story high , away from any significant pollen or mold sources , @entity91 states , to get an accurate reading			0
the numbers used to quantify pollen levels vary between collecting stations , and do n't mean much to the average consumer , so levels are usually described simply as low , moderate or high			1
what constitutes a high pollen count also depends on what type of allergen is being tracked , according to @entity107			0
where do allergies come from ? treating the symptoms you 've got three options for over-the - counter oral antihistamines : @entity114 ( fexofenadine ) , @entity116 ( loratadine ) and @entity118 ( cetirizine ) , but many patients need a prescription nasal spray in addition to one of those in order to find relief			0
allergists can prescribe topical nasal antihistamines and steroidal sprays			0
antihistamine eye drops are also available over-the - counter and by prescription			0
the only long - term option for allergy sufferers is to undergo immune therapy , in the form of shots , over three to five years			0
