-- @entity1 , an @entity2 - trained mechanical engineer , wants to find out how things work -- even when they 're inside his throat			1
a two - time @entity6 pole - vaulter , former host of a @entity9 show , entrepreneur and co-founder of a company -- @entity13 , which creates powered rope ascenders -- ball is also a beatboxer			2
he manipulates his voice to make deep , baritone sounds and robotic noises			2
he fluctuates from quick staccato beats and deep bass to buzzes and record - scratching sounds			2
" beatboxing is one of the most natural things i can imagine a person doing , " he said			2
" we 're rhythmic beings through and through			2
we walk in rhythm , our hearts beat in rhythm			0
" ball 's philosophy is that human bodies are " incredible machines capable of amazing beauty			1
... the possibilities are endless , " he said at @entity38 , a conference about great ideas in health care in october			1
" when i 'm beatboxing , it 's fun to add elements : scratching like a record , there 's beats , talking while you 're doing a beat -- which is not easy to do on the fly , " he said			0
" that 's what beatboxing is all about			0
it 's about putting together all the crazy noises you can possibly manage and making it sound cool			0
" other than being fun , @entity1 wondered : how does it all work ? to figure out what 's happening inside his brain , he went inside an @entity63 , an imaging machine that can show brain activity through blood flow			1
when he performed a beat from memory , his brain activity was different from when he improvised			0
when he created a beat on the fly , the brain activity in the prefrontal cortex , which is involved in self - monitoring , shut down			0
but other networks in his brain activated , including the cerebellum , which handles motor coordination , and and the temporal lobe , which is involved in auditory perception and emotional response			0
but @entity1 wanted to find out more -- what 's happening inside his throat to form those sounds ? to get a closer look , he had a fiber optic camera lowered through his nose to investigate at @entity38			1
this was n't his first time getting a laryngoscopy			0
with the camera inside his body and an image projected onto the big screen , @entity1 continued to beatbox			1
the camera showed it was n't only the vocal cords that help to create sounds			0
" making the robot voice , i thought my vocal cords were vibrating , flapping at a low frequency , " @entity1 said			1
when he growled or let out a deep hum , his arytenoid cartilage and other tissues nearby his vocal cords also vibrated			0
" it 's fascinating and captivating and gross , " he said			0
the video is not for the squeamish , since you can see lots of human tissue and saliva			1
but it shows how the human body works			1
" it 's this thrilling edge of discovery , " he said -- even when it 's inside your own body .			1

@entity1 wanted to see how his body is able to beatbox
at @entity38 , he had a laryngoscope lowered into his larynx
@entity1 said human bodies are incredible machines with endless possibilities
