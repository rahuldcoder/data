@entity0 -- the exchange of name cards has long been a ubiquitous part of meeting new people in @entity6			2
but now it 's increasingly likely to be accompanied by the frenzied flourishing of smartphones , as the participants add one another on @entity12 , the phenomenally popular instant - messaging app made by the country 's biggest internet company , @entity14			1
while name cards have yet to be completely supplanted , many now also have a qr code which , when scanned into a mobile phone , adds the card 's bearer as a @entity12 contact			2
the popular function is one reason behind the rise of @entity12 -- called @entity12 in @entity6 -- which is unseating the @entity27 - like microblogging platform @entity26 as @entity6 's dominant social media			1
once a lively forum for public debate that for a time wrong - footed @entity6 censors , users are ditching @entity26 as tightened government oversight takes its toll			1
@entity12 's greater privacy and wider range of applications make it more attractive to users			1
abandoning @entity26 @entity39 , a 26 - year - old project manager in @entity0 , started using @entity12 when she upgraded to an @entity40 last may			1
by that time , most of her friends were already using the service , although she still preferred @entity26			0
that changed in november , when she caught the bouquet at a friend 's wedding , and posted pictures of the event on her @entity12 activity timeline which , like @entity51 , allows users to share photos and status updates with their contacts			1
" there were instant comments from my friends			0
i realized that @entity12 was a better , more effective social networking tool than @entity26 , which has been practically abandoned by most people			1
" the rise of @entity12 @entity12 was launched in early 2011 , attracting 100 million registered users in its first 15 months			1
this was in part due to @entity14 's ability to promote the app to its huge base of over 800 million users of its many other services , including @entity71 , its desktop instant messaging client			1
@entity14 has also been quick in rolling out new versions of the app , adding features such as mobile payment , e-commerce integration , games , marketing accounts for brands , a taxi - hailing function and an online investment fund			0
many were quick to gain traction in the day - to - day lives of users			0
a function that allowed people to give and receive digital versions of @entity90 red envelopes saw 20 million exchanged			0
as of last september , when @entity14 's most recent figures were released , @entity12 had 271.9 million active monthly users , up 124 % from the previous year			1
dodging state censorship there are growing indications that @entity26 , once a hotbed of public discussion , from celebrity scandals to holding corrupt officials to account , is losing its appeal			1
the collision of two high - speed trains near the @entity103 city of @entity104 in 2011 was a watershed moment , seeing harried @entity107 censors play whack - a - mole with comments by @entity26 users , who were critical of the government 's handling of the aftermath			1
over the next year , the government tightened its grip			0
measures included requiring that accounts be registered under real names , and that those posting " rumors " be suspended			0
according to a report by researchers at @entity123 commissioned by the @entity126 's @entity125 newspaper , a significant drop in active usage came after venture capitalist and high - profile @entity26 user @entity120 was arrested for soliciting prostitutes			2
he was paraded on state television , and confessed to spreading irresponsible messages online			0
in addition , a report by the @entity134 backs the findings of @entity123 , claiming the number of microblog users , which includes @entity26 and similar services , dropped by over 27.8 million last year			2
according to @entity142 's latest figures , @entity26 's daily active users are still growing , albeit slowly , with a 4.2 % rise in the fourth quarter			1
the company says third - party claims of a drop in active users are flawed , and chairman and ceo , @entity145 said during a recent earnings call that the average time users spent on @entity26 did not change over the third quarter of 2013			2
@entity142 seems to be pushing ahead with the long - awaited spin - off and ipo of @entity26 , with reports that it recently enlisted @entity159 and @entity160 to underwrite an offering of up to $ 500 million in @entity162 sometime in the second quarter for a share of up to 25 %			0
will one replace the other ? the greater control @entity12 offers over information sharing looks like one of the factors that makes it appeal more to users			1
posts made to @entity26 are public , and therefore can go viral in a very short time , while posts made to @entity12 timelines are shared only with contacts , and there is no easy way to forward them			2
@entity178 , digital strategist and co-founder of @entity181 , a technology and entrepreneurship community in @entity0 , says this means the two platforms are not necessarily mutually exclusive , although a change does seem to be underway			1
" much like @entity51 versus @entity27 , there seem to be more than enough dual users , or at least people with both apps on their phones			0
( but ) monthly active users have certainly shifted			0
i know my @entity26 app has gotten dusty , " says @entity178			0
this shift is palpable when speaking to @entity6 social media users			2
" it is very obvious that fewer people are using @entity26 , because i get less feedback when i tweet and retweet , " says @entity196 , a 29 - year - old media professional			0
" wechat status updates are private , so my friends and i prefer to post things about our daily lives there			0
i have to check @entity12 every day to make sure i do n't miss important things			2
" going global as @entity51 announces its $ 19 billion acquisition of @entity12 competitor @entity210 , the the question of @entity12 's potential for international expansion has come to the fore			2
@entity14 still faces huge challenges in going global			0
its functionality could be appealing to users but questions remain over what marketing approach the company will take for a product that already boasts a 100 million - strong user base abroad			0
" this will be new for @entity14 and very expensive , " says @entity178			0
" it will be interesting to see how hard @entity14 is willing to spend to win new users outside of @entity6 , and if they can scale up all its advanced features such as mobile commerce and banking to other markets			1

@entity14 's @entity12 , also known as @entity12 , is on the rise
microblogging site @entity26 seems to be losing its appeal in @entity6 amid greater state controls
users say @entity12 offers greater privacy and variety of applications than @entity26
but the two platforms are n't necessarily mutually exclusive , say *analysts*
