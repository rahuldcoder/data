-- this week , veteran @entity3 marketer @entity1 learned the hard way that you should watch your words -- especially when you put them in writing -- after a nasty digital lecture she delivered to a young job seeker went viral			1
in her sarcasm - laden message to recent graduate @entity12 , who 'd asked to connect with @entity1 via @entity13 , @entity1 wrote : " your invitation to connect is inappropriate , beneficial only to you , and tacky			2
wow , i can not wait to let every 26 - year - old jobseeker mine my top - tier marketing connections to help them land a job			1
... you 're welcome for your humility lesson for the year			2
" it was hardly a lesson learned			2
@entity12 countered by posting @entity1 's response online asking people on @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 to " please call this lady out			1
" she then forwarded @entity1 's message to a local radio station and appeared on air to discuss			2
@entity1 's words were , of course , undeniably , and likely unnecessarily , harsh , especially considering @entity1 has made her name as an advocate for @entity3 jobseekers , creating and updating a popular local jobs bank with some 7,300 subscribers			2
last year , in fact , she was named the city 's " @entity40			2
" it 's a time when many women struggle to find mentors			1
in a 2011 survey of more than 1,000 working women , one out of five said they 've never had a mentor at work			1
and the " queen bee syndrome " is alive and well			0
@entity1 might have aimed to correct what she considered @entity12 's breach of protocol with kindness rather than condescension and cruelty			0
instead , she seemed to take glee in putting @entity57 in her place			0
" i love the sense of entitlement in your generation , " she wrote			0
" and i therefore enjoy denying your invite			0
" she ended the note with " do n't ever write me again			0
" certainly , it 's hard not to wonder why @entity1 -- a professional in a field where image matters , a lot , and an avid social marketer besides -- did n't anticipate the possibility that @entity12 might share the note with others , although it turns out this was not the first time @entity1 had delivered such an admonishment			1
but she 's hardly the only one at fault here			0
by herself choosing not to ignore @entity1 's words , and instead shame her for them in a most public manner , @entity12 acted with malice , and caused the older woman significant damage			0
@entity1 has since been the subject of national outrage ; many have suggested that her career is dead			0
in the wake of the exchange , she issued a public apology and has deleted most of the contents of her blog and shut down her social media accounts , including the @entity94 twitter that served to help thousands of people find work			1
no question , @entity1 lashed out first , with unprofessional behavior that can only be described as bullying			1
an undoubtedly kinder , and wiser , alternative , of course , might have been to simply ignore @entity12 's request			0
but @entity12 responding in kind makes her no less a bully			0
perhaps it 's not surprising : bullying is wont to breed more bullying			1
and social media provides the opportunity to make anything public with ease and efficacy -- a ready and willing vehicle for public shaming			1
but just because you can does n't mean you should			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity118 .			1

job seeker posts sarcastic , mean reply from marketer and it goes viral
@entity118 : marketer was wrong but young jobseeker was wrong to post it
@entity118 : young women need mentors , and marketer *failed* to help her
@entity118 : posting on social media to humiliate someone is a form of bullying
