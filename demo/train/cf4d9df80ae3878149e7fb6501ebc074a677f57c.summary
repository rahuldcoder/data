hundreds of contraband cell phones were found behind bars or in transit to @entity5 inmates in 2008			1

" these are not stupid people , " he said of the coordinated efforts to slip phones into the prison and hide them			2
" there are a lot of hands in between and they all want a piece of the action			0
" accomplices on the outside vary from family members , to friends to fellow criminals who buy or steal the phones and charge them with minutes			2
the contraband is then moved through an elaborate series of drop points and usually ferried into the walls of a prison by a guard or trustee -- an escape engineered in reverse			2
