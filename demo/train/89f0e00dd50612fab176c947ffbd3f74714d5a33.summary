-- @entity1 makes sculptures that refuse to stay still			1
his mammoth - sized , stainless steel kinetic sculptures twist , turn and transform their shape in ways that can call to mind anything from a giant squid to electrons buzzing around an atom 's nucleus			1
the 59 - year - old @entity14 - born artist says inspiration for the otherworldly monuments can come from almost anywhere : " from low - tech sci - fi paraphernalia to microbiological or astronomical models			1
" " growing up , i was fortunate to have spent a lot of time in the ocean , in the water , " he says			0
" my father traveled a lot , we lived in eight different cities in the @entity27 , so i was exposed to all kinds of things , besides books and whatnot			0
" since 1994 , the artist made his home on 10 acres of @entity34 , @entity35 , which now incorporate @entity1 's gallery and sculpture park			2
his new creation -- a 17 ft - tall spike with a rotating ring of steel arms ( below ) -- has just taken pride of place on the lawn , and you can watch it in action in the new video here			2
@entity1 has been making kinetic sculptures since 1990			1
after graduating art school , he spent five years in a house he built on a remote mountaintop in @entity51			0
it was there that he painted water colors of the landscape , but eventually grew bored			0
he got a job as a superintendent in a warehouse and moved to @entity59			0
" my job was mostly putting up steel shelving , so i was surrounded by steel			0
my painting continued to go nowhere and i realized that i had a lot of raw material in the steel shelving			0
" " i also lived on the top of a roof , with lots of outdoor space , and had the idea of making things that spun in the wind -- and the rest is history , so they say			1
" today , the ( now extremely complex ) sculptures begin life on a computer , where @entity1 makes a digital " sketch " in modeling software packages 3ds @entity82 and @entity83			1
each component can be sent from the computer to a laser cutter which precisely carves out the curvilinear form			2
but there is still room for ideas to develop and change , he notes , as he finishes the components by hand , using traditional metalworking techniques			0
he says the " harmony " between the many different components is created by getting " a very , very good balance " -- with each component carefully set on its axis to ensure it will be equally affected by the force of the wind			1
in addition to the organic forms of underwater and plant life , @entity1 points to the illustrated books of 19th century author @entity107 as early inspiration			1
@entity107 dreamed of nature - inspired helicopters and submarines -- before they were created in real life -- in adventure classics such as " @entity115 " and " twenty thousand leagues under the sea			2
" like these creations , @entity1 's works transform the organic movement of the natural world into cold steel -- yet they retain their own hypnotic mystery			1
" i 'm just making a lot of choices based on what looks right to me , " he says simply			0
for @entity1 , knowing that others are beguiled by his works his creations is a source of happiness : " i definitely set out a long time ago to make these sculptures so that they would be pleasant and hopefully transport a person to a better place than they were before they saw it			2
" " i know that that 's the antithesis of what a lot of people want art to do , but i do n't really care anymore			0
at this point , i 'm very glad that people enjoy looking at them			0
