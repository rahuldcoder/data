-- international investors looking to tap into @entity5 's economy should not be deterred by its political problems , the country 's finance minister has said			1
@entity7 , who 's been trying to steer @entity5 onto a path of economic stability -- a task he 's described in the past as the most difficult job in the world -- has been on a mission to drum up foreign investment to help boost the country 's fragile economy			1
speaking to @entity0 's @entity18 , @entity7 said there 's no doubt his country " needs to get its politics right , which is why an election is inevitable in @entity5			1
" he stressed , however , that the country 's doors are still open to foreign investments , urging the international community to engage more with @entity5			1
" what is also undisputable is that despite the political , it is still a place where one can actually invest and can actually get good returns , " @entity7 said			1
two years ago , a coalition government was formed between @entity7 's party , the @entity34 , and president @entity36 's @entity35			2
there were hopes that the stabilization brought about by the political agreement would see new foreign investment in the country			2
but political uncertainty and lack of clarity in financial policies still represent major concerns for foreign businesses			0
@entity5 's @entity49 , which was passed by a @entity35 - controlled parliament last year , requires foreign businesses to submit plans within five years for transferring 51 % of their investments to black @entity5			1
but @entity7 says the law does n't mean expropriation of foreign companies			2
" there 's a lot of mistrust in the @entity5 economy , but mistrust comes out of ignorance , " he says			2
" you have to understand what you are dealing with and a lot of people do n't understand what they 're dealing with , because there 's a lot of negativity that has jumped out on the internet and in the newspapers			0
" @entity7 , who inherited an economy battered by record hyperinflation and 90 % unemployment , says he does n't underestimate the political difficulties that still exist in the country and the uncertainty over the power - sharing agreement			1
" i 'm not sweeping it under the carpet , which is why we need a new constitution , which is why we need the rule of law , which is why we need respect for each other , including respect for property rights , " he says			0
last year , @entity7 's efforts to improve @entity5 's economy seemed to be given a boost when the country was allowed to sell diamonds from the @entity96 diamond fields , 66,000 hectares of land near @entity5 's border with @entity99			1
overall , @entity5 says it has a stockpile of @entity96 diamonds estimated to be worth about $ 1.7 billion			0
but according to @entity7 , the precious stones have not yet proven to be the " @entity103 that many people thought , " contributing only $ 35 million to the country 's coffers last year			1
" part of the problem lies in the illegal smuggling that we think is still happening , and part of the problem lies in the fact that we need the @entity120 stamp of approval , " says @entity7 , referring to the group which monitors trade in the precious stones to stop the use of blood diamonds to fuel conflicts			0
@entity5 's harvest of diamonds in the @entity96 district has sparked controversy in recent years after accusations by groups such as @entity128 and @entity129 that military - run syndicates were funneling money from the diamond fields to @entity36 's party			2
but @entity7 says he has no evidence of that			0
" what i can tell you is that this is such a fungible mineral found over a huge space of land , close to a very long border in a very inaccessible mountainous region , so anyone and anybody can smuggle , " he says			0
he adds , however , that there should be action to tackle the problem			0
" we are not the first country to discover diamonds , which is why we want to be part of the @entity120 certification scheme , " he says			0
" we believe we can comply , we believe we can operate consistent within the international standards			0

@entity7 has been leading @entity5 's efforts to stabilize its economy
he says investors can make good returns despite the country 's political problems
according to the finance minister , an election in inevitable in @entity5
