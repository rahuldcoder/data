" at this point it 's a reputation crisis but is not specific to the job they are doing , " says dr. @entity44 , a specialist in crisis management at the @entity46			2
" the reason @entity1 is still growing is that people still view them as a good service			1
if there was a problem with the rides we would see a much more immediate effect			0
" @entity44 compares the situation with @entity62 's plummeting stock in the wake of the @entity65 spill -- " a material crisis , related to their primary function " -- that is still depressing the company 's performance several years later			0
