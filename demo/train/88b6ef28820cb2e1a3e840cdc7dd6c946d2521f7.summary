-- we have met the enemy , and he is us			0
debate on health care reform has once again become a miserable exhibition of seemingly irreconcilable differences , which president @entity7 is trying to address in his health care summit			2
there is a path forward , and it starts with understanding that waiting for the government to lead an uncertain reform effort is n't necessary			0
prepaid integrated health systems like @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are succeeding and innovative			1
it 's no coincidence that these organizations are often mentioned when describing health care providers that offer high quality care while staying affordable			1
legislators should encourage such proven successes and make them available to all @entity25			0
integrated health systems simply assume responsibility for both the financing and delivery of care , so they try to keep patients healthy and avoid costlier illnesses and hospitalizations down the road			1
they are more likely to provide preventative care , such as vaccinations and cancer screening			0
basically , the system we are all accustomed to in the @entity25 separates insurance from the provision of care			0
that is , your doctor and hospital and your health insurance company are different institutions			0
this pits them against one another , because one wants to cut care whenever possible , while the other wants to provide as much care as possible , with little incentive to keep costs down			0
integrated systems are simply both -- they are either insurance companies who own their own hospitals and hire their own doctors or hospital and physician groups that offer a health plan			2
other innovations routinely seen in integrated systems include digital medical records , direct electronic messaging with providers , instant access to health records and test results , telehealth and home - based medical services and affordable access to primary care			1
many people are determined that the @entity25 should emulate the rest of the industrialized world and adopt a publicly subsidized system of universal coverage			0
admirers of these foreign systems point to their low costs and accessible primary care services , but they may be surprised to find that successful integrated health systems in this country are organized very similarly to the most admired state - sponsored systems found overseas			1
whether taxpayers help fund an institution is not the main factor for success ; rather , it is the integration between delivery and payment that creates an incentive to provide high - value care that keeps members healthy and out of hospitals			1
this is the mantra that guides care delivery in both the best - performing systems overseas and in prepaid integrated systems in the @entity25			2
meanwhile , there are , of course , publicly supported health programs in the @entity25 , including @entity110			0
yet the same people who lament that a state - subsidized health care system would lay an unrelenting path to outright socialism hardly ever call for a dismantling of @entity110			1
whether that 's because of political expediency or simple hypocrisy can be left to conjecture			0
what 's important is that a high - performing , state - sponsored health institution already operates in the @entity25 -- the @entity122			1
unlike @entity110 and @entity124 , however , the @entity123 has a tightly integrated health care system that has managed to dramatically improve quality and introduce innovations , all while keeping costs in check			1
killing off all state - sponsorship of health care in this country in a shortsighted resistance against progressivism would be a grave mistake			1
the bottom line is that we 've been arguing over the wrong question			0
the best health care system is n't a matter of private vs. public , or us vs. them			1
the debate should be about how to foster a system that is organized in a way such that its utmost concern is providing value to its patients			2
there is no need to import a foreign system ; we already have many similar systems in existence			0
the biggest hurdle is that , despite their advantages , integrated systems only serve about 5 percent of the population			0
entrenched players in the health care industry stand opposed to integrated care			2
if legislators truly want to make health care better , they will encourage the development of more integrated systems so that everyone has access to multiple options in a competitive marketplace			1
maintaining a vibrant , innovative private sector is critical , but we also ca n't ignore the success of many integrated , publicly subsidized systems abroad			2
fostering the growth of our own integrated health systems in the private sector addresses the right question and offers the opportunity for us to have the best system of all			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			0

@entity180 touts integrated health systems , which handle finances and care
@entity180 : they have incentive to keep patients healthy and avoid costly illnesses
he *writes* that the best health care is n't a matter of private vs. public , but how it 's organized
@entity180 says @entity123 has a tightly integrated , high - quality health care system
