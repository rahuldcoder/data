-- two former presidents reflected on their greatest regrets in office monday , each looking back to issues that continue to plague the nation years later			1
former presidents and political rivals @entity9 and @entity10 now share philanthropic efforts			1
former presidents @entity10 and @entity9 appeared together at a question - and - answer forum before the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
asked his biggest regret after leaving office , @entity10 said he now wonders whether he should have tried to get @entity19 to leave office at the end of the first @entity22 in 1991			1
he told the gathering , " i 've thought a lot about it , but at the end of @entity22 , the question was should we have kind of kept going on that road to death and all this slaughter until @entity19 showed up and laid his sword on the table , surrendered			2
and the common wisdom was he would n't do that			0
" but he said a conversation with an @entity39 agent who interrogated @entity19 after he was captured has made him reconsider			0
@entity10 recalled their talk , " i said , ' what if we just say he has to come to surrender , would he have done it ? ' and this guy said , ' i 'm absolutely convinced he would have			1
' my experts tell me he would n't have			0
" @entity10 said , " we ended it the way we said we would " as a military success , but noted a cleaner ending " would have been perfect			0
" he added , " if we had tried to get @entity19 to come and literally surrender and put his sword on the table , i think it might have been avoided some of the problems that we did have in the future from him			2
" on a day that president @entity60 dispatched @entity61 to the @entity62 as the latest @entity64 envoy , @entity9 discussed the failure to achieve peace between @entity67 and @entity68			1
" my no. 1 regret is that i was not able to persuade @entity70 to accept the peace plan i offered at the end of my presidency that the @entity67 accepted			2
" if he had done that ... we had had seven years of progress toward peace			0
we had one year in 1998 , the only year in the history of @entity67 where not a single soul was killed in a terrorist act			0
the @entity68 had more control over @entity80 then than they do today , " @entity9 said			1
" and if he had taken that deal , we would have a @entity68 state and we would have had , i think now , normal peaceful relations with @entity67 and all of its @entity85 neighbors			1
" @entity9 said a deal would have helped the @entity64 handle other issues in the region , saying , " we 'd be much better positioned to deal with the problem of @entity90 , and we would have taken away about half the arguments of terrorists around the world by giving the @entity68 their state and creating a cooperative , positive interdependence in the @entity62 , not a negative one			1
and so , i think that would have done more good to save more lives and help more people , and i wish i had been able to do that			0
" @entity9 also said he regretted not doing more to " stop the @entity102 genocide , " and succeeding on a new health care plan			0
he said " presidents should share freely ... the mistakes they made " with historians , because it teaches lessons			2
he said he shared problems during the lunch with @entity60 and the four living presidents , saying , " you want each new president to make new mistakes , not the same ones			0
" @entity9 added , " all of us know if you make enough decisions , you 're going to make a few of them are n't right			0

@entity62 leaves @entity10 and @entity9 with some regrets
@entity10 wonders whether he should have pressed harder for @entity19 *'s* surrender
@entity9 looks back at @entity68 - @entity67 peace process with some *remorse*
presidents should share their mistakes as a learning tool , @entity9 says
