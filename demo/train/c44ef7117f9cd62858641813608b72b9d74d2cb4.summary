@entity0 -- a new report by the @entity3 has found " challenges " in securing thousands of pieces of radiological equipment spread throughout the @entity7 that could become parts of a deadly " dirty bomb			1
" the materials , used in the oil , gas , aerospace , and food sterilization industries , can include everything from portable cameras that scan pipe welds to large research equipment			0
" in the hands of terrorists , these sources could be used to produce a simple and crude , but potentially dangerous weapon , known as a radiological dispersal device or dirty bomb , " @entity19 , the @entity3 's director of natural resources and environment , wrote in the report			2
there are 4,162 containers of industrial radiological material spread among 498 licensees in the @entity7 , according to the @entity33			0
the material can be as small as a grain of rice or rods that are several inches long			0
to evaluate security , investigators visited 33 industrial sites that use radiological sources in @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 over the last two years			1
an open door and fences that did not go all the way to the ceiling were found at one location			2
" the @entity33 inspector told us that the licensee was in compliance with @entity33 's security controls because the sources were secured through other measures -- such as locks and a motion detector , " @entity19 wrote in the report			2
" the inspector told us that while the security measures in place were not optimal , there were no apparent security violations			0
" unsecured skylights were found at nine of the 33 sites visited , but the @entity33 inspector told the @entity3 those did not pose a security vulnerability because the radiological sources were locked in other containers			1
at oil and gas facilities , the @entity3 found an apparent loophole that allows companies to place radiological material in separate containers in the same room , thus avoiding stricter regulations than would apply if the material were considered " collocated " in the same container			1
when evaluating trucks equipped to carry portable devices that use the radiological material , the @entity3 found a wide variety of methods used to secure the material , ranging from high - security locks and alarms to simple padlocks and an army surplus container chained to a floor			1
four trucks with radiological sources have been stolen since 2005 , the @entity3 found			2
all but one of the devices were recovered			0
" officials at seven of the 33 licensees we reviewed said that they have granted unescorted access to high - risk radiological sources to individuals with criminal histories , " the @entity3 found			1
in two of the cases , the workers had serious criminal records , including one who was convicted of making terroristic threats against another person			0
several efforts are underway to increase radiological security , but the @entity3 found that " agencies that play a role in nuclear and radiological security are not effectively collaborating to achieve the common mission of securing mobile industrial sources			1
" the @entity3 recommended that agencies work together to provide security , seek input from companies using the radiological material , reconsider collocation rules and evaluate when someone with a criminal history is given unescorted access to radiological material			1
the @entity33 and the @entity126 generally agreed with all of the recommendations			0
declassified report : two nuclear bombs nearly wiped out @entity130			0

investigators visited 33 sites in @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47
door , fencing , worker criminal histories , lack of agency collaboration *criticized*
@entity3 recommends that agencies work together to provide security , seek companies ' input
