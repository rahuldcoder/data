-- until authorities know what happened to @entity4 , they 'll look for clues in the histories of everyone on board			2
the cruel reality is that every one of the 239 people on board is both a possible victim and a possible suspect -- until proved otherwise			1
already , some passengers and the pilots have fallen under increased scrutiny , and more are likely to come into focus as the search for answers continues			1
" you have to look at everybody that got onto that plane , " @entity20 , former assistant director of the @entity21 in @entity22 , told @entity0 's " the lead with @entity28 " on monday			1
" you can start peeling the onion there by eliminating some of the people immediately -- you know , like children , and maybe very elderly people , or infirmed people			2
you might be able to eliminate those folks			0
" but , by the same token , you really have to look through the whole category of people that are on the plane , " he said			1
here 's what we have so far about some of the people investigators want to know more about : pilot : @entity52 @entity51 @entity54 's prime minister has said that somebody deliberately steered the plane off course			1
that means the pilots have become one obvious area of focus			1
on saturday , @entity54 police searched @entity63 's home			1
the 53 - year - old pilot and father of three lives in an upscale , gated community in @entity68 , outside @entity54 's capital , @entity70			1
@entity54 police said sunday they were still investigating a flight simulator seized from that house			1
it 's somewhat common among aviation enthusiasts to use online flight simulator programs to replicate various situations			1
an initial search of the personal computers and e-mails of the pilots found nothing to indicate that a sudden deviation in the @entity86 's route was preplanned , @entity78 officials said on tuesday , after being briefed by @entity54 authorities			1
@entity78 officials reviewed cockpit conversations between the flight and air traffic controllers and again said they saw nothing suspicious or anything that would explain why the jetliner deviated from its course			0
the pilot 's political beliefs are also being questioned			2
@entity52 is a public supporter of @entity54 opposition leader @entity97			1
just hours before the flight took off , a court ordered @entity97 to prison on charges of sodomy , a sentence the opposition leader says is a political vendetta			0
despite the timing of the decision , there is no evidence to tie the plane 's disappearance to the pilot or his politics			1
" he likely was upset at the verdict that had just been announced several hours before he boarded the aircraft , but to down an airline because of that i think at this point is pure conjecture			0
again , i would take any of these accusations with a huge grain of salt , " the @entity120 's @entity119 told @entity0 's " @entity124			2
" @entity125 , a friend of @entity52 's , similarly said it 's unfair to imply the pilot had anything to do with what happened to the plane			1
he said he 'd been to @entity52 's house and tried out the flight simulator			2
" it 's a reflection of his love for people , " @entity125 said , " because he wants to share the joy of flying with his friends			1
" @entity52 joined @entity140 in 1981 and has more than 18,000 flying hours			0
who were the pilots ? co-pilot : @entity145 @entity145 , 27 , started at the airline in 2007 and has 2,763 flying hours			2
two vans were loaded with small bags , similar to shopping bags , at the home of the co-pilot , according to a @entity0 crew that observed activities at the residence			0
it was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home , and police made no comment about their activities there			0
@entity78 intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that " those in the cockpit " -- the captain and co-pilot -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance , a @entity78 official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking has told @entity0			0
the official emphasized that no final conclusions have been drawn and that all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date			0
acting @entity54 transportation minister @entity175 has told reporters the pilots did n't request to work together			1
passenger : @entity179 the 29 - year - old @entity54 civil aviation engineer works for a private jet charter company			1
although police are investigating all passengers and crew , he is likely to be of particular interest because of his aviation knowledge			2
" i am confident that he is not involved , " his father said monday			0
" they 're welcome to investigate me and my family			0
" the bottom line , investigators say , is that whoever flew the plane off course for hours appeared to know what they were doing			2
they are looking into the backgrounds of the passengers to see whether any of them were trained pilots			0
" there are still a few countries who have yet to respond to our request for a background check , " said @entity200 , inspector general of the @entity201			0
" but there are a few ... foreign intelligence agencies who have cleared all the ( ir ) passengers			0
" passengers : @entity214 and @entity215 in the first few days after the plane went missing , investigators focused intensely on two passengers who boarded the plane using stolen passports			0
authorities have since identified them as @entity214 , 18 , and @entity215 , 29 , both @entity222			0
the men entered @entity54 on february 28 using valid @entity222 passports , according to @entity225			1
@entity54 police believe @entity214 was trying to emigrate to @entity227 using a stolen @entity229 passport			1
his mother contacted police after her son did n't arrive in @entity232 as expected			0
@entity54 investigators say neither of the men has any apparent connection to terrorist organizations			1
stolen passports do n't necessarily indicate terrorism			0
in fact , passengers flew without having their travel documents checked against @entity225 's lost - and - stolen passport database more than a billion times in 2013 , according to the international police organization			2
terrorist link ? while investigators continue their search , one possibility that has been talked about is that an act of terrorism downed the airliner			0
there has been speculation that @entity255 separatists in @entity258 's far western @entity257 province might have been involved in the plane 's disappearance			1
the @entity261 are a predominantly @entity255 ethnic group who live in @entity257 , an area the size of @entity222 that is rich in natural resources , including oil			0
one of the two long corridors where authorities say the plane was last detected stretched over @entity257 , and unconfirmed reports have suggested the possibility that @entity261 might be connected to the case			0
@entity274 authorities have accused separatists from @entity257 of carrying out a terrorist attack this month in which eight attackers armed with long knives stormed a train station in @entity281 , a city in southwestern @entity258 , killing 29 people and wounding more than 140			2
however , on tuesday , @entity258 said it found no evidence that any of its citizens on board the missing plane were involved in hijacking or terrorism			2
background checks on all passengers from the @entity274 mainland on the plane have found nothing to support such suspicions , said @entity295 , the @entity274 ambassador to @entity54 , according to the state - run @entity274 news agency @entity296			1
authorities have said they are investigating all 239 people who were on board the flight			1
according to the airline , 153 of the 227 passengers came from @entity258 or @entity304			0
by effectively ruling out suspicions for most of the passengers , @entity274 authorities appear to have significantly shortened the list of possible suspects in the investigation			0
snapshots of passengers @entity0 's @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319 contributed to this report .			0

new : pilots ' computers show nothing to indicate sudden deviation was preplanned
every one of the 239 people on board is both a possible victim and suspect
the plane 's pilots have become one obvious area of focus
a 29 - year - old @entity54 civil aviation engineer is also under the *spotlight*
