@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 accused the @entity3 of " lying " about the effectiveness of torture , called for the resignation of its director and blasted president @entity10 's handling of the spy agency on the @entity13 floor wednesday			1
in a 48 - minute speech , the @entity15 @entity14 called on @entity10 to " purge his administration " of @entity3 officials , including director @entity19 , involved in the interrogation techniques detailed in a new @entity22 report			1
he also revealed what he called the " key findings and conclusions " of an internal @entity3 review commissioned by former director @entity27 -- which the @entity10 administration has not publicly released			1
" director @entity19 and the @entity3 today are continuing to willfully provide inaccurate information and misrepresent the efficacy of torture , " @entity2 said			1
" in other words : the @entity3 is lying			2
" @entity36 press secretary @entity35 defended @entity19 on wednesday , telling reporters that he has done an " exemplary job " and that @entity10 is " pleased to rely on his advice			0
" @entity2 's comments came the day after @entity22 chairwoman @entity42 ( @entity43 ) released an explosive report detailing the rough techniques the @entity3 used to interrogate detainees under president @entity47			1
the report suggests those techniques -- including mock executions , sleep deprivation , beating detainees , feeding them rectally and threatening the lives of their families -- produced faulty intelligence			0
it also said the @entity3 misled @entity56 and the @entity36			0
but @entity19 pushed back , acknowledging in a statement that the @entity3 made " mistakes " but saying those techniques " did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans , capture terrorists , and save lives			1
the intelligence gained from the program was critical to our understanding of @entity68 and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day			0
" @entity2 -- who lost his re-election bid in november and is leaving office in just weeks -- said he was frustrated with those comments wednesday , and repeated his previous call for @entity19 's resignation			1
he also accused @entity10 of failing to live up to his pledges during the 2008 campaign to be more transparent about the use of torture			0
and he said the @entity3 's internal @entity27 review 's findings reveal that the @entity36 is misleading the public			0
" one would think this administration is leading the effort to right the wrongs of the past and ensure the @entity87 people learn the truth about the @entity3 's torture program , " @entity2 said			2
it 's been nearly a six - year struggle in a @entity93 administration to get this study out			0
for a while i worried that this administration would succeed in keeping this study entirely under wraps			0
" while the study clearly shows that the @entity3 detention and interrogation program itself was deeply flawed , the deeper , more endemic problem lies in the @entity3 , assisted by a @entity36 that continues to try to cover up the truth			2

sen. @entity2 accused the @entity3 of " lying " about the effectiveness of torture on the @entity13 floor
his comments come the day after a @entity13 panel released a report on @entity3 interrogation techniques
