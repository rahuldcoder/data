-- december 9 , 2009 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 @entity8 , @entity9 transcript this is a @entity12			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			0
@entity16 , @entity17 : hi , i 'm @entity19			0
you 've landed on @entity0			0
first up : job creation @entity21 : during a speech yesterday , president @entity22 offered some ideas on how to create new jobs and help out the country 's economy : offering tax breaks to small businesses , expanding some of the government 's stimulus programs , and spending more funds on infrastructure projects -- things like roads , bridges and water systems			1
the thing is , all of that costs money			1
and that 's where the @entity43 comes in			1
that 's the @entity43 , the financial industry bailout passed last year			1
the bailout ended up not costing as much as expected , and president @entity22 thinks the extra could be used to help out in other ways			1
@entity49 president @entity22 : the @entity43 program was flawed and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly			1
and today , @entity43 has served its original purpose and at much lower cost than we expected			1
in fact , because of our stewardship of this program and the transparency and accountability that we put in place , @entity43 is expected to cost taxpayers at least $ 200 billion less than it was anticipated just this past summer			1
@entity21 : couple of things to keep in mind here , though			0
first , @entity67 officials say that they ca n't just use @entity43 money to pay for infrastructure projects ; the program just does n't work like that			1
and second , some republicans are outraged by the idea of spending any unused @entity43 funds because they say that money was supposed to help pay off the country 's debt			1
@entity78 @entity77 , ( r ) minority leader : this makes me so angry			0
i know all about @entity43			0
first , it was never intended that all this money would ever have to be spent			1
but any money that was n't spent was to go to the deficit			1
and the idea of taking this money and spending it is repulsive			1
health care debate @entity21 : senators are considering alternatives to part of their health care legislation			0
specifically , the so - called public option : that 's a government - run health insurance program			1
@entity96 , and some @entity97 and @entity98 , are against that plan			0
a group of @entity97 senators was working to come up with some other ideas that could replace the public option			0
late last night , they said they had reached an agreement			0
if the @entity108 passes its health care bill , that does n't make it law			0
it would still need to be combined with the @entity67 bill , and then that final version would need to pass both the @entity67 and the @entity108			0
@entity114 @entity21 : the head of @entity5 's government says that a series of suicide bombings is designed to create chaos in that country and prevent progress toward elections that are scheduled for next year			2
prime minister @entity123 called yesterday 's terrorist attacks " cowardly			2
" the five explosions killed more than 125 people and injured more than 440 others			2
the bombings all took place within minutes of each other tuesday morning			0
they targeted several government buildings around the capital city of @entity4 , as well as a neighborhood and a business district			0
is this legit ? @entity136 , @entity17 : is this legit ? @entity137 is the @entity49 secretary of defense			1
not legit ! @entity138 is the defense secretary			0
he was appointed by president @entity139 , and president @entity22 asked him to stay on the job			0
defense secretary visit @entity21 : it 's mr. @entity138 ' job to advise the president on military issues like the war in @entity7			1
and that is where the defense secretary is right now , meeting with military officials and @entity7 leaders following president @entity22 's announcement that he plans to send 30,000 additional @entity49 forces to @entity7			1
@entity153 has more on mr. @entity138 ' trip there and some of the challenges that @entity49 troops face there			1
( begin video ) @entity159 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : defense secretary @entity160 arrived in @entity7 on an unannounced trip			1
he is here , of course , for the first time since president @entity22 made the announcement that 30,000 additional @entity49 troops will be headed to this war zone			1
the defense secretary plans to meet with troops , commanders , and he has already met with @entity7 president @entity169 to talk about the way ahead , @entity138 assuring @entity169 that the @entity49 has a continuing commitment to this country			1
but where we are right now , at @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , south of @entity6 , really illustrates the continuing security challenge in this country			2
the @entity181 task force that operates here has already had the plus - up from 300 troops to 3,000 troops operating in this region to try and get a handle on security against the @entity189 and the insurgents			1
one of their major jobs here is to continue every day to secure @entity194 , the main road to @entity6			2
the road is secure right now , they tell us , because the troops , @entity49 and @entity7 troops , are out patrolling every day			1
if the troops were n't out there , the feeling is that the @entity189 and the insurgents would again rear their head and control the road and really hinder commerce and development in this region			2
so , that 's the bottom line here			2
it 's a continuing , spotty security picture			1
where the troops are , security improves			1
but where the troops are not located , security still very troublesome in many areas of this country			1
( @entity215 ) promo @entity21 : another member of president @entity22 's @entity218 , education secretary @entity219 , can have an impact on your education			2
@entity223 , @entity224 @entity67 correspondent , is going to interview @entity225 , and mr. @entity223 wants to know what you would ask @entity219 if you had the chance			0
so , teachers and students , share your questions on our blog			2
we 'll share them with @entity223 , and you might hear your question answered on our show			2
@entity236 @entity237 , @entity17 : time for the shoutout ! when does winter officially start ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) october 31 , @entity244 ) november 15 , c ) december 21 or @entity245 ) january 1 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! winter begins around december 21 , which is the winter solstice , the shortest day of the year			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity251 @entity21 : do n't tell that to the folks who are already getting hammered by the first major storm of the season			2
states out west got slammed by two to three feet of snow , winds whipping around at up to 90 miles per hour			0
even some desert states felt the freeze			0
check out this video from @entity261 ! the storm is making its way east , and as of yesterday , parts of @entity265 and @entity266 were both under a blizzard warning			0
@entity269 @entity21 : some homes are protected against winter cold by weatherizing , which keeps heat in and costs down			0
installing it is an example of a green - collar job , work that 's focused on the environment			1
@entity279 shows us how some folks are learning to be part of a green - collar world			1
( begin video ) @entity285 : hot air is coming into your house			0
you know that you 're losing , what ? @entity290 : energy			0
@entity291 , @entity0 business correspondent : the skills taught here are green			2
@entity285 : this is recycled newspaper			0
@entity295 : and so are the students			2
@entity297 , program director , @entity299 : we do work with 17 - to 24 - year - olds who lack work history , are often low income , court involved			1
our corps members do n't want to hang out on the street			0
they want to be productive			0
@entity295 : that 's where @entity309 comes in			2
based in @entity8 and funded through a grant from the @entity49 @entity313 , the program teaches young adults how to weatherize and rehabilitate homes			1
@entity316 : we 're giving a general base of construction knowledge , carpentry skills			0
we also emphasize academic improvement , work readiness , and really encourage our corps members to make positive life decisions			0
@entity285 : there 's a lot of work to be done in @entity8			2
@entity295 : one of the people doing that work is @entity330 graduate @entity329			2
after completing the program , he landed a job with local contractor @entity333 , weatherizing homes and building new ones			2
@entity336 , @entity337 : i believe that this program helps kids by , you know , letting them see that there is another way , you know , besides , you know , maybe they are n't , you know , high ... maybe they do n't have their high school diploma , or maybe they are n't the ones who go to college			1
so this program , you know , it invites them in and it gives them the opportunity to learn a trade , you know , to learn a skill			1
on average , their energy bill will be $ 20 - $ 30 on a month			2
@entity295 : despite @entity329 's success , jobs are still hard to come by			1
so far , out of 177 @entity330 graduates , 37 percent have found jobs and a third have gone back to school			2
even those who did n't immediately find work have achieved something			0
@entity370 , brotherhood way : for @entity329 and so many other young adults , when they finish the program , they are ready to be thrown into the work force			1
@entity295 : so , when the job market does turn around , they 're ready			0
@entity279 , @entity0 , @entity378			0
( @entity215 ) before we go @entity21 : before we go , we have some really cool pictures for you today , but as neat as they look , it does n't seem like a good idea			0
up to 20 - foot waves -- swells so powerful that people staying in a hotel near the shore could feel them crash -- they thundered in to the @entity392 island of @entity393 on tuesday			1
they kept tourists from sleeping , ate up tons of beach , and despite the power and the danger , yep , surf 's up ! hope these guys know what they 're doing			0
goodbye @entity21 : because for amateurs like me , it would 've been a total washout			0
@entity0 is rolling in again tomorrow , keeping you current on more headlines			0
we 'll see you then .			0
