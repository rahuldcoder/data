editor 's note : @entity2 is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts " @entity4 " on @entity5 at 1 and 5 p.m. @entity6 , and on @entity7 0900 , 1600 @entity8 l 1300 , 2000 @entity9 l 2000 , 0300 hk @entity2 says " no one bought " @entity13 's " divine assessment " of the official election result			1
( @entity5 ) -- the decisive margin of @entity18 president @entity17 's victory in the june 12 election stunned many observers and angered his opponents ' supporters , who in the ensuing days took to the streets in protest by the hundreds of thousands			1
some experts have called the effect unprecedented : several powerful figures have openly supported the top challenger , @entity28 , even as the supreme leader , ayatollah @entity13 , has endorsed the official results favoring @entity17			0
in the meantime , using online social networking sites such as @entity32 , @entity18 have been able to get around the government 's efforts to restrict media coverage , and the outcry against the election result has intensified			1
at friday prayers in @entity40 , @entity13 told a partisan audience the " ruling elites " would be " held accountable for all violence and blood and rioting			0
" @entity5 spoke with @entity2 about the significance of the recent protests and the leadership 's response : @entity5 : as you 've seen the situation in @entity18 develop over the last week , what are your thoughts ? @entity2 : one of the first things that strikes me is we are watching the fall of @entity59 theocracy			1
@entity5 : do you mean you think the regime will fall ? @entity2 : no , i do n't mean the @entity18 regime will fall soon			1
it may -- i certainly hope it will -- but repressive regimes can stick around for a long time			2
i mean that this is the end of the ideology that lay at the basis of the @entity18 regime			1
the regime 's founder , ayatollah @entity70 , laid out his special interpretation of political islam in a series of lectures in 1970			2
in this interpretation of @entity78 , @entity59 jurists had divinely ordained powers to rule as guardians of the society , supreme arbiters not only on matters of morality but politics as well			2
when @entity70 established the @entity86 of @entity18 , this idea was at its heart			2
last week , that ideology suffered a fatal wound			0
@entity5 : how so ? @entity2 : when the supreme leader , ayatollah @entity13 , declared the election of @entity17 a " divine assessment , " he was indicating it was divinely sanctioned			1
but no one bought it			0
he was forced to accept the need for an inquiry into the election			0
the @entity99 , @entity18 's supreme constitutional body , met with the candidates and promised to investigate and perhaps recount some votes			1
@entity13 has subsequently hardened his position but that is now irrelevant			0
something very important has been laid bare in @entity18 today --- legitimacy does not flow from divine authority but from popular support			2
@entity5 : there have been protests in @entity18 before			1
what makes this different ? @entity2 : in the past the protests were always the street against the state , and the clerics all sided with the state			1
when the reformist president , @entity117 , was in power , he entertained the possibility of siding with the street , but eventually stuck with the establishment			2
the street and state are at odds again but this time the clerics are divided			1
@entity117 has openly sided with the challenger , @entity28 , as has the reformist @entity126			0
so has @entity127 , the speaker of the parliament and a man with strong family connections to the highest levels of the religious hierarchy			0
behind the scenes , the former president , @entity133 , now head of the assembly of experts , another important constitutional body , is waging a campaign against @entity17 and even the supreme leader himself			0
if senior clerics dispute @entity13 's divine assessment and argue that the @entity99 is wrong , it is a death blow to the basic premise behind the @entity18			1
it is as if a senior @entity145 leader had said in 1980 that @entity146 was not the right guide to economic policy			0
@entity5 : what should the @entity149 do ? @entity2 : i would say continue what we have been doing			1
by reaching out to @entity18 , publicly and repeatedly , president @entity154 has made it extremely difficult for the @entity18 regime to claim that they are battling an aggressive @entity149 bent on attacking @entity18			1
in his inaugural address , his @entity161 greetings , and his @entity163 speech , there is a consistent effort to convey respect and friendship for @entity18			2
that is why @entity13 reacted so angrily to the @entity161 greeting			0
it undermined the image of the @entity171 that he routinely paints in his sermons			0
in his friday sermon , @entity13 said that the @entity149 , @entity174 , and especially the @entity175 were behind the street protests , an accusation that will surely sound ridiculous to most @entity18			1
the fact that @entity154 has been cautious in his reaction makes it all the harder for @entity13 and @entity17 to wrap themselves in a nationalist flag			2
@entity5 : but should n't the @entity149 be more vocal in support for the @entity18 protesters ? @entity2 : i think a good historic analogy is president @entity187 's cautious response to the cracks in the @entity145 empire in 1989			1
then , many neo-conservatives were livid with @entity187 for not loudly supporting those trying to topple the communist regimes in @entity193			0
but @entity187 's concern was that the situation was fragile			0
those regimes could easily crack down on the protestors and the @entity145 could send in tanks			0
handing the communists reasons to react forcefully would help no one , least of all the protesters			0
@entity187 's basic approach was correct and has been vindicated by history			0
@entity5 : finally , do you think the regime will survive ? @entity2 : as i said before , repressive regimes can last a long time , and this regime can definitely endure if they are willing to use force , impose a strict crackdown on protests , and arrest the leaders of the opposition			1
only time will tell , so we will have see what develops .			0

" we are watching the fall of @entity59 theocracy " in @entity18 , @entity2 tells @entity5
@entity2 : " street and state are at odds again , but this time the clerics are divided "
@entity154 's overtures make it hard for regime to *demonize* @entity149 , @entity2 says
