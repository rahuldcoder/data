@entity0 , congratulations ! you 've won an @entity4 ! now you 'd better watch out			1
if there is such a thing as an " oscar curse " -- that malady that suddenly grips some @entity4 winners , plunging their once - bright careers into " @entity11 " - like darkness -- best actor winner @entity0 could be a likely victim			1
among the newly anointed crop of @entity4 recipients , the " @entity17 " star would be right to be wary			1
he 's young -- just 33 -- and could just as easily aim for big - budget movie stardom as chewy character roles			2
a few more films like " @entity22 , " the current @entity25 siblings ' bomb that features @entity0 in a major role , and he may be the answer to @entity4 trivia questions in 2025			1
sunday 's other acting winners may not have the same challenges			1
@entity31 , who won best supporting actor for " @entity33 , " has been a character mainstay for years ; he might start getting bigger billing , but the work should remain steady			2
best actress winner @entity36 ( " @entity37 " ) is an established star and is probably at little risk of going off the rails			2
and @entity40 , the best supporting actress winner for " boyhood , " has made a career of combining intriguing film choices with steady tv work			0
indeed , she 's the star of " csi : cyber , " which debuts march 4			0
now , " curse " might be a little strong			1
some performers such as @entity50 ( " the @entity52 " ) or @entity51 ( " @entity53 " ) were character types who hit it big			0
it would be unlikely for them to suddenly become successful headliners			0
other actors prefer to pick interesting roles in small , quirky movies rather than let @entity63 's box - office machinery pigeonhole them			1
on the other hand , there are any number of " it " performers -- especially actresses such as @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 -- who had youth , looks and chops and were pegged as future leads			0
but whether through poor script choices , fickle audiences or movie - industry biases , their follow - ups tanked			0
( many of the entries on this list seem to be less the victim of a " curse " than industry preconceptions about women 's roles			2
) certainly the @entity4 is a wonderful honor , a permanent prefix to an actor 's name			1
but some may wonder if all the red - carpet scrutiny and stress was worth it			0
check out the gallery for a few examples .			0

an " oscar curse " seems to *plague* some @entity4 winners
many actors win @entity4 , then see their next films flop
