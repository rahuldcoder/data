-- @entity2 's wife was killed by last year 's tsunami but as a father of two and mayor of @entity6 in @entity8 's @entity7 he has little time to grieve			1
@entity2 's daily routine starts by driving his two sons -- 13 - year - old @entity12 and 11 - year - old @entity13 -- to their elementary and junior high schools ; two structures that were not affected by the tsunami and the reason they were not victims of the disaster			1
fortunately for @entity22 the route does n't take him past his old house where his wife perished			1
he says he does n't like to see it and be reminded of his loss			2
like many overstretched single parents , @entity2 sees his shortcomings before his successes			2
" to be honest , i have n't done enough for my boys as a father , " he says , the weariness of the year weighing on the 47 - year - old 's face			2
" but i try to be with them when i have time			0
" as mayor of @entity6 , time is in short supply for @entity2			1
the work to rebuild the town 's entire downtown that destroyed by the tsunami is almost overwhelming			1
the cost of the damage is estimated at $ 1.6 billion			0
much of the rubble has been cleared away but the shells of many of the larger structures still stand			0
the mayor has laid out an eight year reconstruction plan and recently secured funding from the @entity8 government			1
the first three years are dedicated to mapping out the infrastructure and design of a new city , which includes moving its center to higher ground			1
send in your memories of last year 's disaster in @entity8 @entity2 spends most of his days fielding questions and demands from residents , while prioritizing the endless needs of a city on the mend			1
he 's also an advocate for the city , urging the remaining 22,000 residents to stay through the long rebuilding process			1
more than 1,000 people have n't heeded his call and have abandoned the city			1
@entity73 is one resident who is sticking it out in @entity6			1
a nurse at a local hospital destroyed by the tsunami , she was in shock immediately after the disaster and recounted how she had to leave bedridden patients to drown in their hospital beds			2
" the patients could n't walk			0
i looked out and the wave was as high as the fourth floor window , " she said when interviewed soon after the tragedy			0
" ' i 'm sorry , ' i told the patient , and i ran upstairs			0
it is the biggest regret i have			0
" @entity87 was set to retire this year but has continued to work in a temporary building that is the city 's hospital			2
she lost her home and relatives in the disaster and sees little joy in giving up what 's left in her life			1
" one year is n't enough to heal , " she says			0
" my job is to be with people and share their pain			0
" @entity87 says without the survivors ' personal sacrifice and determination to stay and rebuild , the town will disappear			1
mayor @entity2 is a potent symbol of that personal sacrifice			1
he does n't want to be seen as a brave man and uses his work as an escape from his terrible sorrow			0
" my job as mayor takes precedence to being a father right now			2
i do n't have time to be alone			0
i do n't have time to feel sad or cry , which may mentally help me survive right now			0
" it is hard for me to live without the person who was supposed to always be with me			0
i feel her telling me to work hard for this town			0
someday soon my sons will look at this town and understand why their father was n't around more			2
