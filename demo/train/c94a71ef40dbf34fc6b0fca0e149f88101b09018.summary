-- @entity1 is cutting retailer @entity2 down to size			1
@entity1 , who blogs under the name " @entity5 " and wears a size 22 , changed the brand 's @entity2 logo to " @entity12 " in a mock , black - and - white @entity2 ad to challenge the line 's branding efforts			1
the photos come as a provocative response to contentious comments @entity2 ceo @entity17 made in a 2006 salon article about the multibillion - dollar brand 's target audience			1
" in every school there are the cool and popular kids , and then there are the not - so - cool kids , " @entity17 said			1
" candidly , we go after the cool kids			2
we go after the attractive all - american kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends			1
a lot of people do n't belong [ in our clothes ] , and they ca n't belong			2
are we exclusionary ? absolutely			0
" the divisive remarks resurfaced earlier this month after a series of protests went viral , from @entity38 's video of himself giving homeless people @entity2 clothing to a @entity42 petition for larger sizes by a teenage eating disorder survivor			1
the plus - size community particularly took umbrage to the ceo 's business model because the retailer currently does not offer clothes above size 10 or large for women			1
" i challenge the separation of attractive and fat , and i assert that they are compatible regardless of what you believe , " @entity1 , 26 , wrote in a public letter addressed to the ceo			1
@entity17 has since apologized in a statement : " while i believe this 7 - year - old , resurrected quote has been taken out of context , i sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense			1
" @entity1 spoke to @entity0 about @entity17 ' comments and her motivations to address them			1
the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity			0
@entity0 : you start your letter with a preface that @entity17 ' opinion " is n't shocking ; millions share the same sentiment			0
" the comments are from 2006 -- what motivated you to act on them ? @entity1 : it really was n't upset or outrage at all			1
i 've been an art major for the majority of my academic life , and so i am always trying to find opportunities to do something artistic			0
i just thought we do n't see the juxtaposition of typical and atypical bodies in advertising specifically			0
since i am a woman and i am fat and that 's what i have to work with , i wanted to show that contrast by finding a male model			1
really , it just came because i wanted to not be angry about it			0
i wanted to not say , " this is an outrage , i 've never heard of this before , " but say , " ok , well , look at this			0
look at how awesome this is			0
" and , i think when you 're talking about really serious subjects , and this is kind of serious , it 's important to be a little bit cheeky and pull in a little bit of humor so that it 's approachable -- and it worked			1
@entity0 : in your letter , you credit @entity17 with creating " an incredible opportunity for social change			0
" what did you mean by that ? @entity1 : in the body - positive world , which is still a subculture , fashion for fat people -- what they call " fatshion " -- is a really big political statement			1
so is the concept of , for example , a fat person walking around wearing cut - off shorts and not apologizing for their body being so observable			1
being positive and having confidence is a huge deal			0
through a very , very large company that deals with fashion and also deals with unrealistic body images , it 's a perfect opportunity			1
you 're bringing in fashion , you 're bringing in body consciousness in general , you 're bringing in kids who shop at the mall -- it 's all these wonderful things combined in one opportunity			2
@entity0 : have you always been comfortable in your own body ? @entity1 : no , no , no. i think of all of us , to some certain extent , feel the same things			1
i was crippled from shame my entire life			0
only in this last year have i been so dedicated to this journey of learning how to survive bad days and find wanted days			0
if anyone tells you they have 100 % good days , they 're probably lying			0
i have 26 years to undo and rewire and i 'm still working on it , but it 's definitely a very conscious decision			2
and writing has really helped , as well			0
@entity0 : the response has obviously been huge			0
@entity1 : it 's wonderful			1
i 'm sure there are negatives , but for every negative , there are 20 positives			0
the most powerful part is saying there is a reality that you can exist in where you 're ok , and it does n't make you gullible or delusional , it makes you strong			0
for a lot of people , it 's just a light bulb			2
i know i had one where i said " what ? i do n't have to live in self - loathing for the rest of my life ? " people are entertaining the idea that maybe there is a piece of self - worth for them out there somewhere			2
and once it starts , it grows			0
@entity0 : let 's talk about the actual photo shoot			2
were you nervous ? @entity1 : i had never met the model until that day			1
i credit the majority of this to the photographer , @entity188 , because she really made it come to life			2
he was the most genuine , down - to - earth person			2
it was so much fun			0
in the beginning , i was nervous , but mostly because i had never modeled with other people			0
i have done solo fashion modeling , but never with another person and never in a sexual manner -- so it was a really interesting experiment			0
@entity0 : have you heard from @entity17 or @entity2 ? @entity1 : no , i did n't write this letter technically for them			1
i like to not invest a lot of my time in people who are dedicated to misunderstanding me			0
what i wanted to do is reach women who look and feel like me			2
we never see this pairing ; we never see a fat woman in a positive light			2
i want to empower the individual woman			0
when @entity17 is gone , there 's going to be another company			2
it 's not about the extra-large shirts at @entity2 ; it 's about teaching the world that everybody is equal in value			1

comments made by @entity2 's ceo offended some *consumers*

@entity1 says women and men can be " attractive and fat , " so retailers should take notice
