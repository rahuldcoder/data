they 've been trained to focus for weeks at a time on a single goal			2
they know how to clearly identify obstacles and form step - by - step plans to overcome them			2
they 're obsessed with improving specific skills but judge success only by overall progress made in the world they 've decided to conquer -- as realistic or fantastical as it may be			2
it 's precisely these traits that make video - gamers great bodybuilders			1
take a moment to laugh , if you must			2
@entity20 and @entity21 were the stereotypical video - gamers in high school			1
one was scrawny , the other fat			2
they grew up playing marathon sessions of " @entity27 " and " counter-strike			2
" " i literally would wake up and play all day , eating intermittently , " @entity21 said			2
" ok , when i say intermittently , i mean eating a lot			2
" but by the time the men met at the @entity32 in 2004 , they had traded an obsession with video gaming for an obsession with weight - lifting			1
as they shared stories at the gym , they realized their healthy transformation had been easier for them than for most			2
why ? because they were -- and would always be -- gamers			2
" people do n't realize that video games are an expression of personality , " @entity21 said			1
" there 's certain qualities that people have			2
they 're obsessed with improving the stat sheets , getting to the next level ; they pay a lot of attention to detail			0
guys who play ( ' @entity60 ' ) ... are very intense about whatever they do			0
they can turn that addiction and all its characteristics into fitness			1
" it 's a theory they 're taking to the bank			0
@entity68 and @entity20 are the co-founders of @entity70 , a website that 's turning gaming geeks into fitness geeks			1
the site has 70,000 users in its beta version and hopes to open to the 60,000 on a waiting list in the next couple months			0
@entity70 members can " level up " by earning points for their workouts			1
new levels unlock special challenges or " quests " that are designed to push users out of their comfort zones			0
for example , a runner might have to do yoga , or a bodybuilder might have to tackle a @entity90			0
still , one has to wonder : what would make a virtual warrior trade in his sword and shield for a pair of dumbbells ? the same thing that got him interested in playing video games in the first place , dr. @entity97 says			1
@entity97 and dr. @entity102 are co-authors of the book " glued to @entity105 : how @entity105 and hold @entity106			1
" as experts on human motivation , they have identified basic psychological needs -- similar to physical needs like food , water and sleep -- that video games satisfy			1
first , @entity102 says , is the need to feel competent			0
in real life , you get the chance to " level up " only once every couple years : like when you earn a promotion at work or get married			0
in games , you always know what you have to do to get to the next level			1
" in video games , you 're constantly getting information about your achievements and ( learning ) how to do things better , " @entity102 says			1
" there 's an opportunity to develop a mastery that 's very much a key motivator			0
" that translates well to fitness , where tracking your accomplishments enables you to progress quicker			1
you know you 've improved when you run an extra mile or dead lift another 50 pounds			0
a second motivator in video games is the feeling of freedom and autonomy , @entity97 says			1
people like to know they have control over their future			0
in video games , you can choose your path , the skills you want to improve , even your outfit			1
making the same choices in your fitness regimen helps you feel empowered			1
" games make the goals really clear , " @entity97 said			1
" you have to run from point a to point b , deliver a message , kill this bad guy			0
you have a very clear sense of ' if i just do these steps , i will succeed			0
' and let 's call them quests because it sounds heroic			0
and who does n't want to feel like a hero ? " @entity70 user @entity170 says that what 's most important to him is the community on the website , which resembles that of his favorite online game , " @entity60			1
" in any massively multiplayer online role - playing game , you work with other players to conquer enemies			1
your team expects you to show up and do what needs to be done			0
he gets the same sense of accountability from the members on @entity70			1
" when i was playing @entity60 all the time , i had to make sure everything i was doing was right			0
i researched it down to the @entity186 i made sure i was hitting spells right at the right time			0
i would n't miss a raid , " @entity170 said			0
" i think that translates really well to exercise and bodybuilding because you have to have that level of knowledge , ( and ) you have to have that commitment			1
" @entity97 says the community around online games , or fitness , satisfies one of the last psychological needs : relationships			1
" there 's a social component to it			0
... you 're relying on each other			0
you really need the other person to watch your back and vice versa , " he said			0
" ( games ) build in a sense of ' i matter to others ; others matter to me			2
' " of course , motivation is n't restricted to video gamers			1
everyone has these basic intrinsic psychological needs and can apply them to fitness			1
gamers just have an easier time learning the language			0
" what video game players have is a certain understanding for how these sort of fitness structures are built : goal - setting , progression , etc. " @entity97 said			1
" in other words , it 's a world that they know			0
" take @entity236 , one of the buffest men in @entity238			0
@entity236 used to play " @entity243 " on his days off as a bouncer in one of @entity242 's nightclubs			0
he contributed the foreword for the book " 30 years of adventure : a celebration of @entity243 , " writing , " we were all drawn to the game because it allowed us to become these characters , vastly different in appearance and in actions , but what kept us hooked was the search for the character that represented our higher self			2
" a quest -- to look different , to act stronger , to be better			0

@entity70 uses video game *techniques* to *encourage* exercise
