-- you pay for checking your baggage , for snacks and for extra legroom			0
word is one airline has even toyed with charging you to use the toilet			0
so it makes perfect sense to some fliers that heavier passengers should pay for spilling over into the next seat			1
earlier this year , @entity14 formalized a policy that charges some larger passengers for a second seat			1
frequent flier @entity18 , 54 , has been sandwiched between larger fliers in coach , and he believes they should have to shell out for a second seat			2
" they have a right to sit in the seat next to me , " said @entity18 , who travels cross-country at least 15 times a year to watch his sons ' sporting matches			2
" but they do n't have a right to sit in my lap. " a growing number of airlines are forcing bigger passengers to pay more as they cope with the costly and uncomfortable quandary that arises when obese passengers can not squeeze into a single coach seat			1
with airlines trimming flight schedules -- meaning fuller passenger loads this summer -- the issue is bound to spur some awkward encounters			2
chart : compare some of the common airline fees " it 's a growing problem , no pun intended , " said @entity45 , president of @entity46 , a site that is part of @entity49 , which provides airfare deals and advice			1
the obese people suffer and the people who are skinny and get spilled over on suffer as well			0
" @entity58 obesity rates have mushroomed during the last 25 years , but the width of a coach airplane seat has changed little , remaining between 17 and 18 inches in most commercial planes			1
more than one - third of @entity58 fall into the obese category , according to the @entity63			0
this makes traveling in tight spaces vexing for airlines trying to bolster profits by selling the maximum number of seats			1
the @entity70 does not regulate seat width , but it does require passengers be able to sit belted and with both arm rests down to comply with safety standards			1
in april , @entity75 's @entity14 formalized a policy that says passengers who are unable to safely fit into one seat must pay full price for a second seat			1
they may receive it free if the plane has vacant seats			2
flight attendants on the airlines are responsible for making sure passengers are fitting in their seats and may ask a heavier passengers requiring two seats to pay extra			1
@entity91 , a spokeswoman for @entity14 , said the company received 700 complaints in 2008 from passengers who were upset because a larger passenger encroached on his or her seat			1
" this new policy was created for the comfort and well - being of all our guests on board , " @entity91 said			0
a survey conducted this year by @entity106 's low - fare airline @entity105 found a third of the 100,000 passengers polled believed a " fat tax " should be instituted , requiring heavier passengers to pay more			1
most @entity58 airlines have a policy or plan for dealing with heavier passengers , though some are not formalized like @entity14 's			1
officials worry heavier passengers squished into one seat may pose a safety hazard when a plane must be evacuated during an emergency			1
@entity121 has had a " customer of size policy " for more than 20 years , requiring passengers to buy a second seat on a full plane if their body crosses the armrest boundary			1
the company will issue refunds if unoccupied seats are available , which they say is the case 97 percent of the time			0
airlines with open seating policies such as @entity121 find it easier to relocate passengers in need of an extra seat			1
on all airlines , passengers can buy first - class or business - class seats , which are wider			2
but those tickets cost more than a coach seat			2
experts at @entity146 , an aircraft manufacturer , say 17 - inch seats can accommodate 95 percent of the traveling public			0
they say studies have found most seat space invasions happen because of wider shoulders and not derrieres			2
still , some larger passengers who need more than one seat believe being charged extra is discriminatory and the airlines are not accommodating the growing @entity58 waistline			1
" the airlines need to be making bigger seats , " said @entity158 , a spokeswoman for the @entity159 , a group based in @entity160 , @entity161			1
" it 's not safe to be cramming us into two seats			2
" lawsuits have been filed by heavier passengers and by those who complain about large passengers encroaching on their space			1
the courts have ruled the airline policies are within their rights			0
in the @entity58 , there are n't any discrimination laws to protect obese people , attorneys say			0
( in some employment discrimination cases , attorneys have been able to win by proving obesity was a genetic disease beyond the person 's control			2
) in 2003 , the issue of passenger weight surfaced when a commuter plane crashed on takeoff from @entity188 , @entity189 , because of excess weight and a maintenance error			0
the accident prompted the @entity70 to increase the estimated weight per passenger by 10 pounds , including 20 pounds of carry - on luggage			0
for example , the average weight for a passenger traveling in the summer ( including carry - on luggage ) went from 180 pounds in 1995 to 190 pounds in 2003			0
" we realized after that accident that the weights we were using probably did n't reflect the current state of the @entity58 traveling public , " said @entity199 , a spokesman with aviation safety at the @entity70			0
in 2004 , a @entity63 scientist studied the effects of obesity on the airline industry			0
the scientist calculated his findings based on data revealing the average weight of an @entity58 had increased by 10 pounds in the 1990s			0
he estimated the extra weight cost airlines $ 275 million extra for fuel in 2000			1
the figures are likely higher today , with fuel costs rising			0
@entity218 , 57 , who works in the radio industry in @entity220 , @entity221 , a city known for its obesity epidemic , said average - sized passengers should not have to incur the higher fuel cost caused by the airline 's heavier customers			1
" a small child needs to pay for a flight , so why would n't an obese person ? " said @entity218 , who flies several times a year , mostly in coach , for personal trips			0
" i 'm not a discriminatory person , but we have to look at the reality of the situation			0
it 's getting a little crowded in here			0
" some larger passengers do n't mind paying for the second seat			2
other heavier fliers argue while tall passengers pay a fee for legroom , the fees are only a fraction of the price of a entire seat			1
@entity248 offers obese passengers booking a second seat up to 33 percent off the ticket price , depending on the type of seat and availability			2
@entity256 of @entity257 , @entity255 says even some normal - sized people ca n't fly comfortably when they are packed in the cabin like sardines			0
@entity256 , 45 , who considers himself a large guy at 400 pounds and over six feet tall , usually pays for two seats			0
" i 'd rather be comfortable first , " he said , " and worry about discrimination later			0

obesity rates have grown in the last 25 years but plane seat sizes remain the same
a growing number of airlines are creating polices to deal with heavier passengers
heavier passengers cost more fuel and space , say some passengers
@entity159 of @entity278 says it 's *unsafe* to cram passengers
