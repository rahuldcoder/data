-- the hottest way to present your resume currently involves just 140 characters and a lot of hype			0
@entity7 resumes -- or " twesumes " -- have been touted as the best way for social media - savvy types to snag a dream job			1
but before you post your own abbreviated cv , it is worth considering its limitations and what tweeting your employment history really says about you			0
" i can not imagine someone explaining their breadth of experience in 140 characters , " says @entity20 , a headhunter and managing director for @entity22 , based in @entity23			0
" i know people are calling it an elevator pitch these days , but my goodness , even that 's a bit longer			1
at most it could be an introduction with a link to your cv			0
" the term twesume ( a contraction of " @entity7 " and " resume " ) began gaining traction in 2011 after it appeared in an article by @entity44 on social media news site , @entity46			1
@entity44 co-founded the website @entity47 , which allows users to upload their resumes and receive an algorithmic - based grading on it			1
in subsequent years , the 140 - character cv has been hailed by some as ushering in a brave new world of truncated , social media - reliant resumes			2
it was reported last year that @entity59 venture capital firm @entity58 and a handful of @entity59 tech companies were to only accept links to jobseekers ' " web presence " -- from blogs to @entity7 accounts -- instead of traditional resumes			1

all candidates were supposed to use the hashtag @entity77 and possess more than 1,000 @entity7 followers			1
@entity72 says he heard from hundreds of applicants and selected 15 for in - person interviews			2
" the main point of this process is that the selection committee , including me , never references their cv , " he wrote to @entity0 in an email			0
" the process was purely a digital research and conversation - oriented recruitment process			1
" although @entity20 is enthusiastic about the business potential for companies using social media , she is n't convinced that @entity7 will replace the resume for job - seekers			1
for her an updated profile on @entity97 is more useful			2
however a tidy web presence is increasingly important			1
international advertising firm @entity99 is currently hiring a director - level candidate for its social media team in @entity23			0
application instructions for a similar posting last year warned : " take a look at your @entity7 / @entity106 profile and if you find the words : maven / guru / expert ? no need to apply			1
we want people whose focus it is to build our clients ' profiles , not their own			0
" the implication is that while social media has made it easier for direct access to companies advertising on @entity7 or @entity97 , it has also made it much easier for unqualified wannabes to jam up the job search			1

she mentions a recent @entity136 - wide search for a director of digital marketing as an example : " we basically honed it down to five candidates			2
and at that point , we actually looked at their online presence			2
we knew them on paper			0
we had talked to them in person and interviewed them a few times			2
and then it was time to see that they 've actually been doing what they say			0
" for businesses , @entity7 is just part of the evolving cornucopia of platforms to share and engage with potential partners and customers			1
the same principles that apply to selling goods are also valid for job - seekers marketing their skills			1
" back in the day , the only way to generate authority in your field was to speak at conferences and write papers and things like that , " says @entity20			0
" now you can write a blog			0
now you can post relevant content to connect with an audience			0
you can create followers for yourself			0
it 's a way to build credibility			2
" whatever the next platform for self - promotion , she urged jobseekers not to abandon commonsense and real - world skills : " nothing beats meeting someone in person , shaking their hand and saying , ' i really want to work with you			0
' that 's what it comes down to			0
among all these online experiences , the success comes in moving them offline .			0
