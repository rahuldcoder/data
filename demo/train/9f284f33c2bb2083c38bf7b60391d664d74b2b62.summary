-- same - sex marriage will be the law of the land -- inevitably but not immediately			1
that 's the message of the @entity6 's decision today to let stand five federal appellate court rulings that recognized a constitutional right for gay people to marry			1
the practical effects of today 's non-decision are considerable			0
at a minimum , it means that the five states whose cases were before the court -- @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 -- should allow same - sex marriage immediately			1
in addition , the states covered by the circuit courts that include these states will almost certainly now allow same - sex marriages as well			1
this includes the @entity30 , covering @entity31 , @entity20 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 ; the @entity35 , including @entity36 , @entity22 and @entity21 ; and the @entity37 , which covers @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity19 , @entity18 and @entity41			0
so for a non-decision , today 's non-ruling has a big impact			1
the justices never explain why they decline to take a case , but it 's possible to offer some informed speculation			0
it takes only four ( of nine ) votes for the court to hear a case			2
so why did n't four justices vote to hear the challenges to the same - sex marriage ban ? the court is polarized , with four conservatives ( chief justice @entity57 and justices @entity58 , @entity60 and @entity61 ) and four liberals ( justices @entity63 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 ) , with @entity68 holding the balance of power , especially on gay rights issues			1
it 's possible that neither the liberal nor the conservative bloc felt confident enough of @entity68 's vote to risk letting him decide the case			1
so better to kick the can down the road			0
the conservatives have a special reason for delay			0
@entity63 , at 81 the oldest justice , will probably leave during the next president 's term			0
a @entity85 president would replace @entity63 with a solid conservative vote and make @entity68 's vote irrelevant			2
so waiting might be an appealing option for them			0
the liberals had their own reasons for delay			0
same - sex marriage has marched with great speed across the country			1
today 's non-decision means that more than half the states , with well more than half the population , have marriage equality			2
those facts create their own momentum			0
more time equals more states , which might ( the theory goes ) make @entity68 's vote easier to get a year from now			1
but for now , the state - by - state battles continue			0
as a result of today 's decision , there will not be a 50 - state resolution any time soon			2
but the direction of the country , if not the court , is clear , and that 's more important than any @entity6 decision .			2

@entity115 : decision to let same - sex marriage rulings stand has big impact
5 states with cases before court will allow same - sex marriage ; others likely will , too , he says
@entity115 : @entity127 , conservative blocs could n't count on @entity68 *swing* vote , perhaps
@entity115 says the decision buys time ; it may sway @entity68 if more states get equality
