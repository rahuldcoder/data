-- when @entity3 made the surprise announcement on thursday 's " @entity5 with @entity3 " that he planned to retire in 2015 , his stated reasons were that he was just about to turn 67 , had been doing the job for more than three decades and wanted to spend more time with his son and family			1
hard to argue with any of that			0
an unstated reason is probably that the younger new wave of late - night tv hosts is not only nipping at his heels but pulling ahead of him			1
most important of all , however , is that in the age of the @entity22 , the way viewers take in late - night tv is not what it was when @entity3 was honing his style			1
the battle for viewers is now fought more with four - minute viral videos the next morning than complete shows with monologues and conversations as integral ingredients			2
today 's late - night tv is about bite - size bits			1
@entity3 liked to serve multicourse meals			0
indeed , his mastery of the form has kept him behind a talk - show desk for 33 years			1
start with four months as the host of daytime 's " the @entity41 " in 1980			0
add the 1982 - 93 run of " @entity44 with @entity3 " on @entity45 , followed by the " @entity5 with @entity3 " run that 's 21 years now and counting			2
by the time @entity3 walks out of the @entity48 for the last time , he 'll have clocked a third of a century as a late - night tv host and monologist			1
that 's longer than @entity52 , who was the former late - night king at 30 years			1
longer than @entity53 , who managed 20 in two different shifts			0
longer than anyone at that very rarified , high - pressure job			0
like @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 before him , @entity3 brought enough to the party to rank him as one of the very best			0
even though @entity53 's " @entity68 , " a direct time - slot rival to @entity3 's program on @entity71 , drew more viewers for most of its run , @entity3 produced more memorable programs , more classic bits and -- as when he was the first @entity75 talk - show host to return after , and react to , the terrorist attacks of september 11 -- more instances of truly classic television moments			1
the speculation tying the timing of @entity3 's departure to the introduction of @entity80 in february as the newest host of " @entity68 " probably has some validity			1
it 's no secret that @entity3 wanted to be @entity52 's successor and long saw @entity45 's " tonight " as the crown jewel of late - night tv , which it had been throughout the reigns of @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity52			1
after being passed over for @entity53 , @entity3 subsequently saw the @entity45 job go to @entity91 , to leno again and then to @entity92			2
certainly , by the time @entity92 started at " tonight , " @entity3 was used to being beaten in the ratings by @entity45 , and that trend has only intensified			2
since the latest late - night talent shifts , @entity92 's " @entity68 " has drawn about twice as many viewers as @entity3 ( 5.2 million to @entity3 's 2.7 , with @entity98 's " @entity97 " just behind @entity3 at 2.6 )			1
in the coveted 18 - 49 demographic , @entity3 comes in third , behind @entity101 as well as @entity92			2
but the real shift is n't in who 's watching but in who 's not watching			0
" @entity68 " of the @entity52 era , so revered by @entity3 ( and by older viewers and tv critics like myself ) , was must - see tv before that term was invented			2
millions of people did n't think of going to bed before hearing @entity52 's monologue , to get his take on what happened that day			2
in 2014 , though , that 's simply not happening			0
every term , i ask my college students at @entity119 how many of them watch any of the late - night shows as they 're first televised			1
this includes even @entity124 's " @entity122 with @entity123 " and " @entity125 , " for which they 're the ideal target audience			0
and every term , fewer hands go up			0
they are waiting for those pieces of the previous night 's talk shows spoon - fed to them , either as morning - show highlights or as viral videos on news sites or shared by @entity137 friends			1
perhaps , had the internet come along many decades earlier , @entity52 's @entity139 tomahawk throw would have gone viral -- but that 's the only part viewers would have seen			0
the nightly monologues , as comedic currency , have been devalued , and the popularity of a show -- and a host -- can be measured as much today by quick hits of brilliant comedy business rather than a solid hour of entertainment			0
@entity92 , of course , is superb at this game ; his musical bits alone are guaranteed to feed a steady course of streaming videos			0
@entity101 is good at it too , and even the host following @entity3 on @entity71 , @entity157 of " the @entity158 , " has attracted many millions of @entity159 hits with snippets of his antics			0
@entity3 , like @entity163 counterpart @entity162 on @entity165 's " the @entity166 " import , sees his show as a one - hour complete entity			2
that fewer members of his audience are seeing it that way may be the biggest reason he 's leaving			0
if no one is watching tv in real time any more , then what does being a " late - night " host even mean ?			1

@entity3 , who 's retiring in 2015 , has been a talk show host for 33 years
@entity182 says it 's more than @entity92 's " @entity68 " turn
he says many people see late - night shows as short bits or viral videos online the next day
@entity182 : internet age has devalued @entity3 's forte of monologue , *hourlong* show
