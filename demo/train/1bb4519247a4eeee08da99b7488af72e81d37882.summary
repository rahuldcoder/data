the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : let 's start by talking about @entity45 and how you recently donated thousands of books to @entity36 troops			1
@entity1 : books are on the way overseas this week , which is the big subject for me			1
it started in part because a friend of mine , a partner in my entertainment company , was a captain in @entity64 , and his son did a couple of tours in @entity41			2
he 's a bright guy ; he used to send letters home every week and also letters from his friends			1
i read a lot of them , and they were really kind of mind - blowing in terms of just putting you in touch with what it 's like to be a soldier overseas right now			1
it really got me interested			2
if i could , i would like to shake the hands of everybody over there , because i do n't think they get the attention that they should			2
i ca n't do that , so we 're going to put 200,000 books in the hands of thousands of soldiers in @entity41 and @entity42 instead , which i think is a big deal			1
@entity0 : what kind of feedback have you received from @entity36 servicemen and - women for your efforts ? @entity1 : we 've been doing this on a smaller scale for five or six years now , 20 or 30,000 books , so i 've had hundreds and hundreds of letters and ... lots of pictures , with troops saying , ' here i am reading your book in some sort of foxhole or in my truck or jeep or whatever			1
' i also hear from families , people from home saying , ' i got a note from our son , and he talked about getting a couple of your books , ' and that 's very cool			1
@entity0 : you 're also a big believer in getting kids to read			2
@entity1 : it 's a huge thing with me			1
getting the books out , going to schools , talking to kids about how important it is for them to read so that they really become better human beings			2
i think at this stage in our civilization , i think books are probably the best place to get varying points of view on things , understand how other people think and live their lives and have more understanding and compassion for people			2
obviously , if a kid ca n't read well by the time they get out of middle school , most likely they 're going to have problems			2
it 's just so much harder to go through school and get a decent job			0
there are a lot of things we as individuals ca n't do much about			0
we ca n't solve global warming as individuals or health care problems , but as individuals , most of us can get our kids reading			0
@entity1 's recent @entity0 essay on getting your kid to read @entity0 : you have several books on the bestseller list right now , a new novel coming out and a handful of others in the works , plus your other projects			1
so how do you keep up with everything ? @entity1 : oh , yeah , the books , too			1
i do n't feel stressed out			0
it 's just a pattern i am comfortable with			0
i get up every morning and chop wood , and i pretty much do it seven days a week , and i like to do it			2
i still have time for my wife and my son , who 's 14 , and at this point , my head is still above water			0
i think part of it is , you can take on more , and you do , but at a certain point i may say , that 's it			0
i ca n't do anymore			0
i read a fair amount , but i do n't read as much as i used to , so that 's suffered a little			0
@entity0 : you work with a number of co-authors on some of your books			2
how do you divide the workload ? @entity1 : we alternate words			1
actually , i write an outline of about 50 to 60 pages that will lay out every chapter			0
i then ask the co-writer to contribute to the outline			0
i want their opinions , and i want them to feel they 're part of the process right from the get - go			2
then they will write a draft			0
i like to look at things every two weeks			0
that way you can say ' that part 's great ' or ' hold it , let 's talk about this			0
' i was just talking to @entity224 a little while ago ; he and i do the @entity226 books			2
when i have a first draft , then i will do another , and in some cases i 've done , seven , eight , nine drafts			0
and that 's the process			0
i do the outline , the co-writer does the first draft , and i 'll do subsequent drafts			0
although my co-writers might call it ' @entity238 screwing up the book , ' but so far , it 's working well			2
@entity0 : " @entity7 " comes out next week			1
what was the spark behind this book ? @entity1 : i had this idea of four women going off on a cool vacation and getting in big trouble , really big trouble			1
they 're accused of murder in @entity250 , and it 's a huge , huge trial , and i do n't want to give too much away , but i really liked that idea			0
@entity0 : what are you working on next ? @entity1 : there 's the next @entity20 and then a couple of kids books , a follow - up to " @entity29 : the worst years of @entity258			1
" i 'm trying to write books that are really funny but also have things for kids to sink their teeth into and think about			2
i 'm writing one now about middle school and summer camp , and then right around @entity265 , i 'll have a book about a middle school kid who desperately wants to be a stand - up comedian , and he knows every joke in the history of mankind , so that 's kind of a fun one			2
@entity0 : how is the @entity20 movie coming together ? @entity1 : i 've been to two test screenings , and i visited the set , and it 's looking really , really good			1
@entity22 is going to blow everybody 's mind			0
he 's very , very good			0
not that you would n't expect that , but he has n't done this kind of a movie before			0
you 'll see him as a very dramatic , very physical actor			0
also , @entity288 is going to blow people 's minds as the bad guy			0
it 's unusual for a thriller , because it 's both exciting and very emotional			0
i think it 's going to do extremely well			0
@entity0 : how do you come up with all of your story ideas ? @entity1 : sometimes it can just be a title , or i just have a sense that i can build a story around something and i 'm going to like the story			1
i have to feel emotional about it to do it			0
i used to , like a lot of writers , get up at 2:30 in the morning and start scribbling stuff down			0
i 've kind of stopped doing that , because the good ideas i tend to remember			0
i have more than enough ideas right now			0
i have a folder in my office with about 400 ideas in it			0
so it will take me another 40 years to get through those			0
