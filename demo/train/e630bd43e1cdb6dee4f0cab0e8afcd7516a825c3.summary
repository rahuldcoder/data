@entity0 -- 45 years ago , while on patrol in @entity5 's @entity4 , @entity2 was suddenly faced with his own mortality			1
he never heard the explosion that destroyed his legs and left arm , but be clearly saw what had happened to his body			2
" let me die " -- was his immediate reaction			2
but it was his sergeant who reminded him of his family and all he had to live for			0
on sunday in @entity0 , @entity17 was able to thank sgt. @entity18 as he looked out on the only memorial to honor the living disabled veterans of @entity22 's wars			1
the @entity23 , located just blocks from the @entity24 , was dedicated sunday in a ceremony that focused on life after war and the many sacrifices disabled veterans still make			1
president @entity30 spoke at the ceremony of the cost of war and the painful legacy it leaves behind			1
" each of you endured a moment that shaped the arc of your lives and that speaks to our debt as a nation , " @entity30 said			1
" it was the moment that binds each of you forever , that moment of realization that life would not be the same			0
" @entity17 , who served in the @entity49 , was awarded a @entity50 and a @entity51 for his service			0
while recovering , and learning how to function in his new body , @entity17 worried about how his family would react			0
" i ca n't image the fear , the terror , that must have been in my family 's hearts and minds that day they received a telegram explaining the severity of my injuries , " @entity17 told the audience at the memorial 's dedication			0
" trying to think of what to say seeing me for the first time , minus three limbs			0
" the memorial was designed as a space for disabled veterans and those they love to find quiet reflection			0
a ceremonial flame hovers over a reflecting pool , surrounded by granite and glass walls and a grove of trees			0
" what we gave , what our families gave , and what we continue to give , will be forever remembered here in our nation 's capital , " @entity17 said sunday			2
" we are not unique in our story , we are just one example of the thousands of lives affected by the lifelong disabilities that are the terrifying consequences of war			2
" those consequences weigh heavily on the recent maneuvering of @entity24 military operations in the fight against terrorist group @entity101			0
the president 's refusal to send ground troops to the @entity105 was echoed in his comments sunday			1
" let 's never rush into war , because it is @entity22 's sons and daughters who bear the scars of war for the rest of their lives , " he said			2
" let us only send them into harm 's way when it 's absolutely necessary			0
and if we do , let 's always give them the strategy , the mission and the support that they need to get the job done			0
" @entity129 secretary @entity128 and veterans advocate and actor @entity131 -- who played the character of lt. @entity133 in the movie " @entity135 " -- also spoke at the ceremony			0
a long journey @entity138 was visiting the @entity140 memorial when she was first struck by the need for a special place to honor disabled veterans			1
@entity138 saw a veteran in a wheelchair struggling to lay flowers on another veteran 's grave			1
" that was the catalyst that sent me on this 16 - year quest to build this memorial so that our nations disabled veterans could earn the respect and the recognition that they so deserve , " @entity138 said			1
in 1998 @entity138 joined forces with @entity159 , who was the national adjutant for @entity161 at the time			1
the two worked with former va secretary @entity164 to make the memorial a reality			2
" until this day , this very day , we have not remembered those who lived and whose lives were forever changed by the sacrifices they made in uniform , " @entity159 said at the ceremony			1
" without their stories and the experience of their loved ones , we as a people can not know the cost of war			1
" 9 simple ways you can help veterans life after battle for disabled veterans , the end of active military service is not the end of the battle , said @entity138			1
" the cost of war does not end when guns are silenced , for every day disabled veterans continue to battle with their physical and mental disabilities			1
" @entity30 also underscored that not all veterans ' injuries are visible			1
" no matter what war you served in -- and whether they called it ' shell shock ' or ' battle fatigue ' or the ' 1,000 - yard stare ' or post-traumatic stress -- you know that the unseen wounds of war are just as real as any other , and they can hurt just as much , if not more			2
" " you are not alone " although the @entity24 @entity129 has recently admitted to mismanaging the care of veterans , the president emphasized the government 's responsibility to provide care and support			1
" when our wounded veterans set out on that long road of recovery , we need to move heaven and earth to make sure they get every single benefit , every single bit of care that they have earned , that they deserve , " he said			0
@entity30 also spoke of the responsibility ordinary citizens have to honor the sacrifice that veterans have made			1
" if they 're hurting and do n't know if they can go on , we need to say loud and clear , as family and friends , as neighbors and coworkers , as fellow citizens , and as a nation : you are not alone , " @entity30 said			2
" if you 're an @entity22 , and you see a veteran -- maybe with a prosthetic arm or leg , maybe burns on their face -- do n't ever look away , " he said			0
" do not turn away			0
you go up and you reach out , and you shake their hand , and you look them in the eye and you say those words every veteran should hear all the time : ' welcome home , thank you			0
we need you more than ever			0
you help us stay strong , you help us stay free			0
