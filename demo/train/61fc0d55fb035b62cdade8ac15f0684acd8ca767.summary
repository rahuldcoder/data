@entity17 she packed a lot of drama into her 21 years			2
the second daughter of future @entity22 president @entity21 , @entity17 also was the first wife of future @entity24 president @entity23			1
her parents gave her the middle name @entity27 after @entity28 , in pre-state @entity29 , where her military father was stationed and where she was born in 1813 or 1814			2
@entity17 was often called @entity27 or @entity31			2
the life of an army brat was certainly more dangerous in the early 19th century			2
during @entity21 's posting in @entity35 , @entity17 and her two sisters came down with " bilious fever , " now thought to be malaria			1
@entity17 survived , but her older and younger sisters died			2
the @entity40 were stationed at @entity41 ( now @entity42 , @entity43 ) in 1832 , when @entity17 met and fell in love with a young officer named @entity23			2
@entity21 opposed the relationship , and accounts vary as to why -- because he did n't want his daughter to continue to be exposed to the hardships of army life , or because he and @entity23 did n't get along			1
@entity23 was transferred , so he and @entity17 conducted a long - distance relationship for two years			2
they even planned their wedding by mail			2
the ceremony took place in june 1835 , in @entity57 , @entity58			2
@entity17 's parents did not attend			1
once again there is disagreement over why they were absent			2
the newlyweds immediately headed south , and they visited @entity23 's relatives in @entity35			1
@entity17 , mindful of the family tragedy the last time the @entity40 traveled those parts , wrote home , " do not make yourself uneasy about me , the country is quite healthy			0
" but while staying with @entity23 's oldest sister at " @entity72 " in @entity73 , @entity35 , the couple fell ill with malaria			1
@entity23 recovered , but @entity17 died , barely three months into her marriage			0

@entity78 her life straddled the @entity80 of her father , president @entity82 , and the @entity83 , when accomplished women were just beginning to enter in numbers into the mainstream of public life			1
@entity78 was born in 1897 , four years after her father left office			1
a widower with two children by his first wife , @entity82 had married @entity93 , and @entity78 was the couple 's only child			1
she was just 4 when her father , the last of the bearded presidents , passed away			0
if @entity78 's dynastic 1921 marriage to @entity99 -- grandnephew of her father 's secretary of state and onetime @entity103 presidential nominee @entity102 -- was conventional , much of the rest of her life was not			1
by the time of her wedding , she had received several academic degrees , including a law degree from @entity108 , and was admitted to the bar in @entity110 and @entity29 at age 22			0
after her marriage , she began publishing a monthly newsletter , " @entity114			0

she died in 1955 , at the age of 58			0
@entity0 : quiz : post- - @entity77 lives of presidents 3			0
@entity127 thirty years before the @entity128 went to @entity129 to sample and popularize its spiritual wonders , another musician and political activist , @entity127 , had already been			1
it was the final chapter in the peripatetic life of the eldest of president @entity137 's three daughters			1
@entity127 was born in 1886 , in @entity138 , @entity139			0
during her father 's presidency , both of @entity127 's sisters had @entity77 weddings			1
so when their mother died in 1914 , it fell to the unmarried eldest @entity137 sister to become @entity77 hostess			1
the president 's remarriage a year later allowed @entity127 to pursue her passion -- music			1
she studied piano and voice at the @entity156 in @entity157			0

in 1918 , she began nearly a year 's stay in @entity167 , singing before @entity169 troops			1
the experience led to a breakdown , the loss of her singing voice , and the end of her musical career			0
@entity0 : why do we sing the @entity177 at sporting events ? with the war over and women gaining the right to vote , @entity127 became an advocate of a style of local participatory democracy in which neighborhood schools would become community centers			0
the annual $ 2,500 stipend bequeathed by her father upon his death in 1924 was not enough for her live on , so @entity127 entered the advertising business			0

at the ashram she was known as @entity210			0
she died there in 1944 at the age of 57 of uremic poisoning			0
@entity214 probably the only advantage to being the child of one of @entity22 's worst presidents was not having his last name			1
@entity7 had no children with his wife , but a married man with two mistresses is bound to leave a legacy			1

@entity225 died in 1991 , " evidently so forgotten by history that no obituary was published , " the @entity271 later wrote			0
@entity274 the helicopter parent is nothing new			0
but that pesky parental hovering can whip up a lot of dust when @entity280 is straight - talking president @entity281			1
