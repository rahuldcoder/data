tea party groups describe an arduous @entity2 application process for tax - exempt status with probing questions and long delays			1
in addition to standard questions that organizations face when applying for tax - exempt status , a handful of tea party organizations told @entity12 they were asked probing questions about the websites they maintained , literature they use for research and future activities the groups had planned			1
acting commissioner of @entity2 resigns the @entity2 scandal over how it processed tax - exempt applications from tea party and conservative groups has already cost the acting director his job and caused lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to call for an extensive investigation about how the prejudicial screening was allowed to happen			1
many of the tea party groups opted to seek tax - exempt status as social welfare organizations under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) of the federal tax code after the 2010 @entity41 ruling in the @entity43 case			1
that exemption allows groups to fundraise without disclosing donors , but requires that any participation in campaigns of elections must be for the promotion of social welfare			0
@entity52 , executive director of the @entity53 @entity25 , said he first sought 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) tax - exempt status for his group in december 2009			1
the @entity25 group did n't hear from the @entity2 until september of 2010 , when the taxing body had 17 more questions for the group , which @entity52 answered			1
more than a year went by when the @entity2 had another 12 questions for the @entity62 's group in january 2012			2
while he shrugged off the first set as benign , he said he was shocked by the second round			0
in the second set of questions , the @entity2 asked the @entity53 @entity25 to provide " the time , location and detailed description of each event or program " in which the group had " conducted or participated " since october 2010			1
the @entity2 also asked for " copies of handouts " provided to the audience at all of the group 's events since that date			2
@entity52 was most strartled when the @entity2 asked for " copies of your current web pages and your presentations on other web pages such as social networking sites and blog sites			1
" the @entity2 also asked to see private pages that were " accessible only to your members			1
" " we were quite alarmed , " @entity52 said			0
although he admits he only answered part of the questions , @entity52 said his group received its tax - exempt status in july 2012			1
@entity12 reached out to the @entity2 for this story but received no response			2
acting irs commissioner @entity97 resigned over the controversy on wednesday night			0
in a statement , president @entity99 vowed new safeguards to ensure that such targeting is not repeated at the @entity2			2
" @entity103 have a right to be angry about it , and i am angry about it , " he said			0
according to a @entity109 inspector general 's report this week , the @entity2 used keywords that generally applied to conservative and tea party groups in determining whether an application deserved more scrutiny			1
the @entity114 @entity25 is another conservative group that says it received scrutiny similar to that given to other tea party organizations			1
' angry ' @entity99 announces @entity2 leader 's ouster after conservatives targeted documents from march 2012 provided to @entity12 by @entity122 of the @entity114 group shows the @entity2 asked for copies of " the pages " of its website -- including social networking sites -- and a " list " of the group 's " activities to date , " including a description of each event			1
the @entity2 also asked the group to " provide a list of your communication to your members or others , " including speeches , e-mails , flyers , billboards and " other literature			2
" " we did n't know what was going on , " @entity122 said			0
@entity122 said he was so frustrated by the process that he just gave up on the tax application			0
" we took a look at the requested information and basically said there is no possible way that we can reproduce , for example , hard copies of every web page on our site that we had , " @entity122 said			0
" they wanted a hard copy of every piece of literature that we had distributed at a street fair or at a meeting or at an event and quite honestly , we could n't do it			0
" so @entity122 and the @entity114 @entity25 just did n't respond to the inquiry			1
" we just said fine , we will file as a different organization , " @entity122 said			0
even though the group failed to respond to the questions , the @entity114 @entity25 received a letter from the @entity2 office in @entity170 that its tax - exempt status was approved on february 22 , 2012			1
" do i have confidence in this organization			0
the answer is no , " @entity122 said , confused as to how he was approved after he did n't answer their questions			0
read @entity2 watchdog 's report a number of other tea party organizations tell similar stories			1
" they wanted us to predict the future , like asking us in the future what kind of events we would hold , taking part of and how much money we would spend on those events in the future , " @entity182 , president of the @entity183 told @entity12			2
@entity182 said the questions she was asked were similar to those asked of the other tea party groups -- the @entity2 asked about her website , events she had participated in and any connections she had with elected officials in her area			1
" we called the @entity2 and we asked them , ' ok , can you tell us what , first of all , ' close relationships ' means , ' " @entity182 said about her call with the @entity2			2
" my state rep is also my dogs ' veterinarian			0
is that something that you want ? " like other groups , @entity182 said she did her best to answer all the questions but eventually just sent incomplete responses to the @entity2			2
" these questions are impossible to answer , " @entity182 said			0
" we felt that they were trying to bury us in paperwork so that it would be more difficult to comply and get our status			0
" like other groups , @entity182 eventually sent incomplete answers to the @entity2			0
if we had done everything they wanted , " it would have taken a u-haul truck , " @entity182 joked			0
the @entity183 received its tax - exempt status in march , 2013			1
the @entity2 has identified two " rogue " employees in the agency 's @entity170 office as being principally responsible for the " overly aggressive " handling of requests by conservative groups for tax - exempt status , a congressional source told @entity12			1
@entity243 , co-founder and chairman of the @entity246 9/12 project , a conservative group that applied to tax - exempt status in 2010 , said his organization also experienced similar scrutiny			1
in august of 2010 , @entity243 said the @entity2 sent him a similar letter to other groups and asked for " screen shots of website pages " and " what research material we have used to develop our materials when we were conducting our meetings			2
" " our only concern was that we comply with the law , we had no reason to suspect anything was amiss at that point , " @entity243 said			0
" obviously in hindsight , we know that not to be the case			0
" for a group of people that was already deeply skeptical of government , his encounter with the @entity2 validated his mistrust of the government			2
" at this point now , the question for us is now we know you have been lying about everything else , " @entity243 said			0
" what else has been going on that we did n't know of ? " opinion : @entity2 abuses power			0
