the @entity3 police continue to use a " degrading " invasive physical test to check for female recruits virginity , a @entity1 report has claimed			1
a manual examination is used to physically check for an intact hymen in the recruits , the report alleges			0
it is , according to the report , a long - standing part of the health check that women must undergo to be accepted onto the force			0
while the virginity test is not specifically part of the required " obstetrics and gynecology " examination that female recruits are required to undergo to gain entry to the @entity22 , senior female officers told the report 's authors that it has long been part of the process			1
virginity a requirement the @entity22 website lists the health requirements for female recruits , listing virginity as one of the requirements			1
" in addition to the other medical and physical examinations			0
women who want to become policewomen are to undergo a virginity test			1
policewomen must keep their virginity , " the informational page states			0
it ends the section with a cheery " thank you " and a smiley - face emoticon			0
married women are not eligible to apply for service in the police force			0
police : exams applicable to both sexes a police spokesperson told @entity53 that all recruits , not only female , were subject to thorough medical tests that included examination of genitalia			1
" overall , the medical and physical examination has two main objectives			0
the first one is to make sure that the candidates ' health and physical condition will not harm them when admitted into police force , " spokesperson @entity61 said			0
" secondly , it is to make sure that they do not possess any communicable diseases that will not allow them to perform maximally as trained police personnel , " he said			0
" as to the examination of the virginity , it is just a part of the whole medical and physical test , not intended to solely seek for the virginity condition			2
or it can not be put in a perspective for the sake of finding out the virginity , instead , it is for the sake of the completeness of medical and physical examination			2
" @entity61 also said that the @entity1 report was incomplete because it had not sought comment from police medical authorities			1
' discriminatory , cruel , degrading ' @entity1 says they interviewed several female officers and applicants , as well as police medical and recruitment staff			1
they also say they spoke with a @entity93 member			0
the officers and recruits who had undergone the test called it " painful " and " traumatic			1
" the report describes the test , administered by @entity100 and @entity101 staff in police hospitals in the cities of @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110 , as " discriminatory , cruel ( and ) degrading			2
" one recruit interviewed by @entity1 for the report said : " entering the virginity test examination room was really upsetting			1
i feared that after they performed the test i would not be a virgin anymore			0
my friend even fainted because ... it really hurt , really hurt			0
" @entity1 called the test " subjective and unscientific			1
" " the @entity22 's use of ' virginity tests ' is a discriminatory practice that harms and humiliates women , " said @entity120 , associate women 's rights director at @entity1 in a statement			1
" police authorities in @entity106 need to immediately and unequivocally abolish the test , and then make certain that all police recruiting stations nationwide stop administering it			0
" outside condemnation women 's rights advocates have corroborated the @entity1 reports ' findings			2
" over the last 12 years , i have been visited by many police women complaining about virginity tests conducted by police department , with some of them ( saying ) they have suffered from trauma having conducted the test , because they felt painful and they felt ashamed of being tested			1
the trauma lasts even until now , " @entity142 , of @entity107 based women 's crisis center @entity143 , told @entity53			0
" we protest this virginity test , which is now disguised under the name ' medical and physical examination ' ... virginity tests ( are ) one of the forms of sexual violence , and therefore a human rights violation			1
we demand an end to this practice			0
" reform attempts insufficient attempts to reform the physical and abolish the " archaic " test , @entity1 says , have failed and the use of the test still widespread			2
the group says virginity tests contradict internationally - agreed human rights standards			2
the rights organization has also cataloged similar abuses by police in several other countries including @entity170 , @entity171 , and @entity172 , and has previously spoken out against virginity tests for @entity3 schoolgirls			1
@entity1 say the report is counterproductive to the @entity3 government 's aim to recruit more women to the police force			2
" so - called virginity tests are discriminatory and a form of gender - based violence -- not a measure of women 's eligibility for a career in the police , " @entity120 said			1
" this pernicious practice not only keeps able women out of the police , but deprives all @entity3 of a police force with the most genuinely qualified officers			0

@entity1 condemns invasive virginity test for female police recruits
officers and recruits who had undergone the test called it " painful " and " traumatic "
