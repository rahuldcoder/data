@entity0 , @entity1 -- the captain of the shipwrecked cruise liner @entity5 faced a closed - door hearing monday over whether he should remain under house arrest			1
@entity8 faces possible charges of manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning ship after the vessel struck rocks and rolled onto its side in the waters off the @entity18 island of @entity19 on january 13			1
sixteen bodies have been recovered , and 16 people remain missing from the roughly 4,200 people who were aboard the cruise liner			1
one of @entity24 's lawyers , @entity25 , said the defense team was " optimistic " that he would be freed from house arrest			1
" we do n't think that any of the ( justifications ) for @entity24 's house arrest are valid			1
he is not going to escape or to repeat the crime , " @entity25 said			0
prosecutor @entity33 did not speak to reporters as he entered or left the court			2
prosecutors want @entity24 's house arrest revoked and the captain sent back to jail to await trial			1
by law , the three - judge panel has three days to reach a verdict on house arrest			0
in his answers to prosecutors , defense attorneys and a judge investigating the case last month , @entity24 admitted he made a " mistake " in striking the rocks			1
" i hit this projection of rock that seems almost stuck into the ship , but this was my mistake , " @entity24 said , according to a 126 - page transcript			1
" ... there is n't anything i can say , as i was convinced that passing within .28 of a mile there would n't be any problem			0
" the captain also brushed aside suggestions that at 15 knots , he was going too fast , as alleged by prosecutors			2
" there is n't a speed limit , " he said			0
" ... we had more or less the speed needed to reach @entity69 on time			0
" according to the transcript , @entity24 said he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking			1
" this is what allowed me to limit the tilting , " he said			0
maritime lawyer @entity76 said the maneuver is " fairly standard " in the case of a ship taking on water and in danger of sinking or capsizing			2
" the best thing to do is to put it aground to stop it sinking			0
" but in statements made during a phone conversation with a friend , @entity24 said managers pressured him to steer the ship to the area where the collision occurred , two @entity18 newspapers reported wednesday			1
@entity94 and @entity95 published excerpts from a telephone conversation @entity24 had with a friend after his january 14 arrest			1
the captain called his friend from the prosecutor 's office , and authorities tapped the phone , the newspapers said			2
" in my place , someone else would n't have been so benevolent to have gone right under there , because they have pissed me off , go , go there , " @entity24 said , in an apparent reference to getting close to the island , according to the newspapers			1
" the shallows were there , but it was n't signaled by the instruments that i had , and i went through ... in order to follow what the managers wanted			0
" @entity24 attorney @entity121 confirmed the wiretap but would not comment on the conversation			2
the information should not have been published , he said , as it is part of the investigation			0
the man behind the steering wheel , @entity126 , told investigators that after the ship struck the rocks , @entity24 cursed and said he had not seen them , @entity94 reported			1
both @entity131 and authorities have criticized @entity24 's behavior			2
@entity131 can not conduct an independent investigation because prosecutors seized the ship 's data recorder			2
the recorder had some connection problems but is working , @entity131 chief executive @entity138 has said			0
it contains conversation recordings and navigation system data , he said			0
cruise ship passengers described a scene of panic and confusion as they rushed for lifeboats			2
some said the crew seemed overwhelmed and did not have accurate information on what was taking place			0
in the transcript , @entity24 also described the chaos , saying that he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship			1
he said he was trying to launch a lifeboat when he realized he was no longer on board			2
" i was then on the lifeboat			0
it is n't as if i had boarded it , " he said			0
" look , i fell on its roof			0
" however , in the wiretapped conversation , @entity24 told the friend , " when i understood that the ship was tilting , i decided to leave , and left , " according to @entity95			1
a captain 's leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend , said @entity18 criminal defense attorney @entity174 , who does not represent @entity24			1
" this is a very difficult position because our law is very strong , and the risk is very high for the captain , " who could face a 15 - year jail sentence , @entity174 said			0
@entity2 's @entity181 and @entity182 in @entity183 contributed to this report .			0
