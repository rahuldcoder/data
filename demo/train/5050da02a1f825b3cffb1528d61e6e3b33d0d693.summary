@entity0 -- the nuclear crisis at the @entity5 power plant in @entity6 was a " man - made disaster " that unfolded as a result of collusion between the facility 's operator , regulators and the government , an independent panel said in an unusually frank report thursday			1
the report by the @entity16 outlines errors and willful negligence at the plant before the earthquake and tsunami that devastated swaths of northeastern @entity6 on march 11 last year , and a flawed response in the hours , days and weeks that followed			1
it also offers recommendations and encourages the nation 's parliament to " thoroughly debate and deliberate " the suggestions			2
the crippled @entity5 plant spewed radiation and displaced tens of thousands of residents from the surrounding area in the worst nuclear accident since the @entity35 in @entity36			1
commissioned by the national parliament , the panel 's report tellingly blames @entity6 culture for the fundamental causes of the disaster			1
as well as detailing the specific failings related to the accident , the report describes a @entity6 in which nuclear power became " an unstoppable force , immune to scrutiny by civil society			1
" " its regulation was entrusted to the same government bureaucracy responsible for its promotion , " the commission said			0
@entity5 plant operator : we were n't prepared for nuclear accident contradicting claims by @entity59 , or @entity59 , the operator of the plant , the report said that " the direct causes of the accident were all foreseeable prior to march 11 , 2011			1
" the operator , regulators and the government " failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements -- such as assessing the probability of damage , preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster , and developing evacuation plans , " the commission said			1
following the quake and tsunami , the lack of training and knowledge of the @entity59 workers at the facility reduced the effectiveness of the response to the situation at a critical time , according to the report			0
as the crisis escalated , @entity59 , the regulators , government agencies and the prime minister 's office were ineffective in " preventing or limiting the consequential damage " at @entity5 , the commission said			1
the prime minister 's office did n't promptly declare a state of emergency , the commission noted			0
and chains of command were disrupted amid the crisis , creating confusion , it said			0
meanwhile , communication failures about critical decisions undermined trust between the different parties			0
the report 's authors -- led by @entity106 , a former president of the @entity107 of @entity6 -- attributed the failings at the plant before and after march 11 specifically to @entity6 culture			1
" what must be admitted -- very painfully -- is that this was a disaster ' made in @entity6 , ' " the report said			2
" its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of @entity6 culture : our reflexive obedience ; our reluctance to question authority ; our devotion to ' sticking with the program			1
' " @entity5 residents call for criminal charges against nuclear officials suggesting that the mind - set that supported the negligence at @entity5 " can be found across @entity6 , " @entity106 also urged citizens to " reflect on our responsibility as individuals in a democratic society			2
" the commission made a series of recommendations to try to avoid a repeat of the catastrophe , calling for the overhaul of @entity59 and the nuclear regulators			1
it urged the establishment of a permanent parliamentary committee to deal with nuclear power and supervise regulators			2
a " fundamental re-examination of the crisis management system " was suggested			0
the report called for measures tackling public health and welfare issues , including the establishment of a system " to deal with long - term public health effects , " monitoring " hot spots " and " the spread of radioactive contamination			0
" it called for starting " a detailed and transparent program of decontamination and relocation			0
" @entity160 's suicide sad reminder how @entity5 continues to claim victims a system of independent investigation commissions dealing with nuclear issues should be developed , it said			2
the report comes at a delicate time for the @entity6 nuclear sector			1
this week , the first reactor to be switched on since the @entity5 disaster came back online			0
all 50 commercial nuclear reactors in @entity6 had been offline since may 5 for safety checks			2
the restart of the no. 3 reactor at the @entity175 , which serves western @entity6 , prompted protests by anti-nuclear activists			2
@entity59 admitted last month that it was not fully prepared for the nuclear disaster			0
the company 's final report on the disaster said it did not have sufficient measures to prevent the accident			0
it also acknowledged criticism that @entity59 took too long to disclose information			0
on thursday , the company declined to comment on the independent commission 's report			0
the @entity6 government has approved plans effectively to nationalize @entity59 with a $ 12.5 billion capital injection to save it from bankruptcy			1
though no deaths have been attributed to the nuclear accident , the earthquake and tsunami killed more than 15,000 people in northeastern @entity6			2
@entity6 once again getting power from nuclear energy there have been several investigations into the @entity5 disaster			1
in december , a government - formed panel of investigators released an interim report saying poorly trained operators misread a key backup system and waited too long to start pumping water into overheating reactor units			0
the government 's 10 - member panel , led by @entity216 engineering professor @entity215 , also said neither @entity59 nor government regulators were prepared for the chance that a tsunami could trigger a nuclear disaster			1
that panel is due to deliver its final report at the end of july			0
" we would like to take a good look into both reports and take appropriate measures , " chief cabinet secretary @entity224 said at a news conference thursday , referring to the parliament - commissioned report and the government - requested report			0
former @entity6 leader : ' i felt fear ' during nuclear crisis			1

new : the report makes recommendations to avoid a repeat of the 2011 catastrophe
the report criticizes the plant 's operator , regulators and the @entity6 government
it attributes the cause of the failings to @entity6 's culture of " reflexive obedience "
it is one of several investigations into the nuclear crisis that displaced thousands
