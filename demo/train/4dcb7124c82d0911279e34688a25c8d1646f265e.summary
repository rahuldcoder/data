-- coming home from @entity3 , @entity1 is obviously going through another rough patch in his presidency			1
but this time , it could be more dangerous : he is perilously close to becoming a lame duck 33 months before he leaves office			1
that is bad for him , bad for the country and bad for the world			2
the second term of a presidency often follows an arc			1
as @entity19 told his aides after his landslide victory in 1964 , you 've got about a year to get things done at home			2
and second - term presidents have often seized on those early months for domestic accomplishments			1
after that , @entity26 becomes mired in midterm politicking , and in your third year , people start looking over your shoulder at who is coming next			2
with power seeping away at home , second - termers increasingly turn their attention overseas , where they can still get big things done as commander in chief of the most powerful nation in history			1
that 's why presidents spend so much time on the road in their final years			1
@entity1 's second term is a total aberration			1
resisted by obstructionists among @entity48 and plagued by his own mistakes , the first 12 months after re-election were a bust			1
why he and his team did n't take more care in the rollout of the @entity57 website will remain one of the great mysteries for historians			2
but it has now become equally puzzling why he has not become more sure - footed in foreign affairs			2
he is one of the brightest men ever to occupy the office , and yet his learning curve has been among the flattest			0
talking to players on the world stage -- most of whom still want him to succeed -- one finds them genuinely rattled , worried about a lack of national will and operational competence			0
on the tail end of his @entity3 trip , @entity1 told the press that in foreign policy , he thinks a president hits mostly singles and doubles and an occasional home run			1
it was odd enough that given his huge power and influence , he thinks small ball			0
but he also raised the question : why so long between home runs ? when was the last one ? three years ago with @entity87 ? not to overdo his analogy , but the years since have brought a notable string of strikeouts			0
the administration would vigorously disagree , but just how much success can it genuinely claim in @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 or even @entity96 ? or the @entity98 reset ? @entity99 ? the administration 's increasing focus on @entity3 is a welcome move , but it too has gone less well than expected			2
experts have long said that much of the success of the famous " pivot " will depend upon completion of the @entity107 , the most important trade agreement in decades			0
to its credit , the administration has aggressively pursued the deal but to little avail			0
the president 's trip to @entity115 revealed that the partnership is in serious trouble , mired down by domestic politics in both the @entity119 and @entity120			1
@entity1 did provide much - needed assurances to @entity120 about @entity119 credibility as a military ally			1
still , the facts remain that even as the @entity119 cuts defense spending , @entity125 is boosting its defense budget by 12 % and flexing its muscles off its shores			0
with nationalism on the rise across @entity3 and sparks starting to fly , who can be certain that @entity119 will be there to put out a fire ? the net result is of a president who sadly seems diminished both at home and abroad			2
he appears to have only minimal objectives with the current @entity140 -- passage of a higher minimum wage and pieces of an immigration bill -- and may not get either			0
most @entity119 still want him to succeed , but when television executives put him on the air , audiences often melt away			0
even before the midterms , voters are looking over his shoulder at who comes next			0
" waiting for @entity155 " is a bigger story than " what happened to @entity1 ? " and there are few prospects for home runs overseas			1
this is bad news and not just for the president 's personal fortunes			1
@entity119 needs a strong , effective president year in , year out , to help propel us forward			1
our success as a people has depended on our capacity to solve the problems of today so we can move on to tomorrow			0
the endless evasions and diversions are tying us in knots and draining our spirits			0
the world needs strong , effective @entity119 leadership as well ; for all our mistakes like @entity96 , the @entity119 is the one nation that still has the power to keep world order			2
but in the twinkle of an eye , we have gone from being indispensable to indisposed			0
there is no obvious game plan for @entity1 to bounce back			1
it would help if he and his team promised less and delivered more			0
it would help if more republicans put the country first			0
the @entity186 must also avoid the clear danger of so eagerly wanting a big breakthrough -- say , in negotiations with @entity190 -- that it weakens our security			0
no deal is always better than a bad deal			0
but mostly , the @entity1 team probably has to be patient			1
fresh opportunities for leadership will come ; they always do at the @entity186			0
and for all his troubles , the president retains enormous powers and public good will			2
it is in not in our national interest to have a lame duck for 33 months .			1

@entity207 : @entity1 is experiencing another low point in his presidency
he says there 's a risk @entity1 could be seen as a lame duck for next 33 months
@entity207 : a second - term president still can be a strong leader , particularly overseas
he says @entity1 should n't diminish the *potential* impact of his *decisions*
