@entity0 -- @entity5 's @entity4 has taken command of @entity5 naval operations in the @entity8 , the @entity3 military has revealed			1
an @entity5 sailor monitors a @entity4 missile test in the @entity8 in 2006			2
that means @entity3 naval forces are operating in the same waters as an organization the @entity3 considers a major supporter of terrorist activity			1
adm. @entity17 , chairman of the @entity18 , made the disclosure wednesday at the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , where he was answering questions from military students			0
afterward , in a written statement , the @entity32 in @entity33 said , " based on activities observed in the @entity8 over the past several months , it appears the @entity5 navy has shifted its patrol areas to the @entity28 and @entity29 -- leaving the @entity4 navy to provide the primary @entity5 naval presence in the @entity8			1
" the move is of concern to the @entity38 , which has long viewed the @entity4 's forces as more antagonistic than @entity5 's regular navy			1
@entity17 said @entity5 made a " strategic decision " in recent months to " essentially give the entire @entity8 to the @entity4 over the next four or five years			2
" " that 's a big deal , because i think part of the leading - edge challenge with @entity5 is the @entity4 specifically , " @entity17 said			1
for the past several months , @entity4 forces have occupied a sunken barge and crane near @entity49 oil terminals at the northern end of the @entity8			1
the @entity4 is using the site as an observation post for the area , which is patrolled regularly by @entity3 and coalition naval forces			2
@entity17 's comments reflect the chairman 's concern about not just @entity5 's nuclear program , but also its arms shipments to @entity49 and @entity61 and statements against @entity63 , a senior @entity38 official said			1
the @entity3 has long said it believes the @entity4 is behind those arms shipments , but it has stopped short of saying the central government of @entity5 is responsible for those actions			1
@entity4 forces earlier this year seized a group of @entity69 sailors at the northern end of the @entity8 and held them for several days			2
the @entity69 had been conducting a boarding of a merchant vessel , as part of an approved coalition operation in the @entity8			0
since that incident , security measures for boarding parties have been stepped up , a senior @entity38 official said			0
new procedures during all boardings include flying an armed helicopter overhead and having an armed vessel close by			0
a @entity38 official in the region said that operations in proximity to @entity5 's regular navy have been " formal and correct , " but added that @entity4 forces " rarely respond " to @entity38 attempts at ship - to - ship communications with them			1
several @entity38 officials said the move is militarily significant for the @entity3 because of the @entity4 's terrorist affiliation			1
@entity38 ships would not want @entity4 vessels sailing too close to them because of that concern , they said			0
one official said @entity5 's regular naval forces evoke less concern because they " represent a nation state			1
" the @entity4 was formed in 1979			0
under @entity5 's constitution , the corps ' task is to protect the revolution , which generally means that it makes sure that domestic forces do n't threaten the theocratic state , said analyst @entity108 of the @entity109			2
the center is a government - funded think tank for the @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115			0
in contrast , the conventional forces are tasked with protecting the country 's borders and guaranteeing its security			0
the naval move " makes perfect sense , " @entity108 said in a telephone interview			0
in recent years , the @entity5 military has recognized that , in a toe - to - toe fight with the @entity3 military , " they 'd get squashed , " @entity108 said			2
in response , it has been focusing more on alternative tactics , in which the @entity4 excel , such as setting mine fields and using large numbers of small boats either packed with explosives or manned by personnel carrying rocket - propelled grenade launchers			0
the thinking is that at least one would be able to get close enough to a large enemy military vessel to attack it , @entity108 said			0
" @entity5 is trying to send a signal that it is ready for any military eventuality and that it is prepared to defend itself aggressively , " he said			0
but the move could backfire by driving @entity5 's @entity8 neighbors into the arms of the @entity3 , which has guaranteed the security of @entity148 states in the @entity8 for decades , @entity108 said			1
