@entity0 -- @entity0 's @entity3 archbishop announced friday that five priests will not be reinstated following a church investigation into accusations of child sex abuse , though the men have a right to an appeal			1
the church also determined that three suspended clergymen are now considered " suitable for ministry , " while the findings of its investigation into 17 others would not be announced until a later date , archbishop @entity11 told reporters			1
dozens of priests were placed on administrative leave after the release of a 2011 grand jury report that blamed the @entity25 for failing to prevent the sexual abuse of children			0
" i 've been in @entity0 for less than a year , and i 've tried as quickly as possible to understand all of the many issues facing our local church , " @entity11 said friday			1
" during that time , dealing with sexual abuse and protecting children has been , and will remain , a top priority for me and for this archdiocese			0
" he said that of those remaining 17 church investigations , six have not yet been cleared by law enforcement , which prevents a church probe from being initiated			2
two others have only recently been cleared , while the findings of the remaining nine clergy members will soon be announced			1
attorney @entity43 , who is representing one of the alleged victims , told @entity1 that the archdiocese said a clergyman accused of sexually abusing his client will not be reinstated			0
the accused clergyman -- whom @entity1 is not currently naming -- was among those suspended after the grand jury report			2
that report led to the @entity0 district attorney 's office charging four priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care			1
monsignor @entity60 , once a longtime supervisor of @entity0 priests , is suspected of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children			2
from 1992 until 2004 , @entity60 was responsible for investigating reports that priests had sexually abused children			0
he has pleaded not guilty , and he has said through his attorneys that he reported those allegations of sex abuse			0
the landmark case is unusual because the charges go beyond accusations against priests and include a church higher - up charged with covering up the abuse -- a move analysts say is unprecedented in the @entity78			0
with nearly 1.5 million members , the @entity25 is one of the largest in the nation			0
priests , particularly those in high - ranking positions , have an exceptional amount of power within the @entity87 , especially in @entity0 because of the church 's deep roots in the community .			1

new : the five men have a right to an appeal , @entity0 's @entity3 archbishop says
new : the investigation found 3 suspended clergymen are now considered " suitable for ministry "
new : results of the findings about 17 others will be announced later
