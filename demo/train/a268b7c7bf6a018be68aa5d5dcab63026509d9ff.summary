-- the historic measure to regulate and tax marijuana in @entity3 deserves to be looked at closely as a model of how legalization ought to be designed and implemented elsewhere in @entity6			1
we 've turned a significant corner with the approval of @entity10 , which purposefully offers a true public health alternative to the criminal prohibition of pot. for the first time in a very long time , the well - intended but failed criminal penalties to protect public health and safety will be set aside			1
adults who choose to use marijuana and obtain it through legal outlets will no longer be faced with the threat of criminal sanctions			2
people of color will no longer face the egregious inequities in how marijuana criminal penalties are imposed			2
parents , as they help prepare their children for the choices they face concerning marijuana , will no longer be hobbled by misinformation about the drug and the absence of effective supports to encourage abstinence			2
" the great experiment " of alcohol prohibition became the national law in 1920			2
its intentions were good , but it failed in a number of vitally important ways			2
in 1923 , the state of @entity47 repealed its alcohol prohibition law			1
ten other states soon followed , and in 1933 national prohibition ended			0
i believe @entity3 has just played that pivotal role with regard to marijuana			1
moreover , by borrowing from public health model principles known to be effective , the state has offered the most compelling replacement to prohibition considered to date			1
what is a public health model ? in brief , it 's an approach that acknowledges use of marijuana can present harms to the user and to public safety , and includes provisions to prevent or ameliorate those harms			1
a public health model includes six key elements			0
@entity3 's new law incorporates each of them			1
the first is accountable oversight by an agency of government			0
the @entity3 legalization model assigns responsibility to a state agency for writing regulations concerning how the growing , producing and selling of marijuana will occur			1
among those regulations are tight limitations on advertising and the prevention of access to marijuana by minors			0
then , that agency will have the authority to issue licenses to growers , producers and sellers and to enforce adherence to the rules			0
the second element is a well - funded multifaceted marijuana education program that is based on science rather than ideology			1
far too few @entity6 are sufficiently informed about marijuana 's effects on health and behavior , both the positive and the negative			1
a key to good decision - making is possessing accurate information			1
the third element is well - funded prevention programs widely available to all the state 's geographical and demographic communities			1
we 've learned a great deal about what knowledge , skills and community supports actually work in helping young people navigate a world in which drugs such as marijuana are readily available			0
sadly , far too little funding has been devoted to putting such programs to work in our communities			0
a fourth element is making treatment of marijuana dependence readily available			1
the new law dedicates funding to establish a statewide @entity133			0
it also earmarks funding to state , county and local governments for the provision of services for those in need of help			0
evaluation of the new law 's impact is the fifth element			0
an independent state agency will receive funding to conduct periodic assessments of how the new system affects behaviors , attitudes and knowledge			0
using the findings of these evaluative studies , the state agency overseeing the pricing and taxing of marijuana can adjust those costs to maximize undercutting of the black market and deterrence of youth access to marijuana			2
the sixth element is research			0
the new law earmarks funding to the state 's two major research universities for the purpose of conducting marijuana - focused studies			1
as we gradually learn how to live more healthfully and safely with marijuana , the knowledge derived from those studies will inform education , prevention , treatment and refinements in the law			0
in more than 40 years of research -- primarily marijuana dependence counseling interventions for adults and adolescents -- it has seemed to me that prohibition has hindered more than it has helped good decision - making			1
far too many teens think smoking pot is " no big deal , " greatly underestimating the risk of being derailed from social , psychological and educational attainment			0
far too many adults do n't take seriously enough the risk of marijuana dependence that accompanies very frequent use			0
by regulating and taxing marijuana based on a set of strong public health principles , i believe our cultural norms concerning marijuana will shift and the harms we 've witnessed will greatly reduce			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2
