@entity0 -- the threat of publication of thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables by a muckraker website has prompted a massive review of documents at @entity3 embassies around the world , a @entity3 official says			1
the official , who was not authorized to comment on the record , tells @entity1 that the @entity13 has , for months , been intensively dealing with the potential impact of the release of documents that @entity17 just recently hinted it will publish			2
the documents are believed to include hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of diplomatic reporting cables from around the world from between 2006 and 2009 , the official said			1
in october , @entity17 released nearly 400,000 @entity3 military reports about operations in @entity23			1
in july , it released more than 70,000 reports from the war in @entity26			2
" next release is 7 [ times ] the size of the @entity33 , " the @entity17 stated in a posting on its @entity29 page on november 21			2
" intense pressure over it for months			0
" the @entity13 has directed every diplomatic mission in the world to analyze cables issued from their locations during that period and to highlight those cables that might contain material sensitive enough to harm the relationship with the host country or put in danger the lives of any sources of information			1
the @entity13 website lists 297 embassies , consulates and diplomatic missions			1
the source says the concern is that the @entity17 release could undermine the @entity3 all over the world			1
honest diplomatic reporting is essential , the official says , and the leaks could hurt that , as well as compromise traditional diplomatic sources			1

for example , @entity70 , the @entity3 ambassador to @entity71 , has called foreign minister @entity73 to inform him of the matter , said @entity75 , a @entity71 @entity76 spokesman			1
the @entity71 embassy in @entity0 is working with the @entity13 , he said			0
the @entity78 also is concerned about the newest release			0
officials there expect the documents to be released soon , possibly by the end of the week			1
the agency is increasing the size of a task force assigned to comb through the records of the already - leaked documents regarding the wars in @entity26 and @entity23			2
if the new documents are published as threatened , the @entity78 team will help assess how damaging they are to @entity3 interests			1
