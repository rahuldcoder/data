-- accused of being too soft on racism in the past , @entity3 football 's governing body @entity1 has vowed to crack down hard on offenders -- with 10 - match bans for players and officials found guilty			1
this year both @entity1 and world governing body @entity9 have come under pressure following @entity13 forward @entity14 's decision to walk off the field in a match against @entity19 fourth tier side @entity18 in january after suffering racist abuse from the crowd			1
" it 's still a scourge on the game , " @entity1 general secretary @entity22 told the @entity24 event , where leading football officials are meeting , in @entity26 , @entity27			1
" we have to have sanctions			0
" what we are proposing is that if a player or official is found guilty then they will be suspended for 10 matches			1
" with several racist incidents making headlines in the past calendar year , @entity1 is also prepared to punish supporters ' racist behavior by closing sections of football grounds -- or , if need be , all of the stadium -- in cases of persistent fan abuse			1
" if supporters are found guilty then there will be a partial closure of the stadium , " added @entity22			1
" this means the section where the offense took place will be closed			0
if there is a second offense by the club 's supporters there will be full closure with a minimum $ 65,400 fine			2
" however , @entity22 said @entity1 would not be taking any action against @entity64 despite the furious reaction of club owner and the @entity69 club 's coach in the wake of their team 's @entity72 defeat in @entity74 on tuesday			2
@entity75 , angered by two late goals his team conceded in the 3 - 2 defeat by @entity78 -- one of which appeared to be offside -- said on @entity81 that the club 's quarterfinal exit was " injustice and racism			2
" coach @entity86 added : " the third goal was an offside goal and there were all kinds of elbows and punches			0
" but @entity22 said : " @entity1 is not taking any action against any club from that point of view			2
i can understand that when you lose a match in the 93rd minute , emotions come up and you say things you do n't really think			0
" @entity1 will vote on its new racism proposals in @entity100 in may and if they are passed , the ruling could apply to all @entity1 competitions from as early as july			0
@entity1 's governing body has also asked its member associations to apply this new anti-racist strategy to their own domestic competitions , with the plans going to a vote of the @entity1 congress in may			2
football 's soul turning to the " cancer " of match - fixing , as @entity22 put it , @entity1 's general secretary characterized the problem as one that affected mainly " lower division " football despite concerns it is taking place in top matches			1
in february @entity123 , director of @entity3 law enforcement agency @entity124 , revealed the crime fighting organization believed the highest levels of the game were no longer safe from match - fixing			1
a total of 380 games in @entity1 -- including @entity131 and @entity133 qualifiers -- were deemed suspicious by @entity124 , with 425 match and club officials and criminals involved from 15 different countries			2
" we knew about these ( @entity124 ) cases before , " said @entity22			0
" we had already taken sanctions against these cases before , our associations had already taken sanctions and banned players and officials			0
" we are monitoring 32,000 matches across 365 days a year every year			0
" " looking at the figures , we can see that some 0.7 % of matches , mainly in lower divisions , present some irregularities , not necessarily match - fixing			1
" the result of matches is the soul of football , and we can not allow anyone to attack the soul of football			0
" but @entity22 acknowledged that @entity1 could not tackle the problem match - fixing on its own and that a more co-ordinated approach was needed			1
" we need the help of governments and law - enforcement agencies , because there is no way we can start looking into bank accounts or tapping phones			0
we need the authorities to help us			0
" what is behind match - fixing is not to fix the match , why would you fix a match in the third division in @entity175 ? " it 's because there is organized crime behind this , and organized crime is financing drugs and prostitution			1
" that is why the authorities have to intervene and have to help us			0

@entity1 wants 10 - match bans for players and officials found guilty of racist behavior
" it 's still a scourge on the game , " said @entity1 general secretary @entity22 .
@entity1 also proposes the closure or partial closure of stadiums
