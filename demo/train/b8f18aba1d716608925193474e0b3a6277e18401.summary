it 's one of the biggest sporting events on the planet and in a growing market for new fans , football 's global governing body has cut a media rights deal for the @entity9 over a decade ahead of the tournament			1
@entity11 extended its @entity13 media rights agreements -- handing @entity14 the @entity16 deal and @entity18 's @entity17 the @entity20 language rights -- for an event in which the 2026 host nation has still to be determined			1
" these agreements guarantee wide distribution for @entity11 tournaments across the @entity30 and @entity31 , " said @entity23 of tv @entity24 in a statement			1
" together , we will be able to further promote football in @entity13 and build on the impressive interest shown by audiences in these major territories during the 2014 @entity37			0
" just days after the @entity38 sold domestic television rights for over $ 8 billion for the three seasons from 2016 , @entity11 declined to detail what the latest @entity13 deal was worth			2
football 's world governing body also refused to comment when asked if it had received sealed bids from rival broadcasters			1
neither @entity47 nor @entity48 responded to a @entity2 email asking if they had bid for the @entity16 language rights			0
that raises the question as to whether @entity14 , which already had agreements in place for the 2018 and 2022 editions following a $ 425 million deal signed in 2011 , won the latest contract without any competition			2
the @entity30 broadcaster has been outspoken over @entity11 's plans to move the @entity61 to the @entity63 winter because of fears over the intense heat during the @entity67 state 's summer months			1
while a working party is expected to recommend suitable dates for the 2022 tournament on february 23 , a switch to winter would play havoc with the @entity30 sporting schedule			2
" you go into buying a @entity9 and you believe it 's going to be in the same time frame it 's always been , " @entity75 president @entity74 said last year			2
" clearly in @entity13 there 's much more competition for ratings points			0
" a move to winter would be bad news for @entity14 given it could clash with the @entity87 playoffs and potentially the @entity88			0
some media commentators have suggested @entity14 was awarded the latest deal on the proviso that it will not make a complaint when the 2022 tournament is shifted to the @entity63 winter			1
potentially the 2026 tournament could be held in @entity13 given it will be 32 years since the @entity9 was last held there			0
yet the question remains why would n't @entity11 want to benefit from a bidding war between @entity14 , @entity47 and @entity48 and why sell the rights so early ? " @entity11 aims to distribute the highest quality coverage of its international tournaments to as wide an audience as possible , " said @entity11 in a statement to @entity2			1
" @entity11 constantly reviews and monitors global market conditions for sports media rights in order to make the best decision for each market			0
" the agreement extensions announced on thursday were the result of a detailed assessment of the market and discussions with the relevant broadcasters			0
" @entity48 , which retained spanish - language rights through @entity17 , refused to comment on whether it had been invited to bid for the @entity16 version '' we were offered the opportunity to extend our spanish - language rights for another cycle ... and we were happy to be able to complete the transaction , '' @entity115 said in a statement			0
the 2014 world cup final between @entity123 and @entity124 was watched by an estimated 26.5 million in the @entity30 which was up 7 % on the 2010 figures			0
" these events are some of the world 's most important sports competitions , and it is our privilege to be entrusted with these rights in the @entity30 , " @entity14 said in a statement .			1
