-- november 12 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity12 , @entity13 : fridays are awesome ! and we 're not the only ones who think so			2
you 're gon na meet some other people who totally agree in just a few minutes			1
@entity0 starts right now ! first up : @entity22 @entity23 : and we begin today at the @entity22 , where there is talk of war ! but not the type of war most of us think of			1
no guns , no missiles			2
this is a currency war , a war over money			1
it has to do with something that both @entity36 and the @entity37 are accused of : currency manipulation			1
this is when a country changes the value of its currency on purpose			1
usually , it means making your currency weaker			1
why would someone want to do that ? well , if your currency 's less valuable , then your exports , the products that you make and sell to other countries , are cheaper			1
cheaper products usually means more sales , which means more money for the country			1
thing is , if one country is selling more products , that means other countries are selling fewer products			1
@entity62 looks at how a couple cases of currency manipulation are causing tension in the global economy right now			1
( begin video ) @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 : currencies , the new economic battleground			2
according to some analysts , it has now gone to a whole new level			2
@entity75 , @entity76 : this is not officially declared , but i do believe that the world is in a currency war			1
@entity81 : on one side , the @entity36 renminbi			2
on the other , the @entity37 dollar			1
@entity85 : in the past , it 's been one way , @entity37 pushing @entity36			1
and now , we 're going to see two - way arguments			2
@entity81 : and in any battle , words are weapons			2
the @entity37 has accused @entity36 of manipulating its currency , keeping it low to boost exports and take @entity37 jobs			1
the @entity37 has embarked on another round of so - called " quantitative easing , " pumping an extra $ 600 billion into banks to stimulate lending			1
it lowers the value of the dollar			2
@entity36 looks at @entity37 's sluggish growth , financial woes and high unemployment and says , " do n't blame us			1
" @entity106 , vice minister of foreign affairs : if they get cold , they can not ask @entity36 to take the medicine , because this will not cure their cold			2
@entity81 : in the middle , countries like @entity114 : staunch @entity37 ally , but building its economy on the back of @entity36 growth			1
@entity114 foreign minister @entity120 , recently in @entity36 , ever the diplomat			2
@entity120 , australian foreign minister : well , i think , as they say in the classics , it takes two to tango			2
so , these questions are not as simple as that			2
@entity81 : at stake is the very future of the world economy			1
western countries are no longer the engines of growth			2
that belongs to emerging economies			2
according to the @entity137 , @entity36 grew 10 times faster than the global average last year and contributed almost 50 percent of world domestic demand			1
@entity140 : where would we be if @entity36 had not generated phenomenal economic growth in the last 18 months ? i tell you where we 'd be : in a lot of trouble			2
@entity81 : with the world 's number one and two economies facing off , there are fears of a rise of protectionism , putting national interests above the world 's			1
the answer ultimately is cooperation , not conflict			0
( @entity160 ) @entity162 - honoring @entity37 's veterans @entity23 : @entity0 's @entity163 offers ways for you to make a difference			1
today , it 's focused on @entity37 's veterans			1
writing a letter , volunteering your time , just saying thank you : there are many ways to pay tribute to these men and women			1
@entity177 @entity23 : all across the country and around the world , @entity37 took time to honor their nation 's veterans on thursday			1
ceremonies , parades and concerts scheduled all over the @entity185 honored the more than 23 million veterans who are alive today , as well as those who have fallen			1
vice president @entity188 was part of a wreath - laying ceremony at the @entity191 in @entity192			0
he called veterans the " heart and soul , the very spine of this nation			1
" @entity198 @entity23 : this waterfall is part of a different memorial , one that honors some of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks			0
you 'll find it in @entity5 , and it 's part of the @entity208			1
engineers started testing it this week			0
they 've been working on it for years , and the president of the memorial said " to see the water coming down ... was inspiring			0
" the memorial and museum are scheduled to open on september 11th , 2011			0
that is the 10th anniversary of the attacks			0
@entity220 @entity23 : @entity221 says his recent vacation was really fun			0
the worst part ? " being stranded in the middle of the ocean			0
" yeah , that would put a damper on things			0
@entity221 was one of 3,300 passengers who got stuck onboard this cruise ship for three days			0
a fire in the engine room knocked out the power , so no lights , no air conditioning , no hot showers			0
plus , the toilets overflowed and some of the food went bad			0
thankfully , a @entity240 aircraft carrier showed up to help out			0
it brought out some supplies , some extra food			0
the cruise ship was eventually towed back into port , and all the passengers are safely back on land			0
@entity248 @entity249 , @entity13 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity251 's and ms. @entity253 's classes at @entity254 in @entity255 , @entity256 ! in roman mythology , who was the god of fire ? is it : a ) @entity262 , b ) @entity261 , c ) @entity263 or @entity264 ) @entity265 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the @entity268 god of fire was @entity262 ; he was also the god of metalworking			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! erupting @entity274 @entity23 : @entity262 : that 's where the word volcano comes from			1
these things form when molten rock and gases escape from under the @entity282 's surface			1
this year , we 've talked about the effects of a volcano in @entity286 , and more recently about @entity287 in @entity288			0
@entity289 tells us about some volcanoes you might not have heard about and why some people actually choose to live near them			1
( begin video ) @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 : anywhere from 50 to 70 volcanoes erupt every year			1
typically , we only hear about them when they impact human lives			0
in @entity286 , a volcano erupted earlier this year with a large enough ash cloud to cause air travel delays throughout @entity306			0
some scientists say the eruption has ended , since ash was last seen rising from the caldera in june			0
in some areas of the world , locals are used to volcanic activity			2
@entity315 in @entity316 has had a plume of gas that rises from a small , steaming crater lake since its eruption in september of this year			0
in october , a local mining company reported that the plume had changed from gray , which contains ash , to white , which is mostly steam			0
as of october 27th , the plume reduced in size and the local alert level was lowered			0
many people around the world choose to live near these volcanoes because they simply can not afford to move away , while many stay for the mineral - rich soil that yields better crops			1
others profit from the tourism it provides			0
tourism dominates the economy surrounding one of the world 's most active volcanoes : @entity341 , one of the five volcanoes on the island of @entity345			1
earlier this year , lava flows threatened homes on the big island			0
there are currently 14 active volcanoes that outline the @entity351			2
three are in @entity353 , three in northeast @entity354 , and one in @entity356			0
and throughout the @entity351 , many islands have formed over the years because of volcanic eruptions			0
@entity288 currently has three active volcanoes , with @entity287 located in one of the world 's most densely populated areas			1
not only is @entity287 spewing gas and ash and halting air traffic , at times it is releasing pyroclastic flows , gases that are so hot they kill anything in their path			0
( @entity160 ) blog report @entity23 : the question : was this play we showed you earlier this week smart thinking or a cheap shot ? the answers : 90 percent of you favor smart thinking ; 10 percent say cheap shot			0
from @entity386 : " i 'm in football myself ; this was just smart thinking			0
ever heard the saying ' desperate times call for desperate measures ? ' " from @entity389 : " i 've seen many plays like this where the qb gets lit up because the other team 's linebacker saw the trick on @entity396 the night before			2
" @entity399 said " most plays and fakes are just part of the game , but this had nothing to do with skills or how well you could throw a ball , but just how sneaky you could be			0
" before we go @entity23 : always appreciate your blog comments at @entity176			0
we also appreciate the ireports that you send in			0
we 've been showing those at the beginning of our program , but the one we have today had a little something extra			0
@entity417 , @entity418 social studies teacher : every semester , my students here at @entity421 in @entity422 , @entity424 dream of being on @entity0			1
and @entity21 , let me tell you why they should be			0
option a : that 's where we watch student news every single day			2
option b : the @entity434			0
you 're looking at past champions			0
each semester we compete for the @entity438			0
@entity439 : we 're not the only ones pumped for @entity0			1
@entity441 : @entity21 is awesome ! unidentified male student : just like fridays ! goodbye @entity23 : ... just like you guys			0
that was fantastic ! although i hope the pressure to win that @entity248 belt does n't make anyone buckle			0
