@entity0 -- a @entity2 ruled tuesday that occupy protesters will be allowed to return to @entity4 , but they ca n't bring their tents and generators -- once a mainstay of the movement			1
the @entity10 property has been a home for the loosely defined group for nearly two months , spawning similar demonstrations in cities nationwide and around the world			1
police in riot gear cleared them out early tuesday morning , a move that attorneys for the demonstrators say was unlawful			1
but justice @entity22 ruled in favor of city officials and @entity25 , the park 's owner and developer , who have each raised health and sanitation concerns			1
the order does not prevent @entity4 park demonstrations , but says protesters ' first amendment rights not do include remaining there " along with their tents , structures , generators , and other installations to the exclusion of the owner 's reasonable rights and duties to maintain " the area			1
@entity22 said protesters ' rights can not come at the exclusion of those " who might wish to use the space safely			2
" it 's hard to expect much else , " said protester @entity54			0
" the rules are slanted in favor of money			0
" @entity0 mayor @entity59 , meanwhile , said the " court 's ruling vindicates our position that first amendment rights do not include the right to endanger the public or infringe on the rights of others by taking over a public space with tents and tarps			0
" earlier tuesday , at least two people were seen jumping over a metal barricade before they were forcibly removed by authorities			0
video of the park showed security officers picking up one protester and tossing the individual over the fence			1
" the mayor , the police have been itching to do this for weeks , " said @entity81 , a spokesman for the loosely defined group			2
" we 're here to raise an outcry about economic conditions and not get into confrontations with police			2
" hundreds of police and private security guards filled the park and the surrounding area tuesday , as demonstrators circled their former home base			1
" we have an obligation to enforce the laws today , to make sure that everybody has access to the park so everybody can protest			2
" we also have a similar , just as important obligation to protect the health and safety of the people in the park			2
" the operation to clear the park began around 1 a.m. , the mayor said , with police handing out notices from the park 's owner that said the continued occupation posed a health and fire hazard			1
" you are required to immediately remove all property , including tents , sleeping bags and tarps , from @entity4 , " the note said			1
" that means you must remove the property now			0
" police in riot gear then moved into the park , evicting hundreds of protesters			1
dozens of protesters who had camped out at the @entity10 park since september 17 linked arms in defiance			1
many chanted , " whose park ? our park " and " you do n't have to do this			2
" police arrested more than 100 people , according to deputy police commissioner @entity142			0
@entity145 member @entity144 was among those arrested , after he rushed down to the park when he heard police were evicting protesters , his spokesman , @entity143 , told @entity1			1
medical crews treated three people for minor injuries , @entity59 said			0
a police officer was also hospitalized after experiencing heart palpitations , he said			0
continuing concerns about public health and safety and the impact of the protests on nearby businesses , as well as the rights of others to use the park , prompted city officials to dismantle the camp , @entity59 said			1
while the city has a long history of embracing free expression , circumstances at the park had become " intolerable , " he explained			1
the @entity173 website video - streamed the eviction under a banner headline that read , " @entity175 is raiding @entity4			1
" @entity4 is the former name of the park			1
while many protesters left without resisting , many others moved to the center of the park to an area known as the " kitchen			1
" there , they built barricades with tables to keep police away			0
the air was thick with smoke , which some protesters said was from tear gas that officers lobbed			0
others said officers took thousands of books from the camp 's makeshift library and tossed them in @entity198			0
" in an immense show of force , police have shown their presence , " said @entity199 , a spokeswoman for the @entity173 movement			0
" i 've seen how agitated the police are and some ( are ) pushing and shoving to remove us			0
" @entity1 could not confirm those accounts , as police kept journalists a block and a half away from the park during the raid			1
however , @entity1 was able to obtain footage of piles of clothing , tents and tarps made by police as they cleaned out the park			1
later tuesday , police said that protesters seeking to claim personal property that was removed from the park can do so starting wednesday , at a specific @entity226 garage			1
by 4:30 a.m. tuesday , the @entity10 park was clear , with about 40 city crews in orange vests scraping up trash and pressure washing sidewalks			1
after briefly reopening around 8 a.m. , the park closed again as city officials learned of a temporary restraining order issued by state supreme court judge @entity235			1
the order -- which was later denied during tuesday 's hearing , had allowed protesters to bring back tents and other equipment			1
police , however , did not immediately let them in , and a large group of demonstrators -- some of them apparently holding the court documents -- marched back to @entity4 and presented the documents to police			1
" we have a court order , " the group chanted , as it wielded signs and circled the @entity10 park			2
" you do n't have authority over a judge , " they yelled at police			0
several hundred protesters then marched from @entity259 , where they had gathered after @entity4 was cleared , to @entity260 , chanting " we are unstoppable , another world is possible " and " this is what democracy looks like			1
" @entity59 said occupy demonstrators " must follow the park rules if they wished to continue to use it to protest			2
" " protesters -- and the general public -- are welcome there to exercise their first amendment rights , and otherwise enjoy the park , but will not be allowed to use tents , sleeping bags or tarps and , going forward , must follow all park rules , " @entity59 said			2
" the law that created @entity4 required that it be open for the public to enjoy for passive recreation 24 hours a day			2
ever since the occupation began , that law has not been complied with , as the park has been taken over by protesters , making it unavailable to anyone else			2
... the park was becoming a place where people came not to protest , but rather to break laws , and in some cases , to harm others , " the mayor said			0
many protesters complied with the order to remove property , he said , but police and the city 's @entity226 " assisted in removing any remaining tents and sleeping bags			1
" while most protesters were peaceful , " an unfortunate minority " were not , @entity59 said , prompting reports of businesses being threatened and complaints regarding noise and unsanitary conditions			0
many of the hundreds who left quickly reassembled two blocks away , chanting , " we are back together			0
" @entity310 , a 32 - year - old @entity311 veteran , called the health concerns that authorities cited a pretext			0
" it was fairly clean , " he said of the park			0
" no urine or fecal matter			0
there were n't things strewn about			0
" since the protests began in september , the encampment at the park had taken on an air of permanency , with tents covering the public plaza from one end to the other			0
protesters said they were there for the long haul			0
last month , @entity59 had ordered protesters to vacate the park so @entity25 workers could clean it , but @entity25 changed its mind after it said it was " inundated " with calls			2
on monday , police in @entity339 , @entity340 , conducted a similar raid when they moved in to the occupy encampment at @entity343 near @entity260 and tore down tents			0
the tuesday morning eviction of @entity4 comes ahead of plans by the protesters to " shut down " @entity173 on thursday -- to mark the two - month anniversary of their movement			1
@entity310 , the @entity311 veteran , said that the movement will continue whether or not the park serves as a base			2
" you 're going to have to deal with us , " he said			0
" we 're not going to show up for an hour and then leave			0
they 're going to have to acknowledge us			0
" @entity1 's @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 and @entity367 contributed to this report .			0
