-- @entity2 giants @entity1 announced plans monday to stay at their " spiritual home " of @entity5 rather than move to a new stadium			1
the north - west of @entity9 club will be working with @entity10 to regenerate the area around the historic ground , which would include new housing developments			1
under the proposals , @entity5 will be extended from its existing 45,000 capacity to a 60,000 all - seater stadium , enabling the club to better compete with other @entity2 sides such as @entity18 and @entity19			1
the team 's @entity21 @entity20 are renowned for re-developing existing old stadiums , most notably the home of their @entity26 baseball team , now named @entity27			1
@entity1 managing director @entity28 said that the decision to stay at @entity5 rather than move forward with previous 10 - year - old proposals for a new ground at @entity32 , had been heavily influenced by the owners and the club 's 120 - year history			1
" i think this is the spiritual home of @entity1 , " he told the club 's official website			2
" we 've had some of the greatest triumphs in our history here , so it makes sense if there 's a right solution that this is the place we should continue to play our football			0
" criminal proceedings launched in 1989 @entity51 crush the mayor of @entity1 , @entity53 , told a press conference monday that the local authority had developed a " good , honest relationship and partnership " with @entity20			2
he announced that the council had secured a $ 40 million grant to regenerate the area around the stadium , with further investment likely to be achieved			0
@entity53 said he had visited @entity63 to see the @entity27 development and meet @entity1 's owners @entity65 and @entity67 , who took control of the club two years ago			1
they replaced the previous @entity21 pair of @entity72 and @entity73 with widespread approval from @entity1 fans			2
@entity28 said the announcement was a " huge step forward " but warned that it was subject to the " right financing solution " and the @entity81 planning process			0
@entity1 dominated @entity9 football in the 1970s and 1980s , winning 11 league titles and seven trophies in @entity86 competition			0
but in recent years they have played second fiddle to arch - rivals @entity18			0
their success in the @entity91 last season was their first trophy since 2006 , but was not enough for manager @entity93 , appointed by @entity94 , to stay in his job			0
@entity96 took over in the summer , but has overseen a difficult start to the season with a squad weakened by injury and departures .			0
