the mass killing near @entity1 , @entity2 , has prompted a proposal to create a " gun violence restraining order " that would temporarily bar a mentally unstable person from buying and possessing firearms after family , partners or friends call police			1
state assemblyman @entity12 , a @entity13 from @entity1 , said wednesday that the legislation is designed to prevent mass killings similar to last weekend 's rampage that left seven people dead , including the suspected killer , in @entity19 , the off - campus student community for the @entity21 at @entity1 and the local community college			1
the proposed law would create a system where family members , friends and intimate partners could call police to intervene with troubled loved ones			1
law enforcement would be able to investigate threats and ask a judge to issue an order prohibiting firearms purchases and possession , according to @entity12 and state assemblywoman @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , who both announced the legislation			2
@entity12 acknowledged that gun rights advocates are certain to challenge the proposal , but he contended the legislation would balance rights because a mentally unstable person would be entitled to a court hearing to overturn the order			2
" if i was in @entity47 , i would be much more daunted about getting this passed , " @entity12 told @entity46			0
" i think here in @entity2 , people have determined that enough is enough			1
we 're sick and tired of people dying in mass killings			1
" it is not intrusive if the judge still has discretion over the matter at the end of the day , " @entity12 said of the proposed law			2
" and we believe that in this case -- i 'm not omniscient , i ca n't tell you for sure that the tragedy would have been avoided -- but what 's unique about this case is that the mother and father knew there was going to be a problem , and at this point , in current law , there 's no way for them to do something about it			0
" @entity12 was apparently referring to how a mental health agency had been concerned about @entity75 , 22 , the suspected killer in the weekend killings			0
the agency consulted one of @entity75 's relatives and then called police to check on his welfare in april			0
police visited @entity75 but took no further action			0
on friday , @entity75 apparently killed himself after allegedly stabbing to death three people in his apartment and fatally shooting two women outside a sorority and a man inside a deli in @entity19			0
the legislators say there is no mechanism to limit firearm access in most cases involving an individual in crisis while that person is in mental health therapy , substance abuse treatment or anger management , the legislators say			0
currently in @entity2 , family members may call police to intervene , but " if no crime has been committed , or the individual does not meet the criteria for an involuntary civil commitment to mental health treatment , there is essentially nothing that can be done to prevent that individual from purchasing firearms or to temporarily remove firearms from their possession during the crisis , " the legislators said in a statement			1
@entity46 legal analyst @entity118 , a former public defender , echoed that current state law does n't provide an intervention process for such scenarios			1
" there 's no mechanism for the police or for the public or for a mental health professional to basically say , ' we need to take a look at this individual , ' just like we might yank somebody 's driver 's license for acting recklessly , " @entity118 said			0
the legislation has a chance of being approved in @entity2 , @entity118 said			2
" @entity2 has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country , " @entity118 said .			1
