@entity0 -- a fifth man has filed a lawsuit alleging sex abuse by @entity5 , the puppeteer who gave @entity6 's @entity5 his voice			1
the allegations that @entity9 , 25 , made against @entity10 , 52 , are similar to those made by four other men who said they were courted and seduced by @entity10 when they were underage teenagers			1
the lawyer defending @entity10 called the other suits " meritless and barred by the statute of limitations , " but he did not immediately respond to @entity1 's request for comment on the newest filing			1
" mr. @entity5 continues to deny any wrongdoing , and we intend to defend this case forcefully , " attorney @entity20 said when the fourth suit was filed			2
clash was suspended from @entity6 and eventually resigned after the first allegations surfaced in november			1

@entity33 quits after underage sex lawsuit filed the suit said @entity10 sent a luxury car service to pick the teen up in @entity38 and drive him to @entity10 's apartment			1
clash " gave @entity9 alcohol and groomed him with attention and affection , " it said			0
@entity10 and @entity9 engaged in sexual contact , which was " @entity9 's first sexual experience with an adult male , " the suit said			1

the federal statute of limitations on such civil cases is six years , while their allegations involve relationships that ended more than 10 years ago , @entity90 said in a court filing last month			2
