@entity1 , @entity0 -- two giants in the world of club football clash on saturday in a game so entwined in @entity8 history and culture it even has its own nickname			0
many ingredients combine to create the potent @entity13 brew , a game that pitches @entity15 against @entity16			1
@entity16 give then champions @entity15 a guard of honour before last season 's @entity13			1
rivalry between city - clubs for national dominance is common to most nations , but in @entity8 there is extra spice between the two largest conurbations in that @entity16 is situated in , and representative of , the autonomous region of @entity28			2
the @entity31 community is distinct within @entity8 with its own language , culture and strong sense of identity ; situated on the banks of the @entity38 , the team is seen as an extension to this , hence the club 's motto of " more than a club " and the appearance of the @entity31 national flag on its badge			0
real , on the other hand , hail from the capital @entity49 , home to the offices of government , the @entity53 and the larger population			0
indeed , @entity8 's @entity55 gave the club patronage in 1920 and consequently the @entity57 appears on the side 's badge to this day			0
the rifts between the two sides have been exacerbated with wrangles over player transfers down the ages too			0
both clubs laid claim to the signature of the all - time great @entity68 , only for @entity15 to win through and to reap the rewards of his 307 goals for the side			2
@entity16 fans threw a pig 's head onto the pitch in the 2002 @entity78 semifinal to vent their anger at former @entity16 player @entity80 , who moved to real two years earlier			1
more recently @entity15 let the talent of @entity83 's @entity82 leave their ranks , only for the striker to move to @entity16 where he has so far netted over one hundred goals			1
another thorn in the side of @entity16 fans is the edge @entity15 have over their rivals in the silverware stakes : since the first meeting of the clubs in 1902 , @entity15 have accumulated 31 league championships and a record 9 @entity96 against @entity16 's tally of 18 league titles and two @entity96			1
which way do you think @entity13 and the @entity103 title will go ? let us know in the @entity106 box below			1
with this in mind , saturday 's meeting between the two clubs at @entity15 's @entity109 , which can hold over 70 - thousand passionate fans , threatens to be as explosive as ever			1
especially as this season , under the tutelage of @entity31 manager @entity114 , @entity16 have seen their 12 - point lead at the top of the table eaten up by their previously written - off arch - rivals			2
so could the destiny of this year 's @entity103 hinge on the second installment of this season 's @entity13 ? below are the viewpoints of two ardent fans ahead of the game : @entity127 , @entity15 fan : real fan @entity127 shares a @entity130 drink with a fellow fanatic befores last season 's game " i 'm a @entity15 supporter -- we ca n't fear the @entity31			1
i was at the @entity135 last year when @entity15 beat @entity16 4 - 1 and they had to give our players a guard of honor as the champions			1
" we 're out to take the title again as we 've got nothing else to focus on			0
we 'll go out all guns blazing and i think we 'll win because we 're more up for it than they are			0
" i do think @entity16 will still win the league by a point , though			2
but you never know because @entity16 have the @entity148 and the @entity150 final to distract them and a few injuries would change things			2
" some bookmakers paid out on @entity16 winning the title after they beat @entity15 at the @entity155			1
everyone thought it was all over , even me			0
but @entity158 has turned it around by training the players harder and now they 're really fit			0
we 've been winning ugly but we 've kept on winning			0
@entity158 should be given the job permanently if we win the title			0
" prediction : 2 - 1 or 3 - 2 to @entity15 @entity165 , @entity16 fan : @entity16 fan @entity167 with @entity16 forward @entity168			1
" as a @entity16 fan @entity13 is the game that i look forward for the whole season			1
last year was a frustrating and bitter experience			0
frustrating during the first leg in @entity155 where @entity16 dominated the whole game but failed to score an equalizer			2
bitter because during the second leg at the @entity135 , we were humiliated by the score and the @entity16 players gave a " guard of honor " for @entity15 players for the title won before the game			1
" as a @entity16 fan , this was the worst of scenarios and the culmination of years of humiliation			2
@entity15 will have to attack if they want to win this game and stay in the race for the title			0
but i 'm confident that @entity16 will bring a good result from @entity15			1
also i 'm sure the @entity16 players are keen to avenge last year 's humiliation			2
it will decide the title because if we win it will give us a 7 point - lead and confidence to go forward and for @entity15 it will take the wind out of their sails			0
" prediction 1 - 1			0
