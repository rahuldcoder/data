-- from @entity2 to @entity3 to the " @entity4 " @entity5 , there 's a long and distinguished line of famous women in mystery fiction			1
i have a new favorite female sleuth to add to the list , @entity10			1
the self - described " world 's greatest private eye " returns in her second adventure from author @entity13 in " @entity10 and the @entity14 " hitting bookstores this week			1
@entity10 is not your typical @entity18 , and the book is not your run of the mill mystery			1
@entity10 is a new age heroine who uses dreams , visions and intuition to uncover clues and close cases			1
@entity13 's writing is a mix of the gritty noir tradition in crime writing supplemented with a mystical , dream - like quality -- a sort of hard - boiled surrealism			1
in the new novel , @entity10 has moved on from @entity36 , the scene of her last case in " @entity10 and the @entity39			1
" she 's now living in @entity40 when called on to investigate the death of a close friend , her musician ex-boyfriend @entity42			2
police are calling his death a robbery gone wrong , but @entity10 suspects murder			2
the case hits @entity10 hard , bringing up unresolved feelings of love			2
was @entity42 the one who got away ? @entity13 says @entity10 looks at losing @entity42 " as a huge mistake that she 's made in her life of letting someone go , or maybe it was n't a mistake , maybe things were better the way they turned out			1
you just ca n't know and that 's part of what 's really hard for @entity10 , is never really knowing			1
" as @entity10 digs deeper into @entity42 's murder , she 's drawn to one of her past cases , another friend , this time a teenage girl , gone missing in 1980s @entity68			1
the two cases , past and present , lead @entity10 into a downward spiral of self - destructive behavior involving drugs and alcohol			2
@entity13 says writing about @entity10 's personal challenges and seeing her change is what she loves most about the series			1
" people really do change with the character every book			2
i think that 's a bit of surprise to readers because in most detective series the character is the same in every book			2
i wish we were like that in real life			0
things would probably be better			0
" @entity10 is rooted in much of the author 's own experience			1
" there 's a lot that 's autobiographical in @entity96 , " @entity13 says			1
" our life stories are really similar			0
the places where we 've lived and our interests , but we 're more similar in the small things			0
" sadly , @entity13 says those similarities do n't extend to her dreams			2
" i wish i had dreams that were so exciting and deep like @entity10			2
i very rarely have dreams that interesting and noteworthy			0
" readers will get a kick out of @entity10 's method of crime - solving , a mix of mystical and new age philosophy , @entity112 and @entity113 beliefs			1
it 's also rooted in the writings of a fictional @entity117 detective , @entity116 , whose instruction tends to the cryptic			0
a typical piece of advice from @entity116 reads , " a clue is a word in another language and mysteries speak the language of dreams			0
" makes perfect sense , no ? some readers , me included , will latch onto the @entity130 like tangents of " @entity10			2
" others are just in it for the mystery , and @entity13 is fine with that , too			1
" a lot of people just gloss over all the spiritual and philosophical stuff in the books , and they just read them as mysteries , which is ok , " she said			0
" i 'm fine with people reading the book like that , but it is nice to hear from readers who appreciate that aspect of it			0
" @entity13 says she 's borrowed from several different schools of psychology and religion , things she finds personally interesting , to come up with @entity10 's world view			1
she calls it a reflection of her own upbringing , which she says was n't limited to just one faith			0
" i was not raised as a member of any particular religion			0
my parents were always saying decide for yourself , think for yourself , think about what you believe in			0
so all those things are sort of equal to me , " she said			0
" i always feel like whenever you learn something great it 's ok to borrow that			0
i know some people do n't agree and feel like you should stick with one philosophy or one religion , but that 's never really been an option for me			2
" on the other hand , @entity13 says @entity10 is very single - minded in her goal as a detective , uncovering the truth			1
" from @entity10 's point of view solving a mystery and solving a crime are two different things			1
solving a crime is what police and other detectives do , and they can do that better than her			0
she 's not interested in that			0
what she does is solve mysteries , which is restoring truth to a situation			0
" @entity13 is already working on @entity10 's next mystery , and she has a fourth book in mind			1
a @entity194 native now living in @entity195 , she also writes for film and tv , including a past gig on the @entity200 drama " @entity201			0
" @entity13 says she enjoys both			2
" writing books is a very solitary activity while working for tv is very collaborative			0
if i only did tv , i would go crazy although i did only write books for so long it 's been really nice for me to take a break and work with a group of people and not have everything be on my shoulders in terms of telling the story			0
" @entity13 also says there 's a " @entity10 " tv series in the works			1
she 's working on a pilot script with producer @entity218 , one of the creative forces behind past hits " er " and " @entity222			0
" for all the mysticism , the philosophical jags , the hard - boiled behavior , the series is easy to read and fun			0
neither @entity13 nor @entity10 takes themselves too seriously , just take a look at the names of some of @entity10 's past cases , including , ' the case of the @entity234 " or " the case of the @entity236			1
" asked to boil down @entity10 's code as " the world 's greatest @entity18 " into one sentence , @entity13 says , " trust yourself			1
that 's it in a nutshell			0
" read an excerpt from " @entity10 and the @entity14 "			2

the character @entity10 joins a distinguished line of women in mystery fiction
@entity251 solves murders with a mixture of investigative chops and new age philosophy
author @entity13 draws many *parallels* between her own life experiences and @entity259 's
