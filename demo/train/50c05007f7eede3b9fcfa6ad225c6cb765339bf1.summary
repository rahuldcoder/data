-- instead of criticizing president @entity3 's lack of an effective national security policy as the terrorist threat of @entity6 grows in @entity7 and @entity8 , it might be helpful to imagine the speech president @entity10 would have given in response to the videotaped beheading of @entity13			1
there are many things a great power can do if it has leadership			2
this fictional speech is an effort to describe a @entity10 - like grand strategy , clarity of moral purpose and emphasis on effective actions			1
this is not a speech president @entity10 could have delivered in the 1980s			1
we set his speech at @entity30 , near the @entity31 where he would be vacationing			2
this was also the site of his address to the nation after the @entity36 shot down @entity37 in 1983 with a @entity39 congressman aboard			1
president @entity10 entered office when the @entity36 was the great threat			1
he saw @entity42 as the center of evil in the world			2
he was determined to defeat and not merely contain the @entity36			1
through moral persuasion , a powerful military buildup , a grand anti-communist coalition , and an intense focus on a series of economic , diplomatic and psychological strategies , @entity10 defeated the @entity36 empire and it disappeared			1
this was one of the most extraordinary grand strategic achievements in history			1
it took enormous discipline and focus			2
in that era , terrorism was always a secondary or even tertiary issue			2
president @entity10 sought to contain and minimize terrorism with minimum diversion of attention , energy and resources from the great campaign to defeat the @entity36 empire			1
so , this speech is designed to illustrate an alternate @entity39 approach and strategy toward this threat if @entity10 were president in today 's very different world			1
--- --- text of @entity10 address my fellow @entity39 : we have all been saddened and outraged by the vicious videotape of @entity6 terrorists beheading an @entity39 journalist			1
our hearts go out to @entity13 's family			2
however , anger and sympathy are not solutions			2
we , the @entity39 people , must come together in a righteous determination to defend freedom and civilization from barbarism , savagery and terrorism			2
we must calmly , methodically and with the same grim determination we brought to winning @entity94 , implement strategies that eliminate the growing worldwide threat of radical islamists prepared to kill us as individuals and our values as a civilization			1
some will suggest this exaggerates the threat from the @entity103			1
let me remind them of some hard facts			2
there are now an estimated 12,000 terrorists from over 50 countries in the @entity6 - controlled parts of @entity8 and @entity7			1
@entity111 estimates more than 500 @entity113 citizens have joined @entity6			1
our government estimates roughly 100 @entity39 are now engaged in enemy activities			0
when we remember the death and destruction 19 terrorists achieved on 9/11 , we have to take very seriously the threat from more than 12,000 terrorists			1
the chairman of the @entity122 , gen. @entity123 , has warned that @entity6 " has an apocalyptic end of days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated			1
" he has expanded on the danger , saying their vision of a fundamentalist caliphate could " fundamentally alter the face of the @entity128 and create a security environment that would certainly threaten us in many ways			0
" furthermore , gen. @entity123 has warned that @entity6 can not be defeated only in @entity8			1
he asserted , " can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in @entity7 ? the answer is no. " in fact the very existence of terrorists from over 50 countries means that we must be thinking in terms of a global campaign to eradicate the virus of @entity147 and the spirit of terrorism and barbarism that it is fostering			0
this is fully as grave a threat to our survival as was @entity155 or communism			1
with appropriate strategies and consistent policies executed energetically we can defeat and eliminate the @entity103 and its various allied factions			2
@entity6 and its worldwide terrorist allies have become the focus of evil in the modern world			1
secretary of defense @entity164 warned that we must take the @entity103 seriously when he said , " they are tremendously well funded			0
this is beyond anything we have seen			0
... they marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess			0
" they must be defeated			0
yet defeating terrorists and blackmailers is nothing new in @entity39 history			0
in the very first years of the new @entity180 , then - secretary of state @entity178 sent @entity181 , @entity39 consul to @entity182 , on may 13 , 1791 , a letter of instructions for a new treaty with @entity182 that noted it is " lastly our determination to prefer war in all cases to tribute under any form , and to any people whatever			2
" @entity178 hated war and loved peace			0
he also understood that there were times when vicious opponents give peace - loving people no choice but to engage in just war			2
as president , he sent the @entity201 and the @entity202 in 1801 to the shores of @entity204 to reject blackmail , defeat piracy and establish that even a young @entity39 could project power in defense of principle and its citizens			2
we were saddened but not surprised by the vicious , barbaric video of the killing of @entity13			0
back in january we noted that @entity6 leader , @entity214 , gave a speech in which he warned @entity39 , " soon we 'll be in direct confrontation , so watch out for us , for we are with you , watching			1
" they have promised to raise their black flag over the @entity220			0
because i take very seriously the security of the @entity39 and believe that my highest obligation as president is to protect @entity39 , i responded to this direct challenge with a series of quiet steps			0
we moved intelligence assets and began monitoring potential @entity6 targets throughout @entity8 and @entity7			1
we began re-establishing ties with both the @entity232 tribes in @entity8 and the @entity234 allies with whom @entity39 has worked for decades			0
we created an @entity237 intelligence network working with @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240			0
we informed the weak , chaotic government in @entity242 that defeating @entity6 is our highest priority and we will arm , train and coordinate with them and with any effective group prepared to help defeat @entity6			1
we moved strategic assets including @entity248 and @entity250 bombers into position to be prepared to respond decisively to any @entity6 outrage			1
in response to the deliberately vicious and barbaric killing of @entity13 , we began hitting @entity6 targets in both @entity7 and @entity8			1
in the last hour over 200 targets have been hit			0
the air campaign in coordination with @entity234 , @entity232 @entity260 and @entity261 ground forces will continue until @entity6 disintegrates and is incapable of holding territory			1
the 12,000 terrorists from over 50 countries should understand that they can surrender or we will hunt them down			0
terrorists who videotape beheadings operate outside the rule of law and in the tradition of eliminating piracy they will be dealt with as outlaws			0
we will coordinate with @entity111 , @entity238 , @entity239 and every willing partner to develop a strategy and a set of operating principles for the destruction of extremist terrorism			2
when @entity279 returns , i will work directly with its leaders in a bipartisan effort to establish rules for protecting @entity39 and defeating this growing cancer of barbarism			0
with the bipartisan help of @entity279 and our allies , we will pursue our campaign to destroy @entity6 with the four principles i outlined immediately after @entity289			1
we will have a clear plan to win			0
we will develop overwhelming forces among the combined civilized world			0
we will report to you regularly and work every day to keep the support of the @entity39 people for the campaign to destroy terrorism			0
we will define clearly who the enemy is and they will have no sanctuaries			0
in confronting an evil that seeks to kill us and destroy our civilization , our goal must be complete and decisive victory			0
the @entity13 family needs your prayers in this difficult time			0
@entity39 and the forces of freedom need your prayers in this daunting campaign			0
together , civilization will prevail and barbarism will return to the dustbin of history			0
thank you and good night			0
join us on @entity317 / @entity316 .			0
