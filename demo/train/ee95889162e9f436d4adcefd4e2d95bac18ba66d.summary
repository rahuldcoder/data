-- i 've spent the bulk of my career climbing the so - called corporate ladder			0
as chairman and ceo of @entity7 , chairman of @entity9 , and later as @entity10 to @entity11 , i 've been witness to how power is exercised and how people are chosen for leadership roles in the halls of both corporations and governments			0
there are now many more talented women to choose from , and yet we women still hold relatively few positions of influence			1
even though i was a pioneering woman among a world of men , i think it 's harder for women today than it was for me to enter these circles of authority and influence			1
the men at the top do n't know how to appraise women 's potential			1
they do know leadership positions call for a competitive spirit , a fierce resolve and an endless ability to motivate others			0
these qualities , you 'll notice , are not about the work itself ; they reflect a person 's intrinsic way of approaching the work			1
the decision makers know how to size up other men on such characteristics but they do n't know the inner strengths of women well enough to judge , so they choose the known , the familiar - in other words , another man - to fill the top spots			1
this is due partly to the politically correct practices , which have done a lot of good , but have also inadvertently created a sense of distance			0
it has created a scenario where male leaders do n't know or recognize these more intangible skills in the women who are moving up , since these relationships can be quite formal - well , more politically correct			1
it is also because women today , so very articulate , poised , and educated , are not trained to enter the fray			1
@entity69 can turn personal , raw , aggressive , and unfair , with little promise of applause or proof of performance for the tasks ahead			0
but handling all of this is synonymous with leadership			0
these are the terms of engagement , of relationships that go beyond great work skills and flawless logic			1
great work skills , by the way , are something at which women excel , but they are too often tempted to hide behind their great work , rather than step out and be counted when situations turn messy and difficult and leadership is needed			1
women , of course , do have such potent leadership qualities but they 're not sure how to communicate their unique way of being tough and resilient			2
there is a resistance , almost an air of punishment when women overtly move to persuade or seek to influence or press firmly for unpopular decisions			1
it is harder for us to show our leadership qualities over our far more approved of " womanly ways , " such as being modest and communal			2
women have to learn to be leaders on their own terms			1
do n't misunderstand - i am not talking about expecting companies to become kinder and gentler , or preparing special cushions for women to reign from			1
we do n't need exceptions made for us			2
our way is no less fierce or brave or urgent but we do have to learn to unleash all these passions from the true center of who we are			2
women must figure out their own unique qualities and let them loose			2
this is , in my opinion , the most crucial skill missing in working women today			2
only when a woman begins to understand who she is from the inside out can she see where her mastery lies			0
it is a matter of letting everyone know what you believe in and all that you can offer			0
though we are acknowledged to be the more verbal sex , we still need to acquire communications skills that include the ability to confront hostile actions , to motivate the disenfranchised , to reveal intensity of purpose and even to express anger			0
i teach women such things in workshops i call " @entity142 " -- the " x " being women 's potential			1
we always finish with presentations because life at work is really just one presentation after another			0
these can come in the form of emails , phone calls , meetings and even speaking from the podium , but they are all opportunities to present yourself			0
we have found it is very easy for the presenter to disappear behind the charts or within the team			0
after our sessions , the mantra of the women becomes " step out in front of the work			2
" after watching groups of these talented women refine their presentations in every forum , it is incredibly rewarding to see women who had once deferred to their power points , step out in front , exposed and vulnerable but willing to say " i believe			2
" this is how a leader presents			0
when a woman dares to communicate all her unique qualities of leadership to those in charge , she will be tapped to take the lead			0
i am using the next chapter in my life to help women access this untapped power and to achieve their highest potential			1
i feel compelled to do it because this kind of handbook is n't one that i 've found on the bookshelves or in training courses			0
and it 's a book that i wish i 'd had when i first donned my business suit and walked into the big , bad world of marketing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			1

advertising high flyer @entity201 says it has become harder for women to enter circles of influence
she says men at the top do n't know how to appraise women 's potential
therefore , women have to learn to be leaders on their own terms
