-- two years after the end of the @entity4 war , the @entity1 confirmed this week that it is providing the fragile country with sophisticated weapons and drones			1
@entity4 needs help fighting against a growing and serious threat -- @entity11			1
for those who do n't avidly follow the complicated machinations of the globe 's top terror group , this could be confusing			1
has n't the line for years from the @entity19 government and its allies been that @entity11 is on the run , that its fiercest fighting ability has been weakened by @entity19 strikes ? that truth is far more complex , of course			0
the terror group 's manpower has increased in recent years , it has gained control of more territory in @entity31 and the @entity32 and is taking a different approach to death , according to top lawmakers privy to high - level intelligence and experts who have observed @entity11 's activities since september 11			1
a stake in @entity40 while @entity11 suffered significant setbacks after @entity51 shot and killed @entity53 in @entity54 in 2011 , and drone strikes have taken out top terrorists along the @entity54 - @entity58 border , the terror group and its close allies have rebounded in @entity40 , the @entity42 region of @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity4 , and parts of east and @entity47 , among other places			1
@entity59 , or @entity59 , headquartered in @entity40 , is particularly concerning			1
@entity0 has learned of recent intercepts of messages among senior @entity11 operatives in @entity40 , but the messages do n't name specific targets			1
one source told @entity0 that the chatter suggested " active plotting			1
" " there are multiple indications that @entity59 is plotting attacks both within @entity40 , against @entity19 and @entity80 structures and overseas , " said @entity68 , an analyst at @entity69 the @entity40 group is already notorious for sending an operative on board a flight into the @entity19 on christmas day in 2009 with explosives in his underwear			1
@entity59 in @entity40 " are still capable of conducting attacks " and particularly adept at " taking down aircraft , " @entity68 said			1
@entity59 : we 're sorry about @entity40 hospital attack the @entity19 has been fighting back , but not every strike has been successful			1
this month a drone failed to kill an @entity11 planner believed to be behind a plot to attack the @entity89 in @entity90			0
instead , the drone hit a wedding party , @entity40 officials said			1
a powder keg in @entity95 @entity59 - linked militants have established a formidable foothold in the complicated civil war in @entity95			1
there are up to 11,000 foreign fighters from 74 nations in the conflict that has raged since april 2011 , according to the december report from the @entity104 for the @entity105 ( @entity106 )			0
the majority have traveled from other @entity109 countries , creating a significant risk of blowback when these fighters return home			0
" the concern is that the @entity11 networks of the future are being created in this jihadist melting pot , " said @entity114 , a @entity0 terrorism analyst who has specialized for years in studying @entity11			0
read more : @entity120 : concerns over @entity11 's resurgence an increasing number of them are from @entity125 -- approaching two thousand , according to the @entity106 , an unprecedented number , according to experts			2
the @entity19 and its allies fear that those fighters will be able to more easily launch attacks in their homelands or against @entity80 targets , said @entity114			0
" @entity95 is now the fuel for the jihadist movement and some of the most experienced operatives from @entity54 and @entity4 have relocated there , " he said			1
" @entity95 has helped @entity11 rebuild its operations in the @entity109 world , which has always been its intention anyway			1
" read more : @entity59 - linked group strengthens hold in northern @entity95 @entity114 saiid it 's especially scary to consider that @entity11 members in @entity95 could receive training in the terror group 's traditionally sophisticated bomb - making and detonating courses			1
consider that the @entity147 utilized what are considered low - grade explosives , he said			0
@entity59 generally sets the bar higher for destruction on par with the @entity154 attacks in the summer of 2005			2
" it 's possible that new recruits could get training like what we saw @entity11 in @entity54 giving -- showing people how to make high - explosive bombs made of chemicals bought at beauty or home goods stores and detonate them			2
" all they would need to do is return to @entity125 , buy what they need to and carry out an attack			0
" flashpoint partners , a @entity19 outfit that tracks jihadist websites , provided the terror analyst with an @entity11 video that emerged on christmas day			2
it features the @entity177 bombing and also the slaying of a @entity154 soldier in may of this year			0
the @entity181 - published video is an updated @entity183 language version of @entity11 's central video " @entity185 " which was first issued in june 2011			2
that video featured senior @entity11 leaders including @entity189 and @entity19 - born @entity11 spokesman @entity190			0
it calls for @entity11 sympathizers to take things into their own hands and launch attacks in the @entity195			0
both attacks are called models for the future			0
an elusive peace in @entity4 @entity95 borders @entity4			1
though the causes of violence in @entity4 are many-fold , @entity11 's presence there , aided by @entity95 's weakened state , is being felt among the fragile nation 's law enforcement and civilian population			1
between january and november 2013 , more than 7,000 @entity4 civilians were killed , including 952 @entity208 , according to the @entity209			2
april 2013 was @entity4 's deadliest month in five years			1
since the overthrow of @entity212 , @entity210 have been politically marginalized and @entity213 , who represent a majority of @entity4 , have emerged with more power			2
that has led to sectarian violence -- constant bombings and various smaller attacks			0
@entity59 is targeting @entity213 in an attempt to plunge the country into another civil war and hopes to carve out a larger zone of territory under their control on either side of the @entity95 - @entity4 border , @entity114 says			1
smaller bursts of violence are the hallmark of @entity11 's new approach to terrorism , according to the chairs of the @entity235 and @entity236 intelligence committees who appeared on @entity0 's " @entity238 " in early december			2
@entity0 's @entity239 asked @entity241 chair @entity240 if he thought @entity19 were safer in 2013 than they were a few years ago			2
he insisted they 're not , and that @entity19 intelligence and security officials are having a tougher time than ever before trying to stop so many smaller - scale plots			0
but does that translate into a threat specifically in the @entity19 ? to @entity240 , it does			0
" all of them have at least some aspiration to commit an act of violence in the @entity19 or against @entity80 targets all around the world , " he said			0
however , @entity0 national security analyst @entity256 said earlier this month that the data on @entity11 - linked or influenced militants indicted in the @entity19 suggests that the threat of terrorism has actually markedly declined over the past couple of years			0
at least for the moment , " these @entity11 groups in @entity95 and @entity4 are completely focused on overthrowing the @entity264 regime ( in @entity95 ) or attacking what they regard as the @entity213 - dominated government of @entity4			1
and , at least so far , these groups have shown no ability to attack in @entity125 , let alone in the @entity19 , " he said in a column published on @entity0			0
@entity272 : are we hyping the terror risk ? the new @entity59 what motivates @entity11 's newest members ? sen. @entity277 told @entity239 she thought there is still a pervasive belief among extremists that a caliphate -- an @entity283 state governed strictly by @entity284 , or @entity283 , law -- is possible and should be fought for			1
" i think there is a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist , jihadist , @entity283 community , " she said			0
" and that is that the west is responsible for everything that goes wrong ... i see more groups , more fundamentalists , more jihadists more determined to kill to get to where they want to get			0
" @entity114 points to the disappointment many young men felt over what they perceive as a failed @entity301 revolution			0
( @entity59 is still mostly comprised of younger men , though women are taking backseat support roles , he added			2
) in 2011 , tens of thousands of protesters staged a revolution in @entity43 that unseated longtime dictator @entity307			2
@entity308 , then a @entity310 leader , was elected president in the country 's first democratic election in 2012			2
he was deposed by the military last summer			0
this week @entity43 's military - backed government declared the @entity310 a terrorist group			1
on thursday , dozens of members of the @entity320 party were arrested and their property seized , authorities said			0
" the great hope of the @entity301 was that it would liberate the political system			0
but instead it resulted in increased repression against @entity283 , " @entity114 said			0
" for a lot of young men going into @entity95 , in some respect , it 's a reaction to that feeling			1
" " they see the @entity43 and @entity95 government as tarred with the same brush			1
they see those governments as blocking the true flourishing of @entity283			0
" @entity0 's @entity337 contributed to this report .			2

@entity59 rebounds in @entity40 , @entity43 's @entity42 region , @entity44 , @entity4 , east and @entity47
@entity59 in @entity40 is especially concerning
recently intercepted messages suggest " active plotting , " a source says
the terror group has established a strong foothold in @entity95 in the chaos of a civil war
