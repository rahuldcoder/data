-- controversial whistleblower @entity1 was " a very bright boy with a keen sense of right and wrong " when he was growing up , according to his stepfather			1
the young @entity1 grew up constantly on the move , the son of parents who were in the theater business in @entity8			1
@entity9 , who now lives alone in @entity10 , was @entity1 's first real dad , raising him from the age of one and giving him his surname			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity15 , he described his stepson as a " sharp kid who always fought for the underdog			1
" he added : " strangely enough i always thought he would do something like this			2
he was always very independent			2
and he certainly would n't take no for an answer			2
" he always stood up for the underdog			2
i remember that , like with his school friends			2
he was always very angry about people ganging up on other people			2
he had a really good sense of equality and equity			0
" now age 39 , @entity1 faces his toughest challenge yet , as he sits in a @entity35 jail fighting @entity37 attempts to extradite him in relation to a sex crimes investigation			1
cyberattacks follow @entity1 's arrest this comes as his web site , @entity44 , has been releasing reams of classified @entity47 intelligence , prompting politicians and power - players the world over to call for his arrest for exposing sensitive documents			1
supporters contend @entity1 represents free speech at its finest			1
they say he is a man and an organization committed to outing injustices			0
yet despite unrelenting global media attention , @entity1 has remained an enigmatic figure			1
perhaps that 's because he learned as a child to cope with living a solitary life			2
@entity1 has been described by his mother , @entity62 , as " highly intelligent			1
" he was just 16 when she bought him a @entity65 computer			1
it was 1987 , and there were no web sites			0
@entity1 attached a modem to his computer and began his journey through the growing world of computer networks			1
" it 's like chess , " he told @entity75 magazine			2
" chess is very austere in that you do n't have many rules , there is no randomness and the problem is very hard			0
" though his mother raised him without any religious influence , she sensed that from a tender age , her son was led by a strong desire to do what he perceived as just			2
" he was a lovely boy , very sensitive , good with animals , quiet and has a wicked sense of humor , " she told the @entity93 , @entity8 , @entity92 newspaper wednesday			0
he would go on to study mathematics and physics at the @entity99			0
in interviews , his scientific precision shines through			0
he speaks in a baritone voice , in measured pace , choosing each word carefully			0
he can be charming yet cagey about his private life and is rarely shaken by discussions of even the most controversial revelations on @entity44			1
he 's the kind of person who , he says , can hack into the most sophisticated computer system			1
but he can forget to show up for an interview			0
or cancel at the last minute			0
when he talks , he displays an astonishing breadth of interests : from computers to literature to his travels in @entity117			0
even when he walked out of a @entity0 interview in october after refusing to answer questions about the sex charges in @entity37 , @entity1 remained cool and collected			1
he projected a stately demeanor helped by his profusion of gray hair -- which grew at an early age -- and an equally steely facial expression			0
after his initial foray into computers , @entity1 delved into computer encryption and grew keen on computer security			1
he once relayed a story about how he set up an encryption puzzle based on the manipulation of prime numbers			0
the @entity75 article , published earlier this year , described how in 1991 , @entity1 hacked into the master terminal of the telecom company @entity137 , after which he developed a growing fear of arrest			1
he had married and fathered a child when he was only 18 but the relationship fell apart and his wife left him with their infant son			0
he was charged with 31 counts of hacking in @entity8 but in the end paid only a small sum in damages , according to the @entity75			0
the young hacker began to focus his attention away from network flaws to what he perceived as wrongdoings of governments			1
in a 2007 blog post on @entity157 , he wrote : " the whole universe or the structure that perceives it is a worthy opponent , but try as i may i can not escape the sound of suffering			0
perhaps as an old man i will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance			0
but not now ; men in their prime , if they have convictions are tasked to act on them			0
" @entity157 is believed to be a blog created by @entity1 and is registered under the name " ja " by the same @entity47 domain company as @entity44			1
its @entity8 postal address is also the same as a submissions address for @entity44			1
among myriad topics addressed in the blog , @entity1 discusses mathematics versus philosophy , the death of author @entity182 , censorship in @entity184 and the corporation as a nation state			1
driven by the conviction of an activist and the curiosity of a journalist , @entity1 founded @entity44 in 2006			1
he slept little and sometimes forgot to eat			0
he hired staff and enlisted the help of volunteers			0
always , he protected his sources , never discussing where information came from			0
" people should understand that @entity44 has proven to be arguably the most trustworthy new source that exists , because we publish primary source material and analysis based on that primary source material , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" other organizations , with some exceptions , simply are not trustworthy			0
" the web site skyrocketed to notoriety in july when it published 90,000 secret documents about the war in @entity208			0
it was considered the largest intelligence leak in @entity47 history			2
@entity44 followed in october with classified documents about the @entity214 war			1
and then this week , it began posting 250,000 cables revealing a trove of secret diplomatic information			0
some praised @entity44 as a beacon of free speech			1
but others , including outraged @entity223 and @entity224 officials , consider it irresponsible and want @entity44 silenced for what they call irreparable damage to global security			1
@entity1 , the elusive public face of @entity44 , catapulted to celebrity status			1
the image of the lean , lanky , leather jacket - clad figure with the pale skin and mop of white hair was splashed on television screens and websites			0
everyone wanted to know how the editor in chief of @entity44 had pulled it off			1
@entity242 has nominated him for its @entity243 , calling him a " new kind of whistle - blower ... for the digital age			0
" but @entity1 's notoriety did not stop there			1
shortly after the @entity208 war releases , he became the subject of a sex crime case in @entity37			0
the @entity252 issued an international arrest warrant for @entity1 two weeks ago on probable cause in that case , saying he is suspected of rape , sexual molestation and illegal use of force in separate incidents in august			1
he could be sentenced to two years in prison if convicted			0
@entity262 issued a high alert for @entity1 on wednesday at the request of @entity37			1
@entity1 has maintained his innocence and called the charges in @entity37 a smear campaign			2
he has also dismissed reports of internal strife within @entity44			2
@entity270 , a longtime volunteer and spokesman for @entity44 who recently quit his job , told @entity0 that @entity1 's personality was distracting from the group 's original mission : to publish small leaks , not just huge , splashy ones like the @entity278			1
" it is my role to be the lightning rod , " @entity1 said			2
" that is a difficult role			0
on the other hand , i get undue credit			0
" @entity1 's mother said wednesday that she feared her son had become " too smart for himself			1
" " i 'm concerned it 's gotten too big and the forces that he 's challenging are too big , " @entity289 told the @entity92 she did not comment on the sex crimes charges in @entity37			2
but she said lately , @entity1 had distanced himself from his family to protect them			2
@entity1 , too , declined to address the charges in the october interview with @entity0 in @entity297			2
" this interview is about something else			0
i will have to walk if you are ... going to contaminate this extremely serious interview with questions about my personal life , " he said			0
then , he pulled off his mic , said sorry , and walked away			0
