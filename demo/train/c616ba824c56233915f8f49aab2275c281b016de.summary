-- one year after the @entity3 conflict began , the numbers are staggering : more than 8,000 killed , tens of thousands detained , and dozens of towns decimated , according to the @entity5			1
but beyond the statistics , the people of @entity3 find their tragic struggle often reduced to 45 - second fragments on @entity10 or static - filled @entity12 phone calls			1
the reason ? the government 's tight constraints on media access			1
of the few journalists brave enough to defy the @entity3 government 's restrictions , at least five paid the ultimate price , including veteran war correspondent @entity21 and award - wining photographer @entity22			1
one year on , @entity3 still boiling the constant danger means the media have been left to rely on official government accounts , as well as a network of opposition activists scattered across @entity3 and a passionate expatriate community			1
the opposition details what 's happening on the ground through amateur videos , messages describing the latest carnage and eyewitness accounts offered over the phone or @entity37			1
yet while news organizations go to great lengths to verify such amateur reporting , it is no substitute for independent eyes and ears on the ground			0
in other conflicts , a handful of media personnel might capture the full - scale horror of violence			2
a reporter and perhaps his crew may record the moment -- for instance , a young man being shot and killed -- and then edit their content and wrap it into a television piece for air or for a newspaper or magazine story			0
journalists missing in @entity3 but when it comes to @entity3 , it seems everyone in the country is on the front lines , witnesses to tragedies large and small			1
on our @entity75 accounts , on our @entity72 pages , and in our e-mail inboxes , we are confronted regularly by depictions of mutilated corpses , wailing mothers and the pain of a people under siege by their own government			2
how will it end ? the result is jarring : a world forced to watch as @entity3 security forces appear to continually broaden their wrath , with international initiative after initiative faltering in their efforts to resolve the crisis			1
the uprising began in march 2011 , when at least 15 children from the southern province of @entity95 were reportedly tortured at the hands of state security			0
their crime was defacing a school 's walls with anti-regime graffiti , at a time soon after the longtime leaders of @entity104 and @entity105 had fallen under the weight of popular revolutions			2
many of the young boys and girls came home traumatized , their nails pulled out by @entity3 security forces			1
one video showed a young boy in a red - striped shirt , his face bruised and full of fear			0
he introduced the world to a regime with seemingly no limits on what they would do , as well as defiant citizens who were willing to confront it			2
perhaps no video captured the plight of @entity95 's children more than a 2 - minute , 22 - second clip showing the mutilated corpse of 13 - year old @entity129			2
after being detained for just a few days by authorities , @entity131 's body was bloated almost beyond recognition			2
for activists , @entity10 a key weapon more horror stories came out as the months passed by : soccer stadiums packed with detainees in @entity139 , hundreds killed in the military assault of @entity148 during the @entity150 holy month of @entity151 , thousands fleeing shelling in the border of town of @entity143 in hopes of reaching refugee camps in @entity146			0
with each incident , videos came showing nameless victims pleading , crying or falling silent			0
president @entity156 's regime , in statements and through official media , has routinely insisted that " armed terrorist groups " are to blame for the bloodshed			1
its forces , they say , are trying to guarantee security even as they act to defend themselves			0
leaked e-mails remove @entity156 's veil yet the opposition and a growing number of international governments and institutions , including the @entity5 , say the government is the aggressor			1
more recently , and more regularly , they report that security forces have moved from targeting individuals to waging indiscriminate and widespread military assaults on opposition areas			0
amidst this broader crackdown , the people of @entity178 -- a neighborhood in the embattled city of @entity178 -- made history			0
they became the first citizens believed to have broadcast their own destruction , live via social media			0
as @entity3 troops pummeled the 5 - square - mile area , a small group of activists pointed a live stream camera over their rooftops			1
yet many of those activist journalists , among others , have gone silent			0
for example , amateur photographers @entity193 and his cousin @entity195 once had relayed a steady stream of reports before they suddenly stopped			0
the reason why became evident when @entity10 videos showed their bullet - ridden bodies			0
many @entity3 opposition members , however , said it 's not death they fear most			1
" those who are dead are in the mercy of @entity206 now			0
but it is those who are alive , who still suffer , that we are worried about , " an activist told me as he described the death in detention of his friend @entity211 , a peace activist who 'd attended demonstrations with a rose in one hand and a @entity3 flag in the other			2
so far , after taking steps like bolstering sanctions and withdrawing ambassadors , other nations have n't managed to end the suffering			0
yet @entity3 continue to point their camera phones at tanks every day in hopes of getting outsiders ' attention , asking , " how many more people have to die before someone helps us ? " early on , a common rallying cry was , " people demand the fall of the regime			1
" today , as the blood continues to flow , that has been replaced on many @entity3 streets with the more ominous chant , " death and not humiliation			2

@entity3 's government blames " armed terrorist groups " for *ongoing* violence
but @entity3 opposition , and other nations , say the regime is the aggressor
activists use videos and *interviews* to describe what 's happening in @entity3
few journalists have gotten inside the country , and some have died
