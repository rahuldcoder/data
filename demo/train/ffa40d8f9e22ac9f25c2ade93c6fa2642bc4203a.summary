@entity0 likes to make resolutions for the @entity3			1
once he decided he must only eat meat that he had killed himself -- an admirable , if quirky , resolution for any vigorous young man with a rifle			0
another time he decided to learn @entity8 -- not a simple task			0
i wonder how that turned out ? now he 's vowed to start a book club , hoping to channel the reading attention of the millions who follow him on @entity16			1
i like his latest idea a lot : anything that gets people reading and talking about books is a good thing			1
if i were mr. @entity0 , i would aim for books that can be read slowly and carefully by busy people in their spare time , choosing ones with the capacity to enlarge their sense of what it means to be human and to live respectfully and generously among others			1
which ones would you pick ? here are 10 books that have meant a good deal to me -- a mix of fiction and nonfiction : 1			1
" @entity40 , " by @entity41			1
this is the primary text of @entity44 literature , high on any serious list of world classics			1
it 's a book about the @entity44 soul , about race and community , and about the urgent need to " light out for the territory			1
" as @entity55 and @entity56 float down the @entity57 on their quest for freedom , they take every reader of this truly great novel with them , forever			0
" @entity64 , " by @entity65			1
written after @entity65 's conversion to his own idiosyncratic version of @entity70 , this short @entity67 novel brings us face to face with mortality			1
each of us , sooner or later , will die			0
in the process of dying , @entity65 's lead character comes to terms with his life and its meaning , which is made all the more vivid as it fades			1
" @entity81 , " by @entity82			1
this slim , intense novel appeared in 1981 , not so long before apartheid had ended in @entity85			0
it imagined a violent finale to that conflict between blacks and whites -- an ending that ( fortunately ) did n't materialize			0
yet this novel remains a strong evocation of cultural and racial differences ; the sort of book that helps to explain racial divides that continues to haunt us			2
" @entity99 , " by @entity100			0
another great @entity44 book , one that makes the vital connection between spirit and nature			2
it 's an autobiographical masterpiece as well ; the story of one man 's quest for meaning in the wilderness			0
it 's a wry , touching , eloquent evocation of human consciousness as well as conscience			0
nobody can afford not to read this book slowly , carefully , more than once			1
" @entity116 , " by @entity117			1
this fine @entity119 novel has been justifiably chosen by millions of readers as a book that gloriously summons the social , cultural and intensely personal situation of modern @entity119 living in the wake of colonial power			2
@entity117 saw his fellow @entity126 as individuals caught in a web of social relations , delineated here with clarity and confidence			1
" @entity133 , " by @entity134 , translated by @entity135			0
this @entity8 classic is one of the most influential books i have encountered in half a century of reading			2
the art of living is beautifully unfolded here in 81 tiny chapters			0
the author invites us to conform to the @entity145 itself , the universal principle of being , and his book teaches us how to live with ourselves and with others , how to govern a nation , a family , ourselves			2
it is a book to live with and learn from , decade after decade			2
" @entity153 , " by @entity154			1
this lovely work of @entity44 autobiography is about paying attention to one 's surroundings			0
@entity154 explores the natural world around her home in the @entity162 , moving through the seasons , coming to terms with her own solitude , her sense of vocation as a writer , and her understanding of what faith means			1
it 's a book that should be read in tandem with @entity100 's " @entity99			1
" what is @entity174 ? " by @entity175			0
a philosopher and religious scholar , @entity175 writes about his own spiritual journey from atheism to a more complex understanding of the source of all being			0
@entity175 asks : " who is wise ? " his answer is : " one who learn from everything and everyone			0
" this book asks , even answers , many of the basic questions about being human , drawing on a wide range of religious traditions			2
" of woman born : motherhood as @entity195 , " by @entity196			0
published in 1976 , this eloquent meditation on motherhood is told from the viewpoint of one of the finest @entity44 poets of the 20th century			0
it 's a landmark study , a foundational book in modern feminist thought , and well worth reading , then rereading			2
" @entity205 , " by @entity206			0
the longest book on my list , but nobody can afford to ignore it			2
my old mentor , the @entity213 poet @entity212 , used to say that anyone who has n't read this book is still an intellectual virgin			1
@entity206 tells the story of a single family in a remote village in @entity220			0
but this story is the human story writ small , the story of history itself , with its inevitable repetitions , its recurring ghosts , grounded in the nearly untranslatable poetry of human feeling .			0

@entity231 : @entity0 starting book club . he should read books that illuminate humanity
he says classics by @entity41 , @entity82 , @entity65 , @entity117 , @entity154 among 10 must - reads
