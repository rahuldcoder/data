former @entity1 running back @entity2 has won his appeal of his indefinite suspension by the @entity5 for violating its domestic violence policy , the players union said friday			1
" the suspension has been vacated , " @entity8 , the assistant executive director of external affairs for the players ' union , said			0
@entity2 issued a written statement thanking his supporters , " most importantly , my wife @entity15			1
" " i made an inexcusable mistake and accept full responsibility for my actions , " @entity2 said , referring to two disturbing videos that show him knocking out his now - wife , @entity17 , on an elevator in a casino in @entity20 on february 15			1
" i am thankful that there was a proper appeals process in place to address this issue			0
" he said he will continue to work hard to improve himself and learn from his mistakes			0
former @entity30 district judge @entity29 , a neutral arbitrator , presided over @entity2 's appeal hearing in @entity32 earlier this month			1
her decision means @entity2 is immediately able to play but any team will have to consider the consequences of signing someone whose domestic - violence case has been so public			1
judge : second suspension was ' arbitrary ' in september , hours after the @entity1 cut @entity2 , @entity5 commissioner @entity40 lengthened @entity2 's suspension from two games to an indefinite period			1
" because @entity2 did not mislead the commissioner and because there were no new facts on which the commissioner could base his increased suspension , i find that the imposition of the indefinite suspension was arbitrary			1
i therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on @entity2 , " @entity51 wrote in her decision			1
she said the case was n't about the number of games that @entity2 was suspended but the need for @entity40 to be " fair and consistent " in its discipline			1
" following the release of the inside - the - elevator video , which prompted a new round of criticism , the league suspended @entity2 indefinitely			1
now , the league argues that commissioner @entity40 was justified in imposing the second discipline because @entity2 had misled him and because the video demonstrated a level of violence that he had not understood			2
" i have found that @entity2 did not mislead the commissioner			2
moreover , any failure on the part of the @entity74 to understand the level of violence was not due to @entity2 's description of the event , but to the inadequacy of words to convey the seriousness of domestic violence			1
that the league did not realize the severity of the conduct without a visual record also speaks to their admitted failure in the past to sanction this type of conduct more severely			0
" league : we respect decision in august , after outrage over @entity2 's initial two - game suspension , @entity40 announced a new league policy for domestic violence and other assaults			1
first - time offenders would be suspended at least six games and a second offense would draw a lifetime ban			0
but he did n't alter @entity2 's punishment at that time			1
provisions of the initial suspension -- which include counseling , not getting in legal trouble again and not getting in trouble with the @entity5 again -- still stand , she wrote			1
the two - game suspension would have ended in september			2
a spokesman for the @entity5 , @entity111 , said the league respects the decision			1
it is questionable that @entity2 will return to the field this season			2
" if a team wanted to sign him and put him on the field that could happen but we 're not expecting that to occur any time soon , " @entity118 's @entity117 said			0
" if you 're a team that needs a running back , are you going to sign @entity2 knowing the backlash against him , knowing how people in the public feel about it ? " still , winning is the most important thing in the @entity5 , she said , and there is a possibility @entity2 could get a new contract if a new team thought he could help it win games			1
the @entity5 said the league is working to implement a new personal conduct policy in the wake of the ruling			2
" judge @entity51 ' ruling underscores the urgency of our work to develop and implement a clear , fair and comprehensive new personal conduct policy , " said @entity141 , the @entity5 vice president of communications			1
" we expect this policy to be completed and announced in the weeks ahead			0
our focus is on consistently enforcing an improved policy going forward			0
" @entity17 speaks @entity150 obtained two videos from the footage taken from surveillance cameras of the altercation with @entity17 in @entity20			0
it posted the first one , which showed @entity2 dragging @entity17 -- limp and face down -- out of the elevator , shortly after the incident			2
the in - elevator video showing the violent punch was put online september 8 , the same day @entity2 was released and suspended			1
in a first - person piece published on @entity163 , @entity17 said her husband understands violence is unacceptable			0
" @entity2 told the truth and has fully accepted responsibility for his actions , which allowed us to work together at improving ourselves and get to the better place we are today , " she said			2
she admitted she has a hard time being called a victim			0
" i know there are so many different opinions out there about me -- that i 'm weak , that i 'm making excuses and covering up abuse -- and that some people question my motives for staying with @entity2 , " she wrote			0
" however , i 'm a strong woman and i come from a strong family			0
" the @entity184 also were interview by @entity186 , portions of which will be aired monday and tuesday			0
@entity17 told the network that she was furious at first but knew that the relationship -- she was his fiancee at the time -- was n't over			0
@entity2 's future not with @entity1 @entity2 , 27 , is currently a free agent			1
he was a three - time @entity193 selection in eight seasons and played on the @entity1 ' @entity196 championship team in 2012 season			0
" we are aware of the ruling			0
our owner has already stated that we will not resign him , " the @entity1 said in a statement			0
in march , a grand jury indicted @entity2 on a charge of third - degree aggravated assault , and a simple assault charge against @entity17 was dropped			1
the couple were married the next day			0
@entity2 pleaded not guilty to aggravated assault and applied to a program for first - time offenders that could clear him of charges in one year			2
@entity212 , the president of the @entity213 , said the @entity5 needs for two things to happen : for @entity40 to resign and for the league to examine thoroughly how it handles domestic violence cases			0
another women 's rights group , ultraviolet , said the case is another failure of the @entity5 to take domestic violence seriously			2
" the problem here is the @entity5 's long history of sweeping abuse under the rug , " co-founder @entity222 said .			2

@entity2 's wife tells @entity186 she was angry but knew she would stay with the player
@entity2 says he made " inexcusable mistake "
judge writes that @entity2 should n't have had suspension increased because he did n't lie to @entity5
@entity5 says it respects decision by third - party arbitrator
