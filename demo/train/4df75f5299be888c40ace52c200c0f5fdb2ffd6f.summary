despite being a six - time @entity16 champion , it was @entity1 's first gold at the @entity13 and he celebrated by prolonged laps of honor of @entity20 , signing autographs and posing for endless selfies			1
it was a fitting finale for the athletics program and @entity1 had treated the capacity crowd to his usual pre-race antics , cavorting to " i 'm gon na be " by the @entity27 before switching to race mode as only he can			0
@entity9 's last leg runner @entity30 might have dreamed of gold but he could not match @entity1 's giant stride and had to settle for a deserved silver ahead of @entity35			2
@entity6 's women 's quartet also won their sprint relay , anchored by the reigning @entity16 and world sprint champion @entity39			1
like @entity1 , she has been having a relatively low - key year ahead of preparing for the @entity42 in @entity43 , but still showed a neat turn of foot to lead her team home in 41.83 seconds , also a @entity13 record			0
@entity49 took silver ahead of @entity9			0
earlier , 40 - year - old mother of two @entity52 struck a blow for veteran athletes with a superb bronze in the women 's 5,000m for @entity9			0

away from the track and field action , @entity9 's @entity74 dominated the men 's 10m platform diving to retain his title in superb style			1
he put together six fine dives to win by over 82 points			0
the 20 - year - old @entity74 was one of the poster boys of the @entity83 , where he took bronze , and his gold was one of the highlights for an @entity9 team who have easily topped the medals table at the @entity13 ahead of arch - rivals @entity91			2
the final day of action will see the men 's and women 's road races in cycling and an eagerly - anticipated @entity99 - @entity91 clash in the women 's netball final			1
