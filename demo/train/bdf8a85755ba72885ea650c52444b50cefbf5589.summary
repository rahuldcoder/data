-- democrats , as president @entity2 said wednesday , took a shellacking in tuesday 's contentious midterm elections			1
they lost control of the @entity7 to @entity8 but managed to cling onto a reduced majority in the @entity10			1
the election will reverberate throughout @entity13 politics , with the newcomers vowing to lower government spending , cut taxes and torpedo the president 's health - care legislation			1
the @entity8 victory generated an outpouring of commentary			1
here are some thoughts from @entity0 's opinion section			0
message to @entity2 : @entity13 want jobs the midterm election was clearly a repudiation			1
the question is , a repudiation of what ? fifty years of data from one election after another has shown that people vote with their gut , and this year the gut of the @entity13 voter -- left , right and center -- was angry and anxious			1
it 's not hard to understand why : one in 10 @entity13 of working age is out of a job and six in 10 are living from paycheck to paycheck			1
in times like these , most people can tell you what they are feeling , but when asked what would make them feel better , they can only guess			0
so in exit polls , some said we need to cut deficits and that would make them feel better			0
others said they 'd like to see the government do something , anything , to create jobs , something an anemic private sector has proved unable to do -- and has not done since the passage nearly a decade ago of the @entity63 tax cuts , which stimulated nothing but inequality			1

why did @entity75 vote down legal pot ? @entity75 voters have just rejected @entity78 , the ballot initiative that would have legalized marijuana under state law			1
where did @entity78 19 go wrong ? @entity78 failed in part because many proponents emphasized the wrong arguments for legalization			1
many advocates promised major benefits to @entity75 's budget because of reduced expenditure on marijuana prohibition and increased revenue from marijuana taxation			1
other supporters claimed @entity95 drug violence would fall substantially			0
the budgetary benefits , while not insignificant , would have been small compared with @entity75 's fiscal mess			1
@entity95 drug violence is mainly associated with the cocaine and methamphetamine trades , as well as from marijuana traffic to other states			0
many voters sensed that @entity78 supporters were overreaching , and this made them suspicious of all the arguments in its favor			2
common sense should have recognized that since marijuana was close to legal already , @entity78 would not have had dramatic effects			1

ten most memorable political ads billions of dollars poured into political ads this election cycle			1
they were n't just negative commercials or attack ads , but messages of searing personal indictment			1
the question is : did they work ? there 's no easy answer , but there 's a nuanced one			0
under the right circumstances -- where these attack missiles connect with a pre-existing ( even a latent ) negative perception -- they can be devastatingly effective			1
repetition makes them work even better			0
this is a phenomenon called the " illusory truth effect " and holds that hearing something multiple times increases its perception of accuracy			0

shades of 1994 and @entity157 - @entity8 gridlock republicans effectively gained control over @entity160 on tuesday			1
the @entity8 won a majority of seats in the @entity7 , thus overturning the gains @entity164 made in 2006 and 2008			2
in the @entity10 , where the procedural power of the minority has already given @entity8 the power to shape deliberations , the narrowed @entity164 ranks will further weaken the majority			2
in the weeks running up to the election , there were some commentators who concluded that the current situation would be the best outcome for president @entity2			0
... yet this analogy rests on a selective memory of what happened after 1994 , which is particularly surprising from someone who worked in the administration			0
the period that followed those midterms was among the most contentious in recent @entity13 politics			2

next time , @entity164 should try wooing the loyal youth vote many will call the 2010 election the rejection of the @entity2 agenda heard round the world			1
but young voter turnout tells a very different story			0
@entity0 's exit polls show 55 percent of voters 25 to 29 voted for @entity164 , compared with 42 percent for @entity8			1
even more striking , 58 percent of voters age 18 to 24 voted for @entity164 compared to 39 percent for @entity8			2
ironically , the group often labeled fickle and impatient have remained solidly committed to the agenda of change they overwhelmingly voted for in 2008			0
in the face of record unemployment and the very circumstances that pundits speculate make the country more resistant to change , young voters sent a very clear message of support for @entity2 's agenda			1

@entity224 activist : @entity8 beware ! tuesday 's elections show @entity13 is indeed a center - right country			1
@entity13 widely rejected the @entity164 ' big - spending policies and sent the @entity164 majority in the @entity7 packing			1
for nearly two years , @entity13 told the @entity164 they did not approve of expanded government programs with large price tags such as bailouts , the stimulus bill , @entity233 , cap and trade and " @entity2 care			2
" time and time again , the @entity164 , misreading their election win as a mandate to increase the size and scope of the federal government dramatically , rammed through unpopular legislation against the will of the majority of the @entity13 people			1
tuesday , they paid the price for their arrogance and miscalculations			0
the @entity8 won by virtue of not being @entity164			2
they did little to earn their victory			0
to many , their pledge to @entity13 is weak tea and does n't go far enough in reducing spending and the size of the federal government			2

how @entity265 spent a fortune -- and lost on a day that millions of @entity13 in other parts of the country turned the electoral map red by electing a sea of @entity8 , @entity75 voters stayed true blue and kept doing what they usually do on @entity273 -- elect @entity164			1
and , in a year where a lot of voters wanted to throw the bums out and get rid of career politicians , @entity75 -- in the headliner contests -- rejected a pair of wealthy and former @entity280 in favor of a couple of longtime politicians and party insiders who , between them , have spent more than a half century ( 58 years ) in political office			1
the rest of the country was experiencing a revolution			0
in @entity75 , it was more like a " retro - lution			2
" @entity292 did not necessarily breed contempt			0
in fact , it helped put a couple of high - profile victories in the @entity164 column			0

quick shots @entity305 : a victory for checks and balances so far , the election is n't quite the far - right stampede it was supposed to be			0
sen. @entity311 in @entity312 and rep. @entity313 in @entity314 were putting on strong showings in their @entity10 races ; independent gubernatorial candidates @entity318 in @entity319 and @entity320 in @entity321 were also hanging tough			0
@entity322 : vice president @entity323 in 2013 tuesday was a great night for @entity8 because as @entity323 said , we now have a second chance			2
it 's still important to remember this country is not quite yet a @entity8 country , but as of tuesday night , it is saying it is most definitely not a @entity164 country either			1
let us celebrate , but then let us get to work , the serious work we promised			0
@entity331 : @entity8 gains not sky - high the expectations game was one the @entity8 built up for themselves , with , in closing days , a number of @entity8 really buying the hype that they could get to a gain of 80 or 90 seats in the @entity7			2
@entity337 : congratulations to @entity8 -- and to @entity339 good manners compels me to congratulate the @entity8 on what looks to be a historic victory			1
and i would be remiss if i did not recognize the historic speakership of @entity339			0
@entity300 : having it both ways here 's an election story that wo n't go away			2
last week , president @entity2 caused a dustup when he went on a @entity350 - language radio show hosted by @entity351 and advised @entity353 voters to reward their friends and punish their enemies			0
@entity356 : big congressional shift is near @entity358 once said of @entity359 that " he hits you so hard it changes the way you taste			0
" anyone politically astute enough to know that tuesday night will not be particularly favorable for the @entity164 will be expecting the coming blows			0
and if pollsters , pundits and prognosticators are right ( and i think they are ) , everything is going to taste different at the @entity371 on wednesday			0
