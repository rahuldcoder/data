" would you tell a joke mocking the @entity2 ? " being a comedian who is @entity6 , i ca n't tell you how many times i 've been asked that question over the years			2
and in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in @entity11 , i am again being asked it over and over			2
my answer before the attack was that i have never told jokes mocking the @entity2 , nor have i told jokes mocking @entity17 , @entity18 or any other religious figures			1
and now after the attack , i 'm certainly not going to go out of my way to write jokes about those subjects			1
i refuse to alter my freedom of expression because of terrorists			1
yet some -- mostly on the right -- have insisted to me , via social media , that i must now do jokes mocking the @entity2			1
they frame it — bizarrely -- as a litmus test for my patriotism to @entity33 or my support for freedom of expression			1
just so it 's clear , as a writer , comedian and @entity40 , i strongly believe that all the cartoons depicting the @entity2 should be published , uncensored by media outlets			2
( in fact , i have organized a comedy benefit in @entity45 for next week in defense of freedom of expression that will features mostly , but not all , @entity6 comedians			1
) but what jokes are acceptable to show should be the choice of every media outlet , just as it 's the choice of every comedian to decide which jokes he or she wants to tell			1
freedom of expression encompasses both the choice to say what you want and to refrain from saying things you do n't want to			1
so why wo n't i tell jokes about religious figures ? it has nothing to do with religious beliefs			1
the reason , simply put , is that my comedy focuses on mocking the people in power ; the ones who are committing the bad acts or holding elected office ( and often those two are the same			2
) the @entity2 died nearly 1,500 years ago			0
he is n't doing anything			0
@entity76 , @entity77 and the like are , so they are the ones i will continue to mock			0
this is the same reasoning that guided me and my co-director , @entity80 , in our choices for the 2012 comedy documentary " the muslims are coming ! " the film , which uses humor to counter misconceptions about @entity84 , also comically mocks the @entity89 bigots			1
but even though some of these haters were self - proclaimed @entity92 leaders , like the rev. @entity93 and the @entity95 's @entity94 , we did n't mock @entity17 for their actions			0
no , we went after the people spewing the hate			0
still i was curious as to how my fellow comedians , especially the @entity6 ones , would respond to the @entity11 attack			1
would it change their comedy in any way ? would it make them more defiant in their content choices ? would any be more hesitant to do certain jokes ? so i asked about 20 comedians , via social media and email , about the @entity11 attack			1
regardless of whether they were @entity84 living in @entity116 or atheists living in @entity45 , the comics ' responses were consistent : they denounced the @entity11 attack and stood up for freedom of expression			1
that was true even for some of the @entity6 comedians , who acknowledged that they could understand why the cartoons of the @entity2 could offend people			1
but none of the @entity6 comedians said they were personally offended			2
( generally , it takes a lot to offend a comedian ! ) @entity131 comedian @entity130 explained by email that there are limits on comedy content in much ( but not all ) of the @entity136 when it comes to jokes about religion , sex and politics			1
some of the restrictions are based on laws , while others are imposed by comedy show producers in the hopes of not offending audience members ( it 's bad for business )			0
of the terrorist attack on @entity151 , @entity130 wrote , " this ' @entity6 ' response needs to stop , it has no place in our religion and is no way justified by the @entity157			0
" @entity158 , one of the best - known @entity6 - @entity33 comedians , has pushed the envelope over the years			2
@entity158 explained via email that she has told jokes that mentioned the @entity2 in the past and would do so in the future			2
" i will not let extremists scare me silent , " she said			0
interestingly , @entity167 's @entity166 did acknowledge that the @entity11 terror attack would change his comedy			0
but not as you might predict			0
@entity166 noted via @entity171 that he 's more motivated now than ever to become better known as a comedian so he can use his fame and comedy to " reclaim @entity84 from these radicals			0
" this sentiment — taking back @entity84 from groups like @entity76 through comedy -- has been gaining for months in the @entity136			0
@entity6 comedians across the region have been risking their lives to ridicule @entity76 in tv shows and @entity184 videos			2
they have , in effect , called out @entity76 for being the " un-islamic " state			0
but as @entity45 based comedian @entity187 ( not a @entity6 ) mentioned , telling jokes about any religious figure , not just @entity2 , can be challenging : " i 've been physically threatened for telling @entity17 jokes			2
... am i a coward if i do n't joke about certain things that could cause a dangerous reaction ? or am i smart ? i honestly do n't know			0
" there 's no right answer to this thoughtful question			0
to me it sums up the essence of free speech			0
it 's a choice that each person should be free to make			0
we must defend both those who are making statements that offend and those who choose not to do so .			1

@entity208 : some challenge him to tell @entity89 jokes in defiance of terrorists
but he and other comedians say freedom means being able to choose to offend or not
