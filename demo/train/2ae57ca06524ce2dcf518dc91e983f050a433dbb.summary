-- it was a big year for women , 2013			1
in the past 12 months , @entity4 coo @entity3 called on her fellow females to " lean in " to their careers			2
and lean in they did : @entity8 was nominated to become the first woman to head the @entity10 and @entity11 named @entity12 the auto industry 's first female ceo			1
in a new epilogue to her book " @entity17 of men : and the @entity27 , " @entity19 wrote that , thanks in part to strong political women like @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , the patriarchy is officially dead			1
but not all landmark moves by women were points scored			1
a few of the year 's biggest missteps serve as powerful reminders of what not to do in 2014 : say things in private that you would n't in public : as part of a lawsuit filed by a former employee , erstwhile beloved celebrity chef @entity38 admitted to having used racial slurs , including the n - word , and admiring a plantation - style event where the " whole entire wait staff was middle - aged black men			1
" it was a particularly ironic revelation , given that she 'd built her reputation on being something of a comforting , maternal figure			2
she was promptly fired by the @entity51 and lost endorsements with , among others , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57			2
tweet without thinking : just before the holiday , pr exec @entity58 pressed send on a last - minute tweet before boarding a 12 - hour flight : " going to @entity62			2
hope i do n't get @entity63			0
i 'm white ! " she had just a few hundred followers at the time			0
but the @entity65 has a way of making the intimate go viral , and by the time @entity58 landed in @entity62 , she was the biggest @entity65 story of the week			0
she endured public excoriation and , ultimately , lost her job			0
and though @entity58 's words were insensitive at best , the outrage that followed -- which included some death threats -- proved that @entity58 is n't exactly the only one lacking empathy			0
tell only half the story : @entity77 's deeply flawed report on @entity78 that aired on " @entity79 " threatened the long - running news program 's credibility and called into question journalistic practices across the board			1
the worst part : the mistake was avoidable , according to a @entity87 review that stated the accounts provided by the report 's key source differed from versions provided to the @entity92			0
as a result , @entity93 and her producer were suspended			0
stay silent in the face of criticism			0
when the website for @entity100 launched -- or , more accurately , failed to launch -- it was @entity103 secretary @entity102 who took most of the heat			1
millions called for her firing , and the voices only grew louder as @entity102 initially refused to testify before @entity110 about the nearly inoperable website			1
@entity114 ' butt - shaking , foam - finger - waving performance at the @entity115 in august was a lesson in how shock sells			1
though the act spawned much outrage -- @entity120 reportedly pulled its plans to feature her on the cover , and longtime boyfriend @entity124 moved on as well -- album sales climbed			0
but then she followed it up with a topless photo shoot with @entity128 ; a not - quite - pornographic music video ; and an admission that , yes , she is singing about drugs ( sorry , kids ! )			0
in the end , the takeaway was clear : the act overshadows the talent			0
chances are good that as we move into 2014 , it 's the foam finger we 'll remember more than @entity114 's songs			1
@entity143 mother of three @entity144 became headline news for a photograph she posted to her @entity4 account in which she appeared toned and tanned in a sports bra and short shorts beneath the provocative caption , " what 's your excuse ? " after the photo went viral -- and @entity155 was bashed for " fat shaming " -- she claimed she 'd only intended to motivate others			0
what ensued brought out bullies on both sides , and served to undermine any positive conversation @entity155 might have envisioned			0
the fact is that by posting the photo , @entity155 was issuing judgment on others			0
and she was judged in return			0
assume all women want the same things			1
even one of the year 's more inspiring messages for women contained elitist notes : in calling for women to " lean in " to their careers , @entity4 coo @entity3 assumed that all women want to " have it all " -- or even want the same things , period			1
her book , " @entity181 : women , work , and the @entity185 to lead , " ignited a powerful discussion			1
but in some ways her experiences are so far from the norm of the majority of women in the workforce , and her edict about what women " should do " is so absolute , that her larger message , unfortunately , got lost at times			2
@entity196 : 10 women who shaped 2013 of course , 2013 was filled with many gains -- @entity201 state sen. @entity200 ' pro-choice filibuster , @entity203 ceo @entity202 standing by her decision to ban working from home , then seeing the company 's stock soar , and @entity209 's very public double mastectomy among them			1
for every errant twerk , pop culture saw its share of positive messages for women , including @entity216 's " @entity217 " -- a @entity220 girl 's tale of being shot by the @entity221 for speaking out about the rights of women -- and the consistent challenging of the @entity225 body ideal in @entity227 's " girls			2
" missteps are part of the normal course of life ; they are n't a step back			0
but it 's key to remember , as we enter 2014 , as women make greater strides in the battle toward complete gender equity , that their words and actions matter			2
greater gains , after all , also mean more people are watching			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			1

@entity245 : 2013 saw big gains for women but some mistakes we can all learn from
she says @entity38 , @entity102 , @entity114 , @entity77 were some who stumbled
@entity245 : @entity8 , @entity12 were among the *trailblazers* in the rise of women this year
