-- the @entity1 is likely to remain the leading world power in 2030 but wo n't hold the kind of sway it did in the past century , according to a new study by the @entity1 intelligence community			1
@entity8 will most likely hold its status as " first among equals " two decades from now , buoyed not only by military strength but by economic and diplomatic power			1
that 's one of the conclusions of " @entity16 , " released monday by the @entity17			1
@entity19 and other rising powers may be " ambivalent and even resentful " of @entity1 leadership , but they 're more interested in holding positions of influence in organizations such as the @entity25 and the @entity26 than assuming that role , the report found			1
" nevertheless , with the rapid rise of other countries , the ' unipolar moment ' is over , and ' @entity33 ' -- the era of @entity1 ascendancy in international politics that began in 1945 -- is fast winding down , " the report states			1
monday 's 166 - page report is the fifth in the " @entity42 " series by the council , an arm of the @entity41			1
it does n't make specific predictions , but says that the world is at a " critical juncture " in which technology is advancing , competition for resources is growing and a middle class is emerging in countries around the world			1
" our effort is to encourage decision makers -- whether in government or outside -- to think and plan for the long term so that negative futures do not occur and positive ones have a better chance of unfolding , " council chairman @entity53 wrote in the report 's preface			2
the report lays out a series of possible futures , both optimistic and pessimistic , from a world in which globalization has stalled and the risk of war has gone up to one in which collaboration between @entity8 and @entity72 produces a rapid increase in worldwide prosperity			1
technological advances will give individuals more freedom , but also have the potential to provide small groups with the kind of destructive capabilities now available only to nations			0
" with more widespread access to lethal and destructive technologies , individuals who are experts in such key areas as cyber systems might sell their services to the highest bidder , " @entity53 said during a briefing on the report			2
" terrorists might focus less on mass casualties and more on causing widespread economic and financial disruptions			1
" economic power is likely to shift away from the @entity1 and @entity98 to @entity19 , @entity99 and @entity101 countries , and @entity102 will see an urban boom as people move to cities at a faster rate , the report concludes			1
but those developments will add pressure to deal with environmental issues such as more frequent or severe droughts and the projected rise in sea levels due to a warming climate			0
" under most scenarios -- except the most dire -- significant strides in reducing extreme poverty will be achieved by 2030 , " the report notes			2
the numbers of people living in poverty is likely to drop sharply in @entity120 and @entity121 , the @entity122 and @entity102 , with @entity123 lagging behind			0
@entity53 said , " economic growth , the rise of the global middle class , greater educational obtainment and better health care mean -- for the first time in human history -- the majority of the world 's population will no longer be impoverished			1
" but perhaps the biggest question mark in the report is the @entity122			2
the region " will be a very different place " in 2030 , the authors conclude			0
" but the possibilities run a wide gamut from fragile growth and development to chronic instability and potential regional conflicts			0
" the youth boom that has driven the @entity147 revolts will give way to an aging population , while shifts in energy consumption may force oil - rich @entity122 economies to find new sources of income			0
the growth of middle classes will increase demand for political and social change , but that could be a mixed blessing : " historically , the rise of middle classes has led to populism and dictatorships as well as pressures for greater democracy , " the authors noted			0
meanwhile , that global growth " disguises growing pressures on the middle class in @entity170 economies , " including international competition for higher - skilled jobs			2
the growing middle class will also increase demand for water and food by more than 35 % over the next couple of decades the report indicates			2
advancements in key technologies such as genetically modified crops , precision agriculture and water irrigation techniques should for the most part prevent scarcity			0
an increase in the earning power , education and political clout of women " will be a key driver of success for many countries , " with gender gaps closing fastest in @entity197 and @entity198 , the report found			1
and @entity99 is likely to be in the same position in 2030 that @entity19 is today , it concludes			0
" @entity99 's rate of economic growth is likely to rise while @entity19 's slows , " the authors found			0
@entity19 's 8 % -10 % growth " will probably be a distant memory by 2030 , " it notes			0
and @entity99 's economic advantage over regional nuclear rival @entity208 is likely to grow , roughly doubling the comparative size of its economy			0
@entity0 's @entity213 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity1 will remain the top global power , but no more " @entity33 , " a new report finds
