@entity0 -- the headline in the @entity3 left no one in any doubt			1
" @entity6 solid in @entity7			1
" the latest polls are clear -- president @entity6 will carry his home city and state and scoop up its 20 electoral college votes in his battle for re-election by a large majority			1
@entity7 will vote @entity15 , as it has for the past five elections			1
obviously @entity0 is amongst the last places to get an unbiased opinion on this year 's presidential race			1
this is the absolute heart of @entity6 country			1
it is the place where @entity6 lived and taught law			1
the city where he started his political life , first elected to the state legislature then , in a few short years , honing his policies for national office			2
full coverage : @entity1 's @entity31 @entity7 is where he announced his run for the presidency			1
four years ago , in @entity0 's @entity36 , the new president - elect @entity6 delivered his victory speech in front of tens of thousands of screaming supporters			1
so if this mid-western city is so firmly in the @entity6 camp , why am i here ? what can i hope to learn from a place so biased they should just weight his vote rather than count it ? it is the perfect place to start my @entity50 quest			1

@entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 foods are some of the global companies headquartered in the metropolitan area			0
here , they make things			0

debate analysis : @entity82 , @entity81 slug it out a crisp breeze blew in from @entity85 and a rainbow appeared in the fountain 's spray , forming a perfect arc over the magnificent skyline			2
@entity0 was putting on a show of contended bravado			2
by starting here , we gauge how the faithful view their man , before we delve into those parts of the country where the doubters , naysayers and downright critics live			1
this @entity50 quest will take us from @entity0 to the swing states of @entity105 and @entity106			1
we will sojourn in the strong @entity108 state of @entity109 , home of @entity110 , whose followers are known as @entity113			0
and we will end up in @entity114 , a state which even though it will almost certainly vote @entity15 , we can learn much of the trends for the future			2
five @entity118 : two swing			2
@entity121 was head of @entity6 's @entity122 and is now a professor in @entity0 's prestigious @entity124 at @entity125 , where @entity6 taught law			1
he told me we will find many different types of economies as we travel by rail to @entity114			0

at 9.1 % unemployment , it is above the national average and amongst the worst in the country			0
but the state 's mainstay , @entity0 , has bounced back			1
a diverse economy across services and manufacturing has helped insulate it from the severest bite of the economic chill			0
as we travel across @entity50 , @entity121 points out that we will see how the rise in commodity prices has benefited other @entity154 states like @entity105 , which should benefit the president in this swing state			1
then we will head to @entity106 , which @entity121 calls " ground zero " in the @entity163 race because of its mixture of new business and old			0
this is where the economy is being reborn through new business like health care and technology			0
map : voices from around the world but more depressingly , out of the window of our train we will see neighborhoods in @entity176 built with more optimism than pragmatism , now abandoned to economic fate and foreclosure			0
more than half the state 's homeowners are " underwater , " owing more to the banks than their properties are worth			0
we will end our journey in @entity114			0
trendsetting -- and amongst the most diverse states socially and economically			2
the @entity191 's manufacturing and high tech industries will warrant close inspection			0
this journey is more than just about " the economy , stupid " although that is by far the single biggest concern			0
expect issues of birth control , same sex marriage , gun laws and more to be on our menu			0
and throughout we will return to the comfort of our @entity206 train , to muse on our findings as we cross these @entity50			2
when i asked him what he thought of our plan to cross all of these states by rail , @entity121 said he thought we were crazy			0
