-- a global commodities trading company says it is considering a settlement to legal claims that it is responsible for the deaths of 15 people and thousands of illnesses after 500 tons of toxic waste were dumped in the @entity10 nation of @entity11			1
signs such as this were still up in " toxic zones " around @entity15 , @entity11 , a year after the waste dumping			1
the @entity18 company @entity17 said studies by 20 experts it has hired conclude that the chemicals did not harm anyone			1
" in view of that expert evidence , and the fact that claims are not being made in this litigation for deaths , miscarriages , still births , birth defects and other serious injuries , the parties are exploring the possibility of compromising the claims which have been made , " @entity17 said in a release wednesday			2
" a global settlement is being considered by the parties and it currently appears that this settlement is likely to be acceptable to most , if not all , of the claimants			0
" a @entity43 report also released wednesday said @entity17 did cause death and injury when the cargo ship @entity46 dumped 500 tons of toxic waste belonging to the company at sites around @entity15 , the @entity10 nation 's largest city			1
the incident happened in august 2006			0
" according to official estimates , 15 people died , 69 people were hospitalized and over 100,000 others , complaining of nausea and vomiting after inhaling fumes , sought medical treatment after the incident , " said the report by @entity53 , an unpaid investigator for the @entity55 - based @entity54			1
" we still do n't know -- and we may never know -- the full effect of the dumping			2
but there seems to be strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping of the waste			2
" @entity53 , who visited @entity11 and the @entity18 during his investigation , urged all parties to take steps " to address possible long - term human health and environmental effects of the incident			2
" according to a @entity43 statement , @entity53 said last month that the areas where the toxic waste was dumped still have not been decontaminated and continue to threaten residents ' health			1
many people , he said , are still reporting headaches , skin lesions , digestive difficulties and nose , throat and lung problems			0
@entity17 noted in its release wednesday that it initiated a plan two years ago that would compensate , without any admission of liability , any claimants who could demonstrate any injury caused by exposure to the waste , which the company calls " slops			1
" " the company has always maintained that the @entity46 's slops could not possibly have caused deaths and serious or long - term injuries , " @entity17 said			0
" independent expert witnesses firmly support @entity17 in this stance			0
" @entity17 also maintains it " sought to comply with all relevant regulations and procedures concerning the offloading of the @entity46 's slops in @entity15			0
" the company denies that the ship went to @entity11 solely to dump the toxic waste			1
" @entity17 has consistently stated that the @entity46 was returning from a routine commercial voyage to deliver a gasoline cargo in @entity117 , @entity118 , when it stopped in @entity15 , " the company statement said			1
" consequently , any suggestion that the vessel was sent to @entity10 solely for the purpose of offloading its slops is entirely inaccurate			0
" as one of the largest independent companies trading commodities , @entity17 has 1,900 employees in 42 nations , the company 's web site says			0
" we handle every element involved in the sourcing and trading of crude oil , petroleum products , renewable energies , metals , metal ores and concentrates for industrial consumers			0
@entity11 , a former @entity141 colony with a population of 20 million , is also known as @entity11 .			0
