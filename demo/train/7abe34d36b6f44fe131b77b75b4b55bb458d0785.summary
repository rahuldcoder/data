-- just about every time an article about " sugar " is published , i get frustrated because of the effort by some to falsely target sugar			1
although reporters often ask the @entity10 for scientific facts and data regarding sugar to use in their stories , the information we provide is rarely included			2
often , it 's completely ignored because it does not support the preconceived focus of their article			0
thus , a tremendous amount of factual , scientifically verified information about all - natural sugar ( sucrose ) is being left out of today 's conversation			1
and , sugar , the natural version , is too often confused with the more prevalent man - made sweeteners like high - fructose corn syrup			1
that 's misleading for consumers			2
and it 's bad for advancing a real debate about solving the serious problem of obesity in @entity36			0
opinion : the sweet secret that could kill you i 'm talking about a legitimate , credible discussion , supported by government data and independent scientific research , not hysteria and misinformation			0
those using inflammatory and baseless phrases like " toxic " are often more concerned with a sound bite to sensationalize an article or tv appearance , and their claims have more to do with boosting their social media following or selling books than resolving genuine issues of public health			1
targeting sugar alone is disingenuous , at best			0
the most recent example of this trend is a study that appeared in the journal @entity61 , and the media storm that ensued , condemning sugar as a contributing factor to cardiovascular disease			1
consider this : the authors of the study itself concede that an observational study like theirs is not proof of cause and effect			0
the authors fail to note the weakness of the self - reported data they used to estimate intake levels of " added sugar			1
" this inadequacy is demonstrated by the fact that study participants self - reporting higher levels of physical activity had a greater , not the expected lower , risk of cardiovascular disease			0
and the study 's authors also simplistically lumped together all caloric sweeteners as " added sugar " rather than identifying them individually ( more on this in a minute )			0
yet that did n't stop headlines like " @entity10 tied to fatal heart problems " or " eating too much sugar may be killing you			2
" @entity10 not only makes you fat , it may make you sick these headlines -- and many others resulting from the study -- underscore the problem consumers are facing when seeking factual information on health			1
having worked with the @entity36 sugar industry for more than a decade , i am becoming more and more dismayed by those habitually providing a megaphone for what " some " folks are saying while barely giving a thought to whether these claims reflect a consensus view that is either prevailing among qualified experts or is scientifically correct			0
although obsessing about sugar as " the " problem in our diets gives headline writers everywhere the chance to grab our attention with provocative puns , it undermines the worth of important work regarding other dietary and health concerns			2
it takes the focus and resources away from us supporting scientifically verified , proven interventions dealing with obesity			0
the fact is that @entity36 per capita consumption of real sugar ( sucrose ) is lower now than it was 40 years ago by approximately one - third ( 34 % )			1
so of all the things we need to worry about in this world , " higher " consumption of sugar is not among them			0
because we 've been consuming less of it for decades			0
and when critics talk about consumption of " sugar - sweetened " or " sugary beverages , " they are often inaccurately lumping sugar -- from sugar cane and sugar beets -- with man - made sweeteners like high - fructose corn syrup			1
sugar and high - fructose corn syrup , for example , are different sweeteners			1
with @entity36 @entity157 data showing that more than 90 % of the caloric sweetener used in beverages in the @entity36 is such corn syrup , not sugar , how can the media , or anyone , continue to call them " sugar - sweetened beverages " ? so @entity36 just need to remember : only sucrose , or sugar , is sugar			1
sugar has been consumed safely for centuries and , when consumed in moderation , has been and should continue to be part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			2

@entity176 says media reports involving natural sugar are often misleading
@entity176 contends recent studies linking *excess* sugar to poor health are inadequate
too often , he argues , headlines confuse sucrose -- or sugar -- with high - fructose corn syrup
