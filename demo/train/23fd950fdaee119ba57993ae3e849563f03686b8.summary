-- the @entity1 called it the " @entity3			1
" to the @entity5 , it was the " @entity6			2
" no one wanted to think there could be a second			2
though @entity3 , which began 100 years ago next month , devastated lives and landscapes , its effect on language was almost paradoxically positive			1
it spawned hundreds of new words and popularized scores of old ones			1
many of them survive today -- there are " cooties , " " camouflage , " " scrounge " and " dud , " for example -- but many have lost their once - widely recognized associations with the war that was hoped would " end war			1
" total war , as the world twice found out in the past century , is a turbulent time			1
it is for language , too			2
as new concerns , new methods , new technologies and new experiences multiply , vocabulary by necessity tries to keep up			0
obscure old words can get a new lease on life			1
@entity3 gave the @entity44 language new terms as varied as " blimp " and " @entity47 " and " devil dog " and even " @entity49			1
" it popularized military slang like " doughboy " and " fed up			1
" it dragooned older terms for wider application , such as " @entity56 " and " no - man 's land			0
" some words prominent in 1914 - 18 have pretty much fallen from use			2
others remain as well - known as the war 's idealistic slogans , like @entity64 ' call for " a war to end wars " and @entity67 's to make the world " safe for democracy			1
" as a multilingual war , it promptly enriched the @entity44 language with terms of international origin			0
air reconnaissance made military and naval " camouflage , " another @entity77 word , a necessity			0
the same might be said of the @entity80 cocktail , named for the war 's most effective artillery piece			0
and historians writing in @entity44 still use the @entity85 " poilu " for a @entity77 combat soldier and " @entity47 " for the @entity87			0
older terms and nicknames sometimes gained new popularity that guaranteed they 'd remain in @entity44 long after soldiers returned home			0
@entity95 's smash hit " @entity104 " ( 1917 ) was the catchiest @entity97 patriotic song ever , and when he wrote that " the @entity5 are coming , " he followed the @entity98 , not the @entity97 , use of the @entity101 term to encompass all @entity97 , north and south of the @entity103			0
" doughboy " was a new one on most people , but it had meant an infantryman since the @entity108 of the 1840s , for no very clear reason ; now , it 's the usual synonym for the @entity97 soldier of the @entity3			1
" @entity119 , " which also looked new but was n't , denoted the @entity114 , whose 19th - century uniform had featured a high leather collar that sailors ridiculed			0
opinion : how a century - old war affects you a @entity125 newspaper claimed in 1918 that the @entity87 thought @entity97 @entity114 fought like @entity126 , or " devil dogs " ; the supposedly @entity129 word sounds ersatz , but the @entity44 version is still heard in the @entity131			0
( sailors were " gobs " ; fliers were " birdmen " ; pals were " buddies " : all pre-war , all truly mainstream for the first time in 1914 - 18			2
) " @entity142 , " which meant only " galvanized iron " and " government issue " in @entity3 , eventually became the @entity140 term for a @entity97 soldier			1
the everyday life of those soldiers spawned many words and expressions			2
when kids talk of " cooties , " they do n't realize what everyone knew by 1918 : it was a new term for lice , which burrowed into the clothes of any and all who served on the front lines			0
" @entity163 , " for food , owes its popularity mostly to the @entity97 military of @entity3 from the @entity98 came the expressions " to scrounge " ( to search for and , if necessary , pilfer ) , " cushy " ( enviably comfortable ) and " fed up " ( disgusted with it all ) , three salient soldier concepts in any war			1
trench warfare became a sinister science , as front - line troops of every army hunkered down for hundreds of miles in conditions of appalling filth and danger			1
playwright @entity177 , an opponent of the war , popularized the once - uncommon phrase " cannon fodder , " which suggested that soldiers of all nations had been impersonally requisitioned to feed the guns or duped into enlisting by interchangeably imperialist rulers			2
to name what lay between the entrenched armies , modern @entity44 enlisted a phrase from the @entity188 : " no - man 's land			2
" the shell - pocked muck between the opposing trenches , bounded by rotting sandbags and rusted heaps of barbed wire , gave the 14th - century meaning of " unowned or uninhabited territory " a much grimmer connotation			0
before @entity3 , a " dud " was anything or anybody unsatisfactory , but by the time the conflict ended , " dud " referred chiefly to an unexploded shell or bomb , as it does to this day			1
the @entity98 began speaking of defensive " foxholes , " dug not by foxes but by soldiers on the battlefield , a word that now may seem as old as shooting wars themselves			0
the adjustment of a rifle 's battle - sight was " zeroing in , " a metaphor today 's @entity44 ca n't do without			0
then there 's " d - day " : the very first was september 26 , 1918 , the starting date of the war - ending @entity216 offensive in the @entity218			0
familiar now as an advertising platform , the helium - filled " blimp " was invented for naval observation in 1915			2
the @entity98 came up with the armored " tank " and named it arbitrarily to keep the weapon secret before its surprise appearance in the @entity228 in 1916			0
the threat of " chemical warfare " and " chemical weapons " had been discussed in the press , but their actual use by @entity87 in 1915 , first in @entity235 and then in @entity236 , raised the war 's quotient of barbarism			2
the @entity240 quickly followed suit			0
" @entity245 raids , " which began on a small scale in 1914 , were carried out by four - winged bombers and @entity129 zeppelins			0
the idea of bomb - laden squadrons of @entity243 over @entity250 may seem like something from @entity253 science fiction , and it was novelist @entity64 ( author of " @entity256 " ) who invented the most ominous phrase of all			1
in 1914 , he imagined a device that might appear within a generation , whose destructive power would change everything forever			0
@entity64 warned that eventually " any little body of malcontents could use it			1
" as though in prophecy of the long shadow the 1914 - 18 war would cast on the 20th century , @entity64 coined a now - familiar term for his imaginary superweapon that he believed could easily " wreck half a city			1
" he called it " the atomic bomb			1

@entity277 : @entity3 brought slew of new words into use to express the turbulent time
" @entity283 , " " tanks , " " doughboy " , " fed up , " " dud , " " trench warfare " and many more , he says
lighter says @entity64 invented most ominous phrase of all : " the atomic bomb "
