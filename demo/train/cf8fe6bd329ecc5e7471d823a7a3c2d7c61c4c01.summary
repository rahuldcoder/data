-- at the stroke of midnight , @entity2 beer drinkers were no longer breaking the law when they broke open a beer			1
brewers and beer lovers this weekend are toasting the return of legal brew 75 years ago			1
breweries and beer lovers around the country are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the return of beer on april 7 , 1933 , as the @entity17 era was drawing to a close			1
it was n't quite the end of @entity17 , and it was n't quite beer , but after 14 thirsty years , it was close enough			1
what became available that day was only 3.2 percent alcohol by weight ( compared with up to 5 percent in full - strength beer ) , but still , it was a step up from the virtually alcohol - free " near beer " that had been sold since 1920			1
" it 's a big deal			2
... the whole industry of beer has gotten together to say this date is definitely historic , " said @entity30 , spokeswoman for the @entity31 , which represents smaller " craft " brewers			1
in @entity37 , @entity38 , megabrewer @entity39 is throwing a big bash , complete with historical exhibits and an appearance by the company 's famous @entity44 horses			2
also in @entity37 , but on a more intimate scale , @entity46 is inviting folks to come out to its bottleworks for a festival next weekend			2
remnants of @entity17 survive today in the form of state - owned liquor stores and local laws that , for example , prevent sales of alcohol on sundays or in grocery stores			1
some counties remain entirely dry , banning alcohol sales altogether , and 3.2 beer is still sold in six states ( @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity38 , @entity66 and @entity67 ) , according to @entity69 magazine			1
and there are those who think a beer - related anniversary is nothing to celebrate			1
" it is the product of choice for underage drinking , " said @entity74 , advocacy director for the @entity75 , an alcohol industry watchdog group			2
" we 're not neo-prohibitionists or teetotalers , " he said			2
" we 're not trying to tell adults what to do			2
" he said his group just wants the industry to operate more responsibly			0
the crowds celebrating the anniversary are unlikely to match the size or enthusiasm of those that gathered around breweries all over the country on " @entity94 , " april 6 , 1933 , in anticipation of the return of legal beer that actually had some alcohol in it			1
" there was dancing in the streets and lines outside brewery doors ... it was a big date , for sure , " @entity30 said			0
@entity104 had been president barely a month , having been sworn in on march 4 after a landslide victory the previous november			0
sweeping into power with him was an @entity109 majority in @entity110 known as " the wets			0
" together they fulfilled their first campaign promise with passage of the @entity115 , which increased the amount of alcohol allowed in beverages from 0.5 percent to a discernible 3.2 percent by weight			0
when the act took effect at 12:01 a.m. et april 7 , trucks and carriages burst out of brewery gates bearing cases and barrels of beer for a parched republic -- at least for the @entity129 and the 20 states whose laws permitted it			1
several breweries dispatched cases directly to the @entity135 and the @entity136			0
according to the @entity31 , more than 1.5 million barrels were snapped up in the first 24 hours			0
full - strength beer and hard liquor were still a few months away			1
national prohibition was n't repealed until the 21st amendment to the @entity142 was ratified on december 5			0
@entity143 , author of eight books about beer , including " @entity146 : an @entity150 , " holds that the december date is more significant and that the quickly brewed april 7 beer probably was of poor quality			1
" i know everyone gets excited about it , but you were offered a watered - down version of beer			1
that 's all you got , " @entity143 said			0
" it probably was n't a very satisfying drink			0
if you wanted to have a shot [ of hard liquor ] on the side , you still had to wait until december 5th for that to happen			0
" but the celebration was about more than getting a buzz			0
according to a contemporary article in the @entity170 , the revival of the brewing industry restored at least 50,000 jobs in the midst of the @entity173 , instantly breathing life into the economies of @entity37 ; @entity176 , @entity177 ; @entity178 , @entity179 ; and other cities and towns where breweries were large employers			1
" april 7th was really just ... @entity104 looking for an economic shot in the arm , " @entity143 said			2
" and it was a very successful shot in the arm			0
there was a hell of a lot of money spent			0
" he said $ 25 million was pumped into breweries and associated businesses -- helping farmers , truckers , and glassmakers as well as brewers and pubs -- in the first 48 hours of sales			0
and that was good for cash - strapped governments , too			0
" everybody [ in government ] , for the first time , started to wrap their heads around the notion that this is something that you could tax , " he said			0
the first day of beer sales reaped $ 7.5 million in tax receipts for the @entity213 , he noted			2
about half the nation 's breweries went out of business during @entity17 , but others survived by converting to products such as oleomargarine , ice cream , cheese and smoked ham			1
so at the @entity226 brewery in @entity176 , for example , children could enjoy a sundae while @entity228 or @entity229 slipped away to a room where illicit beer was served from a hidden tap , according to the @entity234 's web site			2
yes , despite @entity17 , @entity2 could go for the gusto			1
@entity178 had as many as 20,000 speakeasies , @entity143 said			0
" if you could n't find a beer during @entity17 , " he said , " you really were n't trying			1
