@entity0 -- internships can be crucial career - builders			2
but what if you ca n't afford to work for free all summer ? @entity6 of @entity7 may have found the solution			2
after securing a prestigious unpaid student internship in the office of @entity12 leader @entity11 , a @entity7 @entity13 , she has begun a crowdfunding appeal online			2
she is asking donors to help pay for her housing , transportation , and food , which she estimates will cost her $ 6,500 over the four months in the capital			1
" if i do n't reach my goal , " she writes in her appeal , " i will be forced to relinquish this opportunity and miss out on this once in a lifetime chance			0
" as of tuesday , online donors had already chipped in enough for half of her costs			2
some observers say there is some irony here , given that plenty of lawmakers are pushing to raise the minimum wage , yet do n't pay a cent to some of their hardest workers			1
" of everybody in the federal government , only @entity39 is allowed to use unpaid interns , " says @entity37 , a former unpaid intern who is now an activist with the @entity38			1
" they have explicitly written an exemption for themselves into the law			0
" and it 's not just @entity39			1
private employers in @entity0 and across the country can offer internships without pay			1
( disclosure : @entity1 pays its interns			2
) @entity37 warns that because only affluent students can afford to work for free , many students will be denied a crucial career experience			1
" it is excluding the vast majority of people who can not afford to work for free , or have their parents afford for their children to work for free , " he said			0
" it also promotes inequality			0
" @entity37 worked for free as an intern on the movie " @entity66 , " but later successfully sued the movie studio , claiming that it was not fair that he was paid nothing			0
" employers think that if they slap the word intern on a job then they do n't have to pay for it , " he said			1
" why do people think they can get away with this ? " but at a time of elevated unemployment , and government spending cuts , it may be difficult to persuade employers to pay minimum wage			1
and requiring all interns to be paid could have a downside , according to @entity83 at the @entity84			0
" if we mandate that all internships must be paid , and then we have fewer internships , i do n't think that helps anyone , " he said			0
plus , he said , while internships often involve menial work , they also provide valuable experience and interesting work , and should not be jeopardized with new requirements			1
" these are internships that dozens or hundreds of people would really pine for			0
" indeed , one intern , with the publication " the @entity102 , " had a chance to ask a question at the daily @entity106 briefing last month			0
and several interns for news outlets became famous during the live coverage of the @entity111 's biggest decisions in june , as they sprinted out of the court holding the papers that announced how the court ruled on the @entity115 and same - sex marriage			0
the spectacle was nicknamed " @entity118			0
" and the value of internships on a resume is something undergraduates are keenly aware of			1
" all i hear from the career center at school is , internships are almost a necessary thing , " says @entity125 , a student at @entity126 , who scored a ( paid ) internship with a lobbying firm in @entity102 " your resume needs to have internships on it or you are way , way behind , " she said .			2

one intern turns to *web* to raise money to cover housing , food costs
@entity39 only area of government allowed to have unpaid interns
but private employers can offer *similar* work without pay
value of internships on a resume is something students are keenly aware of
