-- @entity1 knows the value of a good education			0
she 's a career woman who poured years of her life into studying to become a certified public accountant with an mba			0
but after nearly two decades climbing the corporate ladder in @entity9 , the 46 - year - old stopped managing employees and began micromanaging her two daughters			2
instead of overseeing company accounts , @entity12 organizes piano lessons , sat preparation courses and @entity17 homework assignments			0
she wants to give her daughters a shot at a top - notch college education			1
" i had a very good , promising career , " @entity12 said			0
" but it was n't as important as making sure my kids did well and just setting them up for the future			0
" stay - at - home parenting is nothing new			2
about 5.1 million mothers stay at home full time , according to the @entity32			2
but @entity12 's decision to quit her job came at an unconventional time -- when her children were grown teenagers and had entered high school			1
unlike maternity leave , think of @entity12 's time off as a college - prep leave , say college admissions counselors			1
she represents a group of highly educated mothers who are sacrificing careers to usher their children through the increasingly competitive college admissions process			1
there are no statistics counting how many mothers compromise their careers to help their teens with college admissions , but college counselors say they 've witnessed more cases of mothers pausing their jobs or completely quitting their jobs			1
over the past five years , @entity61 , president of @entity62 , says she saw a 10 percent uptick in mothers who quit or postponed their career to get their teens into college			1
her counseling company offers services in 32 states			0
these mothers , who can afford to quit their jobs , may stop working for months , a year or several years leading up to the admission process , say researchers and college admissions counselors			1
they reduce their full - time hours to part time or request a temporary leave			1
because many of them have jobs that require advanced degrees and specific skills , it 's usually easier for them to transition back into the work force			1
" they know it 's going to be an intense year and they take a leave to that effect , " @entity61 said			2
" the college frenzy has affected the entire family			2
" since the mid- 1990s , there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of time college - educated mothers are spending with their older children , according to a march study from the @entity97			1
women spent six hours a week on child care in the mid- 1990s , but that number jumped to about 12 hours a week after 2005 , the study said			2
@entity106 professors @entity102 and @entity103 , who headed the @entity97 study , theorized the rising amount of time spent on child care by a parent likely is associated with difficulty in the college admission process and juggling college preparatory activities			1
they found that college - educated parents have more resources and are better equipped to help their children with the process			1
" we were shocked to find other mothers who had graduate degrees and had given up their careers and devoted their time to their children , " said @entity103			1
the panic of getting her 17 - year - old daughter into a highly ranked university hit @entity126 hard			2
@entity126 , 56 , of @entity127 , @entity128 , holds two master 's degrees in counseling that took her nearly 5Â½ years to earn			2
but a year - and - a - half ago , during daughter 's junior year in high school , she put her private counseling practice on hold to help her through the college application process			1
junior year is a crunch time for high schoolers , as they compile college wish lists and tour campuses			1
she became her daughter 's college applications manager , scheduling campus tours and researching academic programs			2
she also became a videographer , recording her 17 - year - old at each college visit as she weighed the pros and cons in front of each school			1
@entity126 has three older children , ages 25 , 23 , and 19 , but she said this is the first time she stopped working , because she saw that expectations of high school students had grown since her eldest child entered college			1
@entity126 said it is a dilemma			0
" we can be seen by others and , more importantly , by ourselves , as ' irresponsible ' for not taking an active role in our child 's application process , or as driven and overprotective if we do get involved			1
" she was relieved to learn this month that her daughter had been accepted by her top choice , @entity169			0
she immediately reopened her practice , which was crucial , she said , because she had gone into debt during her time off			2
managing a child 's college application process can be similar to a corporate job , says @entity176 , a fellow at @entity177 who specializes in family studies			1
@entity176 conducted dozens of interviews with mothers who stopped working and stayed at home for their children			0
she says she talked to mothers who used their @entity185 devices to organize schedules and help their teens craft resumes			0
" raising the child sometimes becomes a career in itself , " @entity176 said			0
" instead of getting a promotion and measuring progress in professional sense , a way to measure how well you are doing is how well your child is doing			0
" but guiding a teen is a very different experience than raising a newborn or young child , say some mothers who have given up their advanced degrees to become full - time moms			1
several moms say their decision to stay at home with their teens as allowed them to strengthen those relationships			2
@entity208 , 57 , of @entity209 , @entity128 , found herself sharing special moments with her daughter when the stress of writing essays became too daunting			0
together , they would take a break and enjoy an episode of a reality tv show together			0
" if i had to do it all over again , i would do the same thing , " said @entity217 , who put her career in family law on hold for four months last fall			0
she said she considers her decision a success : her daughter is juggling admissions offers from four selective colleges			0
even so , she said , her daughter probably could have gotten through the process without her			0
for @entity1 in @entity9 , her relationship with her college - bound high school senior also deepened			1
@entity12 does miss getting dressed up for work and commuting into bustling @entity233 , but her decision has eased the stress on her family			0
her husband continues to work			0
" we wanted to make sure we could give her all the tools she needed to succeed , " @entity12 said			0
her eldest daughter is headed to @entity241 this fall			0
but the family 's college admissions process will start all over again when the youngest daughter , who is in high school , begins eyeing colleges			1
and @entity12 will be staying at home .			0
