@entity0 , @entity1 -- thirty - year - old @entity3 is walking through what she hopes will soon be her new living room			1
@entity3 is trying to buy her first home with help from the federal @entity8			1
" the carpet 's clearly trashed , but that 's going to get ripped out , " she says			2
she 's excited to become a first - time homebuyer and has been shopping exclusively for foreclosed homes in the @entity0 , @entity1 , area for several weeks now			1
" it 's the @entity16 dream , " @entity3 says of home ownership , and she 's just zeroed in on the one she wants to be hers			2
she has a bid in and is waiting to hear on her offer			2
financially strapped prospective buyers like @entity20 have discovered hope in the @entity8 , a year - old federal program designed to help stabilize communities decimated by foreclosures and abandonment			1
families and individuals who qualify can get a loan of up to $ 15,000 to cover down payment and closing costs of foreclosed homes			1
the amount varies by region , but can amount to tens of thousands of dollars			2
@entity34 approved the nationwide program in july 2008 , pumping a total of $ 3.92 billion into the hardest - hit communities			1
almost $ 2 billion more was allocated in may			2
a total of $ 121 million in funding arrived in @entity1 in april , and the @entity0 area received the largest cut , approximately $ 39.4 million			1
program watch dogs are keeping their eyes on states like @entity1 to see how the money will be spent and whether it will make a difference			1
@entity1 had the fourth highest rate of new foreclosures in may , according to @entity50			1
with such a high foreclosure rate , the funds allocated to @entity1 , and in particular the @entity0 area , were significant			1
however , not one home in @entity0 has been purchased using the @entity8 funds despite hundreds of applications			1
people are still trying to navigate an unfamiliar process , housing experts in @entity0 say			1
@entity3 would be thrilled to be the first person to close on a home			0
she is single and works as a project manager at a @entity64 asset management company			0
however , she currently has no savings			0
after recently providing financial assistance to a relative -- a move that depleted her bank account -- @entity3 admits she never thought she 'd be able to afford a home of her own any time soon			1
she 's unable to meet the 3.5 percent down payment required for the most affordable government - backed home loans ; therefore , she had resigned herself to paying rent until she was able to recoup her savings			1
that 's when a friend , @entity77 , a @entity78 , told @entity79			0
" my realtor filled me in on it , and then i did some research on it and decided that would probably be the best route to take , " @entity3 says			0
the program is limited to applicants with incomes between $ 55,350 and $ 104,400 , depending on family size , according to the @entity90			1
the income limits vary from region to region			0
applicants must also complete eight hours of financial counseling and courses in budgeting and home ownership , and be able to invest $ 1,000 of their own money			1
under the @entity8 , @entity90 requires the lender to give buyers a 15 % discount below the appraised value and the loan must be paid back in full when the homeowner sells the home or refinances			0
lenders are not required , however , to accept a discounted offer			0
once approved for the maximum loan , @entity3 wasted little time in locating and bidding on a property she liked			1
although @entity3 's bid was $ 30,000 less than the listing price , offers like hers are common in the @entity0 area			0
on any given day in 2009 , real estate listings can show more than 25,000 foreclosed single family homes available			1
@entity3 said , " i 'd be disappointed " if the bank turned down her offer			0
@entity3 has good credit , and so she qualified for a $ 275,000 fixed - rate mortgage using the approved federal funds			1
she believes taking the mandated classes taught her the importance of personal affordability			0
" i liked the programs , the counseling and things like that that teach you not to live outside your means ... i do n't want to be house poor , " @entity3 said			0
under the scenario of her bid , @entity3 would only have to come up with about $ 1,500 on her own for earnest money and appraisal costs			1
if approved , her monthly mortgage payment would actually be $ 180 less than what she is paying to rent for a two - bedroom , 900 - square foot apartment			1
@entity77 has been in the @entity0 real estate market for about nine years and has seen the disastrous real estate downturn up close			0
he hopes to soon see more clients using @entity8 funding			0
" it 's just kind of coming out now that people are understanding it 's there			0
i do n't think they have done a very big promotion ... put it on billboards or anything like that to say , ' hey , this is available to you , ' " @entity77 said			0
until now , @entity77 said , @entity159 - savvy house hunters have had to discover the program on their own			1
experts want to caution those who think the @entity8 will solve @entity0 's devastated real estate market			2
@entity164 , president of @entity165 , @entity1 - based @entity166 , a nonprofit that helps people find affordable housing , says that wo n't happen			1
" we have to identify those goals , those strategies and those resources that are going to make a difference , " he says			0
" this is not , in and of itself , going to do that			0
" he compares the program to a @entity180 , cautioning , " it is only one tool ... we 're going to have to find some other solutions to stabilize these communities			2
" communities are visibly ailing all across the area , with some of the hardest - hit neighborhoods nearly abandoned by foreclosures			2
homes are boarded up and weeds cover the " @entity192 " and " for rent " signs in thousands of yards			2
" it 's overwhelming when you look at the numbers , " @entity164 said , noting that @entity0 still records roughly 8,000 new foreclosure notices every month			2
@entity164 estimates the loan program will probably help only about 1,000 families acquire homes across the @entity0 metro area			1
nonprofit housing assistance programs such as @entity164 's are available in many cities across the country to educate and counsel prospective home buyers and inform them of available assistance			2
however , @entity164 cautions it 's not just about quick ownership			0
" we just do n't want houses to be bought and sold			0
we want families to invest and develop affordable , sustainable home ownership throughout the community			0
" @entity164 urges patience and warns it will take full cooperation for all sectors to turn the housing crisis around			0
" we have to encourage the private sector , the banking industry , the mortgage industry to also get involved and provide product that makes it possible for families to buy houses			2
it all ca n't be federal money , " @entity164 said			1
less than 24 hours after submitting her bid , @entity3 received a call from the bank			0
after watching the property sit foreclosed and idle on the market for almost two months , she was informed that someone else beat her bid by only a few hours			0
despite the funding assistance , @entity3 quickly learned there are no assurances or guarantees in the federally funded home buying process			0
she later found two more places she likes and placed bids on them			0
she hopes one of the banks will come through quickly and make her a new homeowner , the first to use funds from the @entity8 .			2

@entity1 has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country
federal program makes funds available to first - time homebuyers
experts unsure if many applicants can be helped
no money has yet been used to help purchase homes
