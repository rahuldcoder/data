every dog has its day , and scientists are trying to figure out when that first day happened			0
at some point in ancient history humans developed close relationships with four - legged creatures that would have otherwise been wild , fierce wolves			2
a new study in the journal @entity9 argues that the domestication of dogs happened between 18,800 and 32,100 years ago in @entity12			1
they say @entity12 hunter - gatherer cultures were responsible for turning lupine foes into best friends , long before humans developed agriculture			1
it 's a conclusion that barks up a controversial tree			0
the study goes against the idea wolves were domesticated when they wandered over to human agricultural settlements , lured by food			1
the study also contradicts previous research suggesting that dog domestication may have first happened in the @entity28 or @entity29			1
" there were many aspects in this study that we did n't expect , " said @entity30 , researcher at @entity32 's @entity31 , who led the study			2
chief among the surprises : the @entity12 origin of dog domestication			1
digging up bones seeking to sniff out when and where domesticated dogs emerged , scientists turned to genetics			1
researchers extracted and sequenced mitochondrial dna			2
mitochondria are structures in cells that convert food energy into usable forms			0
when working with these ancient samples , scientists focused on mitochondrial dna because it is more prevalent in cells than @entity48 within a cell 's nucleus			0
scientists recovered dna fragments from the genomes of 18 prehistoric dog and wolf - like carnivores and 20 modern wolves with origins in @entity67 and @entity68			2
researchers compared these mitochondrial genome sequences with those of 49 wolves , 77 modern dogs , 3 @entity75 indigenous dogs and 4 coyotes			1
by highlighting similarities in dna sequences among all of these specimens , researchers put together trees of close relationships called " clades			2
" the more similar two creatures ' sequences are , the closer together they will be in the clade			0
researchers organized the specimens in the study into four clades , with three of these groups having sister species represented by ancient fossils from @entity12 , and the fourth relating to modern wolves as well			1
it appears , based on these groupings , that the oldest domesticated dogs were in @entity12			1
the carcasses that ancient hunters left behind may have attracted wolves , which could have led to a relationship between dogs and humans , study authors said			1
a group called @entity107 includes examples of the modern dog breeds @entity110 and @entity111 , as well as some @entity113 dogs as old as 8,500 years			1
the ancient dogs of the @entity115 seem to have already been domesticated when they got there , having arrived with humans , @entity30 said			1
" what we propose is actually the process that led to dog domestication in @entity12 also gave rise ... ( to ) dogs in the @entity113			1
" @entity107 demographically shows a connection with humans			0
between 5,000 and 2,500 years ago dog population declined , but then began to rise sharply starting about 2,500 years ago , said @entity30			1
human population size also went up at that time , indicating that dogs were dependent demographically on the human societies , he said			2
meanwhile , wolves became more scarce , as agrarian cultures emerged and wolves lost their habitats and wild game			0
surprisingly , researchers did not find a population of modern wolves that might have given rise to modern dogs			1
in fact , modern dogs have more genetically in common with ancient wolves than the ones we see today			0
" it 's quite likely that the population of wolves that gave rise to modern dogs does not exist anymore , " @entity30 said			0
dogs vs. wolves another big surprise from the study is , based on mitochondrial dna , the two most ancient samples of dog - like creatures included in this study did n't seem to be dogs at all			1
one of the oldest samples was previously described in a 2011 study in the journal @entity160 , led by @entity161 , a co-author on the new science study			2
@entity161 and colleagues described remains of a " dog - like " creature from @entity167 in @entity168 , about 33,000 years old , and found similarities between it and domesticated dogs from @entity172 that lived about 1,000 years ago			1
but the new study 's genetic analysis suggests that this particular sample is an ancient sister lineage to modern dogs and wolves , not a direct ancestor			2
a 36,000 - year - old dog - like carnivore found in @entity182 does not seem to represent a direct ancestor either			0
" we did not expect that these two particular dogs -- the putative earliest dogs -- that they 're not directly related to modern dogs , " that 's not something the study authors expected , @entity30 said			2
so what 's going on ? there are two theories about what happened to these creatures , @entity30 said			0
it 's possible that both of these fossils represent early attempts of humans to domesticate dog - like animals			0
these creatures did not appear to leave any descendents , so they may signify a failure of domestication			0
alternatively , these creatures may not have been domesticated at all , but rather unusual wolves that died out before the last @entity207			0
more recent specimens -- such as a 14,700 - year - old fossil from the @entity211 site in @entity212 , @entity213 , and the 12,500 - year - old fossil from @entity213 's @entity216 cave -- seem to be more directly related to modern dogs			2
scientists previously had evidence based on their physical features , but the new mitochondrial genome analysis adds more support , @entity30 said			0
by 14,000 years ago , " dogs had become a consistent component of human settlements and were subject to deliberate burial themselves and were included in human graves , " the @entity160 study said			1
on the scent of other theories this new study does n't present the whole story , however			2
it did not include ancient samples from the @entity28 or @entity75 , which are alternative proposals for the origins of dog domestication			0
@entity30 anticipates that this will be a criticism of the study			0
also , regarding wolves , the study included fewer wolf samples from the @entity28 and @entity29 than other areas , potentially skewing that part of the analysis as well			0
but , notes the study 's senior author @entity246 , a biologist at the @entity248 , @entity249 , the oldest dog fossils from @entity29 are no more than 8,000 years old , making them much younger than the @entity12 samples and dating from well after the domestication of dogs			1
the oldest @entity28 dog remains are between 10,000 and 12,000 years old , and so still more recent than the @entity12 fossils			1
mitochondrial dna from ancient canines from these areas would make for a more complete picture of canine evolution , but it was not available in this study			0
if a 20,000 - year - old dog fossil were available from these areas , scientists would also need to find other fossils to arrange them in a tree of relationships , @entity30 said			0
if those were genetically more closely related to modern dogs than the @entity12 samples , that would argue for a different origin of domestication -- but such samples have not been recovered			1
this result seems unlikely , given the close associations found between modern dogs and ancient @entity12 wolves and dogs , @entity246 said			1
many questions remain about the first domesticated canines			0
they may be dog - gone , but science is making sure they 're not forgotten			0

study : dogs were domesticated between 18,800 and 32,100 years ago
@entity12 hunter - gatherer cultures domesticated dogs , researchers say
this contradicts other previously held theories
