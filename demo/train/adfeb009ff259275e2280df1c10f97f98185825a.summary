-- about a year ago , a group of my closest friends got together in a basement apartment in @entity5			1
it was a saturday night in the dead of winter , and most of us were broke ( the economy was crashing ) and lazy ( we did n't feel like trekking to a bar in the city )			1
as we cracked open a bottle of wine and ate fresh - baked zucchini muffins , one of my friends decided to play us some records on the record player he had recently inherited from his parents			1
it turned out to be one of the best nights of our lives			0
in sharing great music , great food and great fun , a tradition was born : @entity29			1
the @entity30 is finally catching on to something my friends and i discovered that night ; vinyl is back in a major way			1
the stats say that cds are becoming just about as obsolete as cassettes and 8 - tracks			0
sure , ipods are fun if you 're on the go , but really the only way to devour your favorite music ( other than to hear it live ) is to listen to it on vinyl			0
it 's like hearing the music again for the first time -- rich and layered			0
@entity50 , a bigwig at @entity51 , said , " it is absolutely easy to say vinyl does n't make sense when you look at convenience , portability , all those things			1
but all the really great stuff in our lives comes from a root of passion or love			1
" [ @entity30 ] that 's what @entity29 is really all about			0
but do n't take my word for it			1
here are five tips for throwing your own rocking @entity29			0
yes , you need a record player			1
i know you 're thinking , " where on earth do i get a record player ? the antique shop ? " try @entity76 or @entity77			1
there are so many used record players that need a good home			1
from bottom of the line models to high - end turntables , you would n't believe how many people have record players			1
if you 're an electronics idiot like me , you may want to consult a knowledgeable person			0
i always ask my super-geeky musician friends about makes , models and features			2
if you do n't have a music nerd in your life , do a little research online or find a specialty store in your area			2
also , do n't forget to get some great speakers so you can hear all the natural flava of your records			1
starting a record collection is n't as hard or as expensive as you think			1
it 's always fun to go to a local record store and pick out some delicious vinyl			2
many record stores have used records , which can save you some money			1
take the record out and make sure that it 's the right record -- one time i got " @entity114 " record in a " @entity116 " jacket			2
also , make sure that the record is not terribly scratched			2
if you 're a bargain hunter like me , go to your local thrift store and pick through			0
you may have to search for a while , but it 's not uncommon to find some $ 1 gems			1
also , flea markets are a great place to find some hot , cheap vinyl			2
keep the guest list small			0
the best thing about @entity29 is reveling in your favorite music and breaking out your finest dance moves			0
this is always most fun with close friends who have similar tastes in music			2
but part of the fun is also learning about new music , so you may want to require guests to bring some records of their own			1
food and drinks are a must			0
it 's hard to throw a great record party without food and beverage			1
snacks and drinks will be much appreciated when guests step off the makeshift dance floor			2
establish some rules and traditions			0
at our @entity29 , we 've established a couple of rules in order to keep the good times rolling : 1			2
everyone must write all requests down on our request list			0
no more than two songs played at one time per person			0
after everyone has put in a request , the cycle starts over			0
everyone gets one " @entity168 " per night			0
a " @entity168 " is when you have a great song that you feel like you need to push to the top of the list			0
develop your own rules and traditions to ensure that everyone is able to share in the music			0

record parties are a great way to get together with friends
instead of an @entity184 , get better sound with a record player , available on @entity76 or @entity77
records can be inexpensive : $ 1 gems are n't too rare to *stumble* upon
bring snacks and a *playlist*
