-- when @entity3 law firm operations director @entity2 was due for a well - earned vacation , he booked himself a first - class ticket to @entity6 on @entity7			1
once aboard the @entity10 carrier 's @entity8 , he was led to his first - class suite , where a spacious leather seat and ottoman ran the length of four airplane windows and various compartments overflowed with noise - canceling headphones , menus , pajamas and slippers			1
after a dinner of caviar , prawn confit , duck breast and an assortment of @entity28 cheeses , a flight attendant converted @entity30 's seat into a mattress - topped flatbed — complete with duvet and giant pillows — and showed him how to seal his seat from view with a privacy screen for the rest of the 12 - hour flight			2
there 's no doubt about it , first class makes travel better			2
as airlines stave off bankruptcy by cutting amenities and services to their economy classes , there seems to be a shield around the almighty first class			1
according to the @entity54 , this is because upper - class passengers , although a small minority among international air travelers , account for almost a third of airline revenues			1

@entity71 : @entity73 's most scenic walks " in order to stay competitive , airlines need to keep pace with the rapidly changing demands of corporate travelers , " says @entity74 , @entity75 ' vice president of commercial operations			2

@entity97 ' new first class , launched in 2009 , offers a spacious executive desk for one that converts to a comfortable dining table for two ( for those who want dinner company ) ; @entity7 added cabin humidifiers , and trumped the seat - to - flatbed race by adding both a flatbed and a chair to each first - class suite on their 747s			1
of course , no matter how opulent the cabins get , the best part of first - class flying may be off the plane			1
says @entity30 , whose personal @entity7 escort expedited his passage through airport security and passport control , " as much as the free - flowing caviar and throne - like seat add to the exclusivity of first class , it 's the level of on - the - ground attention that makes all the difference			2
" @entity126 they might sound like the dimensions of a @entity129 , but 78 - 23 - 35 are the specs for the first - class suites exclusively offered on @entity126 ' @entity132			1

just when most carriers were adding über - private pods in first , @entity97 bucked the trend and created a superior seat with adjustable partitions and room to dine for two			2
the cabin also features handsome wood paneling and seats whose unique air - cushion technology has won best seat design awards from @entity181 magazine for the past two years			0
when dinner is over , adjust the wall partition to allow for privacy			0

@entity254 @entity7 @entity7 recently trumped the industry 's seat - to - flatbed race by halving the number of first - class suites aboard its 747s and giving each a seat and a bed			1
