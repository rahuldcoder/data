" @entity0 is a @entity1 city			1
" the chant rang out in the eastern @entity4 city on saturday , as thousands of @entity6 demonstrators rallied beneath a towering statue of @entity9 revolutionary @entity8 in the city 's main square			1
they waved @entity1 flags and red flags emblazoned with the iconic image of @entity18 marxist @entity16			2
there was not a single @entity4 flag to be seen			1
" they are frightened , " said local journalist @entity21 of @entity23 protestors			1
" they will not come out and demonstrate			0
" that 's because just three days earlier , @entity27 was the scene of violent clashes that left a 22 - year - old , @entity31 activist dead			1
a floral tribute is the only evidence that remains of the bloodshed that unfolded thursday night when a police cordon that stood between rival groups was breached			2
the tribute appeared a lonely site on saturday as thousands of @entity6 protesters stood with their backs to it			2
their focus turned to a platform beneath the @entity8 statue , where men and women took turns making their case for a referendum on the right to self - determination			0
among the demonstrators was @entity53 , a local leader for the @entity54 in @entity4			1
he told us that people in this eastern pocket of @entity4 supported the idea of federalism			1
" we need more independence from @entity61 for our region			0
most people here do n't think that power in @entity61 is legitimate			0
" in the region , 48 % are ethnic @entity1 and 46 % are ethnic @entity4			1
most speak @entity1 as their first language and feel closer historic ties to @entity70 than @entity61			0
" i am a citizen of @entity4 , " said @entity53			1
" i have the opportunity to leave @entity4 and go to @entity1 to my friends and relations but i do n't want to go			2
i will not leave here because this is my home			0
this is my parents ' native land			0
" while those who support the new government in @entity61 have only been holding sporadic rallies in @entity0 , @entity80 demonstrators have a more permanent presence in @entity27			1
they have set up red tents from where they call for volunteers to join self - defense units and invite people to sign a petition and answer three questions			0
people queue to have their say beneath the @entity1 flags			0
do you support a @entity95 ? yes			0
this is a trade agreement between @entity1 and some of the former @entity9 republics			0
do you want @entity1 to be an official language ? yes			0
should @entity4 be a member of @entity100 ? no. the local council had tried to ban any further demonstrations this weekend following the bloodshed on thursday , but the @entity104 rejected the request , saying there was no evidence of any danger to the public			1
indeed , the rally in @entity27 was peaceful on saturday , though the demonstrators did bring traffic to a standstill when they decided to march through the streets and take their protest to the offices of the @entity117 , the @entity118 , which is loyal to @entity61			1
as riot police stood guard at the building entrance , the demonstrators called for the release of @entity124 , one of the leaders of the @entity127 protest movement who was arrested by the @entity117 on march 6 , for leading a blockade at the regional administration building			2
there were reports of some property damage , but the demonstration did not escalate further			0
but it wo n't be an end to the @entity80 fervor in @entity0			1
police were poised for more of the same with another major rally planned on sunday in a show of support for the referendum in @entity142			0
many in @entity0 want the same .			2
