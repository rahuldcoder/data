@entity0 -- @entity4 president @entity3 's appearances in @entity0 this week are part of a shrewd strategy that is aimed at enhancing his standing in @entity4 and the @entity8 , says analyst @entity9			1
@entity3 , who came to the @entity10 for the annual meeting of the @entity12 , met with journalists and was interviewed on @entity14 , where he called @entity16 prime minister @entity15 a " skilled killer " and parried questions about his nation 's nuclear program			1
" the reality about @entity4 is that it 's a middle - rank power , a regional power , and if not for @entity3 's outlandishness , it would not deserve as much attention as we 're giving it , " @entity9 said			1
" but we give it and him enormous attention and almost give @entity4 and @entity3 free power			1
" the author and host of @entity1 's " @entity32 " spoke to @entity1 on wednesday			0
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : what do you make of @entity3 's appearances in @entity0 this week ? @entity9 : one of the annual traditions of the @entity10 week has become breakfast with @entity3			1
he throws a breakfast for 10 or 12 of us in the media , and its always interesting to see			0
he has certainly become more schooled and practiced at it			0
he 's now very comfortable in the limelight , he 's very comfortable with the media attention			1
i was struck by the fact that while he 's clearly having some troubles at home , he showed no weakness , no hesitation , no nervousness , in fact quite the contrary , he was very confident and quite tough in a lot of the things he said			2
@entity1 : what is his game plan ? @entity9 : at one level he enjoys the limelight and getting all this attention			1
he also recognizes that it gives him a certain kind of status at home			0
there 's that perverse dynamic at play here where the media understands this and yet ends up building up this person			2
but beyond that he 's often pursuing a very shrewd definition of of @entity4 's national interest			1
@entity1 : what makes it shrewd ? @entity9 : for example , the issue that gets the most attention is almost always the comments he makes on the @entity83 issue			1
his goal clearly seems to be to appropriate that issue from the moderate @entity86 states -- @entity87 and @entity88 -- who are of course his key rivals for leadership of the @entity8			2
he goes much further than they can in his zealous defense of the @entity83 cause , in attacks on @entity16 and yet is almost always just short of saying something that is truly belligerent			0
he may have said a few things in the early years that could be interpreted as threatening to attack @entity16 , but now he 's very careful			0
it makes it impossible for the @entity87 president , say , to make an @entity102 speech or an @entity104 speech because on the streets of @entity87 , people regard @entity3 as a friend of the great @entity86 cause			1
@entity1 : is it in his interest to try to doom the peace talks between the @entity16 and the @entity83 ? @entity9 : i asked him why he was opposed to the peace talks if the @entity83 wanted to get into them and would he support any deal that the @entity83 people approved of ? and he was uncomfortable , because on the one hand he has often said that he wants the @entity83 people to get what they want and here of course , he 's criticized the peace talks			1
the honest answer is no , he does not want the peace talks to succeed , and he 's trying to find a way to be an obstructionist without seeming to be an obstructionist			0
he redirects the question into an attack on either @entity16 or an attack on the @entity123 , arguing that we ca n't be a fair broker of these talks because we are too one - sided			0
it helps him to have tension between @entity16 and the @entity83			0
@entity1 : what 's behind the remarks he made about @entity15 ? @entity9 : he made some very inflammatory remarks about @entity15 , he called him a dictator , which is truly bizarre because he 's a duly elected prime minister			1
and then he called him a killer who should be on trial for the death of @entity83 , and that i have n't heard him say before			0
he 's looking for ways where he can be tougher on @entity16 and more zealous in defense of the @entity83 than anyone else in the @entity8			1
@entity1 : did he make any news on the nuclear issue ? @entity9 : again i was struck by how tough he was			1
he did say he would always be willing to talk , but when asked if he was willing to be more cooperative or provide more documents , he was very resistant			0
it was almost as if he had got his back up on that and felt as though @entity4 had made enough concessions already			1
@entity1 : there have been reports that the clerical hierarchy in @entity4 has strong doubts , or fears , about @entity3 ? @entity9 : he now knows how to parry that kind of question pretty well			1
he did n't back down from a few things he had said that have gotten him into trouble in @entity4			2
one of them was that he had praised @entity162 , the @entity163 @entity4 monarch , and he had been criticized by some of the conservative clergy who said you should not be highlighting @entity4 's @entity163 past , you should be highlighting @entity4 's @entity169 heritage			1
and he in effect doubled down on his praise			0
he said he was a great king , he abolished serfdom , he abolished slavery , i do n't see what 's wrong with praising him			0
he said , there are people who disagree with me in @entity4 , but i am the elected president			1
it did n't seem as though he was trying to backtrack			0
he was more comfortable than in the past in admitting that there was opposition in @entity4 , but at the same time holding to his position pretty strongly			2
@entity1 : does @entity3 's tough stance present a dilemma for the @entity186 administration ? @entity9 : sure , it presents a real dilemma			1
basically the @entity186 administration 's @entity4 policy was premised on the idea that we would reach out to the @entity4 and say let us agree to disagree on the fundamental issues of your legitimacy and our legitimacy and just come up with a workable deal that will give you some benefits and us some benefits			2
that strategy was premised on the idea that the @entity4 would be willing to talk , to engage			2
it does n't appear as if they are , or if they are , we have n't found the magic key to unlocking the gate			0
the reality is that the @entity4 regime has as its core a kind of anti-americanism , and maybe that 's the dna and it 's just very difficult for them to move out of it			2
it also may be that at this moment , they face certain internal forces that make it difficult for them to change that basic dynamic and start negotiating with the @entity123			0
@entity1 : so what 's the result ? @entity9 : for whatever reason , they are not willing to play ball , so the @entity186 administration is left to figure out , in the absence of @entity4 cooperation , what 's the best strategy			1
so they 've pushed sanctions , and actually been very successful at getting the sanctions passed by the @entity10 , implemented by the @entity235 , supported by the @entity236 and the @entity237 , but it remains to be seen whether in the short - term it will produce the ultimate goal , which is to make the @entity4 cut some kind of a deal on the nuclear issue			2
@entity1 : do you think the @entity123 has to make a decision imminently or does it have more time ? @entity9 : i think it has time			0
i think the biggest mistake we could make is to inflate the importance of @entity3 , to inflate the importance of @entity4 , inflate the importance of this issue			1
it is a regional power on a path which might end up with its acquisition of nuclear weapons			0
this is not an imminent threat to the @entity123 certainly , and i do n't believe it 's an imminent threat to @entity16			0
the reality is that @entity16 has a very strong nuclear deterrent , probably 200 to 250 nuclear weapons			0
the @entity4 are not crazy			0
seeing @entity3 once more made me feel that these are very savvy calculating characters , and time is not really on their side			2
sanctions are having an effect , the economy is in a mess , the regime faces internal problems , so why should we feel any pressure ? let them feel the pressure .			0
