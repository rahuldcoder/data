income inequality is like the weather : everyone talks about it , but no one does much about it			0
now comes president @entity7 in his @entity8 , hoping to do more than just talk about it			1
the president tackles this perennial conundrum by proposing that the tax code be changed in two very distinct directions : 1 ) provide extra money to low - and middle - income families in the form of tax credits for children and working couples			1
2 ) raise taxes on upper - income taxpayers , especially the fabled " one percent " through various cutbacks and increased restrictions on savings			0
it is certainly easy to dismiss his suggestions given the makeup of the new @entity29 , which is controlled by @entity30 , but stranger concoctions have been enacted when major tax overhauls are undertaken			1
so what does the president suggest ? first , he wants to triple child care tax credits for children under age 5 , thereby supercharging an existing provision that @entity30 and conservatives have generally championed to make the tax system more " family - friendly			1
" second , he proposes a $ 500 tax credit for married couples when both spouses are employed , an idea that essentially replicates a provision that was enacted during president @entity47 's first year			1
the majority party in @entity29 may not be particularly enthralled with president @entity7 's caveat that this credit phase out when a family 's annual income reaches $ 120,000 , but such parameters can be negotiated as legislation gets developed			1
the tax changes on upper - income taxpayers are more likely to generate partisan resistance			2
as a general matter , @entity30 want to lower or even eliminate taxes on capital gains , and this position has been party dogma since the first @entity65 administration			0
in contrast , president @entity7 proposes to raise taxes on capital gains received by married couples with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 per year			2
that income level may be above most people 's conception of " middle class , " but it is far below what it takes to be a " one - percenter			2
" nevertheless , if one wants to address anomalies like @entity78 and @entity79 paying lower effective tax rates than their employees , then raising tax rates on capital gains is a necessity			0
but president @entity7 goes much further and attacks the so - called " step - up in basis " rule -- which the @entity88 calls the " trust fund loophole " -- that allows gains on inherited property to go untaxed , regardless of amount			1
targeting this longstanding tax rule takes aim not at those who have worked hard to create businesses and build wealth , but at those whose pathway to riches was having the right relatives			0
@entity7 's proposal , in other words , seeks to reduce wealth disparities without disincentivizing the job creators among us			1
along these lines , he also proposes that no tax be due on inherited family - operated businesses until they are sold			2
that said , this proposal is no slam dunk			0
as recent battles over the estate tax have demonstrated , @entity115 do not particularly like the federal government claiming to level the proverbial playing field by confiscating family wealth			0
surveys repeatedly show that resentment of the rich is simply not as strong as some politicians seem to believe			0
in any case , the " step - up in basis " rule was effectively repealed in 1976 , but @entity29 then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively			2
nearly two decades later , an effort very similar to president @entity7 's proposal was put forth during president @entity131 's first few months in office , but the response then was also swift and negative			1
will this time be different ? perhaps the sense among some citizens that the system is " rigged " will produce a different result this year , but income inequality is fundamentally not a problem that is exclusively or even primarily about taxation			0
causes range from globalization and unfair trade agreements to falling educational achievement and the decline of private sector labor unions , among others			0
tweaking the tax code , even in the substantial and perhaps radical ways that president @entity7 is due to propose on tuesday , can go only so far in addressing this issue			1
on the other hand , the @entity115 tax code is one part of the puzzle that the federal government can control and do something about in fairly short order			0
tackling tax reform more broadly could be a pathway to bipartisan cooperation that creates a genuine achievement for both president @entity7 and the new @entity29			1
in that context , repealing the " step - up in basis " rule and perhaps equalizing tax rates on capital gains and regular income would go a long way to simplifying tax planning and return preparation while allowing the market to allocate capital without the often nonsensical preferences embedded in the current tax code			2
that is certainly a worthy project			0
but it is a very different focus than trying to ameliorate income inequality			0
regarding the latter , even if president @entity7 's tax proposals are enacted exactly as he set out , they may not do much about income inequality in the @entity115 , but they at least do more than just talk about it .			1

@entity186 says tax *law* changes can reduce inequality to a degree
he says @entity7 's effort to end " trust - fund loophole " is a tough sell
tax reform could be path to bipartisan cooperation , genuine achievement for president and @entity29
