-- celebrity mugshots are hilarious , are n't they ? the disheveled hair , the smeared makeup , the ridiculous attempt by some to still try to look " hot " despite the circumstances			2
the most iconic post-arrest shot is @entity7 circa 2002			2
he looks as if he went through a carwash riding on the hood			2
the mugshot even has its own @entity12 handle			0
yeah , it 's all fun and games until you read why these celebrities were arrested in the first place			1
@entity7 was brought in for suspicion of driving under the influence			1
@entity19 was arrested in 2003 , accused of the same thing			0
as was @entity21 in 2006 and @entity22 in 2007			0
@entity24 point guard @entity23 is lucky to be alive			0
he was arrested in 2012 after running into a utility pole			0
@entity26 , the bassist for the band @entity26 , is also fortunate to be alive			0
in april , he was charged with vehicular homicide when the car he was driving clipped a pickup and crashed into a retaining wall			2
unfortunately , the truck he hit swerved out of control , hit a guardrail , dropped down an embankment and overturned , killing the driver			0
when that happens , the mugshots of celebrity drunken drivers become less funny			0
this week , the @entity40 recommended all 50 states decrease the blood alcohol content threshold for drunken driving from 0.08 % to 0.05 %			1
the goal is to have zero deaths from alcohol - related car accidents			1
noble but unattainable if our attitude about drinking and driving does n't change			1
in 2010 , adults self - reported drinking and driving about 112 million times			1
only 1.4 million drivers -- about 1 % -- were arrested			0
in other words , if someone has had one too many drinks and gets behind the wheel of a car 100 times in a year , they might get caught once			0
how do you convince a nation that gets away with a crime 99 % of the time that it 's a serious matter ? we can talk about the deaths , but let 's be honest -- more than 10,000 people dying each year because of alcohol - impaired crashes is sad			1
but more teens die from texting and driving than drinking and driving			1
so , should n't we put more energy into that instead ? to really move the needle on any issue of importance , it helps to make it a personal matter as it is a legal one			0
the @entity82 estimates that 85 % of self - reported drunken drivers were binge drinkers			2
for men , that constitutes at least five drinks in an hour			0
five drinks raises your level to .10 %			0
so instead of using resources to lobby for a new federal law that lowers the threshold , the @entity40 should direct its influence on helping states enforce the current one			1
if more people were caught , the less other people would feel that they could get away with it			0
lowering the blood alcohol threshold does nothing if we do n't increase the number of checkpoints so people can be arrested for breaking the current law			1
and you could fund this increase in checkpoints by doing something the @entity110 recommends : imposing a tax on alcoholic beverages			0
for a 180 - pound man , as little as two beers could cause his blood alcohol content to reach 0.05			1
how many elected officials are really going to want to fight food and beverage lobbyists in addition to bar and restaurant owners for that ? a slight increase in price to fund an initiative to arrest drunken drivers will not only discourage binge drinking ( because it 's more expensive to do so ) , but it is a message that 's easier to sell to a nation that consumed 6.3 billion gallons of beer in 2011			1
maybe then instead of dismissing the @entity131 and @entity132 of the world as being stupid enough to get caught , the public would view celebrities who are arrested for drunken driving as reminders that they could be caught , too			2
because at the end of the day , the @entity40 can try to pass all the laws it wants , but if people do n't get caught , then the law is toothless			1
that 's part of the reason why celebrity mugshots are so funny because those fools got caught			2
but drunken driving would be less funny to everyone if more people were greeted at a checkpoint with a breathalyzer			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			1

@entity40 wants to reduce blood alcohol *benchmark*
@entity153 : @entity40 's goal is to reduce alcohol - related deaths , but this is hard to attain
he says more teens die from texting and driving than drinking and driving
@entity164 : instead of lowering the threshold , enforce current laws better
