an expanded @entity0 won bipartisan approval on thursday from the @entity2 after @entity3 failed to pass their own proposal due to a party split on an issue important to women and minority groups			1
the measure now goes to president @entity10 , who said in a statement that it was " an important step towards making sure no one in @entity14 is forced to live in fear			1
" " i look forward to signing it into law as soon as it hits my desk , " @entity10 said			2
@entity21 photos : a portrait of domestic violence thursday 's votes reflected an emerging political reality in the @entity26 - led @entity2 , with a minority of republicans joining @entity29 to pass legislation that has broad public support , including from increasingly influential demographics such as @entity33			1
by a vote of 166 - 257 , the @entity26 version of the @entity0 failed to win a majority after almost 90 minutes of debate			2
the @entity2 then voted 286 - 138 to pass the @entity39 version , with 87 republicans joining all 199 @entity29 to provide majority support			1
originally passed in 1994 and reauthorized since , the act provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims			0
criminal prosecutions of abusers are generally the responsibility of local authorities , but the act stiffened sentences for stalking under federal law			2
supporters credit the act with sharply reducing the number of lives lost to domestic violence over the past two decades			1
last year , the @entity2 and @entity39 were unable to compromise on another extension of the act , with republicans opposing @entity29 attempts to specify inclusion of native americans , undocumented immigrants and lesbian , transgender and bisexual women			1
opinion : the plague of violence against women however , exit polls showed @entity10 won strong support among women , @entity33 voters and gay and lesbian voters in the november election that also strengthened the @entity29 majority in the @entity39 and weakened the @entity26 majority in the @entity2			1
republicans then changed their stance and agreed to bring up the measure in the new @entity83 as long as they could offer their own version			2
the @entity26 proposal deleted provisions from the @entity39 measure that gave tribal authorities jurisdiction to prosecute cases on @entity91 reservations , specifically targeted discrimination of @entity94 victims , and allowed undocumented immigrant survivors of domestic violence to seek legal status			1
in debate before thursday 's votes , rep. @entity98 , @entity99 , said the @entity39 version includes legal precedents of expanded sovereignty that could be subject to court challenge			1
opinion : @entity107 missed the year of the woman " please consider the damage we have done if a court overturns this act and its protection all because we wanted a good slogan instead of a good law , " @entity98 said			2
@entity117 @entity116 of @entity118 and others repeatedly questioned why @entity3 would seek to weaken a measure that received strong bipartisan support in a 78 - 22 @entity39 vote earlier this year			1
a majority of @entity3 backed the act , along with every woman senator regardless of party , @entity116 noted			2
" it 's really hard to explain why , what eyes the @entity60 are looking through , that they do not see the folly of their ways in the legislation they are proposing , " @entity116 said			0
@entity29 rep. @entity133 of @entity134 , herself a rape victim , paraphrased the question of rights activist @entity138 , a 19th century escaped slave and civil rights advocate			0
" @entity141 n't they women ? " @entity133 shouted in reference to native @entity14 , undocumented immigrant and @entity94 women			0
in response , @entity147 rep. @entity147 of @entity148 challenged @entity29 claims that the @entity26 version excluded any women , saying it was all - inclusive			1
a global push to end violence with song and dance @entity2 majority leader @entity158 of @entity159 said the goal was to " make sure all women are safe , " and he described the @entity26 version as an attempt to " improve on " what the @entity39 sent over			1
however , @entity116 noted that hundreds of advocacy groups supported the @entity39 version as the best way forward			1
" this is a remarkable day because we have clarity between the two proposals , " she said , noting one had support from both parties in the @entity39 and the president while the other was opposed by " almost everybody who has anything to do with the issue of violence against women			1
" the final vote on thursday followed the same pattern as votes on other legislation at the end of the previous @entity83 , including the agreement to avoid some impacts of the fiscal cliff			0
a divide between conservative and more moderate @entity3 prevented @entity2 @entity26 leaders from being able to pass their proposed fiscal cliff legislation at the end of the year			1
under public pressure ratcheted up by @entity10 , the @entity2 ended up approving a @entity29 proposal that raised taxes on the nation 's top income earners , a key campaign theme in the november election opposed by the @entity26			1
the measure passed with backing from most or all @entity29 and dozens of @entity3			2
such a dynamic signals the continuing inability of house speaker @entity203 to marshal his @entity26 members on some of the most contentious issues coming up , such as deficit reduction and immigration reform			2
@entity203 risks his standing as a party leader if he continues conceding on measures that become law without majority support from @entity60 , which also would fuel continuing unrest by conservatives who traditionally comprise the @entity26 base			2
domestic violence bill vote critical test of more inclusive @entity26 according to advocacy groups , the @entity39 version of the @entity0 approved tuesday strengthens protections of particular groups of women at particular risk			1
for example , one in three native women will be raped in their lifetime , according to the @entity227			0
three in five will be physically assaulted , and native women also are killed at a rate 10 times the national average , the center said			0
the @entity83 addressed the issue in a december 20 letter to @entity158			0
beyond vomiting , how to prevent rape it described situations in which beatings and rapes by non-native men were declined for prosecution at a federal level and returned to a tribal court as a misdemeanor			0
federal law currently prohibits tribal courts from imposing a jail sentence of more than a year , so they generally do not prosecute felonies			0
in many instances , such cases are dismissed altogether and a defendant can walk free until a grand jury indictment can be obtained			0
" the federal criminal justice system is simply not equipped to handle local crimes , and this is the primary reason that tribes seek local control over these crimes that are plaguing our communities , " the letter said			0
on undocumented immigrants , @entity263 has found that immigrant farm workers are especially at risk for domestic abuse and argued provisions in the @entity39 bill " would go some way toward fixing the problem			0
" those in the @entity94 community are another high - risk group that will be affected by the @entity0			0
they experience violence at the same rate as heterosexuals but are less likely to report it			0
when they do , many are denied services			0
about 45 % of @entity94 victims were turned away when they sought help from a domestic violence shelter and nearly 55 % of those who sought protection orders were denied them , according to the @entity286 to end sexual and @entity287			0
opinion : @entity26 @entity2 's inaction on @entity0 shows bigotry vice president @entity291 , who helped spearhead the original @entity0 in 1994 when he was a @entity14 senator , said thursday that domestic violence dropped by 64 % since then			1
" i am pleased that this progress will continue , with new tools for cops and prosecutors to hold abusers and rapists accountable , and more support for all victims of these crimes , " @entity291 said in a statement .			0

the measure now goes to president @entity10 to be signed into law
@entity2 @entity3 *struggle* again with an issue important to women , minorities
the @entity2 rejects the @entity26 measure before approving the @entity39 version
the legislation extends and expands the act that supporters credit with *saving* lives
