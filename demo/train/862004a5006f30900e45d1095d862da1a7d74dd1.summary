@entity1 's fan is n't allowed on stage under the rules of an october 21 @entity6 governor 's race debate that @entity7 is hosting in conjunction with @entity10 affiliate @entity9			1
the candidates were sent a memo on october 8 outlining the format , rules and logistical information for the debate			0
among those rules : no electronic devices			2
the memo stated : " there will be no opening and closing statements , no notes , no props and no electronic devices will be allowed on stage			2
candidates will be provided water , notepad and pen , " a @entity7 spokesperson said thursday			0
the @entity7 spokesperson said electronic devices range from a cell phone to a fan			1
@entity1 's decision to place a fan on stage during a separate debate wednesday night triggered what the moderator described as " the most unique beginning to any debate not only in @entity6 , but anywhere in the country			1
" related : fan delays @entity6 debate @entity6 's @entity48 governor , @entity47 , was seven minutes late walking onto the stage -- while moderators tried to explain during the live broadcast that he had decided not to participate because @entity1 had placed a small electronic fan under his own podium to keep cool			1
almost immediately , " @entity55 " was trending on @entity54			0
@entity1 , standing alone on stage , asked if the candidates were " really going to debate about a fan			2
" eventually , @entity47 walked onto the stage			0
his campaign said later that it was actually @entity1 who was in the midst of intense behind - the - scenes conversations with debate organizers over whether his fan would be allowed -- and that @entity47 was just waiting to see what happened			2
he had n't realized that @entity1 had gone on stage			0
@entity47 said on @entity7 's " @entity69 " with @entity70 on thursday that he had been waiting in a trailer for debate officials to tell him to head to the stage			1
" they said he was n't going to show up , that he was balking about his fan , " @entity47 said , adding that he did n't care if @entity1 had a fan , a microwave or a humidifier			0
the organizers of the october 15 debate backed up @entity47 's version of events thursday , saying @entity1 clearly broke the rules -- and ignored instructions given an hour before start time -- by having an aide place the fan on stage			1
each campaign was sent a letter ahead of time explaining that " candidates may not bring electronic devices ( including fans ) , visual aids or notes to the debate , " the two groups that hosted the debate wednesday , leadership @entity6 and the @entity6 @entity93 , said thursday			1
@entity1 's campaign signed and returned that letter two days before the debate with a handwritten note appended saying the @entity107 agreed to those rules , " with understanding that the debate hosts will address any temperature issues with a fan if necessary			1
" @entity113 , the president of the @entity6 @entity93 , got the note and told @entity1 's campaign that while organizers wanted all candidates to be comfortable , the auditorium at @entity123 , where the debate was to be held , " would be maintained at a comfortable temperature , and if there was a temperature problem , the partners would deal with it appropriately			1
" the stage was at 67 degrees at 6 p.m. thursday , an hour before the debate			0
at 6:20 p.m. , it was 66 degrees			0
but at some point in that 20 - minute span , a @entity1 campaign aide placed the fan on stage -- " and they were again told that no fans would be permitted , " organizers said			0
" in the minutes before airtime , the communication among the campaigns , the producing television station and the debate partners was chaotic and there undoubtedly was some confusion , but gov. @entity47 never told @entity144 or @entity145 , president , leadership @entity6 , that he would not join the debate , " the organizers said			1
" rather , the @entity47 campaign was waiting on resolution of the rules issue before @entity47 took the stage			0
the debate partners appreciate gov. @entity47 's willingness to participate in the debate			2

rules of an october 21 @entity7 / @entity9 debate *prohibit* electronic devices , including fans .
@entity6 's @entity1 's use of a fan during a wednesday debate triggered a *bizarre* *episode* .
@entity1 's *opponent* , gov. @entity47 , was several minutes walking onto the stage .
