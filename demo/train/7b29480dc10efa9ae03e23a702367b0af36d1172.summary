-- @entity2 energy chief @entity1 knows first - hand what access to electricity can bring to the developing world			1
growing up in the @entity8 country of @entity9 , he would often study by candlelight as frequent blackouts would leave his university dormitory without power supply			2
today , as director general of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , @entity1 is using his experiences to ensure no one in the world is left in the dark			1
an outspoken advocate of energy access , @entity1 is working to prove that there are smarter power strategies that can benefit all nations			1
" i advocate that let 's have poor people get energy -- 1.3 billion of them who have no electricity at all , " he says			1
" if we 're going to lift eight billion people by 2025 or 2030 , you need energy access			1
" the passionate and influential energy leader was appointed director general of @entity15 in 2005			1
now , in his second and final term , @entity1 is aggressively promoting the " @entity37 " program -- a @entity2 initiative bringing together governments , businesses and civil society groups to transform global energy systems by 2030			1
read related : harnessing pedal power to light up @entity44 @entity1 , a former minister for trade , industry and state enterprises in @entity9 , travels the world encouraging world leaders and other highly influential people to join in what he believes will help fight poverty and strengthen nations			1
he wants to find and install cleaner , renewable alternatives that enhance energy production and are friendlier to the environment			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity0 about the @entity2 's energy strategy , plus his personal story and his work for @entity44			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : one of your big topics has been energy access to end energy poverty			1
@entity1 : we are convinced that without access to energy you can not achieve the @entity69			1
i know from my experience growing up in @entity9 , going back there today , that if you do n't have access to energy you ca n't talk about closing the digital divide ... you can not talk about getting manufacturing done			1
the secretary general calls energy the golden thread that runs through all the development pillars			1
in fact , 60 to 70 % of the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change come from energy systems			1
so if you want to fix climate change , you need an energy revolution			2
@entity0 : do you think it 's possible to eliminate energy poverty around the world by 2030 ? @entity88 : we believe it 's doable			1
we have the best minds working on this , our friends from the @entity15 , friends form the @entity95 , the international energy agency			1
we feel very excited because we just got a big boost in @entity97 ... over 50 developing countries stepped forward wanting to be part of this initiative			0
the challenge now : we 've got billions of dollars of pledges -- how do you convert pledges to real action on the ground over the next 10 years			0
can we hold ourselves and countries and businesses accountable that what they pledged they really meant to do ? read : in the dark -- @entity44 's haphazard electricity supply @entity0 : can you explain the connection between ending poverty and energy ? @entity88 : for me that 's our role in the @entity2 , to make that connection to see the possibilities of transformative change that spreads prosperity for all			1
if we do n't do it and we become nine billion and one third of mankind is still poor but yet we 've taken all their raw materials to be prosperous , there will be insecurity around the world			0
@entity0 : what are your frustrations that you have , particularly when it comes to finance ? @entity88 : the frustration is that because sometimes of narrow political interests you see people knowing what to do , believing in what to do but for the sake of short term political gain -- because they have to stand for election in four years -- they decide not to support a cause			0
we call it in global governance short - termism			0
so you are trying to talk to them about transformative change for 10 years and they 're like " ok , yeah , right			0
i have elections coming up next year			0
i need to talk about populist topics now			0
" read : pay - as - you - go solar power lights up rural @entity44 it 's the same with development corporations we see for example in the context of @entity44			0
people talk a lot about poverty reduction but they do n't want to talk about wealth creation in @entity44			2
but you have to create wealth in @entity44 , you have to help those economies move into the industrial age			0
if @entity8 population is going to be 1.3 billion by 2030 , two billion almost by 2050 , most of those people living in the cities you must to talk about wealth creation , you must talk about manufacturing to transform those economies -- otherwise there will be crisis			2
people forget that this so - called @entity184 revolution started in @entity185 , that 's @entity44 -- it was about youths demanding jobs , yes , there was governance issues but at the end of the day it was about jobs and prosperity and lack of vote			2
the rest of @entity196 need that change			0
but people rather talk about poverty alleviation , saving the poor people in @entity44 than talking about a true partnership with @entity44 to transform those economies			2
that 's an old paradigm of development in @entity44 : @entity44 as a receiver as a poor nation , " save their souls			0
" no , it is about partnerships , it 's about making @entity44 a viable entity in a 21st century global economy			0
politicians will talk about poverty because it 's a little bit more sexy			2
@entity0 : what needs to happen in @entity44 ? @entity88 : i always say to people , we @entity221 do n't want to be basket weavers forever , that 's not what my child is looking for			0
she 's in a wonderful university somewhere , she wants to come back to @entity44 and have a good job			0
africans themselves need to think differently today			0
they must believe that they can transform			0
look at what globalization did in the last 20 years , lifting 200 - 300 million people out of poverty in @entity237 and @entity238 alone			2
if poor countries , particularly in @entity44 , depend only on commodities , they will remain poor			0
that is my message , that is my advocacy in the world -- and to do that , you need infrastructure , you need energy , good governance , education , market opportunities and global partnerships .			2
