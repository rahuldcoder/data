" @entity7 " cartoonist @entity6 and " @entity8 " creator @entity5			0
it 's a diverse list of entertainers with a pile of @entity12 , emmys and @entity14 between them , not to mention dozens of big - screen blockbusters and enduring fan favorites			2
but they , and a growing list of others , have something new in common			0
all are part of projects being developed and released by tech companies known more for making products that deliver entertainment than producing the entertainment themselves			1
@entity30 is the most recent tech titan to confirm such plans			1
this week , the computing giant unveiled @entity34 , a dozen original television series , from documentaries to sci - fi epics , that will be available exclusively on its gaming consoles and other @entity30 devices			1
leading the charge are @entity1 and @entity2 , who are involved in two separate series based on the massively popular " @entity44 " video - game franchise			1
others in the lineup , which will begin rolling out in june , include a sci - fi drama , " humans , " and " @entity50 , " a documentary series that " will expose little - known stories of how modern technology has radically altered the way we interact with our world			1
" " @entity30 has a long and rich legacy in the content business , " said @entity56 , executive vice president of @entity57			1
" games have been part of our dna for at least the last 15 years , and creating original tv content is a logical next step in our evolution			1
" the announcement is just the latest in a series of similar moves			2
if , as @entity30 's own @entity71 once said , content is king , an increasing number of digital - age companies no longer satisfied playing middleman are making their claims for the throne			1
@entity78 led the charge two years ago , and has @entity80 to show for it			1
two shows for the digital streaming service , " @entity83 " and " @entity84 , " debuted in 2012			2
but it was " @entity86 , " which brought home two emmys last year , that cemented @entity78 as a serious source of original material			1
newer hits like " @entity91 " and a revived " @entity92 " have shown its success to be no fluke			0
last year , @entity95 began producing original content for its prime streaming service , most notably " @entity99 , " a political comedy created by @entity6 and starring @entity3			1
and on monday , @entity100 announced it will be bringing its own long - form shows to our multitude of screens next year , starting with a pair of comedies			1
sure , we all want to be in show business			0
but what 's behind @entity110 's sudden rush to the studio ? do n't be shocked , but experts say it 's to make more money			0
" the reasons they all want to do it today are the same reasons we predicted @entity78 would do it back in 2010 and 2011 -- because when you have something no one else has , you can charge more money for it , " said @entity115 , a tech analyst with @entity116			1
" whether you charge people for the content itself or whether you charge them for the game console , tablet , or app that it 's a part of , original content is one of the only legal ways to achieve monopoly power and all the benefits that come with it			1
@entity138 knows this , @entity140 knows this , and now @entity30 knows it , too			2
" @entity115 noted that entertainment platforms like @entity78 and @entity144 -- which is launching its own variety show with comedian @entity146 -- often find themselves at odds with content providers over who earns how much of their revenues			1
making themselves over into one - stop - shops whenever possible eliminates that problem , he said			0
and it does n't mean having to build their own sound stages , either			0
" many of the production companies that supply content to the broadcast networks and movie studios would be thrilled to have the chance to develop content for a faster , nimbler , more direct distributor of content , " the prescient analyst wrote in 2012			0
for a company like @entity95 , the benefits could be twofold			0
its original content is available to members who have paid $ 99 for an annual prime membership			2
in theory , someone who joins to watch a show will then be more likely to use free shipping and other benefits as well , thus pumping more cash into @entity95 's coffers			0
of all the current players , @entity30 may be uniquely suited to this new game			2
" if you 're @entity30 , the place you start is with a monopoly you already hold , " @entity115 said			2
" ' @entity44 ' is the best example , and if @entity30 did n't try to turn it into video gold , it would prove that @entity30 is not paying attention			2
" since launching in 2001 , " @entity44 " games have sold more than 50 million copies			0
the military science - fiction game , which focuses on an interstellar conflict between humans and an alliance of alien races bent on their destruction , is now owned by @entity197 and available exclusively for the @entity199 gaming consoles			0
does that make the title a slam dunk , particularly when names like @entity1 and @entity2 are mixed in ? not necessarily , @entity115 said			0
" knowing you have a hot property and turning it into a hit are two very different things , " he said			0
" there is no guarantee that one leads naturally to the other and in fact , many people have failed with even more obvious opportunities in the history of the entertainment business			0
" see @entity219 's ' @entity218 , ' any @entity221 movie , and the last two @entity223 movies if you need further evidence			0

@entity30 announces @entity227 , a slate of original tv series
the move is part of a tech trend toward producing original streaming content
@entity100 also announces two comedy series this week
