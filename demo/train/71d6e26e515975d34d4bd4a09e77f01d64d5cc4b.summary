@entity0 -- a federal appeals court panel is considering whether photos of @entity5 's body should be released			1
@entity6 , a conservative legal group , argued thursday before a three - judge panel that the @entity8 requires the government to release the pictures or better explain why the release of specific images would damage national security			1
the judges , with the @entity14 in @entity0 , did not say how soon they may rule			1
@entity6 attorney @entity16 said government records indicate there are 52 images of @entity5 taken just after his death or when his body was aboard the @entity22 and then buried at sea			1
during the court hearing , @entity16 argued the shots of the burial at sea could be released without fear of harming national security , but he did not make that claim about the more gruesome images taken just after @entity5 was shot at his compound in @entity33 , @entity34			0
the government has said that there are sensitivities concerning the death of @entity5 and that releasing the pictures could lead to violence against @entity41			0
" this was the mastermind of 9/11 , " @entity16 said			0
" this was the most wanted terrorist in the world			0
" the government has said @entity5 's body was cleaned in accordance with @entity50 practices , then wrapped respectfully and buried at sea , he said			1
@entity16 said the government has not said how releasing those images would be harmful			0
the judges took issue with that and said government officials had provided information about previous incidents that led to violence in the @entity62 world or provided terrorists with fuel for propaganda			0
among the examples were the treatment of prisoners at @entity69 in @entity70 and reports that @entity41 had desecrated qurans			0
" why should we not defer to that ? " asked judge @entity72 , who was appointed to the court by president @entity74			1
" we are told there is a risk ... that @entity41 could die if the pictures are released			0
" @entity80 , arguing for the government , noted that @entity83 leader @entity82 made statements that @entity5 's body was not treated in accordance with @entity50 traditions in an effort to " inflame tensions			2
" in a statement released before the hearing , @entity6 president @entity89 said that " president @entity92 is asking the courts to rewrite ( the @entity8 ) to allow his administration to withhold documents simply because their disclosure may cause controversy			1
" debates over releasing the photos of the @entity83 leader have raged in some quarters ever since the may 2011 raid in @entity34 that left him dead			2
the @entity104 said that despite pressure from some lawmakers and dissent within the ranks of the president 's top advisers , @entity92 decided not to release them			1
" it is not in our national security interest ... to allow these images to become icons to rally opinion against the @entity41 , " @entity104 press secretary @entity112 said at the time			0
@entity6 asked the @entity119 to comply with a @entity8 request for material on the raid , including photos of the september 11 instigator lying dead on the third floor of his hideout			1
a federal judge ruled in april 2012 that there were legitimate national security interests to deny disclosure			1
" a picture may be worth a thousand words			0
and perhaps moving pictures bear an even higher value , " judge @entity133 said			2
" yet , in this case , verbal descriptions of the death and burial of @entity5 will have to suffice			0
" at the thursday hearing , @entity16 raised questions about whether the images were properly classified or if that action was taken only in the face of the @entity8 request to release them			1
" there 's no doubt the classification was done beforehand , " @entity80 said			2
@entity6 says its appeal makes clear that the group is not seeking information about equipment or techniques used in the raid			1
the government has " failed to provide any evidence that all 52 images , including those depicting @entity5 's burial at sea , pertain to ' foreign activities of the @entity41 , ' " the appeal argues			2
" defendants also have failed to provide any evidence that images depicting the burial at sea actually pertain to ' intelligence activities			0
' " nor have they demonstrated that the release of images of a somber , dignified burial at sea reasonably could be expected to cause identifiable or describable exceptionally grave damage to national security			2
" @entity1 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0

new : the three - judge panel heard arguments ; it did not say how soon it may rule
conservative legal group @entity6 has pushed for release of the photos
a federal judge *rejected* the group 's request in april 2012
the group says @entity92 is asking the courts to rewrite the @entity8
