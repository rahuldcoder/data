-- the sister of a missing 2 - year - old @entity3 girl saw " a mean guy " kidnap the toddler from the beach , her father says , though police insist they have no evidence of any " mysterious man " or an abduction			1
@entity12 was last seen by her mother and 4 - year - old sister at @entity16 's @entity15 , on the @entity17 of @entity3 , around noon april 19			1
since then , authorities have conducted water , ground and air search for the toddler , to no avail			1
the missing girl 's father , @entity24 , told @entity27 's @entity26 on thursday night that he believes @entity12 was kidnapped			1
he bases his belief on what his 4 - year - old daughter has told him , as well as drawings by the older sister			1
@entity24 said his older daughter was with @entity12 when she went missing while their mother went to retrieve a ball			1
" at first it was the mean guy , " @entity24 said of the 4 - year - old 's description of @entity40 's alleged abductor			2
" and then she got into detail about black shorts , he was smoking a cigarette , he had facial hair			0
" @entity24 first publicly mentioned such a man a day earlier , calling the girl 's description " a little bit scattered " and among a " couple of different stories " he 'd heard from her			2
the children 's mother , @entity52 , also appearing on @entity27 , said the older sister " simply shuts down and says i just do n't want to talk about it , " when she presses her for details			2
" she has not acted the same since that day , " @entity56 said of her 4 - year - old daughter			0
" if you ask her questions about the pictures she 's drawn , she becomes expressionless , she just changes			0
" @entity62 spokesman @entity61 said by e-mail thursday that authorities " have found no evidence to support the abduction theory			1
" " that does not mean that we can say with 100 % certainty that foul play did not occur , only that we have found no evidence of it -- including no evidence of a mysterious man on the beach , " @entity61 said			1
that day , @entity56 said she 'd taken her daughter and her parents ' dog to the beach , about 40 miles northeast of @entity80 , where they played in the water and went for a walk			1
at one point , @entity56 said she threw a tennis ball for the dog " terribly " and it went over a wall near some cottages			0
she then " got the kids situated ... playing in the sand and by the rocks , " as she walked over to some stairs to get the ball , @entity56 said			0
" i could see them the whole way when i was walking over to the stairway ... and they were fine , " she said of her daughters			0
" and one of the times i looked back , @entity12 was just gone			1
" @entity56 said she went down to find her 4 - year - old daughter with her " arms outstretched and she said , ' @entity12 's gone			1
' she did n't say anything more than that			0
" afterward , the mother said she began looking intently for the toddler , who " was wearing bright pink that day			2
" she found no sign of her			2
nor did authorities looking through " ocean and tidal areas for several days with divers , sonar , dogs , boots on the ground and helicopters , " said @entity61			2
the state police spokesman added that investigators also spoke to a female surfer , two women walking on a sidewalk above the beach , a man playing basketball and others			1
" none of them saw anyone or anything suspicious in the vicinity of the family , " @entity61 said			0
" likewise , no one saw her actually fall into the water			0
" a " forensic interviewer who specializes in speaking to children ( involved in ) traumatic incidents " talked with @entity12 's sister , the police spokesman said , though he would n't offer details			1
@entity24 said that he did n't have an explanation why it took two weeks for him to discuss what his daughter told him about the alleged abductor			0
regardless , he said he 's convinced her story is true			0
" i would n't put my daughter under this kind of scrutiny ( if i did n't believe it ) , " @entity24 said			0
" this came from the heart			0
" @entity27 's @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
