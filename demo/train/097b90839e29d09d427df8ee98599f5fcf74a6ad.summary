@entity0 -- as snow fell across @entity4 , @entity2 clutched her mother , @entity5 , aboard a passenger ship that puttered toward @entity7 and wondered what their new lives would bring			1
about a week earlier , the 10 - year - old girl from what is now called @entity13 , @entity14 , had embarked on a transatlantic journey with her @entity17 parents from the @entity19 port city of @entity20 , escaping what she described as @entity23 persecution at the start of @entity26 's @entity25			1
on an island near @entity28 stood the copper colossus that would etch her first memories of the new world			1
" it was a wonderful sight , " she said of the @entity33 , which marked its 125th anniversary friday			1
the idea for the monument is thought to have been conceived at a 19th - century dinner party among @entity19 aristocrats , historians say , who sought to pay tribute to @entity44 liberty			1
and while the @entity19 gift is also widely believed to have at least in part catered to domestic politics , for many , it quickly became a symbol of hope and promise in @entity44 's post- @entity53 period			1
" the arrival on @entity7 is the fulfillment that you know something good is going to happen to you , " said @entity54 , now a 91 - year - old widow living in a @entity14 enclave of @entity56 , @entity0			1
her family became part of the more than 12 million immigrants processed through @entity7 between 1892 and 1954 , according to the @entity44 @entity65			1
adjacent to @entity7 towers @entity33 , measuring more than 305 feet from base to torch			1
originally , the statue was supposed to be an @entity71 peasant girl that would have stood at the entrance of @entity71 's then - new @entity74 , but plans would evolve into the @entity77 goddess who would instead adorn @entity4			1
" the sculptor , ( @entity84 ) @entity83 , was very clever , " said @entity78 , professor of history and director of the @entity81 at @entity82			2
" he put ( the statue ) where he did because it 's right at the narrows of @entity4 , so he knew that every boat that came into @entity0 would have to come really close to it			2
people felt like they could reach out and touch it , " he said			2
inspired perhaps by @entity71 's colossal statues during his own travels to @entity94 , @entity78 noted , @entity83 sought to build a monument of his own in a tribute to @entity44 liberty and its newfound emancipation of the slaves			2
the statue rests atop a sculpted wrangling of broken chains on @entity0 's @entity104			2
only years later , @entity78 argues , did the monument come to symbolize immigration to the broader public , despite the structure 's engraved plaque bearing the now - famous poem by @entity111 , asking for the " huddled masses yearning to breathe free			2
" like many who made the perilous journey , @entity2 said , she had often wondered what kind of life was waiting for her on the shores behind the monument			2
" it was quite frightening , " she recalled			0
" the three of us , my father , my mother and i , wanted for someone to come with money or to tell us what 's next			0
" and though a @entity44 law passed six years earlier had largely restricted immigration , her father , @entity125 , had managed to secure three tickets to @entity44 by way of a talent scout who visited the @entity131 where he had performed as an opera singer			0
" he had such a beautiful voice , " she said			0
their travel permit , however , was only temporary			0
@entity136 had acquired a six - month visa to teach at @entity138 , @entity2 said			0
the young family would nonetheless settle more permanently in a west @entity28 apartment			0
and unlike many who eventually returned to their homelands in @entity144 , the @entity141 decided to leave @entity13 -- then known as @entity13 -- behind			0
" authorities were starting to clamp down and consolidate the social state and @entity25 power around @entity26 , " said @entity145 , a @entity14 expert at the @entity147 - based @entity146			1
" as an opera singer , you might not have wanted to start singing @entity25 anthems			0
" so the young family left @entity14 without plans to return , @entity2 added			1
and though many immigrants entered the @entity44 through @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , historians say steamship companies most often cruised into @entity4 , commonly making the @entity33 the first land sighting for new arrivals			1
" everybody spoke of the golden land , " @entity54 said			0
" ' come to @entity44 , where there 's gold on the streets , ' until they came here and they had to live in walk - up tenement houses , " she said , referencing hardships often endured in overcrowded city buildings			0
immigrants also commonly faced unsanitary and unsafe work conditions on docks and in factories as @entity44 's need for industrial labor grew			0
" if you think immigration is unpopular now , " @entity78 said , " if anything , it was even more unpopular in the 1890s and the first part of the 20th century			0
" successive immigrant waves , however , still rushed to @entity44 's shores through @entity7 and past the @entity33 , often buoyed by the prospect of economic opportunity			1
" i think it took a while for people to think of themselves as @entity44 , " @entity78 said			0
" for an awful lot of people , what they wanted was to think of themselves as whatever they were originally and as @entity44 too			0
" anniversary celebrations of the @entity33 were marked friday by a series of official speeches and an array of webcams , provided by @entity207 , that streamed video footage from the torch			1
the statue will close for renovations starting saturday , though @entity104 will remain open , according to the @entity65 .			0
