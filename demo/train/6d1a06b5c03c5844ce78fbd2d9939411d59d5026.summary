@entity0 -- a third man in @entity5 has died from the @entity7 virus , a strain of avian flu not previously detected in humans , the @entity3 provincial department of health said wednesday , according to state - run media outlet @entity11			1
the disclosure of the third death comes only days after @entity5 authorities announced the first three known cases of humans infected with the @entity7 bird flu virus on sunday			1
the total number of people infected with @entity7 in @entity5 has risen to nine , @entity11 reported wednesday			1
the death reported wednesday was that of a 38 - year - old man who passed away on march 27 in his home province of @entity3 in eastern @entity5 , @entity11 reported			1
he worked in nearby @entity25 province , where at least four other cases of humans infected with @entity7 were reported tuesday			1
two other people who died -- men aged 27 and 87 -- lived in nearby @entity29 , according to @entity11			1
the @entity30 confirmed those deaths monday			1
@entity5 authorities are trying to find the source of the human infections			1
they have so far said there are no signs of transmission of the @entity7 virus between any of the victims or people they have come into close contact with , suggesting the virus is n't highly contagious among humans			0
they have also dismissed suggestions linking the infections with the discovery of thousands of pig carcasses from the @entity49 which runs through @entity29			1
the @entity50 on monday tested 34 samples of pig carcasses pulled from the river and found no bird flu viruses , @entity11 reported			0
on tuesday , the @entity25 provincial health bureau reported four cases of @entity7 in humans : a 45 - year - old woman from @entity59 , a 48 - year - old woman from @entity61 , an 83 - year - old man from @entity63 , and a 32 - year - old woman from @entity65			1
the @entity59 woman worked culling poultry , it said			2
@entity69 , a professor at @entity71 's @entity70 , said monday that the @entity7 strain of avian flu , already known to exist in wild birds , had probably been transmitted to poultry , and it infected the humans			0
" it 's really important to understand where this virus is coming from , " he said			0
authorities in @entity29 are gathering daily data on cases of pneumonia resulting from unknown causes and will set up a team of experts to assess the " severity and risk " of @entity7 , @entity11 reported tuesday			2
since the transmission of these types of viruses from animals to humans is usually " extremely inefficient , " there are often tens of thousands of infected birds for every human case , according to @entity69			0
as a result , " it is very likely that there is a quite widespread outbreak happening " among the animals from which it came , he said , underscoring the urgent need to track down the source			2
the @entity30 said monday it was " in contact with the national authorities and is following the event closely			0
" because there are so few cases of @entity7 detected so far , little research has been done , according to @entity11			2
there are no known vaccines against this virus , it said			0
but @entity69 said it was likely that existing anti-flu drugs , such as @entity117 , are likely to work against the @entity7 strain			0
he also noted that the @entity30 has identified the @entity120 virus family as a potential threat and earmarked possible vaccine candidates			0
he said other strains from the @entity120 family had caused previous outbreaks in poultry in countries including the @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , the @entity131 and @entity132			0
human infection was documented in all of those cases except the @entity132 one			2
the outbreak of the @entity138 strain in the @entity128 in 2003 infected 89 people , one of whom died , according to @entity69			0
the better known @entity143 avian flu virus has infected more than 600 people since 2003 , of which 371 have died , according to the @entity30			0
in february , @entity5 reported two new human cases of @entity143 in the southern province of @entity147 , both of whom were in a critical condition , the @entity30 said			1
a spike in @entity143 deaths , many of them children , has been reported in @entity154 , prompting concern among health authorities			2
