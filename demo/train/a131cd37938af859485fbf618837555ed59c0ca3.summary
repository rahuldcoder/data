@entity1 , @entity0 -- strange lights in the sky , mysterious flashes , dozens of witnesses , a missing wind turbine blade and a tabloid splash featuring the pun : @entity11 farm harm			1
the @entity15 tabloid newspaper 's @entity13 splash			1
let 's hope there is n't intelligent life out there watching us			2
@entity22 's tabloid @entity15 newspaper thursday proclaimed from its front page that a wind turbine was ruined after a @entity13 hit one of its 20 meter - long blades in @entity27 , @entity28			1
@entity29 , who lives near the damaged turbine , told @entity15 she was in her car when she saw strange lights in the sky			1
" the lights were moving across the sky towards the wind farm			1
then i saw a low flying object			0
it was skimming across the sky towards the turbines			2
" apparently , hours later , she and her husband were woken by a big bang ; one of the turbine 's three blades had gone			1
it , was , however , on the ground below			0
other locals told the newspaper that the lights looked like " balls of flames			1
" @entity54 , a @entity13 expert , told the newspaper : " balls of light were seen in the sky and the @entity59 [ @entity59 ] has no explanation			1
it must have taken a pretty massive object			0
we are very , very , very excited			0
" however , @entity66 newspaper 's web site content director @entity67 had a simple explanation for all those " balls of light " in the sky			1
she told @entity66 the lights were fireworks her brother @entity74 had bought at the local garden center for the 80th birthday party of dad @entity77			2
" it was a medium - sized fireworks display with absolutely no ballistics , and the fireworks were mostly dropping over my parents ' house			0
but we were laughing that we could have broken the wind turbine , " @entity67 said			1
" there we are in the middle of a scoop and we 're beaten to it by a red - top tabloid , " @entity67 's mother @entity84 , 74 , told @entity66			2
later thursday , the @entity88 reported the blade may have come off after a mechanical failure			0
@entity91 , chief executive of @entity92 , which insures more than 25,000 wind turbines worldwide , told @entity94 that although it was unusual , this kind of incident happened up to six times a year			0
" it does happen that a blade will sometimes just come off a machine for one reason or another , " he said			0
" the main reason is the blade may shear			0
" we do n't normally see things like aircraft -- or @entity13 -- hitting them			2
it 's usually a mechanical failure that causes the blade to separate from the main hub			2
" he said the cold weather was another possible cause			0
dr @entity114 , an expert in the design and manufacture of wind turbine blades at the @entity118 , agreed			1
he told the @entity119 that if the turbine blade was still , it would take a 10 - tonne load to remove a blade , but if it was rotating the force could be a lot less			1
" it 's definitely not a bird			0
it could be ice thrown from a neighbouring turbine that struck it			0
" aliens out of control or simple mechanical failure ? a case for @entity136 ? what do you think ?			0

@entity22 tabloid blames @entity13 for destroying wind turbine blade
