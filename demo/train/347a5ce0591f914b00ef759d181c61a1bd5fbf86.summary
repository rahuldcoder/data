-- @entity1 is well known for being a tight ship , but apparently one of its board members forgot to batten down the hatches			1
that would be the most famous member of the board : @entity10 laureate and former @entity12 vice president @entity11			1
speaking at the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity11 interjected the following aside into his speech : " not to mention the new iphones coming out next month			1
" that may not sound like a huge blunder -- after all , the fact that the @entity21 is going on sale at some point next month currently ranks as one of the world 's worst - kept secrets			2
but take note : nobody at @entity1 has officially confirmed it yet			1
even the october 4 unveiling , leaked to @entity30 wednesday morning , is still just a report			0
@entity32 an invite has been seen			0
note also the plural in @entity11 's aside			2
it is possible that he was referring to multiple copies of the @entity21 , but that seems unlikely -- especially as we 've been hearing rumors for months of a lower - cost , lower - memory version dubbed the @entity41			0
@entity11 has been an @entity1 board member for more than eight years , and this is the first time we 've seen him let slip even the slightest detail on an upcoming product			1
given the company 's code of secrecy , such an unwarranted statement in a prepared talk -- he was n't even being interviewed -- counts as a major breach of discipline			0
if this were an @entity1 employee , or even any other board member , we 'd fear for his future at 1 @entity56			2
@entity11 , of course , is a heavy - hitter at the company who 's done a lot of work on making @entity1 products more sustainable and reducing his carbon footprint			1
we 're guessing he gets a pass this time			0
but @entity65 , take note : your ship is not as tight as you might like			0
