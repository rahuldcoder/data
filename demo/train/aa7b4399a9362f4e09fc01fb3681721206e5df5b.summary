scientists who pulled off a huge achievement in space exploration showed numerous black - and - white images thursday of where they think the @entity7 probe landed on a comet 310 million miles from @entity8			1
many at the @entity9 have gone without sleep in the last few days , nervously anticipating whether @entity7 's difficult journey would actually end in success			1
a few who spoke to reporters in @entity15 , @entity16 , choked up and said how much the mission -- dubbed @entity18 -- means to them and to space exploration			2
" @entity18 is trying to answer the very big questions about the history of our solar system , " said @entity20 , @entity18 project scientist			1
" what were the conditions like at its infancy and how did it evolve ? what role did comets play in this evolution ? how do comets work ? " there were flaws with the landing -- anchoring harpoons did n't deploy when @entity7 made impact , lander manager @entity39 said , and screws meant to burrow into the surface did n't work			1
but @entity7 bounced at least twice , they said , and stuck the landing			2
and that was all that counts			0
a jubilant @entity44 , who has reportedly spent more than two decades working on the @entity18 mission , showed photos that scientists were just beginning to receive			2
@entity9 scientists and executives high - fived and hugged one another when the landing was confirmed on wednesday			2
spacecraft have crashed into comets before , but this was the first controlled landing in history			0
" our ambitious @entity18 mission has secured a place in the history books : not only is it the first to rendezvous with and orbit a comet , but it is now also the first to deliver a lander to a comet 's surface , " @entity57 , @entity9 's director general , said in a statement			1
many people , and not just the ones who work for @entity9 , are excited about what kind of information @entity7 will deliver			1
and science fiction writer @entity73 said , " this is science fiction made real in terms of the achievement of the mission itself , but @entity18 is also taking us a step closer to answering science fiction 's grandest question of all : are we alone ? " @entity18 took off from @entity8 10 years ago , aboard an ariane 5 rocket , and traveled a total of 6.4 billion miles before rendezvousing with the comet in august			2
the @entity7 lander separated from the orbiting @entity18 around 3:30 a.m. et wednesday and landed on the comet seven hours later			1
@entity9 lander system engineer @entity86 told @entity1 that the orbiter had to be in the right position to allow the lander craft , which had no thrusters , to " free fall " on the correct trajectory so it landed on the comet			1
the lander weighs about 220 pounds and is the size of a domestic washing machine			0
the target comet is only 4 kilometers , or 2.5 miles , in diameter			0
shortly after landing was confirmed , the probe tweeted : " touchdown ! my new address : @entity101 ! " later , it tweeted again : " i 'm on the surface but my harpoons did not fire			0
" what can we learn from comet landing ? the mission has historic allusions			0
the spaceship is named after the @entity111 , an inscribed piece of volcanic rock found in @entity114 in 1799 that allowed scientists to decipher hieroglyphics and thus understand the ancient @entity114 culture , @entity9 said			2
the lander is named after an island in the @entity120 where an obelisk was found that helped decipher the @entity111 , @entity9 said			0
led by @entity9 with a consortium of partners including @entity125 , scientists on the @entity18 comet - chasing mission hope to learn more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the solar wind : high energy particles blasted into space by the sun. the comet is currently 500 million kilometers ( 310 million miles ) from @entity8 and pictures from the @entity18 mission to track it on its orbit around the sun have amazed scientists			1
we can land on a comet , but we ca n't ... @entity7 is equipped with an array of experiments to photograph and test the surface of @entity101 as well as to find out what happens when the roasting effect of the sun drives off gas and dust			1
built by a @entity154 consortium , led by the @entity155 , the landing probe has nine experiments			0
according to details on @entity9 's @entity18 website , sensors on the lander will measure the density and thermal properties of the surface , gas analyzers will help detect and identify any complex organic chemicals that might be present , while other tests will measure the magnetic field and interaction between the comet and solar wind			1
what is a comet and what will @entity172 discover @entity7 also carries a drill that can drive 20 centimeters ( 8 inches ) into the comet and deliver material to its on board ovens for testing			1
scientists are already pleased with progress of the mission , and they 're wowed by what 's already been accomplished			0
@entity182 took questions from reporters about the failure of the harpoons , answering them in great detail			0
he appeared to get mildly frustrated , though , and implored that failure not be the focus			0
" it 's gorgeous where we are ! " he said			0
how comet mission helps search for alien life @entity1 's @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0

experts are excited about what kind of information @entity7 will deliver
@entity7 has nine experiments including drill to sample the surface , *onboard* oven
