the finger - pointing began almost immediately -- and with good reason			0
a mere few inches of snow had shut down @entity4 , forcing children to spend the night at schools , stranding drivers on interstates and making the city a laughingstock to the country			1
why did this happen ? who 's to blame ? and , more importantly , could this happen elsewhere ? perhaps			1
unlike @entity18 and @entity19 , with their long - established infrastructures and diverse mass transit systems , @entity15 resembles the new @entity21 city			1
it 's not just a city but also a region ; a metro area that claims its outlying suburbs as its own -- as do @entity27 and @entity28 and @entity29			1
it spans 28 counties sprawled over an area the size of @entity34			0
on tuesday , a rare weather phenomenon mixed with poor planning and an overdependence on cars conspired to create a perfect storm			1
what can other cities learn from @entity4 's debacle ? let 's comb through the claims and realities : ugly remnants after storm clobbers @entity47 @entity48 : this fiasco could have been avoided if @entity15 had a mass transit system like @entity18 's or @entity51 's both @entity4 mayor @entity52 and @entity54 gov. @entity53 put much of the blame on the fact that everyone -- government , businesses and schools -- all tried to go home at the same time , clogging highways for hours			1
" i said immediately yesterday that releasing all of these folks was not the right way to go , " @entity52 said wednesday			0
" if i had my druthers , we would have staggered the closures			0
" reality : yes , it could have but the problem highlights how @entity15 and cities like it depend almost exclusively on cars			1
@entity15 does have a commuter train system , but it does n't serve the whole metro area			1
while the city has a workday population of 1 million , the metro area 's population is 6 million			1
and when offices and schools let out tuesday , the masses got into their cars to head to the suburbs			0
an expansive public transportation system would have undoubtedly alleviated some of the ensuing traffic stress			1
this week 's debacle is also disturbing because if another catastrophe were to hit and roads were the only path out , @entity15 would be in the same situation again			1
while a recent poll shows that many in the metro @entity4 area support expanded mass transit , the city has n't figured out a way to pay for it			1
a transportation tax proposal recently failed , with some saying it would have spent too much money on roads instead of light rail			2
was @entity4 asleep at the wheel ? @entity48 : @entity4 needs a city government more like @entity19 's former lt. gen. @entity106 , who coordinated relief efforts along the @entity108 after @entity105 , said things would have gone more smoothly this week if @entity4 's city government was more like @entity19 's			1
" they need to have in @entity4 the same type of government you have in @entity19 , where the mayor controls the city and everything around that city , and the mayor can make decisions on road closures ; he has emergency powers as when schools close , " he said			1
the schools and the government should have been closed tuesday , he said			0
reality : the metro area has many leaders @entity4 comprises 140 cities and towns -- most of which have their own leaders making their own decisions			0
and even within the city of @entity4 , @entity52 does n't call all the shots , like @entity19 's mayor			1
@entity52 said he does n't have the ultimate say on some issues			2
for example , @entity138 was responsible for deciding when to send students home			2
and the state is responsible for clearing interstate freeways			1
but the mayor also said he would have done some things differently			2
" we made a mistake by not staggering when people should leave , so i will take responsibility for that -- in lessons learned , " @entity52 said wednesday			0
" if we had to do it again , we would have said , ' schools , you go first , private sector , you go second , and government goes last			0
' and so i think that would have helped			0
" @entity158 - stranded children @entity48 : this was an " unexpected storm , " and @entity15 did n't play it safe like @entity161 did as thousands of @entity4 commuters sat motionless on interstates tuesday night into wednesday , @entity54 's governor said the path of the storm caught officials off guard			1
" we have been confronted with an unexpected storm that has hit the metropolitan @entity4 area , " @entity53 told reporters late tuesday night			2
he said as of 10 a.m. et on tuesday , " it was still , in most of the forecasts , anticipated that the city of @entity4 would only have a mild dusting or a very small accumulation , if any , and that the majority of the effects of the storm would be south of here			1
preparations were made for those predictions			0
" reality : no it was n't , and @entity4 should have the @entity186 put the entire @entity4 metro area under a winter storm warning at 3:38 a.m. tuesday			1
the agency warned of 1 to 2 inches of snow accumulation and said it would begin " as early as mid-morning and last into tonight			0
" @entity192 meteorologist @entity191 said @entity4 had plenty of warning			0
@entity191 himself had predicted that up to 2 inches of snow would fall			0
in reality , just over 2 inches of snow landed in @entity4			0
while that 's nothing for most @entity200 cities , it can be a huge burden for @entity203 cities not accustomed to it			2
contrast @entity15 's response to @entity161 '			1
it , too , was hit with snow and ice this week , but it decided to play it safe by closing certain roads			2
to be sure , @entity161 responded slowly to the disastrous @entity105			0
but it 's learned to heed warnings			2
@entity54 's governor said he 's also learned from this week			1
" we all have some lessons we need to learn here from this , " @entity53 said			0
" and i think we all will			0
" opinion : stranded in @entity4 @entity48 : @entity15 did n't pre-treat roads the way @entity218 ( and many other @entity200 cities ) do it was a common refrain from drivers who sat more than 10 hours on @entity4 roads : where are the salting trucks ? @entity225 spent half a day in her car before she gave up , got out and carried her son 2 miles to a stranger 's house , where they spent the night			1
during those 12 hours , she did n't see a single salting truck or snowplow			2
" it was disheartening , " @entity225 said			0
" i felt like everyone knew this was coming			0
" she said the amount of snow " was not that horrible			0
" but " @entity4 was not prepared for it			0
" reality : @entity15 is n't entirely responsible , and the city does n't have the capacity while many pointed their fingers at the mayor , @entity4 's only responsible for surface streets in the city			1
it 's actually the state that 's responsible for maintaining interstates , where much of the gridlock occurred			1
the @entity249 commissioner said crews had been deployed farther south , but then scrambled closer to @entity4 as the storm got under way			2
but the traffic already choking the roads also blocked salt and sand trucks and snowplows			2
@entity191 , who is originally from @entity218 , @entity19 , said streets there are salted well in advance of a coming storm			2
but @entity4 does n't have the capacity for that kind of treatment			0
" we simply have never purchased the amount of equipment necessary , " he said			0
" why would you in a city that gets one snow event every three years ? why would you buy 500 snowplows and salt trucks and have them sit around for 1,000 days , waiting for the next event ? " stranded drivers tell their stories			0

@entity15 does n't have a diverse transit system
the city 's mayor does n't call all the shots
the state , not the city , is responsible for treating interstate roads
the governor said he was caught off guard by the storm 's path
