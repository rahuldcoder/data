-- nearly 150 years after it was left behind at a @entity3 prison camp , the 3 - inch clay pipestem still shows a @entity6 soldier 's teeth marks			1
the pipe , whose stem features the name of its manufacturer , proves the resourcefulness of a prisoner who really wanted his tobacco			2
he fashioned the bowl from lead , possibly by melting rifle bullets			2
no one knows what became of the unknown soldier at @entity22 , which during its short existence in south @entity24 was the @entity25 's largest prison camp			2
" his name his been lost to history but his story has not , " said @entity26 , who led a group of college students that found the exact location of the camp 's slave - built stockade and , in the soil beneath tall pine trees , nearly 200 artifacts			1
those are the first of what is expected to be a treasure of artifacts that will bear witness to the lives of prisoners and the horrors they endured			1
the find was detailed wednesday by the @entity47 , the @entity48 and @entity49			1
the artifacts were found this spring on federal property , the currently closed @entity52			1
the camp 's location also extends into state property , the adjoining @entity22			2
visitors got a chance to learn more about the dig in wednesday 's open house at the state park			2
only archaeologists and other officials are allowed on the actual dig site			1
this discovery of so many @entity3 - era items -- including the smoking pipe , uniform buttons , a picture frame , coins , utensils , bullets and objects fashioned by @entity6 prisoners -- is unparalleled for many reasons , archaeologists said			1
and the prisoner belongings from little - known @entity22 are believed to represent just a fraction of what will be uncovered , cleaned and analyzed for up to 30 years			2
with the exception of a farmer 's plow 100 years ago , the 42 acres near @entity78 , @entity24 , have been largely free of human touch			2
that includes being missed by relic hunters and looters who , said @entity88 , regional archaeologist and historic preservation officer for the @entity47 , " are both thieves of time			1
" over the years , people have picked clean known @entity3 sites , including the notorious @entity92 in west - central @entity24 , about 120 miles away			1
@entity22 was built to help ease @entity92 's overcrowding			2
" this site is unusually undisturbed , " said @entity88			1
" for @entity3 sites , this is an amazing thing			2
" the site 's remote location and maps describing it as brushy and overgrown likely saved it from relic hunters , archaeologists said			1
still , that has n't stopped some relic hunters from trying to reach the fenced - in site			1
about a half dozen have been stopped by state park officials , said natural resources commissioner @entity109 , who said they were released with a warning			2
prosecutions may follow for violators now that the dig is public knowledge , he said			2
some of the artifacts will go on display starting october 10 at the @entity118 in @entity119 , about 40 miles south of the camp site			1
officials said the public eventually will be able to watch excavations at @entity22 , which was described after the war as " foul and fetid			2
" using modern technology along with shovels , prisoner drawings and topographic maps , the @entity49 archaeology students found the stockade site at one of four investigative sites they studied at the federal hatchery and state park			1
they believe excavations will produce finds that will surpass their initial modest expectations of finding the rectangular stockade 's perimeter			2
" even in the short term , the site will provide a glimpse into the trials and tribulations of @entity3 soldiers , " said @entity88			1
early this spring , team leader @entity26 found a @entity149 cent of a type that was last manufactured in 1858 , six years before @entity22 opened for its brief but deadly six - week existence			1
students then began finding other precious objects			2
" when i picked up things , literally the hair stood up on my neck , " said @entity154 , an anthropology professor in the @entity155 at @entity49			1
she served as adviser to the dig crews			2
nails and other items showed that the sloped camp was the living area for nearly 10,000 men who built shelters and lean - tos near @entity22			1
having just survived the scorching 1864 summer , they dug into the earth to shelter them from a cold winter , which included a november snowfall			0
then , suddenly , in late november 1864 , the camp was abandoned			0
the prisoners were taken to other camps as the @entity175 approached during the famous @entity176			0
archaeologists think that prisoners may have been taken to the depot in @entity78 in the middle of the night , and were forced to leave behind their camp belongings and keepsakes from their homes up north			0
the items , possibly numbering in the thousands , were eventually swallowed up by the earth			1
" it 's been a series of ' @entity190 this is huge ' moments , " @entity26 , 36 , said of the archaeological dig. between 725 and 1,330 men died at the prison camp in its six weeks			1
officials said they know the " general vicinity " of soldier graves , but have no plans to disturb them			0
conditions in northern pow camps often were n't much better			0
about 3,000 imprisoned @entity201 , for example , died in @entity202 , @entity203			0
" some of the saddest part of our history was the handling of prisoners on both sides , " said @entity204 , professor emeritus of history at @entity206 in @entity207			0
wednesday 's announcement could n't come at a better time for @entity78 and @entity216 , where unemployment hovers near a staggering 20 percent			0
most of the town 's manufacturing jobs are gone			0
" we have an incredible opportunity for heritage tourism in this community , " said @entity109			0
" i 've never lost hope " about bringing in jobs , said @entity224 , chairwoman of the county 's development authority			0
she said she hopes a museum related to the archaeology and perhaps a re-creation of a section of the prison stockade will be erected			0
once the digs resume , @entity22 , which had 114,000 visitors in 2009 , also could get a needed boost			0
" we see the park as growing , " said @entity237 , @entity24 parks director			0
there are no known photos of @entity22 and few details of the stockade , but a @entity6 mapmaker painted watercolors of the prison			0
he also kept a 5,000 - page journal that included descriptions of the misery at the camp			0
" the weather has been rainy and cold at nights , " pvt. @entity252 , who was previously imprisoned at @entity92 , wrote in his diary on november 1			0
" many prisoners have died from exposure , as not more than half of us have any shelter but a blanket propped upon sticks			0
... our rations have grown smaller in bulk too , and we have the same hunger as of old			0
" among @entity252 's watercolors from @entity22 are two depicting the stockade wall and a brick oven with a tall chimney			0
@entity26 and about eight other @entity49 graduate students used the painting to help locate the dig site			1
they found bricks that may be remains of one of the camp 's ovens depicted by @entity252 , @entity154 said			1
the land slipped into obscurity for about 70 years , when some of it became part of @entity22			0
until this spring , a few entrenchments were the only signs of @entity22			0
that began to change in late june , when federal officials erected a locked and guarded fence to safeguard the artifacts found at its hatchery , which will reopen in spring 2011			1
they will work with their @entity24 counterparts to ensure the site is not touch by unauthorized individuals			1
" the illegal antiquity marketplace is a global marketplace , " @entity88 said			0
although the public is mesmerized by artifacts , historians and archaeologists consider them mainly as tools to understand the past			1
" what 's important is not just the artifacts but the context , " said @entity88			1
what , they wonder , were these soldiers like ? how did they adapt to their harsh environment , where disease was a deadly companion ? how did they organize camp life ? some coins , tokens and other objects that have been found were made in @entity318 , and indicate @entity6 regiments made up of soldiers with @entity322 and @entity323 ancestry , @entity26 said			1
one of the dig sites was open to the public over several weekends during the spring			0
@entity26 recalls one " magical day ' when a descendant of a @entity6 prisoner and a descendant of a @entity25 guard stopped by to observe			0
the government and @entity49 are not currently digging the site			1
they are devising a comprehensive plan of research , excavation and conservation			0
the next dig is expected to begin this fall on the state park side of @entity22			0
students will try to find the stockade 's corners and evidence of the camp commandant 's headquarters and other buildings			0
" we found more than we ever dreamed of , " said @entity88			1
" this is truly a unique site , one that belongs to all @entity149			1
" like other speakers wednesday , @entity149 rep. @entity349 of @entity24 talked about @entity22 's legacy			0
" it 's one of those places where triumph and tragedy are mixed , " he said .			0

about 200 artifacts were found in early archaeological investigations
the site is unusual in that it has not been picked over by relic hunters
some of the items will go on display in october at @entity49
