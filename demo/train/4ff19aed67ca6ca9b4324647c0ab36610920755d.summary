-- january 12 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : it 's a pleasure to welcome you to this midweek edition of @entity0			1
we 're bringing the world , without commercials , to your classroom			2
and i 'm your captain , @entity22			2
first up : @entity23 @entity24 : doctors are keeping a close watch on @entity4 representative @entity27			1
three days after a gunman tried to assassinate her at an event in @entity30 , @entity27 was responding to doctors ' commands and giving hopeful signs , though her condition remained critical			2
experts say if she survives , her recovery could take anywhere from several months to a year and a half			1
meantime , president @entity39 was scheduled to fly to @entity30 today			1
the @entity40 says he 'll probably attend a memorial service and meet with some families of the shooting victims			1
six people were killed and 14 wounded in the attack			2
there 's a national conversation building around part of this story , and we 're gon na include you in it			1
here 's what 's going on : this man you 're about to see here , an @entity4 sheriff named @entity55 , has been talking about the @entity4 shooter , and what might have influenced him to attack			1
here 's part of the sheriff 's opinion : @entity55 , sheriff of @entity64 , @entity4 : when the rhetoric about hatred , about mistrust of government , about paranoia of how government operates , and to try to inflame the public on a daily basis , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , has impact on people , especially who are unbalanced personalities to begin with			1
@entity24 : the sheriff , who 's a @entity77 , is suggesting that conservative talk show hosts and media coverage of people who are angry at the government somehow influenced the @entity4 shooter			1
but police have not discussed an official motive for the attack			2
and another sheriff , @entity84 , another @entity4 sheriff , says all the evidence so far suggests the gunman had no clear political motives -- that he 's just a deeply troubled and mentally unstable person			1
what do @entity88 think ? well , a new national poll by @entity91 shows most @entity88 , 57 percent , do n't think angry political speech contributed to the shooting			1
32 percent think it did			2
here 's where you come into the conversation			1
what are your thoughts on the @entity4 shooting ? are there any lessons to be learned from it ? our blog is always open at @entity107 ! what 's the word @entity110 , @entity14 : what 's the @entity109 ? a type of storm with extremely strong winds that blow from the northeast @entity116 that 's the word ! winter storm update @entity24 : chances are , if you live on @entity88 's @entity122 and have n't yet been socked in by snow and ice , your turn is coming			1
the storm that smacked the @entity126 is now heading north			1
forecasters expect it to merge with another system from the @entity130			1
what does all that mean ? another foot of snow possible for @entity135			2
you see @entity135 here , earlier this year , reeling from storms then			1
another foot of snow is possible for @entity140 , @entity141			2
at least 30 states were under some sort of winter storm watch or warning yesterday			1
and the south ? still crippled by chaotic conditions			2
the snow that covered the streets froze into a hard sheet of ice monday night			0
driving was out -- even walking was dangerous in some spots			0
@entity153 stepped outside @entity154 to show us why this is such a big deal for the @entity126			1
@entity153 ? ( begin video ) @entity158 , @entity159 : check it out , @entity22			0
@entity161 and ice on the sidealks of downtown @entity164			0
yeah , it 's happened before but not sticking around for days at a time			1
what an amazing , incredible ice storm this was , and snow storm , across the @entity170 , especially for @entity164			1
we seem to have been right in the core of the heaviest snow			0
and then , bam ! the freezing temperatures and the freezing rain coming on top of that just really crippling this entire metropolitan area			0
from downtown to the interstates we had jack - knifed tractor trailers all over the place			0
on that 285 loop which is designed to take the tractor trailers out of the downtown area , well , that did n't help entirely too much			0
so , the other thing that 's not helping is the storm cranking up the @entity188			1
that 's bringing in even more cold air			1
even though we get times where it gets above freezing during the day			0
at night the temperatures drop well below freezing			0
you got to look at this and say to yourself , @entity164 's mentality for snow removal is let it melt			1
well , we may have to wait for quite some time , @entity22 ? ( @entity200 ) oil spill report @entity24 : thanks , @entity153			0
if we do n't take drastic action to prevent this in the future , it could happen again			0
that 's the word from a final report on last summer 's catastrophic oil spill in the @entity5			1
it started with this , an explosion on the @entity214 drilling rig			0
that later sank and caused the worst oil spill in @entity88 history			0
the clean - up is still going on for this ! the " @entity227 on the @entity228 and @entity229 " says the government and the oil industry need to research more , invest more money , and keep better tabs on safety and knowledge of how to contain oil spills			0
@entity230 @entity231 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity234 's exploratory class at @entity235 in @entity236 , @entity237 ! @entity238 is the capital of what country ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity246 , b ) @entity245 , c ) @entity6 or @entity247 ) @entity248 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity238 is the capital of the @entity251 nation of @entity6			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity6 then & now @entity24 : it 's been exactly one year since that capital -- and much of @entity6 -- were violently shaken to the ground by a tremendous earthquake			1
flooding and disease outbreaks have further slowed down @entity6 's recovery			1
still needed there : safe water and sewage systems , training for health workers , money to help get rid of diseases			0
@entity269 describes how one year after the quake , not much has changed			1
( begin video ) @entity272 , @entity0 correspondent : my name is @entity269			0
i 'm a journalist for @entity0			0
when i came to @entity6 last january my heart broke			1
i 've covered difficult stories before but this one was particularly difficult for me			1
and i had hoped that when i came back a year later i would see a lot more progress than this			1
i 'm sitting here in the @entity283 in @entity238			0
as you can see it pretty much looks like it did last january 12			0
every sunday thousands of people come here still for services there 's no building left here so the priest preaches outside in a small park			2
the building was shattered but their faith was not shattered			0
their faith is stronger than it ever was			0
i think the most iconic image that came out in the days after the earthquake was the national palace			1
it was destroyed to the point where it had been slated for demolition			0
but very little work has been done on it since last january			0
and it 's a constant reminder to the people of what happened here			2
this is the @entity310 in @entity238 , the central plaza in the city			0
slowly in the days and weeks after the earthquake , a tent city sprung up here , and the more the time went by people realized , " we 're not going anywhere , we 're going have to make new homes , new lives for ourselves right here			2
" there 's a grocery store , there 's a cyber cafe , even			2
the tent city has become a little city within the larger city of @entity238			0
it 's pretty shocking to see that a year later people are still living like this			1
i 'm always amazed when i come back to @entity6 to see how much strength the people here have			1
it 's just incredible to me how they are able to go on			2
i just ca n't imagine having to live through something like this day after day after day			0
( @entity200 ) promo @entity24 : remarkable images in that report			0
we want you to intro our show ! and at @entity107 , we have a video that explains how you can send us a video ! you just scroll down our home page , which you see right here			0
find the " how @entity348 " box -- it 's on the left side			2
and click on " how do i send @entity0 my @entity351 ? " yours truly will pop up with a totally different haircut , and give you step - by - step instructions on sending your footage to us			0
before we go @entity24 : well , i used to read @entity358 in high school , maybe that 's why i picture sled dogs as huskies , dragging wood and steel through the @entity364			2
this is a different kind of animal			0
a slack dog , not a pack dog			0
a coaster , not a boaster			0
a chiller , not a thriller ! he and his owner show the other side of @entity164 's icy conditions : the fun shared by man and beast , when you 've got nowhere to go but downhill			2
goodbye @entity24 : just hope he stayed warm			0
without a sweater , a hot dog can quickly turn into a pup - sicle			0
please join us again tomorrow -- @entity0 only has ice for you			0
