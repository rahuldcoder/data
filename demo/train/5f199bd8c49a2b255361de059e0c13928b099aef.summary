-- @entity1 has told @entity0 he may make another attempt to win the @entity3 singles gold medal he craves in @entity5 in four years ' time			1
the world no. 1 was pipped to the @entity9 crown by @entity11 's @entity10 -- the man @entity1 beat to secure his seventh @entity14 title just over a month ago			1
the 30 - year - old has won 17 grand slams in his illustrious career and took gold in the doubles with @entity20 in @entity21 four years ago , but he has failed to win the singles title in four attempts			1
despite the disappointment he felt at being brushed aside 6 - 2 6 - 1 6 - 4 by @entity10 and missing out on topping the podium , @entity1 did at least claim his first solo medal			1
" i 'm not sure yet , it 's four years away			2
i can retire in the meantime and come again ! " @entity1 told @entity0 about his hopes of an @entity3 appearance in @entity31			1
" but i 'm not going to do that , i 'm going to keep on playing			2
i hope i can do it			0
i 'm turning 31 in a few days , so i 'll be 35 for @entity5 -- i think it 's possible but we 'll see how it goes			1
" @entity10 conquers @entity1 to take @entity3 gold at @entity14 a gold medal would have capped a perfect month for @entity1 , after his victory at @entity14 catapulted him back to the top of the world rankings			1
and once the bitter sting of defeat on @entity43 had subsided , @entity1 insisted finally getting his hands on a singles medal tempered the disappointment of his straight - sets loss			1
" i 'd have to say i was very disappointed for three to five minutes , " he said			0
" i was in a little room waiting for the ceremony , i saw @entity50 and @entity10 and i saw how happy they were for gold , for bronze			2
" of course i 'd just lost my match where @entity50 had to win the bronze over @entity56			0
so i was in the middle and i was the only one who 'd lost that day			0
" i thought , ' hmmm , i could either be sad right now , extremely sad , or extremely proud and happy , ' and i chose to be extremely happy and proud			0
" it was a dream summer for me			0
i won @entity14 and i returned to world no. 1 and i tried everything i could to win @entity3 gold , and i just came up against a better player on the day			1
" so for me silver is the maximum i could get out of the @entity3 this time around			2
i was just extremely happy , like a little kid there on the podium			0
" @entity69 crushes @entity70 to achieve the @entity71 @entity10 's victory offered the @entity74 recompense for his heartbreaking defeat in the @entity14 final -- the first time a @entity78 male had reached the showpiece event since 1938			1
the 25 - year - old beat former world no. 1 @entity56 on his way to the final , and also claimed silver in the mixed doubles with @entity83			1
and @entity1 paid tribute to his rival for winning his first major tennis title less than a month after losing his fourth grand slam final			2
" i thought he played great , " @entity1 said			2
" what a champion , to come back from losing in the finals of @entity14 , resting , preparing			0
" with the pressure , okay he had home advantage -- you can see that as an advantage or a disadvantage -- but for him to come back and win the @entity3 , people sort of expected him to maybe do that			2
why @entity1 's friend flew the @entity100 flag " but he came through @entity56 and through me , who he lost to at the finals at @entity14 , that 's the sign of a champion			1
" i always knew he had it in him but it was good to see he did n't let his head hang and was disappointed and upset and sour about his loss at @entity14			0
" he should have been proud of it and that 's what i told him then			2
i hope he enjoys this victory like he should because it was a big victory for him			0
" @entity1 survives marathon semifinal @entity1 admitted his challenge for the gold was dampened by his marathon semifinal against @entity121 's @entity50 -- the longest in @entity3 history at four hours and 26 minutes			1
the deciding set was eventually won 19 - 17 by @entity1 but the @entity100 refused to blame tiredness for his lackluster performance			1
" i missed a lot of opportunities , i think i made zero of nine break points and he made four out of 10			0
we were n't that far away from each other but he pulled away , " he said			0
" i think with the crowd he got momentum and it was hard to stop			0
maybe emotionally i was a bit drained , or physically a bit slow at times after the @entity50 match , but i had a day to rest so no excuses , he was the better player on the day			0
" i have regrets , a little bit , but i tried everything i could but it was n't enough			0
