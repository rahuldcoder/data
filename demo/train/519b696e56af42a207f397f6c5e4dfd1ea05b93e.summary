-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 apologized monday for what he called his staff 's " overreaction " to a disparaging tweet directed at him by a high school senior during a state @entity9 visit			1
@entity11 , 18 , said late sunday that a @entity1 staffer had notified her school 's principal about the tweet , and the principal told her she had to write an apology to the governor			1
on monday -- the deadline for the letter , according to the teen -- the @entity22 issued a statement stating that " she is not required to write a letter of apology to the governor			1
" a statement issued by @entity1 on monday did not reference @entity11 by name or mention the prospect of any apology letter			1
he did emphasize his support for " freedom of speech , " while thanking " the thousands of @entity2 educators who remind us daily of our liberties , as well as the values of civility and decorum			1
" " my staff overreacted to this tweet , and for that i apologize , " the governor said			0
" freedom of speech is among our most treasured freedoms			0
" @entity46 : school district responds the teen made national headlines last week for a tweet she said was intended just for her friends			1
during a @entity53 field trip to the state @entity9 on november 21 , @entity11 wrote : " just made mean comments at gov brownback and told him he sucked , in person # heblowsalot			2
" the @entity59 senior said she did not actually talk to @entity1 , and the post referenced a joke she had with a student on the trip			2
the next day , she was called into high school principal @entity65 's office			1
" i had no idea what it was about or why i was being called into the office , " she said			2
" i had never been in trouble before			0
" @entity11 claimed that the principal " told me he needed to do damage control and was really upset			0
" opinion : the girl who dared tweet gov. @entity1 " he said i was an embarrassment to the school and the school district and that i had been disrespectful , " she added			1
the principal then asked her to write a letter of apology to @entity1 and his staff			2
he set monday as the due date for the letter			0
@entity0 contacted @entity65 's office but received no response			1
@entity11 said sunday night -- when she still thought the apology letter was due -- that she would n't write it , adding that her parents and many of her peers supported her decision			2
" i do n't think i should write the letter , and i do n't think it would be the best move for me , " she said			0
" at this time , i do not think an apology would be a sincere thing for me to do			0
" but that appeared to become a moot point when " district officials " in @entity103 reviewed the case and asserted monday that no apology was required and that no " further action " is expected on the issue			1
" the district acknowledges a student 's right to freedom of speech and expression is constitutionally protected , " the district said in its statement			2
" the district has not censored miss @entity11 nor infringed upon her freedom of speech			0
" @entity11 said she had not heard from the governor 's office directly			1
but , following the media attention , her @entity116 follower count has rocketed from 65 to more than 4,000			0
" i hope that the governor realizes the power of the people and how people can make things happen , " she said			0
" i also hope he will spend his time doing more productive things			0
" at the least , the student said that she hopes the controversy surrounding her tweet will bring attention to the issue of free speech			0
" i hope there wo n't be any consequences and that my principal and the governor 's office can move on , " she said			1
" the issue is relevant and , if anything , is a starting point of dialog with the governor about his policies and how our first amendment rights can be taken away			0
" the school district likewise framed the matter as something that could be educational			1
" the issue has resulted in many teachable moments concerning the use of social media , " the district said .			0
