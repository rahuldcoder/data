kidnappers seized @entity4 , 32 , and @entity25 , 60 , on october 25 in the central @entity10 town of @entity27 after they visited humanitarian projects there , said the @entity29 , the agency for which they work			1
neither was harmed , the aid group said			2
@entity4 was going through what the @entity7 military called " @entity36 " reintegration of former hostages , according to a senior defense official			1
in most cases , the former hostage will undergo " more complete medical exams and formal , structured debriefings , " the official said			0
" an inherent and critical part of the reintegration process is the decompression period that has been established to maximize returnee health and welfare , " the official said			0
" this process normally requires a minimum of 72 hours to be effective			0
" @entity0 has learned @entity4 's father , @entity50 , will go to @entity8 to see her			1
she is not in custody and can leave when she wants but , if she stays , when ready she will be returned to the @entity7 , probably in a @entity7 military aircraft			1
president @entity53 phoned @entity54 to tell him @entity4 had been freed , @entity4 said , adding that the call had left him " flabbergasted			1
" " he said , ' @entity50 , this is @entity53			0
i 'm calling because i have great news for you			0
your daughter has been rescued by our military , ' " @entity4 said			1
@entity4 said the operation left him with an overwhelming sense of patriotism			1
" i 'm extremely proud and glad to be an @entity7 , " he said			1
" i did n't know this was going to transpire			0
i 'm glad it did			0
" he said @entity4 was " doing well , under the circumstances			1
" @entity10 's transitional government welcomed the @entity7 military operation thursday			1
the rescue of the aid workers " is a great joy to the @entity10 government and to all @entity10 as well as to all right thinking people everywhere , " the government said in a statement			1
" hitting them hard is the only language kidnappers of innocent people , pirates and terrorists understand , and every opportunity should be taken to wipe out this scourge from our country , " the government said			0
the new @entity90 envoy to @entity10 -- the first permanent @entity90 representative there in 17 years -- also expressed understanding about the military operation			1
" if negotiations fail , all means must be applied , including rescue operations , " @entity93 said thursday , even as he urged that lives be protected " on both sides			0
" @entity25 's sister and brother - in - law wept for joy when they heard he had been rescued , the brother - in - law , @entity103 , told @entity105 's @entity104			2
" she was overjoyed when she told us what happened , " @entity103 said , speaking of the daughter who gave them the news			0
students at the school in @entity116 where @entity4 used to teach also cried at the news , the dean of students there said			1
" yesterday was an exciting day for us			0
there were tears of joy on campus , " said @entity117 of @entity118 , a @entity119 international school in @entity120			0
@entity117 remembered @entity4 , who taught at the school from 2007 to 2009 , as " adventurous and a bit of a risk taker " as well as " an incredible teacher , well loved			1
" the @entity130 unit that killed @entity132 leader @entity131 last year in @entity133 participated in the rescue mission , a @entity7 official said , without specifying whether any of the same individuals were on both assaults			1
the @entity130 are part of the @entity139 , formerly known as @entity139			1
the special operations forces took fire as they fought their way into the compound where the hostages were held , the official said , adding the troops believed the kidnappers were shooting			2
the official is not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named			0
@entity149 spokesman @entity148 said the rescue team included special operations troops from different branches of the military , but would not specify the branches			2
there were no known survivors among the kidnappers , he added			0
the @entity7 assault team did not suffer any casualties , the @entity149 said			1
the @entity7 was in close contact with @entity105 before , during and after the raid , @entity161 spokeswoman @entity160 said			2
@entity165 spokesman @entity164 said , " the decision to go ahead with this rescue mission was made because there was information concerning the deteriorating health of ms. @entity4 , as well as a window of opportunity to execute this mission			1
" @entity53 , who had given the go - ahead at 9 p.m. monday , was updated on its progress throughout tuesday , @entity164 said			0
at the @entity178 address , before news broke of the rescue , @entity53 told defense secretary @entity181 , " @entity181 , good job tonight			0
" the hostages were safe at that point , but the mission was not yet complete , as the @entity7 assault team had not departed @entity10 , @entity148 said			1
in a written statement , @entity53 thanked the special operations forces for their " extraordinary courage and capabilities			2
" " the @entity7 will not tolerate the abduction of our people , and will spare no effort to secure the safety of our citizens and to bring their captors to justice , " @entity53 said			2
" this is yet another message to the world that the @entity7 will stand strongly against any threats to our people			2
" capt. @entity202 , another @entity149 spokesman , said the abductors were ordinary criminals			0
we do n't have any indication that they were connected to any terrorist group or ideological group at that point , " he said			0
" they were not @entity214 , " @entity148 said , referring to the @entity132 - linked @entity211 militia that holds sway over parts of @entity10			2
the area where the hostages were seized is known as a hub for pirates , rather than an area of @entity221 militant activity			0
a number of high - profile abductions of foreigners have occurred in @entity10 and in @entity116 , close to the largely lawless @entity10 border			2
some of the kidnappings have been blamed on @entity214 , while criminals seeking ransoms seem to have carried out others			0
the @entity7 raid comes nearly three years after @entity130 snipers killed three pirates who had taken hostage the captain of the @entity235 off @entity10			1
but the forceful @entity7 responses may not do much to deter hostage - takers in largely lawless @entity10 , one expert said , pointing out that piracy in particular is extremely lucrative			1
" the returns are so worth it that piracy will continue to be attractive to a lot of people , " said @entity240 , a researcher for the @entity242 program at the @entity244 - based think tank @entity243			0
" i do n't think pirates necessarily have the knowledge to target @entity7 citizens in particular , but obviously @entity7 and @entity253 citizens can command higher ransoms , " she said			2
@entity255 , a website that tracks piracy statistics , said over $ 150 million was paid out in ransoms in 2011			0
successful pirate attacks on merchant vessels began to drop off in 2011 in face of improved shipping security -- including on board armed security detachments - and stronger action from the foreign navies patrolling the @entity265 and @entity266			0
the @entity267 , which tracks piracy , said the number of attacks had risen but the success rate had plummeted to 12 % in the first nine months of 2011			0
the aid workers were part of the @entity29 's de-mining unit , which aims to make civilians safe from landmines and unexploded ordnance			1
@entity4 has been employed as a regional education adviser with the mine clearance unit of @entity280 since may ; @entity25 , a community safety manager with the de-mining unit , has been working in @entity283 and @entity10 since june 2009			1
@entity0 's @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290 , and journalists @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 contributed to this report .			0
