@entity0 -- it was my first chance to spend some quality time at dinner with first lady @entity6 , so i decided to do what my pal @entity7 would probably do in the same situation : get her hooked on @entity11			1
i was sitting with the first lady and @entity13 at the head table for saturday night 's @entity15 because i 'm a member of the association 's board , a front - row seat to the slew of celebrities who walked up to gawk at mrs. @entity6 and the president , who was a few seats from me			1
teen sensation @entity24 , famous - for - being - famous @entity26 , comedian @entity27 and actor @entity28 all walked up to the rope line separating the head table from the rest of the ballroom to send the first couple a shout - out			0
i was snapping pics of the celebrity parade on my @entity37 and posting them to my @entity11 account , @ edhenrycnn , during dessert , just a few minutes before the president and @entity13 would take their turns at telling some jokes			2
@entity13 , a social media skeptic , finally turned to me with squinted eyes and said in a conspiratorial tone , " are you tweeting right now ? " i confessed to @entity13 that i was , sparking mrs. @entity6 to ask me whether journalists find value in social media or whether it 's mostly trivial			1
i said i find it helpful to get feedback , good and bad , from people who follow my tweets			0
when mrs. @entity6 mentioned that she had never tweeted , i noted that the president had sent out his first tweet a few months ago from a @entity57 account to promote relief to @entity59 and wondered aloud : " why do n't you send out your first tweet on my @entity37 ? " the first lady laughed and said her press staff would n't be happy if she went rogue like that			1
besides , she said , @entity67 press secretary @entity66 would have to sign off first			2
noting that @entity66 was sitting at the other end of the head table , i stood and told the first lady i 'd ask him			1
to my surprise , @entity66 instantly told me it was a fun idea , on one condition : i had to first send out a tweet saying he had endorsed it , so that colleagues on mrs. @entity6 's staff were not blindsided			1
i typed out a tweet saying , " i am trying to coax first lady to do her first ever tweet			2
gibbs @ presssec just gave his blessing			0
" then i walked back to mrs. @entity6 to tell her the good news			1
but she told me good - naturedly , " @entity66 did not say that ; you 're lying ! " i assured the first lady i would not tell her a fib , which prompted @entity13 to jump to his feet to say he 'd go get @entity66 to sort this out once and for all			1
a laughing @entity66 came over and advised the first lady it would be a harmless exercise , but she was skeptical until the commander in chief finally weighed in			2
hearing the light - hearted argument playing out a few seats down , the president asked , " what 's going on ? " the first lady explained her dilemma , but the president waved his hand as if to say " no big deal " and told her to go for it			2
i handed the first lady my @entity37 , but it quickly became apparent that she had very little experiences with this smartphone			0
like many people , she said , " how do you type on this ? " @entity66 , who was looking over our shoulders , suggested that i type it out , so i told mrs. @entity6 to start dictating the note			1
i started my typing " from @entity115 , " as in " first lady of the @entity117			2
" she joked about the pressure of coming up with something interesting to say			0
she started simply with how she was at the dinner and dictated , " this is officially my first @entity11 " and added her thoughts about the comedy acts about to perform			0
i knew mrs. @entity6 should have called it her first " tweet , " but i did n't want to be in the uncomfortable position of correcting the first lady -- my mom would be appalled -- and sounding like a tech know - it - all			1
she asked @entity66 for his opinion on what she had dictated , and he said the proper way to say it was that it was her first tweet			2
mrs. @entity6 grilled me on whether @entity66 was right , and i said he was but i did n't want to be the one changing her words , so she politely asked me to change it so that she sounded as hip as possible			1
the final version , for the history books : " from flotus : ' here at dinner this is officially my first tweet			0
i am looking forward to some good laughs from the potus and jay ' "			0
some of my followers were particularly amused that mrs. @entity6 referred to her husband as " the potus " -- as in the president of the @entity117 -- and started re-tweeting it			1
it also got me a few more followers , which brings me back to @entity7			0
on our daily segment on his show -- the " @entity155 , " of course -- @entity7 and i tease each other about necktie choices and who has more people following our tweets			0
for the record , i have 12,313 followers as of this morning			0
@entity7 seems stuck on 11,025			0
so let me take this opportunity to encourage the first lady to set up her own @entity11 account			0
i bet it will be a smart way for her to push her initiatives , just as former first lady @entity169 now has a @entity11 account to help sell her memoirs and talk up her pet causes , too			0
besides , i 'm hoping mrs. @entity6 will follow me , and not @entity7 , since i hooked her up with her first tweet .			1
