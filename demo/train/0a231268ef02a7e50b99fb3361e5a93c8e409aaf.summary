-- traditionally , you would n't gift someone a rat -- not someone you like , anyway			2
and even if a gift - wrapped rodent was in the cards , you 'd likely shy away from the giant @entity7 pouched rat , which -- as the name suggests -- is rather large ( think cat - sized )			1
@entity11 - based @entity10 , however , thinks rats make excellent gifts			1
so much so that they 've launched an adopt - a - rat program , which allows participants to sponsor the animal			1
" it 's great for the giving season			0
it also works on @entity21			0
many people love to give their love , er , a rat , " says @entity22 , @entity10 's founder			1
despite the creatures ' reputation for thieving and spreading disease , @entity26 has proven that rats can be every bit as heroic as people			2
contrary to public opinion , rats can actually save lives -- @entity37 's rats have actually saved thousands			2
from vermin to heroes @entity26 ' rodents have many talents			0
mostly , though , they are highly trained to sniff out land mines and detect tuberculosis -- two scourges that have had a tremendously negative impact across the @entity7 continent			1
and his rats are fast			2
a single rat can clear 200 square feet in an hour ( done manually , the same area would take 50 hours to clear )			1
a tb - detection rat can evaluate 50 samples in eight minutes ( almost a day 's work for a lab technician )			1
though it 's difficult to quantify the number of landmines buried in @entity7 ( experts estimate the number is in the millions ) , there has been no shortage of casualties over the years			2
the @entity65 estimates there have been over 18,000 landmines and explosive remnants of war ( @entity69 ) casualties in the @entity71 between 1999 and 2013			0
aside from those fatalities , however , @entity26 notes that one of the most detrimental influences of mine fields is the amount of land they take up			0
" [ affected ] communities live in some kind of terror situation , where the most necessary , basic things -- like getting water and firewood or farming their land -- puts their life at peril			0
there does n't even need to be landmines present			0
as long as there 's this suspicion of landmines in these communities , there can be no real development , " he says			0
in 2006 , @entity26 started testing his " hero rats , " as he dubs them , on the mine fields in @entity97 , a country that at that time was one of the worst affected by landmines , thanks mainly to a civil war that ended in 1992			1
since then , @entity10 has cleared the country of 6,693 landmines , 29,934 small arms and ammunition , and 1,087 bombs			1
@entity97 is on track to be free of landmines by the year 's end			1
" it has affected @entity97 enormously , " says @entity22			1
" the gdp has grown and there is a lot of economic development that formerly was not possible , so the effect on society is huge			0
" next on @entity10 's list is @entity118 -- the third most mine - affected country in the world			1
together with @entity122 , they hope to bring down the number of mines considerably over the next three years			0
@entity126 screening in 2005 , the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) declared a @entity126 crisis in @entity7			1
it 's a problem @entity26 realized he could address with his sniffer rats			0
so far , they 've analyzed over 260,000 samples from health clinics in @entity135 , @entity11 and @entity136 , @entity97			1
" traditional methods ( for testing @entity126 ) are not so reliable , in an @entity7 environment at least , " he says			1
in 2011 , the organization warned against blood testing for @entity126 for its inaccuracy			1
@entity26 notes that the @entity144 in @entity7 also makes it difficult to get an accurate @entity126 reading			2
" people with hiv / aids tend to produce negative smears , as they have very few bacteria , " he says			0
" with scent detection , rats only need a few bacteria to be able to smell it			2
" the initial stages of training for the @entity126 - and mine - detection rats are fairly similar			1
when the rats are still pups , they are socialized to work with people			0
the rats are then conditioned with clicker training , so that they associate the sound of a click with a reward ( usually peanuts or bananas )			0
they are then introduced to a target scent ( @entity172 or positive tb samples )			1
@entity126 rats stay in the lab , where they are ultimately given multiple samples at one time to evaluate			1
the training takes about six months			0
mine - detection rats are moved first to a sandbox , where they are charged with sniffing out @entity172 - stuffed tea balls , before they ultimately train on a test field bearing both real and deactivated mines			2
those rats can be fully trained in nine months to a year			0
why rats ? @entity26 wanted to find a locally - sourced resolution to a local problem			2
" i was looking for an appropriate solution that communities at the bottom of the pyramid could use independent from expensive foreign know - how and technology , " he says			0
@entity26 notes that the advantage of using rodents is that they are cheap to train , cheaper to procure , and plentiful			0
including all administrative and operating costs , each @entity37 rat costs about $ 7,600 -- dogs can cost three times as much to train			2
rats also have the advantage of being too lightweight to trip off a mine ( @entity10 boasts zero casualties so far )			1
" i kept rodents as a boy , so i knew they were very trainable , sociable and intelligent creatures , " says @entity22			0
for me , this was a natural fix			0

@entity10 trains rats to scent detect landmines and @entity126
@entity10 has almost cleared @entity97 of landmines
a rat can clear a space 50 - times faster than a manual *deminer*
a rat can sniff more tb samples in 10 minutes than a lab technician can analyze in a day
