-- all the talk this season has been that @entity3 is the difference between winning the @entity6 title , or not			1
@entity7 wanted to sign him after his @entity10 side won a first championship in 44 years on the final day of the 2011 - 12 campaign			2
much to his chagrin , even the deep pockets of the club 's @entity15 owners could not tempt the @entity18			0
even worse for the @entity20 , and for @entity22 fans hoping he would stay in @entity23 , the 29 - year - old decided to join @entity24 for what has proved to be a bargain initial $ 34 million			2
having never won a title at any of his previous clubs , the striker opted for @entity30 -- and it has paid off handsomely			0
his first - half hat - trick in monday 's 3 - 0 win over struggling @entity34 clinched a record - extending 20th @entity36 crown for @entity24 , and put him back on top of the @entity6 scoring charts			1
while @entity10 's top scorer @entity40 has 11 this season , @entity39 has 24 -- one more than @entity43 's @entity42 , who may miss the rest of this season after being charged with violent conduct for biting a @entity48 opponent on sunday			1
" i 'm very happy but it 's weird			0
i had to wait for so long for my first title and it 's a great feeling , " @entity39 said in a post-match interview after @entity24 moved 16 points clear of second - placed @entity10			1
two of his goals were set up by 39 - year - old @entity56 , who claimed his 13th @entity6 title since starting his career with @entity24			1
the second was a spectacular volley following a lofted pass from @entity63 striker @entity62 , which virtually ended the game as a contest as early as the 13th minute			0
" it was a great ball from @entity62 , so the only thing i had to do was guide it right and hit it properly and it went in great , " said the @entity67 international , whose efforts this season will cost @entity24 an extra $ 2 million in add - on fees			1
he went 10 games without a goal as @entity24 crashed out of the @entity79 , but has bounced back with five in the last three matches			2
@entity62 has had to play second fiddle in the goalscoring stakes , but was able to celebrate his 400th @entity24 appearance with an impressive performance from a deeper - lying role			2
" it 's what we 've worked all year for and we 've fully deserved it			0
we won this game in the first half and it is a fantastic night for us , " @entity62 said			0
" when you lose the title it 's hard to take , and the way we did it was n't a nice feeling last time so we 've all dug in deep and all worked together and done fantastic to put ourselves in the position tonight to finish the job off			2
" last season @entity24 blew an eight - point lead before surrendering the title in the final minutes as @entity10 snatched an injury - time victory			1
this season @entity24 did not let up , while @entity10 dropped points against lesser teams			1
" you can go on and on about losing a title but at the end of the day , our consistency for the last 20 years is unbelievable , " said @entity24 manager @entity107 , who has also won 13 titles since joining in 1986			2
" the focus of the team was good , they focused on the challenge of @entity10 and came up trumps			0
" the 71 - year - old , the most successful manager since the @entity6 began in 1992 , acknowledged the contribution of @entity39 this season			1
" he 's been unbelievable , his early form in the first six months was fantastic			0
he had the spell where he did n't score ( for 10 games ) but he was unbelievable tonight			0
" @entity107 's team can break the @entity6 points record held by @entity48 with victories in the club 's four remaining games			1
" we 've now got 84 points with four games left -- we 've never done that , " he said when asked where this season 's achievement ranks			2
" we 've won most of our games , drawn three , lost four , and the goal tonight ( @entity39 's volley ) ... all the great goals we 've scored over the years , from @entity139 through @entity140 , @entity141 , that goal has joined that			1
these players have joined the pedestal			0
" while the result will likely quell any further protests against @entity24 's @entity153 owners , the @entity155 family -- unpopular after their highly leveraged takeover in 2005 -- the situation is not so positive for another @entity153 in charge of an @entity6 club			1
the defeat left @entity159 's @entity34 three points above the relegation zone , having played one more match than the third - bottom team , @entity163			1
villa manager @entity164 was relieved his side did not suffer a repeat of december 's 8 - 0 defeat at @entity48 , having gone behind after just 90 seconds against @entity24 and then trailed 3 - 0 after 32 minutes			1
" we wanted to make sure it did n't happen again			0
credit to them they kept on going against a brilliant side , the best in the country , " @entity164 said			0
they have been the best team all season			0
they work really hard , they work for each other , they have a mentality that has been here for years and years			0
the best team always wins the league			0

@entity3 nets all three goals as @entity24 clinch @entity36 title
monday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity34 ends the @entity6 reign of @entity10
win puts @entity24 16 points clear of second - placed @entity10 with four games to play
@entity39 moves to top of @entity6 scoring charts with 24 goals this season
