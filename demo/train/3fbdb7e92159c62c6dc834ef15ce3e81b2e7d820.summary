but the export euphoria was short lived : many knew that behind those chunky fish fillets , @entity8 had some economic bones to swallow			1
fish canning factory @entity29 do @entity27 , is in many ways , an example of @entity8 's economic successes and failures			1
for more than 30 years , this family - run business in the south of the country has fought crisis after crisis			0
as i get a tour of the factory , one of its co-owners , @entity45 , tells me the company has been in " pre-alert crisis since the 1970s " -- a time when the canned fish sector went into a deep crisis and many factories closed			2

" the @entity77 are looking for healthy and safe products ... a safe process is very important to the @entity77 market because they are very aware of contamination problems , of pollution problems " says @entity45			2
to secure these key distribution deals , @entity45 tells me he shows off the factory -- the canning process , the sterilization of the product and the fresh fish itself , which arrives at the port just outside the factory door -- to @entity77 distributors			1
