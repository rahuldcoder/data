-- fears of a serial killer stalking women in @entity4 , @entity5 , have prompted some residents to take matters into their own hands -- and onto the internet , with frightful results for one man			1
many residents of the city have joined a @entity15 page titled " catch the @entity16 , before he catches someone you love , " and police say a male @entity4 resident was falsely accused of being responsible for three strangulation murders and three other assaults that have occurred in the central @entity4 area in recent weeks			1
the post contained a photograph of the man and listed his address and contact information , police spokesman lt. @entity25 told @entity0			1
shortly after the posting , a group of people began gathering outside the man 's home , prompting him to call the police , according to @entity38			1
" he probably feared for his life			0
police later escorted the man to the city 's special victims unit , where he was interviewed and his dna was compared with samples taken from the scene of the three killings that all came from the same individual			1
the man 's dna did n't match the dna from the crime scenes , and he was cleared			1
police said they are unsure who made the accusation , but they believe whoever did it had a vendetta against the man and could face charges if caught			2
authorities are warning female residents not to walk alone , as police and community watch groups continue to search for the killer			1
" the task force we 've put together is sweeping the area , but we caution females in the area not go it alone at any cost , " @entity38 said			2
on tuesday night , police announced they are looking for a serial killer after it was determined that @entity49 found at the scene of the third homicide matched that found at two previous killings			1
the partially clothed body of the third victim , @entity79 , 27 , was discovered december 15 , according to police spokeswoman @entity80			2
@entity79 had been sexually assaulted and strangled			0
two other women , @entity82 , 21 , and @entity83 , 35 , were killed in november			2
police originally told @entity0 that all of the homicide victims were involved in prostitution and narcotics , but a @entity4 tv station , @entity89 , has reported that @entity82 was a nursing student who attended @entity90			1
authorities are offering a $ 30,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction , said task force capt. @entity96			0
earlier this week , authorities said they believe the attacker likely is still within a 10 - block radius of where the attacks occurred			0
police said the assault victims described the attacker as an @entity107 male in his early 20s , weighing between 160 and 170 pounds			0
authorities say they lack dna evidence that would link the three assaults , in which the victims were choked in a manner similar to the homicide victims			2
too much time had elapsed between the initial two assaults in october and the victims ' notifying police			0
" the assault victims did not come forward until police began combing the @entity16 ( neighborhood ) for suspects and potential victims following the november homicides , " @entity38 said			1
federal agents joined the investigation earlier this month , bringing in resources from the @entity127 's behavioral analysis unit , violent criminal apprehension program , and the @entity129			0
" the investigation appears to be limited to @entity4 , " @entity127 spokesman @entity130 said this week			2
" this could change if there are any indications that the subject or subjects responsible for the crimes ... are linked to similar crimes elsewhere			0
" police have said the assault victims described the attacker as an @entity107 male in his early 20s , weighing between 160 and 170 pounds			0
police said a third assault victim was pulled into an alley earlier this month			0
despite being choked , punched and hit on the head with a brick , the 33 - year - old woman escaped , and her assailant fled the scene , according to a police report .			0
