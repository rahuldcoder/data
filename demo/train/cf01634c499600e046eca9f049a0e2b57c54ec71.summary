-- @entity6 's " @entity5 " looked promising in concept and presentation , especially with the slickly produced trailers posted to @entity4			1
but it fell short due to a subpar shooting and cover system , anything - but - intelligent artificial intelligence and outdated graphics			1
it 's too bad , really , because underneath it all is an interesting espionage , role - playing game -- one in which consequences are tied to your actions			1
but it 's difficult to get past the game 's shortcomings			2
" @entity5 " is a suspense thriller in which you play as a young operative named @entity26 , part of a top secret @entity29 agency known as @entity5			1
@entity26 must traverse the globe and execute dangerous missions			0
but how you go about tackling a major conspiracy -- whose participants include fanatical terrorists , corrupt politicians and ruthless businessmen -- is up to you			2
for example , you can choose to be stealthy and hide in the shadows , enter each scene with guns blazing or use persuasion to achieve your goals			0
at the start of the game , you can choose what kind of an agent you want to be : soldier ( heavy weapon use ) , @entity49 ( stealthier spy ) , @entity51 ( good hacker ) , @entity53 ( customize your starting skills ) or the challenging @entity56 option , who has no starting skills and little equipment			2
then , as you progress through the missions , you can upgrade your skills by applying xp -- or " experience points " -- in nine skill areas			0
these include martial arts , stealth , pistol use , sabotage or technical aptitude , just to name a few			0
many of the situations in this third - person adventure have a time limit , too , which some players will love and others will loathe			0
sure , it adds thrill to the task at hand , but it can be frustrating when you run out of time quickly , such as in some of the puzzle - based mini-games that require a lot of repetition to successfully complete			0
conversations are often timed , too , so you 'll need to press a button on the controller to respond in a certain way			0
there are no bad choices , but choosing to be suave over aggressive , or vice versa , might help you get what you want easier , depending on whom you 're talking to			0
problems with " @entity5 " include inaccuracies in aiming ( the enemy can be square in your crosshairs , yet you somehow miss when you fire ) ; glitches when taking cover behind objects ( @entity26 's body gyrates when he gets too close to a corner ) ; a camera system that proves more frustrating than helpful ; enemies who just stand there and wait to be shot ; and graphics that look a few years out of date ( though some of the locations are well - designed , including memorable levels in @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 )			1
with more time and polish , " @entity5 " could have been one of the more interesting summer blockbusters , but its numerous flaws dampen the overall experience			1
that said , those looking forward to buying this single - player game might consider renting it for the weekend .			1

@entity128 has subpar shooting and outdated graphics
but at base , " @entity5 " is interesting espionage role - playing game
problems include inaccuracies in aiming , glitches when taking cover
*reviewer* gives the game *2.5* of 4 stars
