-- scientists in @entity2 have unearthed the remains of a true prehistoric monster believed to be the biggest snake ever to have lived on @entity6			1
an artist 's impression of what @entity9 would have looked like			2
named @entity9 , the snake would have weighed 1,140 kilograms ( 2,500 pounds ) and measured 13 meters ( 42.7 feet ) nose to tail tip -- dwarfing the largest modern pythons and anacondas which can grow to 6 meters ( 19.5 feet )			1
scientists believe it slithered around the planet between 58 and 60 million years ago			1
geologist @entity18 , who identified the position of the fossil vertebrae which made a size estimate possible , said in a statement wednesday : " at its greatest width , the snake would have come up to about your hips			2
the size is pretty amazing			2
" but our team went a step further and asked , how warm would the @entity6 have to be to support a body of this size ? " @entity9 's fossilized remains were discovered at a coal mine in the tropical @entity34 region of northern @entity2 by an international team of scientists			1
" truly enormous snakes really spark people 's imagination , but reality has exceeded the fantasies of @entity43 , " paleontologist @entity44 , who co-led the expedition , told reporters			0
" the snake that tried to eat @entity47 in the movie ' @entity49 ' was not as big as the one we found			0
" based on the snake 's size , the team was able to calculate that the mean annual temperature in equatorial @entity55 60 million years ago would have been about 91 degrees @entity56 , about 10 degrees warmer than today , @entity44 said			1
" @entity58 ecosystems of @entity55 were surprisingly different 60 million years ago , " said @entity44			1
" it was a rainforest , like today , but it was even hotter and the cold - blooded reptiles were all substantially larger			0
" the result was , among other things , the largest snakes the world has ever seen ... and hopefully ever will			0
" according to @entity66 , snakes are poikilotherms ( cold - blooded ) that , unlike humans , need heat from their environment to power their metabolism			0
therefore research suggests that at the time the region would have had to be no less than 86 to 93 degrees @entity56 for the snake to have survived			1
most large snakes today live in the tropical regions of @entity55 and south - east @entity78 , where the high temperatures allow them to grow to impressive sizes			0
meanwhile , @entity81 -- who was also part of the expedition -- said the tropical rainforest at @entity34 appeared to have thrived at these temperatures			0
" this data challenges the view that tropical vegetation lives near its climatic optimum , and it has profound implications in understanding the effect of current global warming on tropical plants , " he said .			0
