-- in the coming years , lifting the ban on women in combat , announced thursday by defense secretary @entity4 , might prove particularly challenging in the most iconic of military occupations -- the infantry , among the most physically demanding and tradition - bound branches of the @entity8 and the @entity9			1
determining the best path forward to integrate women into this elite group will require hard - nosed honesty , careful management and compelling leadership			2
for the 65 years that women have enjoyed a permanent place in the @entity21 military , they have been subject to restrictions			2
one rationale is the notion embedded in our culture that women should be shielded from great physical risks			2
another is a recognition of the physical superiority of the average male over the average female			0
a third is the fear that unit cohesion , critical to military performance , would suffer with the introduction of women			2
these three concerns apply to varying degrees in the infantry			2
but the last 11 years of war have clearly demonstrated that warfare is no longer waged in a linear fashion , and that the concept of " front line " no longer applies			1
opinion : a more equal military ? bring back draft historically , logistics operations were conducted " in the rear , " where risks were comparatively low			1
this has changed : in 2006 in @entity58 , for example , one in every five truck convoys was attacked			0
although infantry clearly remains one of the most dangerous military occupations , the proliferation of homemade bombs and other low - cost , lethal weaponry and tactics have heightened the risk of almost every occupation			2
war is more uniformly dangerous			0
that said , physical differences between the sexes remains a thorny issue			0
determining gender - neutral physical standards for an integrated infantry will be one of the most difficult tasks ahead			2
infantry soldiers and @entity8 are the primary forces for operations on foot			1
they not only travel long distances , but also frequently carry loads in excess of 50 pounds			0
both the short - and long - term health effects of such demands can be significant			0
single mom fought alongside combat troops in @entity89 the @entity90 has consistently pursued solutions to lighten the load , from exoskeletons to unmanned vehicles that would serve as " pack mules , " to the elusive quest for higher power , lower weight batteries			2
the success of these efforts will benefit both men and women			0
but until that happens , research into the effects these physical demands have on women is necessary before determining the degree to which they can , and should , be part of the full range of infantry			1
whether men serving in the infantry will accept women as peers is another open question			1
those who oppose women in the infantry argue that they would change group dynamics , disrupt bonding and ultimately harm unit cohesion			1
in the past , these fears have been brought up regarding the participation of minorities and homosexuals , too			0
but data show these negative predictions do n't come true			0
instead , successful integration has happened with strong leadership , and , critically , a process that is broadly perceived to be fair			0
opinion : women in combat a dangerous experiment even if the arguments underpinning the ban on women in combat have weakened , is there sufficient justification for change ? the @entity141 apparently believe so , as they have unanimously recommended the ban be lifted			1
each of the services already has been taking steps along these lines			0
this is in part driven by the evolution of the battlefield			0
when today 's senior leaders were serving time in @entity58 and @entity89 , they realized that the restrictions on women sometimes also restricted their missions			1
they implemented work - arounds and sought exceptions to policy			0
but they came home with firsthand experience of the mismatch between modern warfare and the policies limiting women 's role			1
women are in combat , and senior military leaders believe that future success demands they must remain available to be so , in even greater numbers			1
from the institutional viewpoint , there are also concerns that the traditional limitations fail to make the best use of women in the service			0
combat experience weighs heavily in promotion decisions , and restrictions have precluded women from gaining experiences equal to those of male counterparts			1
women are also excluded from many of the occupations disproportionately represented in senior leadership , and that automatically limits the number of women who can advance to the highest levels			1
at the same time , the pool of @entity21 eligible for military service is shrinking , and competition for high - quality recruits is intensifying			0
so it 's imperative that the military fully leverage the talent of the men and women it has and that it seeks to attract			1
by the numbers : women in the @entity21 military the arguments in favor of lifting the ban on women in combat outweigh those against it			1
despite defense secretary @entity4 's announcement on thursday , the military services maintain the prerogative to preclude women from serving in certain positions or occupations			1
@entity219 , or at least some specialties within that branch , could well be a case in which restrictions are warranted			0
but military leaders have time to evaluate this proposition , and to set the conditions to make any change stick			0
the path ahead may not be smooth , but it is necessary			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			1

@entity233 : @entity235 on women in combat has hurt operations , women 's promotion
leed : integrating women into the physically demanding infantry presents challenges
women are already in combat ; she says , the " front line " and " rear line " no longer exist
leed : research into women in infantry might show that some limits might be appropriate
