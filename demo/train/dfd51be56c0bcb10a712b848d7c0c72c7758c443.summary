-- a water - filled berm protecting a nuclear power plant in @entity3 from rising floodwaters collapsed sunday , according to a spokesman , who said the plant remains secure			1
some sort of machinery came in contact with the berm , puncturing it and causing the berm to deflate , said @entity13 , a spokesman for the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , which owns the @entity16 plant			1
the plant , located about 20 miles north of @entity17 , has been shut since april for refueling			1
" the plant is still protected			1
this was an additional , a secondary , level of protection that we had put up , " @entity13 said			0
" the plant remains protected to the level it would have been if the aqua berm had not been added			1
" parts of the grounds are already under water as the swollen @entity29 overflows its banks , including areas around some auxiliary buildings , @entity13 said			1
in addition to the berm , authorities have put in place floodgates and other barriers to help protect the facility , like sandbags			0
the 8 - foot - tall , water - filled berm , 16 feet wide at its base , surrounded the reactor containment structure and auxiliary buildings , according to the @entity44			1
" we built the plant up high enough based on history , based on the flooding in the past			2
if the flood would rise for some reason above that level we have taken precautions , again , per our procedures to sandbag the important equipment for the reactors , " said @entity50 , with the @entity51			0
he said the chances of floodwater getting into the building where the core is kept are almost zero			0
the plant is designed to withstand waters up to 1,014 feet above mean sea level , according to the @entity14			2
the river currently stands at 1,006.3 feet and is not expected to exceed 1,008 feet , the @entity14 said			0
heavy rainfall in @entity68 and @entity69 , combined with melting snow from the @entity71 , have sent the @entity29 surging downstream this summer			0
the river washed over and punched through levees in nearby northwestern @entity29 , spurring authorities to urge about 250 nearby residents to leave their homes			0
the 6 to 12 inches of rainfall in the upper @entity29 basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year 's worth , and runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140 % of normal , according to forecasters			0
it was catastrophic flooding from @entity84 's march 11 tsunami that knocked out cooling systems at the @entity87 nuclear power plant , resulting in three reactors melting down and producing the worst nuclear disaster since @entity90			2
this year 's @entity92 flooding has also led to a spate of rumors about the @entity16 plant that @entity14 and the @entity44 have been trying to knock down			1
the utility has set up a " flood rumor control " page to reassure the public that there has been no release of radioactivity from the plant			2
an electrical fire june 7 did knock out cooling to its spent fuel storage pool for about 90 minutes , but the coolant water did not reach a boiling point before backup pumps went into service , it has said			2
@entity0 's @entity110 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity16 plant remains secure , its owner says
some of the grounds are under water
the plant has been shut since april
