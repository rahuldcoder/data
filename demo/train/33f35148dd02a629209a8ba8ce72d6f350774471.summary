-- when the patrons of the @entity4 fought back after the @entity6 police raided that @entity8 gay bar 44 years ago , no one there imagined the federal government would ever recognize the rights of two women or two men to get married			1
no other movement for equality in the @entity15 has ever traveled so far or so quickly as the push for equality for gay men and women			1
i have a vivid memory of a dinner at @entity23 with @entity24 , an early leader of the gay rights movement , and @entity26 , then the mayor of @entity6 , sometime in the late ' 80s , when the idea of same - sex marriage was first in the air			1
" if you think people are going to go for this , you 're crazy ! " @entity26 said			0
i 'm sure i agreed with @entity26 at the time			0
as a gay man who came out the year after the @entity4 riots , i have witnessed more change than i had ever imagined would be possible in my own lifetime			1
when i was a reporter for the @entity38 in the 1970s , like every other gay employee there , i was securely in the closet			2
no gay person there believed his or her career could survive a disclosure about sexual orientation			2
opinion : fight for gay rights must continue in fact , in 1980 , there was exactly one openly gay reporter at a daily paper in @entity6 : @entity54 of the @entity55			2
by 1996 , more than 300 of @entity54 's colleagues at other mainstream media outlets had followed his example			0
that gives a small idea of how far and how quickly we have come			0
with wednesday 's two decisions from the @entity66 , one ordering the federal government to recognize same - sex marriages wherever they occur , the other reinstating marriage equality in @entity70 by letting a lower court ruling stand , the court 's five - member majority has placed itself firmly on the right side of history			1
this is the third historic gay rights decision written by justice @entity75			1
the first one was @entity77 , in 1996 , when the court threw out a @entity80 state constitutional amendment that had forbidden protection for gay people from discrimination			0
the second one was @entity85 , decided 10 years ago on wednesday , which outlawed every state statute that had criminalized same - sex love - making			1
the harbingers for wednesday 's decision were clearly in place in @entity75 's @entity80 opinion			1
in 1996 , he wrote , " a state can not ... deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws			0
" the @entity80 provision had singled out gay people as " a solitary class , " creating a legal disability so sweeping , it could only be explained " by animus			0
" on wednesday , @entity75 wrote that the @entity108 " writes inequality into the entire @entity15 code			1
" ... ( its ] ) principal effect is to identify a subset of state - sanctioned marriages and make them unequal			0
" the court called @entity108 an " unusual deviation from the tradition of recognizing and accepting the benefits and responsibilities that come with federal recognition of their marriages			0
this is strong evidence of a law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law			0
@entity108 's avowed purpose and practical effect are to impose a disadvantage , a separate status , and so a stigma upon all who enter into same - sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the states			1
" among other things , wednesday 's decision is a reminder of just how important the political process is to progress in @entity15			1
the first person nominated by @entity143 to fill what is now @entity75 's seat was @entity146			1
@entity146 was a fierce opponent of equal rights for gay people , and if the @entity149 in the @entity150 had not blocked his nomination , opening the way to @entity75 's appointment , none of these historic decisions might have been possible			1
opinion : how youth led change in public attitudes wednesday 's decisions also would likely not have happened without the election of @entity162 in 2008			1
as @entity163 , treasurer of the @entity164 , said wednesday , @entity165 repeatedly promised to appoint justices like @entity167 and @entity168 , both of whom were in the minority on @entity108			0
" so the vote would have been 6 to 3 against , instead of 5 to 4 in favor , " @entity163 said , without the votes of @entity162 appointees @entity175 and @entity176			2
@entity177 , director of the @entity179 's @entity178 , said , " one of the things that 's really important about the @entity108 decision is that it gets rid of the core of the last federal law that requires discrimination against gay people			2
the country used to have a lot of laws that required discrimination against gay people , " including an executive order signed by president @entity193 in 1953 that banned gay employees in the federal government and all its contractors ( an order that remained in effect until it was vacated in 1975 )			0
" until 1991 , federal immigration law actually barred gay people from entering the country , " @entity177 recalled			0
we still have a long way to go			0
while the @entity205 ruling makes @entity70 the 13th state to allow same - sex marriage , there are still 37 that do not			1
for more than 30 years , @entity209 has refused to pass a law that would make it illegal to fire someone because of his or her sexual orientation , and there is no chance that will change as long as @entity217 control the @entity218			2
bullying of gay children and gay teenagers also remains routine at elementary schools and high schools throughout the land			0
there is something bittersweet about a decision that expands the equality of gay people the day after the same court , including @entity75 , issued a horrendous decision gutting the @entity231 , perhaps the most important civil rights achievement of our time			1
this is especially true because the black civil rights movement provided all the blueprints that made the gay movement possible			2
opinion : the only history that counts for me is my own but wednesday is still a day for great celebration			0
on wednesday my country continued its journey toward fundamental fairness for people like me faster than any member of my generation ever thought it could			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			2

@entity252 : at @entity4 riot 44 years ago , no one would have imagined today 's ruling
he says the push for equality for gay men and women has made *incredibly* fast , recent progress
he says much of it *due* to political process ; boons of @entity75 appointment , @entity162 election
*kaiser* : still a long way to go on same - sex marriage equality , but there is cause for celebration
