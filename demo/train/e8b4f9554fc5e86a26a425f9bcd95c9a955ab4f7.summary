-- " @entity1 " had nothing to say -- and that was its genius			1
other groundbreaking series make a point of stressing their inventiveness , practically shouting , " look at me ! " " @entity1 , " on the other hand , blissfully took a @entity11 pole to sitcom conventions , with unsympathetic characters , defiantly provincial @entity15 interests and intricate plotting mechanisms -- and never called attention to itself			1
not that there 's anything wrong with that			2
in fact , there was so much right about the show that it eventually became tv 's no. 1 program and one of the most lauded sitcoms ever			1
in the 25 years since " @entity1 " premiered on july 5 , 1989 , as " @entity31 , " it has worked its way into pop culture -- its catchphrases still repeated , its plots still recounted , its shocking revelations about writer @entity37 and pitcher @entity38 still gasped about			1
but enough yada yada yada			2
here are five things that made nothing into everything : 1			2
no hugging , no learning			2
in general , pre- " @entity1 " sitcoms included heartwarming laughs , sympathetic " aws " and lessons learned			1
but there were no social niceties for @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			2
the quartet was so narcissistic that , when @entity51 's @entity56 , @entity57 , died after licking defective wedding invitation envelopes in the seventh season , @entity51 and the gang shrugged and continued with their lives			0
few sitcoms have dared to follow in its coldhearted footsteps , but there are exceptions , such as " it 's @entity68 in @entity69 , " " @entity70 " and " @entity1 " co-creator @entity72 's " @entity71			1
" ( @entity74 's @entity73 makes the point that " seinfeld " also paved the way for our recent bounty of coldhearted dramas			0
) the new , new tv golden age 2			2
pre- " @entity1 , " most sitcoms were classic cases of simplicity : one major plot , perhaps one minor plot , play them out in 22 minutes and turn on the applause sign			1
" @entity1 " sometimes had four plots -- one for each primary character -- and would put them together so @entity50 's girlfriend with the real breasts ( @entity91 ) would cross paths with @entity52 in a steam room			1
or aspiring hand model @entity51 would burn himself with the iron being used to smooth out @entity50 's puffy shirt			0
in those days , not many serialized dramas would dare attempt such plot juggling , never mind comedies			0
it 's still more the exception than the rule			0
" @entity1 " made the @entity103 the center of the sitcom universe			1
suddenly it seemed like half of @entity109 's schedule was making ends meet in @entity111 -- " friends , " " @entity113 , " " @entity114 , " " the @entity115 , " " @entity116 " -- while @entity117 and @entity118 added to the mix with such shows as " @entity121 , " " @entity122 " and " @entity123			0
" @entity15 was so prominent on ' 90s tv schedules that one @entity117 show , " it 's like , you know " ( created by " @entity1 " writer and producer @entity129 ) , made hay out of the concept of a @entity15 transplanted to @entity132			1
( incidentally , for all its @entity133 , " @entity1 " was shot at a studio in @entity132 ) 4			1
other sitcoms had been self - referential -- @entity138 and @entity139 regularly broke the fourth wall in their programs -- but @entity50 and his pals took meta - ness to a whole new level			1
season four , in fact , was literally about a show within a show as @entity50 and @entity51 pitched @entity109 " a show about nothing " called " @entity50 " that bore eerie similarities to " @entity1			1
" however , for all of " @entity1 's " quotation marks , it often used real people and brand names			1
there really is a @entity160 catalog , @entity15 's @entity162 baseball team really is the @entity163 and those are real cereal brands on @entity50 's shelf			0
however , @entity167 is still fictional -- we think			0
few shows have produced as many popular quotations as " @entity1			2
" you 're probably reciting them now : " no soup for you			0
" " master of your domain			0
" " look to the cookie			0
" you can leave more of them in the comments ... unless you 're a low - talker			0
in that case , you 'll have to speak up			0

@entity0 's @entity188 is no relation to occasional " @entity1 " writer @entity190 , though sometimes he wishes he was .			2
