-- for @entity2 , the @entity1 never ended			1
the music , memories and changes haunt his best songs and records like bittersweet perfume : vital , endlessly renewing inspirations that are also constant , enraging reminders of promises broken and ideals betrayed			0
in " @entity15 , " one of eight new songs sprawled across this turbulent two - @entity17 set , @entity2 recalls , in a brilliantly mixed metaphor , the first time he heard @entity20 's " like a @entity0 " : " poetry rolling off his tongue / like @entity24 chewing bubble gum			1
" and @entity2 tells you what he did with the impact			2
" i felt that magic and took it home / gave it a twist and made it mine , " he sings over @entity30 's rough - country swagger , as if the marvel of that time and his dreams are still close enough to touch			2
so are the mess and his dismay			0
psychedelic pill is @entity2 's second album of 2012 with the horse , his perfectly unpolished garage band of 43 years , and it has the roiling honesty and brutal exuberance of their best records together			1
this one opens with a special perversity : the thumping 27 - minute fuzz - box trance of " @entity51 ' back			0
" @entity2 , on lead guitar , spits feedback and throttles his whammy bar for long , mad stretches over rhythm guitarist @entity58 's trusty two - chord support and the rock - infantry march of bassist @entity60 and drummer @entity61			1
every six or so minutes , @entity2 's cracked yelp cuts through the tumult , spiking the flashback in the dreamy chorus with a contemporary disgust for tech - giant greed and the lousy sound of @entity69 , whose sh * * * y fidelity is " blockin ' out my anger / @entity73 ' out my thoughts			1
" there is , in fact , no mistaking @entity2 's mood			1
for most of its near - 90 minutes , @entity80 is an infuriated trip : long tracks of barbed - guitar jamming and often surrealistic ire ( " gon na get me a hip - hop haircut , " he sneers , to no apparent sense , in " @entity51 ' back " ) interrupted by short bursts of warming bliss			1
it is a weirdly compelling seesaw			0
" @entity80 " is a @entity92 - angel twist on " @entity93 " coated , in the first of two versions here , with jet - engine - like phasing			1
but then comes " @entity102 , " 17 minutes of broiling guitars and stressed a ection in which @entity2 examines a love that has somehow stayed alive long after the high times turned into routine and basic daily needs			1
even the sweet stuff is spiked			0
in the cheerful country funk of " born in @entity106 , " @entity2 admits he writes songs " to make sense of my inner rage			2
" yet he keeps finding hope in there			0
" me and some of my friends / we were going to save the world			0
. but then the weather changed			0
and it breaks my heart , " @entity2 confesses through black clouds of distortion in " @entity117 , " dogged by the mocking whistle of the horse			2
a big closing chunk of the song 's 16 minutes is @entity2 's idea of a giant marching through ruin : thunderclap drums and hacking - cough chords			1
but the real end hints at rebirth : a cleansing coda of wordless acid - choir sunshine			0
@entity2 may feel like the last hippie standing , but he still sounds like a guy who believes the dreaming is not done			2
