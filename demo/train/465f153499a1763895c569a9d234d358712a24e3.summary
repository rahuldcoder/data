-- @entity2 's essay on his decision to post his medical records on the internet in hopes of finding a crowd - sourced cure for his brain tumor has sparked a lively conversation on @entity0			1
readers raised a lot of thoughtful questions about his methods and what he was trying to accomplish , so @entity2 jumped into the comments to respond			1
many of the questions were too long to duplicate here , so we included excerpts and a link to the full comments			1
some questions and responses have been edited for clarity			1
you can read his full essay and participate in the discussion on @entity0 's opinion page			1
1 ) can this help a lot of people ? momza : his idea does not scale well			1
as long as he is the only one , he has a good chance that an idle doctor stumbles upon his files			2
if all the people publish their records , the chances will be extremely low			1
( read the full comment ) @entity2 : hello			1
yes , it does not scale if we start from the assumption that i 'm doing it for myself , and that what i 'm doing is to find the best doctor			2
but this is not the way i would want it to be			2
what i 'm really looking for is to suggest a vision in which this process happens and its results ( and the process itself ) is shared / shareable and replicated by everyone			2
imagine that the results of this remain accessible			2
if you , tomorrow , have to go through cancer , you will be able to benefit from all this work already done , with contacts , different strategies combined in critical , harmonious ways , documented testimonies , ways to access the various services etc. what i am also asking is to go beyond the idea of @entity75 , and to not limit this whole thing to an " administrative " or , even worse , " bureaucratic " process , because this is really harmful to people , both the " diseased " ones and the rest of the members of society			1
a " cure " should really confront with the whole human being			2
from what we 're understanding now , it would have benefits at multiple levels , including financial and technical ones ( and , obviously , at the level of health and well being ) 2 ) how do you pay for the treatment ? @entity95 : the one thing the guy does n't mention is insurance			2
... when average @entity100 get diagnosed , they have to think of how they can get effective treatment without losing their house because they have lousy insurance policies and @entity106 , none of which pay for the advanced treatments that can keep you alive			1
( read the full comment ) @entity2 : @entity112 , @entity95 , that is an incredible issue ! in @entity116 , for example , we have a very good welfare system for health			1
hospitals and infrastructures are not very good , but doctors are really excellent and many things are really covered by the national health system			2
so this can be a somewhat lesser problem for us			2
but as soon as you want to access something that is not " standard " ( even a simple blood test of a specific kind , to analyze the presence of cancer markers ) costs rise exponentially			2
this is another thing we 're confronting -- also trying to imagine ways to help people ( including me ) to integrate in the " cure " the possibility to raise money to actually perform it			1
3 ) ca n't advice from non-doctors do more harm than good ? @entity141 : please seek qualified , legitimate sources for your treatment			0
... while one may want to believe that " spiritual healers " or " artists " can contribute to your treatment , the truth is that they will not , and they may actually be harmful by distracting from legitimate treatments			0
( read the full comment ) @entity2 : @entity141 , actually " ordinary people " have been incredibly helpful , through their testimonies , experiences and evaluations			1
where clinical trials often are performed with as few as 30 people , i have been able to compare the documented testimonies of hundreds of people			1
and this is just one example of the ways in which this kind of process has been really helpful and productive			0
i wo n't even go , for now , into the enormous implications at a psychological , social and cultural level which i myself and many , many people are perceiving			1
but i do agree : if i eventually have to have a surgery performed , it will be by a professional doctor : ) 4 ) will opening the records do any good ? jamesrav : i 'd be interested to know how making it ' open ' actually benefited his condition versus keeping it ' closed '			1
i 'm thinking the specialist who gave him his results and options knew the very best that medicine could offer for what he has			0
( read the full comment ) @entity2 : great point			1
and that 's one thing i 'm really caring about : combining things in effective ways			1
to do this , i explicitly ask people ( doctors , researchers , regular people ... ) who contribute , to compare their approaches , also critically , and to try to understand how and if they should / could be combined , and to what extent			1
even in this scenario doubts remain , obviously			0
but at least you can benefit from a wider set of competences , technologies , strategies , philosophies and you can have an active role in the decisions which will affect your health			0
also because everyone involved will dedicate energies to make sure that they keep you informed and in the loop , making sure that you are actually able to understand what they 're talking about , the implications and side effects , the dangers and problems			0
5 ) can cancer treatment be crowd - sourced ? @entity218 : it would be wonderful if a crowd - sourcing site existed for cancer			2
options for treatment ( offered by physicians / treatment facilities ) could / should include research data on outcomes , side effects , and so on			0
this would greatly simplify a mystifying experience for many patients			0
@entity2 : this is one of the things we 're working on , with a lot of researchers and designers			1
something which goes beyond @entity75 , and looks at the whole story of people : emotional , lifestyle * and * medical , including data , imaging , history etc. and also taking into account the important issues of privacy and ethics of a thing of this kind -- really really important			1
we will publish a few things about this in just a bit			0
6 ) can the @entity254 make you a medical expert ? @entity257 : i wish him the best , but it 's dangerous to think that because you have access to a wealth of information on a particular subject , you are an expert at interpreting and applying the information			1
( read the full comment ) @entity2 : that is a good point , actually			1
and , in fact , i feel that i " have become an expert , " but through the possibility of accessing the knowledge and competences of people who have expertise on this subject , from a variety of points of view , and also by asking them , if they can , to speak , and confront , and compare , and criticize			2
7 ) should n't you just trust your doctors ? @entity281 : truth and knowledge are not democratic			0
trust your doctor over the @entity254			0
do what they say and get better soon			0
@entity2 : i do trust my doctors			1
and they trust each other , as well			0
so much that they are collaborating among ( themselves ) and with the other people as well			2
( they are ) also helping out to understand the best ways in which collaboration of this kind can take place with the least amount of possible risk , by filtering out useless and dangerous nonsense , and by working together to understand how to combine techniques and how to really * care * about the human being , in the process , by taking into account their lifestyle , their creativity , their engagement			0
... 8 ) is n't this just nonsense ? @entity313 : homeopathy does not and can not contribute to curing anything			0
and it 's not your " spirit " which needs healing			2
it 's your brain -- specifically that tumor -- which is a real thing in your real head			1
@entity2 : @entity324 , i hope you never have to deal with this kind of thing			1
but if you really speak ( and i mean really ) to someone who has , you will learn some incredible things			0
there are many , many approaches to confront this kind of problem			0
and most of the time they are inaccessible to you , either economically , technically , or even because you do n't know about them			0
@entity340 , like many complex things of our time , is not something for which a " truth " exists			0
many explanations are possible and available , as well as techniques to try and cure it			0
furthermore , many of them are compatible with each other			0
and , by combining them harmoniously , you have the chance to really send powerful messages to your body , working on immune system , cell multiplication and differentation , metabolism , etc. this is what , for me , is looking like the best possible option			0
for now it has proved effective			0
and , btw , i also do n't plan on excluding surgery at all			0
on the contrary : i wish to use every possible , positive , useful technique , as a combination			0
just like science says .			0
