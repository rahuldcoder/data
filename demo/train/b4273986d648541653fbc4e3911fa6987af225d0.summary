@entity10 , 24 , mumbled his name with his head down while appearing via video during saturday 's session at @entity2 's 36th @entity15 in @entity16			1
he is charged with disinterring dead bodies and arson in relation to the deaths of @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
he is a suspect in the killings of each of the four women , who were found dead on @entity16 's east side last december , a prosecutor said in court			1
but he has not yet been charged with murder			0
@entity16 police chief @entity32 later explained that one reason murder charges have n't been filed is that , while all the bodies were found in his city , the women were n't necessarily killed there			1
legally , a charge is filed in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred			0
" we have reason to believe that the deaths did not occur within the city of @entity16 proper , " @entity32 told reporters saturday			1
" anybody ( who ) thinks @entity16 is their dumping ground , they 're sadly mistaken			2
" @entity21 , 25 , and @entity22 , 24 , were found december 19 in the trunk of @entity22 ' @entity50			2
days later on christmas day , the bodies of @entity52 and @entity24 were located in the trunk of a car that had been set ablaze			0
at least three of the women placed advertisements dealing with " prearranged adult dating services " on @entity59 , @entity32 told reporters last december			2
the police chief called the ads -- where postings on the escort section cost $ 1 -- as " borderline prostitution			1
" a lawyer for @entity59 , @entity67 , said then that the company 's website did n't necessarily have anything to do with the women or their deaths			0
he insisted that investigators had seen " at least 30 different ( pertinent ) ads or other postings on at least 15 different websites , separate and distinct from ours			0
" around 6 a.m. tuesday , authorities arrested @entity10 and " another black male , age 32 " about 20 miles north of @entity16 in @entity78 , @entity2 , @entity16 police said in a statement saturday			1
the other man was later released , police said , but the @entity86 @entity85 decided to press charges against @entity10			2
he is being held on $ 1 million bond , according to police			1
even without murder charges being filed , some of the victims ' family members expressed satisfaction saturday that the case appears to be moving forward			0
" we 've been waiting for four months , and we 're just grateful , " @entity96 told @entity98 affiliate @entity97 , describing her daughter @entity22 and niece @entity21 as " good girls			0
" " we want justice , we want closure			0
" @entity104 ' uncle , @entity103 , said that he and other relatives hope that @entity10 's arrest will spur the investigation , including determining key details and whether others might have been involved			2
" hopefully , the house of cards will start falling now , " @entity103 told @entity97			0
" hopefully , we 'll get to the bottom of it , we 'll get to the murder part of this			0

@entity10 , 24 , is charged and held on $ 1 million bond in @entity2 , police say
the counts are tied to an investigation into the deaths of four women
they posted *online* ads for escort services before their deaths , police say
their bodies were found in @entity16 ; the police chief says they likely died elsewhere
