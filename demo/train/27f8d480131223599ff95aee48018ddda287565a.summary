-- two @entity3 passenger trains heading in opposite directions collided during rush hour friday evening in southwestern @entity6 , damaging both trains and leaving dozens injured -- some of them critically -- authorities said			1
a train heading from @entity11 to @entity12 derailed around 6:10 p.m. , hitting the other train in @entity14 , @entity6 , @entity3 spokeswoman @entity9 said			1
that caused some cars on the second train , which was destined for @entity11 , to likewise leave the tracks			1
gov. @entity19 told reporters friday night that five people were " critically injured , " one of whom was in " very critical condition			1
" two of the 26 people being treated at @entity27 are in critical condition , said spokesman @entity29			1
@entity31 , also in @entity14 , treated 41 patients from the incident , hospital spokeswoman @entity30 said			1
one of those was in serious condition and in intensive care , while the others mostly had minor injuries like " you might get in a car accident			0
" by 9:45 p.m. , 11 of the 67 who had gone to hospitals had been released			1
a passenger in a middle car of the @entity12 - bound train , @entity46 , recalled to @entity0 how his car went dark after the crash , then someone over the intercom " called all the doctors up front			2
" he and others aboard his " pretty full train " were evacuated , most of them physically fine if emotionally shaken			2
but there were signs of injuries outside , as @entity46 said he personally saw eight or nine ambulances and a number of wounded people on stretchers			2
@entity62 , who saw the wreckage , described the scene as " pretty graphic			0
" " i saw this one car and it was completely destroyed , and they were pulling people out of the car , " @entity62 said			2
" ... they were all bloody			0
" @entity71 was shut off along the line and service has been halted -- westbound past @entity14 , which is about 60 miles northeast of @entity12 on the @entity74 , and eastbound beyond @entity75 -- because of the derailment			2
@entity77 also announced early friday night that it had suspended all travel between @entity12 and @entity79 indefinitely after the crash			0
@entity14 mayor @entity81 said such travel headaches could persist for weeks , because the two tracks affected by the derailment -- which are both " shot right now " -- may take weeks to repair			1
because of a bridge replacement project , those two tracks are the only way in and out of @entity12 by train from that part of @entity6			0
workers will need to not only remove disabled trains , but also remove the tracks , regrade the rail bed , then lay down the tracks again , according to @entity95			0
" this is our pipeline to @entity12 , and it 's going to be shut down for some time , " the mayor said			0
" and it 's going to cost this region a great deal of money , frankly , not just to repair it but the lost wages and the lost economy			0
" officials from the @entity107 will head the investigation into the crash			1
@entity110 , a @entity111 - based spokesman for that agency , said a team should be on site by 9 a.m. saturday			1
" we have no reason to believe that it 's anything but an accident , " gov. @entity115 said			0
@entity0 's @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 contributed to this report .			0
