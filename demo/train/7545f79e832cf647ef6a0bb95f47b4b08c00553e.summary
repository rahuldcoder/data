-- when @entity2 ripped through the southern @entity4 city of @entity5 last weekend , it dumped in one day more than the city 's entire average rainfall for the month of december			1
according to the @entity10 , a total of 181 millimeters of rainfall was recorded in the area last friday , compared to the expected 99.9 millimeters for the whole month			0
the devastating flash floods , which have so far claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people , arrived just weeks after a report from the @entity17 's @entity16 indicated that global warming has significantly increased the number of people at risk from flooding			2
the report , " climate : observations , projections and impacts , " examined how climate change will modify the weather in 24 countries around the world			1
while findings vary from region to region , it forecasts an overall increase this century of coastal and river floods , extreme weather events and a global temperature rise of between 3 - @entity42 , if emissions are left unchecked			2
according to climate change experts , cities from @entity44 in the @entity45 to @entity46 in @entity47 are likely to be heavily affected			1
migration @entity50 , executive director of the @entity52 network , which promotes sustainable development among local city authorities around the world , says this could be a catalyst for migration into urban areas			1
" if the forecast temperature rise is accurate , then entire countries could be irrevocably damaged in certain parts of the world -- and their inhabitants will have to find somewhere else to live , " he said			0
to illustrate his point , @entity50 says that a third of flood - prone @entity47 , in @entity67 , could be made uninhabitable by a two - foot ( 60 cm ) rise in regional sea - levels			0
the @entity16 report echoes this point , predicting that climate change will subject an additional five million people in @entity47 to floods , if they continue to live in the same place			1
" where are they going to go ? " asks @entity50			0
" in most cases they 'll move to where the opportunities and the jobs are -- the nearest habitable city			2
" with 70 % of the world 's population expected to live in cities by 2050 , according to figures from the @entity91 , the impact of climate change on the urban environment appears more pressing than ever before			1
floods historically , cities built up around water highways and coastal regions have flourished due to their association with maritime trade and transport , said @entity99 , senior climate change analyst for the @entity101			1
" this means that a disproportionately high number of the world 's cities are located in areas that are now increasingly at risk of floods , " she added			2
according to @entity99 , recent risk studies from the @entity101 as well as the newly published data from the @entity16 report predict that extreme " once - in - a - lifetime " weather events such as flash floods and coastal hurricanes are going to become significantly more commonplace			1
but , she says , it 's not just cities in the developing world that are ill - equipped to manage the problem			0
" in @entity45 alone -- @entity44 , @entity120 , @entity121 -- these cities face terrible exposure to floods , and unlike cities such as @entity125 ( in the @entity126 ) -- they do not have the defenses to prevent them			0
" in the future , @entity99 believes that major cities will have to adapt to the reality of regular flooding by building new infrastructure , such as vast flood barriers and " evacuation avenues " -- wide roads with dedicated lanes for emergency vehicles			0
extreme heat global temperatures are projected to rise by between three to five degrees over the next century , according to the @entity16			0
dr @entity140 , senior researcher at the @entity141 , says that temperatures in the city will far exceed that , due to a phenomenon known as the " urban heat island effect			1
" " the built environment tends to absorb heat during the day and release it slowly at night , so there 's little opportunity for the city to cool down " he said			2
" this means that temperature rises from climate change will be significantly exaggerated in urban areas			1
" aside from increased instances of heat - related deaths , particularly among the elderly population , @entity140 says that the " wicked irony " of the urban heat island effect is that it stimulates a demand for air conditioning			1
" in places like @entity166 , we 're seeing a growing middle class use their wealth to pay for electricity - hungry air - conditioning units , which contribute to global warming , and this of course creates a negative feedback loop			0
" water shortages according to @entity140 , the predicted rise in global sea levels pose a threat to city aquifers -- underground wells that provide a source of fresh water for many urban settlements around the world			2
" in coastal cities , the rise causes ' saline intrusion ' -- where salty water gets into the fresh water aquifers , making it undrinkable " he says			0
in addition , dr @entity192 , executive director at @entity194 's @entity193 , anticipates that stock piles of bottled water will be have to be rationed when fresh water distribution systems buckle under the impact of city floods			1
" even in a developed city like @entity203 , which is very well protected by the @entity205 barrier , high intensity rainfall could create problems with the old sewage system -- causing the potential spread of microbial disease , " he said			0
adaptation @entity50 believes that urbanities of the future will be defined " not just by how they restrict their own contributions to climate change , but by the infrastructure and policies they employ to defend against the consequences of it			1
" to this end , @entity50 says that many of the cities in the @entity52 network have already started to implement adaptive measures			0
" in @entity227 , for instance , they have removed a highway and restored an ancient river running through the city			0
this creates a wind corridor to it keep cool , and will also help drain water away in times of high rainfall , " he said			0
meanwhile , @entity44 and @entity237 have led the way with green rooftops and urban gardens			0
" urban green spaces are going to be more critical than ( they have ) ever been , " he said			0
" not only do they absorb heat and rainfall -- helping to keep cities cool and dry , but they provide opportunities for small scale food cultivation -- so city dwellers can become a little less dependent on imports			2
" for @entity257 , economics professor at the @entity254 's @entity253 , the accelerated urbanization caused by climate change , will mean that for most cities , the only way is up			1
the professor , whose book " @entity262 " details how future cities could turn climate change to their advantage , says that he expects future modern cities to accommodate the flood of migrants by building energy efficient high - rise residential tower blocks , over small areas of land -- " much like we see in @entity274 today , " he said .			1
