-- while @entity4 carriers are facing turbulent times , some @entity2 airlines are hoping that a cut - price long - haul model will find a ready market in @entity2 's growing middle class			1
globally , low - cost carriers have been the industry 's success story over the past decade , with their market share rising from 8 % of all seats sold in 2001 to nearly 26 % this year , according to the @entity14			2
budget airlines have largely focused on short - to medium - haul routes , with their success in winning passengers through low fares forcing many full - service " legacy carriers " to launch their own low - cost options in response			1
efforts to apply the low - cost model to longer - haul travel -- most notably on trans - @entity28 routes -- have repeatedly met with failure , as witnessed in the collapse of @entity32 in 1982 , and @entity33 in 2008			1
but now , in @entity2 , an increasing number of operators are beginning to offer long - haul air travel for low fares , opening a new frontier in the fiercely competitive aviation market			1

@entity46 plans to fly to five destinations in @entity51 , @entity56 and @entity57 in its first year , before targeting other routes			2
@entity59 , a budget carrier from the @entity61 , will enter the market next year with a long - haul service targeting the @entity64 in the @entity65 and further afield			1
scoot ceo @entity66 told @entity0 's @entity67 that the low - cost market was rapidly growing in @entity2			1
" in eight years in @entity40 , it 's gone from nothing to about 25 % of @entity73 's ( @entity72 ) throughput			0
there 's a market that wants to travel no frills and wants to travel further afield			0
" @entity66 denied that @entity46 would simply cannibalize @entity45 ' existing customers , saying it was targeted to appeal to a separate , price - conscious customer base oriented towards leisure travel			0
" i believe there 's a whole market that does n't even consider some airlines because of their positioning in the market , because of the perceived expense of flying , and because of the bells and whistles that they might not want , " he said			2
but some have questioned the viability of low - cost long - haul as a business model			1
@entity46 's launch will come on the back of news that @entity48 is pulling out of its long - haul routes to @entity4 , after three years of flying into @entity97 and one year into @entity98			1
@entity48 ceo @entity99 told @entity100 that the decision was due to specific issues with the @entity4 market , rather than with the low - cost long - haul model itself			1
" that 's unfortunately the reality of where @entity4 is today , " he said			0
" what we 've seen over the second half of 2011 was that the number of @entity4 in our passengers were steadily declining as a reflection of the economic situation			0
people were more worried about jobs , and leisure travel becomes one of the first things that gets cut back			0
" @entity48 has subsequently announced it will suspend its services to @entity122 , @entity123 , from the end of may -- a decision it blamed on the spiralling cost of jet fuel			0
but @entity99 said the airline had proven low - cost long - haul worked in markets like @entity57 and @entity51			1
" i think there 's nothing structurally wrong with the model , " @entity99 added			0
" i think it can work			0
" @entity135 , managing partner of @entity136 , an advisory firm specializing in low - cost airline start - ups , agrees			2
he said @entity2 was a logical market for long - haul budget carriers to succeed , as a natural outgrowth of the low - cost short - haul carriers that had proliferated in the region in response to deregulation of the aviation industry			1
" you 've got an emerging and growing middle class in @entity2 , with increasing aspiration and ability to travel , " said @entity135			2
" it 's also an extremely price - conscious market			0
" he did not believe that the lack of service and legroom provided by budget airlines would necessarily be a fatal turn - off for customers facing a 10 - hour long - haul flight -- as long as the fares were low enough			1

free food on a flag carrier , or buy it yourself on a low - cost carrier ? it 's not an issue			2
most of us will have a bite to eat at the airport and can purchase something extra on board if necessary , " he said			0
" besides , in economy class on the flag carriers there 's not a lot of leg room to begin with			0
" @entity135 added that low - cost carriers could pack up to 25 % extra passenger seats in their aircraft , and also had a " big advantage " in not facing the substantial infrastructure costs borne by the legacy carriers , who were being forced to get into the low - cost sector themselves			2
" they 've realized if they do n't , they 're going to lose the market anyway , " he said			0
cannibalization need n't be a problem , according to @entity135			0
the success of a budget carrier like @entity50 in operating alongside its full - service counterpart @entity52 shows how the two brands could collaborate to serve different segments of the market without poaching each other 's customers			2
" all of us do n't drive a @entity207 and all of us do n't drive a @entity208 , " he said			0
he predicted that @entity2 's four budget long - haul carriers would all succeed in the market			1
and , in a prediction likely to be welcomed by travelers the world over , he said that other low - cost , long - haul carriers were likely to follow in @entity2 , and in other regions when market conditions were right			1
" i think we 're going to see a lot more low - cost long - haul coming into the market , " he said			1
" it 's only a matter of time			0

four budget airlines in @entity2 will be flying long - haul routes by 2013
*skeptics* doubt that the low - cost , long - haul model will work
but backers say the *formula* is already proving successful , and will spread elsewhere
