@entity0 -- for the first time in three years , @entity2 and @entity3 will come to the negotiating table in @entity6 on monday night			1
@entity8 secretary of state @entity7 reiterated praise for @entity2 prime minister @entity10 and @entity12 president @entity11 on monday morning			1
the talks will be " a difficult process , " but he added that the consequences of not trying could be worse			2
@entity7 said the goal is to seek " reasonable compromises " on " tough , complicated , emotional " and symbolic issues , then he announced former @entity8 ambassador to @entity2 , @entity21 , as @entity8 envoy to the talks			1
@entity24 understands that peace will not come easily , but that " there is now a path forward , and we must follow that path with urgency , " @entity7 added			2
the goal of the talks is to establish a @entity12 state with security arrangements and agreed - upon borders with @entity2			1
@entity21 said that he recalled a screen saver that his son once created for him -- a single question that ran across his monitor : " @entity39 , is there peace in the @entity42 yet ? " " for 15 years , i 've only been able to answer him , ' not yet , ' " @entity21 told reporters			2
but he said he is hoping that these talks would mark a change			0
president @entity47 said the talks are " a promising step forward " but " hard work and hard choices remain ahead			0
" in a precursor to the talks , @entity10 prodded the @entity2 government into approving the release of 104 @entity12 prisoners -- a move that flies in the face of popular sentiment in @entity2			1
" this moment is not easy for me			0
it is not easy for the ministers , " he said			0
" it is not easy especially for the families , the bereaved families , whose heart i understand			0
but there are moments in which tough decisions must be made for the good of the country , and this is one of those moments			0
" the measure passed 14 - 6 , with two abstentions			0
" it 's easy to see why @entity2 would n't be happy about this because some of these prisoners are murderers , " said @entity77 , an expert on @entity8 policy in the @entity42 with the @entity79			1
" there are some of them who 've thrown bombs onto buses			0
there are a lot of victims in @entity2 who are outraged and speaking out in media there asking , ' why do we have to give @entity3 some kind of concession to get them to the negotiating table ? ' they 're asking , ' why are we having to let people out of prison with blood on their hands ? ' " @entity77 wrote about the peace talks monday			1
defense minister @entity103 spoke in an internal @entity105 meeting sunday , saying : " there is a heavy price to pay about the freeing of prisoners , from the moral point of view , the legal point of view and deterrence			2
" i wish we would not have such dilemmas , " he continued			0
" however , in the situation which has come about , there will be a heavy price to pay if we decide not to go into a peace process and are blamed for that in our strategic connection with the @entity8 and other @entity121 countries			0
" also at sunday 's meeting , the @entity105 approved the opening of diplomatic negotiations with the @entity3 and authorized a team headed by @entity10 and four other top ministers to conduct the prisoner release			1
the votes were designed to build confidence and help kick - start the @entity2 - @entity12 negotiations			1
the first of four waves of releases is scheduled to come after the negotiations get under way			0
but @entity12 lawmaker @entity135 called the gesture too little , too late			2
" the number of prisoners who will be released will be 104 out of 4,800 @entity12 prisoners inside @entity2 prisons , so it is a very small number in comparison , " according to @entity135 , who said this group should have been set free after the @entity143 in 1993			1
" second , they will be released as announced by ( @entity2 justice minister tzipi ) livni in stages , depending on the attitude of the @entity12 negotiators on the table , which means the issue of @entity12 prisoners will be used as an instrument of political blackmail , " he said			1
" they were all arrested before the @entity156 agreement			0
they lost 20 and 30 years of their life , and there is no justification for that at all			0
" the players the @entity2 will be represented at the talks by @entity145 and @entity165 , and the @entity3 will be represented by chief negotiator @entity166 and @entity167 , @entity169 spokeswoman @entity168 said in a statement			1

but it 's not just in the hands of politicians			0
the @entity2 cabinet approved a measure stating that any agreement with the @entity3 will be submitted to @entity2 for a vote			1
and while leaders meet in @entity6 , violence raged in the region			2
@entity12 police in @entity190 , @entity191 , clashed with marchers protesting the negotiations			2
the protesters believe the talks indicate a " willingness to concede , against the position of the @entity12 national consensus and even the decisions of the @entity203 institutions themselves , " and called the planned talks " deeply dangerous to the @entity12 national cause , " said the @entity204 and @entity205 , a @entity0 - based @entity12 nongovernmental organization			2
