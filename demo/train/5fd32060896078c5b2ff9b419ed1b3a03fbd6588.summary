-- the mother of a missing @entity3 woman is suing the county of @entity5 and several sheriff 's officials for wrongful death and negligence in her daughter 's 2009 disappearance , court documents say			1
@entity13 , a 24 - year - old former beauty pageant contestant , was last seen leaving a @entity15 , @entity3 , sheriff 's station in the early morning hours of september 17			1
@entity13 had been arrested hours earlier after employees at @entity17 's , an upscale @entity15 restaurant , told police she refused to pay her $ 89 bill			1
at the restaurant , witnesses said @entity13 was exhibiting strange behavior including " sitting down with strangers and speaking in gibberish , " according to the lawsuit filed tuesday in @entity27 by @entity13 's mother , @entity28			1
a court has declared @entity13 dead , although no body has been found			2
@entity31 , the owner of the restaurant , told @entity0 in september that he called police because he feared for her safety			0
" it was not just the money , " @entity31 said			0
" something was wrong with her			0
and it was n't the alcohol , and we did n't know what to do and we did n't want to put her in a vehicle			0
" her family has said the college honors graduate suffered from mental health issues			1
