-- @entity2 's imminent return to @entity3 appears to be the worst - kept secret in world football -- and the @entity6 has already jumped the gun by announcing his reappointment before a deal has been done			1
the @entity6 's website published a story on sunday , dated monday , with the headline " @entity2 makes @entity3 return			1
" its subheader read : " @entity16 coach back at @entity17 after signing a xx - year contract			2
" the story was taken down , and the @entity6 issued a statement apologizing to @entity3 -- which is searching for a new manager following the departure of interim coach @entity23			1
" it was a publishing error			0
we took it down as soon as we were notified of it , and we 've spoken to and apologized to @entity3 , " it said			0
" we have no prior knowledge of any movement or any announcement			1
" @entity3 has made no comment			0
@entity2 's final game in charge of @entity33 was saturday 's 4 - 2 win over @entity35 , which left the @entity37 club in second place in @entity39 -- 15 points behind @entity41			1
the 50 - year - old did not talk to reporters after the match , though he did an interview with @entity37 television in which he denied omitting goalkeeper @entity47 and defender @entity48 -- with whom he has had public disputes -- and top scorer @entity50 for any other reason than they were not fit enough to play			0
last month he described this season as the worst in his career after losing the @entity56 final to @entity57 , meaning no trophy for @entity33 in 2012 - 13			0

@entity70 ! " @entity2 officially joined @entity3 on june 2 , 2004 -- the @entity6 website ran an archive feature on sunday -- and dubbed himself " the @entity73 " after having led @entity74 to the @entity76 title the previous season			1
he was unable to take @entity3 to the @entity79 final , but guided the club to two successive @entity6 titles -- its first @entity83 championship successes since 1955			1
after falling out with @entity3 's @entity85 owner @entity84 in 2007 , @entity2 joined @entity86 the following season and won two successive @entity90 @entity89 titles and the @entity79 in 2010			2
he was then courted by @entity33 with the goal of ending the club 's long wait for a record - extending 10th @entity76 title , but despite winning @entity39 in his second season @entity33 fell three times at the semifinal stage of the @entity79 and his relationship with key @entity37 players such as @entity47 deteriorated			0
as in @entity90 , he had a prickly time with the local press -- who took every opportunity to publish stories about dressing - room unrest at the @entity106			0
@entity33 announced last month that he would be leaving , despite having signed a contract extension until 2016			2
while @entity2 might have departed , the man who hired him will stay in charge of the club for the next few years			2
incumbent @entity112 was the only candidate put forward for @entity33 's presidential elections , it was announced sunday , and the 66 - year - old will be officially confirmed in the role on tuesday			1
@entity112 was first president from 2000 - 06 , a period when @entity33 last won the @entity79 , and returned three years later as he continued his policy of signing the world 's best players -- the so - called " @entity120			1

@entity6 apologizes to @entity3 after publishing a story about @entity2
