history has a cruel sense of humor			2
just watch president @entity3 struggle with a war in @entity5 and @entity6 during his final years in office ; watch him discuss what kind of @entity10 military he will hand over to the next president , and think back to the campaign promises that put him in office , a vow to end @entity17 's " dumb war " in @entity5			1
but it is more than that			2
like it or not , @entity3 's struggle with conflict in the @entity23 is a sign that foreign policy is set to emerge as a key issue in the 2016 presidential campaign			2
and , at least according to a new @entity0 / @entity29 , it 's an issue that the public feels the president is n't delivering on			1
but the reality is that the challenges are multiplying -- and there are no easy answers			2
from @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity37 , @entity38 and elsewhere on the globe , there are very real and very tough choices facing the next president			1
the most urgent ones , and by far the most complicated , come from the epicenter of instability , the smoldering @entity23			2
what is @entity17 to do ? it 's not just a rhetorical question			1
it is an extraordinarily important question for anyone who wants to become president of the @entity10			1
what would you do ? for voters , it represents a supreme duty to demand clear , consistent and credible answers and choose the man or woman who makes sense , who is not simply playing political or rhetorical games with something that means life or death for so many people			1
the @entity10 already tried " shock and awe , " the full - force , heavy footprint approach of president @entity66			2
and it has now tried the softer footprint approach from @entity3			2
now what ? is anyone really going to argue for a return to mass military force ? is anyone going to support a " stay the course " approach ? former secretary of state @entity76 , more hawkish than @entity3 , called years ago for arming moderate @entity6 rebels , but would that have meant @entity10 weaponry would have ultimately ended in @entity81 hands , as rebels have changed sides or lost to the ultra-radical islamists backing @entity81 or @entity85 ? sen. @entity86 has offered a confusing mix of isolationism and interventionism , blaming @entity10 interventions for the crisis while saying he supports the fight against @entity81			1
the @entity23 is unraveling and it 's very difficult to argue that @entity95 's policies have had much of a positive impact , either for the region or for @entity17			1
just last week , the @entity10 abandoned its embassy in @entity99			0
that makes for yet another country in the @entity23 with no @entity10 diplomatic presence , another failed state in the region , another former @entity10 ally out of power , another @entity108 ally gaining control of an @entity111 capital			0
on @entity113 , voters are usually more influenced by pocketbook issues than foreign policy questions			1
" it 's the economy , stupid , " has become every campaign consultant 's mantra			0
but the really tough , history - making choices will lie elsewhere			0
the next president will have to decide how @entity17 will fight @entity81 , and @entity85 , the rival terror groups who share an anti-modern , anti-western ideology backed by brutal terrorist tactics , which have already left thousands of dead @entity10 , including on @entity10 soil -- a reminder that simply ignoring the problem because it seems distant and intractable is not a viable option			1
the man or woman @entity130 will face a momentous decision on what to do about the war in @entity6 , where more than 200,000 people have already died and the killing continues			0
he or she will confront the reality that @entity10 civilians have been publicly slaughtered by @entity81 , an organization whose ranks keep growing ; already 20,000 foreign fighters have poured in to join @entity81 despite a bombing campaign led by the @entity10			1
the group 's radical ideology and vicious tactics have already started carving a scar of death across @entity147 and elsewhere			0
the suspect in last year 's shootings in @entity151 ' @entity150 had reportedly traveled to @entity6 to join @entity81 ; the man who shot up the kosher deli in @entity154 claimed allegiance to @entity81			1
the decisions will be complicated by the larger reality of the @entity6 conflict			0
four years after @entity3 declared " the time has come for [ @entity6 's dictator @entity161 ] to step aside , " @entity159 is massacring @entity6 civilians with barely a whiff of condemnation from an international community now more concerned with @entity81			1
@entity166 , the man whose forces @entity3 nearly bombed in 2013 , continues dropping barrel bombs on civilians while the @entity10 bombs his enemies , indirectly helping his cause			0
the next president will look at a map of the @entity23 , talk to @entity17 's @entity111 allies and hear their deepest concerns turning into reality			1
@entity111 governments have accused @entity108 of wanting to dominate the region			0
whether or not @entity3 reaches an agreement on @entity108 's nuclear program , there is no escaping the fact that @entity108 is making huge strategic inroads throughout the @entity23			0
when @entity188 @entity187 rebels toppled the @entity10 - allied government of @entity99 , on the border of @entity108 's traditional rival @entity192 , an @entity108 general reportedly declared the @entity187 ' success " a historic victory for the @entity195			0
" @entity108 's close partners , the @entity197 @entity188 militia @entity196 , turned the tide of battle in @entity6 , rushing in to save @entity108 's close friend @entity161			0
just a few weeks ago , an @entity108 general working in @entity6 was killed by an @entity203 strike on a @entity196 position just across the border from @entity203			0
what about @entity207 ? @entity208 has brazenly seized internationally recognized territory of @entity38 , a country whose leaders want closer ties to the @entity212			0
the most recent ceasefire , experience shows , is likely to be flouted by @entity208			0
what if @entity208 's advance continues ? should the @entity10 help arm @entity38 ? wo n't doing that inflame the situation , as some @entity147 leaders claim ? wo n't not doing that give a green light to @entity208 ? what if he pushed all the way to the @entity225 , members of @entity227			0
would the @entity10 go to war to defend @entity229 ? these are only a few urgent questions , but there are many others that look less pressing but are no less important			0
while the @entity10 and @entity147 busy themselves with international responsibilities , @entity234 is making major inroads in the developing world , notably in @entity17			1
is that something the @entity10 should worry about , something it should seek to counteract ? how actively should the @entity10 pivot to @entity241 and at what region 's expense ? how much weight should @entity95 give to human rights when its allies violate principles that are almost sacred to @entity10 ? what position should the @entity10 take regarding democracy , particularly in the @entity23 ? will the @entity10 back revolutions in the mold of the @entity252 even if they aim to topple regimes friendly with the @entity10 , if they might replace them with democratically elected @entity256 governments ? what about in @entity108 ? and how would it deal with the pro-democracy forces in @entity108 as the @entity212 negotiates with the @entity259 over its nuclear program ? and speaking of @entity108 , what would the next president do if he or she sees @entity108 dashing for a nuclear bomb ( with or without a nuclear agreement ) ? would they go to war , or allow @entity108 to become a nuclear - armed country ? these are all complicated matters , worthy of debate in front of the people who will decide who moves into the @entity275 after the @entity276 move out			1
the answer will -- and should -- play an important role in choosing the next president , even if experience has shown that , in the end , it is history that has the last laugh .			2
