-- for the first time , @entity2 maids working in @entity3 will be guaranteed a monthly wage , time off , and contact with their loved ones , under a new agreement signed by the @entity10 kingdom and @entity11 this week			1
human rights groups say the pact is a step towards ensuring the protection of foreign workers ' basic rights in @entity3			1
but it fails to address a worrying trend of domestic helpers filing complaints of exploitation and abuse only to face counter-allegations by their employers of " theft , witchcraft or adultery , " according to @entity28			2
the penalties for these crimes are harsh in the deeply conservative kingdom of @entity3 , which practices a puritanical form of @entity33			2
" there 's a real belief , and it 's something that can be prosecuted through the @entity3 courts , that black magic or witchcraft is real , " said @entity34 , senior researcher for women 's rights at @entity28			2
" domestic workers are especially vulnerable to these types of accusations because of cultural differences			1
" abuse of @entity47 migrants @entity34 , who spoke to domestic workers as part of a report on abuses against @entity47 migrants in @entity3 , says an amulet on a necklace may be enough for an employer to accuse a maid of plotting to bring bad luck on the family			1
earlier this month , @entity61 pardoned an @entity2 maid , who was on death row after being convicted in 2003 of " casting a magic spell on her employer and his family , " a spokesman for the @entity2 @entity60 told @entity3 news site , @entity71 news			1
she returned to her home in @entity73 , but others have n't been so lucky			0
some 41 other @entity2 workers face possible death sentences in @entity3 on charges ranging from black magic to stealing , adultery and murder , according to the @entity2 @entity81 and local non-profit groups			1
many facing charges claim they suffered long - term abuse or exploitation at the hands of employers , according to the @entity2 @entity81 's director for legal aid and protection of @entity2 nationals overseas , @entity92			1
" when i observe why they killed their employer , most of them were not mentally ready ( to work overseas ) , " @entity92 told @entity0			0
" they have to work unlimited hours , they have take care of the children , take care of the house , ( their salaries are ) unpaid , they can not go out , ( and ) they can not contact their families , " he said			0
no fair trial most have not been given a fair trial , said @entity107 , executive director of @entity2 group @entity108			2
" sometimes they do n't have access to interpreters or lawyers who make sure they understand the trial process , " @entity107 added			0
@entity107 's organization is campaigning for the release of @entity116 , a 40 - year - old maid who is on death row for murdering her employer and fleeing with @entity119 , 500 ( us $ 10,000 )			0
the woman reportedly admitted to killing her boss but said it was in self defense as her employer had been trying to attack her at the time			0
in cases like @entity131 's , it can be difficult to know exactly what happened , said @entity34 from @entity28 , since the alleged incidents often take place behind closed doors in employers ' homes			0
@entity34 said many domestic workers who are being overworked or are n't getting paid wo n't come forward because they fear the authorities will believe their employers , who are well - connected or at least speak flawless @entity138 , over a foreigner who may be unfamiliar with the language , local laws and her rights			1
' blood money ' @entity131 is due to be beheaded in the coming weeks , unless she can raise a hefty " blood money " payment to give to her employer 's heirs			0
@entity2 authorities have negotiated the amount down from sr10 million ( us $ 2.6 million ) to sr7 million ( us $ 1.8 million ) , according to @entity92			2
the maid 's 20 - year - old daughter , who was 11 when her mother left @entity2 , sent a letter to the employer 's family pleading for her release			0
so far , @entity158 million has been raised , including a sr3 million contribution from the @entity2 government along with other donations from @entity2 citizens and an unnamed @entity3 donor , @entity92 said			2
around 1.5 million women -- mostly from @entity2 , @entity165 , and the @entity166 -- work in @entity3 as domestic workers , according to @entity28			1
they make up less than a quarter of the kingdom 's eight million foreign workers but account for most of the complaints received by embassies of sending countries , the organization said			2
common complaints include wages not being paid , passports being seized , brutal work hours , and forced labor along with physical and sexual abuse			0
another 28 - year - old @entity2 on death row , @entity180 , allegedly killed her employer in 2010 when he attempted to rape her following months of sexual violence			0
workers freeze in 2011 , the beheading of @entity2 maid @entity186 by @entity3 sparked outrage in @entity2			1
@entity11 had been in the process of requesting a pardon for the 54 - year old , and was not informed prior to her execution			0
this seemed to be the last straw for @entity2 which announced it would put a freeze on sending new workers to @entity10 nation			2
@entity3 responded by suspending visas to @entity2 domestic workers			1
the ban has remained in place since , but disputes between foreign workers from other countries and their employers have continued to emerge			1
in one of the most high - profile cases , a @entity165 , @entity206 , 24 , was beheaded in january 2013 after being convicted of killing her employer 's baby when she was 17			0
at the time , @entity211 condemned the death and warned that " a disproportionate number of foreign nationals , mainly migrant workers from countries in the @entity217 , " had been executed in @entity3 over recent years			2
new rules six months later , @entity3 introduced new regulations that offered all foreign domestic workers basic protections including sick leave , work days of no longer than 15 hours , and paid vacation for one month every two years			1
the regulations also stipulated that domestic workers must respect the teachings of @entity33 , maintain her employer 's family secrets , and follow their employers ' " orders			2
" after more than two years of negotiation , @entity3 and @entity2 signed an agreement on wednesday that clarifies , for the first time , the duties and wages of workers and responsibilities of employers , explained @entity92			1
according to reports in @entity3 media , a statement from @entity3 's @entity242 said the pact aims to " strengthen relations between the two countries and moderate the relationship between employers and employees			2
" the ministry has signed similar agreements with three other countries that , combined , make up 70 % of @entity3 's domestic helper workforce , and has started new committees to look into foreign workers ' issues , the statement added			1
@entity0 reached out to @entity3 authorities for this story but have yet to receive a response			0
under the new agreement , @entity2 maids must have one day off a week , be allowed to keep their passports , to communicate with family and friends outside their employers ' homes , and receive health insurance			0
the agreement could lead to the ban being lifted , but @entity2 wants to see how it will be implemented before allowing more citizens to migrate to @entity3 , according to @entity92			1
he hopes the agreement will minimize the risk of @entity2 ending up on death row in @entity3 prisons by preparing the workers better while helping employers to understand the rights of workers in their homes			1
rights groups skeptical @entity2 must also ensure potential domestic workers receive medical check ups and do not have a criminal record , and setting up these systems will take time , @entity92 said			1
there must also be a shift in how some employers perceive their workers , he said			0
" we thank the destination countries because they have provided jobs			0
at the same time the user must be thankful for the workers , because they also will be assisted by the workers			0
" but human rights groups are skeptical that the 2013 regulations and the new pact with @entity2 will improve the lives of the workers any time soon			1
@entity34 from @entity28 said there are some advances in the pact , but it fails to tackle some of the root causes of what makes domestic workers so vulnerable , such as @entity3 's " kafala , " or sponsorship , system			1
" employers have so much control over their domestic worker by being their immigration sponsor			0
they have control over whether the domestic worker can change jobs ( and ) they have to give their approval before the domestic worker even leaves the country , " she said			0
" this system is the cause of such a huge power imbalance that leads to a lot of exploitation and that needs to change			0
