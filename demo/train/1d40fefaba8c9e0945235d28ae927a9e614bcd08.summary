@entity0 -- more than one million people in @entity4 are at risk of losing food , water and shelter in coming months , following the expulsion of international aid groups by @entity12 's government , the @entity0 ' chief humanitarian coordinator said tuesday			1

the statement by coordinator @entity18 comes after a joint @entity0 - @entity12 assessment of the situation			1
the information was gathered from march 11 - 18 in hopes of stemming further troubles in @entity4 after @entity12 's government expelled 13 international relief organizations from the wartorn region			1
the announcement came on the same day that president @entity27 , now an indicted war criminal , ignored the threat of arrest by traveling abroad to @entity31			1
also tuesday , a @entity12 staffer working for a @entity34 relief group was shot dead in @entity4			1
a full report of the assessment will be released soon , according to the @entity0 , but an executive summary and recommendations were made available on tuesday			2
" while a significant effort is being made by the government , by the @entity0 , by the @entity42 [ nongovernmental organizations ] which are left , to plug some of the immediate gaps in these areas , these are at the same time , ' @entity46 ' solutions , not long term solutions , " @entity18 said			0
the @entity0 estimates that 1.5 million people in @entity4 are dependent on healthcare support , 1.1 million need regular food aid , and another 1 million are in need of clean drinking water			1
the summary released tuesday said the @entity54 , which is still allowed to operate in @entity12 , is carrying out a one - time - only distribution program in march and april , but that new partners will be needed to continue delivering food after april			2
after the @entity59 charged @entity27 with war crimes and crimes against humanity on march 4 , @entity58 expelled 13 international aid agencies and revoked the permits of three organizations in the country			1
@entity27 -- the first sitting head of state to be charged with war crimes by the court -- has continued to say that humanitarian efforts in the country should be " sudanized			1
" " within a year , we do n't want to see any foreign aid group dealing with a @entity12 citizen , " he said at a rally a week after his arrest warrant was issued			2
@entity18 said that 13,000 to 14,000 aid workers in the region already were @entity12 nationals			2
@entity18 said the cooperation and technical help from the @entity12 government on the assessment was a good step forward			2
but he called it " only the first of many steps if the people in @entity4 are not going to suffer major consequences from these expulsions			0
" @entity12 's @entity0 ambassador , @entity88 , has repeatedly said he has information implicating the ousted organizations in activities contrary to their humanitarian missions			1
he has yet to make any of that information public			0
one claim is that some organizations acted as spies for the @entity59			0
@entity18 denied those allegations , saying they remain unfounded			0
" despite claims that there are dossiers of evidence , we have not been given any of that evidence , " he said			0
" in the absence of that , no meaningful investigation can be done			0
" the @entity109 aid organization , @entity108 , one of the agencies expelled from @entity12 , released a statement in response to tuesday 's findings			1
" current stop - gap measures will only be effective for a short time , " the statement said			0
" as the rainy season arrives within the next two months , people living in weak temporary shelters , in flood - prone locations where latrines can fill and overflow , will become at extreme risk of disease and death			0
" with the humanitarian capacity reduced by nearly 50 percent , responding to such emergency scenarios will be an enormous challenge for others to tackle , " @entity108 said .			0
