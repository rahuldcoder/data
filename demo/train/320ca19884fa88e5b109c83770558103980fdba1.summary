@entity2 's mother , like all parents , looked forward to the day when her baby could use words to tell her what was wrong			1
what hurts ? why are you sad ? by the time @entity2 turned 7 , @entity8 was still wondering if that day would ever come			1
her son had been diagnosed on the moderate - to - severe end of the autism spectrum as a toddler			1
he had ways of conveying his needs -- he 'd give @entity2 or her husband the remote control if he wanted to watch tv , or hand his mom her purse if he wanted to go out -- but there were so many things he could n't communicate			1
he " can not tell us if something hurts , why he is upset or happy , where he would like to go , what happened at school today , what he would like to do for his birthday , what he would like @entity31 to bring him for @entity32 , " @entity2 wrote on @entity22 in march 2012			1
the older he grew , the worse @entity2 's behavior was getting			1
he would fly into rages , which @entity2 believed were in part the result of his inability to effectively communicate his feelings and to understand what others were telling him			1
desperate for help , in april 2012 , @entity2 found a behavioral therapist who would change their family 's life			1
@entity2 turns 10 next month and is a totally different boy now , she said			1
" she knew that @entity2 had the ability to talk , " @entity2 said in a recent update			2
" she pushed @entity2 like none of us had before			2
" wherever they fall on the spectrum , people with autism often struggle with communication			1
they can have trouble developing language skills or fail to understand nonverbal communication through things like eye contact and facial expressions			1
parents , therapists and those with autism themselves described a gamut of communication techniques that have helped			1
besides working on actual talking , some have found success with picture card systems , sign language or printed words ; others speak through stuffed animals or video game characters			1
' learn to speak our language ' @entity78 , 26 , works as a speech - language pathologist in @entity80 , bridging the communication gap			1
most of the children she works with have @entity83 -- like herself			2
@entity84 was diagnosed with @entity85 at age 22 when she was in graduate school and still not making friends			2
she was always adept at using words , but was challenged by social communication			1
it was particularly hard in junior high			2
" girls are expected to know instinctively how to be social , and when they do n't , it is very obvious , " she said			2
for years , she thought of a conversation " as a contest to see who could say the most interesting thing			2
" she remembers one time when some girls were talking about @entity101 ; she jumped in with her own contribution , saying something like , " planes in @entity105 had synchronized guns so the gunmen did n't shoot their own propellers off			2
and they told her so			2
it got better when she moved to a big public high school , where students seemed more tolerant of differences			2
now she reminds herself to talk about what other people like , not just what she finds interesting			2
she said it helps to find an activity " that encourages communication but does n't force it			1
" for her , that 's dance class			2
" it 's reassuring to know that i will see familiar faces for an hour at the same time every week			2
i may socialize by starting a conversation about favorite dance moves , or i may exchange smiles with someone because we 're doing what we love			2
the more structured a social interaction is , the more comfortable it is			2
" to those without autism , said @entity84 , " everyone with autism has something to say			1
learn to speak our language , and we will learn to speak yours			1
" power of a pig @entity144 speech - language pathologist @entity142 agrees			1
as a certified autism specialist , she advises parents to use their child 's special interests -- animals , music , technology or cars , for instance -- to build their language			1
" go into their world and slowly lead them to yours , " she said			0
with students who love animals , @entity158 uses a potbellied pig named @entity161 to communicate			0
she has found many children feel comfortable talking with an animal and some have said their first words to @entity161			0
she tells the story of a junior high school student who desperately wanted friends			0
she rehearsed a few answers to " common pig questions " such as " what does he eat ? " and " how much does he weigh ? " then sent the young man into the school hallway with @entity176 on a leash			0
" it was not long before he was surrounded by other students , mostly girls , answering questions with a smile from ear to ear			0
a couple of the students remained friends , " she said			0
@entity158 's own son is on the autism spectrum			1
he is now 20 years old , goes to college and works with other special needs children			0
when he was younger , he and his mother would spend hours in the living room , lining up toy cars			0
" i kept the cars in a large bucket and if he wanted one he had to ask for it , " @entity158 said			0
" initially it was just ' car , ' then ' blue car , ' then ' shiny blue car , ' building language one car at a time			1
" more cookies ? it has taken about two years for @entity206 's son @entity205 to learn to use cards with pictures to communicate			1
the 8 - year - old has severe autism , and speaks about three to seven words a month			1
he ca n't tell his mother when he 's in pain , and she would give anything to have a conversation with him			0
but she celebrates that he is able to communicate about 30 food requests and 16 nonfood requests ( play , go outside , etc. ) through pictures			0
" i was tickled when @entity205 realized he had no limit to the amount of times he could request cookies			0
for the first time , i felt like a ' normal ' mother , because i had a child who was asking for something he wanted repeatedly , and he was getting the same answer ( ' no. ' ) , " @entity206 wrote in an e-mail			0
" it has been an amazing experience to see @entity205 go from just crying to using pointing to giving others picture cards on sentence strips			0
" @entity206 prays @entity205 will find the communication tools that work best for him , " and that he will be able to share his thoughts and emotions with those around him			1
until that day , i want the world to understand that my child is worth respecting , loving and cherishing			0
" talking at 9 @entity8 's son , @entity2 , knew about 50 words by the time he was 9 , but his main form of communication was taking his parents by the hand to what he wanted			1
a behavioral therapist near their @entity249 home helped @entity2 understand that their son was physically capable of speaking more , with practice			0
for the first six months , therapist @entity254 worked with @entity2 on sitting properly in his seat , keeping his hands folded on the table ( instead of hitting her ) and his feet in front of him ( instead of kicking her )			0
there was a close link between behavior and talking : as he learned how to stay calm , he was able to learn more ; as he became better at communicating , he grew more relaxed , @entity254 said			1
" if you have a student who 's hitting and screaming and kicking , you ca n't teach them anything			0
once you get them to a place where they 're ready to learn , then bam , you can do something , " said @entity254 , a board - certified behavior analyst			1
" his ability to learn was there			1
i think he figured out ' if i hit people , they probably will leave me alone			0
' " as they worked on identifying colors , numbers or letters , @entity254 would n't acknowledge his response as correct unless he said it verbally			0
@entity2 copied the model at home			0
" if he wanted any food items , if he wanted a particular tv show that he liked , if he wanted to go outside , he had to ask verbally or he did n't get his want , " @entity2 said			0
" quickly it was just easier for him to say the word than it was to throw a fit			0
" he can now verbally identify letters , colors , animals and some shapes , count up to 20 and say about 100 vocabulary words			0
he can answer simple questions and has gone from using single words to short sentences like , " i want rice cakes please , " or mostly complete sentences like , " i want swim at the beach			0
" " we went from being a family where our child was physically aggressive and having constant meltdowns to one that is enjoying experiencing the world through @entity2 's eyes			0
" he also has his own unique language , which his parents have come to appreciate , too			1
@entity2 loves to go for car rides			0
when he wants his mom to turn down a particular road , " he will put on his own turn signal			0
he clicks his tongue and makes it sound exactly like a car 's turn signal , and that is how i have known where he wants to go			0

autism comes with communication struggles
