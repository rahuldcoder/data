we did n't have one settler there			0
" the @entity32 still calls @entity2 " occupied , " although @entity32 secretary - general @entity33 last year balked at the question			1
@entity36 government web sites also describe @entity2 as " occupied			2
" @entity7 's supreme court ruled last year that after the disengagement , @entity7 " had no effective control over what occurred " inside @entity2 , according to the @entity7 @entity41			1
@entity7 's relationship to the two separate @entity16 territories -- @entity2 and the @entity44 -- is one of the most sensitive topics in the world			1
the issue is further complicated by the fact that @entity50 -- the @entity16 political party whose militant wing has killed @entity7 civilians through terrorist attacks -- and many other groups in the @entity57 consider all of @entity7 an occupation of what should be @entity60			1

@entity7 has " besieged @entity2 , " @entity15 said sunday			1
" they control the territorial waters , the airspace , the land crossing points and they gave themselves overriding security consideration or powers			0
" @entity7 says the steps it has taken are necessary to protect @entity7 citizens from terrorist attacks by @entity50 , which controls @entity16 life in @entity2			1
" they ca n't live without blaming the @entity7 for all the troubles of @entity2 , " @entity24 said			1
" @entity2 is a great place , it should be a very advanced place			0
