-- well , that worked			0
produced for only $ 5 million , @entity3 's " @entity2 " surpassed everyone 's expectations and opened to a staggering $ 54 million , according to studio estimates			1
that 's the biggest october debut ever , beating the $ 50.4 million opening of last year 's equally scary " @entity12 " @entity3 is also claiming that " @entity11 " clinched the best horror opening ever , topping " @entity10 " 's $ 40.7 million			1
but that record depends on how strictly one defines the horror genre			0
for instance , is " @entity16 " more of a sci - fi or horror film ? if you consider it to be the latter , then " @entity16 " holds the horror record with its $ 77.2 million debut			1
regardless , no matter how you look at it , " @entity11 " posted some huge numbers this weekend			1
the r - rated horror prequel secured the best opening since " @entity28 " premiered to $ 54.8 million in early august , and it essentially gave the box office a shot of adrenaline after two months of lackluster results			1
the series continued to attract a large proportion of younger moviegoers , with 53 percent of the audience under the age of 25			0
however , " @entity11 " skewed slightly older than " @entity38 , " which drew an audience that was 60 percent under age 25			1
surprisingly , " @entity11 " received a poor " c + " rating from @entity43 graders			2
horror films are frequently saddled with underwhelming grades from the market research firm , but by comparison , " @entity38 " earned a more respectable " b " rating			0
normally , " @entity11 " 's low @entity43 mark would foreshadow a significant drop next week			2
but considering that next weekend is @entity53 weekend , and there wo n't be a " @entity57 " movie ( or any other horror film ) to compete with it , " @entity11 " may actually hold up fairly well			1
like the house that always handed out raisins for @entity53 , the weekend 's two other new releases -- " @entity59 " and " @entity60 " -- attracted very few visitors			1
" @entity59 , " helmed by " @entity66 " director @entity65 , had to settle for fourth place with just $ 8.8 million			1
the @entity68 steampunk action film joined " what 's your number ? , " " @entity75 , " " @entity76 , " and " @entity71 " to become the fifth movie this year to open to less than $ 10 million while playing in at least 3,000 theaters			2
the movie failed to entice younger moviegoers , as only 36 percent of its audience was under the age of 25			0
@entity81 , who stars in " @entity59 " and is married to @entity65 , took to @entity82 to accuse distributor @entity83 of not properly marketing the film as a " fun family adventure			2
" the poorly reviewed movie garnered an okay " b " rating from @entity43 graders			0
even before reaching @entity92 shores , the @entity90 spy comedy sequel " @entity60 " had already surpassed its $ 45 million budget by grossing $ 85.1 million overseas			1
still , its $ 3.8 million opening ( and eighth - place finish ) this weekend is a disappointment , especially considering that the original " @entity60 " debuted to $ 9.1 million back in 2003			1
@entity43 participants gave the @entity68 - rated flick a " b " grade			0
second and third place went to holdovers " @entity103 " and " @entity104 , " which tallied $ 11.3 million and $ 10.9 million , respectively			1
both movies , along with " the @entity106 " in fifth place , dropped only about 30 percent from last week -- an indication of strong word of mouth			2
in semi-wide release , the g - rated basketball drama " @entity112 " opened to $ 1.1 million at 975 theaters , for a paltry per - location average of $ 1,090			2
among limited releases , two new movies stood out			0
the @entity119 thriller " @entity120 " collected a solid $ 582,000 from 56 locations			2
and the @entity123 drama " @entity126 , " featuring a breakout performance by @entity125 , grossed $ 138,000 from four theaters for a superb $ 34,500 per - location average			0
