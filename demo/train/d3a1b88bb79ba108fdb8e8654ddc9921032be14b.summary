@entity1 , @entity0 -- hair driers blast air and racks of clothing clatter past as organizers make their final preparations for a fashion show			2
some of the backstage bustle is downright comical			0
short @entity0 women , carefully wrapped up in trench - coats and brightly - colored @entity18 headscarves , struggle to help towering , leggy models from @entity13 and @entity14 countries change in and out of outfits			1
this is not your typical fashion show			2
the show is highlighting @entity18 women 's clothing -- even though very few of the models working here are @entity18			1
" listen , i 'm coming from @entity29 [ where ] we are always walking in shorts , t - shirts , flip - flops			2
not afraid to show it			0
but here it 's totally different , " said @entity35 , a model who stood more then six feet tall in a peach - colored lycra outfit that resembled a pair of long - sleeved pyjamas with blousy trousers			0
she later made a half - serious plea for help as a @entity0 woman slipped a two - piece " bonnet " over her head			0
the headpiece tightly covered @entity35 's hair , leaving only her neck and face exposed			0
nearby , a @entity53 - speaking model dressed in a sky - blue version of the same outfit whispered to a friend , " i look like a clown			0
" moments later , to the soundtrack of throbbing dance music , the women strutted across the stage dressed in an array of these pastel - colored costumes			2
the costumes are part of a swimsuit collection			0
known as @entity66 after the @entity0 company that manufactures them , the full - body suits are designed to let conservative women swim and exercise at the beach or pool without being too revealing			1
@entity74 , an export marketer for @entity66 , said the suits are exported to 35 countries			2
" @entity18 women are choosing these models , " he said holding up a sequin - embroidered lilac - colored full - body bathing suit			1
" especially the last five years , @entity18 women [ are ] really following fashion			1
" according to the manufacturers at this trade show , the @entity18 women 's fashion industry is growing and evolving			1
it also seems to be co-opting sales and marketing methods perfected in the secular fashion world			0
" ten years ago , most of the colors were black or grey , " says @entity90 of the @entity0 manufacturer @entity91			1
" now you can see everywhere pink , yellow , blue			0
" @entity90 said during the same time period his company had gone from manufacturing 10 different dress designs to more then 150			1
the designs on display here are a far cry from the black robes and all - concealing burqas many @entity105 associate with the @entity18 world			1
" the younger generation of @entity18 coming up , they want something stylish , " said @entity107 , a visiting @entity108 who works with the @entity111 - based company @entity110			1
" there 's nothing wrong with being beautiful , there 's nothing wrong with being classy , nothing wrong with being fashionable , nothing wrong with wearing the latest thing out there			0
as long as it 's modest , " @entity107 added			0
this relatively new industry may be growing , but it still appears to be dominated by men			0
most of the sales representatives manning booths at the trade show are male			0
she designs high - priced gowns studded with @entity132 crystals for conservative @entity18 women as well as their secular counterparts			1
" a covered person should not be scary , she should look nice , " @entity128 said			1
" we are trying very hard to get them to accept this			0
" @entity128 herself was dressed in a black trench - coat , with a lavender blouse , a brown paisley - patterned headscarf , and a gold watch studded with diamonds			2
one of the few @entity18 models hired to stride the catwalk here is @entity149 , a woman who wore a midriff revealing t - shirt as she did her make - up backstage			1
" in these clothes , you are feeling so clean , so pure , " she said , after changing into a blue - and - white striped full body @entity154 swim suit			1
asked whether she would wear a @entity66 to the beach this summer , she answered , with a laugh , " normally , i wear a bikini			2

@entity18 fashion shows off designs for fashion *conscious* , conservative @entity18 women
the @entity66 is a full - body suit designed to let women swim and without being too revealing
designer @entity128 : a covered person should not be scary , she should look nice
