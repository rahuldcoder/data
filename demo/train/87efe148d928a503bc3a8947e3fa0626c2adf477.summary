-- @entity2 footballer @entity1 had been looking forward to the new season			1
he was lining up for top division club @entity4 , and at just 19 had been identified by coaches as having a bright future in the game			1
but after just 15 minutes of the first match of the season , he injured his anterior cruciate ligament and his career as a footballer was over before it had really begun			1
now 30 , @entity1 does n't dwell on what might have been			1
instead he has spent much of the last 11 years moving from coaching to researching and writing books to unravel the enigma of talent and potential : what turns someone from just good to great ? " talent can not be evaluated in a vacuum , " he says			1
" you need to talk about what is important and then you can talk about what talent is			1
" for those in the field of sports the margins between being a gold medal winner are tiny			2
@entity1 cites the movement away from the gut - instinct of scouts -- " they only remember when they 're right " -- to measurable metrics , best shown in the 2011 @entity37 film " @entity38 , " as an industry - wide phenomenon aimed to find the very best			1
however , just pure number - crunching can be flawed if it is not done with clear goals and an element of objectivity , he suggests			1
" ( outside of sports ) the recruitment process has potential for becoming a lot more professional , " he says			2
" i think businesses are way too static , they look at resumes and certificates too much			2
" if you speak to a business you 'll have a hard time finding someone to explain why they are using the metrics they are using ; they basically put an ad in a newspaper because that 's what everyone else does			0
there 's a lot of ass - covering			0
" to find the best , you go to the place where it the most difficult to demonstrate the skills you are looking for , believes @entity1			1
as a consultant for a fashion company 's recruitment department he prescribed some bitter medicine : no resumes could be looked at and no one could come from within the fashion industry			0
the results , he says , were positive , with new employees coming from a range of backgrounds			0
others are looking to social media to help find the diamonds in the rough			1
former @entity86 and @entity87 employee @entity85 founded @entity88 last year			0
what began as a platform for @entity91 to help recruit future surf and skateboard champions via peer - evaluated competitions is now branching out into other fields			0
" we 're looking at how technology can help improve efficiencies , " says @entity85			0
" we 're moving into the enterprise space to help hire employees , like identify on - air talent for tv networks or a barista at a cafe ; they 're all applicable			1
" linked to @entity106 , @entity87 , @entity107 and @entity108 , the @entity91 campaigns invite skaters and surfers around the world to post videos of their skills and for others to rate them			0
a panel of coaches also chime in with their expert opinion			0
" there 's a filter layer , " says @entity85			0
" so votes from non-friends are weighted more than friends or those within the candidates ' social network			1
" it also gets fans involved and lets the recruiters see the personalities and who are the most marketable			0
" the @entity132 ski team used the platform last summer to try and help find members for its @entity136 aerial skiing team beyond its normal demographic			2
it encouraged gymnasts , trampolinists and tumblers to send in videos and be rewarded with a place in a try out camp			0
while it seems an ideal platform for finding the next surf champion or super fan to become a company spokesperson , @entity85 maintains that is not just an elaborate popularity contest or brand extending exercise			2
" you 'll still have to interview a potential ceo , but this provides a platform to filter , a pre-qualifier before some of the more traditional methods , " he says			2
" we 're creating a wider net that reduces the time to evaluate talent and gives people a chance to earn an opportunity			2
" ultimately seizing that opportunity comes down to the candidate , be it a potential @entity172 or gas pump attendant whose stellar service skills could be better used elsewhere			0
hard work is a necessity in being a top sportsperson , and @entity1 believes that fundamental holds true for success in other fields			1
" how many people get honest feedback or stretch themselves , set goals on a daily basis ? " asks @entity1			1
" not many of us			0
the whole practice mindset is what sports do very well , but not in business			0

@entity2 footballer @entity1 was forced to *abandon* his *dreams* of being a footballer after injury
*emerged* as coach , research and *author* on how to find talent
suggests employers need to be looking outside their industries , use *alternative* methods for hiring
*crowdsourcing* is an ideal method for recruiting unlikely top candidates
