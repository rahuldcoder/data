when @entity1 traveled into remote parts of @entity3 to find the birthplace of her grandparents , she knew it would be a life - changing journey			1
she could never have imagined how much			2
she met a professor who asked her to bring supplies to eight elderly @entity11 survivors in @entity12			1
soon after she crossed the border , she found herself in another world			2
" it was as if i 'd gone back in time 100 years			2
there were no cars , only horse - drawn wagons , little slanted huts , " @entity1 recalled			1
" it was something out of ' @entity22			1
' " @entity1 was appalled to find the survivors living alone in shacks , suffering in abject poverty			1
they often had to choose between buying food , medicine or paying for heat			2
back home in @entity31 , @entity1 was unable to forget them			1
" i do n't speak @entity34 , so i put a heart on a piece of paper , put a @entity39 star in it and put $ 20 bills in an envelope , " said the 65 - year - old television director			2
" i just wanted them to know i cared			2
" soon the survivors began writing back , sharing their stories from the war			2
using a translator , @entity1 began corresponding with them , and the professor sent her names of others in need			1
" suddenly there was a list -- 50 , 80 , 100 people , " she said			2
for seven years , @entity1 carried out this work with help from family and friends			1
in 2008 , she formed the @entity60 , a nonprofit that provides financial aid and friendship to 2,000 elderly @entity11 survivors throughout @entity3			1
the lingering impact of the war many of the @entity39 in @entity3 were not sent to concentration camps			1
their villages were instead targeted by @entity70 mobile units , which massacred thousands			2
to survive , people fled into the woods			0
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2014 @entity76 " as a child , i ran from the killing squads three times , " wrote @entity77 from @entity78			1
" even now , i still dream that i am running			0
" after the war , those who returned to their villages had little or no extended family left			0
many have not been able to get reparations intended for @entity11 survivors			1
now in their 80s and 90s , they find themselves struggling once again to survive			0
since 2001 , @entity1 said , she and her group have distributed more than $ 2.5 million in direct aid to members of what she has dubbed the " unluckiest generation			1
" some of them have endured multiple conflicts and have lost family members to @entity99 or were left penniless after the @entity100 disbanded			0
" but through it all , they have a great philosophy on life , " she said			0
" for them , holding a hand , sharing a moment , that means everything			0
" a lifeline of letters every one to two months , @entity112 sends at least $ 100 each to most of the people on her roster , along with a letter about her life			1
she has realized that the personal connection is something these people crave the most			0
" the money is lifesaving , but the letters are equally lifesaving , " said @entity1			1
" these people are living often without any parents , siblings , friends			0
" " your letter for me is like a little ray of sunshine in the darkness , " wrote @entity129 from @entity130			0
" i am no longer alone in my apartment			0
the letter with your photographs is on the table , " wrote @entity137 from @entity130			0
after the recession hit @entity143 in 2008 , survivors reiterated how much the letters meant			2
" i got so many letters that started with , ' we heard that your country is broke			0
if you ca n't send us any more money , we understand			0
just please keep writing , ' " @entity1 said			1
@entity112 receives more than 900 letters a year			1
each one is quickly read by a @entity34 speaker in her office			0
if it does not describe an urgent situation for the group to address , the letter gets e-mailed to volunteer translators			0
then @entity1 's return letter is translated into @entity34 and sent out with the funds			1
once or twice a year , @entity1 also visits some of the people she helps			1
" we have definitely created what i call a ' family of strangers , ' " she said			0
" i have all these grandparents praying for me			0
" @entity112 is desperate to preserve the survivors ' stories			1
she is working on a documentary about their experiences and hopes to donate her archive of nearly 10,000 letters to a museum or university			0
" they 've trusted me with their stories , so i need to make sure ( their stories ) live longer than i do , " she said			0
@entity1 mostly wants to help them live out their final days in dignity			1
" we can really write a more hopeful final chapter to the @entity11 , one of kindness and compassion , " she said			2
" what a way to give them what they finally deserve at the end of their lives			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity60 website at @entity197 and see how to help .			0
