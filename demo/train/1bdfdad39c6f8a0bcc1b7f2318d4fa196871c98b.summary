@entity0 -- ten years ago this week , under orders from gen. @entity4 , then @entity5 chief of staff , the black beret became standard gear in the @entity5			1
it was the start of a pitched battle within the @entity5 that would soon find itself fighting two hot wars			1
now , just shy of the anniversary , gen. @entity10 , the current @entity5 chief of staff , has replaced the black beret with the patrol cap as the default headgear for soldiers wearing @entity5 combat uniforms , what most of us would call their camouflage fatigues			1
a patrol cap is like a camouflage baseball cap with a flat top rather than a rounded crown ( think @entity24 circa 1979			1
) " it 's fantastic , " one soldier at the @entity26 said when @entity1 asked about the change			2
" awesome , " wrote a soldier on the @entity5 's official @entity31 page			1
" for years , soldiers have complained the wool beret was hot , hard to adjust and took two hands to put on			1
others said it looked out of place in combination with the uniform soldiers wore when doing their grubbiest work			0
but even before @entity4 's order , the idea of having the entire @entity5 wear berets was met with anger by the soldiers already wearing berets , like @entity47 , airborne troops and especially the @entity49			1
@entity47 , known better as the @entity50 , considered the beret as a symbol of their becoming members of an elite group of soldiers			2
as did airborne troops with their maroon berets and the @entity49 who had been wearing black berets since at least 1979			0
many of these elite soldiers felt that having every soldier wear a beret diminished the work and training they 'd gone through to earn their berets			1
" originally the black beret was a @entity71 tradition , " said @entity67 , president of the @entity68			1
" now i 've gotten used to the tan beret			0
" " my initial reaction to the decision to make the black beret the official headgear of the @entity5 was one of anger and disappointment , " retired army major @entity73 wrote in an official @entity5 internet post about the beret			1
at first , he tried to have the decision reversed before eventually getting on board			0
this latest change means the @entity47 and @entity87 troops will keep their green and maroon berets , and the @entity49 will stick with the tan berets that they switched to 10 years ago			0
if it strikes you that the @entity5 is spending a lot of time and money worrying about hats , well not so			2
first off , the @entity5 does n't wear hats , it wears headgear or covers			2
more importantly , the @entity5 says this move will soon save taxpayers about $ 6.5 million			2
the savings will come because most soldiers were being issued two berets and two patrol caps			0
now they 'll be issued just one beret and two patrol caps			0
the beret wo n't go away ; it will still be the standard head gear for soldiers wearing their @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , a dress uniform for more formal events			0
even some of those who opposed wearing the beret in the field posted on @entity31 that they liked keeping the beret for those occasions			0
" glad you 're still holding onto the beret for certain things , looks great with the @entity108 ! " one soldier posted .			0

the @entity5 's black beret is being replaced with the patrol cap
" @entity32 has prevailed , " says one soldier
some soldiers say the beret is hot , hard to adjust and takes two hands to put on
