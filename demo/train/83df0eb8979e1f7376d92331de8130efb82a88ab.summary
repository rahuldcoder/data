@entity0 -- @entity2 is a 12 - year - old boy without a country -- he 's a @entity4 citizen born in the city of @entity6			1
the @entity10 , in an unusual exception , will not allow his family to list " @entity15 " as the nation of birth on his @entity4 passport			1
the @entity16 will decide whether granting this " small " gesture on behalf of a child half a world away -- and others like him -- would disrupt the @entity24 administration 's ongoing efforts to secure a binding , lasting peace settlement for the troubled region			1
oral arguments in the separation of powers dispute are set for nov. 3			1
at issue is whether a federal law that explicitly directs the @entity10 how to record the birthplace of an @entity4 citizen on a passport impermissibly infringes on the president 's power to recognize a foreign sovereign			1
" there have been 50,000 @entity4 in the last 10 years that were born in @entity6 , and many of them would like to have ' @entity15 ' indicated as their place of birth in the passports , " said @entity38 , a @entity39 professor , and until recently a counselor on international law at the @entity10			1
" but this is also an extremely important geopolitical issue and a very sensitive foreign relations issue for the @entity4			1
" the high court case is @entity2 v. @entity51 , but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world , and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence : @entity6			1
its name translates as " @entity61 " to some and " @entity63 " to others			0
it is @entity15 's largest city and its capital , though that is not recognized by the @entity69 and most of the world community			1
divided into @entity6 ( populated mostly by @entity72 ) and @entity73 ( populated mostly by @entity74 ) , the city spans more than 48 square miles , with about 775,000 people			1
the terms " @entity77 " and " @entity73 " come layered with political , social , religious , and geographic questions -- amorphous , often misleading terms , symbolic of the larger struggle for control and recognition of all that this city represents			0
some use the terms " @entity74 " or " @entity86 " @entity6 to refer to the sections			1
the @entity88 is the heart of the region , a holy symbol to the three major @entity93 religions -- @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96			0
that tiny area -- just a third of one square mile -- contains the @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103			0
it is believed to have been first settled in the fourth millennium @entity105 , and according to the @entity108 , it was established as the capital of the @entity110 around 1000 @entity105 by @entity111			0
it has been destroyed twice -- and attacked , besieged , and captured more than a hundred times			0
canaanites , @entity115 , arabs , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , crusaders , @entity121 , and the @entity122 have all laid claim to the land			0
its status today remains one the thorniest issues blocking a comprehensive @entity129 peace agreement , with both the state of @entity15 and the @entity132 people claiming sovereignty			1
during the 1948 war , the western part of the city was annexed by the newly formed nation of @entity15 , and the eastern part annexed by @entity139			1
the eastern part was then captured by @entity15 during the 1967 @entity140			1
it considers @entity6 part of its " undivided capital , " but most of the international community deems the annexations illegal and a part of @entity132 land			2
the @entity15 government is based there , but no foreign embassies			2
the city is home to @entity153 and @entity154			0
the couple and their two oldest sons were born in the @entity4 , but the family migrated to @entity15 a decade ago , and in october 2002 the youngest , @entity159 was born			1
" we 're very proud of the fact that he was born in @entity15 and that we live in @entity15 and it 's the modern state of @entity15 , " @entity160 told @entity1			1
" religiously and historically , that 's very significant			0
" the father said his son -- who has been at the center of this legal fight for 11 of his 12 years -- frequently reminds his siblings he is the one @entity2 born in their current home			2
he is preparing for his @entity171			0
just three weeks before @entity2 was born , the @entity172 gave @entity4 citizens born in @entity6 the individual discretion to ask that @entity15 be listed on passports and consular reports , where it says " @entity177			1
" president @entity178 signed the bill , but issued an executive " signing statement " indicating he would not comply			0
the law , he said " impermissibly interferes with the president 's constitutional authority to conduct the nation 's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch			0
" so the @entity10 's official @entity187 still reads : " for a person born in @entity6 , write @entity189 as the place of birth in the passport			1
do not write @entity15 , @entity139 or @entity193 for a person born within the current municipal borders of @entity6			1
" it is not the first time the @entity172 and @entity198 have clashed over the region			0
the @entity4 embassy remains in @entity201 despite @entity4 lawmakers ' objections			2
the boy 's mother made the " @entity15 " request about two months after his birth , but embassy officials refused			1
his passport in fact shows his round , innocent face , and just " @entity6 " is listed as his place of birth			2
" that 's been the @entity10 's practice , the general rule for @entity4 citizens born abroad is that their passport lists only a country of birth , " said @entity215 , the @entity2 's lawyer			1
" so if a citizen is born for instance in @entity225 , it says @entity226			2
if they 're born in @entity201 or @entity229 , it says just @entity15			1
if you 're born in @entity6 , instead of saying the country , the city is listed -- just a city -- @entity6			1
" the attorneys for the @entity235 have framed their case as a modest request , one that does not implicate the president 's foreign policy power			2
they are asking the high court not to decide a political question , but simply tell the administration to enforce the law , for the sake of a little boy			2
" it is a very personal case			0
what 's at stake is their deep personal pride and sense of identification with the state of @entity15 , and their right , given by @entity172 , to express that , on the passport , " said @entity257 , who will again argue the family 's case before the high court			1
" that pride , and the national pride of others , is clearly what makes that region as much front page news as it often is			0
but i do n't think that this case itself is asking for any kind of broader determination than allowing these individuals that opportunity			2
" the government is thinking of the bigger picture			0
@entity10 officials would not comment on the record on a pending case , but president @entity24 has acknowledged the stalled peace process has created divisions both in that region and in the @entity4			1
" palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state ; @entity15 should know that their basic security concerns will be met , " he said in a may 2010 speech			2
" i know that these steps alone will not resolve this conflict			0
two wrenching and emotional issues remain : the future of @entity6 , and the fate of @entity132 refugees			2
but moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair , and that respects the rights and aspirations of @entity15 and @entity132			2
" the justices in 2012 had allowed the @entity304 's legal claim to proceed , and will now confront the larger questions : whether the congressional law steps on the president 's foreign policy power			0
" it 's one of those issues that people probably find remarkable that it has n't been addressed before , " @entity309 said			0
" because , presidents have been recognizing states and governments for 200 years			0
@entity172 generally has acquiesced in what the president has done			0
there has been very little conflict over the exercise of that power traditionally , other than in , for example , the @entity319 [ conflict with mainland @entity321 ] and , in particular , over @entity6			2
this is an issue that has been a festering source of tension between @entity172 and presidents for decades			0
" the family again plans to attend the court session in @entity0 next week			0
choosing a home , and being able to decide what to call it may seem like a fundamental right			0
but nothing is so easy when @entity6 is mentioned			2
the @entity235 say they recognize the geo - political complexity , but think in this case , in this judicial forum , the solution is simple			0
" whatever else they decide whatever else , the bigger issues , that 's for them to decide , " said @entity160			0
" what we request is just exactly what the lawsuit says , implement the law and write in the passport that my son was born in @entity15			1
" a ruling from the high court is expected in a few months .			0

boy is a @entity4 citizen born in @entity6
the @entity10 wo n't allow the use of ' @entity15 ' as a birthplace on @entity4 passports
the @entity16 will hear the case nov. 3
