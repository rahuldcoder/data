@entity0 does n't fit the stereotype of an eating disorder patient			1
she 's a 51 - year - old microbiologist and mother of two , not a troubled teen or 20 - something , yet for the past decade she has struggled with bulimia			2
@entity0 's problem began in 2002 , which was an eventful year for her			1
that march she was diagnosed with breast cancer , and in october , after a successful course of treatment , she was struck by a car in a crosswalk on her way home from work , sustaining multiple ankle and knee injuries that required surgery			1
she had always been slim and athletic , and exercise was her outlet for stress			0
sidelined with her injuries , @entity0 began sharply restricting her calorie intake so she would n't gain weight , and before long she was binging and purging			1
the cycle started to feel addictive ; it gave her much - needed pleasure and also eased her stress			2
" i was really angry about what was happening , and i did n't know any other way of getting rid of my anger , " says @entity0 , who lives in @entity31 , @entity32			1
@entity0 's case is hardly textbook			1
bulimia and anorexia tend to emerge during adolescence , not middle age , and the disorders are more prevalent among young people			2
@entity0 may not be as exceptional as she seems , however			1
in recent years , doctors and researchers have begun to look more closely at disordered eating in mid-life			2
despite the growing attention , experts say the problem is likely underreported , partly because adult women disguise behaviors such as purging , and partly because eating disorders typically are n't on the radar screen of doctors who care for this age group			1
" eating disorders are still in the closet to a large extent , especially for adult women , " says @entity57 , @entity58 , a clinical psychologist in private practice in @entity60 , @entity61 , who specializes in treating the disorders			1
" adult women have such shame about admitting it			1
" @entity69 : are eating disorders a form of substance abuse ? how eating disorders differ in mid-life full - fledged eating disorders are rare at any age , affecting fewer than 3 % of teenagers and 1 % of adults at any given time , according to government estimates			1
( an overwhelming majority of cases occur in women			0
) however , a smattering of data from around the world suggests the behaviors associated with bulimia and anorexia may be more common in mid-life than previously believed			0
the most recent evidence comes from a survey of 1,849 women age 50 and up , the results of which were published last week in the @entity95			0
eight percent of the respondents reported purging in the previous five years , and 7 % said their efforts to control their weight led them to exercise so much that it had begun to interfere with their daily functioning			0
the survey , which was conducted online , is n't a reliable gauge of how common these behaviors are among adult women in the general population			1
but the results do provide a glimpse into disordered eating in middle age that rings true with the growing anecdotal evidence , the researchers say			0
" my gut says this is pretty on - target , " says @entity113 , @entity58 , the lead researcher of the survey and the director of the eating disorders program at the @entity117 at @entity118			1
what 's driving these women to purge or work out excessively ? although the survey did n't examine this question in detail , a majority of the survey respondents said they felt dissatisfied with their bodies -- a hallmark of eating disorders across all age groups			1
indeed , previous research suggests that many of the factors that underlie eating disorders in young people may contribute to similar problems in older populations			1
according to a 2008 study in the @entity138 , the most common drivers include stress , depression , perfectionism , and social pressure to be thin , in addition to body dissatisfaction			0
@entity69 : how to help someone who 's depressed @entity0 's story is unusual in that most middle - aged women with eating disorders do not become ill for the first time as adults , @entity151			1
but there is some evidence that certain stressful experiences that are more common in middle age -- such as divorce , the death of a spouse , or medical scares like @entity0 's -- may help trigger , or reawaken , an eating disorder			1
weight gain and body changes related to aging likely play a role as well			0
as menopause approaches , metabolism slows and estrogen production drops , causing shifts in fat distribution that can lead to a thicker middle , even for women who are eating healthy and exercising regularly			2
most women gain eight to 10 pounds during the transition through menopause , which could aggravate any predispositions for disordered eating , @entity173 says			2
an epidemic of body dissatisfaction women like @entity0 who develop full - blown eating disorders may simply be the most extreme examples of a widespread fixation on body size among middle - aged women , @entity113 's survey suggests			1
more than 70 % of the women in the survey said they were currently trying to lose weight , and 62 % said they felt concerns about weight , shape , or eating had a negative impact on their life " occasionally " or " often			2
" forty - one percent said they scrutinized their body at least once a day -- by pinching their waist , for example			0
frustration with menopause - related weight gain , in particular , shone through in the answers to the survey 's open - ended questions , @entity113 says			0
" a lot of the women said , ' who stole my waist ? where did my waist go ? " @entity69 : tips for eating healthy during menopause @entity173 and @entity113 agree that the pressures adult women face at home , in the workplace , and in society are probably making matters worse			1
the changes associated with menopause are perfectly natural , but they are n't always easy to reconcile with catchphrases like " 30 is the new 50 " or the day - to - day demands of modern life			0
many middle - aged women are juggling child rearing and work responsibilities , or caring for aging patients			0
that can leave little time for planning healthy meals or exercising , at a stage of life when the amount ofexercise needed to maintain one 's weight -- let alone drop a few pounds -- goes up			0
" as a culture , we live in a very , very stressful time , and for women this is even more so , because our roles have changed so dramatically , " says @entity173 , coauthor of " @entity244 : adult women and the pressure to be @entity247			1
" " we have little time [ and ] few avenues with which to cope with the stress , and dieting and exercise abuse and weight loss are ritualistic ways for us to manage our stress			0
" the preoccupation with body size seen in the new survey can take a psychological toll even when it does n't develop into an eating disorder			1
many women who took the survey reported feeling distracted and preoccupied by their weight and shape as they went about their everyday tasks , @entity113 says			0
an often - overlooked problem eating disorders are hard on the body , especially over a long period of time			1
they can be fatal , and even in less dire cases they can lead to serious heart problems , digestive problems , tooth decay , and osteoporosis , which is already a major concern for postmenopausal women			0
" we 're actually more concerned about the physical consequences for women as they get older , because their bodies just do n't bounce back as well , " @entity113 says			2
" all of those systems start not being as robust as we get older			0
... add an eating disorder and the risk goes up			1
" @entity69 : when eating healthy turns obsessive the standard treatment for disordered eating typically includes psychotherapy , as well as counseling about nutrition and eating habits			0
women need to be proactive about seeking care , @entity173 says , since doctors -- and especially primary care physicians -- often overlook problematic eating behaviors in older women			2
" there 's really a lot of help available , but women have to find it , " @entity57 says			2
" it 's not going to come to them , unfortunately			0
" a good place to start , she adds , is the @entity310			0
@entity0 sought treatment in 2003			2
she recovered , but her life stresses snowballed : she failed to receive workers ' compensation for her accident injuries , and she wound up losing her job in a hospital lab. she started purging again , and she has cycled out of inpatient and outpatient treatment since then			0
@entity0 is currently in recovery , and going back to school to study public health			2
" i 'm excited about having a new career and having a new life , " she says			0
" that 's what recovery and therapy is all about , ... realizing and seeing that you 're more important than that number on the scale , or the number of wrinkles you have			0
you have more to give people than that superficial life			0
