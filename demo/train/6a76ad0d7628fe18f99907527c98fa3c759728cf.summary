-- should a convicted rapist , who has served their time in prison , be allowed to resume their old job ? what if that job was as a high - profile football player ? in the early hours of friday , @entity10 was released from a @entity12 prison -- a @entity14 facility for sex offenders -- after serving half of a five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old girl in a hotel room			1
a blacked - out silver @entity21 apparently whisked him out of sight of the waiting photographers before dawn had even broken			0
in another life , photographers had trained their lenses on the 25 - year - old @entity10 for very different reasons -- he was the prized player of third - flight @entity30 club @entity29 , signed for Â £ 3 million ( $ 4.8 million ) in 2009			1
three years later , that privileged existence came to an abrupt end after the @entity35 international striker was found guilty of rape -- a conviction he denies			2
he might have " done the time , " but not everyone believes @entity10 should be allowed to tie up his bootlaces and start scoring goals again , with almost 150,000 people signing a petition against his return to the @entity48 team			1
" a lot of the backlash has been over the fact that he 's not accepted his guilt , despite having served his sentence , " lawyer and @entity51 agent , @entity50 , told @entity0			0
" but where does it say that a convicted criminal , who has served their time , can not go out to work ? " role model ? as an elite football player earning the sort of money most people can only dream of , @entity10 does not have your average job			1
the deputy prime minister , @entity71 , who is also an mp in @entity72 , said @entity10 ' position as a role model for young boys needed to be taken into consideration by his future employers			2
" he has done his time , but i just do n't believe that the owners of a football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened , " @entity71 told @entity78			0
" you are taking on a role model , particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that , and he has committed a very serious crime			0
" club statement with the media furore increasing , @entity29 took the unusual step saturday of denying a report in an @entity95 newspaper that @entity10 has been offered a contract by them to play again			1
" an article in @entity101 today , that @entity29 has offered a contract to former player @entity10 is false and damaging to the club , " read a statement on its official website			1
" we have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about @entity10			2
" @entity114 , chief executive of charity women 's aid , asked what message would be sent out if @entity10 played for @entity29 again			1
" the club has a responsibility to look at who it is hiring in high - profile positions , and consider whether a convicted rapist , who continues to protest that he 's done nothing wrong and whose case has attracted widespread victim - blaming language , is someone that they want to be representing their brand , " she told @entity0			2
" it 's important that high profile institutions take a stand about the seriousness of rape as a crime , and do not in any way condone the blaming of victims of rape , or participate in a culture which trivializes violence against women			0
" playing fair ? @entity50 argued that much of the fury over @entity10 ' possible return to football was related to footballers ' relatively high earnings			1
" i think people are angry because normally a lot of the criminals who are sent to prison , once they 've served their sentence in relation to a heinous crime , have to start from scratch trying to get employment , " she explained			0
" but this is a young lad who has committed a crime , never admitted his guilt , and despite that , he comes out of prison and walks into a job which is so well paid			0
" @entity10 was never sacked by the @entity72 club , which instead allowed his contract to expire while he was in prison			1
so far , @entity10 has not revealed if he intends to return to football at all			1
though all eyes will be watching his next move closely			0
media scrutiny they will have to wait until next week , when @entity10 has promised to " make a very personal and profound statement by video , " on his website			2
" @entity173 [ @entity10 ' girlfriend ] and the family never asked for this media intrusion but it was thrust upon them following events of that night in @entity180 [ where the incident took place ] , coupled with an insatiable and hungry media society , " said @entity10 , referring to the northern @entity172 town			2
" all they have ever asked for is for the media to report fairly , help raise the concerns that there are from the vast section of society about @entity10 's conviction , and have a sensible debate			0
" he was n't the only one apparently tormented by the media , with @entity114 saying the victim 's life was made hell after being identified by @entity10 ' supporters			0
" not only was the original trial covered extensively in the media , but the victim was harassed and unlawfully identified by @entity10 ' supporters , and her life has been very badly affected , " she said			0
" he has shown no remorse , and his former employer -- @entity29 -- has not said anything to condemn the crime he committed			0
" what next ? @entity29 boss , @entity207 , has said only that he has had talks with club officials about the possibility of @entity10 returning , according to the @entity211			1
but as @entity50 argues : " if @entity29 do n't take him , what 's there to say another club wo n't sign him ? whether it 's in the @entity12 or abroad ? " what impact could his return have on their brand ? that 's something @entity29 is going to have to look into			1
" @entity221 may have left jail , but his conviction remains , and his future remains uncertain .			0
