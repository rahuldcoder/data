the crusade to find a home for a sacred electric guitar is reverberating like a thundering encore through the music business as innovator @entity7 's @entity6 from the ' 50s is going up for auction			1
the @entity12 - made instrument , called the @entity13 of guitars by some , is being sold by @entity16 , the late @entity7 's longtime friend , engineer , co-inventor and guitar tech. " this happens to be the first prototype of what we call the @entity6			1
it was sent to @entity7 in 1953 , 1954 , " @entity16 told @entity3 , holding the instrument with shiny pearly inlays on the guitar neck glinting back overhead lights			1
" this is the beginning of the proper @entity7 guitar			2
" @entity16 explains virtuoso @entity7 would hold notes on the guitar , sustaining a beautiful ringing that seemed to model in part a melodic @entity35 tone of the early 1950s			1
" and that 's what the kids loved , " @entity16 said and ran off some @entity7 guitar converts			1
" @entity40 was one of course			0
@entity42 of @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 of @entity47			0
" so many people love that bell - like sound , the sustain , that thickness of notes			0
they could turn this into a jazz guitar , a country guitar , a heavy rock guitar as well			0
" @entity16 , sitting on a wooden stool at the massive @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 , began picking away on the black guitar , a fluid sound that lured buzzing attendees to stop and listen			2
salesmen in $ 2,000 suits stood next to male rockers in $ 10 black t - shirts and eyeliner and mouthed over the music " that 's so bleepin ' cool			2
" " @entity7 brought this to me many times to be reworked , " @entity16 said			1
" and the last time he brought it to me he said , ' my @entity75 you should have this guitar			0
' " @entity7 , who is credited with many recording innovations , died in 2009			2
@entity16 is 72 , retiring and said because of its historical significance , he would like to see the guitar end up in a museum , such as the @entity82 in @entity83 or @entity84 in @entity85			1
@entity86 's will sell @entity6 and other instruments on february 19 at the @entity88 on @entity89 in @entity90 , also accepting bids on line and by telephone			1
@entity16 explains the guitar became showcased in the 1950s on 170 television shows , " @entity94 presents : @entity7 and @entity98			1
" black and white video clips show singer @entity98 and her husband doing classic songs such as " @entity102 " or their signature " @entity104			0
" " the guitar was great for television , very very showy , " @entity16 said			2
" and you could see @entity7 ' hands fly all over this neck because of the black background			0
" in music business lore , a great guitar tech is like a superstar mechanic for a race car driver			0
@entity16 and other guitar techs are often handed the beat up , broken , out - of - tune instruments and begged to get the old classic and running again by celebrity musicians			0
" when it came to difficulties where this guitar was n't coming back to well , he ( @entity7 ) would say ' bring it back @entity16 , do what you got to do to make it play , ' " @entity16 laughed			1
" when i was doing this work for him it was a great honor			0
here is my idol asking me to do work on his guitars			0
