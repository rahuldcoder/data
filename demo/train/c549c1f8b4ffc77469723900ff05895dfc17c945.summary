@entity0 is investing a chunk of his personal fortune to minimize the influence of the @entity4			2
the former @entity6 mayor pledged $ 50 million to his new group @entity7 for @entity8 , an umbrella organization for his two other gun control groups : @entity12 and @entity13 in @entity14			1
it aims to make the political climate more supportive of gun control			1
the new organization plans to compete against the @entity4 by adopting its playbook			2
the @entity4 has built an impressive and effective organization that touts millions of members , a robust lobbying organization and a massive campaign arm			0
" you 've got to work at it piece by piece , " @entity0 told the @entity24			0
in its grass - roots operation , @entity28 plans to increase its membership from 1.5 million to 2.5 million this year to implement its education and mobilization efforts			0
the group will focus on 15 states that have liberal gun laws , including @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
states that have advanced gun control initiatives will also receive attention , including @entity42 and @entity43			1
@entity0 says no , again , to 2016 " the @entity4 should be afraid , " said @entity44 , founder of @entity13			0
women , and more particularly mothers , will be the key demographic in the outreach to curb gun violence			1
" moms are afraid that our children will be taken away			1
in the end , that 's the emotion that 's going to win			0
" but influencing those in charge of writing gun policy will be the ultimate goal of the organization , which is also creating a political action committee to elect gun safety candidates to office and a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) , an @entity63 classification used to raise unlimited amounts of money to influence voters			1
it aims to motivate a million pro-gun safety voters to go to the polls in november			1
in addition , like the @entity4 , the organization will submit a gun safety questionnaire to candidates and keep a score card of how elected officials vote on gun - related issues			1
" if the candidate does n't support gun reform , we wo n't support you , " @entity44 said			1
with an infusion of cash from @entity83 , matching the @entity4 's financial heft will be a little less daunting			0
the @entity4 has spent more than $ 30 million lobbying elected officials since 1998			0
its efforts have been very successful in @entity87 over the past decade , defeating attempts to ban assault weapons and expand background checks			0
on the electioneering side of the influence game , the @entity4 's political action committee has spent nearly $ 150 million on campaigns since 1990			0
already in the first two months of this midterm election year , the powerful gun group raised $ 14 million , according to public data compiled by the @entity98			1
president of @entity28 , @entity100 , said the group 's 34,000 donors will also play a critical role in rivaling the @entity4			2
" i do n't want to lay blame anywhere , but it is a reality that the gun lobby has an incredible amount of political influence with members of @entity87 in @entity43 , " @entity104 , a prominent gun control advocate , told @entity106 in december			1
@entity104 's wife is former @entity14 rep. @entity114 , who was severely wounded in a shooting in @entity116 in 2011			0
" i mean , it 's very clear that many members take their cues on this issue from the gun lobby , " he said			2
the @entity4 has little to say about @entity83 's pledge , for now			0
" see you in @entity124 next week			0
we 'll have a lot more to say then , " spokesman @entity125 told @entity106			0
he was referring to the group 's annual conference , which takes place next week in @entity124			2
@entity83 's activism for gun safety increased after repeated mass shootings			1
his efforts to expand background checks after the massacre at @entity137 failed to pass either the @entity138 or the @entity139 , despite pressure from the @entity142 administration			0
the organization wants to expand background checks , keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers , crack down on gun trafficking and educate parents about the safe storage of guns .			2

the gun control group will focus on electing gun safety advocates to office
*everytown* for @entity8 will become the umbrella for other gun control groups
the effort will target 15 states
moms and voters are the key outreach demographic
