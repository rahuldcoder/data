-- the family of a @entity5 man who was the first to die in the 2001 anthrax attacks has reached a tentative settlement with the @entity9 government over his death , a lawyer for the family said monday			1
the family is waiting for word from the @entity13 before a deal is finalized , said @entity15 , the lawyer for the family of anthrax victim @entity17			1
the family sued the government for $ 50 million in 2003 , arguing that the military laboratory in @entity20 that was identified as the source of the bacterium should have had tighter security			1
" i think the family was vindicated that the government has agreed to settle the case with them in spite of the fact that they put up a lot of roadblocks , " @entity15 said			1
@entity17 and his wife , @entity32 , were married 27 years , and there is " still a hole in her life as far as her husband is concerned , " he said			1
@entity15 would not comment on any details of the tentative deal			0
@entity17 , a photo editor for supermarket - tabloid publisher @entity41 , died five days after testing positive for inhalation anthrax in october 2001			1
he was the first of five people killed in the anthrax mailings , with 17 other people sickened			1
" it 's a horrible , painful death , that they had to witness their loved one go through , " @entity15 said			0
" it 's something that they 'll never forget			0
" court documents filed last week in @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity5 , requested deadlines in the @entity17 lawsuit be suspended as the parties tried to finalize a settlement			2
@entity13 spokesman @entity59 declined to comment on any deal			0
" the documents speak for themselves , " @entity59 told @entity0 via e-mail			0
" we would have nothing further at this time			0
" the @entity65 eventually blamed the attacks on a civilian scientist at the @entity69 's biological research laboratory at @entity70 , @entity20			1
the suspect , microbiologist @entity72 , had a history of mental illness and killed himself in 2008 before investigators brought charges against him , federal prosecutors said			0
a february report by the @entity78 concluded that it could not reach a " definitive conclusion " about the source of the anthrax , which federal agents said had been linked to a sample from @entity72 ' laboratory			0
but the @entity65 and the @entity13 stand by their findings , saying that scientific testing gave agents " valuable investigative leads " that led them to @entity72			2
a @entity90 investigation in early october revealed that the federal government has spent $ 19 billion to fight biological attacks			2
multiple new labs have since opened to research potential treatments , and the government now counts nearly 15,000 workers , handling germs like @entity98 , plague , and anthrax -- about twice as many as before			2
the @entity65 now checks potential workers for felonies and ties to terror groups			2
but proposed reforms like psychological screening or requiring two people in labs have gone nowhere , with scientists who have reviewed the issue calling those proposals intrusive , expensive and impractical .			0
