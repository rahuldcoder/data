the home of @entity1 has a beautiful view of @entity3			1
it looks over a small valley with olive trees and grazing sheep			1
it also stinks here , the distinctive raw sewage smell of what 's known locally as " skunk water , " sprayed by @entity13 police as a riot - control measure			1
and when you walk down the road to the @entity1 family 's @entity18 home , you tread on the metal remains of tear gas canisters			1
on tuesday @entity22 and his cousin @entity23 walked into a synagogue in the @entity26 neighborhood of @entity27			1
armed with meat cleavers , they attacked the worshipers inside , hacking at them with the knives			1
they killed four rabbis and a police officer before they were shot dead at the scene			1
today @entity1 and @entity23 stare out at mourners from posters and flyers on the walls of the family home			1
here they are considered " shaheed , " or martyrs , of @entity13 's occupation			1
his 70 - year old father , @entity44 , was recovering from a heart operation when he saw the news of the synagogue attack on television			1
" i never thought my son would do something like this , " he tells us			1
he sits with us at the mourners ' tent erected near the family home			1
his eyes are red from crying and he ca n't stand for long stretches			2
we ask @entity44 what he believes triggered the gruesome attack			2
" maybe it was everything , " he says			2
but we do n't accept being pushed into a corner and treated like slaves			2
" in the hours that followed the attack , the @entity1 family says 15 relatives were arrested , some badly beaten in the process			2
they show us photos of the family 's ransacked homes and @entity1 's younger brother with a purple , swollen eye , blood streaming down his face			1
now , @entity1 's home will be demolished			2
the family show us the demolition order			2
his wife is distraught and unable to talk to anyone			2
her three children are being cared for by relatives			2
but perhaps the hardest part : their bodies may never be returned to the family			2
@entity13 says no decision has been made , but authorities here fear a family funeral could become a flashpoint , drawing hundreds to hold the cousins up as heroes			1
instead , police are considering burying the bodies in a municipal grave			2
the situation will not calm down unless they deliver the bodies home and allow us to bury them here " @entity44 says			2
" when they kill @entity110 the never demolish the house of @entity112			0
we never hear of a @entity112 home destroyed when they kill one of us			0
" @entity116 demolitions , the possibility of denied family burials : @entity13 is reviving policies it used during the intifada in the hopes of deterring future attacks			1
between 2000 and 2005 more than 650 @entity124 homes were demolished , displacing roughly 4,000 people , according to @entity13 rights organization @entity126			1
critics say these policies are ineffective , even counter-productive			0
but @entity13 's government insists that destroying homes may save lives			1
" it is an extraordinary step , one of the tools in our tool box , " @entity132 , the spokesman for @entity13 prime minister @entity133 , told @entity134			1
" a @entity124 terrorist , any terrorist , may not care about themselves			1
but maybe they care about their immediate loved ones and where they live			0
i 've been in security discussions and our experts believe this policy could save lives			1
" in the @entity18 neighborhood of @entity154 , @entity152 is one of those loved ones			0
her son rammed his car into a crowd at a tram station , killing a woman and a 3 - week - old baby			0
he was shot dead at the scene			0
now @entity152 picks through the rubble of what 's left of her home			0
" it is just for punishing us			0
that 's what it is , " she tells us			0
" how can destroying this house stop an attack ? " on the day we visit , @entity13 's public security minister , @entity174 , makes an unannounced visit to survey the destruction of @entity152 's home			1
@entity152 leans out over the remains of her son 's apartment wall to see @entity174 arrive			0
she watches without expression as riot police point up at the blown - out walls of the home			0
the neighborhood bristles with tension			0
riot police have blocked off the road and are checking residents ' ids and bags			0
police with rifles , stationed on rooftops , keep a watchful eye			0
@entity174 wo n't answer any of our questions and bodyguards block our approach			0
but he lets us film as he shakes hands with riot police and chats with them			0
for a moment , he seems to veer towards some nearby residents			0
one of his entourage offers a " @entity209 " as if to start a conversation with an older @entity124 resident leaning against a car			1
but the man turns his head and snubs the greeting			0
@entity174 and his staff quickly turn and drive away to another part of the neighborhood			0
throughout the visit , @entity174 never speaks to @entity152			0
if he did , this is what he would hear : " violence only creates more violence			0
adding more pressure only creates a bigger explosion			0

in the wake of several terror attacks , @entity13 revives policy of demolishing *perpetrators* ' homes
@entity13 says the policy may save lives by providing a *disincentive* to commit attacks
@entity124 say the demolitions are a *counterproductive* measure that will only make tensions worse
