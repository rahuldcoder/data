@entity0 -- potentially hundreds of @entity3 veterans and their family members who were laid to rest at @entity5 were misidentified or mislocated , including some in an area that includes grave sites from the wars in @entity9 and @entity10 , according to a new @entity12 investigation			1
the investigation culminated in a change in leadership at the historic cemetery that has been home to @entity3 veterans since 1864			2
" i deeply apologize to the families of the honored fallen resting in that hallowed ground , who may now question the care afforded to their loved ones , " secretary of the army @entity18 said			0

the investigation cited missing burial records , unmarked graves and burial urns put in a spillage pile , where dirt dug up for grave sites is left			1
investigators also said inaccurate burial maps are a " systemic problem , " which did not allow them to visit all the graves in question			2
@entity12 investigators found a " lack of established policies and procedures , a failure to automate records , and long - term systemic problems , " documents show			1
after reviewing the investigation , @entity18 made immediate changes but did not fire anyone			0
instead , he ordered punishments to the cemetery 's leadership			2
longtime superintendent @entity62 was reprimanded , and his deputy , @entity63 , was temporarily removed pending further review			1
the general in charge of the @entity12 investigation , lt. gen. @entity68 , said that two of the 211 mismarked graves were those of troops buried in the section reserved for those killed in @entity9 and @entity10			1

the other 209 or so were scattered among three other sites at the cemetery during an unknown period of time , @entity68 said			0
" i do n't know that there could be many more , but there could be more , " he said			0
with the cemetery holding more than 300,000 graves going back almost 150 years , the @entity12 admits it ca n't guarantee that all will be accounted for			1
@entity18 would not identify the names of the remains affected by the mismanagement			0
" while the inspector general 's team found that [ cemetery ] employees performed their jobs with dedication and to a high professional standard , they also found them hampered by dysfunctional management , the lack of established policy and procedures and an overall unhealthy organizational climate , " @entity18 said			0
" some 330,000 veterans and their family members are buried at the tree - covered and hilly @entity5 , @entity105 , site overlooking the nation 's capital			0

before thursday 's announcement , @entity62 had filed for retirement effective july 2			0
but @entity18 will not let him serve out his full duties , according to his letter of reprimand			1
@entity62 will be responsible for funeral operations until his retirement , and the cemetery 's management duties will be given to an interim superintendent			1
" given your decision to retire , i have elected not to initiate more severe disciplinary action , " @entity18 said in the letter of reprimand			2
@entity18 also created a position to oversee operations at @entity5 and will himself oversee the superintendent position			0
@entity62 's final duties will include ensuring a smooth transition for the person coming into this new position			0
while @entity62 is blamed for poor management , deputy @entity63 is being looked at for improper activities , including making false statements to @entity12 investigators , creating a hostile work environment , having unauthorized access to employee e-mails and signing a false document , according to @entity109 officials close to the case			1
according to a @entity109 official not authorized to speak publicly about the case , the @entity12 will ensure that @entity63 will not work at the cemetery			1
