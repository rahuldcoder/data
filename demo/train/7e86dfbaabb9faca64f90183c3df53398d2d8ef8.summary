-- oil companies could soon be using an innovative new technique involving nanotechnology and magnets to help clean up offshore oil spills			1
oil spills from container ships or offshore platforms are a frequent hazard to marine and coastal ecosystems and an expensive one to clean up			1
@entity11 expects the @entity13 oil spill in 2010 -- the worst environmental disaster in @entity16 history -- to cost it $ 40 billion			2
however , researchers from the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) say they have found a method of recovering oil after a spill using magnets , potentially saving companies like @entity11 money in clean up bills			1
on it 's own , oil is not magnetic , but @entity19 researchers say that when mixed with water - repellent nanoparticles that contain iron , the oil can be magnetically separated from the water			1
the nanoparticles can later be removed to enable the re-use of the oil			0
" i had known about other scientists using magnetic fluids to separate oil but it had never worked out practically and that was something i felt i could do something about , " says co-researcher @entity37			0
the recovery process would be conducted out at sea after the oil spill , explains @entity37			2
@entity48 polluted with oil would be pumped onto a boat treatment facility			0
once onboard , the magnetic nanoparticles would be added and attach themselves to the oil			0

" i think in the world we are in , there are always going to be spillages which affect the wildlife and livelihoods of people and this can help tackle that , " says @entity37			0
since the 2010 @entity13 oil spill , there has been a rise in interest from oil companies and government departments in funding new techniques for reducing the environmental impact and cost of future oil spills			1
until now the two main methods have been using chemical dispersants , which break up the oil , and skimming , a technique whereby the oil is pulled off the surface of the water			1
although there are drawbacks to both -- chemical dispersants can have negative impacts on marine life and skimming can be hampered by bad weather -- magnetic techniques may still find it difficult to gain acceptance			0
@entity37 admits that one oil company has already turned down the opportunity of funding the research but is confident that other companies will support the project			2
the use of tiny nanoparticles is seen by some as controversial			0
as well as being complex and difficult to use on a large - scale , there are concerns they could damage marine life , if accidentally released			0
see also : robotic sailboats built to clean up oil spills while their impact on the environment is still largely unknown , scientists such as @entity117 from the @entity16 - based @entity118 ( @entity118 ) , say their use should be limited			1
others suggest the magnetic technique would be better suited to small - scale use and that existing alternatives such as skimming are still better suited for tackling large - scale offshore oil spills			1
" on a small - scale it ( the magnetic technique ) may be an excellent system but i do n't think it will work at sea in such a challenging environment , " says dr @entity127 , founder of the @entity128			2
" i think ultimately , it may be a better way of recovering oil once it is brought ashore rather than out at sea			1
" for @entity138 , a newly developed skimmer from an @entity140 company @entity137 offers a better method for cleaning up oil spills			2
it can recover about 4,700 gallons per minute , so assuming the skimmer could be deployed 24 hours a day , it would take 30 days to pick up the entire 200 million gallons of oil spilled during the @entity13 disaster			0
" in my opinion , the new skimmers are the most hopeful and best method for cleaning up an oil spill and protecting health and the environment			0
they should be part of the safety equipment required by permit for every offshore drilling rig , " says @entity138 .			0

@entity19 researchers develop new technique for recovering oil using magnets
could save oil companies money and reduce costs of clean up
some experts *question* whether technique can work in sea conditions
skimming technique may be better suited to offshore spills
