if investment banker @entity1 wins @entity3 confirmation as a @entity4 under secretary , he 'll walk away with a parting payment of up to $ 21 million			1
talk about a win - win			0
the financial services firm @entity8 , where @entity1 is the global head of investment banking , has agreed to pay him about $ 16 million in unvested income early and give him between $ 1 million and $ 5 million in deferred compensation , according to financial disclosure records he filed with the government ethics office			1
the disclosures are likely to add fuel to the fire being stoked by liberal @entity20 who are bucking president @entity22 by opposing @entity1 ' nomination -- a charge led by @entity26 sen. @entity25			1
she argues in part that there are already too many " @entity31 executives dominating the @entity22 administration , as well as the @entity33 's , overall economic policymaking			1
" the practice of @entity31 executives cashing out early when they take government jobs drew criticism during last year 's confirmation hearings for the man who might be @entity1 ' new boss , treasury secretary @entity40			1
when @entity40 left @entity42 in 2008 and later joined the @entity43 , he made somewhere between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 in early stock payouts			2
deferred compensation and vested stock options were originally designed to keep talented employees from jumping ship			0
that 's left people like @entity51 of the @entity52 asking , " why are we paying these people to leave ? " " unless it 's just a backdoor way to pay off newly minted government regulators , " she added , " it 's hard to see how it 's in shareholders ' interest			2
" in fact , the practice led @entity52 president @entity63 to write to seven @entity31 players last month			2
in a letter to @entity1 ' firm , he wrote , " why is it in the interest of @entity8 to incentivize such departures ? surely @entity8 does not expect favorable government treatment from its former executives			1
" and that , of course , is exactly what critics fear			0
" the question is why would a company give an executive a special financial reward as they 're about to take a government position			2
some people say these policies encourage public service , but we worry that they give financial insiders even more sway over the government			2
in some ways , these companies are ensuring that they 'll have friends in high places , " said @entity88 of the @entity89 , a government watchdog group			0
@entity88 authored a report last year that found a number of major corporations financially reward employees who go through the revolving door			0
some @entity1 supporters say his appointment is n't a typical revolving door scenario because @entity8 is n't regulated by the recent @entity31 reforms aimed at reining in practices that led to the financial crisis			1
a @entity8 spokeswoman said @entity1 declined to comment and that the firm does not discuss compensation			1
earlier this week , the @entity109 ' @entity108 defended the practice writing , " would n't it be nice if all private sector businesses offered their employees the opportunity to pursue public service work ... without giving up income or other benefits that they may have earned ? of course it would be			0
well , that 's what the compensation policies of many of the firms in question do			0
frankly , it should be encouraged more broadly			0
" but to watchdogs like @entity88 these policies " show how the revolving door is literally written into the pay plans of big companies that already have an advantage over public interest groups when it comes to lobbying and making their voices heard			0
