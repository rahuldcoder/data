@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity5 wants to drop in on his neighbor , the best way to do so -- in fact , the only way to do so -- is to fire up his @entity8 and fly across the vast subtropical wetlands that he owns in this remote corner of northeastern @entity1			1
@entity5 and his wife @entity13 have dedicated their lives to land conservation in @entity1 and @entity16			1
i 'm along for the ride with @entity5 , and i must admit , i 'm nervous			1
not only is this six - seater the smallest airplane i 've ever been in , but it 's also windy outside -- and storm clouds are gathering			2
not to worry , my pilot assures me			2
" i 've been a pilot longer than you 've been alive , " says @entity5 , 66			1
during the flight we pass a thousand feet over the wetlands , and i watch the landscape change rapidly below : long , thin lagoons slice through thick fields of brown marsh			0
tiny floating islands sit engulfed by lush green prairies			0
with his keen eye , @entity5 spots a lone marsh deer , knee - deep in water , munching on grass			1
more than 350 bird species live in the wetlands , which is roughly the size of @entity43			0
" it 's a hotspot for biodiversity			0
it 's full of creatures			0
creatures flying in the air , and on the ground			0
so its conservation is important : to @entity1 and to the world , " he says			1
i traveled to the @entity0 -- which means ' shining water ' in the @entity58 language -- to profile @entity5 and his wife , @entity13 , for @entity61 's " @entity62 " series			1
we are highlighting " @entity67 " from around the world , and @entity5 and @entity65 certainly fit the bill			1
for the past twenty years they have dedicated their lives to land conservation in @entity1 and @entity16			1
their method is simple : buy up huge swaths of land , restore their eco-systems , slow development , and then donate the land to governments as national parks			1
wildlife philanthropy has existed in the @entity81 for more than a century , but here in @entity85 , this type of charity is not common -- and is even viewed with suspicion by some			0
" @entity85 does n't have a long tradition of conservation philanthropy			2
there have n't been a lot of people from the private sector that have said ' look , we 're willing to buy land and turn it back over to the government and make parklands ' -- but slowly it catches up , " he says			1
@entity5 made a fortune as the founder of @entity102 and @entity103 clothing companies			1
in 1990 , he cashed in his shares in @entity103 , making millions in the process			0
@entity13 soon followed suit , ending her 18 - year stint as ceo of the @entity111 outdoor clothing company			2
" the fashion business is not the business to be in if you 're trying to contribute to diminishing the impact on nature , " @entity5 says			1
through their @entity119 and @entity120 organizations , the @entity117 have purchased approximately 900,000 hectares in @entity1 and @entity16 , spending $ 275 million dollars of their own money in the process			1
they have already helped establish two national parks in the wind - swept @entity111 region : @entity1 's @entity125 and @entity16 's @entity126			1
they are hard at work on several other ambitious projects , including the @entity0 , which the @entity117 hope to one day turn into @entity1 's largest national park			2
" buying land , conserving it and shepherding it towards national park status , yes , it is probably legitimate to call us pioneers , " says @entity13 , 59			2
still , the @entity117 ' conservation work is not applauded by all			2
there has been fierce opposition to their efforts in both @entity1 and @entity16 by those weary of the growing presence of foreign landowners in @entity85			1
in addition to the @entity5 , clothing magnet @entity146 , actor @entity148 and @entity2 founder @entity149 also own huge areas of land in @entity1			1
as anti-american sentiment has grown here over the past decade , the @entity117 have been accused of many things			0
" there were really wild allegations that we were creating a jewish state , though we do n't happen to be @entity158			0
that we were creating a nuclear waste dump for the @entity81 that we were creating a passage for @entity1 to finally militarily overtake @entity16			1
all these things are society 's ways of beginning to accommodate new ideas , " says @entity13			0
just getting to the @entity0 is a challenge			0
my journey started with a 10 - hour , 700 - km overnight bus ride from my home in @entity170 to the small town of @entity172 in @entity173			0
from there , cameraman @entity174 and i drove two hours on a bumpy , red - dirt road to arrive at the @entity177 , the traditional @entity1 ranch that the @entity117 operate , and where guests from around the globe come to get up - close looks at rare species of capybara , caiman , deer and scores of birds			2
" we are trying to restore the place and bring back the species that were already extinct , like the anteater			0
and we are working with the @entity191 deer , which is a very endangered species			0
and perhaps in some years we will bring back the jaguar , that is our big dream , " says @entity192 , a wildlife biologist who heads the @entity119 's initiatives here			0
while the @entity117 are heroes in most environmental circles , some activists and political leaders have labeled @entity5 as arrogant , eccentric and out - of - touch with the pressing needs of humans			2
he told me that he does what he does because he feels the need to " pay rent " for living on planet earth			0
" the reality is that nature does n't care about human economies , or social justice or whatever problems exists within the realms of human beings			0
it 's just responding to impacts -- and we have to deal with those impacts one way or another , " he says			0
@entity117 ' way is to use his deep pockets to drive his even deeper commitment to conservation -- one hectare and one animal at a time .			2

@entity5 and @entity65 have dedicated their lives to land conservation
using money earned through clothing business to buy land under threat
they have purchased approx. 900,000 hectares in @entity1 and @entity16
some suspicious of their motivations , *conspiracy* theories abound
