@entity2 on the @entity1 , the jittery season is here			0
joint military exercises conducted by @entity5 and the @entity6 each spring start this week			1
the drills , involving thousands of troops and state of the art military hardware , do n't go down well with @entity10			1
it fired two short - range ballistic missiles into the @entity13 , also known as the @entity13 , on monday morning after slamming the exercises as " dangerous nuclear war drills for invading the @entity10			1
" " each year , @entity19 complains and demands a stop to these annual exercises , which it claims to be offensive in nature , " said @entity16 , a professor of @entity1 studies at @entity18			1
" @entity10 has complained vociferously at least over the past quarter century			2
" so what 's at stake ? we take a closer look at the drills and the tensions that surround them			0
the @entity6 and @entity5 stress that the exercises , named @entity32 and @entity33 , are defensive and non-provocative in nature			1
the @entity1 regime , however , does n't see it that way , and its state media has characterized the drills as rehearsals for an attack			0
leader @entity41 called for full combat readiness and oversaw military facilities , according to @entity44			0
" the @entity10 , being paranoid in their own way , have always had this concern : ' if there is going to be an invasion , this would be the time , ' " said @entity45 , executive director of the @entity46 , a group that advocates nuclear disarmament			2
" but that 's not the intent on the @entity6 - @entity5 side			1
" in march 2013 , the @entity55 went as far as claiming that the @entity6 was carrying out the drills with the aim " to mount a preemptive nuclear strike together with its @entity5 puppet forces			1
" playing up the threat also helps the @entity1 leadership 's propaganda efforts to control the population of the isolated nation , according to @entity45			1
as well as providing practice for the forces involved , the exercises send a message that the @entity6 " would defend @entity5 in the case of a @entity1 invasion , " said @entity71 , a visiting scholar at the @entity6 - @entity72 , part of @entity74			1
usually , with a lot of angry rhetoric and a series of weapons tests			0
near the start of the year , @entity10 typically demands the cancellation of the exercises			1
threats of doom and the firing of short - range rockets or missiles into the sea tend to become routine as the military exercises approach			1
that was underscored this year on february 8 when @entity10 fired five short - range missiles into the @entity13 , according to the @entity90			2
the barrage into the waters , also known as the @entity13 , came just a day after the @entity55 announced it had successfully tested a " cutting - edge " anti-ship missile			0
the @entity6 and @entity5 militaries announced tuesday that the exercises will run from march 2 to april 24			1
some furious statements from @entity10 followed , including a statement on @entity44 that the drills were a smokscreen to " to cover up their surprise invasion of the north			1
" @entity19 's outrage ignores the fact that its forces carry out their own drills each winter that analysts view as offensively minded			1
yes , amid nuclear negotiations with @entity19 in early and mid- 1990s , @entity108 held off on the drills several times			1
" there is precedent , we have done this before , " said @entity45			0
but he qualified that " circumstances have changed significantly since that period of time			0
" @entity10 has determinedly pressed on with its nuclear weapons program , thumbing its nose at the international outcry			2
it has carried out a series of underground tests and launching long - range rockets that could be used as intercontinental missiles			0
in january , @entity19 suggested it would halt nuclear tests if the @entity6 canceled the joint drills , drawing a sharp response from @entity127 , a @entity128 spokeswoman			1
" the offer , as i understand it , which we see as an implicit threat , is for the @entity6 to stop doing something that is routine , that is transparent , that is defensive in nature , and that is annual ... in exchange for the @entity10 not doing something that is prohibited under multiple @entity138 resolutions and that they are not supposed to be doing , " @entity127 said			1
" that 's really a false choice here			0
" the tone was set by @entity10 's long - range rocket test in december 2012 , followed by its third nuclear test two months later			2
the @entity145 responded with sanctions , and @entity19 continued to ramp up its threats of nuclear war against @entity5 and the @entity6			1
one north korean government website even uploaded a @entity151 video showing an imaginary missile attack on @entity108			0
the @entity6 decision to fly @entity155 stealth bombers , which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons , over the region only served to further antagonize @entity10 amid the annual military drills			1
" that was a really bad escalation of the tensions in the @entity1 , " @entity71 said of the period			0
but @entity19 's decisions to carry out the rocket launch and nuclear test were most likely carefully timed , according to @entity45 , who was part of @entity6 teams that negotiated with @entity10 under former president @entity167			1
" they game everything out			0
they do n't do things off the cuff for the most part , " he said of the @entity10			2
" if they 're going to do something very provocative , they have an extensive decision tree laying out many options			0
" the moves appeared to be aimed at advancing @entity10 's technology and making @entity41 , still a relatively new leader , look strong inside the country , @entity45 said			2
they also coincided with political transitions in @entity5 , @entity186 and @entity187			2
predicting the secretive @entity1 regime 's next move is a notoriously difficult game			0
last spring , its behavior was less provocative than in 2013 , although it did fire off a series of weapons that included medium - range ballistic missiles			0
@entity71 said that he did n't expect a new nuclear test or long - range missile launch this year , but that short - range missile firings could be a possibility			0
an escalation of rhetoric around the military exercises is also likely			1
@entity16 was less optimistic about the near future , saying that , if a major provocation takes place , " no one should be surprised			0
" " @entity10 has shown itself to be calculating and strategically minded , " he said			2
" there 's a political need to raise the stakes , there 's probably a technical need to test a long - range missile or a nuclear test -- it 's been a couple of years			0
" @entity45 said he was concerned that a miscalculation in an already sensitive area , like the disputed waters off the @entity1 's west coast , could lead to a rapid escalation of tensions			0
" there are a lot of things that can happen with a significant number of military assets around and on the peninsula , " he said			0
@entity41 is " similar in action but stronger in rhetoric " than his father , @entity71 said			0
" except that @entity10 under @entity41 has newer and more formidable weapons			2
" some of the techniques seen under @entity41 certainly recall those employed during his father 's rule			0
during the tensions in early 2013 , @entity10 declared that the armistice agreement that halted the @entity238 in 1953 was no longer valid			2
the announcement sounded unsettling , but @entity10 had already said in 2009 that its military was no longer bound by the armistice because @entity5 was joining a @entity6 - led anti-proliferation plan			1
in 2013 , the @entity244 also tried using the silent treatment , cutting off a military hotline with the @entity5			2
that was similar to an approach it had adopted in 2009 when it stopped responding to calls after the military exercises started			1
but during 14 years of @entity257 's rule , the @entity6 and @entity5 " had a track record of what @entity10 would do and a sense of what to expect , " @entity45 said			1
" @entity41 was new , you did n't know how far he would go , which added to the uncertainty			0

thousands of @entity6 and @entity5 troops are preparing to conduct their annual military drills
@entity10 views them as provocative despite carrying out its own military exercises
analysts believe @entity19 uses the " threat " from the drills for its own propaganda efforts at home
