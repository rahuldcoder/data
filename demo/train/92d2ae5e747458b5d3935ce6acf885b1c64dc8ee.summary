-- @entity1 was 382 pounds when a family doctor gave her four simple rules to lose weight : 1			1
eat 8 ounces of food every 3 hours 2			2
do not skip meals 4			2
do not tell anyone what you 're doing now 242 pounds lighter , @entity1 credits that last tip for helping her through the most difficult months of her weight loss journey			1
not having someone questioning every bite or trying to persuade her to relax on weekends helped her focus on the goal			2
" it 's so much better to walk into a room and have someone say , ' hey , did you do something different ? ' than to announce , ' i 'm on a diet , ' and have people pointing fingers at you , " she said			1
@entity27 and similar groups tout support as a major reason for their programs ' success , and studies have found that accountability is important in accomplishing a goal			1
but telling family , friends and @entity40 about your diet plans could have a detrimental effect , some experts say			1
@entity1 ' doctor , @entity44 , gives all of his weight loss patients the same rules			1
he blames the need for secrecy on the culture of obesity			2
since childhood , he says , we 've searched out people who look and act like us			1
" people who are obese live with obese people			1
most ( patients ) do n't recognize how bad a lifestyle they have , how self - defeating a lifestyle is			1
. they think that culture 's normal			2
" as human beings we have a difficult time with change , @entity61 continues			0
so when someone we love alters his or her lifestyle , we have a problem dealing with it -- even if that transformation is positive			0
" deliberately or not , the family , the friends , the other people who are part of that individual 's culture will resist the change , " @entity44 says			1
" ( they ) will try to change them back to what the culture tolerates			0
" @entity1 has discovered the truth in his theory			0
after she dropped a significant amount of weight , she could n't hide her diet anymore			1
that 's when friends started drifting away			0
" people are mean -- people who you would normally think would be supportive			2
one friend told me she liked it better when i was the fat friend			0
that hurt , " @entity1 said			0
there are other reasons to keep your weight loss plans to yourself			1
dr. @entity99 , a professor of psychology at @entity101 , studies how goals and plans affect cognition and behavior			1
in his research paper , " @entity111 , " @entity99 describes how spilling the beans -- and the resulting response -- can change someone 's actions			2
everyone has what @entity99 terms an " identity goal " of some kind , whether it 's to be a good mother or a better scientist			0
in the case of weight loss , that goal is to be a successful dieter			1
to reach an identity goal , you need indicators of your accomplishments			0
for a scientist it 's published research papers or a boss ' recognition			2
for a dieter it could be pounds dropped or praise from friends / family when they see how great you look			0
@entity99 's studies found that when you tell people what you intend to do , and that intention is acknowledged , the recognition qualifies as an indicator of accomplishment			2
" the danger is that you feel that you have already reached the goal and because of that you do n't have to act on it any more , " @entity99 says			0
in other words , when you tell a friend that you 're planning to drop 20 pounds and she notices your good intention , you no longer feel the need to follow through with exercise or healthy eating			0
there are a number of ways to avoid this phenomenon			0
" one is simple -- you can keep your mouth shut , " @entity99 says			0
" another one is to form different kinds of intentions , not only say what you want to do but also when , where and how you want to do it			0
" such planning helps create situational action control , he explains			0
when you find yourself at the gym before work , the situation you mentally mapped out controls your behavior instead of your intention to exercise more			0
the third way , @entity99 says , is to tell only one or two people who hold power over you ( metaphorically ) so that they help you stick to your intentions			2
select those people carefully , fitness and nutrition expert @entity175 warns			1
the author of " accountability is key " says people with negative energy or a trainer that does n't fit your style , wo n't help			1
but if you do find someone who will hold you responsible , share away			0
" tell them everything , " @entity175 says			0
" accountability is key because if you keep everything to yourself , no one is going to know what you 're doing -- no one is going to know if you fall off the wagon			1
" whether you choose to share your diet plans or keep them secret , it 's important to remember exactly who you 're losing weight for			1
" if you 're losing weight to please other people , your motivation will not be sustained to keep going when the going gets rough , " @entity175 says			1
and until you drop those extra pounds , you 're the only one who has to know .			0

dr. @entity44 tells all his weight - loss patients to keep their diet plans secret
research shows telling people your plans can have a detrimental effect
accountability is key , fitness expert says , but you have to pick your guides carefully
