-- who says we ca n't strike a balance between energy exploration and wildlife protection ? for years , a false either / or argument has stalled progress in @entity8 on energy development			1
but now we have a chance to both develop and protect one of our nation 's natural treasures			0
lying west of the @entity15 , and roughly the size of @entity17 , the nearly 23 million - acre @entity18 supports a stunning diversity and abundance of wildlife considered globally significant by scientists			1
the region also contains hundreds of millions of barrels of oil			2
given today 's polarized politics , is it possible to protect these lands while tapping their resources ? emphatically yes			0
for proof , look no farther than the august 13 announcement by @entity32 interior secretary @entity32 of a strategic plan that provides a responsible and equitable approach to managing the reserve			1
opinion : next global warming worry : thawing tundra the new guidelines would make 11.8 million acres -- roughly half the reserve -- available for oil and gas leasing , while protecting important wildlife and waterfowl habitat in the remaining half			1
as @entity32 said , the plan " will provide a road map to help facilitate the transition from leasing and cautious exploration to production and smart development " and " builds on efforts to help companies develop the infrastructure that 's needed to bring supplies online			1
" this plan is great news for the caribou , grizzly bears , wolves and dense populations of peregrine falcons , golden eagles and other nesting raptors that live and breed on these lands			1
the offshore and coastal areas also provide important habitats for seals , beluga whales and polar bears			1
the @entity73 area is one of the most important goose molting habitats in the circumpolar @entity15 , used by tens of thousands of @entity77 brant , white - fronted , snow and @entity80 geese			0
rare yellow - billed loons , spectacled eiders and millions of other migratory birds from the @entity77 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity87 flyways , and from as far away as @entity88 , journey each year to the wetlands , ponds , lakes , streams and rivers on the reserve 's coastal plain			2
the region has also sustained @entity18 native communities for thousands of years			1
the reserve was originally established by president @entity100 in 1923 when the @entity101 was converting its fleet from coal to oil , and has been managed by the @entity105 since 1976			2
opinion : why we should look to the arctic although this spectacular area was set aside as a " petroleum reserve , " the secretary of interior was given the legal authority and responsibility to ensure the protection of the environmental , fish and wildlife , and historical or scenic values there			2
about 1.5 million acres is already leased for oil and gas development			1
@entity32 has publicly committed to pursuing a policy of accelerated development by offering annual lease sales in the reserve , the next in november , while also protecting ecologically important and sensitive areas			2
beyond protecting these irreplaceable lands , this plan demonstrates that energy and environmental policy need not be in conflict			2
we see this balanced , responsible approach unfolding around the world , from the protection of the vast @entity80 boreal forest to the creation of the @entity137 marine reserve off the coast of @entity139 , both of which preserve critical but fragile resources while strengthening standards for sustainable use			0
but this way of thinking is not really new			0
it harkens back to president @entity149 's vision for sustainable and achievable conservation to protect the environment while still enjoying the economic benefits of our natural resources			0
the proposed @entity18 plan is an important step in the right direction for all @entity157 , including @entity18 natives , sportsmen and other conservationists who want to balance energy exploration with wildlife protection			1
but it 's not a done deal ; a final decision is expected in december			0
by dropping the old debate , @entity8 can demonstrate that a new era of compromise over conflict is possible			0
instead of either / or , this is a win - win			0
join us on @entity174 / @entity173			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

@entity179 , @entity180 : @entity18 has abundant wildlife and oil
new plan would open half the @entity18 reserve ( 11.8 million acres ) to oil , gas leasing
writers : wildlife such as caribou , bears , eagles , whales , polar bears would be protected
they say the plan balances energy exploration needs and conservation concerns
