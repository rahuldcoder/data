-- we first thought about starting this piece with the story of @entity4 , a survivor of @entity6 's 1971 war in which , some reports say , as many as 400,000 women were raped			1
@entity4 had been tied to a banana tree and repeatedly gang raped and burned with cigarettes for months until she was shot and left for dead in a pile of women			2
she did n't die , though , and was able to return home , ravaged and five months pregnant			2
when she got home she was branded a " slut			0
" we also thought of starting with the story of @entity18 , a woman in @entity19 who was forcibly held as a " bush wife " by the @entity21			0
repeated rape with objects destroyed her insides			2
her captors also made her kill her 1 - year - old daughter by smashing the baby 's head into a tree			0
we ran through a dozen other stories of women like @entity4 and @entity18 , and finally realized that it would be too difficult to find the right one -- the tale that would express exactly how and in what ways sexualized violence is being used as a weapon of war to devastate women and tear apart communities around the world , conflict by conflict , from @entity43 to the @entity44			1
it is because of this complexity that we must understand how sexualized violence is being used			1
we must understand in order to stop it -- just as , when seeking to defuse a bomb , it is crucial to know its components			0
both the @entity53 and the @entity54 have recognized that there is a lack of research on the nature and extent of sexualized violence in conflict , even as there is increasing demand from @entity54 bodies , donors , and others for better analysis to work toward prevention and healing			1
all of this is why we have begun a new project at the @entity72 that breaks down the specifics of sexualized violence into areas such as its motives and patterns , its fallout , and the gender and cultural attitudes that may have led to it			1
we 're calling our project @entity82 , because with four women being raped every five minutes in @entity44 alone , we can say it is nothing less than that -- an ongoing siege			2
and it 's time we began to put an end to it			0
sexualized violence may be the only form of violence in which the victim is blamed or is even said to have invited it			1
in war , rape shames women , men , children , entire societies			1
the stigma imposed on all who are touched by this violence makes this weapon incredibly effective as a means of destroying the enemy			0
but it is crucial to remember that it was n't always like this , nor does it have to be			2
sexualized violence is n't a " natural " part of conflict			1
for the first 90 % or more of human history , females and males had roles that were balanced and porous			0
our societal positions were n't based on the domination of females by males			0
humans and nature , women and men , were linked rather than ranked			0
the circle , not the hierarchy , was the organizing principle of our thinking			0
by analyzing how sexualized violence was used to ethnically cleanse , as it was in @entity126 ; to force pregnancies that would literally change the face of the next generation ; or , as in @entity130 , to stop dissent , we can look to future wars and possibly prevent a reoccurrence			1
for generations , we have ignored or been denied knowledge of the mass sexualized violence inflicted on @entity138 women in the @entity139			1
women who survived brutal attacks have even been accused of collaborating in order to survive , just as , say , a raped woman in the @entity44 may never be accepted back into her village or family because she is considered culpable			0
last year , a book called " @entity147 " brought to light how the @entity148 perpetrated rape and sexual humiliation on a tremendous scale			0
yet none of this had been revealed or tried at @entity154			0
if we 'd known about this earlier , might it have helped prevent rape camps in the former @entity158 ? or rape as a weapon of genocide in the @entity44 ? naming sexualized violence as a weapon of war makes it visible -- and once visible , prosecutable			1
what happened to men in the past was political , but what happened to women was cultural			2
the political was public and could be changed ; the other was private -- even sacred -- and could not or even should not be changed			2
making clear that sexualized violence is political and public breaks down that wall			1
it acknowledges that sexualized violence does not need to happen			1
when masculinity is no longer defined by the possession and domination of women , when femininity is no longer about the absence of sexual experience or being owned , then we will have begun			0
but first , we have to stop saying sexualized violence is inevitable , or allowing its victims to be blamed			1
we have to imagine change before we can create it			0

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 and @entity190 .			1

@entity189 , @entity190 : rape is used as tool of war to devastate women , communities
they say it has n't been well studied ; understanding its roots is important to stopping it
new project , women @entity204 , aims to study causes of sexualized violence
*writers* : ensuring this violence is acknowledged as political , public is crucial first step
