@entity0 -- @entity3 and @entity4 diplomats spoke in support tuesday of a @entity7 draft resolution that calls for @entity9 president @entity8 to step down , while representatives from @entity11 and @entity12 slammed it as meddlesome			1
more effective than the resolution , @entity11 and @entity12 said , would be the fostering of dialogue within the country			1
" the council can not impose the parameters for an internal political settlement , " said @entity18 , @entity11 's ambassador to the @entity0			1
" we are convinced that at a time of intense internal political crisis , the role of the international community should not be one of exacerbating conflict , nor meddling by use of economic sanctions or military force			0
" the @entity7 is considering a draft resolution proposed by @entity33 that calls for @entity8 to transfer power to his vice president			1
both @entity12 and @entity11 appear poised to veto it			1
the resolution supports " full implementation " of an @entity40 report that called on @entity9 to form a unity government within two months , but stopped short of supporting military intervention or economic sanctions			1
@entity11 -- one of the five veto - wielding permanent members of the @entity7 , as is @entity12 -- has said it is concerned about @entity9 civil war and does not want @entity8 pushed out of power			1
it has proposed its own draft resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both @entity8 and the opposition			0
earlier , @entity3 leaders told the council that @entity9 has failed to make reforms			2
@entity57 's prime minister said " the hope of the @entity9 people is in your hands			1
" @entity62 cited the history of negotiations between the @entity40 and the @entity9 government			2
" the crisis started with absolutely peaceful demonstrations			0
" the prime minister reiterated calls for the violence to end			1
" the government killing machine continues effectively unabated			0
" @entity40 secretary - general @entity73 called for free elections and a multi-party system			0
" do not let the @entity9 people down in its plight			1
" the @entity40 : no longer toothless ? meanwhile , @entity9 's envoy to the @entity0 said the nation is the victim of a systematic campaign to distort facts			2
the @entity40 , he said , is interfering with @entity9 affairs and has ignored reports from observers inside the country			1
" @entity9 is going through decisive challenges in its history , " said ambassador @entity87			2
" we want this stage to be through the will of our people , not through the will of anyone else			0
" " that organization ( the @entity40 ) is not speaking on behalf of all arabs right now			0
without @entity9 , there is not @entity40 , " he said			2
the @entity7 has been unable to agree on any resolution on @entity9			1
in october , @entity11 and @entity12 issued a rare double - veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in @entity9			1
this latest draft also lacks sanctions , but is tougher than the october version , which said nothing about transfer of power			0
the @entity9 regime is a major weapons client for @entity11			1
analysts with @entity113 , a security consulting firm based in @entity114 , said monday in the @entity115 that recent @entity11 arms sales to @entity9 are worth $ 4 billion , and that @entity11 business investments in @entity9 amount to nearly $ 20 billion			1
a @entity120 report in 2008 said the two countries had " concluded several significant arms deals			0
" @entity124 secretary of state @entity123 told the @entity7 that " evidence is clear that @entity8 's forces are initiating nearly all the attacks that kill civilians , but as more citizens take up arms to resist the regime 's brutality , violence is increasingly likely to spiral out of control			1
" she said it is crucial that the international community not embolden " the dictator			0
" " i know that some members here may be concerned that the @entity7 may be headed toward another @entity140			2
that is a false analogy , " @entity141 told the council			0
" @entity9 is a unique situation that requires its own approach , tailored to the specific circumstances on the ground			2
and that is exactly what the @entity40 has proposed -- a path for a political transition that would preserve @entity9 's unity and institutions			2
" she told reporters : " at the end of the day , every member of that @entity7 has a choice to make			2
if you do not choose to try to stand on the side of the @entity9 people , then you are standing on the side of the continuing killing and abuses that are carried out every single day			1
" @entity141 's support of the draft resolution was echoed by @entity169 foreign secretary @entity168 and @entity171 foreign minister @entity170			1
the @entity171 representative said the silence of the council was " no longer acceptable , " while @entity168 stressed that the resolution does not call for military action , " and could not be used to authorize it			2
" " this is not the @entity179 telling @entity9 what to do			1
it is not the permanent members of the @entity7 seeking to impose their view			2
this is the @entity186 calling on the @entity7 to help address the crisis in @entity9 and the threat that it poses to the stability of their region , " he said			1
as diplomats debated , a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in several areas of @entity9 , according to opposition activists			1
at least 7,100 people -- including 461 children -- have died since the start of the anti-government uprising in march , the @entity200 in @entity9 ( @entity200 ) , an opposition group that organizes and documents demonstrations , said tuesday			1
the @entity0 estimated last month that more than 5,000 people have died since march , though it has also said it has been unable to update that figure because of the situation on the ground			0
@entity1 can not independently confirm opposition or government reports from @entity9 because access to the country is limited			1
at least 37 people were confirmed dead tuesday , including 16 in @entity213 , 12 in @entity214 , three in @entity215 , one each in @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 , and three in the @entity217 suburbs , according to the @entity200			0
the group reported 100 deaths monday			0
much of @entity224 , in the eastern suburbs of @entity217 , faces a " complete siege and closure " after days of sustained bombings that killed dozens , the @entity200 said			0
electricity , water , heating fuel and food are in short supply , and communications are interrupted , the @entity200 said			0
" we appeal to the @entity237 and the @entity237 and all relevant international organizations to go to the area and provide relief for its people with food , medicine , and shelter and to pressure the criminal regime to stop its ongoing crimes against our people , " the group said in a statement			0
a spokesman for the rebel group @entity249 in @entity250 , just outside @entity217 , told @entity1 tuesday , " what we are witnessing today is a heavy attack by tanks and artillery on the eastern outskirts			0
" at about 8 a.m. , the army reached the main square , he said			0
there were several " massive explosions , " though it was not clear if they all came from within @entity250 , he said			0
earlier , by 6 a.m. , the city was blocked and no one was allowed to leave amid a " massive presence of soldiers , " he said			0
the spokesman , going by the pseudonym @entity268 , said there were two confirmed deaths in the city			0
on monday , no one could get to a dead body for six hours because of sniper fire , he said			0
@entity1 's @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , and @entity281 contributed to this report .			0
