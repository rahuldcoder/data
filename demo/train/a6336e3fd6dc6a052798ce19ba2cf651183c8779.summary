-- @entity2 football club @entity1 has been left in limbo ahead of its @entity5 game at @entity6 due to the current conflict in @entity8			1
@entity9 is due to face the @entity8 side on july 29 in the city of @entity12 to contest the first leg of the competition 's third qualifying round			1
however , following the @entity18 17 crash last week and the ongoing unrest in @entity8 , the @entity2 club does not know if it will be able to travel by plane for the game or even find a company to insure it for the trip			1
" we are waiting , " @entity9 head of press and communications @entity28 told @entity0			1
" there are some issues right now that we need to get sorted			0
" there is no way our travel agent can find any company that will fly us to @entity8			1
" it 's currently a serious risk to fly over @entity8 , so many , many companies have removed their route to the country			2
we can not get there by flight			0
" furthermore , the @entity2 foreign ministry has labeled the region as being unstable , which means they do not tell us not to go there , but it is not stable			0
they can not guarantee what the situation will be in nine days [ for the match ]			2
" the last point is our insurance company , they do not cover us in the eastern part of @entity8 , where @entity12 is			1
" we need to get these three issues solved , and we have made @entity55 aware of the situation			0
" prior to the @entity18 17 crash , @entity55 's @entity57 decided its @entity60 club competition matches involving @entity8 clubs would be allowed to take place in @entity12 and @entity63 , in addition to @entity65 and @entity66			2
@entity55 has yet to confirm if @entity9 's trip to @entity6 will go ahead , or if it will be played in another venue			1
@entity8 champion @entity69 is currently unable to play matches at its @entity73 stadium due to the conflict in the city of @entity76			1
" for us we have no problem with @entity6 as a club , or the city that they play in , " @entity28 added			2
" we just need to make sure that it is safe to travel , that it is safe to be there and also that we can actually get there -- which right now is our biggest issue			2
" we are not experts , we have to rely on what @entity55 tells us			0
" @entity9 and @entity6 are vying for a place in the @entity5 playoffs , which would then leave one of the clubs two games away from a spot in the group stage of the competition			1
" we are preparing as much as we can			0
but usually at this point normally , for a match of this importance , we have everything ready by now , " @entity28 said			0
" all the details -- transfer plans for players and staff , where to stay , where to eat , everything that would give us the best possible chance of performing on the pitch			0
" but right now we do n't even know if we can get there			0
we are trying to prepare as best as we can , but it is not the ideal way to prepare for a game of this importance			0
