-- @entity1 stirred up fresh unease in @entity3 early thursday , threatening attacks by a " smaller , lighter and diversified " nuclear force and warning , " the moment of explosion is approaching fast			1
" the new threat came after the @entity1 locked @entity11 workers out of a joint factory complex and announced plans to restart a nuclear reactor it shut down five years ago			1
meanwhile , the @entity16 announced it was sending ballistic missile defenses to @entity18 , a @entity19 territory that 's home to @entity16 naval and air bases			1
" the moment of explosion is approaching fast			1
no one can say a war will break out in @entity1 or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow , " @entity1 's state news agency @entity23 declared in its latest broadside			2
" the responsibility for this grave situation entirely rests with the @entity16 administration and military warmongers keen to encroach upon the @entity1 's sovereignty and bring down its dignified social system with brigandish logic			1
" @entity1 is short for @entity1 , the official name for @entity1			2
most observers say the @entity1 is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile			1
@entity16 officials have said they see no unusual military movements across the @entity41 that splits the @entity42 , despite weeks of bombastic rhetoric from @entity44 , and many analysts say the increasingly belligerent talk is aimed at cementing the authority of the country 's young leader , @entity48			1
but the @entity1 does have plenty of conventional military firepower , including medium - range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles			2
and @entity16 defense secretary @entity55 said wednesday that the @entity1 threats to @entity18 , @entity57 and the @entity16 mainland have to be taken seriously			1
" it only takes being wrong once , and i do n't want to be the secretary of defense who was wrong once , " @entity59 told an audience at @entity62 's @entity61			0
but @entity59 also said there was still a " responsible " path for the @entity1 to take			2
" i hope the @entity66 will ratchet this very dangerous rhetoric down , " @entity59 said			0
" there is a pathway that is responsible for the @entity1 to get on a path to peace working with their neighbors			2
there are many , many benefits to their people that could come			0
but they have got to be a responsible member of the world community , and you do n't achieve that responsibility and peace and prosperity by making nuclear threats and taking very provocative actions			0
" shows of force and flights of bombast the @entity16 has in turn made a show of its military strength in the annual drills , flying @entity96 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons , @entity100 - era @entity99 and @entity101 stealth fighters over @entity11			1
@entity23 blamed the @entity16 and its @entity11 allies for the situation , however			1
" we formally inform the @entity105 and @entity106 that the ever - escalating @entity16 hostile policy toward the @entity1 and its reckless nuclear threat will be smashed by the strong will of all the united service personnel and people and cutting - edge smaller , lighter and diversified nuclear strike means of the @entity1 and that the merciless operation of its revolutionary armed forces in this regard has been finally examined and ratified , " it said			1
" the @entity16 had better ponder over the prevailing grave situation			2
" @entity118 , @entity119 spokeswoman , slammed @entity1 's statement as " unhelpful and unconstructive			2
" " it is yet another offering in a long line of provocative statements that only serve to further isolate @entity1 from the rest of the international community and undermine its goal of economic development			2
@entity1 should stop its provocative threats and instead concentrate on abiding by its international obligations , " she said			2
@entity132 , a @entity1 expert at the @entity133 at @entity134 in @entity135 , told @entity0 that the rhetoric is still " too hot			1
it needs to be cooled down			0
" but he added , " if we say that we do n't see any actions yet from them , i have to assume that the @entity16 military still thinks the situation is under control			0
" opinion : why @entity48 is not crazy @entity1 's wednesday decision to prevent @entity11 workers and managers from entering the @entity149 , which sits on the @entity1 's side of the border but houses operations of scores of @entity11 companies , is a tangible sign of the tensions between the two sides			1
@entity1 has demanded the withdrawal of @entity11 workers by april 10 from the complex , @entity11 semi-official news agency @entity160 said thursday			1
but @entity11 's ministry of unification denied the report			0
it 's a move that could end up hurting @entity44 financially , since @entity149 is considered to be an important source of hard currency for @entity48 's government			0
more than 50,000 @entity1 work in the zone , producing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods each year			0
those workers earn on average $ 134 a month , of which @entity1 authorities take about 45 % in various taxes			1
the @entity1 had threatened over the weekend to shut down the industrial complex			1
@entity1 has yet to grant permission for @entity11 to enter the complex , @entity11 's ministry of unification said thursday			1
the nearly 800 @entity11 remaining inside the complex are still able to leave , the ministry said			1
@entity1 's elaborate game of chicken with @entity16 a ' cash cow ' " we are highly skeptical that they will close this cash cow , as some recent reports have suggested , " @entity181 , professor at the @entity182 and @entity183 at the @entity184 , wrote in an article published monday			1
" but if they did , the costs would be higher for the @entity66 , " @entity181 wrote in the article for the @entity191 , a @entity62 - based research organization			0
@entity193 said it " deeply regrets " the @entity1 's decision to stop @entity11 from entering @entity149			1
" @entity1 's action creates a barrier to the stable operation " of the complex , the @entity195 said in a statement , urging its neighbor to " immediately normalize " the entry and exit process			1
and @entity11 defense minister @entity204 said military action could be taken if the safety of the @entity11 in the zone were to come under threat			2
" if there is a serious situation , we are fully ready , including military measures , " he said at a meeting of lawmakers , the semiofficial @entity11 news agency @entity160 reported			0
@entity16 moves warship , sea - based radar to watch @entity1 the @entity66 has blocked the crossing into @entity149 before			1
in march 2009 , also during joint @entity16 - @entity11 military drills that it said were a threat , @entity44 shut the border , temporarily trapping hundreds of @entity11 workers in the industrial complex			1
it allowed many of the stranded workers to return to @entity11 the next day , and fully reopened the border about a week later without explaining its reversal			2
it was unclear whether the latest drama over @entity149 would play out in similar fashion			0
at the start of the day , when the @entity66 informed the @entity11 that it would prevent new entries to the complex , there were 861 @entity11 workers in there , according to the @entity195			1
the @entity66 said it would continue to let people leave the zone			0
hundreds of workers rotate in and out of @entity149 each day in a series of scheduled entries and exits			0
many of them stay there for several nights			0
during the late morning and early afternoon exit windows , only a trickle of workers was seen returning to @entity11 from @entity149 , far fewer than the scores who were registered to leave at those times			2
@entity11 authorities did n't immediately provide an explanation for the discrepancy , saying the individual companies decide when to send workers back			2
@entity257 - sin , the manager of a textile manufacturing company in @entity149 who came back into @entity11 on wednesday , said some people were staying in the complex because " they are worried they might not be able to come back in			2
" during the march 2009 crisis , many @entity11 companies with operations in the zone chose to keep more workers there to compensate for those not being allowed in			2
@entity48 said he was scheduled to go back into @entity149 on thursday , but was n't optimistic			0
" i think if this continues there , business will be affected , " @entity48 said			0
" i think the damage will be serious			0
" @entity274 calls north ' reckless ' @entity16 and @entity11 officials have kept up their criticism of the @entity1 's actions in recent days			1
@entity274 , the @entity16 secretary of state , warned tuesday that the @entity16 will not accept @entity1 as a " nuclear state			1
" " the bottom line is simply that what @entity48 is choosing to do is provocative			0
it is dangerous , reckless , " @entity274 said during a joint briefing in @entity62 with @entity11 foreign minister @entity283			0
" and i reiterate again the @entity16 will do what is necessary to defend ourselves and defend our allies , @entity1 and @entity289 , " @entity274 added			1
" we are fully prepared and capable of doing so , and i think the @entity1 understands that			0
" the @entity66 has conducted three nuclear bomb tests , the most recent in february			0
it has said that its nuclear weapons are a deterrent that are no longer up for negotiation			0
@entity132 said @entity1 's longer - range missiles may not be ready to be used for three to four years , and its nuclear program is a " low - level threat " at this point			0
he said @entity62 's most recent moves could be caused by it seeing some sort of movement around @entity1 missile facilities , or it could be " misreading and over-reading @entity1 propaganda but fulfilling their obligation to be on guard and prepared			1
" " we 're going to get out of this particular crisis , it seems to me , without anything really blowing up , " @entity132 said			0
" but down the road , things are going to get more serious			0
" " what we should be looking at , really , is the decisions and the policies and the approach that we 're going to have to take over the next four or five years to deal with these things , " he added			0
" because for the last five years , we really did n't do a very good job of doing that			0
" @entity0 's @entity320 and @entity321 in @entity322 , @entity11 ; @entity323 in @entity193 ; @entity324 and @entity325 in @entity326 ; @entity327 and @entity328 in @entity62 ; and @entity329 in @entity330 contributed to this report .			0
