-- there 's a man defecating on my desk			0
but , sadly , it 's not @entity7			0
for surely that might count , then , as an oddly spectacular life moment worth @entity10			0
thanks , @entity7 ! # @entity11 no , the squatting @entity5 defecator i speak of is actually a three - inch - tall plastic figurine known as a @entity15			1
i bought it a while back in @entity18 , and , believe it or not , he 's a traditional fixture in @entity21 nativity scenes , which , apparently , are inspired by parking lots at @entity25 games			0
so , i keep my little @entity15 near my computer because it makes me smile			0
but i also just like having interesting desk toys , even though it seems i 've clearly been missing out on the single greatest one of all			0
you see , this week the interwebs suddenly started buzzing about a very specific desk toy called @entity36			1
i had never actually heard of these things , but online chatter went a little crazy right after the company announced they were discontinuing production of their hugely popular and addictive shape - changing magnetic beads			1
if you 're not quite sure what i 'm talking about , just think stress ball meets marbles meets @entity46 ... ... meets possible agonizing pain			2
magnetic @entity36 toys discontinued amazingly , while everyone from @entity51 to @entity52 to the @entity53 has boasted about these tiny little magnetic balls of joy , the @entity49 has basically deemed them to be just slightly less dangerous than trying to administer a hernia test to an unwilling gorilla			1
in fact , this past july , in their official lawsuit against the makers of @entity36 , the commission noted that the magnets " contain a defect in the design , packaging , warnings and instructions which pose a substantial risk of injury to the public			1
" it turns out kids like shiny things			2
and sometimes they swallow shiny things			2
but when those shiny things happen to be superpowerful magnets , it 's actually a fairly serious health concern			2
many retailers voluntarily stopped selling buckyballs at the safety commission 's request , but the distributor , @entity81 , continued to manufacture and sell the product			1
that 's when @entity36 put out this statement : " due to baseless and relentless legal badgering by a certain four letter government agency , it 's time to bid a fond farewell to the world 's most popular adult desk toys , @entity36 and @entity91			1
that 's right : we 're sad to say that @entity94 have a one - way ticket to the @entity97 - @entity96			2
" buckyball supporters were furious			1
now i feel their pain			1
because these things are amazing ! while writing this , i decided to step away from my work and scour the newsroom to see if anyone actually had @entity36			1
i wanted to test them out , but -- truth be told -- i also ca n't concentrate for more than 30 seconds at a time			0
so , i figured i might as well walk around and distract my co-workers			0
the logical first stop was @entity111 's desk , because his cubicle always seems to have a certain level of " flair			0
" unfortunately , since @entity36 have nothing to do with " @entity116 " he did n't have any -- lest they disrupt the delicate feng shui of his @entity119 shrine			1
" you have failed me for the last time , @entity111			0
" fortunately , his desk neighbor , @entity121 , did have @entity36 ! however , she was n't in the office yet , so i could n't just politely borrow them for an hour			1
thus , i politely stole them			0
walking around the newsroom with this small mass of tiny round magnets was like coming to work with a puppy			0
everyone wanted to hold it , and i watched seemingly mature adults delightfully morph into whimsical children , completely in awe of this strange , invisible force			0
for as the great @entity137 poets , @entity138 , once asked , " ( @entity139 ) magnets -- how do they work ? " cute as it may have been to watch my colleagues smiling like little kids , the irony is that it 's real children who have brought buckyballs to their end			2
despite the fact that , since 2010 , there have been warning labels in five places on each box , and additional inserts specifically instructing adults to keep these far , far away from kids ( you know , like poison or guns or that one creepy neighbor who always brags about once being on " @entity161 " ) , buckyballs are still being swallowed			2
so , the debate rages online : was it right for the government to go after @entity36 , or has the company properly done its due diligence to warn and protect consumers ? it 's sort of a moot point since , at least for now , what they have in stock is all that 's left			1
though , i suppose you could always just politely steal them from @entity121 's desk .			0

the makers of @entity36 are discontinuing them because of safety concerns
buckyballs are hugely popular and *superaddictive* shape - changing magnetic beads
@entity36 supporters are furious . i feel their pain . because these things are amazing !
