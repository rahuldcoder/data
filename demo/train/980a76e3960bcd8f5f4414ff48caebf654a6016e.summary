@entity9 , 17 , recreates his pose from 1991 's @entity12 " album			1
@entity9 , the underwater infant pursuing a dollar bill on the cover of 1991 's " nevermind , " is doing swimmingly these days , having graduated a year early from a @entity16 - area high school			1
being the " @entity4 baby " -- as @entity9 calls himself -- has been profitable			1
now 17 , @entity9 says he was paid $ 1,000 to re-enact the famous pool pose for photographers			1
compare that to the original shoot , which paid $ 200			0
" stuff happens like random cool situations where i get paid $ 500 just to go hang out , " @entity9 said			2
" people just call me up and they 're like , ' hey you 're the @entity4 baby , right ? well just come and swim in my pool and we 'll give you some money			1
' " read more about @entity9 and the 1991 photo shoot not everyone can say their naked baby picture has become part of @entity36 's pop - culture psyche			1
like @entity4 , @entity9 hopes to entertain us			1
he wants to be an artist or graphic designer			0
@entity9 has snagged an internship with street artist @entity41 , creator of the ubiquitous @entity45 red , white and blue @entity43 posters			1
@entity41 heard @entity9 interviewed on the radio and one thing led to another , said the teen			2
@entity51 fame has " been a really good foot in the door , " he said			0
a @entity55 film role might be in the works , but @entity9 and his father , who is also a designer and artist , are n't revealing any details			1
" some director 's been calling me and wondering maybe about doing a movie with me as one of the characters in it , " said @entity9			1
" it sounds like fun			0
" it 's all very exciting , he said , for a self - described normal teen who spends a lot of time drawing			0
really , all he wants is a guest spot on the " @entity72			0
" " i think it would be fun just to hang out and chill with him for a while , " he said of the @entity75 / @entity74 radio host			0
all the hoopla swirling around @entity80 proves that @entity4 's musical contribution stands the test of 17 years as a major milestone in music history			1
" @entity12 " has become a pop culture rarity : a specific item widely regarded as a pivotal point in cultural change			1
the album marks the musical shift from the bouncy , upbeat rhythms and melodies that were popular in the 1980s to the dour and cynical " grunge " music that audiences widely embraced in the 1990s			2
@entity97 : show us your grunge days and reflect on " @entity12 " with " nevermind , " grunge , as the mainstream press dubbed it , had risen from " underground alternative " to the global mainstream			2
ireporter : @entity4 taught me how to play music the triumph blew 1980s - style " poodle - hair metal " music off the map , wrote @entity113 magazine , which in 2003 ranked " @entity12 " at no. 17 of the 500 greatest albums of all time			1
even when the album ascended to the top of the charts , it made its own rebellious statement , dethroning the @entity121 by knocking @entity121 's album " dangerous " from @entity124 's no. 1 spot			2
" @entity12 " essentially sowed the seeds for music that defined the 1990s , said @entity127 , author of " 1,000 recordings to hear before you die			2
" " you could argue that whatever @entity36 indie alternative rock was , by the time @entity4 came along , it became something different after that			2
" front man @entity133 proved himself to be " a great hooksman , " said @entity127 , especially with the album 's breakout track " @entity137			2
" @entity133 's verses " are sort of atmospheric sometimes " and then " bust down the door " with an explosive chorus , " @entity127 said			0
" they were n't the first to do this , but @entity4 took it in a much more abrupt direction			0
it 's exciting and it still works			0
" that point was echoed last month when @entity148 , a cultural oracle for indie geeks , listed the song among its top 500 tunes " from punk to the present			0
" @entity155 chimed in and praised the song 's " four - chord power sequence that never , ever changes " which , although unique , mixes the rhythm from @entity159 's " @entity158			0
" " if you 'd asked one hundred @entity166 / @entity165 wannabes how f - b - flat - a - flat resolves , one hundred of them would 've told you it goes to @entity168 , duh			0
@entity133 [ @entity133 ] knocked the world on its ass by choosing d - flat instead , " wrote @entity155 's @entity169			0
@entity4 's promise was cut short in 1994 by @entity133 's suicide at age 27 in his @entity177 , @entity178 , home			1
but the band 's success opened the flood gates for flannel - clad , angst - ridden rockers including @entity183 , @entity184 and others			0
" it was no accident that @entity187 , @entity188 and bands like that connected in the wake of what @entity4 did , " said @entity127			0
" the musical ideas that @entity4 was about were so powerful they could n't help but spread			1
