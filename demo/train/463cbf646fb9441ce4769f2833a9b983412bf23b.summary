-- @entity1 has spent $ 12 billion getting ready for the big game sunday			1
now it 's time to cook the wings , prepare the dip , order the pizza , put the beer on ice			1
the @entity9 are favored to win their sixth @entity11 title , but can the @entity12 send their magnificent , but controversial , linebacker @entity13 into retirement with a second championship ring ? will the @entity12 defense be able to stop young quarterback @entity17 from beating them with his right arm and his legs ? who will win the battle of super siblings ? who will have the best commercial ? will it be sexy or funny ? will the halftime show be live ? ok , @entity28 assures us it will			1
here are five other story lines you might be talking about around the snack table before the game kicks off in @entity35 at 6:30 p.m. et : 1			1
some fans are ' @entity37 ' @entity39 basketball coach @entity38 will be one of the 72,000 fans at the game			1
but he and his wife , @entity42 , and her parents wo n't be pulling for the @entity12 to maul the 49ers or for @entity45 to knock off @entity12			1
you see @entity42 's brothers , @entity48 and @entity49 , are the two opposing head coaches in the big game			1
@entity48 coaches the @entity12 , @entity49 leads @entity45			1
" i get , ' which brother are you rooting for ? ' " @entity42 told the @entity53			1
" i 'm sure it 's a joke			2
" in a perfect world , @entity55 would like to see the @entity57 end in a tie , but she and her husband , @entity59 , know they will have one son on sunday night who 'll be ecstatic and one who 'll be melancholy			1
join our @entity57 hangout online " there is going to be one winner and there is going to be one who is going to be totally disappointed , " said @entity66 , who coached for 43 years			1
" my thoughts go to that one that will not experience the thrill of victory			2
that 's where our thoughts will be			2
" and mom and dad , married for 51 years , will be there to make things a little better			1
" we 're going to hug both of them and tell them how proud we are of them and their teams , " @entity55 said			2
the old coach said he was just as proud of his sons this week as he was in the days when they each told him they made the junior high or high school football team			2
or when they said they earned a college scholarship -- @entity49 to @entity94 and @entity48 to @entity95 in @entity96			1
" the thrill that you feel -- i know this is on a big stage -- but in parenting , those do n't rank any differently , " he said			2
" @entity104 " inspires , draws criticism at pastor @entity107 's church , @entity105 is on the @entity12 ' side			1
and why not ? @entity107 is @entity13 ' pastor , the man who helped lead @entity13 to redemption			2
people at the @entity113 call @entity114			2
" @entity107 says the title fits			2
" he 's a jack leg preacher without a license , no @entity117 college , but it 's just in him , " @entity107 said			2
" he 's spoken here a couple of times , i 've put him up to do our @entity117 study , and he 's like @entity127 and @entity128 ( @entity130 ) @entity129 wrapped into one			2
" fans say @entity13 ' in - your - face faith and extensive community service is beautifully sincere			2
his critics find it phony -- a redemption tour with no true redemption			2
" redemption ? stop acting like you are one of those people that come out of the @entity117 , " @entity140 told @entity0			2
thirteen years ago , @entity140 's nephew , @entity145 , and his buddy , @entity146 , were stabbed to death outside of an @entity149 nightclub			2
@entity13 and two others were charged in their killings			2
opinion : keep dancing for @entity153 , @entity13 ! four months later , @entity13 pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice			2
a jury acquitted @entity156 and @entity157			0
" it was self - defense for me because someone attacked me , " @entity157 told @entity0			0
today , @entity13 insists whatever happened in @entity149 changed him			0
" with everything i 've been through in my whole life , the thing for me to be here today and my only purpose in life is to find ways to help people and encourage people and make our world a better place , " he said			0
@entity107 compares @entity13 to the biblical figure @entity174			0
" @entity174 was a man after @entity105 's own heart , after committing adultery , after committing murder , after being negligent on the job , after being taken out of position , " @entity107 said			1
" he 's still somebody who @entity105 honored , and i think that many times history ca n't appreciate it while you 're in it , it 's only after you walk away			0
" that is the definition of redemption , @entity107 said			0
it 's not what you 've done , it 's what you 've become			0
from starter to mentor @entity193 ca n't help but be a little disappointed even though the 49ers are in the game of their lives			0
just a few months ago , @entity193 was @entity45 's starting quarterback before a concussion sent him to the sideline			0
@entity17 , the second - year backup , played even better than @entity193 , stayed in the lineup and had a big role in getting the 49ers to the @entity57			1
he said @entity193 has been supportive since losing his spot			0
" it means a lot , " @entity17 said this week			0
" i think it really shows his character and the kind of man he is			0
he 's helped me through everything , from @entity212 ' til now			0
" the non-fan 's guide to @entity57 parties @entity193 , who is healthy again , said he said he became a starter in college at @entity218 when their no. 1 quarterback went down			1
" i 'd be pretty hypocritical to be upset about it , " @entity193 said			0
" it 's the nature of sports			0
he got an opportunity , stepped up and made the most of it			0
" @entity226 reported this week that @entity193 will ask to be released in the offseason , giving him greater control of which team he will play for next			0
the 49ers also could trade him , or keep him , but not many teams would want to pay their backup quarterback $ 8.5 million			0
it 's unlikely @entity49 will pull @entity17 if he struggles , but if he is injured the 49ers have little to worry about in his replacement			1
distractions , distractions , distractions this @entity57 has had more distractions than most			1
first there was @entity13 being asked whether he had taken a banned substance called deer antler spray			0
then 49ers cornerback @entity242 said tuesday he did n't want any gay players on his team			0
add to that the story of tv analyst @entity246 fathering a child out of wedlock and @entity45 's @entity249 boasting he was the best receiver of all time ( to which @entity251 replied , " scoreboard			1
" ) players were sure the media circus would n't affect @entity255			0
" you get to play at this level because most of the guys are mentally tough , so when you get out there , the last thing you 're going to be thinking about is what people are saying , " 49ers center @entity256 said			0
@entity265 sunday : survival of the cutest @entity12 center @entity268 said the being a professional football player requires staying focused at the task at hand , something some guys ca n't handle			1
he said he compartmentalizes the bad stuff , blocks it out			0
@entity276 , a 49ers linebacker , defended @entity242			1
" in this business , it 's always going to be something , and we know those guys , " he said			0
" we know those guys ' hearts			0
we know that those things that come out of their mouths are n't intended to hurt anyone or intended to make it about them			1
" @entity242 apologized wednesday and again thursday , saying : " i 'm sorry that i offended anyone			0
they were very ugly comments , and that 's not what i feel in my heart			0
hopefully , i can learn and grow from this experience and this situation			0
@entity35 on the comeback @entity35 is playing host to its 10th @entity57 and even though locals are crushed that the hometown @entity301 are n't playing in the game , they are happy to show a city that has rebounded strongly from @entity305 seven years ago			1
" we 're in an economic resurrection of the city , " actor and businessman @entity306 said			1
" this is a point in time that people will remember that @entity35 was on its way back			1
we came from total destruction and now we 're hosting one of the great events known to the world			0
" the @entity317 says the big game served as a goal line to cross for more than $ 1 billion in improvements to the city			1
much of that was spent fixing up the airport , where most fans will get a first impression of the city that depends heavily on tourism			1
@entity35 officials hope that some of the fans do n't pack up and leave on monday			0
after all , there 's another big event going on			0
@entity332 ! it 's the best time ever , @entity306 said			1
" you 're right in the middle of the greatest street party in the history of the world , @entity332 , " he said			1
" to have the @entity57 join that , it 's one of the most festive times to be here in @entity35			1
we 're going to have great food , great time and one of the greatest games in ... world sports			1
" ' @entity348 ' a big score for @entity35 @entity0 's @entity350 contributed to this report .			0

there will be plenty of time to kill when you get to the @entity57 party hours before kickoff
one of the things to *discuss* are the brothers @entity49 and how their family remains neutral
@entity12 linebacker has gone from murder suspect to @entity104
host city wants to show @entity1 how far it has come since @entity305
