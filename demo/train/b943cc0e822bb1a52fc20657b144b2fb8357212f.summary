-- the @entity2 sisters have not had it easy in recent years			1
two of the modern era 's most successful women tennis players have been beset by health problems which have deprived the game of two of its most marketable stars			1
@entity2 has overcome life - threatening blood clots on both lungs , while older sibling @entity14 is this week making her long - awaited @entity16 comeback as she battles a debilitating illness that has sidelined her since last year 's @entity18			1
after pulling out of her second - round match in @entity20 , @entity14 revealed she had been diagnosed with @entity22 's syndrome -- an incurable condition which affects energy levels and causes pain in the joints			1
" i just did n't feel well before my second - round match , to the point where i could n't play , " the 31 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity29 show			1
" at the beginning of the tournament , i was n't sure how far i would get or what i would do , i was kind of living on a hope and a dream			0
" after a glittering 18 - year professional career which has seen her become the first black woman to be ranked world no. 1 in the @entity18 era , winning seven grand slam singles titles and 12 major doubles crowns alongside @entity2 , @entity2 would have been forgiven for deciding to chuck in the towel			1
but , instead of eying an early retirement , the winner of three olympic gold medals set her sights on managing her illness and returning to the baseline ahead of this year 's @entity51			1
" when you do n't feel well and things are taken away from you , it 's hard to stay positive , " the former world no. 1 said			1
" but , for me , it is not an option to get negative or to feel sorry for myself			0
" it 's easy to say , ' i 've done enough ' -- or it would be easy to go on a permanent vacation			2
but i need to look back and know that i gave everything			0
" i know i still have so much more			0
before i was sick i was on top of the world in singles and doubles			2
so that 's my goal , to return to that			1
" @entity2 has played just one @entity68 doubles rubber for the @entity71 team and an exhibition match against @entity2 since withdrawing in @entity20 on august 31 , and she will make her return as a wildcard at the @entity75 this week -- an event she has won on three occasions			1
" i 'm looking forward to coming back , " she said			0
" @entity22 's syndrome definitely changed my life , it changed everything			1
it changed how i eat , it changed my whole life			0
" learning to manage her condition has given @entity2 hope of returning to her imperious best			2
by managing her diet , she is aiming to one day play unaffected by the syndrome 's debilitating symptoms			2
" i do n't think the road will be perfect , but i think i can get it as close to perfect as possible , " she said			0
" my hope is to be symptom - free one day			0
i work with my doctors on that , but also i work on my diet , which i 've found has been huge			0
with @entity22 's you deal with a lot of fatigue and joint pain and inflammation			1
" it 's because of the things i 'm eating			0
i 've started eating raw , vegan , unprocessed foods , doing lots of juicing , i juice twice a day			0
for me , it 's worth doing everything i can to get back to what i love doing			0
" another motivator for @entity2 is the prospect of challenging for a fourth @entity111 in @entity112 , where the tennis tournament will be held at @entity114			2
@entity2 has enjoyed huge success at the @entity116 in the past , having won five singles titles and four doubles crowns at the prestigious grass - court venue			1
" for me , the @entity120 have been the pinnacle of my career -- this will be my fourth , " she said			0
" @entity2 and i talk about playing in every @entity120 possible , we keep saying how we 're going to be take spots on the team forever ! " it is our dream , it is beyond our dreams			2
to participate would be great , to win something would be amazing			0
