their mother wore the pin , at her son 's request , at one of his murder trials , @entity13 said			2
criminal profiler @entity123 , who exchanged dozens of letters with @entity13 and visited him on death row , said @entity13 explained to him that @entity5 had hired him to break into his ex-wife 's condo to steal diamond earrings he had given her			1
" @entity30 told me that @entity5 's instructions were that ' you may have to kill the bitch , ' " @entity123 said			1
" those were his exact words			0
" @entity3 told him about a spare key to the condo hidden outside the door , according to @entity123 's description of @entity13 ' account			1
the attack happened on steps outside , though , when @entity74 unexpectedly arrived , he said			0
the documentary includes a graphic re-creation of how @entity13 described the attack to @entity123			0
@entity3 , who was waiting in his car nearby , walked onto the bloody sidewalk to check @entity13 ' work , thus leaving his footprints at the crime scene , @entity123 said			2
@entity52 prosecutors matched a shoe print taken from the scene to the sole of an expensive @entity154 shoe they contended @entity5 owned			0
@entity13 began a cross-country killing spree that included about 70 female victims after the @entity3 and @entity74 murders , the film said			1
he was captured in @entity115 in november 1995 , weeks after @entity5 was freed from jail			0
@entity13 was sentenced to death in @entity16 after a jury convicted him of killing a woman in a @entity164 motel			1
he was later convicted of murdering a @entity17 woman , which resulted in a second death sentence			2
no other states have tried him			0
he is awaiting execution in @entity16 and has no more appeals , according to the film			0
assistant district attorney @entity172 , who prosecuted @entity13 in the 1990s , said @entity13 may have an ulterior motive for claiming to have killed @entity3 and @entity74			1
" @entity13 is on death row in @entity16 and @entity17			1
if he 's close to execution in @entity16 , he may be hoping that @entity17 will bring him back here which would postpone the execution , " @entity172 said			1
the @entity3 and @entity74 killings did not match @entity13 ' other killings , @entity172 added			1
" @entity13 and @entity5 's cases do n't match except that all the victims were stabbed			1
@entity13 was a good - looking guy			0
he would go to bars , pick up women , court them , sometimes live with them a while , then kill them			0
the one victim he murdered in @entity52 , he killed the night he met her			0
