@entity15 faced similar charges , including spreading chaos , questioning the authority of official clerics and undermining public order			2
in an interview with @entity0 in january , @entity14 called the accusations against him and @entity15 nonsense , saying he knows why he and @entity15 were really put on trial -- that they had stoked the ire of the kingdom for running an activist group that is trying to expose human rights violations there			1
