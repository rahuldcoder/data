-- seven members of a breakaway @entity3 group in eastern @entity4 were arrested on federal hate crime charges for allegedly shaving the beards and cutting the hair of individuals who refused to support their leader , according to a criminal complaint released wednesday			1
one of the seven men is @entity12 , the leader of the breakaway sect and a man that local law enforcement and other @entity3 in the area consider a cult leader			1
@entity12 ruled the group with an iron fist , in some cases " forcing members to sleep for days at a time in a chicken coop " and beating those " who appear to disobey " him , according to an @entity25 affidavit			1
@entity12 had been " counseling " married women in his sect , " taking them into his home so that he may cleanse them of the devil with acts of sexual intimacy , " the sworn statement from an @entity25 agent said			2
law enforcement officials believe he was behind the various beard and hair cutting attacks of the past few months			1
the men charged are said to have carried out " a series of assaults against fellow @entity3 individuals with whom they were having a religiously based dispute , " according to the @entity44			1
the @entity3 who were attacked are believed to be former members of @entity12 's group who left over various disagreements			1
@entity12 wanted to " seek revenge and punish the departing families , " the federal documents said			1
" in doing so , the defendants forcibly restrained multiple @entity3 men and cut off their beards and head hair with scissors and battery - powered clippers , causing bodily injury to these men while also injuring others who attempted to stop the attacks , " the @entity44 said			1
" in the @entity3 religion , a man 's beard and head hair are sacred			1
" several of the men have confessed their involvement to local investigators , according to a sworn statement by an @entity25 agent that was attached to the complaint filed in @entity76			1
the seven men were arrested as part of a raid on @entity12 's 800 - acre compound that went down " without incident " early wednesday morning , according to @entity81 , a spokesman for the @entity83 attorney in the @entity84 of @entity4			2
a combination of " about 40 " officials from various agencies , including the @entity25 , the @entity88 , and the @entity89 and @entity90 sheriffs , were involved in the raid , @entity81 said			2
@entity93 @entity92 , who was at the raid , said they hit @entity12 's home at 6 in the morning			2
everyone was asleep at the time			0
" three guys at first did n't want to come out of their rooms , but the @entity25 got them out of there , " @entity92 said			0
@entity99 said he was happy about the arrest			0
and i tell you what , so is the @entity3 community ... i 'm happy for the @entity3 people who are so fearful of that guy			1
" @entity92 added that what made arrests so difficult in this case is the fact that @entity3 generally do n't believe in dealing with law enforcement , so charges had never been pressed			1
while he 's generally happy the arrests were made , part of him is also worried some of the people who live on the compound under his rule will remain " brainwashed " and not have enough will power to move away while @entity12 is in custody			0
he urged them to seize the opportunity			0
" now 's the chance if you want to get out			0
now 's the time to go , " he said			0
the defendants appeared in federal court wednesday afternoon			1
a magistrate ordered them held until a detention hearing , @entity81 said			0
no date has been set for the hearing			0
@entity12 's sect is made up primarily of his relatives living on and around the compound in a remote valley outside @entity136 , @entity4 , officials say			2
the alleged religiously motivated physical assaults were a violation of the @entity140 - @entity139 , the @entity44 said wednesday			0
if convicted , each man could face up to life in prison , it said			0
five of the men were arrested last month on charges of kidnapping and burglary stemming from an incident at the home of @entity151 and @entity152 in early october in which a group of men pulled @entity155 out of the home by his beard , held him down , and cut off large portions of the beard			1
the incident at the @entity162 ' home was one of a handful of incidents in several counties in which as many as 30 men and women carried out similar attacks , @entity93 @entity160 said			2
when @entity0 asked the senior mullet last month if he was behind the beard incident , he responded by asking rhetorically , " @entity171 cutting is a crime , is it ? " he then denied the allegations that he was running a cult			0
asked about what was , at the time , the start of a federal investigation , @entity12 said , " we 're not guilty , so we have nothing to hide			2
if they want to come and check us out , we 'd be glad to see them here			0
" @entity0 's @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
