-- @entity1 hated the stares			1
whenever his family went out to eat , strangers ' eyes would follow -- gawking at the sizes of father and son , judging the food on their plates			1
at 5 feet 7 inches , @entity1 weighed 321 pounds			1
his son , @entity11 , was 5 feet 3 inches and weighed 333 pounds			1
" it 's like they 'd never seen a fat person before , " @entity1 recalls			1
for @entity1 , the decision to go through with weight loss surgery was about stopping those stares , getting in shape and , most importantly , saving his son 's life			1
in denial when his dad first approached him about going to a weight loss clinic , 17 - year - old @entity22 was hesitant			1
unlike many children who are bullied because of their weight , @entity11 had a lot of friends and did n't really see his size as an issue			1
@entity11 was more concerned about his dad 's health			1
@entity1 was on medication for acid reflux disease , hypertension and high cholesterol			1
" to think that , that young , i might lose him before i was 20 -- it 's not something you want , " @entity11 says			1
" and i always thought if i kept going down the same path , i would be like him or worse			0
" still , @entity11 was nervous			1
maybe , he thought , i 'll just try dieting again			0
@entity45 stops many people from getting weight loss procedures done , says dr. @entity48 , the @entity1 's doctor and a bariatric surgeon in @entity50			1
but often the biggest obstacle is denial -- they do n't want to admit they ca n't do it on their own			0
" the hardest thing for patients to do is pick up the phone and go see a doctor , " @entity48 says			2
" they see it as a kind of defeat			0
" bariatric surgery does n't help obese live longer , study finds there are several types of bariatric surgery			1
most cost between $ 18,000 and $ 30,000			0
gastric bypass has been the " gold standard , " @entity48 says , since the 1990s			0
with gastric bypass , a new stomach about the size of a golf ball is created laparoscopically by cutting across the top of the stomach and connecting the smaller pouch with the intestines			0
@entity1 knew about gastric bypass but did n't like how invasive it was ; he did n't know if he wanted to restructure his internal organs that way			1
then he started seeing commercials for @entity84			1
the @entity85 approved @entity87 's @entity86 in february 2011			0
( @entity48 sits on @entity87 's doctor approval board			2
) the first adjustable gastric band , @entity91 's realize , was approved in 2007			0
both bands are placed laparoscopically around the upper portion of the stomach in an outpatient procedure that generally takes 45 minutes to an hour			0
the devices can be tightened or loosened at subsequent doctor 's visits , helping patients " feel full faster , eat less and lose weight			1
" and unlike gastric bypass , adjustable gastric band procedures can be easily reversed			0
the @entity85 has approved the @entity84 for patients over 18 with a @entity103 over 40 , or patients with a @entity103 over 30 who also have a serious obesity - related condition like high - blood pressure or sleep apnea			1
surgery no quick fix for obese teens @entity1 had a @entity103 of 50			1
his son 's was 59			2
" with all the excess weight on him , it was putting so much stress on his heart , " @entity1 says			1
" for me this would be a good thing			0
" two years , 200 pounds shortly after @entity121 2009 , @entity1 and @entity11 were ready for surgery			1
@entity1 was ready to give up the @entity124 food he loved as a child ; @entity11 was determined to no longer constantly eat just because he was bored			1
they had completed all the prerequisites			0
@entity48 asks patients to lose 5 to 10 pounds before undergoing anesthesia , to ensure they 're willing to make the serious commitment that 's forthcoming			2
he stresses that the @entity84 is just a tool to help patients lose weight			1
" the main thing we talk about is motivation , " @entity48 says			0
" if they ca n't change their lifestyle , they are n't going to lose more than 30 to 40 pounds			2
" that might seem like a lot to some , but most who undergo the surgery have 80 to 100 pounds to lose			1
and if they do n't eat right and exercise , they 'll most likely gain it all back			0
the @entity148 also knew about the risks			0
the @entity85 lists possible complications from the @entity84 procedure : vomiting , difficulty swallowing , gastroesophageal reflux disease , abdominal pain , pulmonary embolism or leaking that could lead to death			2
weight - loss surgery may raise risk of alcohol abuse fortunately , their dual procedures went smoothly			1
@entity1 and @entity11 were on a liquid diet for two weeks after surgery , and then ate only soft foods for another two weeks			1
it would be several more weeks before they learned what they could eat and how much			0
" you have to chew your food really well , 20 to 25 times before you swallow , " @entity1 says			2
" the more fibrous vegetables , they do n't digest as well			0
the skin of peaches , apples , do n't digest well			0
" carbohydrates are pretty much off - limits as well , @entity11 says			2
before the surgery , he would usually have a sandwich , chips and soda or a few pieces of pizza for lunch			2
now he eats maybe half a chicken breast and half a cucumber			0
dinners used to be double servings			0
now he orders off the kids ' menu at restaurants and can barely eat half			0
" when food gets stuck , it 's painful			0
it feels like you 're having a heart attack or something , " @entity11 says			2
the results , though , have been phenomenal			0
@entity11 has dropped 160 pounds ; his dad has lost more than 100			1
" it 's been fun and exciting to watch them , " says his mom , @entity203			0
@entity11 is always out now , compared to what he used to be			2
and my husband ... he likes to share his story with everybody			0
even with people he does n't even know			0
" @entity11 was named @entity48 's patient of the month			2
" he was so shy and introverted , never looked people in the eye , " @entity48 says			0
" when he lost 100 pounds he opened up and came out of his shell			2
plus the guy ate chicken all day long			0
" @entity48 likes when family members tackle weight loss together			1
they motivate each other to stick with the diet , keep junk food out of the house and keep moving			0
@entity11 and @entity1 had a sense of competition -- when his dad was losing weight more quickly , @entity11 took up basketball to catch up			1
at 170 pounds , @entity11 is almost to his goal weight of 150			1
he plans to swim more and try other activities that he could n't do when he was bigger			0
he also hopes to help other obese teens by sharing his story			2
@entity1 is working on reaching his goal weight as well			1
he knows as an adult it 's more difficult to lose the weight , but he keeps pushing forward			2
" i really want to be as healthy as possible for my family			0

@entity1 and his son @entity11 were *extremely* obese , with @entity240 over 50
the pair had @entity84 surgery in 2009 and have since lost more than 200 pounds
having a family support *system* is great for weight loss surgery , doctor says
