-- a 400 - year - old tradition is facing some new challenges this year at this week 's annual running of the bulls in @entity5			1
celebrations for the @entity7 are already underway , but the first running of the bulls will be held wednesday in the northern @entity5 town of @entity11			2
the city is once again handing out 100,000 leaflets to local and foreign festival - goers explaining how to minimize the risk of accidents during the spectacle			2
it 's a warning and a reminder of the dangers and even death that can occur when hundreds of runners sprint alongside the half - ton bulls and steers			2
last year saw the first fatal goring in more a decade			2
for the sixth year now , @entity11 has sprayed the entire 825 meter route with a special anti-slipping chemical to help avoid injury to the bulls and the red - and - white clad runners			1
the run in @entity11 started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author @entity31 wrote about it in the 1920s in his book " @entity35 , " also published under the title " @entity35			0
" the event is held july 7 - 14			2
six bulls and a pack of tame steers run from the corrals , through @entity11 's old town , to the bullring -- where the bulls will die later in the day in a bullfight			0
including the recent death , 14 people have been killed in the runs since 1924 , when record - keeping began			0
but while the narrow cobblestone streets of @entity11 are expected to be as packed as ever , the tradition of bullfights , or " corridas " is under pressure elsewhere			0
the economic downturn is certainly taking its toll			1
with nearly one in five @entity5 out of a job there are fewer spectators packing the rings			1
and struggling towns are looking for ways to slash spending			0
some local governments are cutting the expensive spectacles to save money for basic services like schools and police salaries			0
but there is also pressure brewing to change cultural attitudes about the tradition of bullfighting as well			0
just as most other years , @entity74 ( @entity74 ) and other animal rights groups organized a rally sunday featuring semi-nude protesters covered in red paint in @entity11 , but also have staged protests outside @entity5 embassies around the world			1
the tactics may be gaining some traction			0
a 2006 @entity85 poll showed more than 70 percent of those surveyed said they have " no interest " in bullfighting , while 82 percent of those aged 15 to 24 held that same view			0
and now the tradition has begun facing legal and political challenges			1
the government in the northeastern @entity5 region of @entity96 plans to hold a vote on banning the practice , potentially making it the second region in @entity5 to outlaw bullfighting after the @entity101 in the @entity102 did so in 1991			1
while @entity11 embraces tradition , one thing you wo n't be seeing -- or hearing -- this year ... the incessant buzz of the " vuvuzela ! " the government there has banned the sale of the plastic horns along the bull - run route , saying they would be dangerous and distracting to the animals .			1

400 - year - old tradition facing challenges on many fronts
economic downturn means fewer spectators in the arenas
animal - rights groups have held protests
@entity96 government is voting on a ban
