-- when @entity2 took office in 2009 , it was clear that if he could do four big things , his presidency would probably be judged a success			1
the first , of course , was to pull the country out of its desperate economic crisis			0
the second was to extricate it from the @entity13			0
the third was to finally achieve comprehensive health care reform			0
and the fourth was to make meaningful progress on arresting global warming			0
this last challenge was in some ways easiest to ignore : while you were shoveling snow last month , you probably did n't feel the urgency of climate change , though according to the @entity26 , it was in fact the fourth - hottest january since record - keeping began			1
but over time , it could prove more consequential than the other three combined			0
five years later , @entity2 's record on it is a mixed one			1
he wo n't get any significant legislation on the matter passed through this @entity35 -- or any legislation at all , to be honest			1
but using the power of the presidency , he may just have a bigger impact on global warming than most anyone predicted			2
that 's the good news			0
the bad news is , it almost certainly wo n't be enough			1
it 's easy to forget how the political environment has changed compared with just a few years ago			0
before @entity2 took office , it looked as though @entity49 and @entity50 might work together to do something about climate change			1
sen. @entity53 had sponsored a bill to create a cap and trade system for carbon emissions , which at the time was considered a conservative solution to the problem , as it utilized market forces to control emissions			0
many other prominent @entity50 supported cap and trade as well			2
in 2008 , @entity66 and @entity67 starred together in an ad imploring the country to address climate change			1
yet today , opposition to doing anything about climate change has become the default @entity50 position			1
even though many rank - and - file republicans understand that the planet is warming , the @entity76 view has come to dominate their party			0
climate denialism approaches the status of gospel truth among many @entity50 in @entity35 , and it 's echoed regularly on the major conservative media outlets , from @entity85 to the most popular talk radio hosts like @entity87 and @entity88			1
as hatred of @entity2 and anything he touches has become the single highest @entity50 value , there is zero chance that they will join in any effort to address climate change			1
this has left the administration with two choices : do nothing or use the executive branch 's regulatory power to reduce carbon emissions wherever it could			1
it chose the second path			0
the administration 's latest move , which the president announced tuesday , is a new measure mandating an increase in fuel efficiency for medium - and heavy - duty trucks , which account for 20 % of carbon emissions from transportation despite making up only 4 % of all vehicles on the road			2
this follows on a truly historic regulation the administration created in 2012 , which will double fuel efficiency for passenger cars by 2025 , to an average of 54.5 miles per gallon			2
and few people remember how much the 2009 stimulus bill focused on climate change			1
@entity128 's @entity127 , who wrote a book about the bill , argues that it was the largest green initiative in @entity133 history , pouring $ 90 billion into clean energy technologies , energy efficiency , upgrades to the electrical grid and a whole host of other efforts that could have a significant impact on carbon emissions over time			0
in 2009 , the @entity142 officially made it policy to treat carbon emissions as a danger to human health and thus subject to its regulation			0
this january , the @entity142 published emission standards for new power plants that make it all but impossible for coal plants to be built ( even though few coal plants were planned , given the recent natural gas boom )			2
its next task is to set new limits for the existing power plants that account for so much of our emissions			2
finally , it 's clear that climate change will play a significant role in the administration 's foreign policy efforts during @entity2 's second term			1
secretary of state @entity165 has long been an advocate for action , and as he told an audience in @entity169 , climate change is a threat as great as terrorism , poverty or weapons proliferation			1
@entity133 efforts to reduce emissions will be for naught if other countries do n't take action as well -- @entity179 passed the @entity133 a few years ago to become the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and continues to build coal plants at a furious pace -- and @entity165 's tenure will be judged in no small part by how much progress he can make in this area			0
that all sounds like relatively good news			0
the administration has worked on many fronts to reduce carbon emissions , which have declined in three out of the five years @entity2 has been in office			1
that 's in part due to the fracking boom that has made natural gas competitive with coal , but many of the administration 's steps could yield significant long - term benefits			2
even so , these measures will get us only a fraction of the distance we need to go in order to make a real impact on climate change			1
ask a climate scientist , and you 'll get a depressing take on our future , where things like moving from coal to natural gas do only the tiniest bit to delay what could be catastrophic consequences of climate change in decades to come			1
@entity26 has also noted that 2013 tied for the fourth - hottest year on record			0
so we can give @entity2 credit for what he 's done , and he should certainly keep trying to do more , even in the face of unceasing opposition from @entity50 and well - heeled interest groups			1
@entity230 , as the old saying has it , is the art of the possible			0
truly fixing the problem in a comprehensive way , given our current political environment , may never have been possible			0
years from now , we 're likely to look back and say that @entity2 gave it a good shot			2
but it was n't nearly enough			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			2

@entity239 says @entity2 wo n't get climate change legislation through @entity35
opposition to anything on the issue has become default @entity50 position , he says
administration is left to do what it can through regulatory power , he writes
@entity239 says that unfortunately , it wo n't be enough in the long run
