-- remember @entity1 from @entity2 ? he took the internet by storm this week with his good looks and strong work ethic , causing many to swoon and others to curse the power of social media			1
now a tech startup is claiming responsibility for making # alexfromtarget one of the " most amazing social media experiments ever			1
" but it 's unclear whether the company really deserves the credit			2
the ceo of @entity17 , a company that claims to connect " fans with their fandom , " said in a @entity22 post tuesday that the company harnessed social media 's " powerful fangirl demographic " to make @entity25 , a real , 16 - year - old @entity2 employee from @entity26 , a global trending topic			1
according to @entity28 , the company took the photo of @entity25 that was posted by a @entity31 user named @entity32 ( @ auscalum ) and fanned @entity31 's flames , " spreading the word amongst our fangirl followers to trend # @entity36			0
" the company says it then added " fuel to the fire by tweeting about it to our bigger @entity41 influencers			0
" the conversation then spread through people supporting the hashtag " just to trend it " and others raging over the fact that a guy could become " @entity3 famous " just for his looks , @entity17 ceo @entity43 said			1
people tweeted parody images and created @entity41 videos while the media , including @entity0 , published stories about it			0
" it was based on looks , " @entity43 told @entity0 late tuesday			0
" you put a good looking guy in front of girls , girls are going to go crazy over him			0
" but not everyone 's buying @entity28 's trending power			0
many have raised an interesting question : is n't revealing the " man behind the curtain , " so to speak , a giant no - no in the social media world ? adding to the confusion are @entity1 and @entity32 themselves			1
the " fangirl " @entity71 credited with boosting the trend and " @entity73 " both posted on @entity31 that they have no connection to @entity17			1
@entity28 later clarified that @entity32 's not an employee , but simply a @entity31 user whose tweet the company claims to have amplified			2
that backtracking is just one reason why @entity82 , who claims to be one of the largest social media influencers on @entity31 , is also skeptical about @entity28 's involvement			0
" @entity17 is already backing down on their claims and is trying to make it clear that they never employed @ auscalum , " @entity82 wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			1
" @entity17 is extremely vague on their actual relationship with her , alex , or what influence they actually had			2
" @entity82 says # @entity93 really started trending when @ @entity94 tweeted it out			2
the account has nearly 5 million followers , and the photo was retweeted more than 20,000 times , and favorited by 44,000 people .			0
