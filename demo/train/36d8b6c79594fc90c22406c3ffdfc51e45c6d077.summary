-- the recent flotilla incident is the culmination of a steep decline in @entity6 - @entity5 relations that started with the @entity8 war in 2008 and 2009			1
relations between these two countries , after reaching a high point in the late 1990s and early 2000s , are now beyond repair , and it will probably take the better part of a decade for them to be resuscitated			0
@entity5 has also used its increasingly rancorous disputes with @entity6 to advance its status in the @entity18 at the expense of traditional leaders across the region			1
@entity5 's ruling @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , which came to power in 2002 , was always conflicted in its relations with @entity6			1
the party emerged from a hardcore anti-western and anti-israeli @entity27 tradition that had close ties to @entity30 and @entity32 's @entity31			0
as it rose to power , however , the @entity22 distanced itself from these positions and even embraced the idea of joining the @entity36			0
still , it always maintained a critical stance when it came to @entity6 that was punctuated by occasional outbursts			0
@entity5 's relations with @entity6 improved when the @entity22 stepped into the vacuum created in the @entity18 by the @entity43 administration 's policies and orchestrated secret negotiations between @entity6 and @entity45			1
this effort fit well with the @entity22 's grand vision of its foreign policy -- prime minister @entity49 and his party were intent in making @entity5 an important international player			2
after punching below its weight for far too long , @entity52 thought now was the time to engage in an activist policy and capitalize on its economic prowess and strategic geopolitical location			0
it aggressively sought a role in international institutions such as the @entity60 and engaged in all kinds of diplomatic efforts from the @entity18 to the @entity63 and the @entity64			0
@entity49 and @entity5 received many kudos for the @entity6 - @entity45 talks			1
but they came to an abrupt end with @entity6 's @entity8 war			1
@entity49 felt personally betrayed by then - @entity6 prime minister @entity70 , who was in @entity52 four days before launching the @entity8 offensive			1
from then on , @entity5 foreign policy vis - Ã  - vis @entity6 was dramatically transformed			1
we first saw this at the january 2009 @entity76 meetings in @entity77 when @entity49 publicly confronted @entity6 's president @entity78 and then walked off the stage			2
positive reactions to his behavior in @entity5 and in the @entity18 provided @entity49 with the contours of @entity52 's new foreign policy			2
from then on , in almost every foreign policy speech , @entity49 would disparage @entity6 's policy in @entity8 , calling the @entity8 an open prison			1
he then began to challenge @entity6 's nuclear arms while defending @entity89 against the @entity90			1
in a deliberate obfuscation of the issues , he argued that instead of criticizing @entity89 's peaceful nuclear program , it was @entity6 's not - so - secret nuclear arsenal that ought to be the object of censure			1
this , of course , is a distortion of the truth as @entity89 was accused of violating the @entity100 , of which it is a signatory while @entity6 is not			1
his singling out of @entity6 was purposeful but unfair ; he never criticized @entity5 ally @entity103 -- or @entity105 for that matter -- for having tested and deployed nuclear arms			2
the flotilla crisis occurred in this atmosphere of great tension			0
@entity5 foreign minister @entity111 claims his government cautioned the @entity27 charity that organized the flotilla not to cross into @entity6 waters and that they were powerless to prevent an independent , non-government organization ( @entity117 ) from acting on its own volition			1
yet there are many signs that the @entity22 and other @entity5 @entity27 parties were fully supportive of the @entity117 and its efforts			2
@entity30 itself interpreted the action as an @entity49 - led effort to breach the naval blockade of @entity8			2
no one , including the @entity6 , could have anticipated the extent of the fallout , although a cursory look at what the organizers were claiming should have made it obvious that the @entity117 was clearly trying to provoke @entity6 and elicit an strong response			0
ultimately , it is the incompetence of the @entity6 decision - makers who failed to properly analyze the groups ' intentions that in many ways handed the @entity22 , @entity49 and @entity30 a public relations victory			0
@entity49 has now become a hero in the @entity145 street			0
in two years , he has managed to do what few @entity145 leaders could do -- push @entity6 into a corner			0
even though @entity145 countries have been mistrustful of @entity5 in the past , @entity49 has successfully transformed himself into the leader of the @entity18			0
he is not just the defender of traditional @entity145 concerns but also of @entity89 , as he is resisting the @entity155 administration 's efforts to impose sanctions on @entity89			2
the emerging hostility in @entity6 - @entity5 relations puts the @entity159 in a difficult quandary			1
@entity161 does not want to side with one ally over another , and @entity5 has aggressively been pushing the @entity159 to do just that			0
@entity161 , however , has issues with both countries			0
it is upset at @entity5 efforts to protect @entity89 from further @entity60 sanctions and at @entity6 for making its regional diplomacy so much more difficult , not only with the flotilla fiasco but also with its hard line on the settlements and negotiations with the @entity175			1
@entity5 may therefore emerge as an even more significant factor in an already complicated @entity18 political tapestry			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			0

@entity5 's relations with @entity6 have grown increasingly tense , says @entity183
@entity180 says @entity5 made sharp break with @entity6 because of the @entity8 conflict
he says @entity5 political parties were supportive of charity that organized flotilla
@entity180 : @entity5 gains support by opposing @entity6 blockade , sanctions against @entity89
