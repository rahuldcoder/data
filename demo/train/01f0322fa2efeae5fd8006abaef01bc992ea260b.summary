for 13 years , president @entity0 has governed @entity1			1
for 2Â½ of those years he 's faced repeated calls from many inside and outside the country for his resignation			1
now , @entity0 's regime is thought by many @entity7 governments to have used chemical weapons against its own people , prompting talk of international military intervention			1
but @entity1 's president shows no sign of stepping back from the brink of confrontation			1
so who is @entity0 and what might he do next ? when @entity0 succeeded his father @entity19 in 2000 , there was the promise of a modern and more democratic @entity1			1
in his inauguration speech , @entity0 indicated he would be a very different kind of leader to his father			1
" i shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfills the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people , " he said			0
and for a while that promise was kept			0
his official website says he has built free - trade zones , licensed more private newspapers and private universities , and fought government waste and corruption			0
he has also worked on social and economic reform			0
low profile for @entity1 's first lady but many say @entity0 's promises have largely not been delivered			1
@entity43 called his first 10 years as president " the wasted decade , " with a media that remained controlled by the state , a monitored and censored @entity47 and prisons still filled with dissidents			2
back in 2011 , @entity0 drew criticism from around the globe as he met popular protests and unrest with force			1
since then , the conflict has escalated into a brutal civil war and the rebels have at times threatened government strongholds in @entity60			0
through it all , @entity0 and his government have consistently said that its forces are targeting armed terrorists funded by outside agitators			1
and the president has shown no sign that he will accede to demands that he stand down and quit the country			2
in november last year , he told @entity71 : " i am @entity1			1
i was made in @entity1 and to live and die in @entity1			1
" over time , his public appearances have become rare events			0
but an @entity75 account set up on july 24 offers an alternative vision of the president 's life -- one that is all about feeding the hungry , science olympiads and widespread support for @entity0 and his wife , @entity82			1
the closest it comes to reflecting the ongoing war are pictures of the president meeting " with the armed forces who are fighting the terrorist groups			2
" @entity90 , a senior fellow at the @entity91 , describes @entity0 as " a master of deception " -- and his manipulation of the media is one part of that			1
" i think that the regime -- the package of @entity0 and his wife @entity82 , it 's very seductive			1
and it draws you -- how could someone who seems so reasonable command such a horrific regime ? " said @entity90			0
and if the threat of @entity7 military intervention in @entity1 is borne out , @entity0 's response may not be an obvious one , he said			1
" he 's going to think about , ' how am i going to react to these strikes ? ' now what we can see from past strikes by the @entity117 is that actually @entity0 does very , very little in terms of a direct response			1
but over time , he might carry out other kinds of attacks on @entity123 assets			0
" a brutal war ? not to hear @entity0 's @entity75 tell it ' victim of cruelty ' two former regime insiders -- now its opponents -- told @entity130 of their time with the younger @entity0			1
former vice president @entity132 said @entity0 was often the victim of his elder brother 's cruelty			1
" his brother @entity135 bullied him as a child			0
his father never gave him as much attention as @entity135 , " @entity132 said			0
@entity140 's uncle @entity139 , who left @entity1 in 1984 after being involved in a failed coup , also recalled the future president			1
" he is very different than his father			0
@entity19 was a leader , the head of the entire regime , while @entity0 was never that close to being one and never fell within that framework			1
he is being perceived as the leader but he follows what the regime decides on his behalf			0
" @entity140 himself said reform faltered because of unrest in neighboring states -- @entity153 and @entity154			1
but @entity132 , who was vice president under both @entity0 and his father , says the younger @entity0 is both brutal and indecisive			1
" @entity0 's problem is that he listens to everything but denies and forgets quickly			2
you discuss an issue with him in the morning and another person comes along and changes his mind			0
" politically , @entity0 does not have a consistent ideology ; he changes his opinion according to his interests and that of the regime			2
" and the regime is a family affair			0
@entity140 's younger brother @entity169 commands an elite division of the army , and is accused of widespread human rights abuses			2
his cousin @entity173 is the richest man in @entity1			2
the @entity174 belong to @entity1 's @entity176 minority , who according to the president 's uncle @entity139 , are driven by fears they could be overwhelmed			1
" there is no doubt that the @entity176 are a minority who are in fear of the outcome and they are driven by that fear factor , " he said			0
' not my forces ' despite the brutal crackdown in @entity1 , @entity0 has maintained that he is not in charge of @entity1 's military			1
he told @entity194 's @entity193 in 2011 : " they are not my forces			0
they are forces for the government			0
i do n't own them			0
i do n't own the country			0
so they are not my forces			0
" would n't @entity0 , the commander in chief , have had to give the order for any military actions ? " no , no no , " he said			2
not by your command ? " no , " he said , " on no one 's command			0
there was no command to kill or to be brutal			0
" @entity140 said those members of the armed forces who " went too far " had been disciplined			2
but @entity132 , the former vice president , expressed no doubts about who does give the orders to kill : " @entity0 and no one else			1
he gives out orders to use all means of force to crush the revolution			0
he is surrounded by close aides and a security apparatus that advise him , but he decides			0
" it was n't expected that @entity0 would carry on the family 's political dynasty			2
he did n't seem to have the personality for the job ; he was n't deeply involved in military or government matters , according to " inheriting @entity1 : @entity0 's @entity228 , " a biography by @entity230 , who worked as an expert on @entity1 for the @entity232 in the 1990s and was the senior director for @entity235 affairs at the @entity236 in the early 2000s			1
because his older brother @entity135 was expected to succeed his father , @entity0 went to @entity239 in the 1990s and studied ophthalmology , and headed the @entity241			2
" dr. @entity0 , " as he was widely known , liked to windsurf and play volleyball			2
he is believed to have started dating @entity244 - born @entity243 during this time			0
but @entity0 was called back to @entity1 in 1994 when @entity135 died in a car wreck			1
this turn of events made him first in line to rule @entity1 , and he was appointed president by @entity1 's rubber - stamp @entity250 in 2000 after his father died			1
before 2000 ended , he and @entity82 were married			0
steps toward change ? shortly after the @entity256 started in early 2011 , @entity0 made apparent moves toward change in @entity1			1
initially , protesters wanted basic reforms , more freedoms , a multiparty political system and an end to emergency law			0
some of these measures were , on paper , implemented by @entity0 , but they were far too little and , by the time they came about , too late			2
in a speech in january 2013 , @entity0 laid out his latest solution to the ongoing crisis in @entity1			1
he said he wanted to foster national dialogue and proposed a new constitution that would be put up for a public referendum			0
he also said he would not negotiate with terrorists and asked regional governments to stop supporting them			0
months later , though , any chance of finding a political solution seems as remote as ever			0
a date has yet to be agreed for a second international meeting on @entity1 in @entity281 , @entity282 , initially proposed for june			2
after more than two years of violence and more than 100,000 deaths , many opposition supporters have lost any faith they ever had in @entity0 's ability to deliver reform , and simply want an end to his rule and true democratic elections			2
but the president 's days at the helm may be far from over .			0

@entity0 has been president of @entity1 since 2000
he has faced calls from many inside and outside @entity1 to resign
" i was made in @entity1 and to live and die in @entity1 , " he said last year
@entity140 is a " master of deception " says one *analyst*
