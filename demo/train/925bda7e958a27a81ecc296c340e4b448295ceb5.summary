@entity0 -- when @entity2 walks in to our @entity0 office she arrives accompanied by her 17 - year - old son and her brother			1
where she is from , in @entity10 's tribal border region close to @entity11 , it would be unthinkable if she did n't have male relatives with her			1
even so i am struck that while campaigning for one of the most powerful jobs in the land , to be a member of @entity18 , she is hobbled in a way no male candidate will be			1
as she puts it , " as a woman it 's hard because women are helpless and men are more confident so they have an advantage and can do anything			2
" despite the strictures on her life , she has respect for her roots			0
when we first talk she begins her opening remarks , " @entity33 , " in the name of @entity35			0
it is a sign of respect for all she has grown up with			0
nevertheless her campaign to be the first female representative from her tribal region is against the current of its conservative tribal and religious culture which , for the most part , relegates women to a life of relative drudgery , child - rearing and cooking			1
her own experiences are a little different			0
in the mountainous region of @entity53 where she is from she is the one in her family who draws water from the well at their house			2
she alone cooks the family food over an open fire in the yard , and when it 's all done she alone washes the dishes while crouching in the dirt			1
it is a heritage that is holding back so many of @entity2 's contemporaries , but not her			1
i want " to give women their rights , the rights that they deserve , i have come out to help people and help the poor people , " she tells me			1
after just a short conversation it is easy to see why she above others might be willing to raise herself up			0
there is a strength and determination about her which she is all too aware she will need			0
" @entity53 is very conservative , but i came out because i wanted things to get better , so there can be peace , and end unemployment and to do something for our country			0
" it is a risky campaign made more dangerous by the @entity87			0
where she comes from in @entity53 , they are never far away and she is challenging all that they stand for			0
the @entity87 do n't want to see women educated , they want a status quo , even a regression where women will have a lesser role than @entity97 children			2
back then children were at least seen if not heard , the @entity87 -- if they could -- would silence women forever and confine them to their homes			2
but @entity2 sees what 's happening in @entity10 's bigger cities where women have even become government ministers			1
" the times have changed , there 's a lot of progress , women are coming out , and going to school , going to their jobs			2
some are engineers , some work with computers , some are teachers			0
" her campaign is a tough one , a seven - year veteran of cricket star - turned - politician @entity121 's party , she had hoped to be picked to represent him in the region			2
instead that pick went to a man			0
@entity121 's party officials tell me they have to respect candidates who 've been with the fledgling party longest and put them forward			2
@entity2 fears backhanders have been paid by the other candidate so he can benefit from the boost party backing will undoubtedly bring him			1
the facts may never be known			0
@entity121 's party is fighting in part on an anti-corruption ticket but if @entity2 struggles to win the support of @entity121 's party , which prides itself as progressive and pushing women 's issues , it shows @entity2 's fight is far from done			1
if she does make it to elected office , she knows exactly where to start to turn her region 's centuries - old attitudes to women			1
" with education they can look after their children and do something for their people and country , moving forward			0
" today , where @entity2 stands , that seems like a long shot , but in a generation , if she gets her way , old attitudes could fade and women assume a fuller role in shaping @entity10 's future .			1

@entity2 the first female *parliamentary* candidate from her tribal region
she 's campaigning for election but must still be accompanied by a male family member
@entity10 polls open on *saturday* after campaigning marred by *violence*
@entity2 wants " to give women their rights , the rights that they deserve "
