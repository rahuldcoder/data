he was set to get such training -- which is required within six months of one 's start date -- after becoming mayor , but the trainer canceled the session and never rescheduled , according to the lawyer			2
@entity3 wo n't pay for mayor 's defense " there is very , very good reason for mandatory sexual harassment training , " @entity14 said			1
" if nothing else , it makes people think about the subject and how they interact with fellow employees			0
" while the mayor has admitted unspecified inappropriate behavior in the past , he denies the allegations against him by @entity63			0
" this is not a request for the city to agree to pay any verdict ; it is simply a request for defense against unverified claims being brought against the mayor -- claims which are denied , " @entity14 said			2

" @entity2 ca n't pay back @entity127 for the damage he 's done to our city 's reputation , but he can and should repay the city if there are any taxpayer costs as a result of this lawsuit , " @entity39 said in a statement			2
