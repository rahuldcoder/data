with one 4Â½ - hour flight friday , the new spacecraft series that @entity1 hopes will take astronauts to @entity5 passed its first test above @entity7			1
@entity1 's @entity9 capsule -- part of @entity12 's bid to take crews beyond low - earth orbit for the first time since the @entity17 missions -- splashed down in the @entity18 on friday morning after lapping the planet twice on an uncrewed test flight			1
the cone - shaped craft , slowed by a series of parachutes , settled onto the water at 8:29 a.m. @entity25 ( 11:29 a.m. et ) about 600 miles southwest of @entity26			1
" @entity12 has driven a golden spike as it crosses a bridge into the future , " a @entity1 announcer said as the capsule bobbed on the ocean 's surface during the agency 's tv broadcast of the event			0
the flight took @entity9 farther from @entity7 than any craft designed for human flight since the @entity41 mission to the moon in 1972 -- a confidence builder for a program that @entity1 hopes will take its first human crew into space in 2021			1
" it appears that @entity9 and the @entity50 ( rocket ) were nearly flawless , " program manager @entity47 told reporters			1
@entity9 , a crew module designed to carry up to six astronauts , soared into the @entity55 sky at 7:05 a.m. et from @entity56 atop a @entity50 rocket			1
the assembly shed its boosters before the rocket 's second stage lifted @entity9 into low - @entity7 orbit in minutes			1
two hours later , a milestone : the second stage lifted @entity9 higher for its second orbit , about 3,600 miles above @entity7 , or 15 times higher than the @entity66			1
" a human - rated system has n't gone that far since 1972			1
... that reminded us that here we are again , now , the @entity12 leading exploration out into the solar system , " @entity47 said			0
after the splashdown , crews from two @entity74 recovery ships were working to collect the craft			0
it was a crucial test for the capsule : @entity1 wants to prove flight and re-entry abilities before it carries astronauts			1
@entity83 : @entity1 's @entity5 milestone beyond the moon the @entity9 crew module , which looks like a throwback to the @entity17 era , but roomier , could take astronauts back to the moon , but also far beyond			1
related : thousands of spaceships could colonize @entity5 one of @entity9 's tasks might be to send astronauts to an asteroid -- perhaps one that @entity1 would first robotically redirect to orbit around the moon			2
@entity1 says it hopes that @entity9 , pushed by a more powerful rocket system under development , will send astronauts to an asteroid in the 2020s			2
@entity1 hopes @entity9 later will send astronauts to @entity5 ' moons , and , eventually , to the @entity5 itself			2
while @entity1 focuses on deeper space , private space companies such as @entity105 are expected to take over the space shuttles ' old job of ferrying astronauts and supplies to the @entity66 in low - @entity7 orbit			2
when it becomes fully operational , @entity9 's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21 - day mission into deep space , or six astronauts for shorter missions			2
by comparison , the @entity17 crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days			0
@entity9 's crew module is 16.5 feet in diameter and @entity17 was 12.8 feet in diameter , @entity1 said			2
data to sift friday 's launch came a day after @entity1 scrubbed its first attempt because of a failure of some valves in the boosters to close			2
those valves , which allow fuel to flow into the boosters before launch , are supposed to close just before liftoff			0
engineers and scientists will examine all sorts of data -- including those collected by on - board recorders -- to determine how well the capsule performed friday			0
this includes how well the heat shield -- which keeps the capsule from burning up on re-entry -- held up			0
" we know it worked , " @entity47 said , " but the specifics of how well ... will take time to investigate			0
" though @entity9 's first flight did n't have people on it , it did n't go up empty			1
it carried the names of more than a million people packed on a dime - sized microchip			0
" @entity160 " sent up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight , including @entity157 's cookie and @entity159 's rubber ducky			0
also aboard : an oxygen hose from an @entity163 lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil			0
a tyrannosaurus rex fossil from the @entity167 made the trip , and lockers were filled with flags , coins , patches , poetry and music			0
