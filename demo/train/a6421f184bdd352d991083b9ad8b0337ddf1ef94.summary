@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 said tuesday that it would release an unspecified number of prisoners in february to mark the birthdays of the two dictators who ruled the reclusive nation for a total of more than 60 years			1
the amnesty of " convicts , " ordered by a parliamentary decree , will begin february 1 , the state - run @entity13 ( @entity13 ) reported			0
@entity13 said the move ties in with the centenary of the birth of @entity17 , the revered founder of @entity3 who ran the country between 1945 and 1994 , and the 70th birthday of his son , @entity21 , who succeeded him and remained in power until his death last month			1
leadership of the repressive regime has now passed to a third generation of the @entity21 family : @entity28 , the youngest son and chosen successor of @entity21			0
@entity3 tends to grant amnesties to prisoners at five - year intervals after an important date , like the founding of the @entity35 , according to @entity36 , the president of @entity38 , an internet news company that monitors developments in @entity3 from @entity0			1
but the centennial of @entity17 's birthday , for which huge commemorations are expected , could result in a particularly large release of prisoners , @entity41 said			0
in any year , @entity17 's birthday on april 15 , known as the " @entity48 , " is one of the biggest dates in the @entity3 calendar			2
his 100th birthday , combined with the 70th anniversary of the birth of @entity21 on february 16 , is likely to considerably intensify the regime 's commemorative efforts			0
but @entity41 cautioned that whatever the scale of this year 's amnesty , which is unlikely to include a high proportion of political prisoners , he does not think it will represent an improvement in @entity3 's human rights record			1
" we have had heard that usually within three months , large numbers of other people get hauled into the prison camps again , " he said			0
" so in the long run , the country maintains almost the same number of prisoners consistently , aside from the one or two months immediately after the amnesty order			2
" gauging the number of people detained by @entity3 is difficult because of the regime 's secretiveness and restrictions on foreign agencies operating there			1
international organizations estimate that @entity3 holds about 200,000 political prisoners			1
@entity41 said that he believed the overall prison population to be between 300,000 and 400,000			0
@entity3 is estimated to have a total population of about 23 million people			2
