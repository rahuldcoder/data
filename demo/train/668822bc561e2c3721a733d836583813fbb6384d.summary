-- @entity1 turns 7 on thursday , and in some ways , it 's like a lot of 7 - year - olds			1
the social - media platform can be bratty and combative			0
its idea of a good conversation sometimes devolves into short bursts of shouting			0
it can have the attention span of a gnat , loving a shiny new plaything one day ( ooh , @entity17 's @entity16 ! ) and then forsaking it for another without a second thought			1
but it can also make you smile with the things it says			0
it can keep you more aware , and alert , than you 've ever been before			0
and it can make you look at the world around you in a different way			0
it 's easy to take shots at the microblogging site , which debuted march 21 , 2006 , when founder @entity31 typed the words " just setting up my twttr			1
" ( @entity34 had considered that abbreviated style for the company 's name before settling on the full word			1
) anything with more than 200 million users who send out 400 million posts every day is going to have highs and lows			1
there are the silly trending hashtags , the badly spelled diatribes and , yes , as the cliched insult goes , even a few people who really do tweet about what they had for breakfast			0
@entity1 founder wants to be @entity54 mayor but @entity1 has also been a crucial tool for revolutionaries in @entity57 , @entity58 and elsewhere			1
it 's been used to mobilize relief efforts and raise millions for charitable causes			1
it 's become a national water cooler for chatter about big televised events such as the @entity64 and the @entity65			2
and while @entity1 sometimes reveals the stupid side of celebrity culture , it 's also brought fans closer to their favorite actors , musicians , writers and athletes than was ever possible before			1
@entity1 has , in fact , changed lives			1
so , in honor of its 7th birthday , we look at both the upside and the downside of @entity1 use through seven people whose lives were changed by the site			1
@entity84 if you do n't know that @entity84 sometimes tells inappropriate jokes , then you probably have n't heard of @entity84			0
after all , this is the guy who once performed the nearly impossible task of offending the crowd at a @entity92 's @entity91 with a joke soon after 9/11			2
so , when a tsunami hit @entity95 in 2011 , @entity84 did what he does : make jokes about it			0
" i was talking to my @entity95 real estate agent			0
i said ' is there a school in this area ? ' she said ' not now , but just wait , ' " went one			0
about an hour later , the comedian had lost his high - profile job as the grating voice of the @entity108 duck			0
in an opinion piece for @entity0 last year ( about another comedy controversy , no less ) , @entity84 wrote that it 's a comedian 's job to push boundaries and that @entity108 should n't have been surprised at the tweets			1
" i 've been telling jokes like this for a very long time , so the reaction surprised me , " he wrote			0
" it 's like eating @entity119 every day for years , and then one day you eat @entity119 and all hell breaks loose			2
" @entity122 @entity123 was a suburban mom from @entity125 , @entity126 , who took to @entity1 as an outlet for her wry observations on life			1
more than 450,000 followers later , she can add author and screenwriter to her credits			0
her sardonic humor , with topics ranging from family life ( " how do you get a red wine stain off a baby ? " ) to random observations ( " that ninja guy in the @entity143 has probably killed 64 people , right ? " ) , gained her a following that includes @entity146 stars and other notables like talk - show host @entity148 ( now a friend ) and film critic @entity151			0
now she 's sold her first screenplay , " @entity154 , " to @entity153 ; her book of essays , " everything 's @entity158 , " is set to be released next month ; and she 's been hired to write a tv pilot			1
@entity160 his dad says funny stuff			0
or , more accurately , funny sh * t. ( sorry , that 's as close as we can get )			2
so he created the @entity1 account " @entity169 " in 2009 to share it with the world			1
two months later , he had millions of followers ( the count now sits at 3.1 million ) and a book deal with @entity173			2
that book hit no. 1 on the @entity177 bestseller list and led to a short - lived @entity179 sitcom , " $ # * ! my dad says , " starring @entity181			2
@entity160 still tweets out his dad 's best moments			1
his second book , " i suck at girls , " was published last may			2
@entity186 @entity186 was a 33 - year - old " it consultant taking a break from the rat race by hiding in the mountains with his laptops , " according to his @entity1 profile			1
that spot in the mountains was in @entity194 , @entity195 , and on may 2 , 2011 , he tweeted about a curiosity			0
" helicopter hovering over @entity194 at 1am ( is rare event ) , " he wrote			0
little did he know that , over the course of the next few hours , he 'd become possibly the world 's first person to unknowingly report on the death of terrorist @entity203 at the hands of a @entity206 navy seal team			2
all of a sudden , news outlets from around the world were scrambling for interviews with him			0
his modest 750 @entity1 followers ballooned to more than 105,000 ( they 've since settled back to about 64,000 )			1
he continues to tweet from @entity194 but has traveled extensively , including accepting an invitation to tell his story at last year 's @entity215 festival in @entity216 , @entity217			2
@entity218 he claimed that he was hacked , and at first , some of us believed him			0
after all , could a @entity206 congressman be so clueless ? turns out ... in june 2011 , then - @entity54 rep. @entity218 resigned after someone used his @entity1 account to send suggestive photos to some of his female followers			1
at first , he lied , saying he 'd been hacked			0
but after a couple of frantic days , @entity218 fessed up that he had been having inappropriate online relationships with women he met through social networking sites			0
how early @entity1 decisions led to @entity218 's downfall he , perhaps wisely , also quit @entity1 for a while			1
his first post since the scandal was in november , when he tweeted about @entity236			2
the potential @entity54 mayoral candidate 's most recent tweet , from february , suggests that he still may not have gotten the hang of the whole @entity1 thing			1
" @entity242 @ , " it reads			0
@entity243 a @entity245 triple jumper , @entity243 was hours away from realizing her dream of becoming an @entity247			0
then , on her way to last year 's @entity249 , she tweeted a joke : " with so many @entity253 in @entity245 , the mosquitoes from the @entity252 will at least be eating some homemade food			2
" maybe it was supposed to be some kind of play on words			0
but it was quickly denounced as racially insensitive , or downright racist , by @entity1 users			1
@entity245 's @entity262 committee condemned the tweet and ruled that she would not be allowed to participate in the games			2
for what it 's worth , @entity243 's last tweet , from july 25 , expressed " heartfelt apologies " for the joke , saying she " could never believe in discrimination between human beings and races			0
" @entity274 sure , @entity274 was already a tv and movie star when @entity1 started up			1
but he became the first @entity1 celebrity after joining in january 2009 , when the site was getting ready to make the leap from tech - savvy coffeehouse to household name			1
he got tons of publicity for becoming the site 's first user with 1 million followers -- a distinction he won after winning a race to seven figures with some news network called @entity0			1
he also became a savvy investor in tech startups			0
but perhaps more importantly than sheer numbers -- he 's now 23rd on the site 's popularity list , with almost 14 million followers -- @entity274 seemed to be the first celebrity who understood the benefits of using @entity1 to interact with fans .			1

on @entity1 's seventh *anniversary* , a look at seven lives changed by the site
everyday users have gotten book deals and tv shows *due* to their tweets
but politicians , *entertainers* and athletes have fallen after bad @entity1 decisions
@entity1 started on march 21 , 2006 , with a test post from founder @entity31
