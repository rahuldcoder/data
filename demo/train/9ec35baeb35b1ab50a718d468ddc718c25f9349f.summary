-- it was a fitting end to a remarkable era -- @entity3 celebrated his final home game as manager of @entity6 with a dramatic late victory against @entity8 on sunday			1
while the result made no difference to either side 's season , the jubilation that followed a rare winner from veteran defender @entity11 brought echoes from some of the 71 - year - old 's long list of triumphs in more than quarter of a century at the helm			0
" my retirement does n't mean the end of my life at the club			0
i will be able to enjoy watching them rather than suffering with them , " @entity3 told the crowd in pouring rain at @entity29 , which included his 11 grandchildren in the stands			2
" but if you think about it , those last - minute goals , comebacks , even the defeats , are all part of this great football club of ours			2
it 's been an unbelievable experience so thank you for that			0
" i 'd also like to remind you that when we had bad times here the club stood by me , the players stood by me , and your job now is to stand by our new manager			0
" @entity3 's replacement will be @entity53 , who is leaving @entity6 's @entity55 rivals @entity54 after more than a decade as manager			1
he will begin preparations for @entity6 's title defense when he formally takes over in july , with @entity3 's legacy being 13 league championships , two @entity61 , five @entity62 , four @entity63 , one @entity64 and one @entity65			1
this season @entity6 regained the @entity55 crown from bitter rivals @entity67 , securing it with four games to play			2
" it has been the most fantastic experience of my life			0
thank you , " said @entity3 , the most successful manager in @entity72 football			1
" i have been very fortunate , i 've been able to manage some of the greatest players in the country let alone @entity6			2
" all these players here today , they have represented our club the proper way and have won a championship in fantastic fashion			0
well done to the players			0
" @entity6 took the lead six minutes before halftime through striker @entity86 , but @entity8 stunned the home fans when @entity88 volleyed in at the near post just four minutes after the interval for his 18th league goal this season			1
if the @entity94 's effort was a typically predatory strike , @entity11 's stunning 87th - minute volley came out of the blue -- the former @entity100 center - back 's first goal in more than five years			0
it also capped a home farewell for 38 - year - old midfielder @entity103 , who announced on saturday that he is retiring for the second time and will return to the club 's coaching ranks			1
" @entity103 is one of the greatest players this club has ever had and ever will have , " said @entity3 , who brought @entity103 into the first team from the youth ranks along with a " golden generation " that included @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			2
" i wish you a great retirement and i know you will still be around annoying me ! " added the @entity115 , who will remain at @entity29 as a director on the board and as a club ambassador			2
one player who did n't feature in the match was @entity100 striker @entity123 , who watched from the stands before joining the celebrations on the pitch			1
@entity3 later confirmed that @entity123 has asked to leave the club , so he thought it was best to give the 27 - year - old time to reflect on his decision			1
" i think he wants to think it through in his mind -- i think that 's a good idea			0
we 're not going to let him go , " @entity3 said			0
" i think maybe he is a bit frustrated			0
he has been taken off once or twice in the past couple of weeks			0
" @entity3 also revealed that he had made his decision to retire last december because he wanted to spend more time with his wife @entity143 , who had recently lost her sister			0
the win put @entity6 13 points clear of @entity67 ahead of @entity3 's 1,500th and final @entity6 game away to @entity148 next sunday			1
@entity67 's season suffered another setback on saturday with a 1 - 0 defeat to lowly @entity152 in the @entity154 final , which has sparked speculation that manager @entity156 will be sacked			2
while @entity67 sealed the second of @entity100 's @entity160 places last weekend , the other two are still up for grabs			0
@entity162 moved above @entity164 rivals @entity163 into fourth place with a 2 - 1 win at @entity167 on sunday , as @entity168 scored the decisive goal with seven minutes to play			1
@entity167 led early through @entity170 but @entity171 -- who set up @entity168 's winner -- equalized before the home side had @entity174 sent off just after halftime			0
@entity163 can regain fourth place with victory over @entity152 on tuesday in a match that the third - bottom team needs to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation			2
@entity181 will leave @entity54 in sixth place following a 2 - 0 win over @entity184 , with both goals coming from @entity187 striker @entity186			1
@entity188 stayed seventh with a 3 - 1 win at @entity190 as a hat - trick from striker @entity192 meant the @entity164 side may need a point in the final round to avoid relegation			1
@entity197 and @entity198 both won on sunday to ensure another season in the top flight , respectively beating bottom club @entity201 2 - 1 and eighth - placed @entity148 4 - 0			1
@entity202 could have condemned @entity152 to the drop just a day after the club 's biggest success at @entity206 , but drew 1 - 1 with @entity207 to stay in the relegation mix.			1

@entity3 farewells @entity6 fans with 2 - 1 home victory on sunday
@entity115 is retiring after more than *26* years in charge at the @entity72 *soccer* club
