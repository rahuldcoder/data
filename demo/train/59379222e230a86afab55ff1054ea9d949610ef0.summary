sounds like a morbid crime story			2
yet this tale has taken a sudden and unexpected twist : the killer got a pardon and a hero 's welcome			2
that has stirred fears of a war			2
the parole has exacerbated long - standing tensions over disputed land between @entity17 and @entity18 , former @entity20 republics that are nestled in the @entity21 near @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
the nations fought a war two decades ago over the region of @entity28 and surrounding @entity18 territories			1
much of the area is now occupied by @entity17			1
a return to warfare could suck in world powers , analysts warned wednesday			2
@entity35 , an expert on the @entity21 with the @entity36 , told @entity0 world energy markets would be disrupted in a conflict since an oil and a gas pipeline carrying @entity42 oil curves around the conflict zone in @entity18			1
mosque shooting , suicide bombing hit @entity24 's @entity21 region the ax killing happened in 2004 at a @entity49 center in @entity50 , where troops from @entity17 and @entity18 were getting training			1
@entity53 , a soldier from @entity18 , killed @entity17 officer @entity54			1
both men were studying @entity56			2
@entity53 was sentenced to life in prison in @entity50 , but that country recently extradited him to @entity18 with the understanding that he would serve at least 25 years of the sentence			1
not long after @entity53 arrived in @entity18 , though , @entity18 president @entity62 pardoned him			1
@entity17 recoiled at what happened next : the killer got an apartment and a promotion			1
" mr. @entity53 has been glorified in @entity18 as a national hero at all levels -- including the top level , " said @entity67 , @entity17 's deputy minister of foreign affairs			1
" this is a blow to the conscience of @entity73 , to the civilized world			2
" @entity18 's @entity75 said on @entity76 that the " issue must be considered in the context of aggression and ethnic cleansing against @entity18 by @entity17			1
" the @entity81 , meanwhile , was among those nations objecting to the pardon			2
it expressed " deep concern " and asked @entity50 for more information on why it extradited @entity53			1
" we are communicating to @entity18 authorities our disappointment about the decision to pardon @entity53 , " a spokesman for the @entity88 , @entity89 , said in a statement the @entity91 released			1
" this action is contrary to ongoing efforts to reduce regional tensions and promote reconciliation			0
" @entity100 , director of the @entity102 's @entity73 program , said world powers have taken note			0
" there is an awareness among government officials , both in the @entity81 , @entity24 , and among @entity73 officials , that this conflict is getting worse			0
there should be something done to stop it , " @entity100 said			0
" this takes us a whole step downward , " said the @entity36 's @entity112			0
the tensions over @entity28 reflect strong cultural attachments for both peoples , what @entity119 , visiting fellow of the @entity24 and @entity120 at the @entity121 , likens to a " @entity123 for both societies			0
" @entity125 over the disputed territory have simmered since the end of @entity128 the @entity20 's collapse in the 1990s triggered a war from 1992 to 1994 that killed 22,000 to 25,000 people and uprooted more than a million others			1
the war ended " with a shaky truce , " the @entity102 said			0
the disputes between the countries over @entity28 and other territories remain an " unresolved conflict of the @entity20 period , " @entity100 said			1
amid the creation of newly independent countries after the @entity20 collapse , she said , " no one was focused on the conflict			1
" " the kind of support for @entity151 , " whose breakup led to major wars in @entity147 and @entity148 , was " never given to this region			2
" over the years , violence has flared			0
both countries occasionally talk tough about each other			0
and @entity18 's oil and gas wealth is making its way into the budget for a military preparing for war , @entity100 said			1
" since 2011 , we feel the situation has gotten worse , " @entity100 said			0
the killer 's pardon prompted a certain outrage factor , she said			2
" people were shocked by this			0
" @entity50 defended its extradition and said it received assurances the killer would carry out his term			1
but the country criticized the " sudden and unexpected release " and called it " unacceptable			0
" @entity17 suspended its relations with @entity50			1
the disputes are unfolding in a tough neighborhood			0
@entity22 has been mired down in fighting with @entity179 rebels			0
@entity24 fought a brief war with @entity181 four years ago and has battled @entity183 insurgents in its northern @entity21 region in recent years			0
@entity23 supports @entity186 's government in its civil war			0
" @entity24 is a military ally of @entity17			1
@entity18 has strong military links with @entity22 and they ( @entity17 and @entity18 ) are both on the border with @entity23 , " @entity112 said			1
also , he said , the @entity17 - @entity81 community " will beat the drum " and push for @entity81 action			1
@entity119 said a deteriorating conflict could spawn an arms race			0
the incident reflects a lack of willingness among many citizens to compromise and get back to peacemaking , @entity119 said			0
this could play into upcoming elections , with both @entity62 and @entity17 president @entity205 seeking to look strong for the voters			1
@entity207 also wrote in a column that the @entity209 published tuesday that @entity50 negotiated the extradition " for reasons that have yet to be fully explained			2
" he called the events a " black week " for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and said it 's " now a full - blown state - to - state row , with as yet knowable consequences			0
" he cites worries that " a fanatical @entity17 will try to commit a revenge attack			2
" " from the political perspective , to call the @entity18 government 's actions a mistake is an understatement			2
it is a worrying indication of the quality of advice that president @entity62 is receiving from his inner circle			0
" @entity207 said diplomats must work harder now			0
when there is no peace process , he told @entity0 , " the vacuum is filled by war talk			0
" " if there is any silver lining to this dark episode it could be that the international community pays more attention to the dangers of a new @entity17 - @entity18 conflict over @entity28 , " de @entity35 wrote in his column			1
" the reception given @entity246 suggests that the situation is moving closer to war than peace			0
" @entity251 city aims to be ' @entity252 of the @entity21 ' @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report			0
