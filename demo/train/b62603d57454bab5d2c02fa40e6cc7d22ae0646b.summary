@entity0 -- @entity2 refuses to keep a single photo of his family in his home			1
he says it 's just too painful			0
for more than 25 years , @entity2 has lived with the guilt of knowing his wife and two daughters are being held against their will in @entity11 because of a choice he made			1
" i made such a foolish decision , " oh says , " which has caused my family to suffer such hardship in the hands of an outrageous criminal organization			1
it does n't help even if i repent , my heart is torn with sorrow			0
" oh , a native of @entity23 , moved his family to @entity24 in 1985 despite his wife 's reservations on the promise of a good job and free medical treatment for his wife 's hepatitis , but when they arrived he realized he had been tricked			1
he says there was not a job nor medical help for his wife , just three months of what he calls , " lectures from day to night on @entity11 ideology , history and brainwashing			1
" he was then forced to work in a radio station broadcasting propaganda			0
oh was sent to @entity45 the following year to lure more @entity23 to the communist state			1
but when he arrived at customs , @entity2 handed them a piece of paper asking to defect			1
held for two months in detention in @entity52 , he was questioned by different intelligence agencies , including he says the @entity54			2
he was then freed and moved to @entity23			1
but his nightmare had only just begun			0
oh learned his wife and daughters , only aged 6 and 9 when they first moved to @entity11 , were sent to a concentration camp as punishment for his defection			1
in 1991 , he received the first and last message from them			2
three black and white photos and recorded messages from his family			0
oh and the human rights workers believe they were recorded by @entity11 officials as a trap to lure him back			1
his youngest daughter says , " i miss you dad , i do n't know you and i need to grow up fast so i can help mum and i feel regret but now i can lift water buckets and wood very well			0
" studying the photos , some defectors have told oh they believe they were taken in the notorious @entity80 concentration camp			1
his eldest daughter tells him , " hi dad , it 's @entity84 , i dreamt the other day that i was celebrating my birthday with you			0
it 's been a while since i said the word father and my tears are falling			0
" on the tape , his wife wonders when she will see him again			0
@entity2 looks at the photos of his family			1
thinking back to when he first received them he shakes his head			0
" i am ... psychologically and physically , totally destroyed , " he says			0
" i have literally no feeling			0
" he says he feels helpless and all his hopes now rest with the @entity99 and the @entity23 president			1
the @entity99 body on arbitrary detention has petitioned @entity11 to release the family , saying their detention is " arbitrary , " but the response has not been positive			1
@entity24 claims @entity2 's wife has already died from her hepatitis and his daughters want nothing to do with him as they say he deserted them			1
oh refuses to believe either claim			0
@entity23 has increased diplomatic pressure on @entity24			2
president @entity113 asked the @entity115 king , @entity114 for assistance			2
@entity115 has an embassy in @entity24 and has , in the past , acted as a neutral broker for countries with no presence there			2
all @entity2 can do now is wait -- as he has for the past quarter of a century			2
and hope he will live to see his daughters freed			0
" every night i have nightmares , ' he says			0
" i 'm more than 70 years old now and exhausted but i will stay alive until i can hold my two daughters again			2
" @entity1 's @entity124 contributed to this report			0
