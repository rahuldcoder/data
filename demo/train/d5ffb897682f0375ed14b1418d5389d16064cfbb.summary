however , you can make an emergency call to a law enforcement agency , a medical provider , the fire department or other emergency services agency			0
2 ) oddly enough , you may dial your cell phone while driving , but you can not hold your cell phone and talk			1
3 ) you can get a fine for texting if the officer believes you have become distracted and are not driving safely			1
4 ) if you are using a bluetooth or other earpiece when driving , you can not cover both ears			0

how to comply so , how do you comply ? there are several options , from buying a new car with factory - installed bluetooth technology to installing aftermarket wireless products to wearing a wireless headset to abstaining altogether from using a cell phone while driving			1
@entity48 autos : 10 cars to keep you young here 's a breakdown of what you can do to become a hands - free driver : spend nothing -- either abstain from talking while driving altogether or use your cell phone 's speakerphone			1
however , most of these tiny speakers do n't deliver enough volume to mask car and road noises , leaving drivers holding their phone up to their ear			1
according to hands - free laws , this is illegal			0
also , some drivers are turning to the wired headset that most manufacturers include with your cell phone			1
@entity48 autos : used luxury cars best buys in ear wear -- although some people find ear pieces uncomfortable or way too geeky , a @entity13 - enabled ear piece is one of the best ways to drive and talk			2
@entity212 makes some of the most affordable ear pieces with good sound quality like the sleek new @entity213 ( $ 149.95 ) , the modestly - priced @entity215 ( $ 99.95 ) and the military grade @entity214 ( $ 79.95 )			0
for those into designer wear , the @entity219 ( $ 129.99 ) looks like a work of art and works as good as it looks			0
do n't want an earpiece ? -- wireless speakerphones and aftermarket - installed voice recognition systems have come of age			1
@entity230 - based @entity229 started making these systems years ago when most of @entity233 enacted hands - free laws			0
@entity229 's @entity236 ( $ 89 ) clips to your visor and is basically a mobile speakerphone while @entity229 's pluggable @entity241 ( $ 119.99 ) sticks out from your car 's cigarette lighter and has some voice recognition capabilities			0
parrot also has a host of other @entity13 - integrated products that are installed by professionals and do what factory - installed systems can do like automatically turn down your car 's audio volume when you get a call			0
bluetooth basics -- as with any new technology , there 's a ramp - up time to feeling comfortable with using wireless technology and its by - products			2
do n't get too frustrated when you ca n't figure out how to sync your cell phone and that new ear piece			1
when you need help , calling tech support is sometimes better than reading the manual			0
also , many older cells phones are n't integrated with @entity13 , nor do they have the software inside to upload important data like your address book			0
so , you may want to think about upgrading your cell phone before you buy your new mobile wireless device			1
iphone users beware : @entity13 does n't seem to be super compatible , although you can perform basic functions with ease			0
@entity284 's answer : sync it used to be that only luxury cars like @entity288 or @entity289 had built - in voice recognition systems			1
now with @entity284 's @entity293 system , most consumers can afford the $ 395 price tag for this hi - tech option			1
powered by @entity296 , @entity293 is a voice - activated communication and entertainment system			1
rated in 2007 as @entity300 's no. 4 " @entity299 , " @entity284 's @entity293 also offers one of the best hands - free calling options to date			1
the system is rather easy to use and lets drivers bring their digital media players , mp3 players and @entity13 - enabled mobile phones into the vehicle and operate these devices via voice commands or through buttons on the steering wheel and radio controls			1
so , does @entity293 really work ? we recently tested the first generation @entity293 on a 2008 @entity316 as well as @entity293 's second generation on @entity284 's super cool new @entity318			1
we discovered @entity293 does have its drawbacks as only certain mp3 players and mobile phones are completely compatible with @entity293 's software			0
on the 2008 @entity316 , for example , we could make calls from a @entity325 or an @entity326 , but the system did not automatically upload contacts or music files			0
and , it did take some time getting used to the voice command system			0
in the @entity332 , which looks like a limo - sized @entity333 and drives like a dream , we found the next generation @entity293 to be much more user - friendly with its pleasing digital display and easy - to - use voice commands			1
if you have a compatible mobile phone , @entity293 can even translate and send your text messages via the system 's electronic voice ! @entity284 has been the first car manufacturer to implement @entity293 , although its exclusive contract with @entity296 ends this year			1
this means perhaps more auto manufacturers will adopt @entity293 - like software systems after the 2009 model year			2
@entity352 's solution is to offer hands - free calling via its @entity355 subscription system			0
the company says about one million 2009 model year @entity352 vehicles will be equipped with voice - activated @entity13 integration , which uses the vehicle 's speaker system			1
now that you know the laws and have options to comply , are you still confused ? well , just like we 've been warned for decades about drinking and driving , it now seems that it is time to change your habits and stop talking while behind the wheel .			0
