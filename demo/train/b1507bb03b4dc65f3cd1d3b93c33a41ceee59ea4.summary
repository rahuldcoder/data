@entity0 , @entity1 -- on board the @entity4 , thousands of passengers were dining , drinking , attending a magic show , perhaps trying their luck in the casino			1
it was friday night on the luxury cruise liner , sailing in the @entity12 off the @entity1 coast with about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- a night of entertainment and relaxation			1
there was annoyance , but no real alarm , when the lights went out -- not at first			0
passenger @entity22 said she thought it was part of the magic show			0
but those on board then heard an ominous scraping sound , and the 951 - foot vessel gave a shudder			0
the ship began to list to one side			1
still , many passengers were not panicked			1
@entity22 said they were told the problem was electrical and would be fixed soon			0
her cabin steward told her there was nothing to worry about			0
but there was plenty to worry about : the @entity4 had struck rocks off @entity1 's @entity40 and was taking on water			1
as it dawned on them that something was wrong , passengers headed toward the lifeboats -- accessible only on one side of the leaning ship			1
according to passengers ' accounts , chaos ensued as guests rushed to fill the lifeboats and escape the ship			1
some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard , passengers said ; remaining crew members seemed helpless to handle the melee			1
" women and children first , " a lifeboat crew member announced -- meaning families who were clinging to one another had to be separated			0
passenger @entity64 , who was on his honeymoon , made a rope ladder to climb down from the outer fourth deck to the third deck			0
he and his wife @entity69 clung to the ladder for more than three hours before they were picked up by a lifeboat			0
" you were going higher and higher , and you were on a vertical position , " said @entity73 , a dancer aboard the ship			1
" i was holding on to the railing			0
" noise and creaks could be heard , she said			0
" it was very , very scary			0
" @entity81 , on the cruise with her brothers , said she thought several times that she might die			2
she and her siblings waited for at least an hour and a half for help after all the lifeboats had departed			2
" waiting was definitely the worst , " she said			0
" because we did n't know who was going to be coming , how much longer we would have to wait			0
" crew members were hard to find in the confusion , and little to no information was available about what to do or what was happening , passengers have said			2
@entity22 said she wished the crew had directed passengers to grab warm clothes , coats or shoes , as there was time for them to do so			2
authorities said no mayday distress signal was issued by the ship and are investigating			2
" the crew tried hard but they kept telling us they had no information , " said @entity108 @entity107			0
" it was n't until an hour into this situation that we got into a lifeboat and were lowered			0
" in the haste , some lifeboats malfunctioned or were not operated properly , some said			2
" at one point we were being lowered , and we were sliding off to one side , " @entity107 said			0
" everyone fell into one side of the boat and were slamming into the ship			2
this happened a few times over 30 seconds			0
and finally we were lowered into the water level			2
it took 30 minutes to get to shore ... the lifeboats were slamming into each other			2
" lifeboats on the ship 's higher side became stuck , leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the screams and cries of children , said passenger @entity142			1
some passengers braved the water , with a temperature of about 57 degrees , and swam to safety			1
others had no choice , as they fell into the chilly water			2
nighttime temperatures on @entity40 have recently dipped below freezing			0
on shore , sirens blared as some of the 20 injured were taken to hospitals			0
helicopters plucked some passengers off the ship 's decks			1
many of those rescued were taken to churches and other buildings for shelter , some of them wearing the pajamas and slippers they had on when they left the ship			2
cruise passengers are required by law to attend a safety briefing within 24 hours of embarkation			1
but passenger @entity64 said the briefing was more of a " sales pitch " for shore excursions			0
others , who embarked at @entity178 , about an hour 's train ride from @entity180 , had yet to have the briefing			2
as the @entity4 came to rest on its side , a huge gash in its hull , rescue efforts were launched to locate those left unaccounted for , with rescuers working underwater in near - total darkness to scour the ship -- which has 17 decks and some 1,500 cabins , eight bars , five restaurants , four swimming pools and a casino			1
three survivors were found -- an @entity1 purser and two @entity200 honeymooners			1
however , others were not so lucky			0
the bodies of two elderly people , both wearing life jackets , were found near one of the ship 's restaurants			1
and a 65 - year - old woman died after suffering a heart attack , authorities said			0
another body was found monday , bringing the death toll to six			0
that toll could rise , especially in light of @entity1 coast guard chief @entity216 's revelation in a television interview , as reported by the state @entity219 news agency , that 29 people are unaccounted for			1
that figure includes two of the 120 @entity108 who were aboard the ship , the @entity108 @entity222 in @entity1 said			1
rescue efforts were suspended for a few hours monday after the vessel began to shift and move , @entity40 mayor @entity226 said			2
they resumed later in the day , although the @entity1 coast guard said it was concerned about increasing winds in the forecast			1
rough seas were also forecast for the area on monday			0
pier @entity236 , @entity237 chairman and chief executive , told reporters he holds out hope others may still be alive			2
the ship has about 2,300 tons of fuel on board , @entity236 said , adding that so far there is " absolutely no evidence of fuel leaking into the sea			2
" as rescuers worked to find survivors and recover bodies , the @entity1 @entity248 -- as well as @entity249 , the parent company of @entity237 -- launched investigations into what went wrong			1
on saturday , the ship 's captain , @entity258 , was detained and faces possible charges of manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board , authorities said			1
the ship 's data recorders were seized and were being analyzed by prosecutors			1
@entity268 has denied abandoning ship , saying he and his crew were the last to leave the @entity4			1
speaking on @entity1 television , he insisted the rocks were not marked on his map			1
however , the coast guard maintained the waters are well - mapped , and local fishermen say @entity40 's coast is known for its rocky sea floor			1
the @entity4 was too close to the island , authorities have said , and was investigating why			1
one potential theory : apparently the @entity4 had a tradition of " a kind of fly - by " with @entity40 island , where it would approach the island , those on board would wave and the ship would sound its horn , said @entity2 's @entity290			1
it was unclear whether such a maneuver was being attempted and the ship got too close			0
on sunday , @entity237 said in a statement there may have been " significant human error " on @entity268 's part			1
" the route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore , and the captain 's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard @entity4 procedures , " the statement said			1
however , @entity237 also defended its crew , saying crew members " acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation			0
" @entity268 's attorney , @entity311 , said in a statement monday the captain was " shattered , dismayed , saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed " over the incident			0
but , he said , @entity268 was " comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver " -- steering the boat into shallow water , which saved lives			0
@entity268 is set to appear in court tuesday , where he will be questioned in a closed hearing			0
@entity2 's @entity328 and @entity329 contributed to this report from @entity331 , along with @entity2 's @entity332 and @entity333			0
@entity2 's @entity290 and journalist @entity334 contributed from @entity0 , @entity1 .			1
