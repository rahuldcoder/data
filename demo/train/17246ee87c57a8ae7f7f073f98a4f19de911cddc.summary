-- @entity1 is venturing where few footballers have gone before			1
on friday the @entity4 turned 40 , marking the start of a new chapter of a career which has seen him achieve unprecedented success with @entity10			1
twenty two years , eight months and 27 days on from his debut for the @entity13 club , @entity1 is officially the most decorated player in @entity15 football history			1
the explosive winger turned midfield playmaker has won 13 @entity19 titles , four @entity20 , four @entity21 and two @entity23 titles , not to mention numerous personal accolades			1
whle most middle aged men are worrying about their waistlines , @entity1 seemingly remains impervious to the ravages of time			1
so just what is his secret ? according to the man himself -- yoga " you can feel it working and you can feel the benefits straight away , " he was quoted as telling the @entity34			0
" my body feels so much better having done the yoga			0
" i still get the odd hamstring strain , which you are going to get playing football , but it was n't about curing the problem , but making it less frequent			0
i wish i had done it from the start of my career			0
" at an age where most players have long since hung up their boots , 8308 days on from his first @entity10 appearance as a substitute in a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity54 , @entity1 is demonstrating rare longevity			1
" @entity1 is obviously a different player now compared to when he broke through as a 17 - year - old winger , " @entity56 , who played alongside @entity1 at @entity10 between 1997 and 2000 , told the club 's official website			1
" but that says a lot about how football has developed in terms of sports science to make sure that players still have enough power and energy to play the physical part of the game			0
" even accounting for advances in sports science , @entity1 ' ability to remain effective at the top level as he enters his fifth decade is still exceptional			1
@entity77 defensive stalwart @entity76 , a picture of durability and the rock of a successful @entity82 defense for 24 years , called time on his own glittering career at @entity1 ' age			2
@entity86 striker @entity85 retired in 2008 aged 42 , before making a one - game comeback in 2009 , saying he was unable to regulate his body weight while not playing regularly			0
it is @entity1 ' ability to remain in peak physical condition which sets him apart from other aged soccer stars			2
few players could have controlled a top - level match the way @entity1 did this week , orchestrating @entity10 's 5 - 0 demolition of @entity96 in a @entity23 group match			1
@entity10 manager @entity98 , who took over from @entity99 at @entity13 , is still a keen admirer of @entity1 ' talents			1
the @entity102 highlighted @entity1 as the perfect role model for any young player looking for a long , successful career in the sport			1
" people mention his age but all you should mention is his football ability , " @entity98 , who has appointed @entity1 as a player / coach , told a press conference			1
" he 's an unbelievable footballer			0
all round he is a wonderful player and i am really fortunate to be working with him			0
" @entity1 will tell us when he has had enough , or when he thinks his time is up , " the former @entity54 manager added			2
" he keeps training day in day out and his performances since i came to the club in the summer have been excellent			0
" i think , when you get to @entity1 's age , it 's best to make decisions at the end of the season			2
it 's how you feel , how you 've done over the year and what your body is telling you			0
" there 's no quick decisions on that one			0
he 's on the staff now , so we can always use him at any time ! " @entity1 also credits his continued influence and fitness to spending his entire career at one club , avoiding the upheaval which can accompany numerous transfers			2
" if i 'd moved from club to club i 'd be finished by now , " @entity1 said after his virtuoso performance in @entity96			2
" i 'm lucky that i have been at one club , where i am surrounded by good players			0
i also have a good manager			0
" i look after myself and try to train every day in order to make myself available for selection			0
" i enjoy it as much as i can and , of course , try to contribute to the team			0
" for much of his time at @entity154 was part of a group of homegrown players affectionately known as the " @entity158 " -- referring to the year @entity10 won the @entity159			1
@entity1 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 and @entity164 all broke into the first team together and went on to achieve era - defining success under the tutelage of legendary @entity10 manager @entity99 , who retired last season after 26 years at the helm			1
in his recently - released book @entity99 refers to @entity1 as the leader of the group , who are celebrated in the forthcoming documentary " class of ' 92			2
" " he was the @entity177 , the man , " says @entity99 when referring to his longest serving players			0
on sunday @entity1 could make his 954th appearance for @entity10 in its match against @entity180			1
