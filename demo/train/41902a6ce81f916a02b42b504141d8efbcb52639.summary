@entity1 , @entity0 -- after concerns over a revamped @entity6 privacy policy surfaced last month , some questioned whether the web giant is still living up to its longstanding motto : " do n't be evil			1
" absolutely , says @entity9 , the man behind social network @entity10			1
" if we do things that are evil , with one click you can leave @entity6 , " @entity9 said on the opening day of the @entity14 festival on friday			1
" if we break the users ' trust , we can lose to competitors very quickly			0
" under the policy , which went into effect on march 1 , @entity6 does n't collect any more information about users than it did before			2
but all of that data , from tools like @entity30 , @entity6 search , @entity32 and @entity34 mobile devices , is now compiled into a single profile of each user 's habits			1
privacy watchdogs , including some members of @entity40 and dozens of state attorneys general , have expressed concerns the policy is too invasive			2
@entity9 said @entity10 is an important part of the " new @entity6 " that will use those profiles to provide more relevant services ( advertisements were the ones that came up again and again ) across the company 's many platforms			1
before , he said , @entity6 products were developed in " silos , " unable to share information with each other			2
" there are some things @entity6 could have done better , " he said			2
" if we could build a common notion of your identity and your relationships , we thought , we could make @entity6 better			0
" for example , he said , on @entity10 user could " +1 " ( the site 's equivalent of a " like " ) a restaurant			1
months later , a friend could be using @entity6 search to find a restaurant in the same area and discover it as a recommendation of sorts			0
@entity9 , a senior vice-president for engineering at @entity6 , also used his " fireside chat " with tech writer and @entity75 co-founder @entity74 to defend the success of @entity10			1
last month , web analytics firm @entity78 released a report saying that @entity10 users averaged just 3.3 minutes on the site for the entire month of january			0
that came just weeks after @entity6 ceo @entity84 announced the site had hit 90 million users -- up from 40 million in october			0
" @entity10 is a social layer across all of @entity6 's services , " @entity9 said			1
@entity9 said the site now has 100 million " 30 - day actives			0
" but when pressed by @entity91 for a definition , he said that 's people who log in to @entity10 , then use one of @entity6 's many other products within a month			1
so , then , not only does @entity10 plus have dramatically fewer than the more than 800 million users @entity98 claims , but that return rate does n't even mean people actually came back to @entity10 ? @entity9 said it 's not legitimate to only study @entity10 return visits as a measure of the network 's success			1
" that 's counting only one aspect , " he said			0
" we think that 's crazy			0
" instead of a @entity98 - like standalone network , @entity10 works to make all of the @entity6 universe social , he said that did n't stop him taking a thinly veiled jab at @entity98 when asked about allowing developers to create third - party content on @entity10 ( think @entity116 , @entity117 or @entity118 )			1
@entity6 has been slow to do so			0
@entity9 said he wants to make sure the months - old service 's programming system is ready before opening it up to outside developers			2
in contrast , he suggested , @entity98 has made several sweeping changes to its interface , sometimes forcing developers to start over from scratch			0
" i 'm going to release that ( programming interface ) when i know we 're not going to screw over developers , " he said			0
" we hold ourselves to a higher standard			0

the man behind social network @entity10 defends the company 's privacy policy at @entity14
" if we do things that are evil , with one click you can leave @entity6 , " @entity9 says
@entity9 says @entity10 is an important part of the " new @entity6 " that shares user info across products
