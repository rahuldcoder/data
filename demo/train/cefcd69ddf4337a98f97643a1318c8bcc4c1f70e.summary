-- in the cold light of morning , @entity1 still looks like the man to beat for the @entity5 presidential nomination , but the buzz tuesday night in the debate hall and since has mostly centered on @entity8			1
given up for dead only a few months ago , his campaign seemingly in shambles , @entity9 has tripled his standing in the polls in a little over a month and even leads @entity1 in some of them			1
that may say a lot about @entity1 , but it also shows that @entity9 must now be taken seriously			1
the tuesday debate illustrated the strengths and the dangers that @entity9 brings to the campaign			1
@entity1 , who had a little less speaking time than @entity9 , was crisp and once again showed a command of the issues			1
but as his own team seemed to realize , he did n't stand out as he often has in the past			0
instead , it was @entity9 who seized the spotlight : he was both more interesting and more of a gambler			1
political analysts since the debate have been wondering nonstop how much he may have hurt himself by going " soft " on immigration			1
early reports out of @entity33 suggest he will pay a price there			0
but was it a shrewder move than many analysts assume ? for what it 's worth , my own bet is that he will take a temporary hit but in the long term , he may strengthen his prospects			0
for one thing , he has shown he is willing to stand up for his convictions ( not a bad offset against @entity1 )			1
second , he is in effect asking voters to take a second look at him -- and betting that they may like the " new @entity8 " better than the old one			1
for decades , @entity9 has been regarded as one of the smartest , most creative figures in politics			1
no one else could have engineered the @entity5 takeover of the @entity58 in 1994 in the way he did nor achieved what he did in his early years as speaker			2
but during that time , he also acquired a reputation as a bomb thrower who could be bombastic , erratic and an intellectual bully			0
his best friends saw that he had enormous strengths and yet worried about his weaknesses , both professional and personal			0
few thought him ready for the @entity58			0
as he re-emerges into the spotlight now , an important question is whether he is the same @entity8 as before or whether he has changed			2
talking with him and then listening to him as he spoke 10 days ago at the @entity72 , i sensed that the years may have brought a maturing , a rounding and a steadiness that could serve him well			0
certainly , he seems happier and more rooted in his personal life -- @entity78 , his third wife , is constantly by his side and is both partner and confidante			0
whether these are deep , genuine changes is hard to say			0
he drew headlines in recent days with his suggestion to weaken child labor laws so students could take the place of school janitors and his reference to the @entity90 as a " reactionary socialist institution			0
" it is easy to be cynical			0
but the @entity8 of the tuesday debate surprised a lot of people			1
he showed a humanity on the immigration issue that might worry the base but also suggests a greater appreciation and empathy for the travails of others			2
americans like that in their presidents ( see @entity106 )			0
one wonders whether @entity9 has become wiser and more forgiving after wrestling with his own personal failings and now asking voters for another chance			2
the next few weeks will be crucial for the @entity9 campaign			2
he knows that he will undergo intense vetting from the media and his opponents -- he has been smart to go on the offense through the @entity117			0
voters may well decide he is too much of a risk			0
but if he survives near the top of the polls , he is the first alternative to @entity1 who has the chops to win the nomination			1
for now , despite the polls , @entity1 seems a much more likely choice			2
he has the money , the organization and the personal capacity			0
a day after the debate , @entity131 has been putting @entity1 's chances for the nomination at 67 % compared with 13 % for @entity9 ( interestingly , @entity130 is at third )			1
but the @entity1 forces know they may have a real fight on their hands -- especially if voters decide there is a " new @entity8 " in town			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			2

@entity143 : @entity8 generated the most buzz at @entity0 debate
he says @entity9 , once *written* off , is now a top - tier *contender* in the race
@entity143 says his remarks on immigration may win him points , could *signal* a " new @entity8 "
but he says @entity1 remains the man to beat within the @entity5 field
