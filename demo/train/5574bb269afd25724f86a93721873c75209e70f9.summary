-- is @entity1 looking to ground transportation as a promising target after the introduction of intense security measures for air travel ? and are its supporters able to operate out of @entity8 without hindrance ? those two questions have been raised after the announcement by @entity13 police on monday that they had thwarted a plot to attack a rail link between @entity13 and the @entity16			1
the @entity13 announcement has puzzled some terrorism experts , because @entity8 authorities are widely seen as hostile to @entity1			1
@entity8 has denied the conspiracy could have been plotted from its territory			1
@entity13 officials say they did not think the alleged conspirators were " state - sponsored " but suspect @entity1 elements in @entity8 had provided two men in @entity13 with direction , guidance and information			1
as @entity0 national security analyst @entity36 noted , " if these allegations are true , it would appear to be the first time that @entity1 elements based in @entity8 have directed some kind of plot in the @entity35			1
" while @entity40 intelligence agencies have long thought that @entity1 operatives are present on @entity8 soil , they were thought to be under some form of house arrest and under strict control			1
many @entity1 sympathizers and members took refuge in @entity8 in the aftermath of the post 9/11 invasion of @entity51 , including one son of @entity53 , @entity54 , and a son - in - law , @entity56			1
@entity56 left @entity8 in february this year and entered @entity57 , but was subsequently arrested in @entity58 and flown to the @entity16 in march			2
it 's still unknown whether he left @entity8 of his own volition or was told to go			1
but @entity8 has become increasingly hostile to @entity1 as it has become a @entity62 sectarian group , especially in @entity63 and @entity64 , as much as an anti-western outfit			1
in @entity64 , the @entity1 - linked @entity66 is one of the most effective fighting groups against the regime of @entity70 , which is heavily backed by @entity71			2
the vast majority of @entity8 are from the @entity74 sect of @entity75 , and @entity1 has frequently targeted @entity74 communities and mosques in @entity63			1
@entity1 leader @entity78 has often railed against @entity8 in his speeches			1
but the @entity16 says there appears to have been some tactical co-operation between the @entity82 and @entity1			2
in 2011 , the @entity83 accused @entity8 of a " secret deal with @entity1 allowing it to funnel funds and operatives through its territory			1
" railroad targets another aspect of the alleged @entity13 plot is that it underlines the enduring interest of @entity1 and its supporters in attacking railroad systems , seeing such operations as relatively cheap and easy to carry out -- with potentially devastating results			1
a senior law enforcement official in the @entity16 told @entity0 's @entity97 that one of the routes targeted was between @entity100 and @entity101 , with the alleged conspirators looking at possible targets in the @entity101 area , such as trestles over roads or water			2
" i worry about the vulnerability of mass transit because we know they 've been on @entity1 's radar screen , " @entity108 , a former director of infrastructure protection at the @entity110 , told @entity0			1
@entity108 said that while significant steps had been taken in the @entity16 to make air travel more secure , not enough was being done to reduce the vulnerability of mass transit to bomb attacks			0
he told @entity0 that there needed to be greater investment in random searches by agents with explosive trace detection equipment and greater deployment of cctv cameras , saying the extra investment needed in mass transit security amounted to a fraction of the economic cost of a successful attack			0
@entity1 's interest in attacking railroads was underlined in the wake of the raid that killed @entity53 in may 2011			1
documents recovered from his compound in @entity140 in @entity141 revealed that early in 2010 , @entity1 had discussed an idea to derail a train in the @entity16 , several @entity16 officials told @entity0			2
the plan was to be executed coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks			0
by then , two plots against @entity16 railroad targets had already been foiled			0
in march 2008 , @entity16 @entity1 recruit @entity149 discussed a plan to attack the @entity151 with @entity1 operatives in a jihadist encampment in the tribal areas of @entity141			1
@entity149 later testified that his idea was for an @entity1 operative to leave a suitcase bomb with a timer on a train and then exit at a station before the device exploded			2
his @entity1 handler then decided the best scheme would be to launch a suicide bombing on a train as it entered a tunnel , to create maximum devastation			2
in september 2009 , the @entity168 broke up an @entity1 plot by @entity170 and two others to bomb @entity100 subway lines			0
at their subsequent trial two of the group testified that they settled on a plan to target @entity100 subways during rush hour so they could cause the heaviest number of casualties , instill fear , and inflict maximum economic damage			0
authorities were alerted to the planned attack only days before @entity170 drove from @entity184 to @entity100 , after his communication with a known @entity1 facilitator in @entity141 was intercepted			1
@entity170 had apparently been asking his handler for help in making the explosive tatp			0
@entity1 cells have also plotted attacks on railway systems in @entity193 and @entity194			2
the most lethal was carried out on board several commuter trains in @entity199 in march 2004 , in which 191 people were killed and more than 1,700 injured			0
there is little evidence to link " @entity1 central " with the @entity199 attack , which involved a cell of mainly @entity205 immigrants			0
several weeks later the cell that carried out the attack attempted to blow up a bridge on the @entity211 high - speed train line			0
the plot was abandoned after the terrorists realized they had been spotted by nearby workers , who alerted police , a @entity193 official told @entity0			0
the official added that hundreds could have been killed given the quantity of explosives left at the scene			0
the explosives were similar to those used in the @entity199 attacks			0
bomb disposal experts found between 24 pounds ( 10 and 12kg ) of explosives connected to a detonator with a 440 - foot ( 135 - meter ) cable			0
on july 7 , 2005 , @entity1 suicide bombers killed dozens on the @entity229 underground system			0
a follow - on attempt two weeks later failed when the bombs malfunctioned			0
in december 2012 , @entity194 police discovered a crude improvised explosive device placed in a bag on a platform at the main railway station in @entity237			0
@entity194 authorities have stated they have " robust evidence " @entity241 extremists were involved but no arrests have yet been made .			0

@entity13 authorities suspect @entity1 elements in @entity8 provided guidance to alleged plotters
@entity8 has denied the alleged rail conspiracy could have been plotted from its territory
western intelligence has long thought any @entity1 operatives in @entity8 are under strict control
@entity1 's interest in attacking railroads underscored following death of @entity53
