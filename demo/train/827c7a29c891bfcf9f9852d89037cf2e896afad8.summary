-- just when one might have thought that lunacy over gun policy in the @entity3 can not be exceeded , think again			0
in the wake of the @entity7 massacre , @entity4 adopted a universal background check system and a modest restriction on the size of high - capacity magazines			2
this was good news for everyone except gun sellers who do n't want the sales to felons and the insane to dry up ( and those who think what for most purchasers would be a five - minute background check is too much of an imposition )			0
since gun sellers call the shots at the @entity27 , the lobbying group launched an effort to punish @entity4 legislators who stood up for public safety over gun seller profits			1
now , two thoughtful @entity4 legislators have been recalled and the @entity27 is crowing at having exercised its muscle once again			1
other states are trying to up the ante			0
only last week , @entity36 highlighted the nonsense by offering concealed carry permits to blind individuals			2
state battles intensify on access to guns this week in @entity48 , by the thinnest of margins -- only 1 vote in the @entity47 -- the legislature failed in its effort to make that state a haven for gun toting felons and lunatics by overriding the governor 's veto of a bill designed to thwart any form of federal gun regulation , including background checks , and even trying to make it a crime for federal agents to enforce these laws			1
the claim that the state can unilaterally decide to nullify federal law is so preposterous that even the strongest of gun advocates with some understanding of @entity71 precedent acknowledge its invalidity			1
indeed , @entity73 , who personally funded the litigation designed to convince the @entity71 that the @entity75 , which begins " a well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , " had nothing to do with a well - regulated militia has recently conceded that the @entity48 stunt flouts the very @entity82 that its supporters claim to uphold			1
even @entity73 's concessions fall on deaf ears in the legislatures of @entity87 and @entity88 , where the idea of state nullification of federal gun laws seems eminently reasonable -- despite the clear language of the @entity93 of the @entity82 , which states , the " constitution and the @entity95 ... shall be the supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby , anything in the @entity82 or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding			1
" while @entity36 is merely highlighting the absurd laxity of gun laws in this country , the damage will be slight since most blind @entity107 will have the good sense not to possess or discharge firearms			2
but the overheated rhetoric flowing from the @entity27 crowd during the @entity4 recall and from @entity48 ( and similarly inclined states ) is dangerous for at least two reasons			1
first , it undermines our democracy when voters act based on false and misleading views about the actual content of state and federal laws			0
second , similar hyperbolic rhetoric after the passage of the federal background check system and the ( now elapsed ) federal assault weapons ban galvanized the unstable gun zealot @entity128 forward with his scheme to blow up the federal building in @entity131			0
the @entity27 can succeed in its efforts to punish legislators who stand up for positions its own president once specifically advocated and push for clearly unconstitutional laws by recklessly fooling voters into believing that federal gun laws are tyrannical			2
in fact , federal gun restrictions are so lax that the @entity3 overwhelmingly dominates the world in the number of guns held by private citizens -- and also among rich countries in its rate of gun deaths from murder , suicide , and accidents			0
just the other day , a child killed herself with her father 's gun while camping in @entity155			0
law - abiding citizens with guns have to recognize their obligations to prevent the types of tragedies that occur on a daily basis in the @entity3 when lawfully owned guns are used , intentionally or inadvertently , to kill and maim others			0
one needs to accommodate the interests of legitimate gun owners if sensible gun laws are to be passed , but gun owners must also take responsibility -- first , by not being duped by @entity27 deceptions to advance the economic interests of gun merchants , and second , by taking every effort to ensure that their guns do not contribute to the mayhem			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

a *controversial* gun measure in @entity48 failed to override veto by one vote
@entity184 : the measure 's claim that a state can nullify federal law is absurd
he says in states like @entity4 and @entity36 , gun *rights* advocates are gaining ground
@entity178 : gun owners must be more responsible to not be duped by @entity27 deceptions
