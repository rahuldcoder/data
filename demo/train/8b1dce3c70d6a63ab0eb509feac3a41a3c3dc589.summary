-- @entity1 fully understands all she 's been through : her lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis that led to her deteriorating lungs , the campaign her parents waged that temporarily changed national policy surrounding organ transplants , and the fact that she came so close to death in the days leading up to her two double lung transplants			1
" she said , ' @entity13 , i knew i was dying , ' " @entity12 recalls			0
" that was like a very crushing moment for me			0
and she said ' i just did n't want to tell you i was dying because i did n't want to upset you			2
' " her parents say that was the toughest part			2
" she asked , ' if i go to sleep , will i wake up the next morning ? ' " remembers her father , @entity18			0
today , spirits are vastly different than they were two months ago , when @entity1 -- who 's had cystic fibrosis since birth -- was in dire shape after being on the waiting list for pediatric lungs for 18 months			1
her first transplant was a failure			2
after keeping @entity1 alive for days by circulating her blood outside of her body to keep oxygen flowing , she received a second transplant			1
aside from a brief scare with pneumonia , this one was a success			0
now @entity1 and her family are preparing to head home for the first time in half a year			1
" i 'm very excited , " @entity1 says , with a low , raspy voice , because of the tracheostomy tube that remains in her throat			1
" i would like to play with my brothers and sister			0
" she also has plans to go horseback riding and try her hand on a soccer team			0
all things , the family now believes , she 's very likely to accomplish			1
speaking exclusively to @entity0 for the first time since the surgery , @entity12 and @entity18 say 11 - year - old @entity1 could be discharged from @entity54 as early as tuesday			1
" we have n't been a family in a while , " @entity12 says			1
" it 's ... hard to be a family when half the family lives at @entity54 ( @entity54 ) and half lives at home			2
" @entity1 's parents say her lung biopsies show 0 % rejection of her new lungs , and on saturday she was officially taken off her oxygen machine			1
however , she still needs mechanical assistance â € ” and will for some time -- until her diaphragm regains its strength			0
" the lungs are doing great , " @entity18 says , adding that at this stage it 's all about rehabilitation of @entity1 's muscles			1
" what 's really exciting is that we know we are on the road to recovery now			2
" because she was in a medically induced coma and essentially paralyzed for more than three weeks , @entity1 's body needs to relearn many things , including how to walk			1
her physical therapy sessions can last for three hours each day and include weightlifting and cardio components			0
though the process of recovery will be a long one â € ” @entity12 estimates nine months to a year â € ” @entity1 is up for the challenge			2
asked if she considers herself a tough girl , @entity1 says , " yes , very			2
" " because every time i faced things that i thought were going to be hard , then i 've done them			0
" @entity12 says when things get difficult , she and @entity18 do their best not to let their emotions show , especially around @entity1			2
but they admit it 's happened			0
" she 'll say , ' @entity13 what 's wrong ? ' i said , ' it 's just hard @entity1			1
you worked so hard today , and you 're obviously so exhausted			0
i wish life were easier for you			0
' and she said to me , ' but it 's not easy , and that 's ok			0
' " dr. @entity105 on @entity1 's story and that 's been @entity1 's mantra : " i 'm not going for easy , i 'm just going for possible ... and what 's in front of me right now is possible			1
" @entity12 and @entity18 are quick to call @entity1 a fighter , even though anyone who meets her knows it from the start , and these days they have more confidence than they 've had in months that they 'll be able to see their daughter live out a life that 's closer to normal			1
" i fully plan to watch her graduate from college and watch her get married someday and do whatever it is she wants to do , " @entity12 says			0
" i just do n't think they 're going to be as easy for her to obtain those things as somebody else , but i think she is going to have them			0
" it is n't lost on anyone in the @entity1 family that their daughter may not be here today if it were n't for the fierce public battle the two parents waged that started with @entity138 and quickly spread to the national media			1
@entity12 and @entity18 's fight has temporarily changed national policy , making children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists			1
" this is an issue that will always matter to me , " @entity12 says , adding that she 'll keep fighting because the country needs " a better plan " for distributing organs			0
for now , though , their focus remains on helping @entity1 get her strength back			2
" i think you 'll see @entity1 a year from now as a kid going into sixth grade , walking confidently back into school like every other sixth grader , " @entity12 says			1
" ( it 's ) not going to happen tomorrow , but it will happen			0
" " she 's going to get what she wants , and we 're going to get what we want , which is just a regular kid			0
" if you 'd like to help the @entity1 family , they 've set up a donation page at www.gofundme.com/3c4dh0 to assist in their medical expenses .			1
