@entity0 -- top administration and congressional officials are expected to continue working this week on a measure to raise the federal debt ceiling by up to $ 2.5 trillion , embracing a version of a fallback plan designed by @entity9 minority leader @entity8 to avoid a potentially catastrophic default			1
at the same time , @entity12 leaders are planning a series of votes on a proposed balanced budget amendment to the @entity16 and sharp caps on future spending			1
the bills have no chance of clearing @entity21 or winning the approval of president @entity23 , but would allow republicans to demonstrate their preference for steps favored by their party 's conservative base			1
the maneuvering will take place against a backdrop of heightened anxiety as fears rise that @entity0 will not be able to pay its bills starting next month			0
if @entity21 fails to raise the current $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling by august 2 , @entity35 could be hit with rising interest rates , a plummeting dollar , and increasingly jittery financial markets , among other things			1
the seriousness of the overall situation was reinforced thursday when a major credit rating agency , @entity43 's , said it was placing the @entity35 ' sovereign rating on " creditwatch with negative implications			2
" @entity46 -- another major rating agency -- said wednesday that it would put the sterling bond rating of the @entity35 on review for possible downgrade			2
@entity23 warned last week that he could not guarantee older @entity35 will receive their @entity52 checks next month if a deal is not reached in time			1
republicans accused the president of resorting to scare tactics			0
nevertheless , the two sides continued their talks over the weekend			0
@entity23 met at the @entity59 sunday with @entity59 speaker @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity59 majority leader @entity62 , @entity63 , according to a spokesman for @entity60			1
" we 're making progress , " the president said monday			0
" we ca n't let politics stand in the way of doing the right thing			0
" it " was never going to be easy ( and ) it certainly does n't look easy today , " added @entity59 spokesman @entity71			1
however , @entity71 added that all the congressional leaders in the talks were committed to reaching a deal , whether a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement sought by @entity23 , a smaller version or the fallback option that focuses on raising the debt ceiling			1
" we have to ensure that there is a fallback provision ; that there is a measure through which @entity21 will act and we can ensure that the @entity35 will not default , " @entity71 said			1
" and the leaders in that room are unanimously in support of doing that			0
" @entity90 's plan appears to have gained momentum over the past few days as hopes have faded for a grand bargain including tax hikes on the wealthy and reforms to popular entitlement programs such as @entity97 and @entity52			0
the @entity12 leader 's proposal would give @entity23 the power to raise the borrowing limit by a total of $ 2.5 trillion , but also require three congressional votes on the issue before the 2012 general election			1
specifically , @entity23 would be required to submit three requests for debt ceiling hikes -- a $ 700 billion increase and two $ 900 billion increases			1
along with each request , the president would have to submit a list of recommended spending cuts exceeding the debt ceiling increase			1
the cuts would not need to be enacted in order for the ceiling to rise			0
@entity21 would vote on -- and presumably pass -- " resolutions of disapproval " for each request			2
@entity23 would likely veto each resolution			2
unless @entity21 manages to override the president 's vetoes -- considered highly unlikely -- the debt ceiling would increase			1
the unusual scheme would allow most republicans and some more conservative democrats to vote against any debt ceiling hike while still allowing it to clear			1
@entity90 , @entity129 , and senate majority leader @entity130 , @entity131 , are also working on two critical additions to the plan , according to congressional aides in both parties			2
one would add up to roughly $ 1.5 trillion in spending cuts agreed to in earlier talks led by vice president @entity139 ; the other would create a commission meant to find more major spending cuts , tax increases and entitlement reforms			2
changes agreed to by the commission -- composed of an equal number of @entity59 and @entity9 @entity148 and @entity12 -- would be subject to a strict up - or - down vote by @entity21			1
no amendments would be allowed			0
sources say the panel would be modeled after the @entity154 and @entity153 , which managed to close hundreds of military bases that @entity21 could not otherwise bring itself to shut down			0
as congressional leaders continue laying the groundwork for the plan , @entity12 are moving ahead with a more partisan measure to " cut , cap and balance " future budgets			1
the plan includes major spending cuts , caps on future spending as a percentage of economic production , and a balanced budget amendment to the @entity16			0
the @entity59 released a statement monday promising a veto if the @entity12 plan reaches @entity23 's desk			1
" instead of pursuing an empty political statement and unrealistic policy goals , it is necessary to move beyond politics as usual and find bipartisan common ground , " the statement read			0
@entity60 called it " disappointing " that " the @entity59 would reject this common - sense plan			2
" " if we are going to raise the debt limit and avoid default , the @entity59 must be willing to demonstrate more courage than we have seen to date , " the speaker said in a written statement			1
the @entity12 initiative stands in sharp contrast to @entity23 's stated preference for a package of roughly $ 4 trillion in savings over the next decade composed of spending reforms and tax increases on the rich			1
" i 'm a little frustrated that ( administration officials are ) never willing to be specific about the reductions in spending that they would be willing to do , " conservative sen. @entity195 , @entity196 , said sunday			0
" the president always just holds out this idea that , well , if you 'll raise taxes , and he is very specific about the taxes he wants to raise , then ( he ) might be willing to look at cuts elsewhere , " @entity195 said			0
" well , of course , that 's just not good enough			0
so , the point i 'm trying to make is when the president says he 's willing to compromise , understand why @entity12 leaders have been pretty reluctant to go along with this deal because we frankly do n't know where the spending reductions come , but we do know where the taxes are			1
" @entity12 have repeatedly insisted that they are the only side offering concrete proposals to address mounting deficits and the federal debt			2
democrats in turn have belittled the @entity12 's push for a balanced budget amendment , a perennial favorite of conservatives			0
" this notion that we somehow have to change the @entity16 to do what we were elected to do is just plain wrong , " sen. @entity227 , @entity228 , said sunday on @entity230 's " @entity229			0
" " bottom line is , those who want to push a balanced budget amendment are saying , ' i ca n't promise you that i wo n't steal again , but i will vote for the @entity238			0
' " at the heart of the current debate is @entity23 's call for more tax revenue by allowing tax cuts from the @entity245 presidency to expire at the end of 2012 for families making more than $ 250,000			2
his plan would keep the lower tax rates for @entity35 who earn less			2
@entity12 insist they will not agree to any tax increases , arguing that such a move would derail an already weak economic recovery			2
@entity23 noted last week he is not looking to raise any taxes until 2013 or later			1
in exchange , the president said , he wants to ensure that the current progressive nature of the tax code is maintained , with higher - income @entity35 assessed higher tax rates			0
but resistance to higher taxes is now a bedrock principle for most republicans , enforced by conservative crusaders such as political activist @entity265			0
@entity265 's group , @entity266 , has sponsored a high - profile pledge to oppose any tax increase			0
the pledge has been signed by more than 230 @entity59 members and 40 senators , almost all of them @entity12			1
@entity1 's @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity59 spokesman says all the leaders in the talks agree on the need for a deal
@entity21 will vote this week on the @entity12 " cut , cap and balance " plan , aides say
@entity23 will veto the @entity12 " cut , cap , and balance " plan if it reaches his desk
the @entity35 must raise its $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling by august 2 or risk a default
