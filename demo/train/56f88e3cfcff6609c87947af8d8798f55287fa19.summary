-- the last few years when he has played at his home grand slam , the @entity4 , @entity1 has been asked : when are you going to retire ? the former no. 1 has been hit hard by injuries in recent campaigns , undergoing multiple hip operations and another procedure to mend a foot , so it 's not the silliest question			1
@entity1 perennially replies that he still thinks he can compete with the best players in the world when healthy -- or close to it			2
the feisty baseliner proved it sunday when he beat his fellow 32 - year - old , @entity18 , 6 - 1 4 - 6 6 - 3 to win the @entity19			1
it was @entity1 's first title since downing @entity18 in @entity22 in 2010 and his first in @entity23 since @entity24 nine years ago			1
the victory over the 17 - time grand slam champion wo n't be enough to earn @entity1 a seeding at the @entity4 next week but once again he 'll be a player the favorites want to avoid in the early rounds			1
" playing the best players in the world and finals of tournaments , always it 's exciting , " 60th - ranked @entity1 told the @entity36 's website			2
" that 's why you still play the game			0
" for me , it was motivation enough just to try to get the win out there and obviously win another title			0
" it 's been a couple of years			0
so i was ready for the challenge today			0
" @entity18 , playing with a larger racket head this year in a bid to recapture old form , had n't been broken en route to the final and struck 20 aces in the semifinals against @entity55			2
but two - time grand slam winner @entity1 , a fine returner , broke the @entity58 three times in the first set			1
@entity18 appeared to have taken control of the affair when he broke at 4 - 4 in the second but @entity1 grabbed an early break in the third and saved all seven break points he faced			2
@entity18 fell to 18 - 9 against @entity1 and has lost two of their last three encounters			1
" i did n't play great today , which is a bit unfortunate , " @entity18 said			0
" but also @entity1 was the best player i played this week			2
" he made it toughest on me			0
i have a clear idea what i need to work on , and i have a clear idea where my mind and body is at			0
" both men will now spend the next week preparing for the year 's first major			0
" i 'm very hungry and eager to attack the @entity4 , " said @entity18			0
there was , however , a @entity58 winner sunday as @entity80 beat @entity82 @entity81 7 - 5 6 - 2 in @entity83			1
@entity80 , who made his debut at the year - end championships in november , captured a second title in the southern @entity88 city following his triumph in 2011 .			1

@entity1 wins his first title in four years by *defeating* @entity18
@entity1 became the first player to break @entity18 in @entity94 and triumphs in three sets
@entity18 's record against his fellow 32 - year - old and grand slam champion fell to 18 - 9
