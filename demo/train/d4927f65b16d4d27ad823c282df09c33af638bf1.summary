@entity0 -- the fate of the controversial @entity4 pipeline was n't the only thing at stake during a crucial vote in the @entity8 on tuesday			1
the vote blocking legislation that would have authorized the pipeline 's construction previews a new era of animosity between resurgent @entity14 in @entity15 and president @entity16			1
it could also seal the fate of embattled @entity20 sen. @entity19 of @entity21 , who had made pushing the measure a focal point in an uphill battle to fend off a @entity14 challenger in a runoff election next month			1
@entity19 fell one vote short of securing the support necessary to advance the legislation			1
all 45 republicans voted for the measure and 14 @entity32 did , too			2
but she needed one more @entity34 to join her to reach the critical 60 vote threshold			1
the failure to muster enough @entity20 votes occurred even though @entity19 had insisted for days that she had the votes she needed			1
" i feel very comfortable , " she said monday night			2
in a three hour - long @entity8 floor debate tuesday in advance of the vote , @entity19 was a bit more tentative			1
" this is one of the first debates in eight years where the outcome is uncertain , " she said			0
" we usually know the outcome of the vote before we take it because the deals are all cut			0
" in her speech , @entity19 made an aggressive case in favor of approving the pipeline while other @entity32 dissented			1
" to everyone who thinks this pipeline is the @entity57 -- we already have 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the @entity59 , " @entity19 said			1
" we 're only completing basically 1,000 miles			0
what is everyone upset about ? " @entity63 @entity20 sen. @entity62 pointed out the potential health risks of laying the pipeline , including heart disease , increased hospitalization , and a higher prevalence of chemicals that " penetrate deeply into the lungs			1
" " the facts are the facts are the facts , " she said			0
" if you 're not a scientist , then be humble and listen to the peer - reviewed scientists			2
they do n't have a special interest			0
they have an interest in giving us information we should base our decisions upon			0
" @entity62 also referred to the project as the " @entity84			0
" @entity4 protesters have message for democrats the @entity14 - led @entity88 on friday approved a measure that will skip the conclusion of the six - year - old @entity92 review of the pipeline and authorize its construction			1
though the @entity8 blocked that bill tuesday , incoming majority leader @entity96 ( @entity97			1
) said afterward that the newly - elected @entity14 majority will make it an early priority once the new @entity15 is in place in january			2
if the @entity8 ultimately approves the measure , @entity16 could be poised to issue what would be just the third veto of his nearly six year presidency			1
at a news conference last week , @entity16 made clear that he does n't want @entity15 to interfere with the @entity92 's process			0
" understand what this project is : it is providing the ability of @entity111 to pump their oil , send it through our land , down to the @entity116 , where it will be sold everywhere else			0
it does n't have an impact on @entity59 gas prices , " @entity16 said at a friday news conference in @entity119			0
the showdown comes as @entity16 and congressional republicans appear to be on a collision course over immigration			0
@entity14 are considering how to respond if @entity16 follows through with a pledge to revise immigration policies by the end of the year			0
some @entity14 lawmakers have talked about potentially shutting down the government if @entity16 keeps that promise			0
on @entity4 , @entity32 had moved toward a vote largely in an effort to help @entity19 , the @entity136 chairwoman			1
she is facing off in the december runoff against @entity138 rep. @entity138 , who sponsored the @entity88 's @entity4 bill and has been promised a seat of his own on the energy panel			1
the measure offered @entity19 a final chance to demonstrate her clout before voters return to the polls			1
already , @entity19 was joined by 10 @entity20 co-sponsors : @entity149 sen. @entity148 , @entity151 sen. @entity150 , @entity153 sen. @entity152 , @entity155 sen. @entity154 , @entity157 sen. @entity156 , @entity157 sen. @entity158 , @entity160 sen. @entity159 , @entity162 sen. @entity161 , @entity164 sen. @entity163 and @entity164 sen. @entity165			1
three more @entity32 had pledged last week to support the measure : @entity168 sen. @entity167 , @entity170 sen. @entity169 and @entity172 sen. @entity171			2
but by monday night , it was clear that the list of @entity19 's potential @entity20 allies to provide the final vote had dwindled			1
one of @entity19 's top targets , @entity164 sen. @entity178 , said he would n't support the measure			1
another potential backer , @entity181 sen. @entity180 , an independent who caucuses with the @entity32 , told @entity1 tuesday he would vote against the bill			1
@entity19 's entreaties to other @entity32 had also been rejected			1
outgoing @entity186 sen. @entity185 would not support the pipeline , a spokeswoman said monday			2
nor will @entity189 sen. @entity188 , who tweeted his opposition over the weekend			2
also confirming their opposition to the measure to various news outlets were @entity196 sen. @entity195 , @entity198 sen. @entity197 , @entity200 sen. @entity199 , @entity170 sen. @entity201 , @entity189 sen. @entity202 and @entity168 sen. @entity203			2
retiring @entity20 sen. @entity204 of @entity205 said he would n't be voting for the pipeline			1
" i 've come to this conclusion : every dollar that we spend on fossil fuel development and use is another dollar we spend digging the graves of our grandchildren , " he told reporters tuesday			0
" and i 'm not going to be a part of it anymore			0
that 's just how strong i feel			0
i know we ca n't solve it overnight , but we have to be on a steep glide path in getting rid of fossil fuels as a source of energy for our planet			0
" even @entity19 's @entity20 supporters were facing pressure			1
anti-keystone activists , including college students , were trying tuesday to convince @entity169 and @entity167 to change their minds , protesting at the senators ' @entity232 offices			0
" we 've been playing politics for too long and this is not a political game ... this is affecting everyone , " student @entity234 told @entity1 inside @entity167 's office , holding a sign that read , " sen. @entity167 , if you 're not a climate denier , do n't vote like one			2
" " [ @entity167 ] needs to vote his conscience on this one , " added student @entity245			0
@entity248 : a @entity4 veto is ' equivalent to calling @entity59 people stupid ' the peaceful scene in @entity167 's office was in contrast to a more rambunctious protest in @entity169 's office , where protestors loudly chanted , " you ca n't eat money , you ca n't drink oil , " " keep the tarsands in the soil , we do n't want this dirty oil , " and " what do we want ? " " climate justice , " " when do we want it ? " " now			2
" staffers attempted to speak to protesters in @entity169 's office and explain his vote			0
" what i hear you saying is that the senator is politicizing an environmental crisis , " one protester said			0
" if he believes the science , there 's no reason for him to be voting like this and mortgaging our future , " said another			0
@entity232 police arrested four of the activists inside @entity169 's office			0
they were escorted outside to chants of " climate heroes			0
" fact checking @entity4 jobs claims @entity1 chief congressional correspondent @entity284 , @entity1 's @entity285 , @entity1 's @entity286 and @entity1 's @entity287 contributed to this story .			2
