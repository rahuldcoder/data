the @entity0 took a step friday toward being the first country in the world to allow a pioneering in vitro fertilization technique using dna from three people that could prevent mitochondrial diseases but that also raises significant ethical issues			1
one in 6,500 babies in the @entity0 is born with mitochondrial disorder , which can lead to serious health issues such as heart and liver disease , respiratory problems and muscular dystrophy			1
problems with mitochondria , the " powerhouse " cells of the body , are inherited from the mother , so the proposed ivf treatment would mean an affected woman could have a baby without passing on mitochondrial disease			1
but the cutting - edge @entity30 technique , which involves transferring nuclear genetic material from a mother 's egg or embryo into a donor egg or embryo that 's had its nuclear dna removed , raises ethical questions			1
the new embryo will contain nuclear dna from the intended father and mother , as well as healthy mitochondrial dna from the donor embryo -- effectively creating a " three - parent " baby			1
the amount of donor dna in the mitochondria will , however , be much less than the parental dna in the nucleus , which determines the baby 's characteristics			0
@entity30 - related birth defects may originate with moms , not treatment the @entity0 government plans to consult on draft regulations on the fertility treatment later this year , with the intention of putting the measure before parliament next year			1
at the moment , only unaltered eggs and embryos can be used for in vitro fertilization			0
" mitochondrial disease , including heart disease , liver disease , loss of muscle coordination and other serious conditions like muscular dystrophy , can have a devastating impact on the people who inherit it , " said the @entity0 's chief medical officer , professor dame @entity64			2
since scientists have developed " ground - breaking new procedures " that could prevent these diseases being passed on , @entity75 said , " it 's only right that we look to introduce this life - saving treatment as soon as we can			1
" the government says public consultation shows there is " overall support " for the treatment			0
but dr. @entity85 , director of @entity86 , a @entity87 - based watchdog group , opposed use of the technique friday -- saying it opened the door to the creation of " designer babies " -- and disputed the results of the public consultation , saying not enough weight has been given to online polling			2
" these techniques are unnecessary and unsafe and were in fact rejected by the majority of consultation responses , " he said in a statement			0
" it is a disaster that the decision to cross the line that will eventually lead to a eugenic designer baby market should be taken on the basis of an utterly biased and inadequate consultation			0
" @entity85 told @entity109 that conventional egg donation already allows a mother to bear a child without passing on a mitochondrial disorder , so the benefit of the new technique would only be to allow the baby to be genetically related to her			1
" while i can understand that , that 's not a medical benefit to anybody -- and you have to weigh it against the risks of invasive techniques that will clearly carry a risk to the child , " he said			0
could ' personhood ' bills outlaw @entity30 ? there 's also a " risk to society at large , " he said , because once the ethical line over modification of human dna has been crossed , the door will be opened to " the next step and the next step after that			2
" " that 's why governments around the world over the last 20 years have said ' we wo n't allow you to genetically engineer human beings , ' " he said			0
even if approved by lawmakers , more research is needed to ensure that the procedure actually works in humans and can be carried out safely , @entity85 said			0
the government 's announcement friday prompted a slew of @entity0 media headlines -- and will probably continue to divide the scientific community			0
the @entity0 - based @entity153 , which carried out a six - month inquiry into the ethical issues around the technique , concluded that the health and social benefits of living free from mitochondrial disorders meant that " on balance ... if these novel techniques are adequately proven to be acceptably safe and effective as treatments , it would be ethical for families to use them			1
" its working group also concluded that " mitochondrial donation does not indicate , either biologically or legally , any notion of the child having either a ' third parent , ' or ' second mother			2
' " but @entity172 law professor @entity171 , a bioethicist who specializes in the governance of science , medicine and biotechnology , urged the @entity0 to " proceed slowly and cautiously " given the " unresolved safety and ethical questions " around the new technique			2
" @entity180 is known about the short - and long - term genetic effects of this procedure on children born with its aid , " he said			1
" it would be an ironic tragedy if this procedure were rushed from bench to bedside , only to harm the very children it was meant to help			0
" moreover , there remain serious questions about the ethics of conceiving children with three genetic progenitors or ' parents			0
' " @entity30 ' co-pioneer ' @entity199 dead at 87			2

" @entity180 is known about the short - and long - term genetic effects , " says a @entity202 bioethicist
government takes a step toward allowing an @entity30 technique involving @entity208 from 3 people
it is intended to prevent mitochondrial disorders being passed on from mother to child
