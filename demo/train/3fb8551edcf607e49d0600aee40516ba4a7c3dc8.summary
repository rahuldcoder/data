when @entity0 , 43 , was a little girl she would run outside her home in @entity3 , near the @entity5 @entity4 in the @entity6 , every time she heard a plane fly by			1
" i would say ' bye bye , @entity9 ' because the only thing i knew about my father was my dad was riding a plane , " she recalls			1
the daughter of an @entity18 naval pilot and a @entity20 mother , @entity15 is one of an estimated 52,000 " amerasians " fathered by @entity18 military servicemen during the decades the @entity23 and @entity24 had bases in the @entity6			1
the majority of their mothers worked as bar girls in the area 's thriving " rest and recreation " industry , where soldiers were their regular clients			1
when the @entity18 military left the bases in the early 1990s , these children were left behind			1
on march 4 , in honor of @entity43 , a group of 60 @entity39 from the cities surrounding former bases will celebrate in a special way			1
their " 100 letters to our fathers " campaign will see the group - whose members range from teenage to those in their 50s - reach out with messages of love and hope to fathers almost all of them never knew			1
many of the handwritten letters will be read aloud and will be accompanied by their photos and a short video showing conditions @entity39 have faced			1
all will be available on a new website , with the goal of bringing the issues of @entity67 in the @entity68 from the sidelines to the surface			1
left without fathers , many of these @entity39 were also abandoned by their mothers , who were often unable to care for them			1
the majority of children were raised in extreme poverty by family members or guardians , with little access to social services , and suffered from a lack of identity and intense discrimination			1
they were stigmatized for being illegitimate and for being the children of prostitutes			1
amerasians fathered by @entity18 soldiers say they suffered the most extreme prejudice			1
@entity89 , 44 , does not know the name of her @entity18 - @entity18 father or her mother			2
she does not know where she belongs			2
she remembers a childhood where she hid at home because she looked different			2
" they see my color and my hair and they tease me ' negra '			2
i am always crying because i do n't feel good			2
i tell them when i grow up i am going to change my blood so i am going to be white , " she recalls			2
@entity102 , 28 , says living with constant discrimination taught him to fight			1
" when i walk on the streets people look at you from head to toe and make a face ... or they say ' hey nigger , come here ' and then they punch me , " he says			2
many are unable to finish school -- either due to financial problems , or out of frustration			2
@entity117 , 24 , only finished third grade			2
" i was always bullied in school because of my color ... and they accuse you of doing something just because you are different , " he says			2
@entity125 feels caught in a vicious cycle : " i ca n't find a good job because i ca n't go to school			2
i am just always working as a housemaid , " she says , " how can i change my life ? i am just trying my best			2
" this feeling of helplessness often extends to the workplace			2
@entity102 says he was even refused a job at a supermarket : " they told me they ca n't hire me because i am black ... i feel so bad , so hurt			2
why do n't they give me an opportunity ? " @entity141 , 22 , a second - generation @entity142 , feels the @entity68 government has forgotten about them : " we do n't have any laws			1
we do n't have any rights			0
they look at us as if we are aliens			0
" i ca n't find a job to continue my life			0
" @entity151 , professor of political science at @entity153 , explains that this racial prejudice is deeply - rooted , but was strengthened by the country 's colonial past			1
" we long ago considered the @entity158 tribes superior and the @entity160 tribes inferior , " he says			0
" hispanic culture merely reinforced that prejudice with its eurocentric paradigm			0
the standard of beauty is fair skin , tall nose , straight hair			0
" growing up with such a lack of acceptance and economic hardship has taken an emotional and psychological toll on many			0
according to a three - year study conducted by dr. @entity175 , director of the @entity176 in @entity3 , " we have a severely socioeconomically impaired population , especially among @entity179 , who contend with serious physical and mental stress issues , including homelessness , alcohol and drug abuse			1
" having faced rejection on so many levels , many @entity39 consider themselves half @entity18 and long to be recognized , if not by their fathers , then by the @entity5 government			1
but current legislation does not make it easy to become a citizen			0
although the @entity193 passed the @entity194 of 1982 , which gave preferential immigration status to @entity142 children born in @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 during the @entity202 , it does not include those born in the @entity6			0
@entity20 @entity39 can only become citizens if their father claims them			1
according to @entity175 's research , one reason for this exclusion is the belief that @entity39 in the @entity6 suffered much less discrimination than in those countries			1
some @entity39 are children of a " steady bar fine " relationship			1
" this meant an @entity18 paid for you			0
you just took care of him during that time he was there , " said @entity215 , president of @entity216 , a group that works with former prostitutes and their families			0
" he stays at your home , you cook and clean			0
its like a steady live in partner			0
" @entity102 is one of them			0
he is part of a minority that knows their father 's name , yet he has no paperwork to back up any claims			1
but he has not given up his search			0
" i would tell him i love him and ask why he left me since birth , " he says			0
" i will ask him why he abandoned me			0
every day i am thinking i want to go to @entity5 or @entity179 because i feel i belong there			1
people have the same skin color			0
" but @entity243 , 19 , considers herself lucky			0
as a " white @entity142 " , she has faced much less discrimination , and after a five - year search , recently found her father by using the @entity248			1
" it 's the feeling that you 're complete , " she says			1
" the fact that he did n't deny me -- it is one great accomplishment			0
" but she explains that for those who may never find their fathers , having citizenship will at least make them feel they belong somewhere			0
past attempts for the @entity18 government 's help have had little success			1
in 1993 , mothers of @entity39 and their children filed a class - action lawsuit against the @entity5 government , asking for $ 68 million to care for 8,600 @entity142 children living in the town next to a former naval base			1
" we wanted the @entity18 government to support the @entity142 children , " @entity215 said			0
" we asked for money for food , shelter , education and health			0
" according to father @entity278 , president of @entity279 , the case was closed after the court decided most of the women were engaged in prostitution , which is an illegal activity and therefore could not be the basis for any legal claim			0
but the thousands of @entity142 children represented in that class action suit are now young adults			0
they have formed @entity68 @entity39 -- a loose network of formal and informal communities of @entity39 who plan to work on creating a national advocacy			1
they hope to reach out to @entity142 all over the @entity6 , coordinate community - level projects , and develop support programs			0
@entity243 says , " i 'm just hoping that my generation has the chance to go to school			0
i hope the treatment of the people will change			0
i hope they will accept us , that we are @entity39			1
" we deserve to work			0
we deserve to be in any government institutions			0
