a proposal to let rich donors give more money to political parties - slipped behind closed doors into a huge government spending bill -- is the latest in a string of setbacks for restrictions on money in politics and will be a " disaster for the @entity13 people , " according to good government groups			1
campaign finance reform advocate @entity15 called the provision a " great deal " for millionaires and billionaires who can buy influence through big dollar contributions and for the politicians seeking them			0
related : @entity23 reaches spending deal the $ 1.1 trillion spending bill , which would fund most of the government until next september , includes provisions that will allow donors to give a lot more money to @entity31 and @entity32 to help fund conventions , building projects and legal proceedings like recounts			1
rather than facing the current cap of $ 32,400 , donors would be able to give up to $ 777,600 each year to funds and committees run by the parties or their campaign arms			1
that means individuals could give $ 1,555,200 per two - year election cycle and couples could give $ 3,110,400 in a cycle , according to several campaign finance groups who have studied the legislative language			1
" if this passes it will be the most corrupting campaign finance provisions ever enacted in the history of the country , " said @entity15 , whose non-partisan group @entity51 has sent a letter to members of @entity23 urging them to vote against the bill			1
" the campaign finance laws have been left in shambles first by the @entity60 and then potentially by the @entity23 if this becomes law			1
" related : here 's what 's tucked in the spending bill watchdog groups see the move to chip away at the limits placed on donors as the latest step in a slow unraveling of the campaign finance rules put in place by landmark legislation like the @entity74 bill			1
known formally as the @entity74 , the legislation , among other things , limited how much individuals and corporations could donate to national parties			0
but in its april decision in @entity81 v. @entity82 , the @entity60 struck down limits on the overall campaign contributions individual donors can make to candidates , political parties and political action committees			1
that decision followed the court 's 2010 @entity91 ruling that the @entity93 allowed unlimited independent political expenditures by corporations , labor unions and certain nonprofit advocacy groups			0
@entity91 opened the floodgates to massive corporate spending in elections and these latest provisions would be a step in that direction when it comes to individual donors			1
the fear is that allowing more big money in politics places more power in the hands of big donors , effectively taking it away from individual voters			1
@entity112 , the president of the pro-campaign finance reform organization @entity113 , said @entity13 who care about everything from taxes to the high cost of college to clean air and water should care about changes to campaign finance rules , because @entity23 plays a role in all of those areas			2
" every single one of those decisions is impacted by money in politics , " he said			0
" it 's about who does @entity23 work for and @entity23 right now is changing the rules so that they are going to work even more than they are today for the wealthy and well connected			2
" @entity15 said if the language makes it to president @entity135 's desk , he should veto it to avoid enabling the campaign scandals that are sure to follow			0
@entity138 , director of public citizen 's @entity139 , agreed that the administration should make campaign finance reform a veto issue to send a message to the new @entity23			2
" this is a pretty scary foreshadowing of what 's going to be on [ sen. @entity150 ] @entity149 's list of to dos in the next @entity23 and certainly dismantling the campaign finance system is high on his priority list , " @entity145 said			2
@entity149 filed a friend of the court brief in the @entity81 case that the argued overall limit placed individual contributions " offends the @entity93			0
" " contribution limits restrict the rights of speech and association of both the contributor and the recipient of the contribution , " he wrote			0
@entity166 , policy director at @entity167 , a non-partisan organization that analyzes campaign finance laws , said she hopes there are enough provisions in the bill that raise the ire of enough @entity32 and @entity31 to stop it , otherwise it candidates will now be in the business of asking for even larger donations than they already are			2
while the new language would not change the limits on contributions to individual candidates , it is often the politicians themselves who solicit donations on behalf of their party committees			0
" what you 're now doing , if this provision goes into effect , is putting candidates out there soliciting for contributions of $ 1 million plus and that 's the nexus for these contributors ; they want the credit , " said @entity166			0
this is a return on investment			0
" the @entity198 is expected to vote on the bill thursday , but democrats in @entity23 have already raised alarms about the provision , with minority leader @entity203 saying it " would work to drown out the voices of the @entity13 people and massively expand the role of big money in our elections			1
" house speaker @entity210 argued that these and other provisions were " worked out in a bipartisan , bicameral fashion or they would n't be in the bill			0
" one campaign finance reform advocate noted that if these provisions become law , mega-donors who would have maxed out on individual contributions will have to hold onto their seats in the face of a flood of new " asks " from politicians and parties .			0

political donors will be able to give a lot more money to political parties if a massive spending bill passes @entity23 this week
provisions were tucked into the bill during closed - door *negotiations*
