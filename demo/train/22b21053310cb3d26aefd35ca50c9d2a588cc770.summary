-- on december 21 , 2012 , our calendar will align with the @entity3 date 13.0.0.0.0 , completing a great @entity3 cycle of time			1
there 's been a lot of hoopla that we are about to face a doomsday -- better known as the @entity10			1
there are television specials and panic buying of disaster supplies in @entity15 , a reminder of the stockpiling that took place for @entity19 back in 1999			2
while the @entity3 date will coincide with the solstice , the shortest day of the year , will it also coincide with the @entity23 ? i 'm no seer , but i am confident that december 22 will see the dawn			1
the ancient @entity3 of @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 were close keepers of time			1
they charted every day , organizing them into 20 - and 400 - year periods			2
using a base - 20 counting system ( ours is base 10 ) and zero , they easily calculated thousands of dates , some noting the existence of millions of years			2
why we 're fascinated with the apocalypse during the height of their civilization in the 8th century , the @entity3 recorded dates and deeds at dozens of city - states , from births and battles to the triumphant wrenching of trophies from enemies			1
artists inscribed their signatures on painted pots and stone sculptures			2
stucco inscriptions adorned monumental pyramids that crested over the rainforest canopy			2
but to continue building ever grander structures , the @entity3 needed resources			1
most of all , they needed timber to burn limestone in order to make cement			2
by the late 8th century , the rainforest was in retreat , fuel was scarce and recurrent drought led to desperation			2
eventually , there was chronic warfare as well			0
and so one of the most extraordinary civilizations came to a crushing halt			0
small groups of desperate dwellers in some cities held out behind hastily thrown - up palisades			0
elsewhere , foes burned enemy cities to the ground and smashed monuments , leaving them scattered across the surface to be found in recent times			0
scrub jungle overtook what had been sparkling white plazas			0
compact ball courts that had seen raucous competition of a team sport played like soccer went silent			0
wildlife scavenged lavish furnishings for their nests and dens			0
the reasons were many , and the outcome was shocking			0
the maya civilization collapsed in most of its southern lowlands , leaving only abandoned pyramids in silent cities			0
this was the true face of apocalypse			1
did they see it coming ? just a few years before the rot set in , @entity3 painters at the site of @entity113 , a small city in @entity115 , @entity27 , covered the walls of a small three - room palace with extraordinary murals			1
they painted more individuals -- men , mainly , but women and children , too -- than had been rendered before , numbering more than 250			0
they deployed more fancy pigments than had been used before , more than would ever be used again in ancient @entity27 , some 47 vibrant blues , reds and yellows			0
the paintings reveal the social layers of courtiers and lords , musicians and dwarves , victims and their blade - wielding sacrificers			0
musicians , singers and performers lined up to perform on plazas and pyramids			0
none of these activities or materials was new , but what was new was the rapidly crumbling world around the @entity113 painters			2
no one could change -- the paintings seem to tell us			0
the @entity3 ignored the crisis in front of them , instead dancing with great panaches of precious quetzal feathers on pyramids , as if the present would forever hold			1
now in the 21st century , perhaps we have also reached a precipice			0
global warming is not just fearful thinking -- it 's real			1
weeks after @entity160 , scientists are now predicting the near - term and long - term effects of global warming as more dire that previously thought			1
some , perhaps like our @entity3 predecessors , would rather not see the writing on the walls of our flooded cities			1
the crises pile up in front of us , one after another , and we ignore them at our peril			0
acknowledging and doing something about the problems in front of us seems hard			2
stockpile canned goods and buy a generator			0
as for december 21 , rest easy			1
this day will pass as if it were nothing more than the @entity180 , the nonevent of the decade			0
we 'll wake up on december 22 , and the world will still be here			1
and so will our pressing environmental challenges			1
we need to make some hard decisions and resolve that we will confront our own brewing apocalypse before it 's too late			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			1

there are doomsday fears of @entity194 apocalypse on december 21
@entity189 : the world will not come to an end , but we have pressing challenges
she says the @entity3 ignored crisis , *including* *depletion* of natural resources
@entity189 : we have to confront our own problems , such as global warming
