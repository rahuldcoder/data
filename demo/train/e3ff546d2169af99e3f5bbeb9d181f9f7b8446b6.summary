-- disgraced football legend @entity1 is scheduled to return to a @entity3 courtroom monday in a bid to get his robbery , assault and kidnapping convictions thrown out			1
the one - time @entity9 winner and @entity11 halfback is more than four years into a 33 - year prison term and is asking for a new trial			1
in court papers , he 's arguing that bad legal advice led to his arrest and conviction in a 2007 confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers			1
@entity20 not only accuses his old lawyer , @entity21 , of having a conflict of interest and of failing to mount an effective defense in his trial			1
he also says @entity21 told him before that confrontation that he was within his rights to take back property he believed had been stolen from him , " so long as there would be no trespass and no physical force used against the persons with the property			0
" @entity20 , 65 , was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the @entity39 hotel and casino and using threats , guns and force to take back the items from the two dealers			2
" @entity20 also contends that @entity21 did not advise @entity20 that carrying out the plan could subject him to criminal charges , regardless of the ownership of the property , " his new lawyers wrote in seeking a new trial			2
@entity20 also blames @entity21 for preventing him from testifying in his own defense			2
without putting him on the stand , " there was no evidence presented to adequately challenge the state 's evidence of criminal intent and knowledge of the guns or the bad character evidence to which the jury was exposed , " his appeal states			0
the @entity65 already upheld his conviction in 2010			0
prosecutors have called the new attempt to reverse his conviction " without merit , " and @entity21 is quoted in court papers as telling the judge in the original trial that he spoke to @entity20 only after the confrontation			1
" other than @entity20 's bare allegations , the record does not support any conflict of interest , " prosecutors wrote in response to @entity20 's claims			1
galanter could not be immediately reached for comment sunday			0
@entity20 's october 2008 conviction came on the anniversary of his famous acquittal on murder charges in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife , @entity20 , and her friend @entity90			2
though cleared of criminal charges , a civil jury later slapped him with a $ 33 million wrongful - death judgment , and lawyers for the @entity97 family have doggedly pursued his assets			0
his current sentence leaves him eligible for parole in 2017			0
