-- it 's hard to think of a better place for a mosque today than lower @entity4 , near to ground zero			1
to support the siting of a mosque there is not just deeply @entity10 -- a declaration of the freedoms we stand for -- it is the continuation of a long and established @entity15 tradition of mosque - building			1
in fact , by any historical measure it is absurd to see @entity20 , a community center that will include a mosque , as a kind of hostile and exotic cultural invasion of the lower east side			2
mosques have been part of @entity15 's rich architectural and religious mix for over a century , and today hundreds of thousands of @entity31 , many whose @entity15 roots go back generations -- attend the city 's more than 100 mosques in the five boroughs			1
the @entity31 who built these mosques are @entity15 , blameless in the events of september 11 , 2001 , and linked to other @entity15 through the deep shared sense of loss and pain evoked that day			1
their mosques , already part of our urban identity , bear witness to the strength of our freedoms , as will the @entity20 center			2
it is likely that @entity31 have prayed in @entity15 for much of its history , and particular buildings have been dedicated to @entity31 prayer for over a century			1
@entity31 slaves from @entity55 who lived in @entity15 no doubt had places to pray as early as the 18th century , but the first mosque building in @entity15 was likely the one belonging to the @entity58 in 1907 on @entity59 in @entity60			1
the @entity61 of @entity10 constructed its own mosque in 1939 , and in 1947 purchased the brownstone where the @entity64 can still be found today			2
the number of mosques in the city began to increase significantly in the 1960s after the ratification of the @entity70 , which increased immigration from @entity73 countries with @entity31 populations			1
over time , they would range from modest basement prayer halls to elaborate architect - designed buildings			0
one small mosque in @entity60 is composed of a dozen neighbors who take turns leading prayer			0
the first mosque of a new @entity31 community in @entity15 , for example , might simply be a suburban house , like the split - level in @entity87 , @entity88 that served as the @entity89 in the 1990s			1
with time , the community might gather the funds to construct a more elaborate building , like @entity94 's grander building today at the same location			0
many mosques in @entity15 are built and financed by the community members themselves ; some donate materials or work or money			2
the @entity103 in @entity104 , and the @entity106 cultural center in @entity107 were completed in the 1990 's with the help of the contracting and manual labor of their communities			0
a new mosque can result in the building up of a neighborhood			0
@entity116 was fashioned from an old building in @entity118 , @entity60 , and a representative of the @entity121 's 66th @entity120 commented to me in the 1990 's that the mosque had revitalized the neighborhood : " since the congregation renovated the building and began to function , the entire neighborhood has profited			0
" this is surely the case with the @entity130 @entity129 , a renovation of the former @entity132 in @entity133 by architect @entity134 in 1965			0
there the addition of dome marks the presence not only of a mosque , but a school and other community services that make it a beacon in the neighborhood			2
the mosque 's community has been instrumental in constructing low income housing and supporting the economic revitalization of @entity133			0
mosques as community centers all around @entity15 provide day care , help with small business start up , rooms for events , classes in @entity152 and other languages , gyms and recreational facilities for their neighborhoods			2
@entity15 's newly designed mosques are real products of @entity10 pluralistic culture			2
the first mosque in @entity15 designed from the ground up was probably @entity164 in which the community collaborated with a local @entity168 - @entity10 architect @entity167 , in 1983			1
such grand mosques as the @entity170 in @entity107 , or the modernist @entity171 on @entity4 's @entity172 ( designed by the famed architectural firm @entity173 ) are monuments to the transformations wrought by @entity31 communities : they are @entity10 mosques			1
yesterday @entity15 's landmarks commission voted unanimously to deny historic status to the @entity181 site , clearing the way for construction of @entity20 , also known as @entity20			0
the name @entity20 , though , is particularly fitting -- an evocation of the rich interactions of @entity187 , @entity31 and @entity188 in @entity189			0
@entity189 was not often a paradise of tolerance and peace			0
but where peoples lived together , the understanding spawned by that coexistence gave the lie to the notion that @entity31 , @entity188 and @entity187 must by nature be opposed , and created a more cohesive , fecund , peaceful and plural society			0
the @entity31 who pray in @entity15 's mosques are @entity10 who , like @entity203 or @entity188 immigrants before them , seek to be part of the city , part of this country			1
the more than 100 mosques of @entity15 are visual signs , not only of the presence of these @entity211 , but also of the religious freedom that distinguishes the @entity10 way of life			1
by their very existence they defeat the hostile , polarized vision of @entity217 and @entity10 that the authors of the @entity220 attacks hoped to engender			0
if we wish to stand in defiance of the unspeakable death and destruction of 9/11 , we could not do better than to welcome @entity20 in the very neighborhood of lower @entity4 where those unspeakable acts occurred , as part of the city 's long history tradition of mosque - building			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			0

@entity233 says siting a new mosque in lower @entity4 continues long @entity15 tradition
@entity31 have prayed in city for most of its history , she says , likely starting with slaves
the number of mosques *swelled* in 1960s after immigration *law* passed ; there are more than 100
@entity233 : built by *big* architectural firms or community efforts , they *reflect* @entity10 freedoms
