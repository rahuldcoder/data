-- a recent @entity0 op - ed asked " was the @entity3 hoax ethical ? " we at @entity6 , along with the activist group @entity4 , are behind the @entity3 website @entity8 , which we created to call attention to the company 's @entity11 destruction			1
so we were intrigued by this question			0
the writer , @entity14 , director of the @entity15 at @entity16 , said the spoof website did not announce itself as a parody and that omission could be called misrepresentation			1
and that could possibly be called unethical			0
but we revealed our role just hours after the site went up , and the site is so over-the - top -- it has a kids ' game called " @entity28 " -- that people realize very quickly that it is fake			1
but mispresentation is @entity14 's concern , which is why he should have addressed the ethics of @entity3 's multibillion - dollar international hoax perpetrated on @entity35 itself			2
a hoax the company has failed to reveal to the public			0
@entity3 made $ 31 billion in profits last year , while its ceo took home $ 15 million in compensation during one of the worst economic crises in a century			2
the company 's lobbyists in @entity47 , @entity48 and other global capitals work to slow the development of clean technologies and renewable energy , preferring instead a status quo that benefits their shareholders and leaves the massive costs of climate change to the 99 %			0
and yet @entity3 proudly advertises itself as a corporation deeply concerned with developing clean energy and ensuring a viable energy future , even going to great lengths to organize well - branded " eco-marathons " completely at odds with its relentless fossil fuel extraction			2
in the @entity11 , the oil giant is exploiting melting sea ice to drill for more of the oil causing global warming in the first place			1
all of this is happening despite clear evidence from the best scientists that global warming is already causing extreme weather events and it 's only likely to get worse			0
in the past few weeks , @entity3 's communications team has been busy trying to spin its way out of a series of recent crises , but it ca n't change the facts			2
the @entity3 fleet 's 14,000 - ton drill ship in @entity81 , the @entity82 , slipped anchor two weeks ago			2
the same drill ship ca n't meet the @entity86 standards the company agreed to earlier this year , and so @entity3 is asking the @entity88 to bend the rules at the 11th hour			2
an oil spill response barge , the @entity91 , which @entity3 promised the @entity92 was " @entity11 ready , " is in @entity93 , beset with technical problems			1
the company plays down these events and seeks to reassure investors that these major errors are par for the course , but these systematic attempts to mislead the public are clearly unethical			2
@entity3 has been relentlessly conducting its own pr campaign to distort the truth about what the company is doing in the @entity11			1
to get the truth out , we wanted to make a website that imagined a world in which @entity3 was a little less guarded about the implications of drilling for oil in @entity81			1
we asked ourselves : what if @entity3 really did ask people what they thought ? what would that look like ? we came up with @entity8			0
the response has been staggering -- nearly 4 million page views , 12,000 user - generated ads and a cascade of tweets			0
this reaction from the public shows @entity3 has serious problems in the court of public opinion , and that it ignores @entity11 defenders at its peril			1
by using the most popular form of contemporary communication -- social media -- to bypass @entity3 's billions , our supporters undermined the company 's social license to operate and brought global attention to its greed and willful ignorance of science			0
the site is a parody			0
and when people realize it 's a parody , they like it even more			0
we 've announced it as a parody after it went up and over and over again in the media since then			0
we have an ad generator : we provide a gallery of photos and readers provide the captions			0
new ads keep pouring in			0
people clearly want an opportunity to tell @entity3 what they think of the company 's @entity11 drilling program , and our site has provided them with a voice			1
it 's also highlighted some of the major environmental issues with @entity11 drilling that have been green - washed away			1
for example , the @entity163 granted @entity3 an " incidental harassment permit " allowing the company to work near whales and seals while drilling this summer , which could interfere with their breathing , breeding and nursing			1
to put this issue forward , we created an online " @entity173 " in which users can vote for which @entity11 mammal they 'd like @entity3 to harass the least as a funny way to draw attention to these brutal facts			1
but @entity3 and its sympathizers would like people to talk about @entity6 and the @entity4 rather than what the company is doing in the @entity11			1
as @entity14 himself says , " let 's keep it clean , everyone -- tell us who you are , and then take your best shot			0
" we 're @entity6 and the @entity4 , and we 're ready to sit down with @entity3 any time to debate the ethics of @entity11 drilling			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : @entity3 spoof website creators *criticized* for not saying site was fake
but , he writes , creators announced it was fake hours after it went up
@entity6 , @entity4 wanted to point out unethical behavior of @entity3 , he says
@entity208 : @entity3 is exploiting the @entity11 with dangerous drilling and trying to fool public
