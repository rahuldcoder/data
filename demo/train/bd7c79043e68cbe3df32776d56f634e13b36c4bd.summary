-- if second place is the first loser , then this week that 's a pretty great place to be			0
@entity5 ' literary adaptation " @entity4 " stunned the industry with a magnificent $ 51.1 million debut			1
of course , that number was n't large enough to take down @entity10 's superhero sequel , " @entity11 3 , " which topped the box office for a second weekend with $ 72.5 million , but it 's impressive nonetheless			1
ah , the summer movie season : when films actually make money ! ( provided that they 're not called " @entity18			0
" ) " @entity11 3 , " which had the second best opening of all time last weekend with $ 174.1 million , fell 58 percent in its second frame — a slimmer drop than " @entity22 " managed ( 59 percent ) but a heftier one than " @entity23 " scored ( 50 percent )			2
" @entity11 3 's " gargantuan $ 72.5 million weekend gave it a sizzling $ 17,400 per theater average from 4,253 locations and lifted its domestic box office total to $ 284.9 million after just 10 days			1
internationally , the film is proving even more invincible			0
the $ 200 million @entity34 title has now earned $ 664.1 million overseas , led by massive business in @entity36			2
" @entity38 ′ s " top two international markets are currently @entity39 ( $ 95.3 million ) and @entity40 ( $ 54.1 million ) , and it has become the highest grossing film of all time in both @entity43 and @entity44			1
worldwide , " @entity38 " has grossed a truly jaw - dropping $ 949 million , guaranteeing it will surpass $ 1 billion sometime this week			1
@entity0 review : ' @entity4 ' in second place , @entity48 's roaring ' 20s drama took in $ 51.1 million — the third best opening weekend ever for a film that did n't hit no. 1			1
( in 2004 , " @entity53 " debuted with $ 68.7 million but trailed " @entity52			2
" in 2009 , " @entity54 " started with $ 62.3 million but could n't overtake " avatar			1
" ) the glossy @entity58 @entity57 adaptation , which stars @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , broke out at the box office despite middling reviews and a " b " cinemascore grade			1
" this exceeded all our expectations , " says @entity66 , @entity5 ' head of domestic distribution , who claims that scheduling the adult - oriented literary drama between blockbusters like " @entity38 " and " @entity70 " helped it stand out			2
indeed , " gatsby " appealed to a different audience than most may action - spectacles			0
whereas " @entity38 " was dominated by male viewers last weekend , " gatsby " played to a core demographic of adult women			2
according to @entity5 , ticket - buyers were 59 percent female and 69 percent were above the age of 25			0
when asked what drew those ticket buyers , @entity66 says the film 's @entity86 - curated soundtrack definitely built buzz , but ultimately it came down to someone else : " three little letters : @entity91 " ' @entity4 ' soundtrack and the rich history of the rock star composer " @entity4 's " marketing has relied heavily on @entity59 's mug — and with good reason			2
@entity59 has become one of the most exciting movie stars working today without ever signing up for a major franchise or donning superhero spandex			0
" @entity104 's " healthy debut marks his second best opening weekend ever , behind only 2010 ′ s " @entity105 , " which started with $ 62.8 million			1
hot on the heels of " @entity108 , " which wrangled $ 162.8 million total , @entity59 is riding high at the box office			1
but " @entity112 " debut also marks a career high point for @entity115 director @entity48			0
before this weekend , the polarizing filmmaker 's best opening weekend belonged to his sweeping romance " @entity119 , " which bowed to $ 14.8 million in 2008			2
" @entity4 " easily clobbered that figure , and it will quickly become his highest grossing film ever , surpassing " @entity122 , " which danced its way to $ 57 million total in 2001			1
of course , " gatsby " was undoubtedly @entity126 's most expensive project , too			0
the film , which was shot in @entity129 , cost about $ 105 million to produce ( and reportedly would have cost about $ 190 million without @entity115 rebates ) , though audiences were n't overly excited about the @entity129 effects			1
only 33 percent of ticket sales were for @entity129 showtimes			0
@entity136 's directorial effort " @entity139 " wound up in third place in its third weekend with $ 5 million , marking a slim 33 percent drop			1
the @entity141 film , which stars @entity142 and @entity143 , has now earned $ 41.6 million against a slim $ 26 million budget			2
@entity145 and ' @entity38 ' : who knew the ' @entity148 ' screenwriter would turn out to be a thrilling director ? @entity151 's latest producing effort , " @entity18 , " bombed in fourth place with a terrible $ 4.9 million from 2,041 theaters , making it the first true misfire associated with the @entity151 brand			1
the filmmaker only produced the movie ( he typically writes and / or directs and / or stars in his films ) , but distributor @entity161 marketed the film on his name , preceding its title with " @entity165			0
" fortunately , " @entity18 , " which stars " @entity167 alongside @entity168 and @entity169 , only cost the studio about $ 15 million			2
audiences issued the film an unimpressive " b - " cinemascore grade			0
" 42 , " now in its fifth weekend , almost surpassed " @entity18 " ( and it still could once final figures are released )			0
the $ 40 million @entity175 biopic earned $ 4.7 million , bringing its total to $ 84.7 million so far			0
along with " gatsby , " " 42 " has been an encouraging performer for @entity5 , which suffered misfires like " @entity180 , " " @entity181 " and " @entity182 " in early 2013			0
" @entity38 " -- $ 72.5 million 2			1
" @entity4 " -- $ 51.1 million 3			1
" @entity139 " -- $ 5 million 4			0
" @entity18 " -- $ 4.9 million 5			0
" 42 " -- $ 4.7 million check back next weekend for full box office coverage of " @entity70 , " which earned an impressive $ 31 million from just seven international territories this weekend and will easily beam itself atop the domestic chart come friday			1
