-- stakes have been raised in the museum world with the reopening after 10 years of @entity5 's @entity4			1
enough old masters were dusted down and rehung during the renovation to get a room of @entity10 oligarchs panting			0
the chance to see @entity13 's huge and glorious " @entity16 " painting once more -- it has a whole room to itself in the refurbished gallery -- is reason enough to plan some serious museum crawling on your next @entity20 trip			1
but do you always want to follow the crowd to the obvious treasures ? your @entity25 , your @entity26 ? sometimes those artistic icons are obligatory sights but experts reveal that -- from a two - million - year - old stone tool to a life - size roman equestrian statue made entirely of bronze -- some of the most remarkable museum and gallery highlights take a little digging			1
what : the @entity39 stone chopping tool			1
where : the @entity42 , @entity44 ( @entity43 , +44 ( 0 ) 20 7323 8299 )			1
@entity45 , research manager at the @entity42 , says one piece he always takes people to is a two - million - year - old stone tool from the @entity39 in @entity49			1
" the lump of grey rock does not look much but it is one of the oldest humanly made objects in the world and the oldest thing in the @entity42 's collection , " he says			1
" it 's the starting point for who we all are today			1
" what : @entity13 's " @entity16			1
" where : the @entity4 , @entity5 ( @entity62 1 ; +31 20 6621 440 )			0
when the @entity4 reopened this year after a decade - long refurbishment there was no question about the key exhibit			2
@entity67 , the museum 's director , told @entity0 that @entity13 's " @entity16 " " is the altarpiece of the @entity4			1
the whole place is arranged around this beautiful masterpiece			0
" the 1642 painting of @entity5 's local militias is the only artwork in the museum with a trapdoor underneath , allowing it to be removed to safety in the event of fire or other danger			1
what : the @entity83 statue			0
where : the @entity85 , @entity86 ( @entity87 1 , +39 060 608 )			0
@entity86 's greatest treasures tend to be outdoors -- it 's a giant open - air museum			1
but @entity90 , art historian and owner of @entity86 tours , reckons the equestrian statue of @entity83 alone is worth the entrance fee to the @entity85			0
" the giant , totally intact bronze is the most @entity97 of statues , " she says			0
" it 's from the high period of empire so it 's of the finest quality , and it 's a heroic survivor of medieval ' recycling			2
' " what : @entity108 's @entity107 and the @entity109			2
where : the @entity111 , @entity112 ( @entity113 6 ; +39 55 238 8651 )			1
the sheer size and grace of @entity117 's " @entity116 " in the @entity118 makes it the most famous single piece in @entity112			1
but @entity120 , director of the @entity122 cultural walking tours company @entity123 highlights @entity108 's " @entity107 and the @entity109			2
" " it 's all in the way the artist has managed to depict the @entity128 as modeled by his wife -- with every tenderly detailed feature , ever strand of hair , you can see he is in love with her , " @entity124 says			1
where : the @entity139 , @entity140 ( @entity141 3 ; +49 30 2 6642 4242 )			0
few pieces are great enough to have an entire museum named after them			2
the @entity139 in @entity140 is n't exactly short of massive ancient monuments either -- but the @entity137 trumps the rest			2
transported from modern day @entity146 , this monumental stone altar dating back to the 2nd century @entity150 cows visitors with its size , then draws them in with astonishingly detailed friezes depicting the battles between gods and giants			0
what : @entity159 's " @entity158			2
" where : the @entity161 , @entity162 ( 4 @entity163 ; +33 01 40 20 53 17 )			0
@entity164 , art historian and docent for @entity166 , goes beyond the " @entity167 " to pick @entity159 's monumental marriage of high art and journalistic sensationalism			2
" the dramatic scene vividly depicts the makeshift raft holding the emaciated and even corpse - like survivors of @entity175 shipwreck @entity174 , abandoned by its politically appointed captain , " she says			2
" @entity159 represents the figures in a very realistic , yet also heroically classical way			0
it creates the perfect bridge between earlier masterworks found in the @entity161 and the early modern works on display at the @entity185			0
" what : " @entity187			0
" where : @entity189 , @entity190 ( @entity191 5 ; +43 1 525 240 )			0
the @entity189 is home to masterpieces by the likes of @entity196 , @entity13 , @entity197 and @entity198 but @entity199 , the museum 's director - general , points to @entity201 's " @entity200 " as the must - see			1
" a unique work of goldsmith art , the complex pictorial program culminates in an allegory of the cosmos with the god of the sea and the goddess of the @entity213 , animals , the four winds and the four times of the day , " says @entity199 of the piece returned to the museum this year after another decade - long renovation			1
" ' @entity187 ' is a truly virtuoso piece -- we know from @entity220 's autobiography that he hammered the figures from gold foil with every refinement he could imagine			1
" what : @entity226 's " @entity225			2
" where : @entity230 , @entity231 ( @entity229 de @entity228 , 52 ; +34 917 74 10 00 )			0
four of the 15 most expensive paintings ever sold are by @entity226 , yet the work widely regarded as his greatest masterpiece would almost certainly smash all records if put up for auction			0
@entity225 's size -- 3.5 meters by 7.8 meters -- makes it unusual , but it 's the political commentary about @entity240 bombing during the @entity241 and the layers of symbolism piled within that make it arguably the most famous artwork of the 20th century			1
what : the @entity249 sculptures			0
where : the @entity251 , @entity252 ( 15 @entity253 , +30 21 0900 0900 ) there 's no greater symbol of @entity257 classicism than the @entity249 , and most of the treasures from @entity252 's hilltop temple are inside the @entity251			1
dr @entity261 , author of " the @entity262 , " says the @entity249 sculptures are the pinnacle of @entity257 high classical sculpture			0
" their location in the @entity267 of the @entity268 allows us to appreciate them in the context of the @entity249 itself			0
you can faithfully recreate their original disposition on the temple , which is visible from the gallery , " he says			0
what : @entity279 's " @entity278			2
" where : @entity281 , @entity282 ( @entity283 28 ; 00 39 02 722 631 )			0
" @entity287 's ' @entity286 ' is @entity282 's outstanding artwork , but it 's on a convent wall , not in a museum , " says @entity284 , co-author of @entity285 's @entity122			1
his favored alternative is @entity279 's " @entity278 , " which was regarded as genuinely shocking when painted in the 1480s			1
" it is brutal in its simplicity , unsentimental in its treatment of @entity297 's pallid corpse on a slab and a masterclass in realistic foreshortening , which was a relatively recent innovation in art , " @entity284 says .			0
