the @entity2 broke federal law by exchanging five @entity5 detainees for @entity7 sgt. @entity6 without giving @entity1 the appropriate notice , @entity1 ' independent investigative arm announced thursday			1
@entity9 , general counsel for the @entity10 , wrote in a letter to nine @entity13 senators that the @entity2 should have notified " the relevant congressional committees at least 30 days in advance of the transfer			1
" moreover , @entity9 noted that the @entity10 also concluded the @entity2 broke the law by using " appropriated funds to carry out the transfer when no money was available for that purpose			1
" @entity9 noted that her office was n't weighing in on defense secretary @entity24 's decision to carry out the prisoner swap , but rather his " responsibility to comply with a notification condition on the availability of appropriations to transfer individuals from @entity31			2
" talking to @entity33 on thursday evening , @entity2 spokesman rear adm. @entity32 noted @entity35 's previous admission " that we probably could have done a better job keeping @entity1 informed			1
" but that does n't mean the @entity2 did anything illegal , @entity32 said			2
he stated officials felt they had " to move quickly " out of concern for @entity6 's life			1
the @entity2 said that president @entity44 's administration felt " it was necessary and appropriate to forgo 30 days ' notice " to do so			1
" we ... believe that it was lawfully done , lawfully conducted , " @entity32 said of the exchange			2
" and this was a judgment that was shared by the @entity52			0
" @entity9 's letter was in response to a june 13 request from the @entity13 senators for her opinion on the matter			2

@entity63 soldier freed in swap at the time of his release , the 28 - year - old was the longest - held @entity63 soldier since the @entity70			0
the swap stirred sharp criticism , especially among @entity13 who questioned whether the @entity63 government might encourage its enemies to take more @entity63 captive			2
others -- including members of his unit -- accused him of deserting his comrades in the midst of a war			0
an @entity7 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official who was briefed on the report			0

the @entity119 @entity13 did , however , reference " the @entity120 " and repeated @entity9 's assertions about the @entity2 handling of this matter			1
in doing so , he reiterated a claim made by many in his party -- as evidenced by the @entity13 - led @entity128 giving the go - ahead earlier this summer to sue @entity44 over executive orders -- that the administration has often overreached its authority			0
" while the president has a habit of ignoring laws relating to domestic policy , such as health care and immigration , this latest overreach regarding our national security has dangerous implications , " @entity112 said			1
" the @entity63 has a long - standing policy of not negotiating with terrorists for good reason , and these senior @entity5 leaders will soon rejoin the fight			0
