@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 , 35 , is the president of @entity4 in @entity5			1
he has an mba from @entity7 and an @entity8 ( @entity9 ) from @entity10 and @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity3 : " i do n't think i 'd be as complete a manager as i am today without the @entity9			1
" @entity3 tells @entity2 how his @entity9 has helped his career			1
@entity2 : tell us about your current role			0
@entity3 jr : i 'm president of @entity4 , in @entity5 , which i started in 2004			1
we supply finished products like sandwiches , cakes and desserts for @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , and a number of franchised restaurants			0
we also have a more upscale chain with bakeries , coffee shops and the biggest bread chain in the @entity5 subway system			2
we currently have 620 employees , 32 shops in @entity5 , and we hope to expand into @entity35 next year			2
@entity2 : you already had an mba , what made you decide to do an @entity9 ? @entity38 : we are hoping to expand @entity4 internationally , at least in @entity39 , and it could become an international company			1
the @entity9 is a really global mba			1
we had classes in @entity12 , @entity5 , @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44 ( in @entity45 ) so it gave a very international focus			2
in each city @entity10 arranged for guest speakers from very large companies to tell us about the business environment in each country			2
it gave me much more of an international focus			0
@entity2 : how has that global focus helped you with your business ? @entity38 : in my class i had senior people from 17 countries			0
we became like a family and we are still in touch			0
i 've been in different countries the last few years and my classmates have entertained me and showed me around in each of the countries			2
down the road , if we decide to go into some of these countries , i have contacts and i 've learned from my classmates , from their past experiences and the experiences they 're going through			1
@entity2 : what was the biggest difference between the @entity74 and the @entity9 ? @entity38 : a key difference is seniority			2
the average age on the mba was 28 and on the @entity9 it was 37			1
on an @entity74 people are getting ready to move into senior management , whereas much more senior management things being discussed on the @entity9			0
the other difference is that for the mba you take off two years of your life			0
with the @entity9 you still work , so every five to six weeks you meet for a week or two and you go to classes			0
with the @entity9 you do n't get spend as much time on the books , so an mba is more theoretical and with the @entity9 you learn a lot more from your classmates			1
i had numerous high - level people in my class and they shared how they 've done things in the past			0
read more business related features @entity2 : so because you 're working at the same time , can you put what you 've learned into practice ? @entity38 : that 's what was really cool -- all my classmates did it , taking stuff from class and applying it			1
i was able to get help from my finance professor about international standards for how some things are done on the books			0
the professors all have working experience -- they 're not just people with @entity114 who teach -- so you can ask for advice and even now i can email them and ask their advice			0
@entity2 : can you think of any example where you 've directly applied something you learned from the @entity9 to your business ? @entity38 : we learned about how one company got all its senior managers together and went out for a weekend brainstorm to set out their strategy for the next year			1
that 's something we did this past year at @entity4 , and we set out a really clear path and goals			1
so far we 've met all our goals this year , so it was a really great way of doing it			0
@entity2 : would you have got where you are today without the @entity9 ? @entity38 : it helped me out a lot -- i do n't think i 'd be as complete a manager as i am today without the @entity9			1
it 's given me a broader perspective for being a manager for all departments			0
my strong point has always been sales and when the company started that was the area i pushed the hardest , but now i 'm diving more into finance , accounting , marketing and @entity150 after the @entity9 i have a much clearer idea what 's going on in my company within all the different departments -- that 's where it 's really been a huge help for me			0
@entity2 : what would you say to people put off by the expense of an mba ? @entity38 : if you 're going to do an @entity9 program , do a good one			2
tuition plus time and expense will usually run into six figures in @entity168 dollars , but if you get into a good program it 's very worth it .			0
