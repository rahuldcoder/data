an urgent care center in @entity4 shuts down when a sick man recently returned from @entity6 walks in			0
health care workers complain they have n't been properly trained to protect themselves against the deadly virus			1
public health experts are asking whether the @entity11 @entity10 is partly to blame			1
here are five things they say the @entity10 is getting wrong			1
the @entity10 is telling possible @entity2 patients to " call a doctor			1
" when passengers arrive in the @entity11 from @entity6 , @entity17 or @entity18 , they 're handed a flier instructing them to " call a doctor " if they feel ill. never mind how hard it is to get your doctor on the phone , but even if you could , it 's quite possible she 'd tell you to go to the nearest emergency room or urgent care center			1
we saw how well that worked at @entity30 in @entity31			0
on september 25 , the hospital sent a feverish @entity34 home even though he had told them he 'd recently been to @entity6			1
and we 've seen how well that worked in @entity36 , where an ill man recently returned from @entity6 walked into an urgent care center , which then evacuated its other patients and closed for several hours			1
one way to do it differently : set up a toll free number for returning passengers that would reach a centralized office , which would then dispatch a local ambulance to get the patient to a hospital			2
the hospital would be warned that a possible @entity2 patient is on the way , and the patient would not be brought through the main emergency room			1
that 's the idea of @entity53 , an assistant professor at @entity55 's @entity54			0
" do you really want someone with @entity2 hopping on a bus to get to the hospital ? no , " he said			1
" and once they get there , do you want them sitting in the waiting room next to the kid with the broken arm ? again , no. " @entity10 director @entity65 faces rising tide of criticism 2			2
the @entity10 director says any hospital can care for @entity2 patients			1
" essentially any hospital in the country can safely take care of @entity2			1
you do n't need a special hospital to do it , " dr. @entity65 said sunday at a press conference			0
" i think it 's very unfortunate that he keeps re-stating that , " said @entity53 , the global projects manager for the @entity78			0
he said when it comes to handling @entity2 , not all hospitals are created equally			2
as seen at @entity84 , using protective gear can be tricky			0
plus , it 's a challenge to handle infectious waste from @entity2 patients , such as hospital gowns contaminated with blood or vomit			1
dr. @entity92 , an infectious disease epidemiologist at the @entity94 , said some hospitals have more experience with infectious diseases and consistently do drills in how to deal with biohazards			0
" if you were a burn unit patient , would n't you want to go to a burn unit ? " he said			0
the @entity10 may already be moving in that direction			2
designating certain hospitals as ebola treatment units " is something we 're exploring further , " said @entity103 , a spokesman for the agency			0
@entity10 ' doubling down ' on @entity2 training efforts 3			1
the @entity10 did n't encourage the " buddy system " for doctors and nurses			2
under this system , a doctor or nurse who is about to do a procedure on an @entity2 patient has a " buddy , " another health care worker , who acts as a safety supervisor , monitoring the worker from the time he puts on the gear until the time he takes it off			1
the " buddy system " has been effective in stopping other kinds of infections in hospitals			0
@entity53 said the @entity10 is considering recommending such a system to hospitals			2
@entity10 did n't encourage doctors to develop @entity2 treatment guidelines			1
taking care of @entity2 patients is tricky , because certain procedures might put doctors and nurses in contact with the patient 's infectious bodily fluids			1
at sunday 's press conference , @entity65 hinted that @entity84 might have performed two measures -- inserting a breathing tube and giving kidney dialysis -- that were unlikely to help @entity34			0
he described them as a " desperate measure " to save his life			0
" both of those procedures may spread contaminated materials and are considered high - risk procedures , " he said			0
" i 'm not familiar with any prior patient with @entity2 who has undergone either intubation or dialysis			2
" @entity92 said @entity10 should coordinate with medical groups to come up with treatment guidelines			2
" we could have and should have done it a few months ago , " he said			0
the @entity10 put too much trust in protective gear			2
once @entity34 was diagnosed , health authorities started making daily visits to 48 of his contacts			0
but that did n't include several dozen workers at @entity84 who took care of @entity34 after he was diagnosed			0
they were n't followed because they were wearing protective gear when they had contact with @entity34			0
instead , they monitored themselves			0
public health experts said that was a misstep , as the @entity10 should have realized that putting on and taking off protective gear is often done imperfectly and one of the workers might get an infection			1
how did @entity31 nurse contract @entity2 ? " we have to recognize that our safety work tells us that breaches of protocol are the norm , not the exception in health care , " said dr. @entity174 , senior vice president for patient safety and quality at @entity177			1
" we routinely break precautions			0
" @entity53 said that in this case , self - monitoring worked , but that monitoring from health officials can be beneficial , too , and so health care workers who were involved in @entity34 's care will now get daily visits from health authorities .			2

public health experts *question* some @entity10 actions on @entity2
patients are told to " call a doctor , " but expert says an ambulance would be better
not just any hospital can care for @entity2 patients , experts say
