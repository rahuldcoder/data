-- until this week , how many parents paid much attention to " @entity3 " ? he was a fictional villain in a wildly popular online game of hide and seek -- a tall , thin , and faceless monster with tentacle - like arms featured in web - based ghost stories created by and for horror story enthusiasts			1
but that 's where this story takes a very dark and tragic turn			0
with the arrest last weekend of two 12 - year - old girls in a suburb of @entity19 for the alleged stabbing and attempted murder of another 12 - year - old girl -- their friend -- it seems that the made - up meme could have inspired monstrous acts in real life			1
the young suspects were arrested after allegedly luring their innocent friend into the woods and stabbing her 19 times , according to authorities			0
and a criminal complaint says the suspects admitted they were trying to impress " @entity33 , " whom they read about on a horror website			2
but there is so much more to this story that parents and kids need to talk about			2
as the founder of a national nonprofit who has spent the last 10 years dedicated to helping kids and teens thrive in the digital world , here 's what i know is true : we are raising our children in a hyper - connected , always on , and ever - evolving media and technology landscape that offers many opportunities , yet many challenges for families			1
in effect , we are conducting an experiment on our children in real time , and how it turns out for them depends a lot on us			0
it 's very hard to keep up with what 's new and what 's popular with our kids , but the risks of not getting and staying involved in their digital lives is too high			2
here 's why : the world of media is a super peer			1
it can influence our kids ' social , emotional , cognitive , and physical development , and it can powerfully inform their sense of what 's normal and acceptable			1
stories , characters and their behavior in media -- whether in a video game , a movie , a tv show , or on a website -- can serve as role models , both good and bad			1
do you know what your kids are watching , reading , and doing online ? do you know who shares their conversations and who plays in their games ? and above all , are the media they 're choosing appropriate for their age and developmental stage ? mature content may not be suited to immature and developing minds , especially in children , who often can not comprehend the difference between reality and fantasy , and who can not understand the consequences of violent acts			1
media can be an amplifier in people , including children , who are at risk			1
much more research is needed on the impact of violent media on behavior			0
but existing research suggests that people who are prone to violent actions , or depression , or anxiety , feel those feelings more strongly , or may be motivated to act on them , when exposed to violent content			0
@entity123 also points to a correlation between repetitive viewing of violence and increased aggression and desensitization			0
the research is also uncovering a " reciprocal " relationship in which children with aggressive tendencies do , over time , seek out more violent media content and are even more affected by it than others , thus creating a downward spiral			2
@entity33 stabbing case : when can kids understand reality vs. fantasy ? parents are key to combating the negative effects of media			1
our children are exposed to a great deal of content that may not be worthy of their time and attention			0
even if your family limits certain unacceptable media at home , your kids can access that same content on any mobile device when they 're not at home or with you			2
that 's why it 's imperative to engage with them about the media they 're consuming			1
take the time to elicit your kids ' opinions on what 's popular and what they 're interested in , and share your opinions so as to help your kids develop the ability to view media critically and make choices that reflect your family 's values			1
every child and every family are different , so what works in my family may not work in yours			0
each of us has different pain points , different views on what 's appropriate , and different opinions on how much is too much			0
the reality for all of us , though , is that what happens online can influence what happens in real life			0
parenting needs to happen in both places			0
that way our kids can thrive , even in the face of a made - up monster in a dark and digital world .			0

@entity202 : until 12 - year - old 's stabbing , not many parents knew about " @entity33 "
@entity202 : internet is a super peer that guides kids ' development , informs sense of what 's normal
he says media can offer good or bad role models and amplify *problems* in at - risk kids
@entity202 : parents are key to combating negative media : engage with your children
