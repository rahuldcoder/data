" it 's been a huge honor to have represented my country and played all over the world			0
i look forward to playing my 200th @entity21 on home soil , as i call it a day , " the 40 - year - old said in a statement			1
@entity2 , who has played in a record 198 test matches , can reach the 200 mark in a two - match series against the @entity28 next month			1

" he is without doubt the greatest cricketer @entity3 has produced , " he said			0
" he has been an inspiration for generations of sportsmen not just cricketers			0
we respect his decision to retire although many of us ca n't imagine an @entity48 team without @entity2			2
" @entity2 , a right handed batsman , will go down in history for his incredible run scoring feats , including a record 15,837 runs to date in test matches , over 2,000 more than his closest rival , former @entity54 captain @entity53			1
in one - day internationals , @entity2 amassed 18,426 runs , nearly 5,000 runs clear of @entity53 's second best tally			1
@entity2 retired from one day internationals in december 2012 and an earlier announcement that this season would be his last in the lucrative @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , a @entity63 competition , paved the way for his decision thursday to retire from all forms of the game			1
fittingly , @entity2 helped the @entity69 franchise win this year 's @entity61 title and also played a key role as @entity3 won cricket 's @entity72 on home soil in 2011			2
