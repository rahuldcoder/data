@entity0 , @entity1 -- all @entity4 in the @entity5 are now " legitimate targets , " @entity3 in @entity1 announced wednesday , as the group 's deadline for @entity11 's @entity10 church to release alleged @entity13 female prisoners expired			1
an audio message released monday gave the church 48 hours to disclose the status of @entity13 women it said are imprisoned in @entity10 churches in @entity11			1
the message purportedly came from the @entity21 , which claimed responsibility for an attack on a @entity0 church sunday that killed 58 people and wounded 75			1
the umbrella group includes a number of @entity29 extremist organizations and has ties to @entity3 in @entity1			1
the group said the women 's alleged plight was the reason it stormed the church			1
wednesday , the group released a new message saying , " the @entity37 of @entity21 declares that all the centers , organizations and bodies of @entity42 leaders and followers have become legitimate targets by the @entity45 , wherever our hands will reach them			0
" shortly after the message was released , @entity11 police sources confirmed that security has been reinforced at churches around the country			1
additional protection was also being provided to the head of the @entity55 , pope @entity56 , who is scheduled to give a sermon in @entity59 in the evening , according to a police spokesman who could not be named in line with policy			0
@entity10 are adherents of an @entity11 sect of @entity66			2
about nine percent of @entity11 are @entity10 , according to the @entity67 ; 90 percent of @entity11 are @entity13			2
" this is a matter of extreme seriousness and we should not underestimate the threat , " said @entity68 , editor - in - chief of @entity69 , a weekly @entity10 newspaper published in @entity59			0
" we have to keep our eyes wide open and take all measures to ensure that our buildings and churches are not infiltrated			0
" @entity68 said he was encouraged by the security measures taken by the @entity11 government , as well as by the position taken by political forces in @entity11 , including the @entity83 , which has condemned the attack on the church in @entity0 and condemned threats against @entity11 copts			1
worshippers at the @entity85 in @entity0 were about to begin sunday night services when gunmen entered the church , according to @entity92 , a journalist for @entity95 's @entity94 newspaper , who was at the scene			1
as many as 120 people were taken hostage , said lt. col. @entity99 , a @entity100 military spokesman			0
the gunmen held them for hours before security forces stormed in to end the standoff , arresting eight suspects			0
most of the hostages were killed or wounded when the attackers set off explosives inside the church , @entity1 defense minister @entity106 said			2
at least two of the attackers were wearing explosive vests , which they detonated just minutes before security forces raided the church , police officials said			0
the gunmen were demanding that the @entity1 government release a number of detainees and prisoners in @entity1 prisons , saying the @entity42 hostages would be freed in return , according to the police officials			2
@entity1 's defense minister later said on state television that the kidnappers had demanded the release of a number of prisoners in both @entity1 and @entity11			1
" the sword of slaughter will not be lifted off the necks of their followers until they denounce what the dog of the @entity11 church has committed , and until they show the @entity45 their serious endeavor to pressure the combatant ( @entity10 ) church for the release of our @entity13 sisters , who are captive in the prisons of their monateries , " the militant group said wednesday			1
the group 's claim that the @entity55 in @entity11 is holding female prisoners is based on widespread rumors of @entity10 women in @entity11 converting to @entity155 and being detained by the church in an attempt to compel or persuade them to return to their original faith			1
both the @entity161 and the representatives of the @entity55 in @entity59 declined to comment on the matter			0
as for @entity4 , the chairman of the @entity165 , said wednesday they face " a grave terrorist threat			0
" @entity167 said @entity4 are among the country 's " smallest religious minorities , " which face a " pattern of official discrimination , marginalization and neglect			0
" @entity165 , an independent , bipartisan @entity100 federal government commission , reviews violations of religious freedom internationally and makes policy recommendations to the administration and @entity178			0
" it also is time for the @entity181 administration to acknowledge the sectarian aspects of the conflict in @entity1 , which are evident in this attack , and ensure that @entity100 - @entity1 policy prioritizes the plight of the country 's vulnerable religious minority communities , " @entity167 said			1
" @entity178 already has taken this step , as reflected in @entity191 and @entity192 resolutions that call on the @entity100 government to , among other measures , work with the @entity1 government to enhance security at places of worship and ensure that members of ethnic and religious minority communities do not suffer discrimination and can effectively convey their concerns to government			2
the administration should act accordingly as quickly as possible			0
" @entity2 's @entity206 in @entity207 , @entity208 , and @entity209 in @entity59 , @entity11 , contributed to this report .			2
