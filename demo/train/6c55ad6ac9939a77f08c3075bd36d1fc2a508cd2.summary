-- the @entity1 has arrested three @entity3 , @entity4 , police patrol officers and one sergeant for their alleged role in the mistreatment of @entity8 -- the first arrests to stem from a federal investigation into racial profiling in that town			1
the men allegedly threatened and assaulted detainees , made false arrests -- including one against a local clergy member -- and later conspired to cover up evidence of their conduct by falsifying reports and blocking an investigation , prosecutors said tuesday during a news conference in @entity23			2
sgt. @entity24 and officers @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 were arrested early tuesday for allegedly conspiring to " injure , oppress , threaten , and intimidate various members of the @entity3 community , " profiling residents during traffic stops , performing illegal searches and harassing latino business owners and their advocates , according to the indictment			1
" they behaved like bullies with badges , " said @entity37 , assistant @entity1 director in @entity38			1
on one occasion on january 21 , 2009 , @entity43 and @entity28 allegedly assaulted two individuals they had arrested under false pretenses , slamming their heads against the station 's cell block walls , the indictment said			2
the indictment cited a similar incident in which @entity24 allegedly struck a detainee who was handcuffed after being propped up by two other patrol officers			1
the men also dismissed a police commission inquiry into their alleged misconduct , it said , calling on the support of local union leaders to block and intimidate municipal investigators			0
the defendants could not be immediately reached for comment , and the @entity63 referred press inquiries to the mayor 's office			1
" it 's unfortunate that it had to come to arrests , " said mayor @entity70 , who said his office " stands behind the @entity63			1
" " they 're innocent until proven guilty , " he said			0
@entity70 , in an interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity74 , indicated that he saw no problem with not having any @entity8 on the @entity3 police force			1
when asked what he would do for the @entity79 community on tuesday , @entity70 said , " i might have tacos when i go home , i 'm not quite sure yet			1
" the arrests come just weeks after a scathing @entity84 report , derived from an investigation that began in september 2009 , accusing the town 's police of engaging in " discriminatory policing against @entity8			1
" in a letter to @entity70 , assistant u.s. attorney general @entity89 said the practice was " deeply rooted in the department 's culture , " citing statistical analysis that showed @entity8 had been " intentionally targeted " for traffic stops			0
the letter provided an example of a particular officer 's stops , 40.5 % of which were of @entity79 drivers			0
overall , the investigation found that 19.9 % of traffic stops made by @entity3 police were against @entity79 drivers , concluding it " shows pervasive discrimination against @entity8 on every level of @entity107 traffic enforcement activity			1
" the report also accused some officers of conducting unauthorized immigration investigations			2
it mentioned " numerous incident reports " in which officers contacted @entity115 to check on the status or seek an immigration detention of a @entity79			0
investigators said the tactic was " used to harass and intimidate @entity8 rather than pursue legitimate law enforcement objectives			0
" but @entity70 said he does n't believe allegations of such systemic discrimination in @entity3 are accurate			2
" we have an open community here , " he said			0
@entity70 elaborated in a news release : " @entity127 of @entity3 is prepared to do all that is necessary to address the consequences of this morning 's grand jury indictment			1
while the @entity127 has several factors to consider , the most important priority is ensuring the continued protection of our @entity127 's residents			0
to that end , i met with several shifts of officers at our @entity138 this morning to ensure that police service to our @entity127 would not be interrupted today and moving forward			2
" according to 2010 census data , @entity3 has a population of some 29,000 people , with about 10.3 % identifying as @entity143 or @entity79			2
the vast majority of residents , 88.5 % , are white , while close to 3 % identify as black or @entity146			0
still , @entity70 said , there have been changes in the wake of the december report			0
an independent commission of community members , external consultants and former law enforcement officials has been formed to head off future allegations by revising police policies			0
the mayor cited a series of reforms , including revisions to complaint review policies and training , and pointed to a revised @entity3 police handbook , the first update since 1972			1
" it was an outdated book , " @entity70 said .			0

new : mayor 's *reaction* to @entity0 affiliate : " i might have tacos when i go home "
" they behaved like bullies with badges , " an @entity1 official says
