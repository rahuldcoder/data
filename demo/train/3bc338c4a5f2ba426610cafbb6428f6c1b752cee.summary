@entity0 , @entity1 -- at least 18 people have been killed and 80 injured in a car bomb blast in central @entity0 as deadly violence returned to the streets of the @entity1 capital for a second day			1

tuesday 's attack followed three vehicle bombings near hotels in the city on monday which killed 36 people and wounded 71 others			1
the latest bombings come amid concerns over security and fears of a fresh wave of sectarian violence between the country 's @entity25 and @entity28 factions as the country prepares for crucial national elections on march 7			2
the buildup to that vote has been dominated by controversy over the legitimacy of hundreds of candidates banned from participating because of alleged links to former dictator @entity38 's regime			2
the 511 - name " blacklist " issued by @entity1 's @entity42 , which is charged with purging former members of @entity38 's @entity44 from public life , includes many prominent @entity28 @entity40 politicians			0
