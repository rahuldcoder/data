@entity0 -- a 9 - year - old boy 's request to have " @entity8 " listed as the place of birth on his @entity7 passport was met with wariness by the @entity7 @entity10 on monday			1
@entity11 was born in @entity12 , a disputed region in the eyes of the @entity15 administration , which argued in court the larger issue should be resolved by bilateral negotiations , not by a 2002 federal law favoring the family and 50,000 other @entity7 born in the holy city			1
the case is a classic fight between congressional and executive authority , with foreign policy the source of the current controversy			1
while the justices appeared ready to rule against the @entity30 , they also indicated concern about the president having either near - absolute control or a weaker influence over diplomatic and international relations , with many on the bench suggesting a middle - ground approach sure to displease both sides			1
justice @entity40 expressed concern that the congressionally - approved law giving @entity7 the discretion to change " @entity12 " on current passports to " @entity8 " offers a " cramped " view of the president 's power to conduct foreign policy amid undue congressional interference			1
but justice @entity48 worried whether the president " was entitled to ignore @entity49 " in the international arena , suggesting it was an " unsettling " idea			2
at issue are two questions , one narrow , one broad : can courts intervene to enforce a federal law explicitly directing the @entity57 how to record the birthplace of an @entity7 citizen on a passport ? and does the law impermissibly infringe on the president 's power to recognize a foreign sovereign ? " there have been 50,000 americans in the last 10 years that were born in @entity12 , and many of them would like to have @entity8 indicated as their place of birth in the passports , " said @entity64 , a @entity65 professor , and until recently a counselor on international law at the @entity57			1
" but this is also an extremely important geopolitical issue and a very sensitive foreign relations issue for the @entity7			2
" the high court case is @entity11 v. @entity78 , but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world , and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence : @entity12			1
its name translates as " @entity87 " to some , " @entity88 " to others			2
it is @entity8 's largest city and its capital , though that is not recognized by the @entity94 and most of the world community			1
the city is home to @entity98 and @entity99			1
the couple and their two oldest children were born in the @entity7 , but the family migrated to @entity12 a decade ago , and in 2002 the youngest , @entity104 was born			1
" we 're very proud of the fact that he was born in @entity8 and that we live in @entity8 and it 's the modern state of @entity8 , " @entity105 told @entity1 correspondent @entity106			1
" religiously and historically , that 's very significant			2
" the family attended the court session and were cautiously optimistic they would prevail			2
just three weeks before @entity11 was born , the @entity49 gave @entity7 citizens born in @entity12 the individual discretion to ask that @entity8 be listed on passports and consular reports , where it says " @entity118			1
" president @entity119 signed the bill , but issued an executive " signing statement " indicating he would not comply			2
that law , and the @entity11 's long - standing request were at the center of the 70 - minute argument			2
justice @entity126 wondered whether the court should be involved in a dispute between the other two branches of federal government			2
" it seems to me you are not arguing for a co-equal congressional power , you are arguing for a superior congressional power , " he told the @entity11 's lawyer @entity131			2
" you are saying whatever @entity49 says , the president has to comply with			0
now , that 's quite different from saying that they both have authority in the field			0
and if they both have authority in the field and they are exercising it in different fashions , i frankly would not be inclined to intervene			0
" @entity48 took another approach			0
" what happens if there is a peace accord tomorrow , and @entity8 gives up any claim to sovereignty over @entity12 ? is the president free to stop listing @entity8 on the passport ? or does he have to wait for @entity49 to change the law ? " " i think he does have to wait for @entity49 to change the law , " replied @entity131			1
" so you are hobbling the president with respect to situations that occur frequently , as happened in @entity159 , sometimes overnight			0
" a popular uprising there and nearby @entity162 resulted in two longstanding regimes being overthrown , which the @entity15 administration both supported and tentatively recognized as the new ruling authorities			0
@entity166 , the @entity167 's new solicitor general , offered a sweeping view of presidential power in his argument to the court			0
" under the @entity172 that is an exercise of the @entity174 's exclusive recognition power , " he said			0
" the @entity172 commits that power exclusively to the executive and neither a court nor the @entity49 can override that judgment			0
" several on the bench offered their doubts			0
justice @entity182 somewhat skeptically wondered whether the court should be held back from answering the broader question of presidential authority			1
" why not all the way ? i mean , if the ( @entity10 ) @entity10 decides that the @entity172 commits this authority exclusively to the president , then it 's all over , " she said			1
" that 's the merits of the case : does the president have this authority ? " justice @entity195 added it would depend on the kind of authority asserted			0
" if the question is whether the president has exclusive authority with respect to the formal recognition of a foreign country , that might be one thing , " he said			1
" but what if the question is whether the president has exclusive jurisdiction -- plenary authority , unreviewable authority -- with respect to anything that the president thinks has a bearing on the question of recognition ? " the tone of his question suggested he thought the government was reaching too far			1
@entity166 said the government was not taking that power that far , but said courts should give " a very significant measure of deference " to the @entity227 and @entity57			0
@entity126 hypothesized whether @entity49 could try and block the president from recognizing a breakaway province of a foreign sovereign , which could prompt a @entity7 war with that country			0
even if the president were " foolish " to do so -- in @entity126 's words -- @entity166 said that was still the president 's prerogative			0
" our cases say repeatedly that the president is the sole instrument of the @entity7 for the conduct of foreign policy , but to be the sole instrument and to determine the foreign policy are two quite different things , " said @entity126			0
" but it does n't necessarily mean that the president determines everything in foreign policy ... there is certainly room ... for saying that @entity49 can say what the country 's instrument is supposed to do			1
" this case is the first substantive look at a president 's " inherent " authority since a series of cases over the @entity119 administration 's war on terror since the 9/11 attacks , and the power to detain suspected " enemy combatants			0
" several high court rulings restricted the military 's authority to detain suspected terrorists without access to federal courts to contest their overseas imprisonment			0
a ruling in the @entity11 appeal is expected sometime before june			0
the case is @entity78 ( 10 - 699 ) .			0

the @entity10 is wary on a passport question
*people* born in @entity12 ca n't list @entity8 as their place of birth
the city is claimed by both @entity8 and @entity287
