-- a top @entity2 official warned @entity4 's education department that the state 's controversial immigration law has had " lasting " and possibly illegal consequences for @entity9 school children , according to a letter released thursday			1
" ( the law has ) diminished access to and quality of education for many of @entity4 's @entity9 children , resulted in missed school days , chilled or prevented the participation of parents in their children 's education , and transformed the climates of some schools into less safe and welcoming spaces for @entity9 children , " wrote assistant attorney general @entity11 , head of the federal department 's @entity12			1
the legislation , known as @entity30 , has several provisions , including one requiring police who make lawful traffic stops or arrests to try to determine the immigration status of anyone they suspect might be in the country illegally			0
a federal appeals court has blocked some components , however , including one requiring @entity4 officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools			1
even with such changes mandated by the courts and others proposed by legislators , @entity11 argues in a letter to state superintendent of education @entity51 that the bill already has had negative effects			2
he points to data provided by @entity4 officials that , he says , shows that " hispanic students absence rates tripled while absence rates for other groups of students remained virtually flat			2
" that includes a sharp drop in those getting schooling through @entity64 as a second language programs , meaning they did not " receive the educational services to which they are legally entitled			0
" @entity11 also writes that " the rate of total withdrawals of @entity9 children substantially increased , " with 13.4 % of such children having dropped out between the beginning of the current school year and this february			2
" there was no immediate comment thursday night from the state about @entity11 's letter			2
three weeks ago , state @entity80 spokeswoman @entity79 said that when the law went into effect last september , there were about 1,200 daily absences more than normal of @entity9 students			1
this compares to a normal absentee rate of about 900 to 1,000 students			0
in mid-march , that number was 1,478 absences among @entity91 and the number fell to 1,340 in april , said @entity93			2
notably , the @entity4 law as written allows students to be questioned on their immigration status , though this information was not intended to deny them enrollment in public schools			1
one of the bill 's authors , state sen. @entity102 , defended the idea of checking students ' legal status			0
" i think it 's important that we gather that data , " said @entity102 , a @entity106 like most of the members of the state 's legislature			1
" i do n't think there 's anything inherently wrong with collecting the data , and i think the courts will agree			0
" nearly 99 % of all @entity4 k - 12 public school students are @entity118 citizens , said @entity11			0
and many of those of @entity9 origin feel " unwelcome in schools they had attended for years , " he added , basing these comments on interviews with students , parents , teachers and administrators			1
many reported " being singled out to receive notices or attend assemblies about @entity30 , " as well as " increased anxiety and diminished concentration in school , deteriorating grades and increased hostility , bullying and intimidation , " said the civil rights division chief			1
@entity11 noted the @entity118 @entity2 's duty to enforce laws that bar " discrimination on the basis of race , color or national origin , " and requirements that " affirmative measures " be taken to assist students for whom @entity64 is n't their native language			1
" further , the @entity152 held ( in a 1982 case ) that a state may not deny a child equal access to public education based on his or her immigration status , " he said			0
several supporters of the law , including gov. @entity162 , have suggested changes to the law -- considered one of the toughest in the country , along with @entity168 's landmark legislation -- but have been adamant that the core of it remain in tact			0
@entity172 , a spokesman to house speaker @entity173 , said late last year that such discussions dealt with improving the law , " clearing up misconceptions and correcting any portions that might be vague or require additional definitions			0
" " make no mistake , the legislature is not going to repeal this law and have @entity4 become a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants , " @entity178 said			1
@entity0 's @entity93 contributed to this report .			0
