@entity0 -- congressional @entity2 offered what they call a " centrist , practical " plan to overhaul the @entity6 health care system tuesday , one they say would be the cheapest of any option proposed so far			2
@entity9 @entity2 say their health care plan is a better package than the @entity13 version			1
@entity15 rep. @entity14 said the package put together by moderate @entity2 in the @entity9 would be far cheaper than a plan being drawn up in the @entity13			1
a preliminary review of that plan by the @entity20 found it would cost about $ 1 trillion over 10 years to extend health insurance to 16 million people who otherwise would not be covered -- about a third of the roughly 45 million now uninsured			1
" i think this plan that we put forward is more centrist , more bipartisan and would be at significantly lower cost , " @entity14 said			1
he said no cost estimate had been prepared for the measures he put forth tuesday , but asserted its elements would require less money from taxpayers than other proposals			0
the package announced by the @entity36 " includes some perennial @entity2 favorites such as regulatory relief , an individual tax break for purchasing health insurance and limits on malpractice lawsuits			2
it also would encourage insurers to pool their coverage to a greater extent than currently allowed , which @entity14 and other supporters say has worked well in @entity48			2
but it also emphasizes preventive care , computerizing patient records and reducing " defensive medicine " by promoting treatments proven effective -- all principles the @entity54 has endorsed , as well			0
the centerpiece of the plan , @entity14 said , is a " @entity58 " that would keep government out of " decisions made by you and your doctor			1
" he said the plans were drawn up during four months of talks with dozens of groups , including patient advocates , doctors , nurses , employers and " other interested groups			0
" the proposal came as the conservative @entity36 leadership in the @entity9 stepped up attacks on the proposal being drafted by @entity75			1
@entity9 minority leader @entity76 , @entity77 , said monday 's budget office report showed " millions of @entity6 " would lose their current insurance			0
" president @entity82 says the problem with our health care is that we spend too much , and if you look at all the proposals , clearly they are going to spend trillions of dollars of additional money that we do n't have -- that we 're going to have to borrow -- in order to finance their scheme , " @entity76 told reporters			0
the report projected that the number of people covered by employer - based health care plans would fall by about 15 million by 2017			0
in the same year , about 39 million people would be covered by policies purchased through a health insurance " exchange " of the type @entity82 has proposed			0
@entity54 spokesman @entity103 told reporters tuesday that a bill is still being drafted and " has many twists and turns to go			1
" " one incomplete older proposal i do n't think is indicative of where we are now , " he said .			0
