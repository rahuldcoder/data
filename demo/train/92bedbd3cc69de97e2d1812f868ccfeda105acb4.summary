the so - called war on women that @entity2 love to talk about on the campaign trail may be losing some of its luster			1
the attack line -- aimed at painting @entity6 as out of sync with women on contraception , abortion and other issues -- is n't resonating like in 2012 , when @entity2 hurled it at the @entity6 with a devastating effect			1
instead , republicans have improved their standing among women during this election cycle , narrowing the gender gap in key races that could decide control of the @entity21			2
the dynamic reflects the painstaking efforts among @entity6 to avoid the mistakes of 2012			1
this time around , there are n't any candidates talking about " legitimate rape " or " binders full of women			1
" and the @entity6 put up strong female candidates in states like @entity32 and @entity33 , making it harder for @entity2 to attack them as opposed to the interests of women			1
the strategy seems to be paying off			0
" the gender gap is smaller when republicans do n't make mistakes , " said @entity38 , director of the @entity39 at @entity40			1
" republicans this time have managed to neutralize their deficiencies in this area so the war on women rhetoric does not resonate so much			1
" @entity50 , president of the @entity51 , said @entity6 are riding a " perfect storm " in @entity21 races in red states as they enjoy the knock - on effect of national factors like @entity56 and @entity57 , which have overshadowed social issues			1
" they have learned their lessons from 2012 , " she said			0
still , democrats are n't toning down the rhetoric			2
an attack ad by @entity2 sen. @entity65 warns that the only place his opponent @entity67 will take @entity69 women is backwards , and accused him of waging an " eight year crusade that would ban birth control			1
" another @entity65 spot features a female gynecologist and obstetrician complaining that @entity67 sponsored harsh anti-abortion laws			0
the barrage has prompted @entity6 backing @entity67 to brand @entity77 " — a phrase that was even picked up by a moderator in a @entity69 @entity21 debate this month			2
despite the attacks , polls show abortion and contraception are not decisive issues in their tight race — reflecting data that shows the core @entity2 constituency of young unmarried women often tune out the mid-terms			1
in a @entity93 poll last week , women picked @entity65 by 45 % to 41 %			0
but men back @entity67 by 51 % to 38 % giving the @entity6 a five point lead in the race overall			2
it 's a similar story in @entity98 , where the incumbent @entity99 is tied or just behind among women with @entity6 @entity101 , but is down about 15 points or more among men			1
the @entity104 launched a " @entity106 " tour through the state this month , and has put up @entity109 videos slamming @entity101 for " insulting " views on women			0
in june , a @entity99 ad featured a woman identified as " @entity114 " who asked " who is this guy and what has he got against women ? " in @entity32 , republicans are savoring the strong showing of @entity120 , who leads democrat @entity121 despite assaults on her position on abortion , which she opposes			1
@entity125 , a @entity127 riding @entity126 veteran has built a tough political persona after turning around her campaign in an ad in which she spoke of castrating hogs on an @entity32 farm			2
recent polls reveal a " reverse gender gap " as the male candidate @entity121 leads the female @entity120 among women but trails further behind among men			2
@entity125 knew what was coming : " soon we 'll be hearing about the war on women , " she predicted after winning her primary , and warned @entity2 she knows what real war is like			1
@entity147 , a @entity6 @entity21 candidate in @entity33 , also went on the offensive			1
" as a woman , i might know a little bit more about women than @entity155 , " @entity147 said in an ad , as she sat in a living room and sipped from a coffee cup			0
in @entity157 , senate republican leader @entity156 showcased his wife , former labor secretary @entity158 as he parried claims by @entity104 @entity160 that he is anti-women			0
in a new @entity163 ad this week , young women hammer @entity160 with the message : " she thinks i will vote for the candidate who looks like me , rather than the one who represents me			0
" in the latest @entity168 for the @entity169 , @entity163 is in a statistical tie with @entity160 among women voters while maintaining a one point lead overall			0
@entity6 have not closed the gender gap everywhere			2
and where they are struggling , the @entity2 focus on women 's economic issues may be the reason			1
watch : these nerds can elect anyone in @entity182 , @entity2 sen. @entity181 slammed her @entity6 foe @entity183 for branding federal equal pay legislation a " gimmick			1
" her lead among women was 11 percent in a margin - of - error race , according to a @entity191 poll last week			0
@entity192 , the former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential contender , hit women 's issues hard when she campaigned with @entity181 in @entity196 on saturday , beseeching an 1,800 strong crowd to reach out to " every single woman			2
" " women 's rights are the canary in the coal mine			0
if you do n't protect women 's rights here at home and around the world , everybody 's rights are lost , " @entity202 said			0
in @entity210 , democrat @entity209 highlighted workplace fairness to widen her attack on @entity6 @entity214 's business record			0
a new @entity216 poll released friday put her lead among women voters at a gaping 18 percent			0
in each of these races , the rhetoric aimed at women is often more focused on pocketbook issues as opposed to the more hot - button subjects of abortion and contraception			1
@entity226 , director of the @entity227 at @entity228 , said women voters may simply not be seeing enough from @entity2 to get them out to vote			2
there 's a paradox here			0
@entity233 's low approval ratings are dragging down vulnerable @entity2			0
but the fact he 's not in the national spotlight drawing a clear choice on women 's issues with an opponent like @entity241 is making it more difficult to crystallize the arguments			0
" the bigger challenge that the @entity2 are facing this time may or may not be about whether the @entity6 are appealing more to women — but the @entity2 are not inspiring or turning out the women , " said @entity226			1
while @entity6 may be doing better — it 's too early to say that they are winning back what will be a decisive demographic in 2016			0
the gender gap was smaller than usual in many races but the party fell back again when the @entity254 was on the ballot			0
@entity6 prospects may also suffer if @entity2 nominate @entity202 , a candidate with historic possibility even for some women who may otherwise balk at voting for @entity2			1
" her mere presence signifies the women 's issue , " said @entity38			0
and sometimes , @entity6 rhetoric towards women still seems a little dated			1
in a digital ad aimed at young women this month , the @entity265 compared picking out a gubernatorial candidate to choosing a wedding gown			0
the @entity270 said that proved @entity6 " still have no idea how to communicate with women voters			2

@entity2 rhetoric aimed at women is n't resonating as well as it did in 2012
republicans are avoiding the mistakes they made with women in 2012
the @entity6 is putting up strong female candidates in states like @entity32 and @entity33
