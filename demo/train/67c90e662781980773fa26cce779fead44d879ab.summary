, a new and quick - spreading deadly virus that began in @entity4 and took just weeks to spread to 37 different countries			2
perhaps the illness 's biggest legacy though is illustrating the speed and ease with which a disease can traverse the global travel network and how frequent flyers can often be in the front line			1
" they 're more exposed because they 're in contact with a higher number of ( potentially infected ) individuals , " says @entity14 of @entity15 , an expert in the spreading patterns of epidemics			0
" while traveling , they remain confined in a relatively small space , where they interact with other passengers that , again , might already be infected			1
" though passengers often consider a plane pumping recycled air as an incubator for disease , such a viewpoint is inaccurate , according to @entity34 , a spokesman from plane manufacturing company @entity35			1
only a portion of the air inside a plane is recirculated ; the rest is fresh air sourced from outside			1
the recycled air is passed through @entity42 ( @entity42 ) filters , which removes viruses , bacteria and dust			1
" because air is circulated vertically around each row and drawn out through under - seat floor vents , it can not move forward or aft			1
so the ability of viruses to transfer beyond a seat row is almost zero , " he adds			1

according to @entity65 , a spokesman at the @entity66 , " if frequent travelers are aware of the risks , and take the required precautions , they can minimize the risk of acquiring disease			1
" @entity67 , a medical consultant with the @entity68 , confirms that reading up on an area before setting off is one of the best ways to safeguard one 's health			1
" people need to be alert to pubic health messages and what 's emerging , be it @entity3 or @entity77 , " she says			1
she adds that disease prevention is n't too different abroad as it is on the ground			0
" do the same things you would at home to avoid illness , mainly , wash your hands frequently			1
you can pick things up on your hands that you can transfer by rubbing your eyes , or touching your face			0
" while epidemics attract the headlines sexually transmitted infections and vector - and food - borne illnesses still top the charts when it comes to mortality rates			0
" sometimes , when people are going to exotic places , they focus on strange diseases that do n't happen very often , like @entity102 , that are strong media contenders , when actually , influenza or malaria might be the biggest risk , " says @entity67			2
@entity108 , a reader in the geology and environmental science department at the @entity110 is the developer of vbd - air.com , a web tool developed for the @entity111 to help track the spread of mosquito - transmitted illnesses via air travel			2
he believes the most prevalent travel - related ailments are also avoidable			0
" most of the diseases people contract abroad are preventable			2
in some instances , it 's just a matter of getting the right vaccine , or wearing insecticide and sleeping under a bed net , " he says			0
" truthfully , outbreaks like @entity3 and @entity77 can be more difficult to avoid , because they can hit a city before you even know it			0
whereas you can lower the risks of diarrhoeal diseases ( which are among the most prevalent ) simply by being careful with drinking water and making sure all the food you eat is cooked			2
" @entity67 reiterates the point , adding that many traveler afflictions are also self - treatable			0
" if you have the right medication with you , you can feel better in a matter of minutes , instead of days , " she notes			0
she advises consulting a good travel doctor for a list of recommended vaccines and medications ( the @entity137 has a global directory online )			0
she also recommends venturing out to the drug store prior to travel			0
" go to your favorite pharmacy and walk up and down the aisles , and take the things off the shelf you 'd like to have at home , " she advises , adding that @entity141 and antibiotics are essential additions to any travel medical kit			2
really , though , the biggest suitcase essential is common sense , " which most people forget to pack when they travel , " she says .			0
