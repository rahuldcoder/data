-- soccer and technology do n't normally mix ; @entity3 , the international football body , has long dragged its studded heels over efforts to introduce microchip sensors into match refereeing			2
so when @entity8 based its entire @entity10 2022 bid on a dazzling display of computer wizardry that does n't yet exist , it was taking a gamble			1
@entity8 , which is vying with @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and the @entity17 for the 2022 tournament , will find out on december 2 whether its ambitious proposal paid off			1
but any sense of victory will be tempered by the herculean task the country now faces in trying to turn a package of ideas , which appear to be stolen wholesale from science fiction , into science fact			2
at the heart of @entity8 's bid is a plan to broadcast entire games to stadiums on the other side of the world in what appears to be life - sized holograms			1
promotional videos shown on the 2022 bid website show ghostly players chasing the ball while crowds of fans look on -- reminiscent of the classic princess @entity45 hologram scene in " @entity46			1
" @entity8 organizers say each game will be filmed by 200 high definition cameras , which will use " freeviewpoint " technology to allow fans to see the action unfold from a player 's eye view -- the kind of images until now only seen in video games			1
meanwhile on the terraces , supporters will be able to use in - ear computerized translators to talk freely to fans from other countries -- a device that mimics the " @entity66 's " universal translators or the @entity64 of " @entity65			1
" " we think that now it 's time to give something back to the world , and our starting point is to deliver the joy of football not only to the hosting country but all over the world , " says @entity67 , director of the 2022 bid committee			1
but can @entity8 actually deliver on these fantastic promises ? and will they really enhance the enjoyment of what is already known as the beautiful game ? with limited information on how they intend to achieve their goals , leading scientists in the field of three dimensional and holographic television have been left slightly perplexed over the proposals			1
" the ' freeviewpoint ' is definitely going to be feasible , there 's a lot of work being done on that , " said @entity89 , a scientist working on 3d television projects at @entity92 's @entity91 in @entity93			2
" but the rest is rather speculative			0
" while 3d broadcasts that do n't rely on special glasses ( known as auto - stereoscopic television ) are currently possible , these involve projecting twin images directly at individuals			0
viewers must remain in one spot or wear tracking devices to ensure the images are beamed at them			0
says @entity89 , while this is possible for small groups , it 's tricky on a larger scale			0
" i really ca n't see how that can be done , " he told @entity0			0
professor @entity115 , a 3d television expert at @entity117 , agreed it was unlikely on a large scale			0
" there has to be head tracking , so if you move your head the images has to move with you and you 're not going to keep your head in position during a football match -- you 're going to jump up and down , particularly if your home team scores			0
" there 's also an obstacle with nausea , some people looking at these autostereoscopic displays can become disorientated , there are human factors like that which have to be taken into account			0
" professor @entity138 , whose team at the @entity140 recently succeeded in producing rudimentary moving holographic images , is more optimistic			0
" this is very aggressive planning , but i actually like it because they put a stick in the ground			0
but they are proposing something that does n't exist right now and they 're proposing to do it in 12 years , " he told @entity0			0
" i believe it is achievable , the only question that remains to me is is it going to be affordable to the public ? " but what will the fans think ? says @entity155 , football obsessive and author of " inverting the @entity158 : a history of @entity164 , " they 'll love it , but only if they really care about the game			1
" speaking as a tactics geek , the problem watching games on television is it 's very hard to see the shape of the teams so if you 're trying to assess the way the game 's going , if you 're trying to assess the space , how a team 's shape 's doing and their defense and organization , then this will clearly be beneficial			2
" whether most fans will care about this i do n't know			2
" while real - time language interpretation might be more achievable given that computers are already capable of handling basic translations , linguists speculate they could have trouble handling football 's unique vernacular			1
says @entity190 , who runs a language website that focuses on the phraseology of football , the idioms deployed by fans are often baffling to speakers of the same language			2
" some of my @entity197 colleagues have difficulty with certain football phrases such as ' early doors ; ' ' gatecrash the top four ' and , of course , why is it that parrots are the sickest of all creatures ? " he told @entity0			0
despite the ambitious scope of the 2022 proposal , there is one problem that not even @entity8 's scientists have come up with a solution to : how to silence to @entity213 .			1

@entity8 says it will broadcast @entity10 2022 games in " full court " @entity216
proposal *includes* real time translators for fans to talk to each other
scientists say they are unsure whether ambitious promises could be realized
