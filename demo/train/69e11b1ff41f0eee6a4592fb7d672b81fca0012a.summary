@entity0 -- the leader of a @entity0 - based @entity4 group said he felt " gut - punched " by a televised report in which two men alleged a former coach with that organization had sexually abused them as boys			1
@entity11 , the president and ceo of the @entity4 of @entity0 and the @entity13 , said he first heard of the allegations against @entity15 while watching @entity17 's " @entity18 " program on sunday			1
he said the sports network did n't contact him in advance of the piece			0
as of monday , several days after @entity23 director @entity22 announced his department would investigate the claims against @entity15 , @entity11 said that law enforcement had not touched base with his @entity4 organization			1
in the @entity17 report , @entity15 's accusers said he sexually abused them in hotel rooms during tournaments when they were 12 to 16 years old			1
@entity1 has not been able to reach @entity15 , 63 , for comment on the allegations			1
@entity17 said it also had been unable to reach him			0
on monday afternoon , @entity0 police deputy chief @entity36 said the investigators ' options are limited given that no one has filed a formal complaint against @entity15			1
" a person is going to have to actually come to the police and report this , " @entity36 told reporters			2
" the fact they go on tv and make these accusations is not notifying the authorities			1
" @entity36 said police are still trying to determine " where ( the alleged crimes ) happened , when they happened and who was involved			0
" but if a person does n't offer details directly to police , there are only " going to be a lot of baby steps , " he said			0
@entity15 , who is not a direct relative of the late former @entity63 football coach of the same name , was a basketball coach affiliated with the @entity4 in the 1980s , @entity11 confirmed			1
two now grown men alleged in the @entity17 report that @entity15 abused them during that time			1
the allegations were made amid child sex scandals at @entity70 and @entity71 universities and @entity72			0
both men accusing @entity15 told @entity17 the publicity from the scandals prompted them to act			1
the @entity4 said @entity15 left in 1992 " to pursue @entity80 sports full - time , " including founding an organization called the @entity77 , which stands for @entity78 and is unrelated to the @entity4			1
he eventually became president and ceo of the @entity80 , a position he held until his dismissal on november 14			1
@entity11 came to @entity0 as head of the @entity86 a year after @entity15 left			1
in his time with the organization , including over the last decade as an executive for the regional @entity4 , @entity11 said he had never heard complaints regarding the former coach			1
@entity36 said that @entity0 police began looking into the case after the aau gave them information last friday			1
@entity80 spokesman @entity95 had also said that his organization kick - started the child sex abuse criminal probe -- although the group has varied as to whether it claims to have contacted authorities last thursday or friday -- telling @entity1 that the organization provided the identities of three of @entity15 's accusers , including not brought up in the @entity17 report			1
this disclosure followed a nearly monthlong investigation ordered by the @entity80 , @entity95 said sunday			2
the aau got " cryptic , brief " e-mails , signed only as " shrimp breath , " on november 7 , 8 and 9 that " alleged , in a very general way , that @entity110 engaged in child sexual abuse , " @entity95 said			0
on november 9 , the organization got two brief voice - mails along the same lines			0
there was no name or contact information left in either case			0
those messages were sent to the aau 's compliance and general counsel office , and @entity80 officers were notified on november 11			1
the board members , several of whom flew into @entity124 , convened the next monday , november 14 , " to confront then - president @entity110 , " said @entity95			0
in that meeting , @entity15 said he had gotten similar phone messages and said he was innocent , according to @entity95 , who said he had spoken with several @entity80 officers who were at the meeting			1
" despite those denials , the aau officers directed that @entity110 leave the premises and leave his position ( as president and ceo ) for an indefinite period , " said @entity95			0
the @entity4 of @entity0 and the @entity13 and the @entity80 have launched independent investigations into the matter , their respective leaders have said			1
one of @entity15 's accusers , identified by @entity17 as @entity141 of @entity142 , said he was 14 at the time of the alleged abuse			1
he said that he was talking publicly , despite the potential embarrassment to him and his family , not to " gain anything " but because he felt " the guy should n't be around kids anymore			0
" @entity141 said that he was on a ymca basketball team run by @entity15 , who he said would sometimes slip into his then player 's hotel room			1
asked how @entity15 could have entered the hotel room on that and other occasions , @entity141 said , " he had a key			2
he always somehow had a key to whatever room i was in			0
" @entity141 said @entity15 abused him or tried to abuse him six times , including at least once in which he tried " to put his hand in my boxer shorts " while @entity141 was sleeping			2
during out - of - town basketball tournaments , @entity141 said that he tried to find ways to keep @entity15 out of his hotel room , , adding he was " afraid to even fall asleep			1
" " he would push his way in the room and then end up , i 'd see , i would n't see him , i would hear him , he 'd lay at the floor of the bed masturbating , " @entity141 said			0
" and you just lay there horrified			0
but you do n't know what to do			0
what , are you going to blow the lid off of this at 14 years ? all you want to do is pretend it did n't happen and not address it at all			0
you want to hide and bury it			0
" another accuser , whom @entity17 did not identify , said @entity15 gave him alcohol before taking him to a bedroom and touching him inappropriately			2
" the last thing that i can really remember was him carrying me into his bedroom and i can remember him , you know , touching me in ways that i , i did n't uh , i did n't want another man touching me , " the man said			0
that accuser said he called @entity110 on november 11 and confronted him			0
@entity15 , he said , then apologized for the alleged abuse			2
the network said it examined the man 's phone records and verified an eight - minute phone call to @entity15 's number			1
both men said they had never reported the alleged incidents to police and had only recently told their families , @entity17 said			2
until they or other accusers contact @entity0 police , @entity36 said investigators can only work from the limited information they 've been given by the aau			1
" we 're just going to have to go with the facts , as they come forward , " he said			0
the statute of limitations , which mandates that charges can not be filed for a crime if a certain amount of time has elapsed since it allegedly took place , could be a factor in the case			0
@entity218 district attorney general @entity217 on monday said such laws are " very technical " and " very confusing , " declining to go into details as to how it would apply in this case lest that would prevent complainants from talking to police			0
" what we do n't want to do is encourage made - up claims or discourage valid claims to be made to the @entity23 , " @entity217 told reporters , encouraging victims of any crime to contact police and not worry about the statute of limitations			2
@entity95 criticized the half - hour @entity17 report for not quoting @entity80 president @entity236 's video statement on the matter or others from the aau			1
the organization , which has 80,000 adult volunteers involved in coaching and works with hundreds of thousands of young people , is asking outside experts to review its policies for protecting children , which @entity95 called the aau 's " no. 1 priority			0
" the spokesman also clarified that @entity15 told his successor , @entity236 , that he had colon cancer and needed surgery after his dismissal			2
@entity15 allegedly asked that he be able to retire for medical reasons , a request that @entity236 denied , according to @entity255			2
" ( @entity236 ) told mr. @entity15 to go focus on your health , go through this surgery and we 'll deal with this issue later , " said @entity95			2
@entity15 has been back at the aau 's offices one time since his ouster , contrary to the organization 's earlier reports that he had not returned			1
the occasion was a " forensic audit " that @entity95 called standard for outgoing leaders of organizations			0
" @entity110 is no longer part of the @entity80 , " said @entity95			2
" he has no continuing role ( or ) involvement in their programs			0
there 's no contact with him			0
whatever compensation he would have been entitled to -- accrued vacation time -- will be paid , and that 's it			2

@entity0 police says no accusers have contacted them , making their probe *challenging*
going " on tv and ( making ) accusations is not notifying " police , a deputy chief says
