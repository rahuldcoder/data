-- three - time champions @entity1 finished third for the second successive @entity3 after coming from behind to defeat @entity4 3 - 2 in @entity5 on saturday night			1
@entity6 headed the winning goal with eight minutes to play as @entity9 's much - changed team won the bronze - medal match in @entity11			1
" of course we had all hoped for something better , but this match for third place was also a final that we absolutely wanted to win , " @entity6 said , @entity12 reported			0
" at this @entity3 we were a very young team and we 've put down a marker			0
but we obviously want to win more in the future			0
" @entity19 put @entity1 ahead in the 19th minute on his return from suspension after missing the semifinal defeat by @entity23 , joining the tournament 's top scorers with his fifth goal of the competition			1
@entity28 leveled nine minutes later after @entity1 's stand - in captain @entity29 was dispossessed , and two - time champions @entity4 took the lead six minutes after the halftime interval as @entity34 also netted his fifth goal with a superb volley			1
@entity1 equalized five minutes later when @entity37 headed home after @entity4 goalkeeper @entity39 failed to cut out @entity41 's deep cross			1
@entity34 hit the @entity43 crossbar with the final play of the match from a stunning free - kick as the @entity47 finished the tournament on a losing note			2
" finishing among the top four teams is spectacular , " he said			0
" at the beginning we never thought we 'd taste a moment like this			0
we wanted to finish third , but we 'll remember the positives			0
" @entity9 left captain @entity56 and goalkeeper @entity57 on the substitutes ' bench along with four - goal striker @entity60 , who had been struggling with a back injury and missed out on the chance to join @entity64 's @entity63 as the all - time top @entity3 scorer on 15 overall			1
@entity56 's replacement @entity68 was lucky not to be sent off for a bad early tackle on @entity69 , but @entity1 had the ascendancy as @entity71 headed @entity73 's corner against the @entity4 crossbar in the 10th minute			1
the 20 - year - old @entity19 made no mistake as he pounced to score the opening goal after @entity39 was deceived by @entity29 's swerving shot and could only spill the ball into the @entity43 's path			2
it put the @entity82 player , who has represented his country only eight times , on five goals for the tournament along with @entity23 's @entity87 and @entity88 of the @entity89			1
if that duo fail to score in sunday 's final , @entity19 may win the award for top scorer as -- bizarrely -- assists are taken into account in the case of a tie , and he has three to their one			2
but @entity29 turned villain soon after when he was dispossessed by @entity69 , who fed @entity101 -- and the @entity4 striker found @entity28 with a well - timed pass which left veteran goalkeeper @entity104 exposed			2
@entity101 , returning from suspension , was booed by large sections of the crowd almost every time he touched the ball due to his deliberate handling on the line against @entity111 in the quarterfinals			0
with rain lashing down , he should have put @entity4 ahead just before halftime but screwed his shot wide of the post			0
the 36 - year - old @entity104 , whose third and previous international outing was in 2003 , did well to deny @entity28 and @entity101 after the break but could do nothing as @entity34 volleyed in a right - wing cross from @entity121 in the 51st minute			0
the lead did not last long as @entity39 was once again caught out , allowing @entity37 a free header after flailing at @entity41 's towering right - wing center			0
@entity6 gave 2002 runners - up @entity1 the lead in the 82nd minute as @entity4 failed to clear @entity73 's corner and the midfielder was able to place his header over the despairing @entity39			1
substitute @entity130 should have made it 4 - 2 but blazed his shot over the bar , then @entity34 almost took the match into extra-time when his ferocious free - kick boomed to safety off @entity104 's bar			1
the result meant that the octopus which had correctly predicted all of @entity1 's previous results at the tournament was right once again .			2

@entity6 heads late winner as @entity1 finish third at @entity3 in @entity11
the 2006 hosts come from behind to beat @entity4 3 - 2 in playoff in @entity5
