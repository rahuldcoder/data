@entity0 -- a handful of @entity4 senators have proposed a constitutional amendment to limit how long a person may serve in @entity7			1
currently , there are no term limits for federal lawmakers , but sen. @entity11 , @entity13 - @entity12 , and several of his colleagues are advocating that service in the @entity16 be limited to 12 years , while lawmakers would only be allowed to serve six years in the @entity18			1
" @entity21 know real change in @entity0 will never happen until we end the era of permanent politicians , " @entity11 said in a statement released by his office			0
" as long as members have the chance to spend their lives in @entity0 , their interests will always skew toward spending taxpayer dollars to buyoff special interests , covering over corruption in the bureaucracy , fundraising , relationship building among lobbyists , and trading favors for pork -- in short , amassing their own power			0
" two - thirds of the @entity18 and @entity16 would need to approve the amendment -- a stumbling block that short - circuited the idea 14 years ago			1
the new proposal echoes the @entity45 , part of the original contract with @entity21 proposed by @entity4 before they won control of @entity7 in 1994			0
that measure , which would have allowed both senators and members of the @entity18 to serve just 12 years , won a majority in the @entity4 - controlled @entity18 in 1995 , but failed because it did not meet the constitutionally - required two - thirds threshold			1
" there is no question there are big obstacles in the way , " said @entity54 , president of @entity55 , a nonpartisan organization that advocates putting time restrictions in place			0
" it is difficult to pass a constitutional amendment , however the goal is worthwhile and it is very important to the country			0
also , if not now , when ? " this time around , proponents are not calling on lawmakers who believe in the idea to place a self - imposed term limit on themselves			2
" if you are asking people to self - limit , what might happen -- and what did happen -- is that honorable politicians who made the pledge left office , " while others did not , @entity54 said			0
" the answer to the term - limit supporter is not self - limiting			0
it is the body as a whole			0
" @entity11 , who is currently serving his first six - year term in the @entity16 , echoed @entity54 's rationale for dismissing self - imposed term limits			1
" i want to be clear : demanding that reformers adopt self - imposed term limits is a recipe for self - defeat on this issue , " @entity11 said in tuesday 's statement			1
" we lost the battle for term limits after the 1994 @entity95 because we forced our best advocates for reform to go home , while the big - spending career politicians waited them out			1
we must have term limits for all or term limits will never succeed			2
only when we apply the same rules to all will we be able to enact vital bipartisan reforms			0
" one of the original co-sponsors of the amendment is sen. @entity106 , @entity107 , who is serving her third term in the @entity16 , but is expected to resign her seat to focus on a gubernatorial bid			2
a spokesman for @entity106 said it is easy to square the fact that the @entity114 @entity4 is advocating a cap of two terms , even though she is currently in the middle of her third term			2
" throughout her career she has fought for term limits and continues to do so , and that is why she is co-sponsoring this bill , " said @entity106 spokesman @entity118			2
" but until it is passed , it would do a disservice to @entity114 and the people of @entity114 to do away with the seniority she has gained , unless all the states and all of the senators hold themselves to the same standard			0
" the two other original co-sponsors of the amendment are sen. @entity133 , @entity134 , and sen. @entity135 , @entity136			0
@entity133 , a first - term senator , is up for re-election to his second term in 2010 , while @entity135 is retiring next year after pledging to serve only two full terms in the @entity16			1
as congressmen , both voted in favor of the @entity4 's @entity95 term limit proposal in 1995			1
@entity133 , a longtime term - limits supporter , retired from the @entity18 in 2000 after serving three terms , based on that pledge .			1

there are no term limits for federal lawmakers
some @entity4 lawmakers want to limit terms to 12 years in the @entity16 ; 6 years in the @entity18
two - thirds of the @entity18 and @entity16 would need to approve the amendment
*similar* proposal failed 14 years ago
