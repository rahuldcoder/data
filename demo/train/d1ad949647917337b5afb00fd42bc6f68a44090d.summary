@entity3 just could n't bear to get rid of the photo of her and the young man whose heart she broke a few months after junior prom			1
she kept their prom picture in a box in a closet and rarely looked at it			1
she disliked her date 's " horrible " suit and the fact that the photographer made her look " like a china doll , " as she sat while he stood			1
still , she could n't part with the young man in that ugly suit			2
" several times over the years , i moved and packed up and ran across the picture and thought ' i ca n't get rid of it , ' " said @entity3 , 47			2
" i thought maybe i 'll see him again one day and we can share that memory			1
" corsages and tokens from prom night eventually fade , but images are indelible snapshots of the way we were , one of the few keepsakes mostly unchanged in generations			1
in an era when the average prom night costs north of $ 1,000 and dress codes complicate the perfect outfit , the power of the prom photo remains timeless			1
beyond projecting personal style , they reflect socioeconomic and cultural values from an @entity47 rite of passage , documentary photographer @entity41 said			1
" the photograph becomes an object , " said @entity48 , whose new book , " prom " is a collection of portraits from high school proms across the country			1
" the pictures are about detail and looking at the subject matter and who they are , what they 're wearing and economic status			2
" beneath the surface lie deeply personal stories of love , heartbreak and the moments before bigger steps			1
@entity70 and her fiance had other things on their minds when they attended her senior prom in march 1970 in @entity75 , @entity76			1
they were to be married in may and her husband , a high school graduate who was in the @entity79 , was set to ship out in june			2
earlier that day , they 'd been searching for an apartment			2
" we decided at the last minute to go , i do n't why , because we had been apartment - hunting all day			2
i guess because our friends were there , " said @entity85 , who shared her story on @entity88			2
" i did not have a new prom dress , so i took the same one i wore for his senior prom and put a blue velvet band on the empire waist			1
i did not want a corsage , so he gave me a single red rose			2
" when the time came for their daughter to attend prom in the 1990s , @entity85 , who will celebrate her 42nd wedding anniversary this year , could n't help but compare the differences			1
" looking at our prom photos , for us , they were just a fill - in moment , " she said			1
" my daughter had the limo , the dress , all that			0
i suppose it meant something more to her			0
" there are always people who see the prom as preparation for life 's next big event			1
@entity122 and her boyfriend went fabric shopping so his tie and pocket square would match her long , white dress			0
but then his mother grounded him " for life " for breaking curfew , preventing him from attending the @entity130 prom			1
" i was like , ' really ? my prom is in two weeks , ' " she said			1
" luckily , she had someone in mind , a junior who had struck up a conversation with her while she kept stats for the baseball team			0
she told him she had a boyfriend but they still hit it off and exchanged numbers			0
" i called him up and said i have no date			0
he pounced on that opportunity to take me , " she said			0
her boyfriend did n't see the stand - in as a threat , but little did he know that after that night , his girlfriend and her new date would be " inseparable , " said @entity151 , who shared her story on @entity88			0
she broke up with her boyfriend a week later and started dating @entity151			0
the two parted ways when she went to college , but reconnected seven years later and married soon after			0
the theme of their wedding ? a starry decor to match the theme of their prom			1
" i think that the way that @entity151 and i met and the way things transpired was kind of magical and i thought it was worth recreating , " she said			0
" everything was kinda serendipitous ... after four years of passing each other in school and nothing and then that one day sitting on the bench , and then my boyfriend getting grounded , it really just happened very magically			0
" for many couples , prom is the first major milestone in the relationship , and the image from that night is a marker of their growing dedication to one another			1
@entity180 and her boyfriend , @entity181 , attended his senior prom in 1995 at @entity183 in @entity184 ; the next year , the @entity186 reservist was wearing a uniform in the picture from her senior prom			1
she keeps the images in a cedar chest that has accompanied the family on each of their 12 moves since they married in 1997			1
the chest and all the keepsakes it contains are a testament to their devotion to each other , said @entity203 , who shared her story on @entity88			0
" it 's like a snapshot of who we were at that time in our lives , " she said			1
" the first one is when we started dating and with each one you can see how much he changed and i changed			0
and , despite all the changes in work or military moves or 9/11 , you change together and make it work			0
" for nearly 29 years , @entity3 regarded her prom picture with the boy in the homely suit as a symbol of love lost			1
no matter who @entity3 was with , and even when she was married , she always compared her partner to the person in that photo			0
" i guess i hoped that maybe one day we 'd get back together , so i never let that go , " she said			0
" i kept that part of him inside me			0
" her dream came true last year , when she reconnected with him in their hometown of @entity234 , @entity235 , 29 years after she broke up with him for someone else			1
" i said i could just be seeing an old friend or sparking up an old flame , " she said			0
" we spent eight hours talking that day and have been together ever since			0
" the pair married in january in @entity241 , @entity242 , where @entity3 lives			0
now , she 's getting ready to move back to @entity235 to be with him			2
that old photo became a symbol of what 's possible			2
" we both feel that if we had not gone through the experiences we went through , we might not have stayed together			0
we now know the mistakes we made with other people and we 're not going make them with each other			0
we 're committed to making this work for the rest of our lives , " said @entity3 , who shared her story on @entity88			0
" to end up with your prom date and know that the end of my life will be as good as the beginning is more than i could have ever dreamed of			2
