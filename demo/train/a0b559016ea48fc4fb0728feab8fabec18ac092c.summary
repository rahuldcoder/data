@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 man who had been condemned by a court in @entity7 to die last week for " sorcery " has not been executed , his lawyer said monday			1

she added that she had heard saturday from sources in @entity7 with knowledge of the case that the beheading had not been carried out friday , as originally planned			2
also saturday , she said , she sent an official letter to @entity7 's @entity18 asking him to pardon her client			1
she said she would send more letters of appeal tuesday to @entity1 government officials asking them to intervene			2
@entity7 government officials would not comment to @entity2 about the case			2
justice minister @entity11 said last week that he had urged the @entity7 government not to carry out the execution , and @entity12 's wife made an emotional plea for mercy from the kingdom 's rulers during a @entity2 interview thursday			1
" all i ask is for the @entity7 king and the @entity7 government to show him mercy -- let him come back to his country and his family , " @entity33 said			2
@entity12 used to offer predictions and advice to callers on a @entity1 television network			1
he was arrested by @entity7 's religious police and charged with sorcery while visiting the country in may 2008 while on an @entity46 pilgrimage , @entity9 said			1
@entity7 authorities have not disclosed details of the charge for which @entity12 has been condemned			1
" we ca n't understand how they could arrest him and charge him and sentence him to death , " @entity33 said			0
" it does n't make any sense			0
" @entity9 said wednesday that she had been told about the upcoming execution by a @entity7 source with knowledge of the case and the proceedings			0
@entity1 's government said it had no confirmation that his execution had been set , but @entity11 called the sentence " disproportionate			1
" " i have asked them not to implement any execution in this case , " he said			0
" as far as i know , such an act does n't deserve such a punishment , unless there is something else -- something that i have not had the possibility to study or to examine myself			0
" @entity33 said the family has been unable to contact @entity12 " for a long time " and has received no official notification that her husband 's execution date has been set			2
" we do n't understand how he could be executed without us getting any notification first , " @entity33 said			0
" how could they decide to execute him and not inform us ? " a law against witchcraft remains on the books in @entity1 , but is the equivalent of a misdemeanor , @entity11 said			0
" i respect the law of @entity7 , which is based on @entity89 law , " he said			0
" but at the same time , i 'm very concerned about such a sentence			0
" @entity12 was convicted by a court in @entity92 and sentenced to death in november , @entity9 said			2

but the judges in @entity92 upheld their original verdict in march , she said			0
the human rights group @entity100 has called for @entity12 's release			1
his case drew a small knot of protesters from a @entity1 youth group to the @entity105 in @entity0 on thursday , and @entity11 said he told his @entity7 counterpart that beheading @entity12 " would not be productive " to @entity1 - @entity7 relations			1
" i have done what i thought was responsible for the justice minister in @entity1 to do , and i said to my colleague in @entity7 that such an act in @entity1 would not be sanctioned by more than two months of imprisonment , " @entity11 said			1
