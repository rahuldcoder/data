@entity0 -- former @entity3 sen. @entity2 knows a thing or two about passing landmark immigration reform			1
my friend and former graduate school professor did it in 1986 with the @entity10 , which he co-authored with former rep. @entity11			0
@entity12 knows that the endeavor is not for the faint of heart , or the thin - skinned or the easily disillusioned			1
it means navigating one of the wackiest and wickedest debates in our public discourse			0
the immigration debate , he likes to say , is filled with " emotion , fear , guilt and racism			2
" it is no wonder that most lawmakers wo n't go anywhere near the immigration issue			1
for those who grab the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground , things can get frustrating			2
@entity37 began the education of @entity39			1
the @entity41 senator is the de-facto leader of the @entity42 , the bipartisan group of senators pushing for immigration reform			1
@entity39 has become the face of immigration reform			1
he is the most articulate advocate and the game 's most valuable player in large part because he is charged with rounding up @entity50 votes			1
meanwhile , if @entity39 were to withdraw support for the bill , it would n't just be a game changer			1
it would be game over			0
he recently worried allies by characterizing the bill as not strong enough and said that more border security measures have to be added			0
while @entity39 courts @entity50 , the @entity62 members of the gang ( @entity64 of @entity65 , @entity66 of @entity67 or @entity68 of @entity69 ) need to arm - twist @entity62 to make sure they 're on board			1
many of the @entity73 's @entity62 do n't seem enthusiastic about a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants			2
on my scorecard , i count at least 10 @entity62 , from both red states and union - friendly rust belt states , who either outright oppose the legislation or whose support is shaky			1
@entity64 predicted sunday on @entity86 's " @entity85 " that a bill could pass by the @entity88 and that he is shooting for 70 votes , which he thought he could get , including a majority of @entity50			1
i 've followed @entity64 's approach to the immigration issue for many years , and most of what he says on the subject is a falsehood , a fraud or a fairy tale			2
a couple of weeks ago , @entity68 went on @entity102 's sunday show , " @entity103 , " and candidly told host @entity104 that the @entity42 did n't have 60 votes			0
and now suddenly they have 70 ? this is @entity64 's game : set expectations high and put the burden of meeting them squarely on @entity50			1
leave @entity62 off the hook			0
talk about how most republicans will support the bill			0
so when the vote comes and it turns out -- surprise ! -- a majority of @entity50 vote against the thing , the @entity50 will catch all the blame			2
it 's all part of mr. @entity39 's wild ride			2
here you have a rising star in the @entity50 tasked with the thankless job of ginning up support among @entity50 for a bill that many of them think would create millions of new @entity62 voters , albeit , 13 years down the road , which is the amount of time that the legislation requires illegal immigrants to wait before becoming citizens and getting the right to vote			1
i ca n't decide which is more pathetic			1
that @entity50 have such a guilty conscience -- for the hamhanded way in which they 've handled immigration , and the acrimony they 've stirred up against @entity141 -- that they think legalized immigrants are going to hold a grudge for 13 years before finally getting even			1
or that @entity50 have so little confidence in their own party , message and ability to win over these voters in those same 13 years by coming up with policies that appeal to them			1
from the sounds of the debate , @entity39 is n't making as many converts as he is making enemies in his own party			1
there are even some conservatives , in the conspiracy corner of the @entity50 , who suggest that this was the secret plan of @entity62 all along : rope @entity39 into supporting immigration reform			1
put him front and center			0
ruin his reputation with conservatives			0
and effectively remove him from the top - tier of 2016 @entity50 presidential hopefuls			1
that is a little far - fetched			0
besides , @entity39 could emerge from all this with enough new supporters on the left to make up for whatever support he could be losing on the right			1
either way , he seems intent on fighting one battle at a time and , assuming he has @entity178 ambitions , letting the next presidential race take care of itself			0
as for the senator wavering on the immigration bill , i do n't see it			2
@entity39 supports the main principles , and he 's simply thinking about the best way to pass it			2
he said during a television interview on tuesday that he does n't think the bill has the 60 votes needed to break a possible filibuster and that " even the @entity62 would concede that			0
" and he is worried that " horse trading " could water down the border security provisions			0
but he still backs the final product			0
in an interview with @entity199 a few months ago , @entity39 , whose middle name is @entity197 , said that his mother , @entity200 , left him a voice mail in december			2
she urged him to do right by illegal immigrants , whom she called " @entity203 " ( the poor ones )			0
the message went : " @entity206 , some loving advice from the person who cares for you most in the world			0
do n't mess with the immigrants , my son			0
please , do n't mess with them			0
they 're human beings just like us , and they came for the same reasons we came			0
so please , do n't mess with them			0
" @entity39 has said that his mother 's plea reminded him that immigration has a " human element			1
" now everything i see and hear , including the senator appearing on a gauntlet of conservative radio shows to defend the bill , tells me that @entity39 will keep the faith			2
that 's not easy to do when , i have it on good authority , your @entity73 office is getting hate mail comically telling the @entity241 - @entity240 lawmaker to " go back to @entity242 ! " normally , that sort of thing might seem strange			0
but in the immigration debate , it 's madness as usual			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			2

@entity249 : immigration reform is not for the faint of heart or the thin - skinned
@entity249 : @entity39 has the thankless job of ginning up support among @entity50
he says most lawmakers prefer not to go near it ; for those who do , it can be frustrating
@entity249 : why ca n't the @entity50 be confident and come up with policies that appeal to them ?
