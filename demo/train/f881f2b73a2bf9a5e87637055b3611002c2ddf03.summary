@entity0 , the high school chemistry teacher turned meth dealer in the fictional tv series " @entity3 , " would seem to have little in common with the real - life president @entity4 , who played a celebrated part in the passage of the @entity7 50 years ago			1
yet @entity8 , who played @entity0 and now stars as @entity4 in a @entity10 play , sees a common thread : " they 're both very powerful , strong - willed , smart and damaged			1
in both cases , ego had a large part of what downfall they had , " @entity8 said when i questioned him in a recent panel discussion			1
last week , i had the pleasure of taking a group of 50 @entity23 students to the new @entity10 play " all the way , " starring @entity8 as @entity4			1
written by the @entity27 - winning @entity26 , the play is a riveting portrait of one of the most important and controversial presidents in @entity32 history			1
besides great entertainment , " @entity42 " also offers an excellent opportunity to think about some of the lessons we need to include in our civic education to younger @entity32 , some of the aspects of politics that often elude the textbooks			1
among those lessons : insider politics can be good : the era of insider politics had its virtues			1
in @entity4 's time , politicians came to @entity50 for most of their career , spending their adult lives in the city and displaying a true passion for the political process			1
this is difficult to understand in the @entity58 landscape , when most elected officials spend their time railing against @entity50 , trying as hard as possible to have as little do with @entity61 as possible			0
while many put down former president @entity64 , most politicians still try to replicate the anti-politics campaign style that he perfected in 1976 , where his major selling point was not being part of @entity50 's broken system			2
as a result of fundraising and cheap air travel , more politicians spend their time outside of the district or inside the halls of events filled with wealthy donors from whom they 're trying to raise another buck			0
distrust in government is healthy and skepticism about @entity50 is well - deserved , but there was also something important about an era like the 1950s and 1960s when our nation 's leaders lived and breathed the institutions of government			1
in a long career in @entity50 , @entity4 developed close relationships with other members of @entity95 and gained an intimate knowledge of all the issues , the history , and the arcane procedures that gave character to the city			1
his longstanding relationship with @entity105 sen. @entity104 , with whom he had worked closely throughout the 1950s when @entity4 was @entity108 majority leader , enabled negotiations over civil rights to move forward			1
politics and policy are connected : too often these days , politics is a dirty word			2
television shows like " scandal , " " homeland " and " @entity118 " all present politics as a power game replete with maneuvering and manipulation			0
( sometimes life actually imitates art. last week the @entity125 took a " @entity118 " - style vote			0
when a bill looked like it was going to face defeat , the @entity123 pulled the bill from the floor and members went back to their offices , waiting to hear what would come next			0
while they waited , leaders from both parties sneakily brought the bill back to the floor for a quick vote			0
the bill passed as most members sat in their office having no idea what was taking place			0
) but " @entity42 " is a powerful reminder that politicians often use their ambition and ruthless drive for power productively			0
it might make you " squeamish , " @entity8 tells the audience in the final scene of the play , but this is how new policies are born			2
@entity4 is as manipulative as any character in " @entity118 , " obsessing over power and willing to twist arms as far as they could go without breaking			2
but @entity162 captures something essential about @entity4 and his allies on @entity61 : namely , that often power - craving politicians use that ambition toward higher ends			2
the process is ugly , confusing , and messy			0
but in this case the product is something magnificent			0
the @entity7 was a " big f - ing deal , " in the words that our current vice president , @entity172 , used to describe president @entity175 's health care reform			1
when all was said and done , the @entity7 ended the system of racial segregation that had defined public life in the @entity180 since the end of @entity182			2
politics is about compromise : in today 's political environment , compromise is a dirty word			1
we do n't value leaders who adjust their positions in the pursuit of cutting deals , dismissing them as flip - floppers and sellouts			0
" @entity42 " is about the necessity of compromise to keep things moving			0
@entity4 , as well as the rev. @entity198 agree to huge compromises that anger their supporters -- including civil rights leaders and vice president @entity203 -- by , for example , agreeing to exclude voting rights from the legislation			2
at one point , @entity210 's @entity4 explains , " this is not about principle			1
it 's about votes ! " the costs of presidential hubris : although the play focuses on the @entity7 and election of 1964 , the seeds of @entity4 's destruction are planted in the early discussions of @entity220 surrounding the @entity221 in august 1964 , when @entity4 's political fears of a right - wing backlash ( against a president who might be depicted as refusing to stand firm against communism ) led him deeper into the mire of @entity220			1
even as @entity203 warns @entity4 against getting deeply involved in the faraway conflict , @entity4 , at the height of his influence , is confident that he will be able to contain it			2
this is one of the lessons of presidential history that is too often forgotten			0
we see again and again , especially in the realm of foreign policy , how presidents from both parties can go too far , believing they know best and insisting they can avoid the mistakes of their predecessors			0
their decisions ultimately damage their legacy and the nation			0
sometimes popular culture does n't have much to offer for the real world			0
but " @entity42 " is a great history lesson for voters and politicians who are concerned about the quality of @entity32 's civic life .			1

@entity8 sees the destructive role of ego in stories of @entity4 and fictional @entity0
@entity257 says the actor 's portrayal reveals important lessons about politics
compromise is what politics is all about , and there 's value to political insiders , he says
@entity257 : @entity7 's passage showed potential for politics to *improve* @entity32
