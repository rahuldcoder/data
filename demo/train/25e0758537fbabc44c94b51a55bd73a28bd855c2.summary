-- @entity2 's top human rights official said the @entity4 regime is reviewing a sentence of execution by stoning for a woman convicted of adultery			1
" sentences such as stoning will be closely reviewed and probably changed , " @entity9 told @entity2 's @entity10			1
@entity9 was referring to the well - publicized case of @entity14 , who faces the possibility of execution after being convicted in 2006 of adultery			1
her lawyer , @entity18 , told @entity0 that @entity14 confessed to the crime after being subjected to 99 lashes			0
she later recanted that confession and has denied wrongdoing , he said			0
her conviction was based not on evidence but on the determination of three out of five judges , he added			0
she has asked forgiveness from the court but the judges refused to grant clemency			0
@entity2 's supreme court upheld the conviction in 2007			1
@entity14 's case has drawn international attention and many human rights activists have called for the sentence to be changed			0
in @entity40 , @entity39 on saturday , protesters waved flags and chanted anti-government slogans to the beat of a drum in front of the @entity46			0
they condemned executions in @entity2 -- by hanging and stoning			1
" stop the hanging in @entity2 -- now , now , now			1
stop the stoning in @entity2 -- now , now , now			1
" but @entity9 said protests from outside @entity2 will not affect @entity14 's case			1
" the @entity53 attacks have no effect on the opinion of our judges , " he told the news agency			0
@entity9 's comments seemed to contradict @entity2 's first public statement on the case made thursday by the @entity2 embassy in @entity40 , @entity39 , which suggested @entity14 would not be stoned			1
it said " this mission denies the false news aired in this respect and ... according to information from the relevant judicial authorities in @entity2 , she will not be executed by stoning punishment			2
" it is notable that this kind of punishment has rarely been implemented in @entity2 and various means and remedies must be probed and exhausted to finally come up with such a punishment , " the embassy said			2
@entity14 's son , who appealed wednesday to @entity2 's courts to spare his mother 's life , said he wo n't accept any decision short of his mother 's freedom			1
through human rights activist @entity84 , @entity83 said she would be satisfied only when @entity2 's judiciary officially drops the charges against her			2
@entity84 has told @entity0 that only an international campaign designed to pressure the @entity4 regime in @entity89 could save @entity91 's life			2
" legally , it 's all over , " said @entity84 , who heads the @entity92 and the @entity93 , earlier this week			0
@entity14 's son wrote in an open letter to government officials that there was neither evidence nor legal grounds for his mother 's conviction and sentence			0
he said the family has traveled six times from their home in @entity106 to @entity89 to speak with @entity2 officials , but in vain			2
" so i have no option but reaching out to them this way , " he said earlier in the week			0
why , he asked , has an accused been twice prosecuted on the same charge when @entity4 criminal law allows prosecution only once ? @entity115 told @entity0 that he visits his mother every monday in jail , never knowing whether that meeting will be their last .			0
