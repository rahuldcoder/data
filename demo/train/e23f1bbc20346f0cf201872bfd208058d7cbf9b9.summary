@entity0 -- a " grand " moment for the @entity3 , a spotlight on @entity5 , more muted @entity7 expectations about @entity8 , and stretch - run @entity10 calculations filled our weekly trip around the " @entity14 " table			1
two events , one contrast : @entity17 @entity18 and @entity5 are featured in high - profile events happening at the same time monday -- both in @entity21			2
@entity22 of the @entity23 reminds us it is a great opportunity for those who like to compare and contrast the agendas and approaches of the @entity30 's leading women			2
" obviously , a lot of people on the left would like to see @entity5 run , " says @entity22			2
" but she 's been out there on the trail doing a lot more for @entity30 candidates so far than @entity18 , who 's been really focused on her own agenda , " @entity22 adds			2
" so it will be interesting to watch that contrast and whether @entity18 , who will be doing more @entity30 events , ( is ) building up a little resentment there by not getting out on the trail			1
" the @entity47 event is part of the @entity50 's focus on women and girls			1
sen. @entity53 is headlining a big @entity55 fund - raiser			0
if for @entity57 's event does n't happen ... yes , there is work for the @entity50			0
and events to help @entity30 gin up women 's turnout in the midterms			0
but the most important upcoming event in @entity66 is the arrival of daughter @entity69 's baby -- the first grandchild for @entity71 and @entity18			0
and @entity73 's @entity72 tells us the " baby watch " is both a personal and political turning point for the likely 2016 @entity30 front - runner			1
" the @entity3 have not said when ( their ) daughter , @entity69 , is due with ( their ) first grandchild ... but it is believed to be within the next few weeks , " says @entity72			0
" @entity18 has said this is the thing that will impact , to some extent , anyway , her thinking about running for president , and so we are now entering that window			0
she says she 's going to see what being a grandmother feels like			0
a @entity90 on @entity89 in @entity91 the @entity93 @entity92 , a big player in this year 's @entity96 spending , is making a big bet on @entity89 and the @entity99 race			1
fresh from a new research effort in the @entity91 , the @entity92 is convinced that the race , a dead heat entering the final six weeks , can be swayed by aggressively linking incumbent @entity30 sen. @entity103 to president @entity104			1
watch for a tough new ad this week making the case that she has supported the president more than 90 % of the time			2
the latest @entity1 poll put the president 's approval rating in @entity91 at 35 %			0
looking to make a splash , the @entity92 is buying time in the more expensive @entity115 tv market in addition to @entity91 outlets			1
a lame - @entity118 ? @entity119 is gone until after the midterm vote , and @entity10 leaders are breathing sighs of relief because there were no last - minute surprises that might have hurt the party 's election efforts			2
well , @entity128 of the @entity129 reports , that 's no accident			0
but his conversations with key tea party leaders suggest there might well be some fireworks in the so - called " lame duck " session scheduled for after the election			2
" they 're already planning to fight the president if he moves forward on executive action on immigration , " explains @entity128			0
" in fact , ( @entity10 congressman ) @entity142 ( from @entity143 ) told me that he 's prepared to tie government funding in december to blocking any potential executive action			0
so we could have another showdown on the horizon if that happens			0
@entity93 and @entity8 leaders at @entity152 , but low expectations it almost happened last year : a meeting between the leaders of the @entity93 and @entity8			1
and you could argue there is more urgency this year , given the potential for @entity8 to shape the fight against @entity162			1
but @entity163 of @entity164 reports that the @entity104 @entity7 is going to great lengths to note grievances with @entity8 as it lowers expectations for any dramatic diplomatic moment as both president @entity104 and @entity8 president @entity169 attend @entity152 events this week			1
" nuclear talks with @entity8 are deadlocked , there 's a lot of tension over whether the @entity93 and @entity8 will work together to fight the @entity175 , and most importantly , @entity7 officials are absolutely furious with @entity8 for detaining a @entity129 reporter and his wife , " says @entity163			1
" and the takeaway for the @entity7 has been that while @entity169 and his colleagues may talk more moderately than some of their predecessors , a lot of the actions have n't changed and there 's not a sense that having a meeting would be productive at this point			0
" @entity47 's fall to - do list			1

@entity93 and @entity8 leaders to meet at @entity194 ? @entity195 will tell
@entity47 *grandbaby* watch 2014
