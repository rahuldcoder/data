@entity0 , @entity1 -- the stepmother of a missing 10 - year - old girl in @entity1 said during a jailhouse visit with two relatives this week that she blames a lot of her current predicament on her husband , one of those relatives said friday			2
the relative , one of two cousins who visited monday with @entity13 in jail , said she was speaking publicly after a few family members met and " decided that we needed to share a few things that we do know			1
" @entity13 's stepdaughter , @entity18 , was reported missing last month			1
" as we talked with her , she cried over missing @entity24 and how her husband has left her to take all the blame for what has happened when he played a big part in this terrible situation , " the cousin said in an exclusive interview with @entity22 's " @entity23 " producer @entity21			1
the cousin spoke on condition of anonymity because of death threats the family has received			2
later , the cousin said @entity13 believed it was unfair that she was jailed " for something that he had done , " referring to husband @entity38 , @entity24 's father			1
the cousin said she hoped that @entity24 's body will be found soon , " since she is believed to be deceased and that all of the truth will come out			2
" the cousin said she and her sister visited @entity13 in jail on monday after more than two years during which they had not spoken			1
the woman added that she had received three letters from @entity13 , " and in each one of them she made it very clear how much she cared about @entity24 and that she do n't understand the man that she loves can be this , can do her this way			1
" the woman said she did not know what happened to the freckle - faced girl who lost her leg to bone cancer at age 5 and reportedly developed lung cancer a few years later			0
police launched a search for @entity24 on october 9 , but no one other than a family member had reported seeing her since september 25 , when a woman saw her at a furniture store			0
police on monday confirmed that a prosthetic leg discovered last week in brush off a @entity1 road belongs to @entity18 , whose disappearance is now being probed as a homicide			0
police said @entity13 admitted that she planted a fake ransom note the day after the girl 's disappearance was reported			1
initially arrested on october 10 on charges unrelated to @entity24 's disappearance , including writing worthless checks , @entity13 was additionally charged with obstruction of justice for leaving the note			1
that charge is a felony			0
she is now cooperating with investigators , @entity0 police have said			0
@entity24 's father was arrested late last month in nearby @entity91 on eight charges , including five counts of submitting worthless checks and three counts of failing to appear in court			0
police earlier acknowledged that @entity97 faced bad - check charges unrelated to the disappearance of his daughter			2
but they did not initially arrest him , as he had been helping authorities in their search			0
" @entity97 has a lot of the answers , " @entity13 's cousin said friday			1
" what we do know about him is that he does n't believe in @entity109			0
he is very into paganism			0
he 's ridin ' around with a sign on his window that says @entity24 was abused by her stepmother			0
if this is true , then why did n't he , the biological father , put a stop to it and protect his little girl ? " why did n't he beg the public for someone to bring his daughter home ? why has he not personally searched for @entity24 ? how could a loving father begin his 911 call with , ' hello , how are you doing ? ' he needs to answer these questions			0
" @entity97 's attorney has not returned repeated phone calls from @entity2 requesting comment on the investigation			1
during their discussion , the woman said her cousin told her that @entity24 's cancer had been in remission , but that she was sick for the two weeks " before whatever 's happened happened ... she did not completely come out and tell me what has actually happened			1
" the woman said that @entity13 " cared for that little girl deeply " and had taken a polygraph			2
@entity141 , @entity13 's attorney , declined to comment friday when asked about the polygraph			1
asked why none of @entity13 's relatives had bailed her out of jail , the woman said , " i guess probably they 're waiting for evidence or to find out what has really happened			1
" asked if the family is divided about what may have happened , she said , " a little bit right now , yes			2
" asked what she thinks happened to the girl , the woman said , " i absolutely have no clue			0
all of it is just so confusing and , until we get the facts , i 'm not going to know what to think			0
