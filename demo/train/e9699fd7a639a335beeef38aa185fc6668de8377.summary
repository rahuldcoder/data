-- relations between the @entity2 and @entity3 , already strained by @entity2 sanctions on @entity3 's central bank and @entity3 naval exercises in the @entity7 , are on the verge of spinning out of control			1
what can push the two nations into a military confrontation is the fate of a @entity14 , @entity15			1
a @entity16 in western @entity3 sentenced the dual @entity2 - @entity3 citizen to death on january 9 , claiming that he is a @entity19 spy			1
it is not often that the fate of entire nations hinges on that of a single individual , but the execution of a marine by @entity3 will almost certainly inflame public opinion and tilt the balance toward war			1
but perhaps what will save the day is an incident that placed friendship and trust , rather than enmity and paranoia , between @entity3 and @entity2			1
days before the death sentence was passed on the @entity14 , @entity2 sailors rescued 13 @entity3 fishermen held hostage for several weeks by @entity41 pirates who had seized their fishing vessel off the coast of @entity44			1
those @entity41 pirates may have pulled off a diplomatic stunt that has eluded @entity2 and @entity3 politicians for more than three decades			1
for a brief moment , the pirates healed the wounds of history			0
two nations split since the hostage crisis of 1979 found their fishermen and sailors forced into each other 's arms by a turn of fate			2
it was a most embarrassing embrace , with both governments trying to figure out how to handle the threat of friendship			0
even the pretense of hostility came down			0
it fell upon one of the rescued fisherman , @entity65 , to revel in the twists and turns of fortune			0
as devout seamen are wont to do , he interpreted his miraculous rescue by the @entity2 as an act of @entity73			1
" it 's like you were sent by @entity73 , " he told the @entity2 sailors			1
" every night we prayed for @entity73 to save us			2
and now you are here			0
" like @entity76 , @entity65 and his shipmates vanished in time			0
but then they found themselves returned to an @entity3 port			2
they will no doubt relate their encounter , not with predator drones but a giant and gentle @entity2 whale			0
one can already hear the peels of laughter and shrieks of disbelief as @entity65 tells the story of how they were disgorged out of the belly of the @entity41 shark because the @entity2 whale spoke @entity95			0
it may be that our fate is determined by crusty histories and fixed ideologies			0
but given the gulf separating @entity3 and @entity2 , this metaphor is worth reflecting upon			2
the rescue of the fishermen also evokes memories of a distant past and dreams of a hopeful future			0
while the @entity110 's ideologues portray @entity2 as a belligerent and hostile power , most @entity3 recognize that if it were not for @entity2 's defense of @entity3 's sovereignty in 1946 , @entity112 would have devoured northern @entity3			2
many ordinary people in @entity3 , far from seeking a war with the @entity2 ( or @entity118 ) , silently pray to @entity73 for an end to their hardships			1
they dream of an @entity3 @entity121			1
sadly , in the modern @entity123 , divine interventions -- @entity73 's creativity and compassion -- have taken on an ugly tone			0
if @entity73 favors this tribe or that faith , then must it mean that other faiths and tribes are to be destroyed ? the acts of @entity73 -- earthquakes , floods , plagues , famine and such -- veer from the minor to the massive			0
add nuclear weapons to @entity73 's arsenal and there is very little room left for tiny fishermen and their benevolent @entity73			2
but what if the fisherman @entity65 was right ? with a @entity14 's life and so much else at stake , what if the whole rescue incident was an act of @entity73 , his way of shaming world leaders by showing how even the most clueless of pirates can turn sworn enemies into friends , however temporarily ? for helping the hapless @entity3 and the @entity2 find common ground , even if it 's at sea , the pirates deserve a toot , a hoot and quite possibly a salute			1
whether the future of @entity2 - @entity3 relations will be stormy or turn hopeful , only @entity73 knows			1
centuries before , @entity161 , the greatest of @entity163 poets , may have captured the essence of the fishermen rescue incident in describing what it means to offer friendship and show humanity			1
his wisdom can perhaps draw @entity3 and @entity2 together : " @entity172 for it brings @entity174			2
uproot the @entity175 of @entity176 for it summons @entity178			0
" follow @entity179 on @entity180 join the conversation on @entity182 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity15 .			0

@entity15 : the fate of a @entity14 can push the @entity2 and @entity3 into a military *conflict*
he says that the incident of @entity2 sailors rescuing @entity3 fishermen is a diplomatic feat
@entity15 : what if the whole rescue incident was an act of @entity73 ?
he says many in @entity3 dream of an @entity3 @entity121 , they do not want war with the @entity2 ( or @entity118 )
