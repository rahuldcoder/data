-- for the past five years now , we here at the international women 's movement @entity2 have been waging an active campaign of resistance to the patriarchy in various corners of the world			1
we have been bringing the world the simple idea of women 's liberation by means of sexual emancipation as expressed in highly visible acts of political protest			2
we believe that the enslavement of women began with the enslavement of their sexuality , so we therefore consider it legitimate to use their liberated sexuality as a symbol of women 's worldwide liberation			1
we divide the patriarchy confronting us into three basic parts			2
@entity29 , dictatorship , as a tool for enslaving women			1
for this reason we are a democratic movement			2
the second part of the system consists of religion and the church , which have overseen the spiritual enslavement of women			1
for this reason @entity2 is an atheistic group motivated by secularism and humanism			1
read more : sexualized @entity2 protest ' naive and foolish at best ' the third element of the patriarchy is the sex industry , which has been responsible for women 's sexual servitude and is in fact the most ancient form of female slavery			1
for this reason , then , @entity2 sees sexuality as the organon and canon of women 's freedom			1
hence , our three basic postulates are democracy , atheism , and sexuality			0
from what we have related above , naturally the most hated institutions are those that stand for one of these three things or a mixture of them			0
the most obvious illustration of the patriarchy is @entity71 theocracy , a symbiosis of political and religious dictatorship			1
in theocratic states , the position of women is horrifying and hopeless			2
we direct our fiercest criticism to such countries , and work in that part of the world is what most occupies our minds			0
a clear example of the " @entity84 " under way in the @entity86 and @entity87 is what our activist @entity88 has gone through			0
for having published in @entity91 topless pictures of herself with " @entity93 " written on her body , @entity88 suffered severe criticism and death threats , and was kidnapped , beaten , and subjected to humiliating treatment			0

there , shut up inside a house , she underwent a forced " islamization : " they made her read the @entity109 and took her every day to see an imam			0
@entity88 's family also declared her insane and compelled her to ingest large doses of medication			0
" because i was taking so many pills , i was sleeping all the time , " @entity88 told me			0
" and once i woke up , i understood that i did n't remember anything			0
" @entity88 finally managed to escape			0
a few hours after @entity2 activists attacked the president of @entity121 shouting " where is @entity88 ? " i received a phone call : " @entity125 , this is @entity88 speaking ! i 've escaped from my family ! " after a long conversation about what she had gone through during her period of forced isolation , i asked her whether she thought it best for her safety to leave @entity121 for a while			1
@entity88 answered that she would not leave @entity121 until she had carried out a topless protest with other @entity121 girls who had already established contact with her			0
our understanding of @entity140 , according to what we have learned fighting against it , tells us that our criticism of it is valid and holds out much hope for the future			0
at the heart of @entity140 lies the enslavement of women based on control over their sexuality			1
the hijab is at the same time both a symbol and a tool of this enslavement			1
a mass sexual protest inspired by our example will serve as the first step toward women 's recovering their own nature and will be a turning point , sparking the dissolution of the @entity164 and the return , to women , of control over the conditions of her existence , from the sexual to the political			2
i hereby both promise and threaten to deploy an entire network of @entity2 activists in @entity175 countries			1
we will hound @entity71 leaders across the globe , subjecting them to desolating criticism			0
we intend to hound spiritual leaders who are personally responsible for mistreating women			1
a million @entity181 will arise ! and freedom , at last , will dawn ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2
