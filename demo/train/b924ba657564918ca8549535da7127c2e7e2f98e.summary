@entity0 -- the @entity2 remained tightlipped friday as criticism mounted over the decision to hold the the september 11 terrorist attack trial in a civilian court in lower @entity7			1
earlier , senior @entity9 administration officials confirmed that the @entity10 is considering moving the site of the trial if the @entity2 sees fit			1
" conversations have occurred within the administration to discuss contingency options should the possibility of a trial in lower @entity7 be foreclosed upon by @entity19 or locally , " a senior administration official said			1
@entity2 officials refused to acknowledge whether they are being pressed to find an alternative location , despite bipartisan concern that holding the trial in @entity7 would be too costly and disruptive			1
" we 're reviewing our options , " said @entity2 spokesman @entity24 in a statement friday			2
the administration 's turnabout comes after @entity30 mayor @entity29 and other politicians expressed great concern over the costs and disruption of holding the trial of @entity36 and four accomplices at a courthouse near @entity39 in lower @entity7			1
@entity10 officials said president @entity9 agrees with attorney general @entity42 's decision in november to try the suspects in a civilian criminal court in the @entity45 , not a military tribunal			1
" currently our federal jails hold hundreds of convicted terrorists , and the president 's opinion has not changed on that , " @entity10 spokesman @entity47 said thursday			2
@entity10 officials say the decision about any possible alternate sites to try @entity36 and the others will come from the @entity2			1
one government official close to the case said other @entity30 locations , including a military site on @entity61 's @entity60 , are possibilities			2
and while @entity64 sites also were mentioned as alternatives by former counterterrorism officials , @entity64 sen. @entity63 , a @entity65 , opposed moving the trial to his state			1
" bringing enemy combatants for detention or trial in @entity0 , or @entity64 would unnecessarily burden these communities from both a financial and security perspective , " @entity63 said			0
@entity30 police estimated the cost to the city would be over $ 200 million per year in what could be a multi-year trial and that over 2,000 checkpoints would need to be installed around @entity7			1
police commissioner @entity83 said additional protection would have to be deployed for the city , not just the core area of @entity7			2
residents like @entity88 contemplated what it will be like to live through the trial			0
" those people would virtually be held prisoner in their homes , " @entity88 said of @entity30 who live near the courthouse			2
" we 've all been traumatized , any of us who were there that day " referring to september 11			0
@entity29 initially supported the move , saying " it is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the @entity39 where so many @entity30 were murdered			1
" but this week he used different rhetoric when asked about a community agency 's proposal 's to relocate the trial , saying he would prefer the trial be held elsewhere , perhaps at a military base where it would be easier and cheaper to provide security			0
" it 's going to cost an awful lot of money and disturb a lot of people , " @entity29 said			0
on thursday , a group of @entity30 politicians urged the @entity9 administration to thoroughly re-examine locating the trials in downtown @entity7			1
" we are concerned that the administration has not fully considered the impact that the trials would have on lower @entity7 in choosing the @entity124 in @entity125 , " @entity45 reps			2
@entity126 and @entity127 , both democrats , and several state and local officials said in a letter dated thursday to @entity42			0
also , a spokeswoman for gov. @entity133 cited his " hesitation " with the decision , citing the burdens it would pose on city residents			0
a spokesman for @entity45 sen. @entity140 raised financial concerns , saying her " single biggest concern is making sure that the federal government cover the hundreds of millions of dollars per year cost to @entity30 for security during the trials			0
" @entity147 , chairwoman of a city community advisory agency , proposed four alternative locations for the trial within the @entity151 of @entity7 : @entity60 , @entity152 in @entity153 , the @entity154 at @entity154 , and the @entity156 jail complex at @entity157			2
a @entity154 spokesman said no one has officially requested a review of demands for such a trial , which would require in - depth study of legal and security concerns			0
some @entity45 senators -- including @entity167 chairman @entity166 , i - @entity169 -- want the detainees tried in military commissions			0
a letter from one group of senators said a federal civilian trial would provide militants with " one of the most visible platforms in the world to exalt their past acts and to rally others in support of further terrorism			0
" one congressman , @entity45 rep. @entity184 , @entity185 , is planning to introduce legislation that would cut off funding for the trial and block transfer of the september 11 suspects to @entity30			1
@entity193 spokesman @entity24 said the @entity2 " can safely prosecute this case in the @entity195 while minimizing disruptions to the community to the greatest extent possible , consistent with security needs			0
" president @entity9 is " committed to seeing " @entity36 , the mastermind of the attacks " brought to justice , " @entity47 said			1
" @entity36 is a murderous thug who has admitted to crimes ... some of the most heinous crimes ever committed against our country , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0
