-- i have a confession : i love @entity3			1
and yes , i know the ride - sharing app has been under fire from critics for a host of reasons lately , most of them completely valid			1
this week , in just the latest high - profile incident , an @entity3 driver in @entity12 , @entity13 , was accused of raping a passenger who used the app to call a ride			1
in other instances , the $ 40 billion " start - up " has been accused of considering smear campaigns against its journalist critics , shaming women who accuse its drivers of sexism or assault , launching a blatantly sexist ad campaign that was reported to involve 20 - minute free rides with attractive women in @entity29 , and , according to a @entity0 report , ordering thousands of rides from its competitor , @entity34 , and then canceling them , in apparent attempt to hurt @entity34 's business			1
but , confession : on sunday , i took @entity3 to the airport in @entity41			1
when i arrived in @entity42 , i cursed the line of yellow taxis			2
@entity3 is faster , friendlier and cleaner			1
above all : it 's more convenient			2
and that , i 've realized , is what drives morality in the digital age : convenience			1
if it 's convenient to look past a company 's questionable ethics , to avoid clicking those bad - story links in our @entity55 feeds , then we do it			2
because it 's easy , and because publicly shaming companies , much less boycotting them , seems self - righteous and un-american in this age of runaway capitalism and gross inequality			1
that 's not the way it should be , but it 's happened			2
this is n't just about @entity3			1
it 's about @entity55 , @entity67 , @entity67 -- i am listening to @entity67 as i write this			2
and , yes , read about how the @entity70 music - streaming service pays musicians basically nothing -- $ 0.007 per stream , according to a @entity75 report -- for their art. i used @entity67 to find the aforementioned @entity75 article , and i wish that company did n't know everything about my digital life ( read : life ) , but its services are so freaking convenient i ca n't quit them			2
this focus on convenience -- and a lacking public discussion about the moral and economic consequences of certain technological advances or , more to the point , the companies that are making billions by pushing forward those advances -- gives the tech sector incredible power over consumers that , to me , seems unprecedented			1
meanwhile , many tech companies are providing services equivalent to those that , in another era , would have been managed or at least regulated by the government			2
@entity67 is the new library , @entity3 the bus , @entity67 the radio			1
they provide services we almost need to function in the modern world , but they have few competitors and come under little scrutiny from regulators and consumer watchdogs			2
so maybe it 's time for tech consumers ( read : me , you , everyone ) to take more responsibility for our choices			0
since i 'm clearly deficient at making these decisions for myself , i turned for advice to @entity118 , founder of the website @entity120 and a vocal @entity3 critic			1
" tech companies like to say they have to be responsible citizens or people will vote with their feet			0
but it does n't happen , " she wrote in an e-mail that was delivered to me with the help of both @entity67 and @entity129			0
" despite three weeks of horrific scandals not a single person responsible has ever been fired from the company			0
there is no reason to think that if something even worse happens , the company will change or act in any way			0
and no reason to expect the board and investors will force them to			0
because this is escalating behavior and @entity3 has n't yet found a line it ca n't cross			1
" no line it ca n't cross			0
these points are troubling , and they 're not unlike those about clothing companies that do business in @entity151 ; or hotel chains owned by anti-gay sultanates			0
but those are easier to boycott			0
we 're more dependent on tech. @entity3 should clean up its act -- improving its process for background checks worldwide ; becoming more responsive to critics ( i.e. , not targeting them ) , dropping the sexist nonsense , and helping its drivers earn more money			1
the company has apologized for many of its transgressions			0
it issued a statement calling the alleged rape in @entity13 an " abhorrent crime			0
" an executive , @entity173 , said in a statement to @entity175 that his comments about the company potentially targeting journalists were made at a private dinner but also " were wrong no matter the circumstance			0
" and it reportedly pulled its site about the sexist @entity29 ad			0
a company blog post published december 4 indicates @entity3 " will be making changes in the months ahead			1
" " done right , " the company says , " it will lead to a smarter and more humble company that sets new standards in data privacy , gives back more to the cities we serve and defines and refines our company culture effectively			0
" ensuring changes are " done right " will take public pressure			0
but what kind ? @entity118 has deleted @entity3 from her phone , both because of the statement it sends and because she fears for her safety when using the service			1
i 'm considering the same , and did download lyft this afternoon			0
but here 's a confession i know is both shameful and very 2014 @entity203 : i 'd still like a protest that 's more convenient .			0

@entity206 says @entity3 is causing a moral *quandary* for riders
