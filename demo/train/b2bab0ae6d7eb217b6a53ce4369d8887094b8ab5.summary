ignorance really is n't bliss			2
but there are times when the lack of knowledge and expertise about a subject or place can actually serve to clear the mind and lead to some clarity and honesty in the debate on even the most complex matters			2
i 'm certainly no expert on @entity15			1
i 'm not sure before this crisis that i could even name all of the countries that share its borders			0
but watching the ticktock of the debate on the issue this past week , i 'm stunned by the lack of perspective and breathlessness in the discussion			0
sadly , i 've grown accustomed to the partisanship			2
it has become a permanent fixture of our analytical and policy landscape			2
but here are several things about the recent coverage and discussion on @entity15 that even my lack of expertise wo n't allow me to accept : 1			1
we 're back in the @entity39 clearly , none of the resets have worked with @entity43 president @entity42			1
whether it was president @entity45 looking into his eyes and seeing his soul or @entity48 finding a stone - cold killer there , @entity42 is n't @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity53			1
that 's hardly a shocker			2
nor are we still in that unique period when two superpowers with contrasting ideological systems under the threat of nuclear war clashed and fought by proxy from one end of the globe to the other			0
there 's no doubt that the @entity66 and @entity43 have major differences			2
but the issue is no longer ideological			0
@entity43 capitalism is here to stay , state - controlled and monitored though it may be			0
and what ideology exists has more to do with asserting @entity43 national interests than anything @entity74 or @entity75 would have recognized			0
and in at least one respect , that 's too bad			2
at least during much of the @entity39 , from the 1970s on , there were rules , do 's and don'ts that prevented situations like @entity15			1
are you in @entity83 ? share your story with @entity85			1
we 'll continue to struggle with @entity42 , to be sure			1
but the world 's too small , the @entity88 too dependent on @entity43 , and the realities of global interdependence too deep to imagine hitting the rewind button and turning the planet into an arena of conflict and competition			2
would it make for a good video game ? yes			0
@entity42 is @entity98 in the past week , i 've heard people i admire and respect talk about @entity83 as @entity101 and @entity42 as @entity98			1
@entity102 wrote that history does n't repeat ; it rhymes			2
but those rhythmic patterns are n't evident here , either			0
when we ca n't think of intelligent parallels in analyzing nations who do things @entity66 can not abide , it seems we 're drawn irresistibly to the @entity98 trope			1
the same thing happens with @entity114			0
and while i do n't for a moment condone the vicious @entity119 - baiting and hating of the mullahcracy in @entity121 ( and the anti-semitism , too ) to bring up @entity98 not only trivializes the monstrosity of the evil and the magnitude of the crimes in his time , it imposes unrealistic challenges in ours			1
the unique challenge of @entity98 demanded that he be stopped and the @entity133 regime destroyed			1
we do n't have to like the @entity42 government in @entity43 , or supreme leader @entity135 's in @entity114 , to recognize that the magnitude of the threat is different			1
to compare them to @entity98 is to urge the @entity66 into a game that we do n't want to play and ca n't win			1
as best i can figure , @entity42 is a clever and easily riled @entity43 nationalist who presides over what remains of an empire whose time has come and gone			1
he lives in reality , not in some megalomaniacal world			0
but he is prepared to assert @entity43 's interests in spheres where it matters , and to block the @entity149 's intrusion into those areas as best he can			0
@entity43 is his " ideology			0
" and on @entity15 , history and proximity give him cards to play			1
this man is n't a fanatic			0
money , pleasure and power are too important to him			0
any leader who is willing to be photographed shirtless on a horse , like some cover of @entity163 , is n't going to shoot himself in the head or take cyanide in a bunker			0
this guy is way too hip ( @entity43 style ) and attached to the good life to be @entity98			1
and given @entity43 's own suffering at the hands of the @entity172 , saying he is just makes matters worse			0
it 's all @entity176 's fault president @entity176 was never the catastrophic incompetent or @entity178 's finger on earth that his worst critics imagined nor the redeemer , savior , or great president that his most avid acolytes wanted			1
and yet the notion that @entity176 , through weak and feckless foreign policy , was responsible for @entity42 's move into @entity15 strains credulity to the breaking point			1
this urban legend that because of @entity191 and the " red line " affair in @entity193 , @entity42 was compelled to do something in @entity15 that he would n't have done had @entity176 acted differently , is absurd			1
the administration 's foreign policy has often resembled a blend between a @entity200 movie and the @entity201			1
but on this one the charge is absurd , as is the notion that somehow @entity176 could have stopped him			1
when the @entity207 invaded @entity208 in 1956 , there was no @entity66 military response ; ditto in 1968 when the @entity207 put down @entity211 in @entity212			0
sometimes , geography really is destiny			0
@entity43 believed its vital interests in @entity15 were threatened and it had the means , will , and proximity to act on them			1
and it 's about time we faced up to it			0
bombing @entity193 would have saved @entity15 this notion that @entity176 's opponents have latched onto is , of course , unknowable			1
there are no rewind buttons in history			0
counterfactuals are prime talking and debating points because they can not be proven one way or the other			0
but to argue that launching cruise missiles at @entity193 military targets somehow would have deterred @entity42 from acting on what he perceived to be a @entity43 vital interest , or emboldened the @entity88 to stand tougher against him , really is off base			1
@entity193 and @entity15 are like apples and oranges the president 's detractors insist on putting in the same basket			1
even if @entity176 thought the @entity66 had vital interests that justified an attack on @entity193 , it is likely it would not have altered @entity42 's policy toward @entity15			1
the country perceived to be in @entity43 's zone of influence and manipulation was drifting westward			0
and @entity42 was determined to stop it			2
@entity15 can have a ' @entity252 ' ending are there good guys and bad guys in the @entity15 - @entity43 drama ? sure there are			1
we have courageous @entity15 patriots who died in the @entity260 for the dignity and freedom they believed in ; corrupt and ruthless government officials who were willing to use force against their own citizens ; @entity43 provocateurs eager to stir up trouble ; extremist @entity15 nationalists who are hardly democrats ; and a @entity43 strongman who hosted the @entity269 one week and invaded the territory of a sovereign country the next			2
i suspect that the @entity260 -- if that 's what it is -- may turn out better than its @entity275 counterpart			0
but we have to be real			0
@entity15 may be fractious and troubled for some time to come			2
below the morality play there is intense factionalism ; regional differences ; scores to settle ; @entity43 manipulation ; and a tendency to avoid the kind of compromise that would lead to real power sharing and good governance			0
but real democratization depends less on a friendly @entity66 or @entity290 hand than on the emergence of genuine leaders who are prepared to rise above factional affinities and see a vision for the country as a whole			0
it also depends on institutions that reflect popular will and some mechanism for accommodating differences peacefully without resorting to violence			0
there are no easy or happy endings here			0
and we can only make matters worse , as @entity306 suggested recently , by trying to turn the @entity15 crisis into a @entity43 vs. the @entity149 ( or worse , the @entity66 ) tug - of - war .			2

@entity310 says even those with little knowledge of @entity15 should spot the myths we 've heard
he says @entity176 's foreign policy is n't to blame for what @entity42 did in @entity83
@entity310 says this does n't represent a new @entity39 , nor is @entity42 *equivalent* to @entity98
he says the outcome may be *acceptable* eventually but do n't expect a @entity252 ending
