you ca n't escape @entity3 's phenomenon " @entity4			1
" it is the highest - grossing animated film of all time and one of @entity3 's top franchises			1
it was the most downloaded movie from @entity10 last year , and kids everywhere are still singing the movie 's anthem , " @entity14			1
" @entity16 , it 's now probably stuck in your own head right now , even if you have never seen the film			1
so why has the 2013 movie stuck around for so long for the under - 5 set ? experts say it is not just because you can find images of movie 's sisters on everything			1
@entity28 and @entity29 are on dresses , on scooters and , just in time for the @entity33 season , even on jelly beans			1
to understand the psychology behind " @entity36 , @entity1 reached out to psychologists who are sisters themselves : @entity38 is regional director for @entity39			1
@entity40 is an associate professor of clinical psychology at @entity43 , @entity43			0
here is our edited conversation			0
@entity1 : princess movies have been around since the beginning of time , but this has really resonated			1
what has made this one so unique ? @entity38 : one of the things that really struck me , and i think struck little children , is that there is a really strong intergenerational , family - themed message here			1
despite the sisters @entity29 and @entity28 being separated for so long , the story is ultimately about the bond between the two of them			0
when you 're little , that is your zone ; that 's your group ; they define your world			1
highlighting that and making it feel important -- your sister , your brother , your mom and dad -- is something little kids can really identify with			0
@entity40 : kids can really understand the idea of their sister wanting to play with them , and sometimes not , but still having a strong family bond			1
ultimately , it 's about the love between the sisters			1
that 's a message that many little children understand			1
there are also good lessons about overcoming struggles and facing life challenges			1
but , what 's interesting about preschoolers , in particular , is there 's this loyalty and unrelenting interest to watch this movie over and over again			1
part of it is because it was so well done , but there are some themes that younger kids can really identify with			1
my 4 - year - old daughter told me that she also liked that it did n't have a witch			2
i would n't have thought that until she said it , but it made me more thoughtful about all the other movies -- great movies -- that have scary witches and themes in them			2
this was something that little kids under 5 are n't going to have nightmares about			0
@entity1 : why is not having a witch important to a preschooler ? @entity40 : when you 're an adult , you 've heard a lot of these stories , like " @entity120 " or " @entity121 , " and you forget the power they can have			0
it 's helpful to have a child 's point of view on this			2
kids are living in this world where the line between what 's real and what 's not really is blurry , and because they have such vivid imaginations , witches and monsters can feel very real			2
as adults , we may see these villains or monsters as a way to tell a story or a lesson , but when children are in the moment of being scared , they are caught up in the fear and not in finding the larger lesson			2
@entity38 : i used to work in the film industry , and as adults , we 're told that we need conflict to drive drama			2
take @entity154 ; there are always dire stakes			0
or movies like " @entity158 " and " @entity159 , " where the mother or father die			0
these are serious issues and themes , and sometimes little kids are n't ready to process and understand these ideas			2
@entity1 : what about the characters seem so easy for kids to empathize with ? @entity38 : preschooler imaginations are really strong , and so they respond really well to stories with magical realism			0
in " @entity4 , " princess @entity28 has these powers to control ice and snow -- and that really captures kids ' imaginations			2
when you 're small , you do n't feel powerful			0
everyone is always dictating what you can and can not do			0
having a character they can empathize with that has these powers can make them feel more empowered , as well			0
@entity40 : that magical piece is exciting and is one of the things that really sets this movie apart from others			0
another aspect that kids see themselves in @entity28 and @entity29 is the impulsiveness			0
parents are constantly trying to teach their little ones how to self - regulate their emotions , how to behave , how to sit down			2
@entity28 is constantly trying to tame or control her emotions -- and while this is something that is salient to everyone throughout their lifetimes , this is something preschoolers deal with all the time			1
@entity1 : the song " @entity14 " : it 's everywhere , and kids ca n't stop singing it			1
what is it about this anthem ? @entity40 : my 4 - year - old came home and learned the song before we had even seen the movie			0
one of the lines she and all her friends connected to was " be the good girl that you always have to be			0
" and when they sing it , they wag their fingers like they do in the movie			0
i think it looks a lot like something they see and hear from parents -- be a good girl or boy , do n't do this or that -- so part of it is copying what they frequently hear			0
but when i asked my daughter what she thought the song was about , she said it was about " @entity28 being happy and free , and nobody bothering her			0
" that 's a message that everyone wants : to be happy and free			0
here 's when you 'll get to see that ' @entity4 ' short film			1

@entity3 's " frozen " is the top - grossing animated film of all time
psychologists say the *success* of " frozen " involves *universal* themes about family and being good
" @entity14 " appeals to children who seek happiness , freedom and struggle to control their impulses
