" other drivers from the same company had " complained of hazing rituals " on that bus specifically			1
but they " were instructed by @entity143 administration to ignore it and ( told ) that @entity6 was paying for it and could do what they want , " according to the lawsuit			1
however , @entity93 said the bus company has " never seen this kind of behavior " from the band			1
champion collapsed in @entity80 on the bus , which was carrying members of @entity6 's @entity155 after a november football game that included a halftime performance by the group			1
