-- this is no treasure hunt for a casket of gold at the bottom of the ocean			0
instead , it 's like looking for a needle in a haystack , with this search potentially for no more than a few partly rotten timber frames on @entity12 's sea floor			1
for years , the whereabouts of one of the most famous ships in nautical history -- @entity17 -- has remained a mystery			1
" i do n't like to call it treasure as there 's no gold or silver , " dr @entity19 , the executive director of @entity21 @entity20 , a not - for - profit organization set up in 1992 set up to study the area 's maritime history , told @entity0			2
" but it 's an intellectual treasure			2
" the @entity17 is now believed to have been intentionally sunk -- in a new life and under a new name -- during the @entity32 in 1778			1
endeavour is endemic to every @entity36 and @entity37 child 's education with a rich @entity39 and @entity40 history to boot			2
it was the boat on which captain @entity42 achieved the first recorded contact with the east coast of @entity36 , @entity45 , and the first circumnavigation of @entity37			1
@entity42 also provided the first accurate map of the @entity48 and is believed to have shaped the world map more than any other explorer in history			1
so how exactly did the @entity53 vessel get from exploring undiscovered far flung lands to lying in waters off the east coast of the @entity40 , sharing the ocean floor with torpedoes and other 18th century vessels ? a visit by @entity61 to the @entity62 , now @entity63 , in @entity64 uncovered the fact that @entity17 had been sold into private hands and was known as the @entity67 by the time of its demise			1
" @entity67 was the first lord of the admiralty at the time so the name makes sense -- a nod by its private owner , " she says			0
" we know from its size , dimension and these records that the @entity83 was the @entity17			1
" in its new guise , it was used to house @entity87 prisoners before it was one of 13 ships scuttled in a bid to stop a @entity92 invasion at @entity21			1
" the @entity40 army was assembled on the mainland and the @entity92 sent a fleet to help , " she continues			0
" there 's speculation that had the @entity92 fleet succeeded on that day , the revolution would have ended in @entity21 rather than linger on for five more years			1
" the @entity39 knew they were at great risk so they ordered 13 ships out to be scuttled in a line to blockade the city			1
they were sunk in fairly shallow waters			0
the @entity92 realized they could n't get close to the city and had to stay away but they still cannoned the city			0
" it is a far cry from its previous existence , arriving in @entity116 ( part of the greater metropolis that is @entity119 now ) in 1770			1
it was a voyage on which it first came close to its demise by running aground on @entity36 's @entity124 , a section later renamed @entity125 , which @entity42 navigated in the dark and from which he escaped by ditching weapons on board to lighten the load of the vessel			1
it is now believed to rest alongside 12 other vessels in a two - square - mile area where that conjoined scuttling took place eight years later			1
nine of the ships have already been located -- the most recent just last month -- and there is every chance that @entity17 could already be among those nine , although reaching that conclusion is a slow and pain - staking process			1
simple math would suggest there is a 70 % chance @entity61 and her team have already dived among the 300 - tonne ship 's ruins			2
in recent weeks , the quest has been picked up courtesy of a new partnership with @entity151 , located in @entity119 just a short boat ride from the @entity116 that @entity42 first encountered			1
head of research dr @entity153 is a maritime archaeologist whose phd was on @entity157 and who has dived with regularity in @entity12			1
in @entity36 , the countdown has begun to 2020 and the 250 - year anniversary of @entity42 's arrival on @entity36 soil			1
@entity153 admits that finding the ship , of which a replica has been made and was launched in 2012 , would be a major fillip			0
" i 'm 60 years old and growing up there was a picture of @entity42 and the @entity169 in most school rooms , " he recalls			1
" it 's obviously a massive part of @entity36 's heritage			1
" however , finding @entity17 is no certainty			2
he adds : " it 's absolutely possible it might have been destroyed			2
@entity177 is very busy and there 's 13 ships there , @entity40 and @entity181			1
it 's like an underwater jigsaw puzzle			0
" the search is done using a variety of methods such as sight sonar , which he likens " to shining a torch on the ocean floor " , as well as @entity191			0
@entity61 is a realist too but is confident in the outcome			0
" i do n't know if we 'll find all 13 but i think we have a good chance , " she says			0
" it may have been salvaged or destroyed when the harbor was dredged but we do n't think that happened			0
we have a great chance of finding @entity17			2
" unlike her @entity36 counterparts , she is not solely obsessed with finding the one ship but with all of them , in her quest for greater maritime knowledge of @entity40 and @entity39 vessels at that time			0
if and when @entity17 is properly found , who does she belong to ? all @entity53 vessels still belong to @entity39 wherever they end up coming to rest			2
privately owned vessels , however , like the @entity67 , as she became known , are a different matter			0
and when uncovered she will belong to @entity21 , although getting to that point was not without its concerns			0
" there 's no gold in the vessel so there was n't an issue of treasure salvers , " she explains			2
" but with the history of @entity17 , there was a concern of someone trying to get to her			2
but a law is now in place that she belongs to @entity21 although that does n't mean we wo n't share her			0
" the waters in the harbor are murky and visibility , at best , is no more than six feet			0
that combined with the cost of equipment and man power -- with limited financial resources -- makes it a slow process			0
the state of preservation depends how much the timber frames of the vessels are under silt , which because of their lack of oxygen effectively preserve the wood			0
for @entity61 , those murky waters have become her life 's work			0
the search for that particular treasure goes on .			0

the search for @entity42 's @entity17 centers on two square miles in @entity12
@entity42 helped shape the map of the world on board the vessel from 1770
for years , its whereabouts remained but it is now thought it was scuttled in 1778
it is part of a total of 13 18th century ships under water in @entity177
