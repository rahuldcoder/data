the average high school graduation rate in @entity2 's biggest urban school districts , which serve large numbers of children from very disadvantaged backgrounds , is only about 50 %			1
in most cities , the figure is even lower for @entity10 - @entity9 males			2
unfortunately , remarkably few strategies have been shown to improve the schooling outcomes of disadvantaged children , particularly once they reach adolescence			1
this has led many people to conclude that the harmful effects of poverty are already so entrenched by adolescence that improving academic learning for low - income teens is not feasible			1
many experts have called for focusing instead on vocational education for these youth or just doubling down on early childhood			0
given all this , some may even question the prospects for success of president @entity31 's new initiative to help young minority men , @entity33			0
we believe it 's premature to conclude that by adolescence , it 's too late to improve schooling outcomes			0
few approaches have addressed one of the central challenges facing so many urban schools : the wide variation in students ' academic levels by the time they reach middle and high school			1
consider trying to teach math to a classroom of 25 to 30 students when some students are at grade level and some are seven or even 10 years behind			0
now imagine the same situation from the students ' perspective			0
asking kids to sit through material so far beyond their knowledge is a recipe for disengagement and dropout			0
what urban school systems need is a " safety net " to catch students who start falling behind and get them back to up to grade level so they can re-engage with regular classroom instruction			0
this safety net must include academic instruction that is both individualized and intensive			0
educators have long known that one - on - one or small - group tutoring is the most effective way to teach people anything			1
but most urban school systems struggle with the costs of having one teacher in a room with 25 ( or more ) students ; how could we ever have a class size of just one or two students per instructor ? one possible answer comes from @entity85 of @entity86 , a nonprofit organization that runs charter schools and a teacher training program and provides tutoring services to urban districts			1
match had the insight that teaching one or two students at a time eliminates some of the biggest challenges involved in teaching a whole classroom of students ( like classroom management )			0
many more people can be good at tutoring compared with being good at classroom teaching ; extensive teacher experience and training are not required			0
this enables @entity91 to expand the pool of recruits and focus on those with strong math skills who are willing to devote a year to public service for just a modest stipend			0
this makes the incredibly high dosage of the @entity91 tutoring model feasible			1
@entity91 has partnered with urban school districts in cities across the country to provide this " tutoring on steroids " model to hundreds of students in each city			1
the cost of providing this type of intensive tutoring is between $ 2,000 and $ 3,000 per student per year			0
of course , the education field is full of good ideas that do n't pan out in practice ; how does this @entity91 tutoring model actually work in practice ? how effective is it really ? last year , our @entity130 tried to answer this question by carrying out a randomized controlled trial of the sort that provides gold - standard evidence in medicine but which remains far too rare in education			2
we randomly assigned 106 male ninth - and 10th - graders in one @entity141 public high school to receive match - style tutoring for a year and to participate in a promising non-academic program called becoming a man , developed and delivered by the @entity141 nonprofit @entity145			1
our study showed that program participation for just six months improved student math test scores by an amount that is equal to what the average @entity2 high school student learns in three years			2
( or put differently , the effect equals about 60 % of the black - white test score gap in data collected for @entity2 students overall			2
) the program also improved math grades , reduced course failures , increased school attendance and increased by nearly 50 % the likelihood that youth were " on track " for graduation according to the @entity163 on - track indicator			1
the cost of providing students with both intensive individualized math tutoring and the opportunity to participate in @entity170 was about $ 4,400 per student per year			0
while this may seem expensive , the benefits of the program were so large that the cost - effectiveness of these programs compares favorably to other social investments that have been shown to be effective ( e.g. early childhood education , cash transfers from the @entity178 , or reductions in class sizes )			2
moreover , cities like @entity141 currently receive millions of dollars from the federal government to support tutoring , which in principle could be repurposed to cover the costs of providing match - style tutoring to students who need an academic safety net			1
our study results would be striking anywhere but are all the more so because the high school students in our study come from what is perhaps @entity141 's most disadvantaged , dangerous @entity195 neighborhood			1
whether this can be equally effective at large scale is the next key question to answer ; our team is currently working on this in a much larger - scale experiment under way in 21 public high schools across @entity141			1
we think there are two important lessons here			0
the first is a policy lesson for urban school systems : they need something individualized and intensive , like @entity91 tutoring , as a safety net to help prevent students who start falling behind from falling completely through the cracks			2
but there is also a larger lesson here that is relevant for social policy and criminal justice , not just education : it 's not too late to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds even once they reach adolescence .			2

@entity227 , @entity228 : graduation rates for big urban schools about 50 %
many believe academic learning not feasible when disadvantaged kids reach teen years
they say program of small - group tutoring raised kids ' *performance* considerably
*writers* : it worked in @entity141 , why not elsewhere ? @entity245 is not to give up with teens
