@entity0 -- if @entity5 and the @entity6 were @entity8 friends , the relationship between the world 's two largest democracies would undoubtedly be " complicated			1
" it is no secret the two countries have endured a rocky period			0
and yet , as @entity6 secretary of state @entity14 arrives in @entity5 this week , there are clear signs of a rapprochement			1
in a speech monday in @entity18 , @entity14 previewed the message he is bringing to @entity0 , echoing president @entity21 's famous words about @entity5 and the @entity6 forming this century 's " defining partnership			1
" for an address that was played out on television screens across @entity5 , @entity14 cleverly ticked off the key boxes : he praised new prime minister @entity26 and spoke repeatedly of two confident nations that were " natural partners ... connected by core values			2
" crucially , @entity14 talked about boosting trade between the two nations from $ 100 billion to five times that amount -- a surge that would rank @entity5 as a bigger trading partner than @entity35 , the @entity36 , @entity37 or @entity38			1
@entity14 said all the right things			2
now it 's @entity0 's turn			0
what will @entity26 say ? world leaders tend to have a wonderful way of exaggerating friendships in public			0
everyone is a best friend , a special relation , an age - old ally			0
even so , in politics , rhetoric is important ; it is certainly a first step toward repairing relations			0
in fact , one of the goals of @entity14 's visit is to lay the groundwork for an even more important visit : when @entity26 visits the @entity6 in september and meets @entity21			1
there , too , one can expect all the rhetorical niceties of political getting - to - know - one - another			0
but very soon both sides will also want to see deliverables			0
that 's where things might get tricky			0
the @entity68 's @entity67 says @entity5 - @entity6 ties " will improve or deteriorate based on the performance of @entity5 's economy			1
" as @entity67 describes it , the @entity6 -- unlike @entity38 , for example -- does not have a large pool of government money to invest in @entity5 ; the real money needs to come from private investors , over which @entity18 has little control			1
the key , then , will be whether @entity5 can make itself an attractive destination to grow money			2
can @entity5 become an easier place to do business ? can it truly open up the way many other @entity86 nations have ? can it finally live up to expectations ? according to one survey by the networking site @entity92 , no other country 's business leaders are as positive about the global economy as @entity5 's			1
some 71 % of senior business leaders in @entity5 expect an improvement in the global economy , up from 51 % before @entity26 was elected in may			2
by comparison , only 44 % of @entity6 business leaders and 26 % of @entity35 business leaders are positive about the world economy			2
@entity5 's business leaders smell opportunity and success			1
@entity26 's challenge will be to convert that bullishness into results			0
some are wondering whether he 's been too slow off the blocks			0
a @entity110 editorial says " optimism over @entity26 is evaporating fast			0
" the @entity113 columnist @entity112 wonders whether @entity26 's government has already lost a sense of credible control			0
one particularly vexing example is @entity5 's handling of the @entity120 talks			1
while most economists agree on the need for speeding up global trade , @entity5 -- supported by the likes of @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 -- emerged as an unlikely roadblock to a global deal last week , seeking instead to retain the ability to stockpile and subsidize grain			2
analysts say it was likely a play by @entity26 to secure farmers ' support in rural @entity5			0
behind the scenes , @entity14 will no doubt pressure @entity26 to reverse his stance			0
it may turn out to be yet another hurdle in the relationship			0
ultimately , however , @entity26 's no. 1 priority will be to grow @entity5 's economy , and that does n't hinge solely on foreign investment			1
great gains are to be made in cutting red tape , tackling corruption and creating jobs to tap the vast growth potential of @entity5 's youthful population			1
if @entity26 succeeds in that task , the greatest beneficiaries will of course be @entity5 but it will also create a rising tide , lifting the @entity6 and the rest of the world			1
@entity14 will know all too well that what is good for @entity26 and @entity5 , will likely be good for @entity18 as well			2
at a time when all the world seems like a mess , there are few losers -- and many winners -- if the world 's two biggest democracies make nice and hit the reset button .			1

@entity6 secretary of state is visiting @entity5 in hopes of improving relations
@entity172 : @entity14 is rightly *focused* on economic ties , *including* trade
real test of improved trade will rest in the performance of @entity5 's economy , he says
@entity172 : @entity182 's two biggest democracies should work together
