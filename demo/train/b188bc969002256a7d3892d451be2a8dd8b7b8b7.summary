for @entity2 controlling owner @entity1 , " a light bulb went off			1
" in a 2012 e-mail addressing the troubles the franchise faced in attracting more affluent white season - ticket holders , @entity1 said he had taken a look around @entity8 and noticed a few things			1
first , the audience was 70 % black , he wrote			2
but that was n't all			0
the stadium 's bars were 90 % black			0
there were few fathers and sons at the games			0
the music played in the arena was hip - hop , and the after - game concerts were either rap or gospel acts			2
" then i start looking around at other arenas			0
even ( @entity31 ) @entity31 with its affluent black community never has more than 15 pct black audience , " he wrote			2
read the email in its entirety now , he 's losing his franchise because of the e-mail			0
@entity1 , who serves as managing partner and is the team 's representative on the @entity41 board of governors , announced in a statement sunday that he will sell his controlling stake in the team after an " e-mail two years ago that was inappropriate and offensive			1
" a man answering the phone at his @entity50 home told @entity51 that @entity1 was not taking any phone calls			2
in focusing on low attendance at @entity2 games and the need to boost season - ticket sales and corporate sponsors , @entity1 said in his statement , he had spoken with executives about diversifying the fan base and including more suburban whites			1
during those discussions , " i shared my thoughts on why our efforts to bridge @entity2 's racial sports divide seemed to be failing , " he wrote			0
" i trivialized our fans by making cliched assumptions about their interests ( i.e. hip hop vs. country , white vs. black cheerleaders , etc. ) and by stereotyping their perceptions of one another ( i.e. that white fans might be afraid of our black fans ) , " he said in his statement			1
" by focusing on race , i also sent the unintentional and hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black fans			1
" ' the black crowd scared away the whites ' in his 2012 e-mail to @entity2 general manager @entity84 , @entity1 wrote that before his @entity86 bought the @entity2 in 2003 , thousands of tickets were being given away , mostly to the black community , in an effort to make the arena appear less empty			1
it was a trend that continued for a couple of years after the @entity86 took over , he wrote in a seemingly informal e-mail rife with punctuation errors and misspellings			2
" my theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a signficant season ticket base , " he wrote			1
" i never felt uncomfortable , but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority			0
" @entity1 derided claims on fan websites that the arena is unsafe or in a bad part of town as " racist garbage , " but then suggested an array of changes inside the stadium , all based on race			2
" i have been open with our executive team about these concerns			0
i have told them i want some white cheerleaders and while i do n't care what the color of the artist is , i want the music to be music familiar to a 40 year old white guy if that 's our season tixs demo , " he wrote			1
he continued , " i have also balked when every fan picked out of crowd to shoot shots in some time out contest is black			0
i have even bitched that the kiss cam is too black			0
" things had changed since @entity1 implemented these suggestions , he wrote , boasting that the crowd was closer to 40 % black by 2012 , by his admittedly unscientific estimate			1
that was still four to five times higher than other @entity41 franchises , he wrote , " and my further guess is that 40 pct still feels like 70 ( percent ) to some whites at our games			1
our bars are still overwhelmingly black			0
" while noting this was a sensitive issue , @entity1 went on to declare it " far and way the number one reason our season ticket base is so low			2
and many of our black fans do n't have the spendable income which explains why our ( food and beverage ) and merchandise sales are so low			1
at all white thrasher games sales were nearly triple what they are at hawks games			0
" the year before @entity1 wrote the controversial email , the @entity86 sold its @entity157 team , the @entity156 , to a @entity159 ownership group that moved the team north of the border			1
it 's now called the @entity162			0
comparisons to @entity164 in his sunday statement , @entity1 said the @entity41 should have no tolerance for racism , a sentiment he also expressed during a @entity51 interview earlier this year when he talked about @entity164 , the @entity170 owner who was caught making racist remarks on tape			1
team owners behaving badly discussing @entity164 's reluctance to sell the team after the scandal broke , @entity1 said in may that , as a fellow team owner , he could n't be partners with someone who holds those types of views			2
" i think i speak for all of my partners when i say we were all deeply offended			0
we all quickly spoke out against the words we heard on that tape , " @entity1 said			0
@entity41 commissioner @entity186 , who brought the hammer down on @entity188 , called @entity1 's 2012 email " entirely unacceptable " and commended @entity1 for self - reporting to the league office			1
@entity1 told the league in july about the august 2012 e-mail , and the @entity41 conducted an investigation , the statement said			1
" ( @entity1 ) shared with me how truly remorseful he is for using those hurtful words and how apologetic he is to the entire @entity41 family -- fans , players , team employees , business partners and fellow team owners -- for having diverted attention away from our game , " @entity186 said			1
the league will work with the @entity2 to determine the appropriate sale process for the team , @entity186 said			0
@entity2 ceo @entity209 will oversee team operations , the league said			0
in closing his statement , @entity1 said he was embarrassed by the email and apologized to the team and its fans			2
" to the @entity2 family and its fans , you have my deepest gratitude for the past ten years , " @entity1 wrote			1
" working with this team and its extraordinary executives , coaching staff , and players has been one of the highlights of my life			0
i am proud of our diverse , passionate , and growing legion of @entity2 fans , and i will continue to join you in cheering for the best team in the @entity41			2
" according to the @entity2 website , @entity1 , a former journalist , co-founded @entity230 , a portfolio of business information companies , and is a founding shareholder and former board member for @entity235 , a technology media company .			0
