" i want to thank all those who had faith in me and i want to speak again about @entity40 and @entity41 ( @entity41 ) and to pay tribute to them one last time			0
" " each time is different			0
but i would say that this second @entity5 is more emotional , because my mother and my son ( who joined him on stage ) are here			0
" @entity0 won with 27.99 % of the votes ahead of @entity11 ( 24.72 % ) while @entity14 was third ( 23.36 % ) according to @entity50 , who jointly organize the award with @entity6			1
