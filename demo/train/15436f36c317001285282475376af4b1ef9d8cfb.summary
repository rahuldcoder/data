-- as @entity2 , charged with murder in the killing of an unarmed black teenager , took the stand on tuesday in his own defense , once again the nation focused on @entity8 , gun violence , and the evolution of self - defense			1
his testimony crystallized important points in this case			1
@entity2 is not @entity15 : we have to stop drawing comparisons between the @entity2 case and that of @entity15 , accused of killing unarmed teenager @entity20			1
about the only thing in common between the two cases is that a human being lost his life , and another human being is the defendant			0
oh , and @entity28 , the prosecutor , who has had the roulette wheel of high - profile cases pick out his number twice in two years : he has been involved in both cases			0
but even then , the cases are nothing alike			0
@entity15 's was a strong self - defense case			1
@entity2 's is a comparatively weak self - defense case			1
@entity15 fired one shot and waited around for the police			2
@entity2 squeezed off 10 rounds -- then took off and got a pizza			1
the differences are so great that they should not be compared			0
@entity2 is more significant for the self - defense issues raised in the case			1
@entity44 have taken the stand ? many were surprised when @entity2 took the stand in his defense -- conventional wisdom among defense attorneys is that defendants should not			2
after all , when was the last time a high - profile defendant did that ? @entity15 certainly did not			2
the rules of evidence and testimony are a one - sided affair , in which the cross-examining prosecutor has all the advantages			2
if the prosecution can not meet its burden , or the defense can make its case without the defendant 's testimony , then there is often little to gain and much to risk in putting a defendant on the stand			1
@entity2 's problem is that the prosecution has met its burden , and the defense can not make its case without his testimony			1
in the @entity15 case , the defense was able to establish the defendant 's reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily harm through photos of his wounds			1
sure , @entity15 could have taken the stand to say " i was scared , " but the defense team made a risk analysis : if they already established objective evidence of his fear , they could avoid the massive risk of his being torn apart on the stand			1
in the @entity2 case , there is very little objective evidence of an aggressor placing @entity2 in fear of his life , so he had to tell the jury how afraid he was			1
@entity2 's testimony , then , will largely determine whether these jurors find him guilty or not guilty			1
so what did we learn from his testimony ? opinion : @entity8 shooter saw black , thought ' threat ' preparation helps : @entity2 's attorneys did a good job preparing him for his testimony			1
if @entity2 did a bad job of hiding his preparation , a jury might see through that , but that 's on @entity2 -- not his lawyers			2
notice how @entity2 crowbarred the words " death " and " imminent " into his direct testimony			2
remember , the jury instructions at the end of the case will have those words in them			0
the defense hopes the jury will make a connection with the judge 's authoritative instruction on the law , and the defendant 's own words about his state of mind , as in : " hey , the judge said he must have fear of ' imminent ' harm , and he said the word ' imminent , ' so he had the reasonable fear ! " injecting these words also allows his attorneys to argue those facts in closing argument			1
of course , merely stating a fear of imminent death does not make it a reasonable fear of imminent death , but words alone can have a subconscious effect			2
flight as consciousness of guilt : " the wicked man fleeth , when no man pursueth			0
@entity2 left the scene of this crime , and it will be critical to determine why			0
flight to avoid prosecution may be considered " consciousness of guilt " : evidence of guilt the jury may consider along with other evidence in the case			0
of course , if he left for another reason , like fear for his life , then the flight is not as damaging			0
as with many things , we can not look into @entity2 's mind , so we have to evaluate circumstantial evidence , and now his own testimony			1
@entity2 testified about being afraid of vengeance by " local gangsters			0
" that 's good strategy by his lawyers , to establish an ongoing fear that explains his fleeing the scene			0
however , the jury may have heard that instead as him stating his belief that trash - talking men of color are usually gangsters			0
@entity2 may have missed the mark on this point , though his purpose was clear			0
also damaging was his weak answer to the critical question : why did n't you go to the police right away ? his answer ? " i did n't think i did anything wrong			0
" sir , you just shot up a @entity193 parking lot like the @entity194			0
you may not think you did anything wrong , but do n't you think the police might at least want to fill out some paperwork ? perhaps ask you a few questions ? strangely , @entity2 's flight -- something he did after the killing -- may be the most damaging piece of evidence against him			1
the car filled with bullet holes : @entity2 blasted 10 shots into the car			2
that 's a problem for him			0
the jury is very likely to conclude that firing multiple shots is evidence of intent to kill or is a sign of excessive force			0
this is why @entity2 's testimony needed to put the jury in the heat of the moment , to show them how fast shots are fired ; how close the aggressor was ; that an aggressor can keep approaching after one shot ; and how long it takes in a deadly situation to realize that the threat is over			1
the defense needs to convince the jury that even after @entity2 shot 10 times , really only a couple of seconds had elapsed and he still believed there was a real threat			1
consider how different the case would sound to you if @entity2 testified that he fired 10 shots over the wide span of a minute -- which he did not			2
a minute would make @entity2 look like a cool , detached serial killer , who took his time executing unarmed victims			0
the number of shots is tied directly to the time it took to squeeze them off , which in turn is tied directly to the urgency of @entity2 's actions			1
@entity2 needed to score some major points here and bring the jury into the crisis and the moment with him			2
the verdict will show if he was successful			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			0

@entity255 : @entity2 's testimony *highlights* important legal points in his murder case
@entity255 : @entity2 is not @entity15 ; his self - defense case is comparatively weak
he says @entity2 had to prove he had a reasonable fear of being seriously harmed
@entity255 : also , he had to explain why he fled , why he shot 10 rounds into the teens ' car
