-- @entity1 is in a bind			1
he must present himself as a staunch conservative in order to appeal to skeptical right - wing voters in the @entity7 presidential primary , but if he plays it too conservative , he 'll alienate moderate voters in the general election			1
@entity1 adviser @entity11 is not overly concerned , though			1
on wednesday , he expressed confidence the campaign would hit the " reset button " after the nomination and redraw @entity1 as a moderate candidate			1
" everything changes , " he explained on @entity0 , " it 's almost like an @entity19			1
you can kind of shake it up and we start all over again			2
" @entity11 's comparison of his boss ' campaign to a toy tablet ignited a political firestorm			2
internet wags imagined @entity1 as an @entity19 drawing , while his primary opponents , @entity31 and @entity32 , gleefully brandished @entity33 at campaign events			1
@entity1 rushed to contain the damage by promising to be a true conservative forever			1
@entity11 has accidentally stumbled on something profound			2
he may not have much experience with @entity19 technology			1
with all due respect to that iconic @entity45 toy , its legendary reset abilities have never been quite up to scratch			2
dark smudges tend to mar the perimeter of its silvery slate , and no matter how vigorously you shake the thing , you can never quite obliterate the residue			1
even so , the real - life @entity19 in all its splotchy glory actually offers a better metaphor for @entity45 politics than the fantasy of a clean post-primary slate			1
it 's not that @entity11 's contempt for the cognitive capabilities of the voters is entirely off the mark			1
the collective memory of the @entity45 electorate is notoriously short			2
think you 're smarter than the average voter ? identify the authors of these political promises : " he wo n't streamline the federal government and change the way it works , cut 100,000 bureaucrats and put 100,000 new police officers on the streets of @entity45 cities , but i will			2
" " and after we fund important priorities in the ongoing operations of our government , i believe we ought to pay down national debt			0
and so my budget pays down a record $ 2 trillion in debt over the next 10 years			0
" " my plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce , return excess money from donors and stay within the public financing system for the general election			0
" ( answers : @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 ) ok , maybe you 're one of the smart ones , but most people would have to guess			0
that 's why it 's not very hard for presidential candidates to shift from primary promises that appeal to the base to general election proposals that appeal to moderates and independents			1
even issues a few months old go rapidly stale when the pressure comes off			0
@entity109 @entity7 have recently violated the historic debt deal they agreed to less than a year ago , gambling that voters wo n't hold them to it			2
they seem to be right			0
the media has barely covered the story ; the public is n't interested			0
but @entity45 voters do n't forget everything			1
some words and ideas seem to permanently embed themselves in our collective psyche			0
try identifying the authors of these quotes : " read my lips : no new taxes " " i am not a crook			0
" " tear down this wall			0
" " i did not have sexual relations with that woman			0
" easy , right ? @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity94			0
how about this one ? " senator , i served with @entity136 , i knew @entity136 , @entity136 was a friend of mine			0
senator , you 're no @entity136			0
" most @entity45 probably remember very little about vice president @entity140 , let alone sen. @entity141 , but this brief exchange during a vice-presidential debate was unforgettable			2
pithy one - liners tend to fix themselves in our mental machinery far more easily than complex ideas			1
they capture a personality , a moment or an idea in a few compelling or amusing words			0
apt labels and nicknames also tend to stick : @entity134 the great communicator , @entity94 the comeback kid , @entity157 the maverick , @entity159 the flip - flopper			1
once embedded in the great @entity19 that is @entity45 political consciousness , these ideas can not be shaken free for decades , sometimes even centuries			2
people still say , " @entity164 and @entity165 too " some 170 years after the campaign slogan was coined , though few have any idea who it referred to or why			0
@entity170 will tell which words and ideas endure from the 2012 presidential election , but @entity11 has offered us a prime candidate			0
the @entity19 perfectly captures voters ' perception of @entity1 as an opportunistic politician anxious to redraw himself according to the political requirements of the moment , a man who leans left in @entity182 and right in @entity183			1
the notion provokes the mistrust of conservatives , the cynicism of moderates and the amusement of liberals			0
whether the label is fair is beside the point			0
@entity1 can defend his ideological consistency all year long			1
nonetheless , when it comes to pithy words that stimulate the country 's political imagination , you can shake and shake and shake , but you can never quite obliterate that residue			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			2

@entity202 : @entity19 gaffe - turned - joke *highlights* bind @entity1 was already in
he says in truth @entity19 leaves residue on screen after a shake , a better *analogy* here
he says voters forget actual policy promises ; they remember *gaffes* , one - liners , labels
@entity202 : @entity1 can defend consistency all he wants , but it 's the new pithy gibe that will stick
