-- one week after leaving , my mom 's words still echo in my ears : " leave @entity5 now , please			1
do n't think about us			0
i have many things to worry about			0
" i entered @entity5 on november 5 to help an @entity9 delegation there until the morning of november 11			2
my intention was to help the delegation and then have two full days with my family after the delegates left			2
but with tensions ratcheting up , my family in @entity5 was fearful the @entity17 crossing with @entity18 would be closed and i would be stuck			1
to leave my extended family in such dangerous circumstances and return to my husband and three children in @entity23 was heartrending			1
but now it is worse			0
to see @entity9 - made @entity26 fighter jets pounding @entity5 just days after my departure is agony			1
i lost the argument for an extra two days with my family the moment i said i " planned " to spend those extra days with them			0
my sister - in - law , @entity32 , pounced on the words : " nothing can be planned here			0
everything is in the @entity26 military 's hands			1
the @entity26 government can undo plans and dreams in an instant			1
looking into my mom 's eyes , i felt cowardly to desert them			0
i hugged her and told her to stay safe			0
but deep in my heart i knew that there is no safety in @entity5			2
that was evident on sunday when the @entity26 military bombed the @entity53 household and instantly decimated three generations of the family			1
read related : @entity5 's victims too young to understand , but not to die the terrifying power of the @entity26 military was already made clear at the beginning of the latest onslaught with the haunting photograph of a young @entity62 journalist grieving his dead infant			1
@entity26 claims to operate with pinpoint accuracy , but consistently kills a high proportion of civilians			2
in fact , the @entity9 delegation spoke to the grief - stricken father and mother of @entity71 , a young boy killed on november 8 while playing soccer outside his home			0
these @entity74 are important witnesses against the claim that @entity76 bear full culpability for this escalation			2
in fact , it was our children being killed , not the @entity26 children			1
as i joined the @entity9 delegation for the long trip back to @entity86 , i was riven with emotion			0
usually , the @entity9 delegates would greet me with cheers , claps and smiles			0
this time there was silence , grim faces , tears and no words			0
everyone was waiting to hear from me			0
" i have been ordered to leave , " i said , " and i am frustrated and angry			0
" i burst into tears			0
will i see my family again ? i do n't know			0
war is unpredictable as @entity26 's prime minister @entity101 and minister of defense @entity102 seem to have forgotten from their safe vantage points			1
what is unleashed today in the new @entity106 is not the same as the wars @entity26 unleashed in the years since 1948			2
the @entity108 means that the governments and people of the region are in much greater accord			0
the weak governments that looked the other way as @entity26 and the @entity9 subjugated @entity76 have been replaced by governments that may yet assert @entity76 rights in ways that are not merely symbolic			1
@entity118 @entity76 are now starting to confront the @entity26 military in ways that the weak @entity121 can not stop as readily as it did four years ago during @entity122			1
read related : @entity123 pound @entity26 , @entity5 as @entity101 alleges ' double war crime ' as the situation deteriorates , it is vital to note that this war need not have occurred			1
a fragile truce had taken hold for 48 hours , notwithstanding @entity76 frustration over two separate incidents in the previous week when @entity76 youth were killed playing soccer			2
in the opinion of many @entity76 , @entity101 planned this aggression			1
he wanted to be seen by the electorate as the man with the iron fist protecting @entity26 in the south of @entity26			2
palestinians were in his way			0
self - inflated analysts talk of " mowing the grass " to rein in @entity144 and other groups			0
but that mowing is terrifying civilians and destroying their neighborhoods			0
what do they think will become of the traumatized children who endure such brutal attacks from the sky and sea ? they will be no friends of @entity26			1
no , @entity26 is proving once again that it has no interest in becoming part of the region			2
but @entity26 's actions have been largely the same for 64 years			1
the one period of brief hope in the 1990s proved fleeting because @entity26 failed to stop its illegal settlement activity and made clear to @entity76 its intent was not a @entity76 state in the @entity118 , @entity5 , and @entity164 but a series of disconnected cantons			1
@entity102 has pledged continued military action against @entity5 and @entity101 has stated he hopes @entity144 and others " got the message			1
" there is no doubt that his message of widespread death and destruction has been widely received by all @entity76			2
i doubt , however , that the message will have the intended effect			0
instead , the fury of having one 's neighborhood battered by f - 16s and shells will likely unite @entity76 against an outside power that has besieged @entity5 since 2007 and controlled it since 1967			1
the inhumane blockade -- with approximately 80 % of @entity76 reduced to receiving food aid as @entity26 counts our calories to allow for anemia and stunting but not outright starvation -- leads me to conclude that bleak days remain our lot			1
yet there is one factor @entity101 fails to grasp : the spirit and will of @entity76 -- from @entity17 to @entity193 to @entity194 and the @entity76 refugee camps scattered throughout the @entity106 -- to achieve our freedom and rights			1
we will not relinquish our legitimate rights any more than @entity74 or black @entity199 in the 1950s			0
we will be bombed and bullied by @entity26 and the @entity200 , but in the end we will still demand our rights			2
as long as my family walks the planet , we retain the right to one day walk back to our village of @entity208 , a scant few miles from @entity5 , and to live there with rights equal to our new neighbors			1
my grandmother , who is enduring this terrible onslaught , has an inalienable right , property deed in hand , to return to the village of her childhood -- as do her children , grandchildren and great - grandchildren .			0

@entity223 's family begged her to leave @entity5 as tensions escalated
" the @entity26 government can undo plans and dreams in an instant , " @entity223 says
to @entity26 leaders : " what do they think will become of *...* children who endure such brutal attacks ? "
she believes @entity101 *underestimates* @entity76 ' will to achieve freedom and rights
