@entity0 -- scientists are to sequence the entire genome of @entity4 -- the @entity5 found buried beneath an @entity7 car parking lot -- in an attempt to discover once and for all what the long - missing monarch really looked like			1
experts hope the project will reveal the color of @entity4 's hair and eyes , and uncover the genetic markers for any health conditions he suffered , or might have been at risk of , had he not been killed , aged just 32 , at the @entity20 in 1485			1
" it should give us an insight into his genetic make - up , his predisposition to disease , " said @entity5 , the geneticist who will lead the genome project			2
@entity5 , who carried out the dna tests on the bones , proving their royal identity , said she was particularly keen " to see whether or not @entity4 was predisposed towards scoliosis , for example			1
" if the tests succeed , they should enable historians to tell just how accurate portraits of the controversial @entity5 are , and give them an insight into whether @entity42 propaganda in the decades after his death meant he was painted in a deliberately unflattering light			2
" there are no contemporary portraits of @entity4 , " said @entity5			2
" all the portraits that exist post-date his death by about 40 to 50 years onwards			0
so it 's going to be interesting to see what the genetic information provides in relation to what we know from the portraits			0
" @entity4 is best known as the hunchbacked anti-hero of @entity59 's play , whose physical deformities echo his villainous nature , and who is blamed for the murder of his nephews , the princes in the tower , but many modern historians believe that image is exaggerated , and have sought to rehabilitate his reputation			1
he will be the first known historical figure to have his genes studied in this way ; scientists have previously sequenced the genomes of @entity74 , a number of @entity76 , and most recently a hunter - gatherer from @entity78			0
sequencing the first human genome took 13 years and cost about $ 3 billion ; now it can be done for a fraction of that cost , in a matter of hours			2

their announcement in february 2012 that the almost - complete skeleton they had uncovered -- featuring a strikingly curved spine and deadly battle wounds -- was that of a king missing for more than 500 years ignited worldwide interest			0
but it also sparked controversy : an argument over where the bones will be reburied -- in @entity87 , close to where they were found , or in @entity106 , which some supporters believe would have been @entity4 's choice -- has developed into a lengthy and bitter legal battle , with no end in sight			1
wherever is eventually chosen as @entity4 's final resting place , the genome project will ensure the king leaves behind a lasting scientific legacy			1
" once he is reinterred , everything is reinterred , " said @entity5			0
" the bones , the samples , everything			0
we ca n't keep anything , and that 's the reason for doing this now , while we can			0
we have the technology , so this opportunity has come along at the right time			0
" once completed , the full details of @entity4 's genome will be published online , offering historians and scientists intriguing research opportunities			1
" as we know more and more about which genes are responsible for what , we can keep going back to check for evidence , " @entity5 said , adding that experts should be able to look for clues to everything from curly hair and obesity to lactose intolerance and heart disease			0
@entity5 said there was even the possibility , in future , of discovering clues to @entity4 's temperament			1
read more : @entity4 - the mystery of the king and the car park members of the public will also be able to access the genome , and even compare it to their own genome to see if they share a genetic link with the last @entity156 king			1
" we 're all related to @entity4 , it 's simply a matter of degree , " said @entity5 , " but some people would love dna evidence of that link , and this will mean they can check for matches , " though she cautioned that a genetic link is not the be-all and end - all of proving a royal family tie			1
" accurate documented genealogy is more proof of relatedness than @entity162 , but people see @entity162 as a kind of magic bullet to prove everything , " she said			0
one man who has both is @entity175 , @entity4 's closest living relative			1
@entity5 will also be sequencing @entity175 's genome , to look for any other genetic similarities between the pair -- aside from the matching mitochondrial dna which allowed her to positively identify the @entity87 remains as those of the long - dead @entity7 ruler			1
" @entity183 , @entity175 and @entity4 should not be genetically related any other way -- apart from the mitochondrial dna -- after so much time , but it will be really interesting to see if there are other similarities , " @entity5 said			2
the project , which is expected to cost about $ 165,000 ( Â £ 100,000 ) , is being jointly funded by the @entity189 , the @entity190 and @entity191 , the scientist who developed genetic fingerprinting , and who , like @entity5 , is a professor of genetics at the @entity195			0
it will be carried out in @entity87 and at the @entity197 in @entity198			2
so could the controversial @entity5 ever be cloned ? the experts insist that would be impossible -- for a host of reasons -- " you ca n't clone anything from fragmentary dna , " says @entity5			0
" practically , you ca n't -- and morally , you ca n't , " insists dr. @entity205 , head of medical humanities at the @entity189			0
" it 's a whole different ethical issue			0

scientists announce plans to sequence the entire genome of @entity4
@entity215 's remains were found buried beneath a parking lot in @entity7 city of @entity87 in 2011
tests may reveal @entity4 's eye and hair color , and predisposition to certain diseases
