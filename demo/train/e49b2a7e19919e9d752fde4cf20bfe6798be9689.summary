@entity0 -- the @entity3 government said wednesday it is holding a @entity5 man on immigration violations , but gave no indication why the man was deemed to be a threat to a commercial jet that was denied permission to overfly the @entity3 on sunday			1
however , the brother of @entity13 , the detained man , said @entity3 officials may be suspicious because of @entity13 's outspoken views about @entity3 policy in the @entity17 , his frequent comments on an internet website , and his recent travel to @entity21 in northern @entity22 to study @entity23			1
@entity24 described his brother as " confused " by the detention because he had been assured by @entity3 authorities while overseas that there was no impediment to his return to the @entity3			1
the case of @entity13 came to a head sunday when @entity3 authorities denied permission for the @entity35 flight he was on -- traveling from @entity36 , @entity37 , to @entity38 , @entity39 -- to overfly the @entity3			1
the flight was diverted to @entity40 , where @entity42 officials took custody of @entity13 before turning him over to @entity3 officials tuesday			1
@entity3 officials have since said that @entity13 was on the " no fly " list , compiled by the government , of people banned from flying in the @entity3			1
@entity48 , a @entity49 spokesman , said wednesday that @entity13 was questioned by @entity3 officials			2
" in the course of that interview process , he was determined to be inadmissible to the @entity3 and is currently being detained pending immigration proceedings , " @entity48 said			1
@entity13 admitted to having committed fraud when he applied for refugee status in @entity42 in october 2008 and to abandoning his " legal permanent residency " status in the @entity3 by departing the @entity3 for more than 10 months and applying for refugee status in @entity42 , a @entity3 official told @entity1 on condition of not being identified by name			1
immigration issues of that sort , however , do not typically put a person on the " no fly " list , which includes about 6,000 people , the official acknowledged			2
@entity3 officials declined to provide any further information about the matter			2
@entity13 's brother , contacted wednesday by @entity1 , said @entity13 had strong political beliefs but has insisted he had done nothing wrong			0
@entity24 said his brother was critical of @entity3 policies in the @entity17 and aired his views on @entity74 , which hosts @entity76 chat forums			2
several months ago , he said , his brother went to @entity21 in northern @entity22 to study @entity23			0
while in @entity21 , @entity13 received a call from his wife in @entity79 , saying she had been visited by @entity42 police looking for him			0
@entity13 then went to the @entity81 in @entity21 and was told there was no impediment to him returning home , according to his brother			0
@entity13 also called the @entity85 to check on his status , his brother said			0
@entity13 flew to @entity36 and on to @entity38 , and intended to travel to @entity87 , @entity0 , where their mother lives , his brother said			0
@entity24 said his brother 's arm was broken when he was removed from the aircraft in @entity40 , even though , he said , @entity13 did not resist			0
he said the family is trying to hire an immigration attorney to represent his brother .			0
