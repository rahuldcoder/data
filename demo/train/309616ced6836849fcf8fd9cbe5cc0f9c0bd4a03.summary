i ca n't help but feel humbled and grateful when i hear the stories of women who marched for women 's rights in the 1970s and the suffragists who fought for the right to vote			1
what they accomplished deserves more than a nod and lip service			0
we must honor them by making our generation 's mark on the concerns facing women today			1
unfortunately , that still includes goals we 've fought too long for , like reproductive rights			1
today is @entity20 and @entity21 is @entity22			1
as we celebrate all that women have accomplished in the struggle for gender equality , we are also redefining what counts as a " women 's issue			1
" gender - related violence worldwide , about one in three women is victim of gender - related violence			1
from military sexual assault , to domestic violence , to rape on college campuses , we must do more to prevent violence against women			1
many people think of sex trafficking as a " women 's issue , " but labor trafficking also has impact on women			2
some of the industries in which labor trafficking is common , including domestic work , are dominated by women			0
and in industries like agricultural work , women are singled out for sexual abuse or exploitation			0
i 've represented victims of human trafficking in @entity60 , which is a major trafficking destination because of its port , international airport , and proximity to @entity65 and @entity66			0
financially desperate adults are lured to @entity60 by traffickers , only to be forced to work as laborers in @entity71 's agricultural sector			0
runaway youth come to @entity60 to find stardom or a warm place to sleep on the street , but many will be exploited through pornography , a thriving industry in the @entity79			0
we have a responsibility to improve our current labor trafficking laws			0
education @entity85 sen. @entity84 said recently , look at how well women are doing at colleges across the country			2
what he failed to consider is that women are graduating not only with a degree , but with staggering level of student debt			0
instead of telling women that they 're doing just fine , we need legislators who are going to fight for students so they can attain the degrees they want and enter chosen professions without an insurmountable amount of debt			0
senator @entity84 also forgot to mention that some of the best - paying jobs , jobs in science , technology , engineering and math fields ( @entity106 ) , are still overwhelming dominated by men			2
only 3 % of tech startups are formed by women			0
we have a thriving tech industry , but men hold far more computer and mathematical occupations than women			2
why are n't more women getting tech jobs ? we need programs that promote @entity106 education for those who have historically been left out of these high - paying jobs			1
economic equality we often talk about the impact of pay discrimination on women 's pocketbooks because it costs women on average more than $ 10,000 annually and jeopardizes their retirement security			1
but we forget that many poverty issues also impact women			2
raising the minimum wage is actually a " women 's issue " because 64 % of minimum wage workers are women			0
women are increasingly becoming the sole or primary earners in their household , so economic issues that hold women back have huge impact on our entire economy			1
let 's help women financially support their families as we create more good - paying jobs in our communities			1
many women not only face pay discrimination in the workplace , but struggle at home as well , trying to provide care for their family on top of their job			2
women are still mostly the caretakers for their families , so they are disproportionately affected by the lack of guaranteed sick days and the lack of paid family leave			2
it is hard to overstate how far behind @entity162 is compared to our global competitors when it comes to these basic policies that protect families			0
when we talk about women 's issues , we must look comprehensively at the challenges all women face to ensure our policies reflect the support women truly need , because these concerns impact not only women , but their families and communities			1
our generation is ready to do that .			0
