a week before a possible government shutdown , the @entity0 spent time on a @entity3 bill that does n't fund any federal agencies , and even its supporters admit is already dead on arrival in the @entity8 - led @entity7			1
@entity0 @entity3 leaders are still building support for their spending bill , and are eying a vote next week -- potentially dec. 11 , the same day as the deadline when agencies run out of funds			1
but as time is running out to avoid a potential crisis , the @entity0 voted thursday to back a measure that 's designed to let @entity3 opponents of president @entity21 's executive actions on immigration vent their frustrations			1
the " @entity25 on @entity26 " was drafted by @entity24 @entity3 rep. @entity3			0
it states that the executive branch of government does not have the authority to stop deportations of certain categories of undocumented workers in the @entity34			2
it cleared the @entity0 in a 219 - 197 vote that was almost entirely along party lines			1
but this bill ca n't undo what the president has done , and even those conservatives who voted for it say it 's simply a messaging bill to assert @entity45 ' role in passing new laws			1
@entity47 causes headaches for @entity3 leaders			0
many @entity0 conservatives have been pressing speaker @entity51 to go further in responding to the president 's immigration policy , insisting that the @entity0 strip away any money in the annual government spending bill so it can prevent the @entity56 from carrying out its plans			1
but @entity51 and other @entity3 leaders do n't want to risk another shutdown , after the one last fall inflicted major political damage to the party			2
instead @entity3 leaders argue that a vote on this separate bill puts the @entity0 on record , and positions them to fight back against the president 's executive orders next year , when the @entity3 controls both the @entity0 and the @entity7			1
those hardliners who want to use the spending bill as leverage in the immigration fight say they back anything that disapproves of the president 's actions			1
but it 's not enough for them to get on board with the leaders ' plan to postpone any fight using the legislative branch 's power of the purse until next year			2
@entity82 rep. @entity82 of @entity83 called the bill " important first step " but said he was still not satisfied			0
" is this enough ? ultimately no , i think ultimately we need to defund the president 's ability to move forward , " @entity82 argued on the @entity0 floor			1
@entity51 appeared confident thursday that his spending proposal would pass , and predicted at his weekly press conference it would get bipartisan support			0
the speaker waved off making any changes to address concerns of conservatives			0
in what appeared to be a shot back at those @entity3 members who @entity51 said were " griping " about the funding bill , he said " this was their idea of how to proceed			0
" shutdown drama builds in @entity45 @entity8 denounced the bill and called it a waste of time			1
over and over @entity8 called on @entity109 to bring up bipartisan immigration legislation for a vote			0
@entity21 said at a college summit thursday that the @entity0 @entity3 bill would " force talented young people ... to leave our country			1
" " it does not make sense for us to want to push talent out rather than make sure that they 're staying here and contributing to society , " he said			0
" rather than deport students and separate families and make it harder for law enforcement to do its job , i just want @entity45 to work with us to fix a broken immigration system			2
" standing next to a life size poster for former @entity3 president @entity132 in the @entity0 chamber , @entity130 @entity8 rep. @entity129 defended @entity21 's action and compared what he did last month to action that @entity132 signed in the 1980s			1
" they did n't call @entity132 a tyrant , they did n't call him lawless			0
yet he said ' i would protect a million and a half undocumented people ' that you call illegal			0
he protected them , " @entity129 said			0
@entity24 @entity143 rep. @entity143 was one of seven @entity109 to oppose the bill			0
he told reporters he agrees with his @entity3 colleagues that the president did n't have the authority to act on his own , but he believes the proper response is to start working on immigration proposals to fix the system			2
" there is only way to do this - we have to pass legislation to deal with the issue , " @entity158 said , adding that the current immigration system " remains absolutely in a shambles			2
