-- the @entity1 know how to put on a show and this year -- the 60th anniversary of the end of hostilities in the @entity6 -- they 've gone all out for the @entity8			1
if you 've toyed with the idea of going , this is the summer to do it			0
it 's a lot easier to get into the @entity15 than you probably expect and the incredible spectacle that is the @entity8 officially runs until september 8 , though it is often extended			1
you go in knowing there will be 100,000 performers -- gymnasts , dancers , acrobats -- that the music will be loud and there will be fireworks and strobe lights , but nothing prepares you for the sheer scale of the production			0
it 's the @entity30 opening night a dozen times over with a camp director and an unlimited budget			2
half the people on the tour i went with opted to go a second night , hoping to catch some of the bits they missed the first time around			2
why now is the time to go why go now ? because this could well be the last year that @entity39 will be staged			1
@entity39 is not the @entity8 -- it 's the name of the theme the @entity8 have followed for the last 10 years or so -- a @entity43 - like folk tale			1
so while there will almost certainly be a @entity8 next year , it may not follow this theme			1
what 's more , without any anniversaries or significant dates to celebrate next year , it 's expected to be far more low - key than the great pomp and ceremony that defines this year 's show			1
@entity55 debates persist over whether tourists should visit @entity1 , a country with a poor human rights record			2
critics say tourist dollars help the repressive government , but others say the tourism money generated in @entity1 is minimal			2
to mark the 60th anniversary of the @entity6 armistice -- what @entity1 call the victory in the @entity6 -- no expense has been spared			1
new at the @entity8 regulars at the world 's largest choreographed gymnastics performance say this year 's show has plenty of new material , with familiar acts given a new twist			1
" i 've been about 50 times and 50 % of it was different this year , " says @entity76 of @entity78 - based @entity77			2
" there are whole new acts and there 's a lot more technology -- the digital screens , the arches on top of the stadium , all that 's new			0
" that new technology had a major hiccup the night i visited , july 27 -- @entity93			0
five minutes into the 90 - minute show there was a total blackout			0
power outages are everyday occurrences in @entity99 , but to have one at such a high - profile event was unusual			0
the spectacle was just kicking off -- a wall of students on the far side of the stadium , the " human pixels , " were flipping through books of colored cards to flash up messages and images , giant strobe lights rolled across the arena , the music was pounding , thousands of performers surged across the stadium -- and we were plunged into darkness			0
only the night before @entity1 leader @entity119 had sat in the stadium watching the very same performance with @entity123 vice-president @entity122			1
fortunately for show managers , the blackout did n't happen then			0
no one booed , no one jeered and five minutes later when the power came on and the show began again -- from the beginning -- there was a round of applause			0
" people live with blackouts all the time , " says @entity76			0
" it 's a sign that someone has been in @entity1 a while when the lights go out and they just keep talking or doing whatever they were doing			1
" military messaging dominates @entity1 are big on military motifs and this year they 've gone to town			1
even a flower show we visited had scores of missiles and tanks tucked in among the red " @entity153 " blossoms			0
at the @entity8 , a large gold medal -- to celebrate @entity155 -- floats above the @entity156 and massive video screens show footage from the @entity6 and a video of the long - range rocket launched earlier this year			1
given the massive show of military might and boys toys it 's no surprise our tour attracted a fair few of 20 - something men , but there 's something for everyone at the @entity8 -- anyone who loves musicals will be on @entity173 , there 's plenty of kitsch for the @entity177 and it 's a photographer 's dream shoot			1
foreigner reactions @entity181 , 24 , went to the @entity8 two nights running : " it was amazing , but i did get slightly concerned about all those kids spending time out of school , it 's a massive undertaking			1
" he was n't the only one in our group who was left wondering about the 20,000 children who spend months training intensively for the @entity8			2
briton @entity189 mused : " where else in the world could you martial thousands of school children , without paying them , and have them do something like that ? " the regulars in our group were quick to notice another new element this year -- at the end of the @entity39 performance there is a five - minute segment dedicated to international friendship , especially between @entity123 and @entity1 and @entity202			1
while the " human pixels " flashed up messages of peace and friendship , as well as a rainbow between @entity99 's @entity207 and @entity78 's @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity202 dancers strutted about on stage			1
the message of friendship with @entity123 came at the end of last year 's games , too			1
but the grand gesture towards @entity202 this year is new			1
what does it mean ? one of our guides said it was " about politics			0
" another said it was " more about economics			0
" no doubt they 're both right -- politics and economics make for cozy bedfellows and @entity1 is waking up to the reality that if it wants to get on , to progress , it needs to start pulling in some hard currency			2
that 's no doubt why visitors are made to feel so welcome , particularly at the country 's best known tourist attraction			0
currency matters foreigners are n't allowed to use the local currency -- the won -- and must bring cash in with them in either @entity243 dollars , euros or renminbi			0
@entity247 , i discovered however , offers by far the worst conversion rate			0
first - class tickets go for € 150 ( $ 159 ) , but this was conveniently rounded to 1,500 rmb ( $ 195 ) making it a good 20 % more expensive			0
second - class tickets cost € 100 and third - class tickets are € 80			0
if you go a second night , you get a free upgrade			0
the only way to see the @entity8 is by joining a tour			2
most tours leave from @entity78 and the tour company will arrange your @entity1 visa , travel to @entity99 , hotels , meals and @entity8 tickets			1
there 's still plenty of time to go this summer -- decide today and you could be there in 10 days			0
the best - established outfit is @entity78 - based @entity77 , which has been taking groups since 1993 and has good relationships in @entity1			2
@entity77 offers a host of itineraries from a two - day @entity274 , which includes a @entity99 city guide and @entity8 entry for € 790 ( $ 1,048 ) to a seven - night @entity277 that takes in the @entity278 as well as trip to the @entity280 , @entity281			2
@entity282 and more for € 1,690 ( $ 2,242 )			0
@entity283 is a @entity243 - based travel agency specializing in travel to @entity1 -- available tours include a seven - night trip that takes in the @entity8 for $ 2,690			1
@entity287 is another @entity243 - based tour operator that offers trips to @entity1 and other @entity290 destinations .			2

@entity1 put on a *magnificent* @entity39 show to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the @entity6
half of the show elements are new compared to last year 's show , says a @entity8 regular
this year 's show *highlights* the friendship with @entity123 and @entity202
