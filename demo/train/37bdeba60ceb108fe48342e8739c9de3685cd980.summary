@entity0 , @entity1 -- the dandy look has long been associated with the style of the quintessential gentleman			1
it 's elegant and sophisticated with sharp lines and immaculately tailored suits			2
but certain gentlemen in various parts of @entity11 have now taken the look to the next level			1
these dapper dressers can often be seen strutting down the streets of @entity16 or @entity17 , as is the case with the @entity20 's " sapeurs			2
" and now , thanks to up - and - coming " afro - dandy " designer @entity23 , the look has also emerged in the @entity1 capital of @entity0 -- but with a more local twist			1
classy and elegant , @entity23 's label @entity26 combines bold @entity11 patterns and textures with western accessories to produce wax - print bow ties , colorful pocket squares and infinite scarfs for " afro - dandies " in @entity1 and beyond			1
we sat down with sartorially chic @entity23 to chat all things dandy : how to get the look ; @entity11 influences ; style icons and who he 'd most like to see don his designs			1
@entity2 : tell me what you mean when you describe the @entity48 style as " afro - dandyism ? " @entity23 : it hits the nail on the head for my style and what i try to do with my pieces			1
the additional use of color , patterns , texture -- it 's uniquely @entity11			1
then going to boarding schools -- you had to have your shirt tucked in , tie done			2
so many different influences have had an impact on me and helped me deliver my personal style which i have integrated into @entity26			1
@entity2 : and what 's this different side of @entity11 that you want to show ? @entity71 : one of the reasons i started @entity26 of @entity74 was because i was actually going to school in the @entity76 , and i had so many questions about how life is in @entity1			1
many people had these negative assumptions			2
they had notions of how bad life was here , poverty , war			2
and it used to bug me a lot			2
@entity2 : so you got sick of telling your friends they were wrong all the time ? @entity71 : not necessarily my friends because i talk to them all the time			2
it could be as random as the coffee shop conversation while you 're waiting in line , those were the bits and pieces that would get under my skin			1
at least with my friends i could say , " guys , come on ! let me show you pictures			2
" and it was just this other ... you sit in a classroom and there is a limit to the amount of times you can correct people or even just if you are meeting someone for the first time , you 're not going to go into this tirade of why you believe that their perceptions were wrong			0
well what about @entity26 showcases the styles and influences from @entity1 , then ? @entity71 : i think it 's not necessarily @entity1 alone because i also lived in a couple of @entity11 countries , but i feel like general use of color , variation and also the presentation			1
also the fact that its made in @entity1 and i 'm using bits and pieces that are sourced locally			1
one of the things that i started doing , the sliders and the hooks for the soft tie bow ties , are made out of cow horn for my newest collect			0
cows are a big part of our culture here in terms of dowry and sustenance and history			0
@entity2 : style icons ? @entity71 : i 'd say @entity141			0
reading his story , it 's just fascinating and he 's also @entity11 , originated from @entity144			1
his unique use of color while intertwined with his personal experience and history with @entity150 tailoring -- he 's up there for my style icons			1
@entity2 : with you being a new startup , which designer label would you most like to emulate ? @entity71 : @entity155			0
they remain contemporary and release collections like every other designer but there is a strong sense of heritage and history there that i really admire			0
@entity2 : do you have a favorite piece from your latest collection ? @entity71 : i 've been figuring out how i can recreate the experience of going to your tailor and having something made for you and recently i partnered with a company called " @entity175 " based here in @entity1 and we 've been developing an app. there 's a special collection of bow ties i 'm making right now and what will happen , the box will have a qr code and when you scan the @entity183 you can see your bow tie being made			1
@entity2 : cool combination of combining tech to the label			0
@entity71 : it 's also bridging that gap between the customer and the person making the product in a way that i have n't really seen being done before			0
and for me that 's really amazing that half way across the world my customers would be able to see the working conditions , be able to almost have a personal connection with both the brand and the person that made the product			1
i think it will be really cool			0
@entity2 : so who 'd you most like to see wearing your designs on the red carpet ? @entity71 : celebrities who are bold			0
celebrities who are fearless and have a real sense of self			0
a few of the names that come to mind are ; @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223			0
@entity2 : right , last question : what advice would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs ? @entity71 : you have to take that leap of faith , if you feel so strongly about it then do it			0
i feel like if you feel strongly enough about something you will do it			0
it does n't matter if you 're an extravert , introvert , you will start something			0
