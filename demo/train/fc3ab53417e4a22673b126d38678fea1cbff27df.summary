@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 government blamed last friday 's rebel attack on an electric power station in downtown @entity7 on " armed terrorist gangs " -- the same epithet it has used to describe the protest movement that erupted in the southern border city of @entity12 more than a year ago			1
but the gunfire and explosions that echoed across the @entity4 capital in recent days have underscored a turning point of sorts			1
the clashes shattered the notion that @entity7 exists in a security bubble			1
helicopters said to fire indiscriminately @entity4 experts say the battle for @entity4 's two largest cities -- @entity7 and the country 's economic capital , @entity27 -- has begun			1
" in both places we 've seen not just more armed clashes than ever in the past , but also a revival of the protest movement in its peaceful dimension , " said @entity28 , a @entity7 - based analyst with the conflict - resolution organization @entity29			1
" what has changed is the conflict has moved into areas that the regime claimed was being dominated by the silent majority , which wanted stability , not regime change , " @entity28 added			0
that facade has been shattered in recent weeks , not by bullet or bombs , but through padlocks and keys			0
on monday , may 28 , row after row of shops and stalls in the cavernous @entity51 in the heart of @entity7 were shuttered			1
shopkeepers across the capital staged a general strike to protest against the suspected massacre of civilians in the village of @entity59 -- allegedly by pro-government militia			1
" when the merchants of @entity67 -- the main souq ( marketplace ) -- go on strike , you know you have lost the conscience and heart of @entity7 , " wrote @entity61 , a @entity4 expert and director of the @entity63 at the @entity64			1
" the @entity75 bourgeoisie has now turned on the regime			0
. " " this is really a very strong signal suggesting that the historical alliance between the regime and the business establishment in the capital is at least partially broken , " added @entity29 's @entity28			1
@entity28 pointed out that even during the height of the bloody @entity4 government crackdown against the @entity84 in 1982 , @entity85 , the father of the current @entity4 president , succeeded in preventing @entity7 merchants from staging strikes			1
several days after last month 's market strike in @entity7 , however , shopkeepers in several @entity27 commercial districts mounted a similar but smaller protest			1
" i did n't open my shop			0
all the @entity27 suburbs are on strike today ( after ) what happened in @entity59 , " an @entity27 shopkeeper who asked only to be named @entity96 , said in a phone interview with @entity2			1
" we carry the responsibility for continuing to work while people are dying , " @entity96 added			0
" that is our shame			0
" in some cases , @entity4 security forces lashed out at the silent commercial protest			1
one activist video showed men in camouflage uniforms using bolt cutters to force open the metal shutters of locked shops on a @entity7 street			1
the violence roiling the country , combined with sanctions imposed by @entity121 governments , has contributed to economic hardship faced by ordinary @entity4			1
more than a dozen residents of @entity7 and @entity27 interviewed by @entity2 complained of daily power outages and rising prices of commodities including sugar and cooking fuel			1
" they cut the electricity for two hours every morning , and of course it affects work a lot , because the whole company runs on computers , " said the ceo of a @entity7 - based media company , speaking to @entity2 on condition of anonymity for fear of his life			2
he said he had assigned one of his employees the task of purchasing diesel to run backup generators , but added that this was complicated by the recent spike in the price of fuel			0
" with the economic sanctions on the country , it is difficult for us to continue providing services because money transactions can not get through to us from our [ foreign ] clients , " the ceo said			2
" due to power outages , all the perishable food stocks in my refrigerators and freezers were ruined , " said @entity157 , a @entity7 shopkeeper who asked only to be identified by his first name to protect himself from reprisal			2
@entity157 told @entity2 he finally decided to shut down his business			0
" what 's the point of having a shop when nobody buys from you and people have no money to spend , and when they do they only spend it on the most basic needs ? " he asked			2
as economic conditions have worsened , the security presence in the two main cities has ramped up dramatically			2
a recent opposition video showed military trucks and hundreds of soldiers dressed in camouflage using the main sports stadium in @entity7 as an apparent staging ground			2
" it 's so different than when i was here six months ago , " reported @entity182 , a correspondent for @entity184 @entity183 , in a broadcast from @entity7 on saturday			1
" this was an alive city			0
people were out at night			0
they were in the cafes and in the restaurants			0
( now ) at night , the people go home and it 's time for the army to take over			2
" analysts argue that president @entity196 's regime 's decision to use overwhelming military force to try to crush opposition in second - tier cities like @entity200 has only spread the tentacles of the insurgency into cities that were once bastions of government support			2
@entity206 defined by indecision , violence " the regime has been sowing dragon 's teeth , " wrote @entity61 of the @entity64			0
" for every opponent of the regime killed , several more pop up to take its place			0
" " what we see is a regime whose narrative boiled down to ' us or chaos			0
' but increasingly what we see is ' them and chaos , " said @entity28 of the @entity29			0
" the regime has been incapable of imposing law and order			0
" the @entity4 regime is still far from defeated			2
it has fervent supporters and vastly better weapons than the rebels			0
but the image it successfully projected throughout much of the first 15 months of the uprising -- that of a government in control -- has begun to crack .			0
