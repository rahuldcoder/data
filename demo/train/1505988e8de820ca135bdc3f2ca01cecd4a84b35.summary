-- the @entity1 is vacating an air base in @entity3 at @entity5 's request following a @entity7 attack that killed two dozen @entity3 soldiers			1
@entity1 ambassador to @entity3 @entity10 told @entity3 's @entity11 on monday that the @entity1 is leaving @entity12 in @entity13 southwest of @entity14			1
@entity1 drones have taken off from the base and refueled there for operations against @entity20 militants , according to sources familiar with @entity1 drone operations in @entity3			1
the order to clear out of the base comes in the aftermath of a november 26 incident in which a @entity7 airstrike killed 24 @entity3 troops			1
according to two @entity1 officials familiar with an initial assessment of the incident , @entity1 commandos were working alongside @entity33 troops when they came under fire			1
the troops did not tell @entity3 authorities about the mission ahead of time because they had thought it would take place entirely within @entity33 , the officials said			1
@entity1 and @entity3 officials said friday there were conversations between the sides before the strike , but they differed on the content of those conversations			1
a @entity3 military spokesman said the attack hit the wrong target			2
a probe , headed by @entity1 air force brig			1
gen. @entity53 , is under way			0
the loss of the base is unlikely to have any major impact on operations in @entity3 , experts said			1
a @entity1 official said sunday that the " loss of access to this base would not lessen capabilities , as it has served primarily as a back - up capability for quite a while now			1
" the @entity1 flies drones out of @entity68 in nearby @entity33 , so the impact should not be enormous , said @entity0 national security analyst @entity70			2
still , there would be an impact , said @entity73 , who holds the @entity75 chair in @entity76 at the @entity77			0
" you 're talking potentially 40 to 60 minutes ' added reaction time , " he said			0
but the issue is broader than simply closing an airbase , @entity73 said			0
" it 's what @entity3 intends to do about its airspace , " he said			2
" if it 's saying , in addition to the base closing , that it will no longer cooperate to allow the @entity1 to use @entity3 airspace and there will be no cooperation on targeting and no quid pro quo where we would use systems to hit at insurgents or extremists which were threats to @entity3 as well as @entity33 , then it goes much further , " he said			1
" it also basically means that , if you 're going to do this , you 're clearly violating @entity3 airspace and , if you 're going to do it , you may have to rely much more on stealth			2
" international law is clear , he noted			0
" you ca n't , in theory , send an intelligence aircraft over somebody 's airspace			0
the fact that people do it all the time does n't make it legal			0
if you go beyond that , and the vehicle or airplane shoots something , that 's an act of war			0
" former @entity118 covert operations officer @entity117 said that , from a logistical point of view , closing the airbase is " irritating , inconvenient , concerning			0
" but , he added , " it wo n't impact our ability to strike at a target			0
" @entity117 , who is president of @entity126 , a global intelligence and security firm , described the base closure as " one more step down this dysfunctional road with the @entity3 , " but predicted that " cooperation between @entity118 and other intelligence portions of our military and the @entity3 " will continue			2
" regardless of what happens in the headlines , there is an operational level of activity that continues to move forward because , ultimately , it is in the @entity3 ' best interest to continue to try to counter some of the extremists ' activity			2
" high - level @entity3 officials have supported , quietly , the @entity1 drone campaign for years , he said			1
" they 've been playing the same game that any other nation will play -- they want a little bit of plausible deniability			0
" in other words , when public opinion turns against the drone attacks , the officials will turn against them , too , @entity117 said			0
" once they feel threatened from their own population because of their support and cooperation from the @entity1 , that 's when they 'll turn on us , " he said			2
" will they decide a drone strike in @entity3 airspace without permission is an act of war ? doubtful			0
" @entity1 officials have long prepared for @entity173 in @entity3 , he said			1
" if you have facilities in any country where you have a somewhat occasional volatile relationship , you 're always looking for alternatives , " he said			0
the issue of @entity1 and other @entity7 forces entering @entity3 has been a sensitive topic in that country since may , when @entity1 commandos killed @entity185 founder @entity184 in @entity186 without @entity3 leaders ' consent			1
@entity7 has called last month 's casualties " tragic			0
" @entity1 secretary of state @entity190 and defense secretary @entity191 called the incident a " tragedy " and offered condolences			0
president @entity195 called @entity3 's president sunday to express condolences over the airstrike			1
he said the incident was not a deliberate attack on @entity3 , the @entity199 said			0
the incident exacerbated already strained relations with @entity3			2
" such attacks ... demonstrate complete disregard for international law and human life , " @entity3 foreign minister @entity202 said the day after the attack			2
@entity202 asked the @entity1 to vacate the @entity12 within 15 days			1
the @entity1 @entity208 in @entity3 confirmed monday that @entity10 said the @entity1 is complying with the request			1
on monday , prime minister @entity210 said @entity3 wants to have good relations with the @entity1 based on mutual respect and clearly defined parameters			1
" i think that is doable , " he told state - run @entity214 of @entity3			2
" i think that it wo n't take long			0
" he said that new ties being negotiated with the @entity1 would ensure that the two countries " respected each other 's red lines " regarding sovereignty and rules of engagement along the border			2
" i think we have evolved some mechanisms , and we are ready to cooperate " on peace efforts in @entity33 , he said			0
in @entity232 , deputy @entity230 spokesman @entity229 , referring to the cross-border incident in which two dozen @entity3 soldiers were killed , said he welcomed @entity210 's remarks			1
" from the very moments after this tragedy , we 've been clear that this relationship is vital to @entity1 national security interests , it is vital to @entity3 's national security interests , it is vital to the region 's interests that we work together productively			1
and we are committed to addressing the issues between us and moving forward , " he told reporters			0
@entity0 's @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 and journalist @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
