in a major defeat for supporters of tougher gun laws , the @entity0 on wednesday defeated a compromise plan to expand background checks on firearms sales as well as a proposal to ban some semi-automatic weapons modeled after military assault weapons			1
the votes were on a series of amendments to a broad package of gun laws pushed by president @entity15 and @entity17 leaders in the aftermath of the @entity20 school massacre in december			1
however , fierce opposition by the powerful @entity22 led a backlash by conservative @entity24 and a few @entity17 from pro-gun states that doomed key proposals in the gun package , even after they had been watered down to try to satisfy opponents			2
after the votes , @entity15 angrily criticized the @entity22 and senators who voted against the expanded background checks for rejecting a compromise he said was supported by a strong majority of @entity34			1
public opinion gets trumped in gun control defeat " instead of supporting this compromise , the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill , " @entity15 told @entity39 reporters			1
noting polls that showed 90 % support for such a measure , @entity15 called it a " pretty shameful day for @entity48 " and wondered of @entity47 : " who are we here to represent ? " he was flanked by relatives of gun violence victims as well as former rep. @entity53 , a gun owner who was disabled in a shooting attack and supported @entity15 's proposals			1
a statement by @entity53 and her husband , former astronaut @entity58 , said the @entity0 had " ignored the will of the @entity34 people , " adding that those senators who voted against the expanded background checks chose to " obey the leaders of the powerful corporate gun lobby , instead of their constituents			1
" to @entity67 , the daughter of the principal of the @entity20 , @entity70 , school who was killed along with 20 first - graders and five other educators in the december attack , the vote amounted to inaction in the face of a national tragedy			0
" the next time there 's a mass shooting and they 're asked what they did to prevent it , they 're going to have to say nothing , " she said			0
on the other side , the @entity22 's @entity86 called the expanded background check proposal " misguided , " saying it would not reduce violent crime " or keep our kids safe in their schools			1
" the broader gun package still under consideration by the @entity0 includes tougher laws on gun trafficking and straw purchases , and steps to devise ways to improve safety in schools			2
@entity15 : ' this was a pretty shameful day in @entity48 ' as originally proposed , with a provision to expand background checks , it would have been the most significant gun legislation before @entity47 in almost two decades			1
due to early opposition to the background check provision , @entity17 sen. @entity108 of @entity109 and @entity110 sen. @entity110 of @entity111 worked out a compromise that was less comprehensive than what @entity15 wanted but still gained the president 's support			1
the @entity108 - @entity110 plan would have expanded background checks to include private sales at gun shows and all internet sales , while continuing to exempt most sales between family members and friends			1
due to procedural steps agreed to by both sides , all the amendments considered wednesday required 60 votes to pass in the 100 - member chamber , meaning @entity17 and their independent allies who hold 55 seats needed support from some @entity24 senators to push through the @entity108 - @entity110 proposal			0
the final vote was 54 in favor to 46 opposed with four republicans joining most @entity17 in supporting the compromise			0
with the outcome obvious , senate majority leader @entity139 , @entity140 , cast a " no " vote to secure the ability to bring the measure up again			0
meanwhile , four democrats from pro-gun states voted with most @entity24 in opposition			0
@entity53 on senators : ' shame on them ' when the result was announced by vice president @entity153 , who presided over the chamber for the vote , two women in the gallery of spectators shouted " shame on you " at the senators			0
" they are an embarrassment to this country that they do n't have any compassion or care for people who have been taken brutally from their families , " said one of them , @entity161 , who grabbed the gun magazine from the attacker who shot @entity53 and several other people in @entity166 in january 2011			0
on the proposal by @entity17 sen. @entity176 of @entity177 to update a 1994 ban on semi-automatic weapons that expired in 2004 , the vote was 40 - 60 , showing opposition by several @entity17 as well as the chamber 's @entity24 minority			0
@entity15 had pushed for @entity47 to include both the expanded background checks provision and the weapons ban in any gun package			1
in recent weeks , he and the @entity39 focused their efforts on winning support for the @entity108 - @entity110 compromise			0
however , the @entity22 promised political retribution against supporters of tougher gun laws , and it called the expanded background checks a first step toward a national gun registry and government confiscation of firearms			1
@entity15 called that claim misinformation , noting the @entity108 - @entity110 proposal prohibited such a registry			2
he said the tactics of the @entity22 galvanized a vocal minority of gun owners against the legislation , which caused some senators to flinch			2
@entity205 : @entity15 used @entity20 families as ' props ' " they worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as @entity213 , " @entity15 said			2
" and obviously a lot of @entity24 had that fear , but @entity17 had that fear , too			0
and so they caved to the pressure			0
and they started looking for an excuse , any excuse to vote ' no. ' " @entity139 earlier warned @entity24 that the strong majority of @entity34 who support expanded background checks wo n't forget votes against the @entity108 - @entity110 compromise			1
" the @entity34 people ... have a long , long memory , " he said			2
meanwhile , an alternative package of gun proposal that reflected the @entity22 position also was defeated			2
offerd by conservative @entity24 , the alternative plan introduced wednesday after weeks of hearings and debate on @entity17 proposals lacked any expansion of background checks but called for more funding to better enforce the existing system			1
emotions high as political world reacts a sponsor of the @entity24 alternative , sen. @entity241 of @entity242 , said it would target the gun violence problem in a way that the @entity17 proposal before the @entity0 would not			2
in response , @entity247 chairman sen. @entity246 , @entity248 , called the @entity24 's last - minute proposal a " weak and counterproductive alternative			0
" other proposed amendments defeated wednesday included a plan by @entity254 sen. @entity254 of @entity242 to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable throughout the country. , as well as a proposal by @entity17 sen. @entity259 of @entity260 to limit the number of rounds in ammunition magazines			0
any legislation passed by the @entity0 would then go to the @entity24 - led @entity39			0
so far , house speaker @entity265 has stopped short of promising a vote on whatever the @entity0 sends over			0
polls show that a strong majority of @entity34 support some type of initiative to stem gun violence			1
in a @entity274 / @entity273 poll released last week , 86 % of @entity34 say they support expanded background checks .			1
