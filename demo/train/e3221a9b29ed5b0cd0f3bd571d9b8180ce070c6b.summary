@entity0 -- a 26 - year - old man has been arrested in connection with the weekend vandalism of a painting by famed artist @entity7 at a @entity0 museum , @entity0 's @entity2 announced late monday			1
the man was arrested in @entity10 , on the southern coast of @entity12 , and will be brought to @entity0 on suspicion of criminal damage , a police statement said			1
the man was not named			2
the painting -- part of @entity7 's @entity17 mural series -- was hanging at @entity0 's @entity19 museum when a man began tagging the canvas with black paint sunday afternoon			1
museum - goer @entity23 , who witnessed the defacement and posted an image of it on @entity27 , told @entity1 he noticed a man walk into the exhibit and thought nothing of it until he heard a " smashing sound			1
" " it was very surreal			0
it was n't something we expected to see			0
one minute he sat down , and the next minute he put his foot over the barrier , " @entity23 said			0
he said he and his girlfriend saw the man as he finished up the tag and then made his getaway			2
they stayed at the exhibit while a group of nearby women went to find museum staff			2
an alarm soon went off , and the museum was evacuated			0
@entity23 said he and his girlfriend gave a description of the event to a museum employee			0
" it 's just not the thing you expect to see in an art gallery , " @entity23 said			0
" i 've never seen anything like it			0
it 's quite shocking , actually			0
" @entity7 , a @entity63 - @entity62 abstract expressionist , was commissioned to do a series of paintings for the @entity67 restaurant of the @entity17 building in @entity69 in 1958			1
though he started the series of murals , he famously reneged , deciding the swanky @entity69 restaurant was n't an appropriate home for his art. @entity7 rejected the commission but completed paintings stemming from the project , many of which made their way into the halls of museums			1
the murals arrived in @entity0 as @entity7 killed himself in 1970 and have been on display at many of the @entity86 's locations , as well as the @entity87 in @entity88			1
@entity7 's children , @entity90 and @entity91 , said in a statement that they were thankful for the support of others after the incident			1
" the @entity7 family is greatly troubled by yesterday 's occurrence but has full confidence that the @entity86 will do all in its power to remedy the situation , " the family said			2
" our father donated his legendary @entity17 paintings to the museum in 1969 sensing the commitment of the institution to his work and impressed by the warm embrace it had received from the @entity112 public			1
we are heartened to have felt that embrace again in the outpouring of distress and support that we and our father have received both directly and in public forums			0
" @entity1 's @entity117 and @entity118 contributed to this report .			0
