-- how eager are retailers to boost sales this holiday season ? it 's no longer enough for them to offer one special day of discounts to online shoppers -- they 're stretching the deals out over an entire week			1
while retailers are still trumpeting deals for this monday after @entity11 , many such as @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are now promoting some version of " @entity13 " and extending @entity15 - only deals through next weekend			1
the online discounts apply to all types of items , from appliances to clothes to consumer electronics			2
@entity9 , for example , says it will offer 200 deals on its website each day through friday , plus free shipping on all orders over $ 35			0
not to be outdone , @entity7 is promising new deals as often as every 10 minutes through saturday , along with free shipping on " eligible orders " of $ 35 and over ( it 's not clear how they define " eligible			0
" ) in fact , if you 're not getting free shipping on your online purchases this week , you may want to shop elsewhere			0
clothing chains such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 also are offering storewide cyber monday discounts of 40 %			1
it 's not always clear whether cyber monday discounts are much greater than what retailers offer online during other sale events			1
also , supplies may be limited			0
here 's a sampling of some online deals being advertised for @entity49 ( and in many cases , the rest of the week ) : -- @entity53 tablet with @entity54 of storage : $ 399 , down from $ 499 ( @entity7 ) -- @entity56 digital camera with 5x optical zoom ( red model only ) : $ 99 , down from $ 199 ( @entity8 ) -- @entity62 @entity61 smartphone : 1 cent ( it 's normally $ 199 ) , with two - year contract from @entity65 , @entity66 or @entity67 ( @entity7 ) -- 46 - inch @entity68 : $ 478 , marked down from $ 949 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity70 tablet : $ 119 , down from $ 169 ( @entity7 ) -- @entity72 rechargeable portable speaker : $ 69 , down from $ 199 ( @entity73 ) -- @entity75 15 - @entity76 15 - inch laptop : $ 459 , down from $ 649 ( @entity77 ) -- @entity79 smartphone : $ 349 without a contract , down from $ 499			2
the discount is available for all carriers and for both @entity54 and @entity84 models , although @entity85 says supplies will be limited			0
-- @entity87 : $ 399 , down from $ 549 ( @entity88 ) -- @entity90 192 - piece mechanics tool set : $ 99 , down from $ 199 ( @entity91 ) -- select coats from @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 : 50 % off , plus free shipping on online purchases of $ 75 or more ( @entity99 ) -- half off select men 's and women 's clothes and accessories ( @entity8 ) the term @entity49 was coined in 2005 by a division of the @entity106 with the thinking that shoppers , after browsing in stores over @entity11 weekend , would wait to make online purchases monday from their offices , where they had faster internet connections			1
that notion is somewhat outdated now because 70 % of @entity114 have high - speed broadband internet service at home , not to mention on their phones and tablets			0
but since 2010 , cyber monday actually has been the biggest online - shopping day of the year -- and retailers are trying to capitalize .			2

retailers offering cyber monday deals of up to 50 % on electronics and other items
many websites now offer discounts throughout what they call " @entity13 "
the term @entity49 was coined in 2005 by a retail *lobbying* group
