-- @entity1 has vowed to act on revelations of worldwide match - fixing , but its top security official warns that the governing body will need help from outside football to eradicate the problem			1
monday 's report from @entity10 said that 380 matches across @entity12 had been fixed by an @entity14 - based crime syndicate , including @entity15 and @entity17 qualifiers as well as the continent 's top club competitions			1
" the cooperation between law enforcement and sporting organizations needs to be strengthened , " @entity1 's director of security @entity20 said in a statement			1
" the support of law enforcement bodies , legal investigations , and ultimately tougher sanctions are required , as currently there is low risk and high gain potential for the fixers			1
" @entity1 already works closely with @entity34 , the worldwide police agency , while its @entity36 counterpart said there had so far been 50 people arrested in 15 countries in an investigation involving 425 match officials , club officials , players and criminals			2
it is estimated that â ‚ ¬ 16 million ( $ 21.7m ) had been bet on matches by criminals , yielding an â ‚ ¬ 8 million ( $ 10.8m ) profit , with the highest single bribe of â ‚ ¬ 140,000 paid in @entity51			0
" match - fixing and match manipulation is a global problem , and one that is not going to go away tomorrow , " @entity20 said			1
" @entity1 and the football community are committed to tackling this problem , but we will not succeed alone			2
" @entity20 , a former @entity34 director and @entity59 federal criminal police office manager , said governments need to take a tougher stance on people involved in match - fixing			1
" in football , a national association can sanction a member of the football family if they are found guilty of contravening the legal , football framework , " he said			0
" @entity1 's @entity69 provides the opportunity to extend those sanctions , and impose a life ban			2
" but for people outside of football , currently the custodial sentences imposed are too weak , and offer little to deter someone from getting involved in match - fixing			1
" @entity1 requests that law enforcement bodies continue their engagement , and continue to assist @entity1 in the global fight against match - manipulation and organized criminals , even if the investigations are considered complex			1
" @entity1 president @entity84 has also recently called for greater government intervention in match - fixing cases			1
" it is time for governments to introduce appropriate sanctions as a deterrent , for while a player may be prepared to risk a ban for throwing a match , he will most likely not wish to risk a prison sentence , " he said on the @entity1 website			1
" we must lobby governments to introduce legislation of this kind , both nationally and across borders where possible , through countries reaching a common position on this problem			0
" reports have claimed that one of the @entity12 matches in question was a @entity110 match between @entity112 club @entity111 and @entity114 's @entity113			1
however , the @entity116 side said tuesday that it had not been contacted by the authorities about the 2009 match , and the @entity119 also denied any knowledge of fixing at that game			2
" @entity111 has not been contacted by anyone from @entity10 or @entity110 in relation to this matter , " the five - time @entity12 champion told @entity0			2
" the @entity119 is not aware of any credible reports into suspicious @entity110 fixtures in @entity112 , nor has any information been shared with us , " a spokesman told @entity0			0
" while the @entity110 comes under @entity110 jurisdiction , the @entity119 , alongside the @entity116 , @entity132 and @entity133 , monitor markets for the top seven leagues and three major cup competitions in @entity112 and take matters of integrity in football extremely seriously			0
" in 2010 , @entity110 banned @entity113 goalkeeper @entity140 for two years for failing to report that he was approached to fix matches by a betting syndicate before a match against @entity144 in october the previous year			1
the club confirmed that the @entity111 and @entity144 matches were being investigated , but refused to comment further on the accusations			2
" neither @entity148 or the player wants to react to this news			0
everything on this matter has been dealt with in 2010 , " its website reported			0
former @entity1 security chief @entity154 told @entity155 that investigations need to be more proactive			1
" this is very easy cash money for organized crime and i think governments should be worried about it , " said the @entity157 , who now works for @entity160 - based sports security consultancy @entity159			2
" this is typical organized crime behavior : attract people , corrupt people and finally intimidate them			0
" i think police have finally realized that this is organized crime and therefore they have an interest			0
most of these investigations in @entity12 happened accidentally			0
they were investigating crime in other areas and came across this issue of match - fixing			1
" there 's been no determined effort to have preventative investigation , it 's been retrospective			0
we need to find out who 's involved and stop them -- in fact , to prevent them			0
" a former player who helped expose match - fixing in @entity189 in 2011 says clubs also need to take more responsibility			1
" the management of the clubs have to act and support the players and support the authorities in their investigations , " said @entity192 , who now works as a community coach for @entity112 club @entity194			0
" they can not leave the players isolated and afraid to speak out when they are confronted by the wrong individuals , " he told the @entity116 team 's website			0
@entity192 was recognized by @entity34 after telling the authorities he had been offered a bribe to fix the outcome of an @entity208 game in november 2011 , and was later called up to @entity189 's national team as a reward			0
" working now with children , i understand completely how important it is to pass on the right values , " he said .			0
