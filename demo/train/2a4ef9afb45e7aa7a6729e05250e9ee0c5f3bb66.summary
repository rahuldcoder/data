by its own admission , the @entity2 government 's policy on asylum seekers has been overwhelmed , just three months after the passing of new laws aimed at stemming the flow of those seeking refuge in @entity2			1
since the resurrection of the so - called " @entity12 , " under which asylum seekers making their way to @entity2 by boat are processed offshore , 7,929 people have arrived in @entity2 waters on 134 boats , according to the @entity18			1
@entity2 immigration minister @entity19 said wednesday that detention facilities on @entity21 in @entity22 and @entity23 would not be able to accommodate all the asylum seekers who had recently arrived and said that " some of these people will be processed in the @entity2 community			1
" at full capacity , @entity23 and @entity21 are able to accommodate 2,100 asylum seekers , around a third of the number who have arrived since august 13 when the government announced a return to the policy introduced by the @entity36 government led by @entity37 in 2001			1
the decision to process the overload of asylum seekers on the @entity2 mainland comes as @entity42 inspectors this week described conditions at the @entity23 detention center , where 387 asylum seekers are currently held , as " appalling			1
" @entity42 said conditions were so bad that there had been a " terrible spiral " of self - harm , hunger strikes and suicide attempts as people waited to be processed			2
one of several people on a hunger strike at the facility had not eaten for more than 40 days , the group said			0
the center on @entity23 re-opened in august this year			0
" in summer , in the heat , it gets to over 40 degrees during the day in those tents and it was certainly very hot and humid when we were in there			0
when it 's raining , as it is now , the tents are leaking and their bedding gets wet at night , '' @entity42 's @entity63 told reporters during a visit to the island			0
the government has dismissed the criticism			0
" conditions on @entity23 at times may not be pleasant but they are the same conditions immigration staff and service providers are working under , " immigration minister @entity19 said			1
foreign minister senator @entity76 insisted wednesday that despite the extraordinarily large number of arrivals , the re-opening of the @entity23 facility had deterred people from making the journey			0
nor did he think that @entity42 's observations had damaged @entity2 's reputation			2
" i think @entity2 stands out in the world as having a humane commitment that i 'm very proud of , that all @entity2 can be very proud of , " he told the @entity85			2
but for @entity89 , the ceo and founder of @entity91 , a not for profit support group for refugees and asylum seekers , @entity2 's mandatory detention laws are little more than an illegal form of " house arrest			1
" @entity89 , who spent three years in both onshore and offshore processing centers between 2011 and 2004 after fleeing @entity98 , said , based on his experience , asylum seekers kept in detention were poorly treated and their complaints ignored			1
" offshore processing centers may lower the number of asylum seekers in @entity2 , but it is not a viable solution to fairly deal with asylum seekers and it will not put a stop to people coming to this country by boat , " he told @entity103			1
but as the first group of 19 asylum seekers , or " irregular maritime arrivals " as the government calls them , were transferred from @entity2 territory to @entity21 , the immigration minister issued a now familiar warning to those attempting the perilous sea journey to @entity2			1
" to those contemplating the dangerous journey to @entity2 by boat : people smugglers are lying to you , do n't waste your money and do n't risk your life -- it 's just not worth it , " he in a media release			2
' there is no visa on arrival , there will be no special treatment , no speedy outcome and certainly no advantage given to those who come by boat			0
" those who can not be accommodated on @entity21 or @entity23 would be processed onshore , @entity19 said			0
bridging visas would be granted but asylum seekers would not have the right to work and would receive only minimal accommodation assistance			2
they will still be subject to the " no advantage " rule , just like those who were sent offshore for processing , he added			0
the government also announced wednesday that 100 @entity98 men had been involuntarily returned to their homeland -- the ninth and largest involuntary removal to date			0
the immigration minister said when the men were advised that they were subject to removal from @entity2 , they raised no issues " that engaged @entity2 's international obligations " : they were not considered nor considered themselves to be refugees			1
@entity98 have been returned to @entity162 since the @entity12 came into effect			0
some chose to return to @entity98 voluntarily , rather than transfer from the @entity2 mainland to @entity23			2
@entity89 believes the men recently deported may have preferred to return to @entity98			0
" if people choose to go back where they were persecuted over @entity23 , ( this ) means that they are ready die rather ( than ) getting rotten somewhere , not able to seek freedom , " he told @entity103			0
" it is not a win for the @entity2 government and the government must be ashamed for creating a rigid refugee policy which persecutes asylum seekers once again , " he added			1
for @entity89 , the @entity2 government has blood on its hands			2
for @entity42 , it will come as no surprise that @entity98 are opting to return home or putting up little resistance			0
the human rights group noted after its inspection of @entity23 , that asylum seekers believed they were being sent to the island state to be " driven crazy " and would prefer to return home .			1
