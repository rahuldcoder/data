-- there are less than five months to go until the @entity2 begins in @entity3 but the clock is ticking for another of the global football fiesta 's host cities			1
@entity8 , the capital of the southern state of @entity11 , is so behind with its stadium renovations that @entity13 could strip it of its host status			1
on a trip to inspect the venue tuesday , @entity16 , secretary general of the sport 's governing body , told reporters : " you can not organize games if you do not have a stadium -- that 's obvious			0

so that 's why again there is this emergency situation			2
" @entity13 has now given builders in the city of @entity8 a new deadline of february 18 to show a marked improvement in the stadium			1
the @entity38 venue , home to @entity40 , is being expanded for the @entity2 with new seats added alongside the pitch and capacity raised to 40,000			2
it is understood to now be 90 % complete but has progressed little since the end of november , when it was 88 % done			0
work on the stadium was also halted in october when a local judge intervened because of concerns that workers were at serious risk of being injured			0
" we are not expecting the stadium to be ready on february 18 , " @entity16 continued			2
" what we are expecting is to see a progress and to understand where we are going and that is what is being put in place today			0
" @entity61 , executive secretary of @entity3 's @entity62 , agreed with @entity16 's criticism , saying : " if the pace of work at the stadium in @entity8 were to be kept as it is , then it would not be ready to host the @entity2			1
" with this is mind , we agreed that we would take steps to guarantee that the arena would be ready to host the games scheduled to be held there			0
" those steps include " scaling up " work on the stadium and an injection of an extra $ 16.5 million from the @entity11 government 's development fund			1
@entity2 holder @entity79 is due to play the first match at the stadium against @entity83 on june 26			0
a total of 12 venues scattered throughout @entity3 are due to host @entity2 games this summer but many of them have been beset with problems			1
five workers have died on @entity2 stadium construction sites , the latest the death of @entity93 , who fell from the roof of a stadium in the @entity97 city of @entity98 in december			2
many of the stadiums are behind with their construction deadlines and there have been concerns that @entity3 's transport network could create major logistical problems			1
preparations for the @entity2 have also been controversial in @entity3			2
protesters are outraged at what they consider lavish spending on the @entity2 as well as the 2016 @entity110			0
@entity3 has not hosted the @entity2 since 1950 -- when it lost 2 - 1 in the deciding match to @entity112			0
