-- the technology industry often finds itself pontificating about the future , but the busy news cycle this year gave us plenty to discuss			1
very influential tech pioneers died ; cyber-security cost companies billions of dollars ; and trends in electronics and on the @entity11 provided new tools and created new challenges			1
smartphones and tablets each grew so immensely this year that we decided to give them their own mobile year - in - review list			1
as for future talk , there were plenty of bold , futuristic initiatives that did not quite bear fruit this year			1
the seeds of @entity34 's mobile strategy , @entity24 's plans for @entity26 post-acquisition , @entity29 's @entity28 silicon transistors and mobile payment systems like @entity31 were planted this year			1
but those stories were left off of this list because their products did not reach a mass market in 2011			1
look for those to make big splashes in 2012			1
these 10 stories in 2011 had a huge impact that could resonate for many years : 1			1
@entity43 dies from humble middle - class roots to running the most valuable tech company in the world , @entity44 co-founder @entity43 was powerful and revered			1

he also found time to lead @entity70 , the " @entity73 " creator that the @entity72 paid $ 7.4 billion to acquire in 2006			2
the fast - paced tech industry halted for a moment after @entity43 ' death this year , prompting business and world leaders to speak publicly about his impact			1
it may never be the same after			2

use of social networks to spread the word about demonstrations persisted this year , especially in the @entity98 uprising that toppled longtime president @entity99			1
in @entity102 , participants in riots used @entity103			2
@entity104 reports from @entity105 and other @entity107 protests frequently popped up on @entity87			2
perhaps in a nod to those events , @entity86 ceo @entity108 said onstage at his conference this year , " we exist at the intersection of technology and social issues			1
hackers the @entity118 mask , a stark white symbol of political upheaval , can be seen at many occupy protests , but the accessory from the movie " @entity123 " was adopted earlier by an online group called @entity126			2
members of the loosely organized group emerged from the @entity130 underground this year with a series of politically fueled computer attacks on churches , e-commerce and banks			2

@entity24 , with its @entity166 tablets , and @entity167 , with the @entity168 , were not pleased with the answer			0
@entity170 may have cracked the formula with its $ 199 @entity172			0

@entity86 and partners add ' frictionless ' sharing what do you call it when someone you know finds out something about you without you telling them ? @entity86 calls it " frictionless , " and companies that have implemented the feature , including some music - streaming services and news publishers , have found a great promotional vehicle			1

over the next decade , he orchestrated a masterful turnaround that culminated in @entity44 briefly becoming the world 's most valuable company by market capitalization			1

@entity260 's @entity259 beats human champs on ' @entity262 ! ' at times , the @entity259 computer , built by @entity260 , failed to understand some nuances of the @entity266 language , prompting mocking laughter			0
