-- modern @entity2 presidents seem to be in need of neat , catchy labels for the enemy they want to destroy			1
" network of death " is the latest one			0
after @entity2 president @entity12 's speech at the @entity13 , we now know that it is this network that needs " dismantling			1
" whether or not this new label will help increase the number of countries willing to join the @entity2 in the fight against @entity20 remains to be seen			1
@entity22 , trusted allies will doubtless follow			0
@entity24 's prime minister @entity23 has already vowed that his country will " play its part			2
" all @entity23 needs is parliamentary approval , which is expected friday -- and maybe his own new label for @entity20			1
but how will the " network " react ? how will it strike back ? it is of course difficult to see how @entity20 could successfully resist @entity2 air power in the long run			1
yet this conflict is first and foremost a political confrontation			0
the many wars in the @entity38 since 9/11 have shown that messages matter			0
and in this regard the @entity41 is bound to continue to do just fine			0
this is not so much because @entity20 and its supporters have created media arms like those radical @entity47 groups @entity45 or @entity48			1
nor has it much to do with the ability to spread their videos by using @entity53 - bots or multiple @entity55 accounts , clever hashtags , mobile phone apps or more obscure social media sites to evade counter-measures by police and security agencies			0
it has all to do with the message itself			0
if it resonates , it will spread			0
goaded into action ? @entity20 has already portrayed the mere fact that @entity12 has decided to use military force as a success			1
groups like @entity20 crave recognition			1
acknowledging them as a major threat -- and taking counter-measures -- does just that			2
it guarantees extensive coverage in traditional media			0
@entity20 ' first reaction after the start of the bombardments was to point out that @entity12 , like @entity80 before him , was drawn into a conflict that he could not win			1
@entity20 got what it wanted -- a direct confrontation with the @entity2 and an opportunity to link @entity12 to the widely discredited military strategy of his successor			1
provoking and unsettling is a major part of @entity20 media strategy			1
the group knows @entity92 audiences as well as local and regional ones			0
hostages are shown in the familiar @entity96 - style orange jump suits : " what you did to us , we can do to you , " is the simple message			0
not new , but tried , tested and successful , particularly with local audiences			0
recruiting @entity92 muslims most unsettling to @entity92 audiences is that disaffected @entity101 from their own nations are drawn to join the conflict			1
it is hardly necessary for the @entity20 leadership to threaten retaliation in @entity92 countries			2
a few more posts , pictures or videos featuring @entity20 fighters with @entity115 , @entity24 or @entity116 voices are sufficient to scare @entity92 politicians and their respective electorates			2
they might even provoke counter-measures like stricter border controls , passport restrictions and increased surveillance			0
they might also lead to new types of profiling , which may well backfire and encourage yet more young men to travel to @entity128 to take up the fight for the self - proclaimed @entity130 , as @entity20 has proclaimed itself to be			2
@entity92 counter-messages and social media offences will hardly prevent this			0
so in essence , it is as simple as to keep doing what @entity20 media people are already doing			1
merely resisting @entity2 military pressure as long as possible will strengthen @entity20 's message			1
as will the potentially devastating consequences of @entity2 , @entity115 or @entity24 bombing raids on civilian populations			2
adding variety adding a few videos of successful @entity20 attacks or evidence of dogged resistance will also help			2
hostage videos alone will lose their impact over time , however gruesome they are			0
a little variation is needed			0
the new " lecture series " of @entity24 hostage @entity153 shows that @entity20 is aware of that			2
whether @entity12 's " network of death " is the appropriate phrase or not , it is certainly true that @entity20 and affiliates form a network			1
but even if @entity20 were to become seriously " degraded , " it is difficult to believe that the whole network can be dismantled			2
at the heart of the current turmoil in the @entity38 is a civil war within @entity47			0
being regarded as the one force that stands up to @entity2 and @entity92 military power is bound to boost @entity20 's reputation in this struggle			1
the media prominence @entity20 has achieved is also bound to encourage other groups to embark on similar " media work			1
" the " network of death " is in an excellent position to continue to create @entity20 - style media messages			1
the video of the beheading of @entity115 mountain guide @entity179 , posted by the @entity182 @entity20 affiliate on wednesday , is only the most recent example .			0

@entity20 has goaded @entity2 president @entity12 into reacting , **writes** @entity185
he says terror groups crave attention -- and @entity12 's giving them that
provoking and unsettling is a major part of @entity20 media strategy , @entity185 **writes**
media message could attract disaffected @entity101 from @entity196 , he says
