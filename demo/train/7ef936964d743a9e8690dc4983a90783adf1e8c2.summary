@entity64 , @entity6 attorney for the @entity65 , noted to reporters in @entity67 , @entity68 , that covert efforts had not resulted in any arrests , and said officials decided it was in the best interests of the investigation to unseal the case and enlist the assistance of the public in the @entity6 and @entity15			1
toward that end , @entity77 , @entity78 special agent in charge , @entity80 , said the @entity78 was offering up to $ 250,000 per fugitive for information leading to their arrest			1

launched by the @entity146 , the operation was intended to track weapons purchases by @entity15 drug cartels			1
however , the operation lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border , and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of @entity5 's killing			0
@entity64 alluded to the controversy that has swirled around the case , which has provided ample fodder for am - radio talk - show hosts , noting that " there are almost unprecedented atmospherics that have surrounded this case			0

" @entity20 voted june 28 to hold @entity18 in contempt for refusing to hand over documents related to the program			0
poll : @entity6 ' views on contempt vote republicans said that was because he was not fully compliant with a @entity17 subpoena requesting the documents ; democrats and the @entity187 countered that the documents withheld were internal deliberations that have , by tradition , been kept private during past administrations of both parties			0
" agent @entity5 served his country honorably and made the ultimate sacrifice in trying to protect it from harm , and we will stop at nothing to bring those responsible for his murder to justice , " @entity18 said			1
