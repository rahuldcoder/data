@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's funeral was to be a private affair , with family and friends gathering at a catholic church to mourn the 20 - year - old @entity9 who died a hero in @entity11 , serving his country			1
but @entity14 's father says his grief was compounded by anger and helplessness because of about a dozen unwanted visitors , a fringe group standing at the center of a constitutional showdown			1
" i was just shocked that any individual could do this to another human being , " @entity22 told @entity2			0
" i mean , it was inhuman			0
" he speaks of members of a small @entity29 church who have gained nationwide attention for protesting loudly at funerals of @entity34 service members , denouncing homosexuality			1
both sides will now receive a @entity38 hearing over their competing constitutional rights			1
oral arguments are wednesday morning , with a final ruling some months away			0
at issue is a balancing test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free speech and religious expression rights of demonstrators , however disturbing and provocative their message			1
several states have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the protests are conducted			0
here , venue and context will be key to the justices ' decision -- whether funerals warrant a greater zone of privacy , and whether the " speech " in this case was specifically aimed at a private citizens like the @entity4 family			1
' everyone deserves to be buried with dignity ' @entity69 always wanted to be a solider , his father said			2
his son enlisted just after high school , he said , and enjoyed the military life : " i think @entity14 wanted to be in a job where he could help people and serve that purpose			2
" the young lance corporal died from a noncombat - related vehicle accident in @entity11 's @entity79 on march 3 , 2006			1
@entity22 called it the worst day of his life			0
the funeral was held at @entity83 in this northern @entity1 town			0
two days before , members of the @entity86 had advertised its intent to appear and picket			1
that prompted a heavy police presence at the march 10 funeral , including a command center and swat team			0
@entity86 members were confined to a pre-assigned space along a public road , some distance from the church building			1
the funeral procession was rerouted to avoid driving directly past the protesters			0
the hecklers carried signs that varied from the general to the personal : " @entity86 , " @entity104 , " but also " you 're going to @entity106 , " and " @entity107 hates you , " which the @entity4 family claimed was directed at their son , who was not gay			1
the church patriarch @entity112 led the protest			2
" that 's what i preach			0
they 're either fags or f --- ing enablers			0
take your choice , each one is going to hell			0
" another church member said , " we 're here to tell them that they sent their son to hell			2
" there were no direct confrontations and no arrests of the church members			2
@entity22 then sued , claiming defamation and invasion of privacy			2
he says he became violently ill when he saw an online " manifesto " the @entity86 posted after that protest			1
in it , the @entity137 family said @entity22 and his wife raised @entity4 " for the devil " and that " @entity107 killed @entity4 so his servants would have an opportunity to preach his words " at other venues across @entity1			0
" they are very sick individuals , " said @entity4			0
" it comes down to dignity			0
no one should be buried with what the @entity137 did			0
everyone deserves to be buried with dignity			0
" a jury agreed and awarded @entity4 's family $ 2.9 million in compensatory damages , plus $ 8 million in punitive damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress , and intrusion upon seclusion , among other finding			0
those total damages were later reduced to $ 5 million			0
it was the nation 's first civil suit against the church over the protests			2
@entity22 testified he suffered severe physical and emotional distress , but church members argued their broader message was aimed at the unspecified actions of the military and those who serve in it			1
a federal appeals court agreed , concluding the signs and shouts did not directly refer to the lance corporal , and were therefore protected speech on issues of national debate			1
that court called the @entity29 church 's actions " rhetorical hyperbole			1
" now the @entity38 is poised to offer the final word			1
founder 's daughter dismisses effort to silence church @entity86 is a mostly family affair , with the @entity137 family making up most of the 75 or so congregants			1
they own a compound of houses in @entity194 , @entity29 , where they live and conduct services			0
the pastor has 13 children , at least 54 grandchildren and seven great - grandchildren			0
he described himself as an " old - time " gospel preacher in a @entity2 interview in 2006 , saying , " you ca n't preach the @entity204 without preaching the hatred of @entity107			0
" the church , founded in 1955 and led by @entity137 , is not affiliated with any known baptist associations but has been officially registered as a religious institution			2
its members believe @entity107 is punishing the @entity34 for " the sin of homosexuality , " through events including soldiers ' deaths			1
members have traveled the country hundreds of times , shouting their unique message			2
before they began protesting the funerals of soldiers , church members brought their colorful " @entity107 hates fags " signs to the funerals of gay men who died of @entity227 or @entity227 - related illnesses			1
church members also picketed the funeral of @entity231 , the victim of an anti-gay beating and one of those for whom the @entity231 and @entity236 @entity235 was named			1
they also show up at football games , music concerts , @entity240 institutions , the @entity241 in @entity242 , state legislatures and courthouses			0
they plan to picket outside the @entity38 at wednesday 's oral arguments in the dispute			1
@entity86 leaders openly admit they seek to shock and provoke with their message			1
" @entity86 's speech is in a format showing it is religious commentary , " said church members in their brief to the @entity38			1
" @entity86 's speech was public - issue speech , highly disliked , and needing protection			1
a massive public discussion is under way in this nation -- about the wars ; the soldiers ; their deaths ; and their funerals			1
everyone is using the occasion of soldiers ' deaths to comment , about the policies of this nation			2
" @entity269 , daughter of the church 's founder and a leader of the group , dismissed @entity4 's efforts to silence the church			2
" i do n't care what they want to , " she said in a 2006 @entity2 interview			0
" what they want to do is litigate our religious doctrine			0
well , you do n't do that in @entity34			1
" free speech or harassment ? the @entity38 has never addressed the specific issue of laws designed to protect the " sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services " as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased			1
but the high court has recognized the state 's interest in protecting people from unwanted protests or communications while in their homes			1
in a larger context , the justices will be asked to address how far states and private entities such as cemeteries and churches can go to justify picket - free zones and the use of " floating buffers " to silence or restrict the speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting			2
various jurisdictions across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the @entity86 church protesters			1
in a separate appeal , the high court last year temporarily blocked @entity325 's effort to enforce a specific law aimed at the church			1
@entity137 , his daughter @entity269 and other church members had protested near the august 2005 funeral of an @entity333 soldier in @entity334 , @entity325			2
state lawmakers later passed the " spc. @entity336 , " criminalizing picketing " in front or about " a funeral location or procession			0
that issue could reach the @entity38 in the next year or two			1
@entity4 's attorney , @entity341 , says there would be no constitutional quandary if the @entity137 picketed the state capitol or in a public park			0
but he says this is different			0
" when they protest outside a private funeral , they 're not trying to advocate for or against a particular position , " he told @entity2			0
" all they 're doing is harassing a family so they can hijack someone else 's private event			0
" the grieving father remains angry at the @entity137 and said he is determined to continue the fight			2
" they are using the @entity359 as a sword and a shield			0
my son and thousands like him did not put their lives on the line so that someone could abuse the @entity368 like this , " he said			0
" men and women have died for this right and to have it abused and spit on -- it 's not free speech			1
this fight has never been about free speech to me , it 's about harassment			2
" @entity2 's @entity380 contributed to this report .			0
