@entity1 begs to be taken to a hospital			1
the chilling scene was captured on video by a local television cameraman and broadcast across @entity3 's networks			1

it tells the whole story			0
" @entity1 , age 17 and dressed in a dark shirt and jeans , tried to rob people at a fairly new park named in honor of slain former prime minister @entity53 , police say			1
@entity55 police official @entity54 said @entity1 pointed a pistol and wanted to steal cash and cell phones			1
@entity1 's gun was confiscated and he was handed over to park security and then to the @entity61 , police say			1
