-- style - maker , tv host and opinionated fashionista @entity1 explains how to give yourself a complete makeover -- inside and out			1
style - maker @entity1 spills the naked truth on giving yourself a mental makeover			1
minimize the negative as @entity12 said , " @entity10 is architecture : it 's a matter of proportions			0
" in other words : no matter which part of your body you dislike , there 's a clever way to divert the eye elsewhere			2
try different styles and employ horizontal ( widening ) , vertical ( elongating ) and diagonal ( slimming ) lines as necessary			2
venture out of your comfort zone " many women get used to dressing their body a certain way because they think it 's the only thing that works for them , " says @entity1			1
find a boutique or department store with well - trained salespeople and try on three styles you 've never worn			1
it might be a fabric such as jersey that you 've always deemed too clingy or an empire - waist camisole that you 're convinced looks too young			2
not every experiment will be a success , but even one new style or color will prove that there are more ways than you thought to look your best			0
do n't be ruled by your insecurities if you 've been avoiding the beach or missing out on parties because you 're afraid of being the largest person there , grab a friend and go to the very place that incites terror -- just be sure you 're wearing an amazing outfit			2
avoid a blackout " have you ever seen a happy goth ? " muses @entity1			1
" i think everyone needs color to feel good			2
" too many women rely on head - to - toe black as a form of camouflage			1
but any hue can be slimming if worn monochromatically -- so instead of black , reach for plum , gray or chocolate brown			0
clean out your closet whether you 're holding on to clothes that are too small because you hope you 'll fit into them someday , or clothes that are too big for fear you 'll grow back into them , you 're keeping past wounds open			0
" old clothes stop you from living in the present , " says @entity1			1
" they reinforce what you used to look like			0
" get rid of anything you have n't worn in two years and replace it with something new that makes you feel pretty			1
and while you 're out shopping , have a house - cleaner swing by for good measure			1
write yourself a love note some women are so obsessed with their hips that they fail to notice their flat tummy			0
remind yourself of your virtues by writing a note that says something like " hey , you have a great chest ! " tack it to the bathroom mirror so you 'll see it in the morning and before bedtime			0
" we 're so trained to look for the negative that we need a physical reminder of the positive , " explains @entity1			1
have a princess moment treating yourself to a massage , a body exfoliation , a professional blow - out , a brow shaping or a mani - pedi can elevate your mood by affirming to yourself that you 're worth the splurge			2
get naked some women on @entity1 's show are so self - conscious about their bodies that they 're reluctant to be naked around their husbands			1
that discomfort affects how they feel when dressed too			0
before you can move as if you own the room , you 'll have to be at ease inside your skin , and spending time in the buff can help			0
one idea : take a bath with the ( gasp ! ) lights on -- no candles			0
" feeling comfortable with your body alone is the first step to feeling comfortable with your body around others , " says @entity1			1
if all else fails , fake it one of @entity1 's favorite mantras is " looking cute is feeling cute			2
" so if you 're having a low day , force yourself to go through the motions			0
put on your makeup , do your hair , wear a great outfit			0
sometimes faking it can give you enough of a boost to lift you out of the doldrums			0
" feeling pretty , " @entity1 says , " changes your whole outlook because you feel good about yourself			1
