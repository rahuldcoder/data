anyone stuck reading this while waiting for a delayed flight should take note : next time fly via @entity5			1

it 's a figure that might discomfit officials at the main airports serving @entity27 -- including @entity15 's busiest at @entity28 ( 75.5 % ) -- none of which made the top rankings , with the exception of @entity33			1
that puts it top of the league not only for small airports , but also larger facilities			2
@entity39 , @entity23 executive vice president , says the findings of his company 's first annual " @entity41 " were positive , although many leading operators would probably be looking to up their game in 2015			2

the most punctual large air hub was named as @entity64 ( 89 % ) -- a fact that 'll do little to dispel stereotypes of @entity68 efficiency , but one that also highlights the five - year delay to @entity56 's still unopened @entity70			2
@entity64 was followed by @entity71 at 87.9 % and @entity73 's @entity72 at 86.2 %			0
the world 's busiest air destination , @entity76 , was ranked 12th on the large airports list with a score of 82.4 %			0
