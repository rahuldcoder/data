first light creeps over @entity1 as i climb groggily into a @entity3 and head out for an early morning game drive			1
on any other @entity7 safari you would expect to hear the roar of a diesel engine as the hulking vehicle shudders into gear , breaking the stillness of dawn			2
but on this morning , our guide @entity16 starts the @entity17 and we glide silently away from the lodge , off to see elephants and lions in an almost zen - like quietness			1
i 've been to wildlife reserves all over @entity23 but this , for me , is a first			1
not only is it kinder to the environment , but -- as i discovered during my stay at @entity29 -- a far better way to see wild animals			1
in the lodge 's converted electric @entity3 , silent and smooth , we hear every bird , every rustle of the bush			1
@entity16 stops so we can take photos of the brilliant orange sunrise ; we then continue quietly along , listening to the alarm calls of baboons and the chatter of guinea fowl descending from their roost			2
such an experience is a rare thing indeed			0
@entity46 , located inside the national park on @entity49 's northern border with @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , launched what it describes as the world 's first electric safari fleet in late november			1
the lodge is rolling out both electric game drive vehicles -- retrofitted @entity3 -- and electric boats , for game - viewing cruises along the @entity60			1
huge elephant population the power supply comes from the hydroelectric grid supplied by southern @entity23 's mighty @entity64			1
@entity1 's fleet is being converted to electricity by a @entity23 - based firm called @entity68			1
the lodge 's general manager hit on the idea after reading an article about the company 's work			1
@entity76 @entity75 , a @entity68 co-owner , says electric vehicles are well suited to game viewing , and " just so kind to our environment			1
" the converted @entity3 are rugged and perform well on @entity1 's sandy trails			1
the first vehicle put into operation -- our ride for the day -- has been dubbed " @entity86			2
" " most of you will have been on a game drive , and you would have had to put up with the diesel motor and the noise , and the vibration and smoke , " @entity75 says			0
" just think about that when you drive @entity86 , and think about the contrast			0
" @entity1 is special because of the concentration of game along the riverfront , giving visitors the option of both game drives on land and cruises on the water			0
the national park is also known for its large elephant population , with upwards of 120,000 elephants in the @entity1 area			0
the best time to visit is during the may to october dry season , when animals gather near the river			2
when the rains come , the herds disperse into the bush			0
the upside is that there are few tourists , the downside is scant wild animals to be seen			2
in front of the @entity29 , running above the river , is a long boardwalk punctuated by seating and viewing areas from which visitors can spot grazing hippos , plus warthogs , impalas and all sorts of bird life			0
@entity133 's honeymoon suite it 's easy to see why the actress @entity133 fell in love with this place , visiting @entity29 repeatedly and even marrying @entity137 -- for the second time -- on the river 's edge			1
( a tip for @entity133 fans : request room 210 to stay in her honeymoon suite , the most private of all rooms , with its own plunge pool and terrace			0
) the five - star lodge 's decor has been updated since the 1975 wedding , so -- perhaps mercifully -- none of the taylor - era feel is preserved			1
now there 's an airy @entity156 - inspired design , complete with oversized cushions , wooden frames and vintage lanterns			2
most international visitors to @entity1 will arrive at the small @entity161 , 15 kilometers ( 9.3 miles ) from the lodge , connecting from either @entity163 in neighboring @entity23 , or from @entity49 's capital @entity165			1
both are about a two - hour flight away			0
@entity168 is probably the only airport in @entity23 to have its own parking bay for electric vehicles -- a new addition , with the lodge intending to use electric @entity3 for ferrying guests			1
day trips are possible from @entity1 to @entity64 , on the @entity51 - @entity52 border , only 90 minutes away			0
@entity177 , ceo of the company that owns @entity46 , and a board member for the national park , worries about the growing number of big polluting boats on the @entity60 , and general crowding in the riverfront area			1
he and the @entity1 board want river traffic restricted to electric boats , with the exception of fishing boats and local ferries , within three years			2
" this is the way to go , " @entity177 says			0
" it 's going to revolutionize what happens on the river here			2
" on land there are safari vehicle traffic jams , mostly polite though some tourists lose the plot			0
i watched as a khaki - clad @entity203 visitor screamed at another group of tourists for momentarily blocking his distant view of sleeping lions			0
as in most other national parks , vehicles are n't allowed off the tracks at @entity1 , in order to protect the natural environment			2
sounds of silence as the only lodge within the national park 's boundaries , @entity46 is well positioned			1
morning drives and afternoon cruises generally start a half - hour early to get a head start on the other tourists			0
all of the guides are women , highly unusual at game lodges across @entity23			1
the lodge also offers a more unusual tour			1
@entity226 , 62 , a longtime employee , leads an eco-tour that takes guests behind the scenes , into the kitchen , laundry room and other places a tourist would never normally visit			0
@entity226 proudly explains the process of recycling glass bottles into cement bricks used for building , reusing gray water for the garden , and shows off the interesting ( though rather smelly ) bio gas plant , in which food waste is converted into methane gas used for cooking			0
" this is our park , " @entity226 tells us			0
" we have to look after it			0
" on a late - afternoon river cruise , we experience the sounds of silence again			0
as our electric boat turns a bend , we spot a herd of elephants tentatively coming down to the river for a drink of water			2
an african fish eagle sits motionless as we glide by			0
a crocodile basking on the shore 's edge does n't move either , until a grumpy elephant decides to chase it away			2
we sit watching and listening to the elephants as dusk settles over the @entity60			0
but the next morning is a rude awakening : back to a bumpy old diesel - fueled @entity3 for our final game drive through the park			1
the lodge 's fleet is still being converted to electric and it is a slow process , though the plan is to have a total of 13 game drive vehicles and six boats			1
our guide catches sight of a @entity280 and we pull up to get a better look , our diesel motor roaring			0
my seatmate puts down his camera , grumbling : " it would still be there if we were in the electric vehicle			2
" @entity29 , @entity290 , @entity49 ; +267 625 0340			0

@entity46 is converting its fleet of @entity3 to run off electricity
electric vehicles are less environmentally *harmful* and quiet enough to sneak up on animals
the lodge 's guides are all women -- unusual for safaris in @entity23
