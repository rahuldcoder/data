-- during the @entity3 ' dinner on saturday night , @entity1 made a joke that president @entity5 laughed at , but that you could see was just killing him inside			1
" mr. president , do you remember when the country rallied around you in hopes of a better tomorrow ? " @entity1 asked			2
that was your best one yet			0
i 'm sure he still has a lot of hope			0
but i would dare to say the thing that changed most over these past three years is @entity5			2
the unbridled optimism that his first campaign once embodied has been bludgeoned by dogmatism , pragmatism and bipartisan cronyism			0
@entity25 and change are tough when the worst economy in 80 years is waiting to greet you at the door			2
@entity25 and change are challenging when @entity30 , the unofficial gatekeeper of the conservative movement , tells his troops " i hope @entity5 fails " before your first day on the job			2
@entity25 and change are virtually impossible when working with a @entity35 so dysfunctional that its approval rating never reached 25 % in all of 2011 and was as low as 10 % in february			0
no wonder his hair is a bit grayer these days			0
and no wonder the new @entity5 slogan is " forward			1
" " @entity48 " captured the heart of a people who believed one man could change the culture of @entity47			1
" forward " acknowledges things are not where he said they would be , but takes ownership of a record that shows he at least has us pointed in the right direction : 12 consecutive months of job losses before he took office , 25 consecutive months and counting of job growth since 2010			2
it 's not as sexy , but at least it 's honest			2
after all , @entity62 is still open			0
unemployment is still above 8 %			0
housing prices are still low			0
this is why probably why @entity66 felt comfortable enough to send out this tweet : " the promises that candidate @entity5 made are very different than what president @entity5 delivered			1
" embedded in the tweet was a video , showing @entity5 in 2008 promising to go through the federal budget line by line to cut fat , and then fast forwarding to today with stats about the growing debt and the nearly $ 1 million wasted on the now infamous @entity78 conference			1
had another challenger posted the ad , it would have landed a solid right hook to @entity5 's re-election bid			1
but it was @entity66 , so it was more like a boomerang -- an aggressive attack sent out but ultimately coming back to its sender			1
the last person who should want to start a video rewind contest is @entity66 , who has enough flip - flops and broken promises captured on film that he could start his own network			1
nonetheless , while the messenger is a bit shaky , the overall message is not			0
@entity5 has indeed fallen short on quite a few of the promises he 's made over the years			1
and the campaign slogan " forward " reflects those shortcomings and challenges : obstructionist @entity103 determined to bring him down , self - serving @entity104 too scared to pass a budget , and a public so dense that at one point it thought @entity109 would make a good president			1
but at the end of the day , @entity5 has only himself to blame for the malaise of disappointment that has draped much of his presidency			2
a disappointment , mind you , that has less to do with his actual policy than with his inability to reach the ridiculously high bar he set for himself over the years			0
tweets like @entity66 's are not necessarily fair -- after all , nothing happens in a vacuum -- but @entity5 was the one who made all of the promises			1
he was the one who set the standard			0
he is the one sitting in his own prison			0
i doubt he 'll ever say it , but i bet if he had a chance to do it all over again , he would underbid rather than overbid his hand			0
@entity66 will continue to hammer away at what @entity5 has n't done -- and he should -- if for no other reason than hoping to distract voters from seeing all of the things @entity5 has accomplished			1
like preventing insurance companies from denying people with pre-existing conditions , courtesy of the flawed but helpful @entity143 ; overturning " do n't ask , do n't tell ; " appointing two women to the @entity145			0
that was one of candidate @entity5 's promises , you know			1
in 2007 he said he would get @entity146 , even if it meant going into @entity152			0
this week marks the one - year anniversary of president @entity5 delivering on that promise			1
funny , for some reason that clip did n't make it into @entity66 's ad			1
i 'm sure it was an oversight			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

in 2008 , " @entity48 " was @entity5 slogan ; this year it 's " forward "
@entity164 says president @entity5 's *ambitions* have been scaled back
he says economy , @entity47 dysfunction , @entity103 *opposition* have gotten in the way
@entity164 says @entity66 's flip - flops make it hard for him to hold @entity5 *accountable*
