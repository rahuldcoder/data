@entity0 -- traveling down @entity0 's @entity3 , 4 - year - old @entity2 sees his favorite store , @entity5 , from the back seat of the family 's suv			2
but before he can even ask , his mother answers quickly			2
" we ca n't go in , " she says			2
" too many people in there			2
" stores are n't the only places off limits for @entity2			2
so are movie theaters , malls , schools and playgrounds			2
" we live in isolation pretty much from november until may because of the sickness that @entity2 has , " says his mom , @entity21 , as the family drives to a @entity25 hospital for @entity2 's monthly treatment			0
that sickness is opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome ( @entity32 ) , an extremely rare neurological disorder that can affect his motor skills and cause rapid , involuntary eye movements			0
@entity2 developed the illness when he was about 1 , as a result of having low - stage neuroblastoma cancer			1
his cancer is now in remission , but the @entity32 treatment leaves his immune system so fragile that even the slightest exposure to germs can be detrimental			1
" if @entity2 gets sick , even a simple cold could cause his @entity32 symptoms to come out , " his mother said			0
" his immune system attacks his brain , thinking that he still has neuroblastoma cancer			1
that 's why we have to try to keep him away from anyone with illnesses			0
" for much of his childhood , @entity2 has rarely ventured beyond his home or played with other kids			0
his only friend and playmate was his healthy twin sister , @entity58			0
all that changed last year , however , when his parents enrolled him and his sister at the @entity63 , a preschool program in @entity65 , @entity0			1
the @entity66 was created especially for children who are undergoing treatment for cancer and have a suppressed immune system			1
@entity58 was enrolled so she would n't bring home germs from a different preschool			1
" they love it because they get to be around other kids , which they 're not used to , " @entity21 said			0
battling a life - threatening disease is tough at any age , but it can be especially difficult for young children who have to be kept in isolation			1
@entity84 learned this firsthand after her daughter , @entity86 , was diagnosed with cancer at age 2			1
" it was horrible that she had leukemia , " said @entity84 , 46			0
" it made it worse for us that she could n't socialize			0
so not only was she at the hospital and dealing with the side effects , but also she could n't have that normal part of her childhood			0
" @entity86 , now 13 and cancer - free , remembers the pain and the needles , but also that she could n't go to preschool			1
" the only friend i had was my brother , " she said			0
@entity84 was so concerned with @entity86 's isolation and lack of social development that she hired a play therapist to teach @entity86 some of the things that most kids take for granted , like playing , sharing and taking turns			1
one day at the hospital , @entity84 noticed there was a play area for young cancer patients where @entity86 was able to play with another child			1
" i thought , ' well , this is ok because this child also has a minimal world of exposures , also can not be around other children due to a suppressed immune system , ' " @entity84 said			1
" it was safe for them to play together			1
" by the time @entity84 got home that day , she had a clear idea for what would eventually become the @entity66			1
" we need to start a program for children with cancer , " she told her husband , " so there can be a place where they can go and socialize and have friends and learn and play			1
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity141 the @entity142 opened the @entity66 in september 2003 , just a few months after their daughter was deemed cancer - free			1
it has since provided a free preschool experience for more than 150 children			1
on the surface , the @entity66 might look like any other preschool : colorful toys , shelves lined with books , walls adorned with educational posters , children gleefully engrossed in activities			1
but it 's different in many ways			0
because of the children 's delicate immune systems , they are required to sanitize their hands throughout the day			1
they also have individualized supply boxes with their own crayons , glues and @entity167			0
they never share supplies , and all items are meticulously cleaned by teachers after each use			0
" exposure to a simple childhood cold or illness can become life - threatening to these children , " said @entity84 , who also teaches at the school			2
three times a week , students learn to read , sing and create arts and crafts			2
on fridays , they have show - and - tell			0
there are parties during the holidays			0
and a few times a year , there are organized field trips			0
" it 's wonderful to see my daughter be like a normal kid , " said @entity187 , one of the students ' mothers			0
@entity84 says the @entity66 is the only program of its kind in @entity196			1
it is funded entirely by private donations and fundraisers , and the students are referred by local cancer hospitals			2
because there is no medical staff on site , the students ' parents remain on the premises during the day			0
but this has also created a wonderful opportunity for parents that @entity84 did not envision when she started the program			1
" the parents have formed friendships , " she said			0
" they have also formed support groups			0
they understand what each other is going through , and over the course of the years , the @entity66 has become so much more than what we even intended it to be			1
" for many parents , that support and socialization has made a remarkable difference and provided a much - needed break from hospitals and isolation			0
" this is the only place where you can gather parents that have this common bond of cancer , " @entity187 said			1
" you know what it 's like that your kids are on steroids			0
you know what chemo does to your kids			0
it 's just a wonderful place to gather and have a cup of coffee and talk about things that are difficult to talk about with people who just do n't know what you 're going through			2
" the program has been so successful that a second center on @entity252 is in the works , and @entity84 has been approached to replicate the model in other states			2
" part of me relives @entity86 going through treatment ( with ) every new child that i meet and every parent that 's telling me their story , " @entity84 said			0
" but to see the smiles on their faces and ( to see the children ) reclaiming their childhood , that feeling is such a joy that it 's indescribable			2
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity66 website at www.themorgancenter.org and see how to help .			1
