-- an @entity2 student said he got a three - day suspension for creating a controversial @entity5 hashtag encouraging discussion of the school district 's failed budget			1
@entity9 , a senior at @entity10 , says he created # s * * @entity11 to brainstorm ways his school could save money in response to voters on tuesday rejecting a $ 144.7 million budget plan			1
the budget did not receive the 60 % voter approval it needed			2
many students were concerned , @entity9 said , because the school board had warned that if a new budget was not eventually passed , they might have to eliminate athletic programs , other extra-curricular activities and introduce additional administrative cuts , including the elimination of some teacher positions			1
the budget is up for a revote on june 18			2
" everyone on @entity5 was talking about ' i ca n't believe the budget did n't pass ' and so i created ( the hashtag ) as a joke , really , " @entity9 told @entity0 on friday			1
at first , according to @entity9 , his ideas for cutting the school budget were meant to be funny and absurd			1
they included cutting the lights because if teachers were n't being paid , students would have no schoolwork they 'd have to see			0
he also suggested holding classes outside to save on air conditioning costs			0
students at the school joined in on @entity5 , using the hashtag with their own cost - cutting ideas			1
" @entity48 " said @ @entity47			0
" cheerleading " said @ jamierunge			0
" there 's honestly not much left at this point , " wrote @ @entity50			0
@entity9 , 18 , says the tweet that got him in trouble was a call for the termination of the school 's executive principal			1
" i said we should cut her , because i do n't think she does a good job			0
but that 's just my opinion i was sharing on @entity5 , " he said			0
according to @entity9 , on thursday he was called into the office and told he would be suspended for three days for harassing the principal , using a mobile phone in class and disrupting the learning environment			1
@entity70 superintendent dr. @entity69 told @entity0 she was aware of the situation , but could not comment on disciplinary matters related to specific pupils			0
" we have a student code of conduct that is a policy we abide by , " said @entity69			2
" students and parents know the expectations of this policy , and whenever a situation arises where a student does not meet those expectations we deal with it accordingly			2
" @entity9 , an executive board member for his class on the student council and a community volunteer , says he has never been in trouble with the school before			1
while he admits to using his phone in class , @entity9 said his teacher never addressed it at the time , and he never threatened anyone			1
" i 'm not a bad student , " @entity9 said			1
" @entity11 says they want student involvement in what goes on in our school , and next thing i know i 'm in trouble			2
a 45 - year - old man can speak his opinions about the school district , but i ca n't because i 'm a student ? " " i just want ( the school board ) to remove the suspension from my record and choose their battles better , " said @entity9 , who played on the school lacrosse team			1
@entity9 's original tweets have since been deleted			2
he said he will be allowed to graduate and take part in graduation ceremonies with his class			2
but he said he still feels like his reputation has been tarnished			0
" i really do n't plan on filing any appeal or anything			0
i really just wanted my opinion out there			0
they seem to have all the power so i went and got more power with social media			0
" by friday , a new hashtag had emerged : # @entity126 .			0
