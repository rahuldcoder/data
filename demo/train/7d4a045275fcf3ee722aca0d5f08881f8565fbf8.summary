this week , @entity0 announced their new budget with a highly produced video full of great rhetoric and patriotic music , but one major piece of @entity6 is missing -- a single mention of the middle class			1
the narrator , @entity10 chairman @entity9 , had promised to offer a " path to prosperity " but instead introduces economic policies that represent a dead end for @entity16 's middle class and @entity16 manufacturing			1
rarely has a budget been so brazen about protecting the richest and most powerful at the expense of the rest			0
@entity9 , considered by many to be an ideological leader of conservative thought , correctly asserts that this is a moment for @entity16 to choose between different futures			0
he then outlines the conservative vision that @entity16 have rejected over and over again -- increasing @entity16 debt through special deals to protect the most powerful corporations and dumping that burden onto the already struggling middle class			1
though @entity9 's plan has deliberately avoided explaining how the tax numbers add up , in order to pay for the massive tax cuts at the top , everyone else would have to pay more			2
it 's likely that a middle - class family with two kids making about $ 70,000 a year would pay about $ 1,150 more in income tax , according to calculations made by the @entity43			2
that 's an 80 % increase over what they pay now , while millionaires will pay less			0
that same family currently receives about $ 5,500 worth of federal support from k - 12 education , transportation , health and science research , consumer safety , natural resource protections and federal law enforcement			0
the @entity0 budget would cut these " nondefense discretionary spending " by about 25 % , taking away a typical family 's services and protections by about $ 1,400 per year			1
to borrow a phrase from @entity65 - winning economist @entity64 , these budget priorities are truly " of the 1 % , by the 1 % and for the 1 %			0
" opinion : @entity0 budget will tackle economic challenges @entity10 @entity0 further threaten the middle class by rewarding companies for sending @entity16 jobs overseas			1
they want to revive the outsourcing loopholes that @entity73 , including myself , have fought hard to close			0
these loopholes would exempt overseas profits from taxes , creating a greater incentive to relocate investments to other countries and leaving more of the tax burden to our middle class			1
but this goes beyond economics to our values			0
why else would father @entity87 , a constituent of @entity9 's and a catholic priest , be moved to note his disappointment with the " cruel budget plan " that does n't match the @entity93 teaching of " justice for the poor and economic fairness " ? the @entity0 ' budget video shows a suburban family arriving home in a @entity99 , rather than a @entity100 or a @entity101			1
one can logically conclude that this was a self - conscious decision not to use a product of the @entity16 auto industry that their party and likely nominee , @entity109 , said should be allowed to die			0
the @entity0 present a hypothetical choice going forward , but this reminds @entity16 that there were real choices already made over the last few years -- whether to let @entity16 crash into a @entity114 , permit our auto industry to fail or let @entity117 for senior citizens become insolvent by 2017			2
at each of these points , as now , conservatives have put the political gain of making @entity123 a one - term president by opposing his efforts to save the economy and fix @entity117 , ahead of making tough decisions to protect the middle class and senior citizens			2
the @entity0 budget is not a cruel joke			1
it is the very real and logical result of the economic theory that conservatives from @entity9 to @entity109 embrace -- that it is the richest @entity16 who create jobs and add to the economy , not the middle class			1
this is not a " bold and right " call for shared sacrifice as @entity109 suggested of last year 's similar budget			0
it is simply forcing the middle class and senior citizens to take a hit to protect corporate subsidies and tax breaks for the rich and powerful			2
many , including myself , had hoped for big ideas , but instead we got a new turn on an old congressional one -- a bridge to nowhere for 99 % of @entity16 .			0

@entity154 : @entity10 @entity0 's new budget plan dumps more of tax burden on the middle class
he says *proposal* would be a dead end for @entity16 's middle class and manufacturing
@entity154 says plan 's theory is essentially that the richest create jobs and add to economy
@entity154 : @entity0 budget is not a cruel joke but logical result of conservative economic theory
