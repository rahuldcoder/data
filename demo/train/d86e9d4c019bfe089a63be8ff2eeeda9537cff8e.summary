-- the little - known @entity1 shocked the world of golf as he stormed to his first ever major win on sunday with a runaway seven - shot victory at the @entity6 at @entity7			1
not bad for a farm boy who failed to make the cut in seven of his previous eight major championships			2
@entity1 joins @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 as @entity15 winners of the famous @entity16			1
despite many having difficulty pronouncing his name , few will forget @entity21 's dazzling performance at @entity7			2
the win really is a fairytale story for the 27 - year - old who lives on a farm in @entity26 , @entity15 , next door to his parents			1
@entity1 , who also has a home in @entity31 , @entity32 , was born in @entity33 , @entity15			1
his father was a farmer by trade yet all young @entity1 wanted to do growing up was play golf and tennis			2
@entity1 decided to ditch the tennis racket for good in favor of the club when he was 10 before spending three years at the @entity13 & @entity41 during his teenage years			0
@entity1 seals runaway @entity43 @entity6 victory @entity1 is eternally grateful to the foundation , which was set up by @entity13 in 1999 to help nurture @entity15 's next generation of star golfers			1
it gave him financial support and coaching on the course his family could never offer their son			0
" it was unbelievable what he ( @entity13 ) did for me , " @entity1 told the official @entity43 @entity6 website			2
" he is such a good mentor and probably without him , those three years in his foundation , i would n't have been here			0
" it was not long before the future @entity43 @entity6 champion started tasting success after teaming up with compatriot @entity65 to win his first title at the @entity67 in 2000			2
the teenager then claimed six amateur titles including the @entity71 title in 2002 before turning professional at 19 in the same year			1
but despite hitting a 57 during a practice round on the par - 72 @entity76 course , along with gaining his @entity78 card in 2003 , his early performances in the paid ranks were less impressive			0
he did manage to record the first of his eight professional wins on home soil at the 2004 @entity83			0
but joy was quickly turned into despair as " @entity86 " -- as he is fondly known to his friends due to his gap - tooth smile -- failed to qualify for his first @entity6 at @entity7 in 2005			1
the season ended in disappointment as @entity1 finished 139th on the money list forcing him to return to qualifying school to regain his @entity78 card			0
' @entity86 ' takes charge at @entity7 the @entity15 responded to the early setback by making 2007 his best year so far on the golf circuit , winning three titles on the @entity97 including the @entity99 pga championship			1
however , @entity1 's stop - start career continued as he failed to play in a major after missing the cuts for the masters , the @entity6 and the @entity104 in 2009			1
but 2010 is without doubt his most successful and memorable year on and off the course to date			0
first , @entity1 became a father after his wife @entity108 gave birth to their baby daughter @entity110			1
then in march he finally won his first @entity78 event at the @entity113 in @entity114 beating @entity32 's @entity115 and @entity116 of @entity117 , who were tied second by three strokes			0
a victory of sorts in @entity121 was next , as the @entity15 won the @entity122 at the @entity123 in april , but he missed the cut in the tournament proper at @entity126			0
he also missed the weekend action in the @entity128 at @entity129 so the signs were not promising as he traveled to the east coast of @entity117 for the third major of the season			0
having missed the cut at the @entity6 in 2004 , 2006 and 2009 , few , if any , envisaged him collecting the trophy at the end of play on sunday			0
yet @entity1 left @entity138 , @entity139 and the world number one @entity141 in his wake , with his final round of one - under - par 71 giving him a 16 - under total of 272 and his only major title so far .			2

@entity1 stormed to his first major win at the @entity6 at @entity7
the 27 - year - old lives on a farm in @entity26 , @entity15 , next door to his parents
@entity1 is a *graduate* from the @entity154 before turning professional at 19
he also became a father after wife @entity108 gave birth to their daughter @entity110
