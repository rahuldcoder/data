-- the age of the virtual assistant is here to stay with @entity3 adding the voice of @entity5 to its @entity6			1
i 'm old enough to remember the days when certain computing tasks required a steep learning curve			0
now it seems almost magical that i can tell my virtual assistant to remind me to take out the garbage when i get home or call my mom when i get busy			1
the best part is that when it speaks to me , it does so in a way that allows me to believe , for a brief moment , that i 'm interacting with another person			0
that 's because these virtual assistants sound so human			1
for the creators of artificial intelligent systems , it 's critical to build them so that they can facilitate emotional connection with users			2
when machine interactions with humans feel effortless , natural and " real , " that 's the ultimate metric of success			2
we 're just getting started			0
today 's artificial intelligence systems are just scratching the surface of what 's possible for personal assistants , advisors and maybe , in some cases , true companions			1
indeed , the machine - human relationship in the movie " her " may not seem so far - fetched in the decades to come			0
future virtual assistants will offer far more capabilities and can be personalized for each person			1
why should we settle for the voice that companies choose for us ? we 've known for quite some time that typically female voices are preferred , based on their ability to be heard in a clear manner across a broad range of devices			2
of course , female voices also tend to be trusted more than male voices			0
however , if there is one request heard over and over again , it 's for more and varied choices in the persona of these virtual assistants , along with greater control over their spoken voice			1
creating text - to - speech , or @entity63 , can be a difficult task			0
the more human the system needs to sound the more data needs to be collected			0
often times this requires massive amounts of linguistic and acoustic information , based on recordings of real humans			0
fortunately , the technology is rapidly evolving			0
future modeling techniques , where @entity63 voices are made from mathematical models of its human counterparts , will be lifelike enough to simulate human speech			2
they will also allow more rapid voice creation , allowing a previously unachievable level of personalization , where each person could even pick his or her unique voice for a virtual assistant			1
modeling technology will also make possible the combination of different voice traits			0
for example , the deep qualities of a voice similar to @entity92 could be combined with the unorthodox speaking style of someone like @entity96			0
@entity3 took a page from the gaming world by basing @entity5 on the character from the @entity101 video game series			1
perhaps future voices in our devices will be as readily available to manipulate to create a cacophony of recognizable personal assistants from favorite film and tv actors , radio hosts , family members , comedians -- the sky would be the limit			2
whether it 's a character from our favorite game or movie , or a persona created by users themselves , we could allow our virtual assistants the freedom to keep us entertained as well as informed			1
while there is a fine line between personalization and novelty , i see us on a collision course for having more intelligent conversations with our digital assistants in the years ahead			0
the gadget - oriented systems of today will continue to grow and adapt to our ever - expanding needs , and the more they learn about us , the more they can assist us			2
when looking at the challenges facing humanity , whether it 's eradicating disease , solving our planet 's renewable energy needs , or even colonizing other worlds , it 's worth pondering if it will be the humans or the intelligence systems that we create that will tackle these problems			1
and will we be listening if it 's the virtual assistants that are doing the work ?			1
