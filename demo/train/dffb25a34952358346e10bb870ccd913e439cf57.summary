-- after @entity1 changed a new show 's mildly profane title during development , upcoming comedy " @entity7 " has now more - or-less reverted to its original head - turning name			1
the official new title of the show is " @entity7 , " dashing out the letters of the curse in an attempt to soften its impact ( not entirely unlike how @entity15 solved buying short - lived " @entity16 " last season , substituting the non-word " $ # * ! " )			1
the @entity20 - owned network has two upcoming shows that previously used the word " b * * ch " in their title -- " do n't trust the b * * ch in @entity7 " and drama " @entity26 * * ches			1
" the former was shorted to " @entity7 " right before the network 's broadcast upfront presentation in may			2
the latter was change to " @entity34 , " and was then changed again to " @entity26			1
" ( " @entity26 * * ches , " in particular , was singled out by some culture critics who were ready to pounce on the show should it hit the air with its original title )			1
' @entity40 ' : @entity41 was there ! ( not that @entity43 noticed ) in the case of " @entity7 , " the new title was rather anonymous ; it did n't tell you anything about the show			2
the new version more clearly suggests the show 's premise -- about a naive midwesterner ( @entity53 ) who moves in with a hardcore party girl ( @entity55 )			0
and given that @entity15 ' " 2 @entity59 " and @entity61 's " @entity60 " have successfully launched girl - with - new - roommate ( s ) - in - the - big - city premises this fall , the cleverly written " @entity7 " might likewise pop for viewers			0
the show does not yet have a premiere date , but is expected to debut sometime this season			0
although networks are wary about the swear word in a show 's title , on - air use is fair game			2
according to a story in the @entity77 a couple years ago , the use of the word " b * * ch " in primetime tripled in the last decade , growing to 1,277 uses on 685 shows in 2007 from 431 uses on 103 prime - time episodes in 1998			0
