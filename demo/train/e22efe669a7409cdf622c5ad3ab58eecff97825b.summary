-- the final day of the @entity2 transfer window produced the usual flurry of frantic activity friday but no big deal to match the $ 61 million transfer of @entity7 from @entity8 to @entity9 earlier this month			1
@entity10 's @entity8 continued to re-invest the money until the last day , landing promising 19 - year - old @entity13 central defender @entity12 , who signed from @entity14 for a reported fee of $ 19 million before being loaned back to the @entity17 side			1
@entity12 , who has just served a 10 - game ban for a foul challenge which broke an opponent 's leg , is the fourth player to sign for @entity23 's big spenders in january after @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			0
@entity8 's @entity27 rivals @entity28 , battling against relegation from the @entity30 , landed @entity32 international striker @entity31 from @entity33 for a fee of nearly $ 20 milllion			1
the 25 - year - old is a national hero in @entity37 after scoring three goals in their two - legged @entity39 qualifying play - off against @entity41 last november			2
he will have to act as a replacement for former @entity9 star @entity44			1
the @entity46 international striker has gone on loan to cash - rich @entity48			1
@entity50 's team are challenging for the @entity13 league title but have lost their big money summer signing of @entity53 to injury and @entity44 will act as a high - profile replacement			2
@entity48 slipped six points behind leaders @entity58 friday as the reigning champions beat @entity60 2 - 0 with their big money signing from this window , former @entity64 midfielder @entity63 , coming on as a substitute for the capital giants			2
@entity30 title challengers @entity67 , who signed @entity70 from @entity71 before the start of the current season , strengthened their squad by the acquisition of experienced @entity77 international midfielder @entity76 from @entity78 on loan			1
" @entity67 is an amazing club with a lot of great players and a coach who has done really well here for a long time , " @entity76 told the club 's official website			0
but top of the table @entity88 have not added to their already strong squad , who are still campaigning on all four fronts under @entity93			0
@entity88 spent an estimated $ 100 million on player signings before the start of the current campaign , playing their part in record amounts changing hands by @entity30 clubs in the 2013 - 14 period			1
according to football finance experts @entity104 , the combined transfer spend of the 20 clubs had broken the £ 700 million ( $ 1.12b ) mark for the first time even before the frenetic last day of trading			1
this enormous sum is despite the likely restrictions imposed by @entity112 's new @entity111 ( @entity111 ) rules , which limit the losses clubs can make			0
but according to a top lawyer specializing in sports finances , the big spending epl clubs like @entity88 and @entity8 are unlikely to be troubled by the new regulations			0
" it seems the @entity111 rules are unlikely to have the desired effect of providing an even playing field if clubs generating huge losses can meet the rules , " @entity120 , a senior associate at law firm @entity121 , told @entity0			0
" @entity88 recently announced a £ 51m ( $ 81.6 million ) loss ( down from £ 97m last year ) but are confident that they will meet the @entity111 rules			0
" clubs have a number of ways to reduce their losses , including excluding money spent on youth development and facilities as well as amortizing transfer fees over the term of player ' contracts			2
" however , the significant increase in commercial and sponsorship income for the top clubs , as evidenced by @entity67 's recent kit deal with @entity145 , is likely to mean that the larger clubs can meet the rules but smaller clubs with less income are adversely effected			0
" @entity151 giants @entity152 and @entity71 , who signed @entity155 's @entity154 for a world record fee last august , kept their powder dry in the last day of trading , but other @entity2 powerhouses strengthened their squads			1
runaway @entity163 leaders @entity161 signed @entity165 - born forward @entity164 on loan from @entity167			2
@entity164 was a club record signing for @entity167 but has lasted less than five months at @entity169 's after he was reported to have had an altercation with teammate @entity171 last week			0
@entity172 also completed the big money signing of @entity175 midfield star @entity174 from @entity176 on a four - and - a - half year deal			2
last season 's @entity178 finalists @entity180 attempted to boost a flagging season by signing 21 - year - old @entity183 midfielder @entity182 from @entity184 on the final day of the window			1
@entity180 celebrated later friday by scoring their first @entity187 win in five games with a 2 - 1 victory at bottom side @entity190			0
@entity191 grabbed both their goals .			0
