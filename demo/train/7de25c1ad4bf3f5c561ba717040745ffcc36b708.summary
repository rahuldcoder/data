@entity0 is just one of 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country who was specifically excluded from signing up for the @entity3 , but it was n't until recently that she found a way around the system			1
" i did n't realize that as a @entity8 recipient , i would also be eligible to receive health insurance			1
it was thanks to a professor who told me and other undocumented students about our eligibility for @entity18 , " @entity10 told @entity11 en @entity12			0
deferred status , or @entity8 , refers to the @entity8 program enacted in 2012			2
it grants some undocumented youths temporary work authorization and a two - year reprieve from deportation			0
" states like @entity29 and @entity30 have realized that because of their higher undocumented immigrant population , it makes more sense to offer preventative care regardless of legal status , " said @entity26 , staff attorney for the @entity27			2
in the meantime , @entity29 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity30 and @entity39 , offer health insurance to low - income individuals granted deferred status			1
it 's creative workaround of the @entity3 restrictions because the states are not using federal funds for the programs			0
" normally , someone with deferred action status would be considered lawfully present for all purposes on a federal level , which would mean that those @entity8 grantees would 've been included in the @entity3 except that was changed about two months after the @entity8 program was announced , " @entity26 said			1
the administration still has time to reverse the rule because it have n't released a finalized rule , @entity26 added			0
' deferred status ' still means no federal health insurance no access to those federal tax credits being @entity8 grantees also means that in addition to being given a valid @entity65 number and the chance to get a driver 's license , they are also given a work permit , on which they pay state and federal taxes			1
but because of the rule change , they are n't eligible for federal tax credits that help make private insurance affordable in the insurance marketplaces			0
even though they 're a part of the workforce , the @entity8 program was not intended to provide federal financial assistance for health care			1
" instead , @entity8 is designed to ensure that governmental resources for the removal of individuals are focused on high priority cases , including those involving a danger to national security or a risk to public safety , " an administration official from the @entity83 @entity82 told @entity11			1
the justification to not include @entity8 grantees is still unclear to @entity26 , especially since the @entity95 administration fought to keep them from being deported			2
" this particular undocumented youth population calls @entity83 home , is ready and willing to work hard , but what happens if they get sick ? their options are limited and expensive , " @entity26 said			0
as it stands , the existing welfare reform law requires immigrants to have legal status and wait five years before they can qualify for federal income - based benefits such as @entity107 or the @entity108			2
that 's why @entity83 rep. @entity110 introduced a bill that would make legal immigrants and @entity8 grantees immediately eligible for health insurance			1
" although they pay taxes , more than 600,000 legal permanent residents are restricted from receiving federal health care benefits , " the @entity115 @entity114 said in a news release			2
" this lack of access leads to more visits to emergency rooms , where immigrants are forced to pay as much as $ 1,200 to treat common ailments like the flu and upper respiratory infections			0
" critics : health care access would increase illegal immigration critics such as media director @entity132 of the @entity133 argue that providing health care services would encourage more illegal immigration			1
" @entity138 hospitals are overwhelmed with uninsured people , and they 've been forced to come up with more money to accommodate these people -- largely because they 've encouraged them to come in , " @entity132 said in an interview with the @entity136			0
right now , the only other ways @entity8 grantees can receive health insurance is from their employer , being a spouse 's dependent , going to a community clinic or purchasing it on their own outside the exchange , paying the entire premium			1
@entity26 hopes the @entity27 's recommendation to allow @entity8 to take part in @entity3 will be taken into consideration			0
" it makes financial and practical sense to include @entity8 grantees in the @entity3 , " @entity26 said			0
" it would increase the pool that 's eligible for exchanges by adding generally young , healthy immigrants , and that would decrease health insurance costs for all of us			1
" if done , it could help as many as 1.7 million immigrant youths eligible for @entity8 status that are n't fortunate enough to live in states such as @entity30 or @entity29			0
@entity170 to issue id cards to undocumented residents many people are unaware of their eligibility for the @entity107 welfare program and , according to a study by the @entity179 , 125,000 more immigrant youths in @entity29 with deferred action status are eligible for the program			0
and an estimated 1 million undocumented @entity29 remain uninsured since the @entity3 went into effect this year and , according to a @entity183 study , " 71 % of uninsured immigrant youth have an existing need to access a doctor or specialist about their own health ; however , 53 % stated that they have n't seen a doctor for more than a year			0
" @entity10 said she felt constant pressure to stay healthy before she found out about her @entity18 eligibility			0
" lack of health coverage has been a big problem for me			1
whenever i got sick , my mom would have to make me home remedies to help me get better , " @entity10 said			2
while home remedies might provide some relief , it 's still considered @entity204 care , which means people are more likely to turn to the most expensive option -- the emergency room			1
the @entity183 study also found that 74 % of @entity29 's immigrant youths report they 've received services from public safety - net programs , such as emergency @entity18 , public hospitals and community or county health clinics .			2

administration official : @entity8 was never intended to provide federal assistance
rep. @entity110 introduced bill to give legal immigrants health insurance
some say services for undocumented immigrants would encourage illegal immigration
" lack of health coverage has been a big problem for me . i 've relied on home remedies "
