people in cars and on bikes whizzed by @entity3 as he sat on a sidewalk in @entity5 one day not so long ago			1
commuters poured out of the @entity8 metro station and rushed by on their way to school or work			0
tourists rumbled by on a double - decker bus			0
@entity3 hoped some of them paused to take notice of him			1
he hoped that somehow his presence on the sidewalk would help relatives and friends nearly 9,400 miles away , in his hometown -- the besieged @entity23 city of @entity24			1
that city near the @entity27 border has been the site of intense fighting for weeks between @entity31 extremists and @entity33 forces backed by fighter jets and bombers from the @entity36 and other countries			1
@entity3 longed to do what he could to help his fellow @entity39 -- even from a great distance , in the relative safety of @entity36			1
for a few recent weeks , that meant he sat on a sidewalk , refusing to eat and surrounded by signs			0
" @entity36 : support @entity33 boots on the ground , " one sign said			1
" stand up for freedom before it 's too late , " read another			0
a third told people how long he had been on hunger strike			1
" i felt it was my duty to undertake this hunger strike to share the pain and suffering of the people of @entity24 with the people of @entity36 , " he said from his perch on an overpass above @entity56 , strategically chosen for its foot traffic and proximity to a @entity59			1
the 51 - year - old @entity33 activist came to the @entity36 in 1999 after seeking asylum from @entity23			1
@entity3 had been a member of the @entity23 parliament before he fled out of fear of becoming a target of political violence			1
he now lives in @entity71 , where he works at a pastry shop , with activism occupying all of his free time			0
on the sidewalk the 15th day of his hunger strike began like most others before that			1
though it had been more than two weeks since he had eaten solid food , he remained in good spirits			0
he and a supporter , a @entity33 activist from @entity5 , unfurled banners			1
@entity3 went to a convenience store to stockpile @entity86			2
he unfolded his chair and loaded his sustenance into a large gray cooler bearing a sign that said " slavery ... abolish it forever ! " next to him stood a mannequin adorned in the brightly colored , beaded clothing traditionally worn by @entity33 women			0
at the foot of the mannequin sat yet another sign			0
this one said " @entity98 : $ 500.00 for @entity33 women			0
" that 's a reference to an @entity31 practice documented by human rights organizations : members of @entity31 have enslaved and sold women in parts of @entity105 and @entity23 they have captured since their dramatic and bloody ascent			1
most of the passers - by in @entity5 have no doubt heard news of the horrors @entity31 has inflicted on people in @entity105 and @entity23			1
they may have heard that the terrorists in @entity31 have beheaded people and gloated about it in online in gruesome videos			2
for many of them , what 's happening in parts of @entity105 and @entity23 under @entity31 control is a daily horror they hear about on the news			1
for @entity3 , it 's personal			2
worrying about friends and relatives many of his friends and family lived in @entity24 when @entity31 attacked this year , he said			1
" my immediate family , the women and younger siblings , they all left for @entity27 , " he said			0
" the able - bodied relatives of mine are fighting			1
" he said militants kidnapped his nephew and held him for five months , forcing him to watch violent videos			0
" he now prays five times a day , " @entity3 said			2
" we feel he has been disturbed but we are lucky to have him			0
" he said @entity31 also held two of his cousins for a time			2
his accounts are difficult to verify , but there is little doubt that @entity31 has kidnapped @entity33 children			2
@entity147 said in july that @entity31 kidnapped 133 @entity33 boys and held them hostage for a month			2
" two of the boys who escaped told the media that @entity31 was forcing the children to undergo lessons in @entity154 and jihadist ideology , and one of these boys said that @entity31 beat the children who misbehaved , " @entity147 said			2
a @entity33 teenager told @entity159 in june that he was among dozens of students abducted by @entity31 in may			2
he said he and the other students were on buses , riding home from school after final exams , when @entity31 fighters in pickups stopped them			2
the boys wound up in an @entity31 - controlled city , where they were forced to watch videos of executions and suicide bombings , said the teenager , @entity173 , who asked that his full name not be used for fear of his safety			1
" if you try to leave , " he recalled the militants saying , " we will cut your heads off			0
" yet he said he and three other boys managed to escape after a few days			0
what can one person do ? thousands of miles away in @entity5 , @entity3 hoped his hunger strike cast a spotlight on the suffering of people like the @entity33 teenagers kidnapped by @entity31			1
family and friends encouraged him to try a less hazardous form of protest , but he declined			0
instead , he sat and passed out fliers to anyone who would take one and tried to promote an online petition calling for a humanitarian corridor into @entity24			2
on day 18 , a supporter surprised @entity3 with a rocking chair to replace his weathered folding chair			2
that brought a grin to his face as he nestled back into his new home away from home , blocking the erratic wind with a placard reading " fasting for @entity24			0
" on day 19 , a @entity33 string duo strummed traditional music			0
@entity3 tapped his foot in rhythm , seeming to forget about his appetite for a short time			0
on his 22nd day of hunger strike , @entity3 held strong , exclaiming , " my stomach has stopped ordering me around ! " his doctor admired his spirit but ordered him to wrap it up			1
so the next day , surrounded by friends and supporters , @entity3 enjoyed a bowl of lentil soup there on the sidewalk he had occupied for more than three weeks			1
his hunger strike was over			1
did he accomplish anything ? was it worth it ? did he accomplish anything ? @entity3 mulled the question a few weeks after ending his hunger strike			1
" in doing what i did , i was not only trying to share the suffering of my compatriots , but also pay homage to the likes of @entity238 and dr. @entity239 , who thought if suffering has to be endured for the social good , the activists should undergo it first , " he said			1
a protest like the one he engaged in does n't lend itself to " immediate metrics , " he said , so it 's hard to quantify whether his efforts made a difference			0
" i may have reached thousands in person , " he said			0
a few news organizations told his story			0
so he reached people that way , too			0
did it do anything to help people in @entity24 ? that 's a hard question to answer , he said , but he has no regrets			0
" now that it is over , " he said , " i am glad i was able to do my bit for the people of @entity24			0
