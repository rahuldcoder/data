-- @entity2 's fairy tale return to the @entity3 has had the old romantics yearning for yesteryear			1
once a feared and respected name in @entity9 and @entity10 football , the club has been in the shadow ever since it reached the @entity13 final some 52 years ago			0
back in the big time , @entity2 has made a blistering start to its season , winning its first four games before being held to a 3 - 3 tie by champion @entity19			1
promotion last season promised a bright future for the club and recent weeks have not disappointed			0
just two defeats from its first nine games had fans dreaming of the old days when their side was a force in @entity10 football			2
champions @entity19 held as @entity2 set early @entity3 pace in 1959 , @entity2 won its one and only @entity3 title and went on to reach the @entity13 final the following year			1
just a mention of the 1960 @entity13 final will have the older supporters recollecting memories of how @entity39 , inspired by @entity40 and @entity41 , put the @entity9 to the sword that night			0
@entity41 , arguably one of the greatest players of his generation , scored four times , while di @entity40 netted a hat - trick as @entity39 ran out 7 - 3 winners in one of the finest football matches in the competition 's history			2
while the two clubs may have reached the pinnacle on that night in @entity56 , they soon took very different paths as @entity39 continued to conquer , while @entity2 began to fade			2
while @entity2 did reach the 1980 @entity59 , where it lost out to @entity9 rivals @entity60 , success has eluded the club in recent history			0
the club has struggled to compete with the giants of @entity65 , @entity19 and @entity66 , instead spending its time moving between the top two divisions			0
not since 2006 has the club appeared in @entity10 , where it competed in the now defunct @entity59 following its appearance in the @entity72 final			0
@entity65 set new record as @entity19 slip up against @entity66 while manager @entity75 has performed miracles , there have been signs that life at the top is beginning to catch up with @entity2			1
last weekend 's defeat by @entity81 , its second of the campaign , brought the players back down to earth			0
its home game against @entity90 , a team sitting bottom of the @entity3 at the start of the weekend , was supposed to provide the opportunity to get back on track @entity2 made the perfect start when @entity94 scored with an 18 - yard drive after just 20 seconds to claim his fifth goal in as many games			1
but while many expected @entity90 to capitulate , it was quite the opposite as @entity2 were forced on to the back foot for much of the contest			1
@entity101 , who was promoted from the second division alongside @entity2 last year , has struggled so far this term			0
but it refused to give up the fight and @entity106 fired home a 53rd minute equalizer to claim a point a lift the club off the bottom of the table			1
@entity65 unbeaten run in @entity3 halted by @entity115 the result means @entity2 has 20 points from its ten games so far this season and sits in third ahead of the rest of this weekend 's games			1
and what next for @entity75 's side ? well , that would be the small question of a trip to the @entity126 to face @entity65 side which reached last season 's @entity128 and has won eight of its nine league games this season			2
if @entity2 was unsure whether it was back in the big time , then next week will certainly provide a healthy dose of reality .			0

@entity141 's fifth goal in past games gave home side the **advantage** after just 20 seconds
