republicans looking to fault @entity1 hope the few hours the former secretary of state will spend in @entity3 on monday will remind voters of her less - than - perfect book roll - out and high - dollar speaking fees			1
@entity1 , who starts her day in @entity8 for a fundraiser with sen. @entity10 , will make two appearances in @entity3 on monday			1
she will first headline a fundraiser for @entity16 majority leader @entity15 at the @entity17 , then the former secretary of state will keynote a fundraiser or the @entity19 at the swanky @entity20			0
@entity0 are seizing on the second speech , where @entity1 , the prohibitive favorite for the @entity24 ' presidential nomination in 2016 , will collect $ 225,000 for her appearance , according to event organizers			1
although a @entity1 spokesperson argues that the fee will go straight to the @entity30 , @entity1 and @entity31 , the former first lady 's appearance in @entity3 on monday was possibly the most controversial and widely talked about paid speech @entity1 was set to give this year			1
" @entity1 's @entity37 , " said an email from the @entity36			2
" as @entity1 's @entity39 , @entity38			2
" " the much anticipated @entity43 speech reminds us that @entity1 's exorbitant fees and travel requirements are going to be problematic on her run for the @entity48 , " @entity36 press secretary @entity40 said in an email			1
when @entity1 's appearance at the @entity43 fundraiser was announced in june , students at the university protested the fact the foundation was spending money to bring @entity1 in at the same time that their tuition was going up due to budget issues			1
" in keeping with secretary @entity1 's long - standing history of advocating for students in higher education , we as student government leaders are asking that she charitably donate part or all of the $ 225,000 speaking fee she is reportedly making for this fundraising speech back to the @entity74 of @entity43 as a whole , " @entity59 , the @entity43 student body president , and @entity61 , the student government 's public relations director , wrote in a letter addressed to @entity1 's foundation			1
the letter goes on to ask @entity1 " to do what is right " and donate the money			0
" this would be an incredible opportunity for @entity1 to remain true to her commitment to higher education , " they write			0
the students , however , never heard from @entity1 or the foundation , but are not planning to protest outside the event on monday			2
@entity43 and @entity1 have defended the event			2
" private donations secured by the @entity43 foundation from donors funded her speaking fee which was paid to the @entity93 , " @entity87 , a spokesperson for @entity43 , said over the summer			1
university administrators have also argued that the money the event will bring in will far outweigh the money paid the @entity1			0
@entity1 also told @entity97 in august that " all of the fees have been donated to the @entity31 for it to continue its life - changing and life - saving work			2
" that has n't stopped republicans from using the fees to knock @entity1 's comments on her personal wealth			1
during the first interview of her book rollout @entity1 argued that she and her husband were " dead broke " when they left the @entity48 in 2000			0
the comment rang hollow , even to many @entity24 , given that the @entity115 went on to make millions on the paid speaking tour and in book sales			0
republicans used fees like that from @entity43 to constantly remind people of @entity1 's wealth and inarticulate comments for much of the summer			1
" greedy , " said @entity124 , executive director of @entity125 , an @entity126 super pac			0
" hey kids , i know that tuition is skyrocketing and you all are loaded up with student debt but i 'm going to go ahead and take in $ 1.8 million from your universities for 8 hours of speeches anyway , " @entity124 said in an email to reporters			0
@entity15 , who @entity1 will appear with on monday , did not pile on , however , and refused to criticize @entity1 's @entity43 speech			1
" anything we can do to focus attention on @entity43 , that 's extremely important to do , and this certainly will focus attention on @entity43 , and that 's why they have these people come , " @entity15 told the @entity137 in june			0
the @entity147 relationship , especially in the context of @entity1 's possible 2016 bid , has been on full display in the last six months			2
@entity15 sent a fundraising email for @entity152 over the weekend , touting @entity1 as someone " doing everything she can " to help @entity24 get elected in 2016			0
the @entity16 majority leader also invited @entity1 to headline his green energy conference in @entity3 earlier this year , where @entity15 said he had " such admiration for the @entity1 family			0
" " she 's the best , " @entity15 said of @entity1 .			0

@entity1 has two events in @entity3 on monday , the second for a @entity43 fundraiser .
republicans and students have *highlighted* @entity1 's speaking fee throughout the summer .
@entity1 has said her $ 225,000 speaking fee will go to the @entity31 .
