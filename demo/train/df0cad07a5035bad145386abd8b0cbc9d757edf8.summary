-- @entity1 is n't just lifting the veil on the complicated love lives of @entity5 women			1
she 's smashing down the door to their homes and inviting you in for a cup of tea			0
when the playwright took her one - woman show to the @entity14 last month , she became not just the first @entity5 to perform at the prestigious @entity16 arts festival , but the first to reveal a mysterious world that is n't as different from the @entity18 as you might think			1
against the painted backdrop of rambling @entity22 streets , @entity1 takes her audience deep inside the hidden rooms of @entity5 women , playing characters grappling with questions of love , marriage and divorce			1
it 's a rare glimpse into an intensely private world			2
but since she first started performing " @entity32 in @entity5 " seven years ago , @entity1 has been touched by the huge number of women telling her how much they associated with her characters -- regardless of whether they were from @entity36 or @entity37			1
" in the beginning i was really surprised to hear that , because i was writing it in @entity5 about myself and other women i knew , " said @entity1			1
" but i was also happy because i think at the end of the day the experiences of women are always connected somehow			2
and one of the objectives of the play is to create that strong dialogue for understanding			1
" @entity5 stereotypes when i meet @entity1 in the dimly lit dining room of a stately @entity55 hotel , she is as serene as the paintings on the wall , yet with the same huge , mischievous eyes which bring so much life to her characters on stage			1
later when i ask her age , she politely laughs off the question -- despite appearing strikingly youthful for a woman with two sons in their 20s			2
swathed in ornate fabrics and wearing a simple headscarf , the elegant academic with @entity69 accent is anything but the stereotypical image of the hidden @entity75 woman			1
" @entity5 is mysterious to the @entity18 because we are very private culture , " she said			1
" and i think it 's our responsibility to tell other women outside our world about our experiences , to break this mystery			1
" a laughing matter ? for @entity1 , the best way to crack open this unknown world is with laughter , using a wry playfulness on stage to explore the most intimate of relationships			2
in a nation where men can have more than one wife , one character deals with the prospect of her husband taking a second partner , by attempting to dig up dirt on her			0
meanwhile , another character turns her back on the traditional notion of love , and a " @entity5 prince galloping in on his horse			1
" " i prefer to take serious things and deal with them in a light - hearted way , " said @entity1			2
" i 've had feedback from people who say it 's enlightening			0
they do n't know so much about @entity75 women in general -- and less so @entity5 women			1
so it is an eye - opener			2
" " but we can not deny that we are a conservative culture and we are very sensitive to issues that could be viewed as ... unconventional , so we tread carefully			0
" conservative culture born in @entity5 , @entity1 spent much of her childhood in @entity121 , before studying for a doctorate in @entity124 literature at the @entity125			1
today she is an assistant professor at @entity126 in @entity37			0
but the deeply conservative kingdom is n't always an easy place for a divorced mother - of - two such as @entity1			1
this is a nation where women are banned from driving , and where male guardians grant permission for everything from traveling to opening a bank account			0
in the 2012 @entity136 , @entity5 was ranked fifth worst for equality of the 135 countries rated			2
however some reforms are on the way , with women allowed to enter parliament earlier this year , and set to get the vote in 2015			0
female director @entity144 -- whose film " @entity146 " is the country 's first nomination at the 2014 @entity149 -- is one of an increasing number of " firsts " for women in recent years			2
" when i was living as a divorcee there it was still hard , " said @entity1			0
" you have to deal with what society might think and because men are allowed more than one wife , women might fear you too			0
" there is that perception that it is better to be married			0
but that is less and less now for younger women			0
there are many who chose to go on scholarships provided by the government -- i think in the @entity69 we have 80,000 students studying			0
" when asked about the significance of her appearance at @entity175 , @entity1 remains modest , smiling broadly as she turns the question on me			0
" on a personal level i 'm lucky to be the first , " she says			0
" but i do n't think i 'll be the last			0
