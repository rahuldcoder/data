former @entity2 gov. @entity1 's decision to step down from his advisory role at @entity5 bank @entity4 at the end of the year became the latest indication he 's gearing up to jump into the presidential race — and underscored one of the main liabilities he could face if he does run			1
the move , first reported by @entity12 , comes just days after he announced on @entity13 plans to " actively explore " a presidential bid			0
testing the waters early , @entity1 's supporters say , will give him the opportunity to gauge his support and tackle some of the more controversial aspects of his tenure in public office and the private sector			2
while @entity1 is seen as a top @entity24 establishment pick for the party 's nomination , he 's expected to face a fierce fight from the conservative wing of his party if he jumps in the race , particularly on immigration , thanks to his previous support for a pathway to citizenship , and @entity37 educational standards			1
but his record on economic issues and his private - sector experience is certain to spark criticism as well , from both his left and right flanks			0
already he 's drawn scrutiny over his business career , with a recent @entity46 report examining his work in private equity and investment banking and declaring , " @entity1 has a @entity51 problem			2
" @entity1 aides and allies insist his business career wo n't be a problem if he runs			2
" he 's very comfortable with his conduct , with his businesses and how he has spent his time since he 's been governor , " @entity55 , a longtime @entity1 family friend and @entity24 strategist , told @entity57 earlier this week			0
but @entity1 's ties to @entity4 point to another potentially prickly issue for him — his support for the 2008 @entity67 bailout known as the @entity68 , which initially authorized $ 700 billion in loans from the @entity71 government to the banking sector			1
from september through december of 2008 , @entity4 benefitted from $ 8.5 billion in taxpayer dollars that were used to bail out failing insurance giant @entity74 , according to a 2009 report in @entity76			1
a spokeswoman for the governor said , however , he did n't join the firm until march 20 , 2009			0
but years later , during a 2012 hearing on @entity81 , @entity1 endorsed the bailout			1
" for a short - term solution to a problem that had global implication , i think that was probably the right thing to do , " he said			0
other potential presidential contenders are on record supporting @entity68 , including rep. @entity90 , who voted for it , and @entity93 gov. @entity92 , who signed a letter urging @entity95 to pass " an economic recovery package , " though he later said the letter was n't an explicit endorsement of @entity68 itself			0
related : @entity1 's record on taxes and in 2012 , @entity92 called @entity68 the " single biggest act of theft in @entity71 history			0
" sen. @entity104 , another potential presidential primary opponent , wrote in his book that @entity68 " represented everything that was wrong with @entity107 , " because of how it was passed			1
@entity92 's scramble to clarify his position on the issue underscores how politically unpalatable it 's been with the @entity24 base			0
conservative backlash over @entity68 and the health care reform law contributed to the 2010 @entity116 wave , and the @entity67 bailout remains a potent issue on both the far - right and far - left flanks of the major parties			1
@entity1 's comments , and his role with the bank as it emerged from the financial crisis — as well as his work for investment bank @entity126 , which he left after it collapsed in 2008 — could be fertile ground for @entity24 opponents looking for avenues of attack against him .			2

@entity1 supported the *federal* @entity67 bailout
he also worked for @entity4 , which eventually benefited from $ 8.5 billion in taxpayer money from the bailout
those issues could *provide* *fodder* for some of his conservative opponents in a presidential primary
