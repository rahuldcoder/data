the man known as " @entity1 " claimed his 22nd medal by winning gold as part of the @entity2 4 x 100m medley relay team on saturday , but @entity13 confirmed he has no desire to add to that tally in @entity16 in 2016			1
" i 'm done , that was my last race and this is my last @entity20 , " confirmed the 27 - year - old			0
" i 'm ready for the next chapter in my life			0
" @entity13 will leave @entity23 with four more gold medals , taking his career total to an unparalleled 18 , after delivering a string of performances which silenced a growing number of doubters			1
@entity1 cements legacy as an all - time great " looking back , i can say i 've done everything i ever wanted to , " said @entity13 , who won medals at three consecutive @entity20 after making his debut as a 15 - year - old at @entity35			1
" i do n't think it 's too bad to be able to look back on your career and say that			2
" @entity41 , a winner of two golds in the @entity45 capital , was tipped by many to outshine his compatriot , while @entity48 also rose to prominence by winning the 200m freestyle race and anchoring @entity52 's victorious 4 x 200m freestyle relay			1
" @entity41 and i like racing each other , " @entity13 said			1
" we bring the best out of each other			0
it 's fun racing him , he 's tough			2
he swims a lot of events , just like i do			0
we had the chance to go head - to - head quite a few times			0
" on the future of men 's swimming , @entity13 said he is looking forward to taking a back seat and watching new rivalries like the one between @entity41 and @entity48 develop over the next four years			1
" we saw some amazing times in the pool this year			0
i said to @entity48 that his 200m free was probably one of the top five greatest swims of all time			1
" it 's going to be cool watching these swimmers grow over the next four years and seeing the times they swim			2
that 's definitely something i 'll stay in tune with and check out what 's going on			2
" one swimmer who has grown at the @entity82 is @entity84 's @entity83 , the 16 - year - old who stunned the world when she swam the last 50m of her 400m individual medley heat quicker than @entity41 in the corresponding men 's race			1
the stunning feat led to suspicions of doping , although there is no evidence to suggest the double @entity20 champion has taken any performance - enhancing substance			0
" it 's kind of sad that people have a great swim and that 's the first thing they say , " said @entity13			2
" people who work hard -- it shows			0
there are people who just jump to that conclusion sometimes , and it 's not right			0
