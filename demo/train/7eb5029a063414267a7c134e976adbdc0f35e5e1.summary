from a sheep ranch in @entity1 comes the oldest slice of @entity3 we know			1
scientists say they have dated an ancient crystal called a zircon to about 4.4 billion years , making it the earliest confirmed piece of the planet 's crust			1
the findings -- the first to describe the zircon -- were published in the journal @entity15 on sunday			0
" this is the oldest and the best dated of all the crystals that have been reported , " said @entity16 , lead study author and professor in the @entity18 at the @entity19			2
this crystal is a translucent red , @entity24 said , but glows blue when bombarded with electrons			0
at 400 micrometers long , its biggest dimension is just a tad larger than a house dust mite , or about four human hairs			0
the crystal was found in an arid region north of @entity34 , @entity1 , in a low range of hills called the @entity37 , in 2001			1
scientists say the crystal 's chemistry -- specifically , the ratio of oxygen isotopes within it -- suggests that the temperatures on @entity3 4.4 billion years ago would have supported liquid water , and therefore perhaps life			1
two isotopes of an element are considered different if they contain different numbers of neutrons			0
" what we 've learned is that the @entity3 cooled much more quickly that people had thought , " @entity24 said			1
" the surface formed a crust much more quickly than people thought			0
" a brief history of @entity3 our planet is thought to be about 4.5 billion years old , but the oldest fossils are about 3.5 billion years old			1
that does n't necessarily mean that no life existed before that time , but no direct evidence has been found yet			2
the first rocks that have been found deposited by water are about 3.8 billion years old , @entity24 said			1
but very little is known about the first 600 million years or so of the planet 's history , known as the " @entity67 " because it was thought to be " hell - like , " @entity24 said			2
the leading theory is that @entity3 was bombarded by meteors in its early history			1
it took a big hit from an object the size of @entity75 about 4.5 billion years ago , leading to the formation of the moon			1
these impacts vaporized the @entity3 's crust and formed a super-hot magma ocean			2
evidence including this zircon suggests that within the first 100 million to 200 million years of its existence , our planet cooled enough to make crust			2
steam from the atmosphere condensed to make oceans			2
" once you know that there were oceans , it 's very reasonable that there would have been life that early " -- even when it was only 200 million years old , @entity24 said			1
how they did the study @entity24 and colleagues reported on a different crystal from early @entity3 in 2001 from the same @entity37 area			1
but there had been an open question regarding that crystal and others about how to determine the age			0
the standard method of dating such rocks involves looking at the radioactive decay of uranium atoms to lead			0
but if the lead has moved within the crystal over time , this could lead to a faulty estimate of age			0
if lead has migrated away from the area of the rock being tested , that could make the rock appear younger than it is , or older if lead has concentrated itself			0
in this new study , researchers used a technique called atom - probe tomography , which allows scientists to image single atoms of lead and determine the isotope ratio			0
scientists found that clumps of lead atoms had formed 1 billion years after the zircon crystallized			1
these clusters are tiny , about 5 to 10 nanometers in diameter			0
all that means that the lead atoms had n't moved enough to thwart scientist 's existing methods of determining the crystal 's age , @entity24 said			0
they determined that age to be 4.4 billion years old			1
" although incredibly laborious , their analytical technique can be applied to not only additional terrestrial zircons but also to zircons from meteorites and lunar samples , to perhaps tease out a detailed thermal history of magmatism and impacts , " @entity142 , professor of geology at @entity144 , wrote in an accompanying article in @entity15			0
meanwhile , on @entity75 @entity3 and @entity75 formed around the same time in the solar system			2
just as scientists are analyzing the chemical composition of rocks on @entity3 to learn about our planet 's history , @entity157 's curiosity rover is doing the same on @entity75			1
but one can only do so much via robot			0
@entity157 is planning a 2020 rover mission that may be able to collect samples for later delivery to @entity3			2
there , we may find even more extraordinary gems -- red or otherwise .			0

@entity3 is about 4.5 billion years old
the oldest piece was found in 2001 in @entity1
@entity3 could have had oceans very early in its history
