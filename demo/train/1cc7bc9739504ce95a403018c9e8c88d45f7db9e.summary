-- @entity1 , section 2 of the @entity3 grants the president " power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the @entity9			1
" with a stroke of his pen , the man in charge can make legal trouble disappear			2
as one might expect , this practice can be a bit controversial			2
president @entity17 signed and later was granted a pardon by the man who replaced him			1
president @entity19 pardoned 19 people on december 23 , 2008 , but withdrew one of those pardons for @entity23 a short time later			1
let 's take a look at some of history 's more notable examples			2
@entity29 in 1829 , @entity29 and an accomplice received death sentences for murder and robbing mail trains			2
his accomplice quickly took a trip to the gallows , but @entity29 had influential friends in @entity38			2
these friends beseeched @entity39 for leniency on behalf of their friend , and @entity42 relented			1
in 1830 , he pardoned @entity29 for his capital crimes ; the mail robber would only have to serve a twenty - year term for his other misdeeds			1
it sounds like great news for @entity29 , but when authorities presented him with the pardon , @entity29 perplexingly refused to accept it			1
after much legal back - and - forth , @entity29 's case came before the @entity54 , which ruled that since the pardon was a bit of property , there was no legal way to force @entity29 to accept it			1
like his accomplice , @entity29 was hanged			1
@entity17 @entity17 resigned in the wake of the @entity61 on august 9 , 1974 , and just under a month later newly installed president @entity62 gave his predecessor a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he may have committed while in office			1
while many observers decried the pardon as evidence of some backdoor dealing between @entity67 and @entity17 , @entity67 went on national television to explain that he felt the pardon provided the best way for the country to move on and close the discussion of @entity17 's antics			1
many @entity9 did n't buy this explanation , though ; even @entity67 's own press secretary resigned in disgust			2
@entity62 conceded that the unpopular pardon probably hurt his chances for reelection in the 1976 presidential race			1
@entity0 : how do ex-presidents make ends meet ? 3			2
@entity87 this name may not be immediately familiar , but you 'd probably recognize @entity87 's voice if he sang " @entity91			2
" as one - third of the folk outfit @entity92 , @entity87 dominated the music and protest scenes of the 1960s			0
@entity87 had legions of young fans , but unfortunately , some were a bit too young			0
in 1970 he was convicted of taking " improper liberties " with a 14 - year - old fan , an error for which he spent three months in jail			1
on his last day in office , though , @entity106 granted @entity87 a pardon			2
@entity87 , for his part , admitted he made a huge mistake and later contritely said , " it was an era of real indiscretion and mistakes by categorically male performers			0
i was one of them			0
i 'm sorry for it			0
@entity117 many modern fans may know @entity117 solely as the big - mouthed , big - spending owner of the @entity120 , but in 1974 " the boss " was also in a spot of legal trouble due to his shadowy connection with @entity17 's reelection campaign			0
after receiving 14 criminal indictments , @entity117 pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions and obstructing justice			0
the plea resulted in @entity117 coughing up a $ 15,000 fine , and @entity131 suspended him for a total of 15 months			0
in the closing days of his second term , though , @entity133 pardoned @entity117 for these offenses			1
@entity136 @entity136 was one of @entity138 's first stars in the 1950s and 1960s , and he later became a wildly successful team owner in the sport			1
however , despite all of his triumphs at the track , @entity136 had old legal problems hanging over his head			0
in 1956 , federal agents caught the rising @entity138 star working a moonshine still in @entity148 ; the arrest was particularly galling to @entity136 because he was a legendary moonshine - running driver			1
he received a two - year sentence for the crime and spent 11 months in federal prison			0
once @entity136 got out of jail , he resumed his dominance of the @entity138 circuit , but he was bothered by the loss of his voting rights as a convicted felon			1
in late 1986 , @entity133 pardoned @entity136 for his moonshining past			1

@entity163 @entity136 's not the only racing figure who has received a pardon , though			1
@entity163 , the owner of the @entity168 team that 's included such famed drivers as @entity170 , is also the owner of a giant chain of auto dealerships			0
during the import - crazed 1980s , getting @entity173 in your inventory often meant bribing @entity177 execs to send you a larger allocation of the popular cars			0
@entity163 played this game for his dealerships , and in the process gave execs thousands of dollars in cars , cash , and even houses			0
@entity186 in 1997 , he pleaded guilty to mail fraud in connection with these shenanigans			0
his sentence included a $ 250,000 fine , a year of home confinement , three years of probation , and an order to stay away from his racing team			2
in december 2000 , @entity197 pardoned @entity163			2
@entity199 : the heiress - turned - militant spent almost two years in prison for her part in a 1974 bank robbery before @entity106 commuted her sentence in 1979			0
@entity197 later gave @entity205 a full pardon on the final day of his presidency in 2001			2
every @entity209 soldier : on christmas day 1868 , president @entity210 declared a general amnesty that unconditionally pardoned everyone who 'd fought for the @entity209 during the @entity213			1
@entity214 : @entity197 's half - brother spent a year in prison after pleading guilty to cocaine distribution charges in 1984			0
when @entity197 issued a flurry of 140 pardons on his last day in office , his little brother was on the list			1
@entity214 did n't seem to appreciate his second chance , though ; less than a month later he was arrested for drunk driving and disturbing the peace			0
he later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge			0
@entity0 : presidential siblings and the headaches they caused 10			0
@entity229 , @entity230 , and @entity231 : these three convicted conspirators in the assassination of @entity234 served time for their crime , but all three received pardons from @entity210 in 1869			1
@entity237 : @entity237 doggedly fought against @entity9 troops during an armed conflict as federal forces tried to install @entity242 officials in the state			0
according to some accounts , @entity237 considered burning @entity245 to the ground and taking off for @entity247 , but he eventually decided to peacefully step down as governor instead			0
president @entity249 later pardoned @entity237 for his role in the fracas			1
