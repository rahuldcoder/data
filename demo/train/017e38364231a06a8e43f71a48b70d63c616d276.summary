republicans launched a blistering attack friday on the health care reform law upheld by the @entity3 , seeking to rally their base 's opposition to the measure to bolster their fortunes in the november election			1
using the court 's finding that the centerpiece of the law -- the individual mandate -- amounted to a legal exercise of congressional taxing power , @entity10 leaders accused president @entity18 and @entity19 of deceiving the nation about the @entity21 during debate on the measure in 2009 and 2010			1
@entity25 @entity10 leader @entity24 of @entity26 led the charge , saying @entity19 used a " deeply dishonest sales pitch " to overcome public opposition to the measure back then			1
" nearly every day since then , the promises that formed the heart of that sales pitch have been exposed for the false promises they were , " @entity31 said on the @entity25 floor , adding that the @entity3 decision thursday provided " powerful confirmation of what may have been the biggest deception of all			2
" he urged @entity19 to stop " trying to defend the indefensible " and join with republicans to repeal the health care law			1
health care ruling gives @entity10 new attack line meanwhile , rep. @entity47 , @entity48 , a tea party favorite and leading opponent of health care reform , said she and congressional colleagues were sending a letter to state officials urging them not to implement the health care bill until after the november vote			1
" all across job creator boardrooms today , decisions are being made by millions of employers to drop the employer covered health insurance , " @entity47 claimed friday on @entity58			2
" that 's why we 're telling the states just stop , take a breath , because we 're going to turn the economy around after november			0
" the polarizing law is the signature legislation of @entity18 's time in office , and opposition to it helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement			1
friday 's rhetoric by @entity31 and other @entity10 reflected their shock and anger at the high court decision , which rejected the challenges of opponents who contended the health care law was unconstitutional			1
breaking down the court 's decision in a 5 - 4 ruling , the court decided the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance was valid as a tax , even though it was impermissible under the @entity94 's @entity93			1
the most anticipated @entity3 ruling in years allows the government to continue implementing the health care law , which does n't take full effect until 2014			1
that means popular provisions that prohibit insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions and allow parents to keep their children on family policies to the age of 26 will continue			0
opinion : chief justice roberts : the decider however , @entity10 opponents of the law 's expansion of government vowed to continue fighting to repeal it , with certain presidential nominee @entity116 saying that defeating @entity18 in november is the only way to meet that goal			1
both presidential campaigns are citing fundraising spikes after the @entity3 's decision			2
@entity116 's organization said friday that it had raised $ 4.6 million online , and @entity18 's operation , while not revealing specific numbers , said it had surpassed that total			1
the individual mandate is the linchpin of the health care law signed by @entity18 in 2010 after an epic brawl in @entity131 in which no @entity10 supported the measure			1
@entity18 has denied that the mandate is a tax , including in a 2009 interview with @entity136 in which he compared it to state requirements that motorists carry auto insurance			1
" nobody considers that a tax increase , " @entity18 said then			1
" people say to themselves , ' that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car , that i 'm not covering all the costs			0
' " at least 4 million people are expected to pay a penalty for not having health insurance when the rule takes full effect in 2016 , bringing in about $ 54 billion to help offset the $ 1.7 trillion , 10 - year cost of the act , according to the nonpartisan @entity155			2
it 's one of several revenue - raising provisions in the health care law , according to @entity160 , a @entity161 political scientist and co-author of a 2010 book on the health care battle			1
who 's going to treat you ? under the health care law when it is fully implemented in coming years , most @entity167 will be covered by employee health plans , either their own or that of a head of household , or by existing government programs such as @entity174 , @entity175 or veterans ' benefits , @entity160 noted			1
of the roughly 6 % of the population remaining , a large portion of those will be exempted from the mandate because of poverty , religious beliefs or other reasons , he said			0
@entity186 spokesman @entity185 said friday that the fine for failing to have health insurance once the law is fully implemented is " a penalty , because you have a choice " of whether to obtain it			1
" if you do n't buy it , and you can afford it , it is an irresponsible thing to do to ask the rest of @entity167 's taxpayers to pay for your care when you go to the emergency room , " @entity185 said			2
" so your choice is to purchase health ( insurance ) , or a penalty will be administered			2
" by the numbers : health insurance @entity47 's allegation that the health care law would lead to fewer @entity167 jobs was challenged on @entity58 by @entity19 gov. @entity210 of @entity211			1
" if they 're not hiring , it 's because they do n't have demand , " @entity210 said			0
" what they care most about when they 're deciding whether to hire is where do they have access to the greatest work force			2
i mean , these charges are just ridiculous			0
" democrats also noted that @entity116 , as governor of @entity227 , implemented an individual mandate similar to the concept in the federal law			1
@entity116 contends that the @entity227 law was tailored to the state 's needs and that such a solution was improper at the federal level			1
he called the law known as @entity21 bad policy and a bad law on the federal level			2
that did n't stop @entity19 rep. @entity241 of @entity242 from noting on @entity58 that @entity116 " actually defended what he called a penalty " during his term as @entity227 governor			1
" not my words , @entity116 's words , were the free riders -- who chose not to get health insurance but shift those costs onto society -- need to pay their fair share , " @entity241 said			1
" i did n't call them free riders			0
" in thursday 's majority opinion , chief justice @entity256 wrote that " the federal government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance			2
... the federal government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance			1
" @entity256 joined the high court 's liberal wing -- justices @entity268 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 -- in upholding the law			2
read the ruling ( @entity275 ) four conservative justices -- @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 -- dissented			0
" to say that the individual mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it , " the dissenting justices wrote in their opinion			2
" imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme , and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry			0
" how the court voted an @entity296 / @entity295 poll released tuesday indicated that 37 % of @entity167 would have been pleased if the law had been found unconstitutional , compared with 28 % who would have been pleased if it had been found constitutional			0
and the poll of 1,000 @entity167 adults found that nearly four in 10 surveyed would have " mixed feelings " had the justices struck down the whole law			0
@entity18 , in televised remarks , called thursday 's @entity3 ruling a victory for the nation			1
he used the focus on the issue to spell out the benefits of the law that remains unpopular with many @entity167			0
the principle upheld by the high court 's ruling is that no @entity167 should go bankrupt because of illness , the president said			0
" i know the debate over this law has been divisive , " @entity18 said			2
" it should be pretty clear that i did n't do this because it was good politics			0
i did it because i believe it is good for the country			0
" he said the country ca n't afford " to refight the political battle of two years ago or go back to the way things were			0
" @entity331 @entity330 of @entity332 , who helped push through the law when she was @entity186 speaker , cited the late sen. @entity334 of @entity227 , a longtime proponent of health care reform who died before the bill became law			1
" now he can rest in peace , " she said , echoing what she 'd earlier told @entity279 's widow by phone			0
in his opinion , @entity256 appeared to note the political divisions , writing that " we do not consider whether the act embodies sound policies			0
" " that judgment is entrusted to the nation 's elected leaders , " the opinion said			0
" we ask only whether @entity131 has the power under the @entity94 to enact the challenged provisions			0
" the narrow focus of the ruling on key issues such as the individual mandate -- limiting it to taxing powers rather than general commerce -- represented the court 's effort to limit the government 's authority			0
" the framers created a federal government of limited powers and assigned to this court the duty of enforcing those limits , " @entity256 wrote			0
" the court does so today			0
" in another part of thursday 's decision , the high court ruled that a part of the law involving @entity175 must change			0
the law calls for an expansion of eligibility for @entity175 , which involves spending by the federal government and the states , and threatens to remove existing @entity175 funding from states that do n't participate in the expansion			0
thursday 's ruling said the government must remove that threat .			0
