-- in the wake of last week 's tragedy in @entity4 , i have been asked a million questions about gun control			0
i 've seen pictures of the weapon the killer used			0
i 've heard stories about the number of bullets in the clip and the number of guns in his mother 's home			1
i 've even heard politicians argue that school officials should be armed with semiautomatic weapons			0
i 've also heard about mental health			1
we should be careful not to blame the mentally ill for all crimes			1
but we should also be prepared to accept that we might be able to prevent some tragedies if we did a better job of caring for them			1
i 've seen mental health illness in children , and our system is ill - equipped to handle it			1
i 've seen families struggle with it			0
one of my greatest frustrations with clinical practice is that there are far too many times when i lack the tools necessary to care for children who need help			1
it 's relatively easy to cure an infection or an acute physical ailment			1
it 's so much harder to take a mental health issue			1
there are rarely pills that will do the job			1
even when they are , they almost never work perfectly to eradicate the problem			0
opinion : on gun control , two places to start studies show that more than 10 % of children in the @entity57 might benefit from some sort of mental health treatment			1
most do n't get it			0
we often do n't have the research to tell us how best to care for these problems			2
even when we do , we often lack the capacity			0
there is a shortage of resources and services available to serve children			0
furthermore , even when those resources exist , a lack of coordination often prevents they 're being used effectively			0
it does n't help that the upcoming fiscal cliff will likely cut @entity75 research funding by $ 2.4 billion			0
that would mean 2,300 fewer grants in the coming year , which represents about 25 % of grants that might otherwise be offered			2
it does n't help that we keep talking about cuts to services such as @entity84 and the @entity85 , which cover the health care for about one in every three children in the @entity57			1
if a child is actively suicidal or homicidal , an emergency room can spring into action and admit him or her for inpatient care			1
but that 's often all inpatient care will do			2
once a child is no longer actively threatening harm to himself or others , he or she will be released			0
that 's what the hospital system does			2
it cares for the acute problem , leaving the long term , and often much harder , work to a system ill - equipped to handle it			1
opinion : mourn ... and take action on guns it 's natural to try and blame poor parenting when kids do n't turn out as well as we 'd hope			1
and , certainly , in many instances such parenting can lead to a misbehaving child , or even a child we do n't necessarily like			2
but mental illness really does exist , and a lot of it ca n't be cured by good parenting and is n't caused by bad parenting			1
we do n't have a good system for dealing with it			2
i want to stress that i do n't think that all violence is associated with mental illness			1
in fact , it 's quite the opposite			0
but the problems with guns and injuries go so far beyond school shootings , and a lot of that is amenable to a more focused health care system			1
opinion : predicting mass killings impossible one of the things i do as a pediatrician is " anticipatory guidance			0
" we ask questions about issues that have not yet occurred but might occur in the future			0
a lot of anticipatory guidance focuses on injury prevention			0
we might ask about bike helmets , or swimming , or fire alarms in the house			2
i even ask about guns in the home			2
i do n't ask this question because i 'm eager to lecture patients or parents on the morality of owning guns , or the rights of individuals under the @entity166			1
i 'm asking because i 'm trying to prevent injury or death			2
the no. 3 killer of children age 10 - 14 is suicide ; the fourth is homicide			1
the no. 2 killer of children age 15 - 19 is homicide ; no. 3 is suicide			2
opinion : in school shootings , patterns and warning signs i have been trained to ask parents if they have a gun in the home			2
if they do , i ask how it 's stored			0
i strongly recommend that they keep it unloaded , locked up , and that they store the bullets separately			0
i do this because guns are part of almost 85 % of homicides and more than 45 % of suicides in kids 5 to 19 years old			1
this does n't even account for injuries not resulting in death			0
yet recent laws have attempted to stop pediatricians from doing even this			1
i do n't know what the best outcome is from a tragedy like this			0
i imagine much of the focus will be on banning the weapon used or on limiting the number of bullets that could be fired without reloading			0
i think that 's somewhat missing the point			0
the vast majority of injuries or deaths due to guns are carried out on a small scale			2
while what happened in @entity4 is a horrific occurrence , it represents the exception , not the norm , with respect to gun violence in the @entity57			0
while i welcome the opportunity for us to address the problem , i hope we focus on how we might best help all our children , not just those who make the national news			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			1

@entity235 : we might be able to prevent tragedies if we did better job treating mental illness
@entity233 says more than 10 % of kids should have mental health care , but few get it
he says emergency rooms treat acute instances , but system ill - equipped for long - term treatment
at *checkups* , he asks parents if guns are in house , but recent laws have tried to stop even this
