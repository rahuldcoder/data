@entity1 , @entity0 -- an @entity5 professor accused of gunning down her colleagues at a university last week faced criminal charges after an altercation at a @entity0 restaurant nearly eight years ago , police said wednesday			1
it was the latest incident to surface involving @entity12 , a biology professor who is charged with capital murder and three counts of attempted murder in the shootings at the @entity17 in @entity18 last week			1
police in @entity20 , @entity0 , were called to an @entity21 on march 16 , 2002 , on a report of an assault , according to a report from the @entity25			2
responding officers found a crying woman who was the alleged victim , the report said			0
the woman , identified in the report as @entity31 , told police she and her two children had been seated for breakfast			0
" soon after another family with the defendant @entity12 was seated in a booth nearby , " the report said			2
@entity31 " then asked the waitress for a booster seat for one of the children and the waitress brought one over			1
the defendant @entity12 then also asked the waitress for a booster seat but @entity12 was told by the waitress that there were no more booster seats			1
" the defendant ... then became angry that [ @entity31 ] had the last booster seat and made the comment , ' but we were here first , ' " the report said she then became loud and abusive to the woman , the report said , shouting profanity at her and at one point saying , " i am dr. @entity12			1
" @entity12 was asked to stop using profanity , but continued to verbally abuse the woman , becoming so loud that she was heard throughout the restaurant , police said			1
the @entity61 manager told police that @entity12 was acting " like a crazy person			1
" the manager asked @entity12 to leave , and @entity12 struck the other woman on the right side of her head in front of the woman 's two children , the report said			2
after she left the restaurant , the manager wrote down the license plate number of her red 1988 @entity72			0
authorities interviewed the victim and witnesses and contacted @entity12 , who said that @entity31 had been the aggressor , but her account did not match what others said about the incident			2
@entity12 was charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct , police said			1
the @entity86 district attorney recommended a year of probation and anger management classes , but @entity12 instead admitted that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute her for disorderly conduct and assault and battery and agreed not to contact @entity31 , according to court documents			1
she was put on unsupervised probation for six months , according to @entity96 , a spokesman for the @entity86 district attorney			1
@entity31 did not return a call from @entity2			0
authorities previously have said @entity12 , who is also known as @entity99 , fatally shot her brother in the family 's @entity101 , @entity0 , home in 1986			0
the shooting was ruled accidental , but authorities said tuesday that previously missing police records of the incident had been found			0
probable cause existed in 1986 to charge @entity12 with assault with a dangerous weapon , carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition , @entity108 district attorney @entity107 said in a statement			1
however , the statute of limitations on those charges has expired , as well as on a potential charge of " wanton and reckless conduct , " the lowest standard for manslaughter in @entity0 , he said			0
and in effect , the recovered documents do not contradict investigators ' conclusion at the time that the shooting was an accident , according to the statement			0
in addition , the @entity132 reported monday that @entity12 and her husband , @entity134 , were questioned in the 1993 attempted mail bombing of a @entity137 professor			2
@entity134 told @entity2 on monday that federal investigators had gathered " a dozen subjects " in the attempted bombing , but " there were never any suspects			0
never anyone charged , never anyone arrested			0
then five years later , we got a letter from the @entity147 saying , ' you are in the clear			0
' " @entity2 's @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
