" you can sleep when you 're dead , " i 've told myself while answering work email in the middle of the night			1
to combat the previous night 's loss of sleep , i 'd go to bed at 8 p.m. the next night , only to find myself wide awake at 1 a.m. the ping - pong of sleeplessness leaves me disoriented and cranky			1
i wore my crazy work hours like a badge			1
" i worked 60 hours last week , " i 'd say tiredly , but with a secret glee that this must mean that i was the best at what i was doing			1
my disregard for a healthy work / life balance showed my dedication and loyalty to work			1
this imbalance fed others in my life : how could i possibly go to the gym ? i have work to do			1
i do n't know how to fall asleep naturally			2
i 'll have a drink or two before bed to " help " me fall asleep			2
since i did n't shop for groceries on sunday because i slept all day , on tuesday , i had to order takeout			1
a year and a half ago , i returned from my second long - term assignment in @entity31 and felt pretty burnt out			1
with the help of my boss , i found a new role within my company			2
this was a role that allowed me to develop a healthy balance between doing good work and living a good life			1
so i started leaving work at 5 p.m. i worked from home on some days			1
i filled my free time with dozens of new hobbies			1
but i still was n't getting regular and consistent sleep			1
i 'd seen the news reports that said insomnia can hinder weight loss			1
but i still held on to those late nights , which were now filled with knitting and " @entity52 " reruns instead of work			1
" how could i do it all if one - third of my day was spent sleeping ? " i wondered			0
fast forward to our @entity55 kickoff weekend			0
@entity57 , corporate dietitian for @entity59 , led a nutrition workshop for our fit nation team			0
when the discussion of sleep came up , i listened even more intently as he explained the havoc that sleeplessness can wreak on our bodies , our blood sugars and our metabolism			1
i left that weekend determined to tackle my insomnia head on			0
i decided on three simple behaviors that i could change immediately : 1			0
do not drink alcohol at home i used this as a crutch to get to sleep for many years			2
but while that drink might knock you out , you 're not getting restful @entity79 sleep and a few short hours later , you 're right back where you started : awake ! 2			2
set a consistent bedtime i decided to go to bed at 10:30 every night , including the weekends			0
the first few days were weird , but by the third night , my body was used to winding itself down around 9 p.m. 3			0
no screens an hour before bedtime and no cell phone in the bedroom i spend most of my days planted in front of a computer			0
if i 'm not working , i 'm surfing the @entity91 or watching a movie online			2
my eyes and brain are constantly stimulated			0
unplugging an hour before bed allows me to have a conversation with my boyfriend without distractions			0
i read a few chapters in a good book or i knit a few more rows on my latest sock project			0
it 's been nice having this time for reflection and to quiet my mind right before bed			2
banishing the phone from the bedroom means if i roll over in the middle of the night , i simply wait for myself to fall back asleep instead of reaching for the phone and scrolling through @entity111			0
i 'm at the end of the third week and i have to tell you , i 'm now sleeping through the night ! i feel energized and excited to start the day			0
i 've got energy for workouts and cooking			0
and i look forward to bedtime each night			0
sweet dreams at last .			0
