-- the death of an @entity4 dentist who died after a miscarriage in an @entity7 hospital was the result of medical misadventure , an inquest jury ruled friday			1
@entity10 , 31 , was 17 weeks pregnant when she died in october at @entity12			1
the inquest jury heard seven days of evidence from staff and expert witnesses , as well as her widower , @entity16			1
a pathologist , professor @entity17 , told the inquest the cause of death was septic shock , @entity22 in @entity10 's bloodstream and a miscarriage			1
in his evidence , a leading obstetrician said @entity16 's life could have been saved had a termination been carried out a day or two before her miscarriage			0
however , dr. @entity30 admitted it would not have been practical under @entity7 law , which states there has to be a real and substantial risk to the mother 's life			2
the coroner , dr. @entity37 , on friday directed jurors at @entity39 to consider carefully the verdict and his recommendations , including that @entity7 's @entity42 should lay out exactly when doctors can intervene to save the life of a mother			1
the jury unanimously returned the misadventure verdict and " strongly endorsed " his recommendations			2
@entity37 told the dentist 's husband : " the whole of @entity7 has followed your story and i want , on their behalf , to offer our deepest sympathy			1

" somebody has to take responsibility for his wife 's death , he said			1
he told reporters that the way @entity67 had been treated in the hospital was " horrendous , barbaric and inhuman			1
" friday was particularly poignant as it would have been the couple 's fifth wedding anniversary , he added			0
in his evidence last week , @entity71 said that he had been told an abortion could not be done while the fetus was still alive because @entity7 is a @entity76 country			0
the couple were married in @entity4 before moving to @entity7 , where they had lived for four years before @entity67 's death			1
' system failures ' giving evidence last week , consultant dr. @entity81 , who treated @entity16 , denied saying an abortion could not be carried out " because @entity7 is a @entity76 country			0
" but she acknowledged that she felt constrained by @entity7 law , which does not permit a termination even if there is no prospect of the fetus surviving			0
@entity81 also admitted that there were " system failures " in @entity16 's care			0
for example , @entity93 had not been made aware of blood test abnormalities and an infection , she said			0
a midwife at @entity12 hospital , @entity97 , apologized in her evidence for telling @entity16 a termination would not be possible " because @entity7 is a @entity76 country			1
" she said the comment was not meant to be hurtful			0
@entity16 went into the hospital on october 21 , complaining of back pain			0
three days after the request for a termination was made , the fetus died and was removed			0
