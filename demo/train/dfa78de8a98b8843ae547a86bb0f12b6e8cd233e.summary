-- " what we have done is kicked this can down the road			0
we are now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick it any further			0
... we have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch , not someone else 's			0
" so said president - elect @entity14 at a @entity16 editorial board meeting in january 2009 , just days before taking his first oath of office			1
he was talking about the importance of dealing with the long - term deficit and debt			1
the rhetoric has n't met the record -- debt has exploded under @entity14 's watch			1
reasonable people can forgive the president for expenses incurred while confronting the worst financial crisis since the @entity31 -- and , let 's be honest , alternative paths of austerity have not worked that well across the @entity33			2
but now is the time to get serious about reigning in our long - term debt , which now exceeds an unsustainable 70 % of gross domestic product			1
at this moment of maximum political capital , @entity14 is perfectly positioned to act on his original impulse in the @entity41 on tuesday night			1
but there is a dangerous bit of hubris sweeping the @entity45 , which says that dealing with deficits and debt is a sucker 's bet , best left to the next @entity51 president			1
instead , the @entity52 are riding high and arguing that deficit and debt is not a primary concern to most voters and irrelevant to economic growth			1
and so the pregame expectation setting comes : @entity60 minions told the @entity16 not to expect the president to present " an ambitious new plan to rein in the debt " in the @entity41			1
opinion : @entity14 needs to lay out a plan on climate crisis this would be a major mistake and a costly lost opportunity			1
with an eye toward his legacy , @entity14 should follow his original instincts and put the power of presidency behind a balanced long - term plan to deal with deficits and debt -- including spending cuts , tax reform and , most importantly , entitlement reform			1
this is the time for @entity14 to pull a @entity82 in @entity83			1
just as only a committed anti-communist such as @entity82 could establish relations with communist @entity83 , @entity14 is perfectly positioned to do what he knows is necessary to preserve the long - term strength and solvency of the social safety net : @entity91 and @entity92			1
this does not mean draconian cuts or a voucherization of the existing system as imagined by rep. @entity97 and many @entity98			2
but it does mean following through on the president 's previous negotiated offers to consider " chained @entity103 , " which would lower inflation - related increases in @entity92 benefits , and to raise the eligibility age for @entity91			1
@entity107 adjustments such as these can save billions of dollars over the next 10 years , keeping these popular programs solvent			0
other solutions , such as raising the @entity92 payroll tax cap to more than the current income cutoff of $ 110,000 , are worth consideration as part of a package			0
this is an idea that liberals love because it extends the progressivity of the tax code to the wealthiest @entity121			0
alternatively , we could means - test @entity92 to make sure it serves primarily as a safety net -- or ( gasp ! ) raise the retirement age			0
when the @entity126 suggested raising the retirement age to 69 in 2075 , it was met with howls of outrage from unions in particular			0
this makes no sense , especially if common - sense exemptions are made for manual labor			0
beltway cynics say that the bipartisan deficit and debt reduction plans that are often cited have no chance of passing @entity139			1
when you look at the pathetic support for @entity126 when it was actually put to a vote in the @entity60 last march -- 16 republicans and 22 @entity45 supported it -- you see why cynicism is always a safe bet in @entity148			0
but take a step back , and you 'll see much broader support among the @entity121 people			0
the @entity153 found that the top three issues are " strengthening the economy " ( at 86 % ) , " improving the jobs situation " ( 79 % ) and " reducing the budget deficit " ( at 72 % )			2
crucially , the deficit has shown the biggest increase as an issue over the past four years -- up 19 percentage points from 2009			0
this is evidence of a pent - up demand for action -- but it will require presidential leadership			2
of course the devil is in the details , and politicos will point out that when confronted with tough medicine to deal with deficits and debt , even alleged @entity174 supporters balk ( hence the classic " @entity178 ! " sign that i saw at one 2009 rally )			2
but strengthening @entity121 to remain competitive in the 21st century will require getting our long - term debt under control along with other important but less poll - prioritized policies such as comprehensive immigration reform and a public - private infrastructure bank to fund nation - building " here at home			2
" the @entity41 is a chance for the president to put forward a balanced bipartisan solution that contrasts with radical conservatives who believe that increased tax revenues from closed tax loopholes ca n't be part of a big deal to bring down our debt			1
@entity199 lawyers will fight to protect every loophole they embedded in our tax code , but their argument does n't begin to make sense to people on @entity206			0
@entity14 will probably point out tuesday night that economic growth is the essential x factor to reducing long - term deficits and debt			1
on this point at least , he and some conservatives might agree			0
but dumb meat cleaver cuts such as the looming sequestration could push our economy back into recession			2
that 's why a smart balanced alternative plan is necessary			0
but it will require presidential leadership and putting some @entity45 sacred cows on the table			0
this does n't just make practical sense in a divided government ( a reality some @entity45 seem to forget ) -- it makes compelling political sense as well			0
by seizing the mantle of fiscal responsibility -- in contrast to fiscal conservatism -- @entity14 will build on his post-election bump among centrists and some independents			2
the more machiavellian @entity45 might argue that this outreach could only serve to isolate @entity98 more			0
nonpartisan strategists might argue that this approach would drive a wedge between reasonable republicans and the @entity60 radicals			0
but the real reason for @entity14 to address the need to reduce long - term deficits and debt directly is because it 's the right thing to do for our country -- and he is uniquely positioned to achieve it			1
just as @entity82 could go to @entity83 , a @entity249 such as @entity250 was needed to pass civil rights legislation and @entity252 was able to sign welfare reform after decades of @entity98 talking about it , @entity14 can put our country on a balanced path of long - term economic growth and fiscal responsibility			1
bottom line : @entity14 has the political opportunity , but does he have the political will ? we 'll all find out in real time if he decides to lead on this issue or just be the latest in a long line to kick the can further down the road			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267 .			2

@entity267 : president @entity14 is well - positioned to help solve debt problem
he says @entity14 should avoid *temptation* favored by some *democrats* to put off action
relatively modest changes in entitlements could help ensure their *survival* , @entity267 says
@entity267 : @entity14 can rally his party behind deficit cuts that wo n't hurt economy
