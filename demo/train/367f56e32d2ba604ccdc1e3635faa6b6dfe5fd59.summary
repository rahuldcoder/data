-- it 's no bloody , foot - stomping battle to the death , but a legal fight befitting a mighty dinosaur is playing out on two continents as @entity7 's president tries to block the sale of a nearly complete skeleton of a 24 - foot - long dinosaur that roamed @entity11 80 million years ago			1
despite a @entity14 judge 's order barring the sale at the behest of @entity7 president @entity17 , a @entity19 - based auction house on sunday unloaded the rare skeleton of a @entity21 -- also known as @entity21 -- to an undisclosed buyer for $ 1,052,500 at an auction in @entity24			1
an attorney for @entity7 tried to stop the sale , standing up and waving a cell phone with the @entity14 judge waiting on the other side , but auction officials declined to stop the sale and escorted the lawyer outside			1
" this is a once - in - a - generation dinosaur and collectors definitely responded to both its rarity and its fierce beauty , " @entity33 of @entity34 said in a statement after the sale			0
" a dino like this is rare to come across in any condition , let alone one as pristine as this			0
" the dispute is the latest in a series of battles between national governments and private collectors over cultural artifacts , including rare fossils			0
governments such as @entity7 's are concerned about maintaining control over fossil and cultural relics while scientists worry about such items disappearing into private collections			1
" at stake are the heritage , history and culture of a sovereign nation , " attorneys for @entity17 said in a filing asking for the restraining order			0
@entity17 had sought to stop the auction , saying it would be illegal to sell the fossil if it had been recovered from his country			1
while @entity34 did n't say where the fossil had been unearthed , paleontologist @entity72 of @entity73 said it is almost certainly @entity7			1
most if not all of the examples of the species recovered so far have come from a single geological formation in @entity7 called the @entity79			1
" from what any of us can tell from the photographs on the auction site , the specimen is a typical @entity85 from @entity7 , " he said			2
although @entity34 went ahead with the sale , it is describing it as contingent on a resolution of the @entity14 court case			1
" we respect the various opinions on the subject and wish to protect the legal rights of all parties involved , " @entity34 president @entity34 said in a statement sunday			2
" we have legal assurances from our reputable consignors that the specimen was obtained legally			0
as far as we know , the @entity7 government has not produced any evidence that the piece originated in its territory , but the final determination will be up to the @entity107 legal system , " he said			2
in legal filings , @entity17 's attorneys cited media reports in which @entity33 was quoted as saying the skeleton had been recovered in the @entity112 , a part of which lies within @entity7			1
the filing also cited dinosaur experts who believe the specimen , which is 75 % complete , probably came from @entity7			2
it had been stored in @entity119 until it was brought to the @entity120 last year , according to @entity34			0
tarbosaurus bataar was similar to , but slightly smaller than , the better - known @entity122			1
like its @entity107 counterpart , the dinosaur was a dominant carnivore that lived in the @entity127 period			0
while the auction house referred to it as a tyrannosaurus , most scientists consider the name @entity85 to now be correct , @entity72 said			0
while separate species , the two were " very closely related , " he said			0
many paleontologists disapprove of the sale of fossils , saying museums are often unable to afford the frequently high prices at auction , according to the @entity141			2
the group also says that placing important specimens in private collections beyond the reach of researchers and the public could harm scientific inquiry and dampen the enthusiasm of children to pursue careers in science .			0

new : auctioned fossil is almost certainly from @entity7 , paleontologist says
sunday 's $ 1 million sale of a tarbosaurus bataar skeleton is contingent on court case
