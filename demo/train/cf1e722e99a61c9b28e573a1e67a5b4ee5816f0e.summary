@entity0 -- @entity2 passed a milestone in its efforts to clear its foreign debts after announcing agreements with the @entity7 of creditors , the @entity9 , and the @entity10			1
the deals announced sunday mean that @entity2 has now cleared the bulk of its $ 11.3bn in outstanding foreign debts			1
resolving the debts , which the government stopped servicing in the 1980s , is seen as a crucial step in the country 's efforts to re-engage with international donors			0
the @entity9 and the @entity10 said their boards had agreed to clear @entity2 's arrears of a combined $ 960m using bridge loans from the @entity24			1
the moves funded by @entity26 followed @entity28 's unilateral decision to settle nearly $ 6.6bn in bilateral debt and a subsequent move by @entity31 to clear some $ 600m in debt			1
the @entity7 agreement , to cancel at least 50 per cent of a further $ 4.4bn in bilateral debt , will meanwhile enable @entity2 to start negotiations with nine creditor countries on repayment terms			1
@entity2 , which has promised a series of rapid political and economic reforms under president @entity39 , has made clearing its debts a priority			0
but there are concerns among some diplomats that the debt deals could prompt further criticism of the @entity2 military 's escalating attacks on northern ethnic @entity50 rebels			0
in recent weeks , the @entity51 , the @entity52 and the @entity53 have all urged an end to the fighting , and some western politicians and officials have warned that further conflict could endanger aid plans for @entity2			0
the most significant breakthrough in terms of @entity2 's remaining debt to creditor countries came after an intense 19 - hour negotiating session between @entity2 and the @entity7 group of creditor countries in @entity67 late last week			1
the @entity7 is an informal group of creditor countries that consult regularly on issues including loan restructuring and debt cancellation , particularly for heavily indebted poor countries			0
@entity2 owed about $ 4.4bn to nine @entity7 countries including the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and the @entity78			1
under @entity7 rules , a debtor country must first clear its arrears with international financial institutions before it can negotiate with creditor countries			0
" it was a very tough negotiation , but @entity2 got a good , in some respects exceptional , agreement -- this has really opened a new era for us , " said @entity84 , a leading @entity2 economist who was part of the negotiating team in @entity67			0
the government has high hopes for more leniency from creditors following the @entity7 talks , he noted			0
" @entity28 and @entity31 's moves were vital in helping the @entity7 reach a relatively quick agreement , but the international financial institutions were crucial in convincing creditors that our reforms are genuine and are proceeding , " he said , noting that such a move would normally have required a formal @entity101 programme			2
" @entity2 has come a long way in its economic transformation " and the debt deals should help attract investment , spur growth and create jobs , said @entity108 , the @entity9 's country director , though she warned " much work remains to be done "			2
in its most recent assessment , the @entity9 said @entity2 's economic growth accelerated to 5.5 per cent in fiscal year 2011 - 12 and is expected to reach 6.3 per cent in 2012 - 13			2
