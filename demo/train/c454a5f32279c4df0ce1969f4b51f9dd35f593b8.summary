those two @entity1 buildings where eight people died in an explosion were served by a very old gas main -- 127 years old to be exact			1
it 's the latest incident in what experts warn is a dangerous trend plaguing the nation 's oldest cities : natural gas leaks and aging infrastructure			2
" gas explosions are happening way too frequently , " said @entity13 , president of @entity15 - based @entity14 and the @entity16			1
" it 's an epidemic			0
" the cause of wednesday 's explosion in @entity21 , which injured dozens and destroyed the five - story buildings , has not been determined officially			1
but tests taken of the soil in the area in the hours after the explosion found natural gas at levels as high as 20 % when none should have been present , federal investigators said			2
" it almost confirms you had a gas leak out there , and the building exploded , " @entity13 told @entity32			2
" that means we can be 99 % sure this was caused by a gas explosion			2
" @entity41 of the @entity42 , which is investigating the blast , said the readings indicated natural gas might have triggered the explosion that shook the bustling neighborhood			2
the soil readings " further lead to the hypothesis that this may well have been a natural gas leak , " @entity41 told reporters			2
" we would expect to find zero concentration of natural gas in the soil , so it would indicate that at least somehow or another natural gas did work its way into the ground			2
" some urban gas lines : antiquated and hard to reach the blast comes as many @entity62 utilities struggle to maintain or replace antiquated , hard - to - reach and leaky gas mains in older urban areas , according to experts			1
the most vulnerable mains are made of cast iron or steel			2
a day before the explosion , the @entity1 - based @entity69 said in a report that @entity1 's aging infrastructure " could wreak havoc on the city 's economy and quality of life			2
" an estimated $ 47.3 billion would have to be devoted for repairs to maintain safety			1
" the average age of @entity1 's 6,400 miles of sewage mains is approximately 84 years , for example , " wrote the report 's author , @entity79			2
" its 6,800 miles of water mains are approximately 69 years old , and its 6,300 miles of gas mains are 56 years old			1
" leaks cause the city 's top utility company , @entity88 , to lose more than 2 % of the gas it delivers to customers each year , according to the report			1
additionally , 60 % of @entity1 gas mains are made of unprotected steel or cast iron , which are prone to leaks and no longer used by main manufacturers			1
@entity88 manages one of the oldest gas distribution networks in the country , the report said			2
the utility 's 2,234 miles of gas mains , which serve 833,000 customers in the @entity106 , @entity107 and northern @entity108 , are 53 years old on average			1
citing the federal @entity111 , the report said @entity88 experienced 83 leaks for every 100 miles of main in 2012			0
corrosion was responsible for 427 of those leaks			0
in @entity21 , the gas pipe serving the collapsed buildings included a cast iron section dating from 1887 , city officials said			1
a cold and dangerous trap " @entity120 and frost do n't mix well , " @entity13 said			0
@entity88 officials said the utility received a call reporting a gas leak around 9:13 a.m. wednesday from a resident at one of the newer buildings on @entity129			1
the utility dispatched a truck two minutes later , but it arrived after the explosion			0
the caller , as well as other residents on the block , reported smelling gas the night before but did not call the utility at the time			0
@entity13 and other experts said underground pipes are a major source of gas leaks , with the escaping gas typically traveling through the soil and dissipating into the air			0
during winter , however , soil is hardened by frost , which traps the gas and causes it to travel sideways			0
with warmer weather , the frost thaws and the soil contracts			0
@entity152 movements caused by construction work or other environmental factors can also cause pipes to crack			0
" that expansion and contraction can heave the cast iron pipes up , down , left , right , " @entity13 said			0
" being old does n't help , obviously			0
but cast iron is a very fragile material when you bend it or displace it ... if a leaky main is close to a building , about 4 or 5 feet away , the gas can work its way into a building			1
" the future is in plastic @entity88 and other utilities around the nation have stepped up efforts to replace cast iron pipelines with plastic ones			1
the utility is replacing an average of 65 miles of gas mains each year , for the next three years , at a cost of approximately $ 110 million , @entity88 spokesman @entity175 said			1
in addition , the company spends about $ 500 million a year maintaining and upgrading the natural gas infrastructure			1
" age alone does not tell you about the condition of the pipe , " @entity183 said in a statement			0
" cast iron pipes can be used for hundreds of years if the underpinning and the environment around the pipes is sound			0
" still , experts said , the old iron pipes beneath many @entity62 cities are too vulnerable			1
" gas companies have been very lucky over the years to not have this happen more , " @entity196 , a natural gas consultant who runs @entity200 - based @entity199 , said of the @entity21 explosion			1
" for every gas company across the northern part of this country , whether it 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 or @entity209 ... this is a critical time			0
they have hundreds of broken mains going on around the country now , and they are lucky to catch most			0
" the aging infrastructure of cities such as @entity1 , @entity15 , @entity220 and @entity206 make them especially susceptible to leaks and explosions , experts said			0
in january , a study published by researchers at @entity225 and @entity226 detected 5,893 leaks of methane , the main component of natural gas , rising from the streets of @entity232			1
at 12 of the tested locations , the study found " potentially explosive " concentrations of underground methane -- about 10 times greater than the threshold at which explosions can occur			0
" i see the industry slipping in my opinion in terms of vigilance and protecting the public , " @entity13 said			0
" it comes down to what can we cut , what can we avoid doing ? " the @entity62 @entity247 estimates that more than 30,000 miles of cast iron pipe are still being used to deliver gas throughout the nation			1
the highest percentage of cast - iron mains are in @entity220 , @entity232 , @entity15 and @entity1			1
" let 's hope gas operators get through this winter without another incident , " @entity196 said			0
" @entity88 and other national gas companies are really nervous right now			0

buildings where eight in @entity21 died were served by a 127 - year - old gas main
