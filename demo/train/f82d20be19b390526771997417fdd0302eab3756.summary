" i strongly reject threats by any member state to destroy another or outrageous attempts to deny historical facts , such as the @entity6 , " he said , speaking in @entity12 's home turf			2
" claiming that another @entity2 member state , @entity4 , does not have the right to exist , or describing it in racist terms , is not only utterly wrong but undermines the very principles we have all pledged to uphold			1

" i urge all ( @entity9 ) members to work within the principles of the @entity41 to resolve disputes peacefully , " @entity38 said			2
" but it is not sufficient to focus on lowering tensions between ( @entity9 ) countries , as important as that is			0
we must prevent conflict between all @entity2 member states			0
" @entity38 had been discouraged by the @entity50 from attending the meeting , seen as a propaganda stage for the @entity7 regime			2
but the secretary - general says the @entity2 has a " close history " and shared principles with @entity9 , made up of nations that claim not to be aligned with any world power			0
" assuming the leadership of the @entity9 provides @entity7 with the opportunity to demonstrate that it can play a moderate and constructive role internationally			0
that includes responsible action on the nuclear program which is among the top concerns of the international community , " @entity38 said			1
@entity7 's nuclear aspirations have been a top issue for the @entity50 and other @entity70 nations			0

" on the basis of international laws , peaceful use of nuclear energy is a right of every country			1
" while defending his nation 's nuclear program , @entity89 took jabs at the @entity50			1
" a bitter irony of our era is that the @entity50 government , which possesses the largest and deadliest stockpiles of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction and the only country guilty of its use , is today eager to carry the banner of opposition to nuclear proliferation , " he said			2
