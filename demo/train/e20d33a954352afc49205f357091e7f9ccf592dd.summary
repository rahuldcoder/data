@entity0 -- an @entity3 cobra that drew thousands of @entity5 fans has been found alive after it went missing for days from a @entity0 zoo			1

@entity7 said the cobra had sought a secure hiding spot within the holding areas of the zoo 's reptile house -- a complex environment with pumps , motors and other mechanical systems			1
but it was lured out after zoo officials sprinkled wood shavings from exhibit beds across areas where they guessed the cobra was hiding			1
" it was the scent of rodents ( on the wood clippings ) that we hoped would bring her out , " @entity7 added			2
" the key strategy here was patience , " he said in a prepared statement			2
the snake went missing saturday from an off - exhibit enclosure , prompting the zoo to close the reptile house			1
officials had earlier cautioned that it might take days or even weeks before the snake was found , and urged the public not to panic , saying the cobra was likely contained within the building			1
while the mystery of the missing snake may have caused concern for zoo - goers , it also earned a cult following online			1
after launching on monday , the anonymous @ @entity5 feed had amassed nearly 200,000 followers by 6 p.m. thursday			2
the feed had given the snake a hilarious shtick by toying a bit with the fears of skittish @entity0			2
