@entity9 , 35 , was the only defendant found guilty of all four conspiracy charges			0
the six suspects were arrested in june 2006 for allegedly conspiring to blow up buildings , including the 110 - story @entity14 , the nation 's tallest building , in @entity17 , @entity18 ; the @entity20 's @entity0 office and others			2
the suspected ringleader , @entity9 , 35 , was the only defendant found guilty of all four conspiracy charges , including conspiring to incite a rebellion against the @entity25 , supplying materials to a terror organization and terrorists , and conspiring to destroy buildings with explosives			0
another defendant , @entity31 , 29 , was convicted of two counts involving supplying materials to terrorists and terror groups , and of conspiring to destroy buildings with explosives			1
@entity37 , 33 , @entity31 , 24 , and @entity31 , 25 , were convicted of supplying materials to terrorists , but acquitted of the other charges			1
the sixth defendant , @entity40 , 25 , was acquitted on all four counts			0
" the jury has spoken , " @entity31 's attorney , @entity42 , told @entity2 after the verdicts			1
" and we anxiously await our day in the court of appeals			0
" @entity48 , attorney for @entity31 , indicated his client would also appeal , saying , " the fight has only just begun			1
" the terror trial in @entity0 was the third held for the defendants			1
juries have twice deadlocked on verdicts for the group of homeless men initially known as the " @entity58 7 , " for the @entity0 neighborhood where authorities say they operated			1
in the first trial , a mistrial was declared after nine days of deliberations in december 2007 , although a seventh defendant was acquitted			2
the jury in the second trial deadlocked in april 2008 after deliberating for 13 days			2
a sticking point for the first two juries was whether the defendants were actually seriously plotting with @entity6 as the prosecutors alleged or if they were simply struggling young men who were looking to con an @entity20 informant out of money , as the defense alleged			1
authorities have said the men did not have explosives or weapons and that their plans appeared " more aspirational than operational			0
" the investigation began after an @entity82 speaker contacted authorities , saying that @entity9 approached him about waging " jihad " in the @entity25			0
investigators then planted among the group an undercover informant , who claimed to be an @entity6 member who helped plan the attack on the @entity91 in 2000			2

on a surveillance videotape played during trial , @entity9 could be heard saying he was " very grateful " to @entity108 and " loved " the @entity6 leader 's work			1
he also said he respected @entity108 and wanted to meet him someday			0
