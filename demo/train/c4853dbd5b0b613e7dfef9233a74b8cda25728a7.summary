-- four young boys died wednesday after the @entity3 beach where they were playing was attacked by @entity5 forces			1
a pair of explosions in what had been nine days of relentless bombings between the two countries are to blame			2
the boys had been told to stay indoors			1
and as children tend to do , they disobeyed their parents to play on the beach where they had always been safe before			1
but there is no such thing as safe when enemy fire lands across your border for more than a week			2
they were too young to know that being a civilian provides no cover from an explosion			0
that war has no clean lines			1
this is why , as our hearts weep over the death of these innocent children -- some as young as 9 -- it would be good for us to take this time to reconsider our own fantasies about the supposed clean lines of the military strikes our own country launches			1
the @entity37 may be justified in attacking an enemy ( just as @entity5 is justified in protecting itself and its children ) but it does n't always just hurt its enemies			1
the @entity37 has killed its share of little boys on the beach as well , so let us look at the photos from @entity3 and remember : sometimes we 're @entity5			1
it 's an uncomfortable thought			0
as a public we prefer to talk about military strikes more than we like to see what happens because of them			0
the hardest part about being an @entity37 citizen of the world is banishing our willful blindness			1
intuitively we know innocents die by @entity37 hands			1
but to sleep better at night , we choose not to see the ugliness that goes into " protecting @entity37 interests " or keeping our gas cheap			1
to hold the president and @entity61 accountable for the military action they authorize on our behalf requires us to care			0
and caring that much can be exhausting			0
i find myself wondering : how many children have we left face down in the sand in my lifetime ? in 2002 , a @entity37 helicopter mistakenly bombed a house full of wedding guests in @entity73 , killing more than 30 , including children			1
the @entity75 reported one little girl , @entity76 , was brought to the hospital still wearing her party dress			0
her entire family had been killed in the attack			1
this is what war looks like -- still			1
the world 's weaponry is more sophisticated but the carnage has n't changed			2
just our willingness to see it			0
there are times in which military strikes can not be avoided and in those times we should mourn			0
families will lose loved ones			0
children will one day go outside to play and they may never come home			0
it 's not just the @entity37 and its allies whose military strikes end up hitting children			1
in @entity102 two dozen children were killed when bombs fell on their elementary school in april			2
the @entity107 says , in fact , that some 10,000 children have been killed in that country 's civil war			1
yesterday four young boys , all cousins , none older than 11 , went outside to play hide and seek on a beach in @entity3			1
now their parents are having funerals			0
one boy had part of his leg blown off and was severely burned , according to the @entity118			0
nearby a smaller one with curly hair laid motionless in the sand			0
when you look at the pictures from this tragedy -- the beautiful blue water , waves in the distance racing to shore -- one can only imagine what a wonderful day it must 've been for them			0
this , too , is war			2
and i must remember not to allow proximity to dictate my reaction to the loss of life , especially life so young			1
when our newspapers and televisions were flooded with horrific images from the @entity146 , we responded passionately			0
we do n't show the gruesome images and dead bodies like that anymore , and culturally we have grown apathetic			0
politicians mock diplomacy or talk about airstrikes in the same tones in which you ask your spouse to pick up milk from the store			2
we must remember @entity76 , think about the four little boys on the beach , consider the countless other children whose blood still stains our well - meaning but sometimes clumsy hands			1
the photo of a man carrying a lifeless young body through the sand struck a nerve for many of us around the country			0
i pray going forward that visceral response continues to be the country 's reaction whenever we hear talk of war from our politicians			1
in war there are no clean lines			2
there are no safe beaches to play on			0
in 2012 , a @entity185 sergeant walked more than a mile from his base late one night and killed 16 unarmed @entity73 , nine of them children , in their homes			2
his attorney said the officer suffered a mental breakdown while serving the last of his four deployments to @entity192 and @entity73			0
he was sentenced to life in prison while the victim 's families serve out a different kind of life sentence			2
this is all part of war			2
and it 's as horrible as it sounds .			0

@entity204 : 4 boys killed while playing on @entity3 beach attacked by @entity5 forces
@entity209 : we weep , but should consider : @entity37 has **inflicted** this kind of *collateral* damage , too
he says we tend not to feel responsible for distant carnage **inflicted** for @entity37 interests
@entity209 : we should remember our visceral reaction today next time our politicians beat war drums
