-- as @entity2 struggles to come to terms with its greatest loss of life in decades , all eyes are on the man charged in the explosion in central @entity9 and the deadly shooting rampage at a youth camp			1
while police have not officially named him , @entity2 television and newspaper reports have identified the suspect as 32 - year - old @entity18			1
a rambling 1,518 - page manifesto purportedly written by someone using that name offered a rationale and action plan for terror attacks like those inflicted on @entity2 last week			1
there are clear pictures of what @entity18 looks like , at least , via images showing him with blond hair , blue - green eyes and chiseled features			1
in some cases , he 's wearing seemingly preppy clothes , though in others he strikes a far more militaristic stance			0
and the suspect will " explain himself " in court on monday , attorney @entity39 -- who claimed to represent @entity18 -- told @entity2 's @entity40 late saturday			1
yet even with these photos , even with the voluminous text in his manifesto , even if he does detail his reasoning monday , troubling questions are likely to remain			1
chief among them is how and why a native @entity2 turned on his countrymen			1
what is known is that @entity18 is a member of the @entity54 and has three weapons registered in his name , according to leading @entity2 newspaper @entity57 , which cited @entity2 's official weapons register			1
they are a glock pistol , a rifle and a shotgun , @entity57 reported			0
@entity18 is registered as having run a company that produced " vegetables , melons , roots and tubers " -- an industry which allows access to large amounts of fertilizer that can be used for explosives -- according to state - run broadcaster @entity64			2
an employee at a @entity2 agricultural cooperative told @entity0 that the man identified in media reports as the suspect in last friday 's attacks bought six tons of fertilizer from her company in may			1
@entity82 , of @entity83 , said she did not think the order was strange at the time because the suspect has a farm , but after the @entity9 attack she called police because she knew the material can be used to make bombs			1
@entity64 also reported that @entity18 does not have a military background and , in fact , was exempt from @entity2 's mandatory military service			1
he has not had any special military training , it adds on its website			0
he was a youth and adult member of the conservative @entity98 ( @entity98 ) or @entity98 , @entity57 newspaper reports , remaining involved until 2007			1
the party 's most prominent manifesto pledge is to minimize immigration			1
his membership was confirmed by a senior party member , @entity104 , who is quoted by @entity57 as saying that encountering @entity18 was " like meeting @entity105 before @entity106 " in the manifesto , which police said was posted online the day of the attacks , a writer claiming to be @entity18 writes positively of the @entity98 , calling it " the only major political party in @entity2 that has voiced any serious opposition to the madness of @entity116 immigration			1
" but he only , effusively claims membership as a " @entity118 " in what he calls the pan-european " conservative revolutionary movements in @entity121			2
" the philosophy presented in the document -- which also serves as part diatribe , part confessional and part action plan -- targets so - called " cultural @entity129 / multicultural ideals			1
" the writer makes clear that he not only opposes multiculturalism in @entity121 , including any increase in the number of in immigrants or @entity116 , but that he has thought out how to use violence to combat it			0
the manifesto and a related video are titled " 2083 : a @entity140 @entity145 , " a date that the author later explains is the year he believes a @entity140 civil war will end with the execution of what he calls " cultural marxists			1
" this " civil war " would come in three phases , he predicts			0
the first runs through 2030 and includes " open source warfare , military shock attacks by clandestine cell systems ( and ) further consolidation of conservative forces			2
" between 2030 and 2070 , he calls for " more advanced forms of resistance groups ( and the ) preparation of pan-european coup d'etats			0
" the final stage features the deposition of @entity121 's leadership and " implementation of a cultural conservative political agenda			1
" a vitriolic hatred of outside forces , and desire to oust them from @entity121 , pervades the document			0
but it especially targets @entity116 , culminating in 2083 with their deportation from the continent			0
such animosity is consistent with a post in @entity18 's name on an online forum , @entity176 , from december 2009 , talks about @entity178 teenagers being " in an especially precarious situation with regards to being harassed by @entity182 youth			0
" " i know of many hundred occasions where non-muslims have been robbed , beaten up and harassed by @entity182 gangs , " the post reads			0
" i had a best friend between the ages of 12 - 17 who was a @entity191 , so i was one of the many protected , cool ' potatoes ' that had protection			2
but this also made me see the hypocrisy up close and personal and made me nauseous			0
" such @entity197 sentiment is nothing new in @entity2 or other @entity140 nations , where there has been resistance against increasing numbers of @entity116 and their practices			2
about 3 % of @entity2 's population in 2010 -- 144,000 people -- were @entity116 , but that was expected to more than double to 6.5 % over the next 20 years , according to a report released earlier this year by @entity209			1
that is one of the largest percentage increases in @entity116 populations across all of @entity121 , thanks in part to fertility rates significantly higher than those of non-muslims			0
another post in @entity18 's name in october 2009 advises " @entity222 " , described as the founder of @entity176 , to " develop an alternative to the violent extreme @entity2 @entity129 organisations @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 " -- all left - wing movements in @entity2			1
" the conservatives dare not openly express their viewpoints in public because they know that the extreme @entity233 will trump them			0
we can not accept the fact that the @entity236 is subsidising these violent " @entity237 , who are systematically terrorising the politically conservative , " the post reads			2
he is making a reference to the youth movement of prime minister @entity242 , who heads the @entity236			0
the manifesto 's author does not telegraph his plan for july 22 , even as he extensively delves into bomb - making techniques , evading authorities and his long - range military ambitions			2
but he is sharply critical of leadership of @entity2 , with last week 's attacks targeting government buildings and a youth camp run by the ruling @entity236 , blaming them for embracing ideals that allowed the " @entity254 of @entity121			2
" the writer states he was moved to action in 1999 by " my government 's involvement " in @entity260 's strikes during the @entity262 campaign , claiming this campaign wrongly targeted " our @entity265 brothers ( who ) wanted to drive @entity182 out by deporting the @entity266 @entity116 back to @entity266			0
" he also criticizes " my government 's cowardly handling of the @entity270 cartoon issue " -- a reference to the @entity2 government 's apology for the nation 's private newspapers having repeatedly published the controversial cartoon			2
another reference blasts @entity2 , home of the @entity279 awards , for awarding a peace prize to late @entity282 leader @entity281			2
speaking in both specific and general terms , the manifesto 's author does n't hide his militant expertise or aims			0
but it is only near the end of the document that he appears willing to take matters into his own hands , citing " the old saying , ' if you want something done , then do it yourself			0
' " acting national police chief @entity295 told reporters sunday said that the suspect , arrested on @entity298 after gunning down at least 86 people there after killing at least seven in the @entity9 bombing , insisted he acted alone			1
police still say , though , that they have n't ruled out others may not have been involved , and the manifesto does allude to like - minded right - wing revolutionaries			1
that said , the document 's author does predict " all my friends and family ( will ) detest me and call me a monster , " and that media will " have their hands full figuring out multiple ways to character assassinate , vilify and demonize			0
" but ultimately , he writes that he believes he and other revolutionaries will be remembered fondly , part of his rallying cry for " the emerging @entity140 conservative resistance movement			0
" " your name will be remembered for centuries , " the document states			0
" you will forever be celebrated by your people as a martyr for your country , protecting your culture and fighting for your kin and for @entity332			0
" @entity0 's @entity333 and @entity334 contributed to this report .			0

the 32 - year - old suspect insists he acted alone , the national police chief says
a manifesto purportedly by him details his @entity343 , *anti-immigrant* philosophy
the head of a conservative party says she is *horrified* that this man is a former member
