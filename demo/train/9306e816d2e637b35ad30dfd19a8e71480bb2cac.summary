@entity11 striker @entity1 is still hoping @entity5 will offer him a new deal at the end of the month			1
@entity11 international striker @entity1 is clearly frustrated at @entity5 manager @entity14 's failure to open talks regarding a permanent transfer to the defending @entity18 finalists			1
on sunday @entity1 ran in the direction of @entity14 and @entity5 chief executive @entity20 and cupped his hands to his ears after scoring in the 2 - 0 win over @entity24 that left the club on the brink of another @entity6 title			1

there are interested clubs from all those countries			2
" he already said he would like to stay in the @entity6 because he likes football in the country , so he fortunately will decide where he will play			2
he is lucky to have the chance to choose			0
" @entity33 said : " there was no will from the directors and the coach to sign a new contract			0
on may 31 , he will have no club and no contract			0
i do n't know why , but @entity50 ( @entity5 ) have not asked for any renewal ( of the loan ) nor signing him for next season			2
" he added : " the directors and the coach do not seem to want him , while on the other hand fans love him			0
" however , @entity1 's adviser @entity57 stressed the striker would not rush to a decision over his future before the season ends			1
