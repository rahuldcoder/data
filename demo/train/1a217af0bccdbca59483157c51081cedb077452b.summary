-- it 's been described as one of the greatest victorian gothic horror stories of all time			0
two ships with 129 men on board and fitted with the latest technology , vanish with barely a trace left behind			1
one hundred and sixty years of searching -- one attempt as recent as last month -- have failed to find " @entity11 " and her sister ship , the somewhat appropriately named " @entity14 " -- the two vessels lost in the @entity16			1
in 1845 @entity19 @entity18 captain sir @entity17 set out with some of the finest sailors of the time on a mission to map the @entity22			1
@entity17 's expedition was n't the first to the region , but it is the most infamous			1
" why did this fail when all the others did n't , " asks author @entity26			0
" there was something jinxed about the expedition			1
" @entity26 is one of many to be transfixed by the mystery of @entity17 's last voyage			1
" we love adventure stories , of derring - do , win against all odds , but in this story they do n't and we still do n't know why			0
" the environment of the @entity22 is unforgiving			1
the landscape is vast and deserted , comparable only to @entity43 's moons			0
the winters are unrelenting and bleak			0
@entity17 's men were faced with particularly brutally harsh temperatures and blizzards when they reached the region			1
despite the ships being reinforced with steel and holding three years worth or provisions , it appears the environment got the better of the crew			1
" man proposes , @entity60 disposes , " says @entity55 from the @entity56 , who regularly visits the region			0
' " and the ice gods are a fickle lot			0
" the disappearance of the @entity11 and the @entity14 has prompted the longest search mission in history : although there have been numerous attempts to find the ships , there has been no sign of them			1
@entity72 from @entity73 led the most recent mission to try to locate the shipwrecks			1
last month , his crews spent hours scouring the ocean floor , searching waters up to 50 meters deep			2
" it 's an incredible story			0
it 's got shipwrecks , the remoteness of the @entity16 , putting the might of @entity85 industrialism against @entity86 , " says @entity72			0
since 1997 @entity73 has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attempting to locate the " @entity11 " and " @entity14			1
" the tale of the @entity89 expedition has enthralled @entity90 -- the wreckage has the dubious honor of being the only national historic site in @entity90 that has n't been found yet			2
" once @entity17 received his orders that sealed his fate , " @entity72 explains			1
" in directing them south - west into ultimately the @entity98 it took them to the ice choke point			0
once they fell into the clutch of that area , their fate was sealed			0
there 's not much wildlife there and it is isolated			0
" the last known account of the " @entity11 " and " @entity14 " came in 1848			1
a rock cairn with a message on it indicated that the harsh conditions had already claimed their first lives , with only 105 men left alive			2
@entity17 was one of the first casualties of his own expedition			1
that same year the men abandoned their ships , archaeologists believing they began making their way south in a desperate bid to find food			1
however the harsh environment supported little , and with few animals to hunt and over 100 men to feed , the chance of survival was low			2
it 's been suggested that the men may have resorted to cannibalism in their last - ditch efforts to survive			2
" there were far too many men to live off the environment			2
what man plans and what nature allows are two different things , " says @entity55			0
archaeologists have relied heavily upon oral @entity142 history to try to put the pieces of the puzzle together			0
based on their accounts it is thought some of the men lived for another three or four years after abandoning ship			1
but questions remain over exactly what happened to them			0
in 160 years only two skeletons and three perfectly preserved bodies have been uncovered			1
it is likely diseases such as scurvy claimed many lives but @entity26 believes it may have been the ships themselves that killed the sailors			2
his theory is that the men succumbed to lead poisoning derived from the internal pipe system used to melt ice into drinking water			2
it 's hoped the discovery of the ships will provide answers			2
' " there 's a charm to the story , " acknowledges @entity72			0
" by solving a mystery it takes the allure away			0
" but having said that , @entity72 is determined the search will go on until the " @entity11 " and the " @entity14 " are found			1
@entity73 insists that their searches have not been futile and they 'll continue to gather information to help with future efforts			0
" i hope we 're the last , " says @entity72			0
but after 160 years it 's possible that this tale may be frozen in time forever			1
" these are the last of the ghost ships , " says @entity26			2
" it is the world 's biggest ghost story			0
