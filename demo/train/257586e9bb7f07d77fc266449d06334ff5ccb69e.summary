adapting a beloved novel for the big screen often guarantees a solid showing at the box office			1
" @entity5 " looks to be no exception			1
based on @entity9 ' young adult novel , the movie is on track to rake in more than $ 80 million its opening weekend , reports say			1
but existing story lines , settings and dynamic characters are often accompanied by moviegoers ' idealistic expectations , leaving screenwriters to ponder : how do you honor the novel and please readers without compromising the film ? luckily for fans , " @entity23 " screenwriter and director @entity21 said he found a way			1
" i still want to go to that movie the same way everybody else does			2
i want to see aspects of the novel preserved , " @entity21 told @entity28			2
" i 'm a fan first			1
... i loved the book so much			1
i did n't have any desire to rework ( it ) in any major way			1
" however , @entity21 said certain aspects of " @entity5 " just do n't translate cinematically			1
those who have read the books , told from 16 - year - old @entity38 's perspective , already know why			2
" @entity5 " takes place in a post-apocalyptic world , in the fictional nation of @entity42			1
every year , one boy and one girl " tribute " are randomly selected from the nation 's 12 districts to compete in the @entity23 , a televised fight to the death			2
wealthy @entity51 citizens called @entity52 manipulate the @entity23			0
though they only briefly appear in the novel , their presence is felt by @entity38 , a @entity51 tribute , throughout the @entity5			1
" i ca n't shoot inside @entity38 ' head , " @entity21 said			1
" in the book , she speculates about what the @entity52 are doing			0
well , we created a whole ( visual ) world that the ( @entity52 ) are in			0
" there may be departures in the adaptation process , @entity21 added , but in the grand scheme of things , the movie is faithful to the novel			0
@entity69 , who plays @entity70 , a tribute from @entity51 , also stressed the importance of honoring @entity74 ' novel at a recent movie premiere			0
" if we deviate much , there are fans out there who will stalk me and kill me , " @entity69 joked			0
" ( the fans ) do n't ask for much			1
at the same time they watch everything ... ' oh , she 's supposed to be looking at the right , not the left ' -- little details			1
" while sticking to the novel might keep fans of the book series happy , telling the story scene by scene would yield a long , drawn - out cinematic experience , said @entity91 , a contributing editor at @entity92			1
" you 've got to be willing to cut , " she said			0
" find out which characters are central and which are n't			1
which relationships are central and which are n't			2
" @entity97 said " @entity23 " screenwriters @entity21 , @entity74 and @entity99 were smart to streamline a few characters , while pushing others into larger roles , such as head @entity103			0
casting the right actors is imperative when adapting a novel for the big screen , she said , adding that @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 are " pitch perfect " for their roles as @entity38 , @entity114 and @entity115 , respectively			1
" you ca n't say that about every ( role ) , " she said			2
" you ca n't say that ' @entity121 's ' @entity120 -- he 's the only one who could have played ( @entity122			2
" let 's not forget how angry " twilight " fans were when brunette @entity125 was first cast as @entity127			0
it 's no secret fans want popular characters to look a certain way , specifically how they envisioned them while they were reading the book			0
" @entity134 is a really intimate , internal experience , where you play your own movie in your head , " screenwriter @entity133 said			0
@entity133 , who adapted @entity140 ' " @entity139 , " which hits theaters in april , said , it helps when a book already reads like it was constructed for film			0
" @entity5 " is one of those books			1
despite the intense , made - for - the - big - screen action sequences in " games , " @entity21 said there was plenty to be concerned about when adapting it for the screen			1
" a lot of the action stuff , you know that 's hard work , and you know you 're going to get it , " @entity21 said			0
" but it 's really the delicate stuff			0
... it 's those intangible things you really have to capture : @entity38 ' character , her relationship with @entity167 , her relationship with her sister			2
... it 's that kind of stuff that 's very difficult			2
" @entity74 , who had a hand in the screenwriting process , took to her @entity175 page to share her thoughts on the adaptation of her novel : " i feel like the book and the film are individual yet complementary pieces that enhance one another			0

" when going to an adaptation , you 're going understanding that it 's not going to be the exact images you saw , " he added			0
" we 're all working under constraints to interpret what we saw in our heads and hope that it 's the same thing readers saw			0
