" we 're on the brink of creating @entity2			0
" that warning comes from my friend @entity4 , a former senior adviser on drug control policy under president @entity7			1
@entity4 now heads @entity8 , an anti-legalization group on whose board i sit			0
at the end of august , the administration that @entity4 served announced a retreat on marijuana policy			1
it will allow the states of @entity17 and @entity18 to proceed with the legal retailing of marijuana			1
and it will get out of the way of the approximately 20 states that allow so - called medical marijuana			1
with a referendum on marijuana scheduled in 2014 in @entity29 and action likely in coming years in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , half the states in the union may soon allow the sale of marijuana to almost anybody determined to buy it			2
to understand where the marijuana debate is going , it 's important to appreciate that " medical marijuana " is a laughable fiction			1
in @entity31 , the typical user of so - called medical marijuana is a 32 - year - old white man with no life - threatening illness but a long record of substance abuse			1
under @entity18 's now - superseded medical marijuana regime , only 2 % of those prescribed marijuana suffered from cancer , and only 1 % from hiv / aids			1
some 94 % cited unspecified " pain " as the justification for their pot prescription			0
false patients find unscrupulous doctors : in @entity35 , only 10 practitioners write the majority of all marijuana prescriptions in the state			2
when a tv crew visited a marijuana dispensary in @entity64 last year , they met for five minutes with a man who turned out to be licensed as an acupuncturist and were then handed a prescription signed by a doctor they never met			2
@entity70 : why i changed my mind on weed where marijuana is allowed to be sold , somebody will sell it			2
as @entity4 warns , the marijuana industry of the future is already taking form			1
in march of this year , @entity79 devoted its prestigious cover to the @entity81 , an investor group seeking to capitalize on the emerging marijuana market			1
@entity83 famously explained the economics of tobacco : " it costs a penny to make			0
sell it for a dollar			0
plus , it 's addictive ! " alcohol conforms to the same ugly logic			2
half of all the alcohol consumed in the @entity95 is consumed by underage and excessive drinkers			0
as one industry observer has bitterly remarked : " regardless of its public stance , the industry considers underage and excessive drinking to be profit centers that need nurturing , rather than problems that need solving			2
" @entity4 foresees that the emerging marijuana industry will target the same populations as are targeted by the tobacco and alcohol industries -- young people and racial minorities -- and for the same reason : secure and contented people do n't tend to be heavy consumers of psychoactive substances			1
@entity4 has laid out a better vision of an effective national drug control policy in his new book , " @entity116			0
" @entity4 's message eschews punishment in favor of treatment ; it replaces condemnation with compassion			0
but it understands the difference between compassion and credulity			0
nobody ever helped a troubled person by accepting lies at face value			0
" @entity116 " debunks seven myths about marijuana , beginning with the biggest myth of all : that this drug is harmless and nonaddictive			1
it 's a message that is all the more timely in the face of last week 's report by the @entity139 that regular marijuana use surged over the half - decade from 2007 to 2012			1
" @entity116 " is the best explication i 've seen of the errors on which the case for marijuana legalization has been built			0
it 's a book that every concerned parent should read -- and that every advocate of legalization should be challenged to answer .			0

@entity151 : in august , the @entity7 administration retreated on marijuana policy
@entity155 : it 's important to appreciate that " medical marijuana " is a laughable fiction
he says the emerging marijuana industry will target young people and minorities
@entity155 : it is a myth that marijuana is harmless and nonaddictive ; we need better policy
