@entity7 was then fouled by @entity23 with @entity24 scoring from the penalty spot to give the home side a 3 - 1 lead at the break			1
it was 4 - 1 shortly into the second half when @entity7 's neat footwork set him up for a fourth , but still the points were not sealed			2
a mistake by @entity34 allowed @entity35 to play a one - two with @entity36 to reduce the deficit to two goals			0
@entity8 nerves were finally eased when @entity7 played a neat pass to @entity41 for the @entity43 international to score the fifth only for @entity45 to grab his third in four games for @entity0 to complete an eight - goal thriller			2

@entity49 looked to be cruising to victory after a superb strike from @entity72 and a second from @entity74			2
but @entity56 hit back with goals from former @entity49 players @entity77 and @entity78 , who scored from the spot			2
in the early kickoff on @entity82 , @entity80 was held to its second straight draw of the festive period in a 1 - 1 draw at @entity86			1

we should have played better today			0
