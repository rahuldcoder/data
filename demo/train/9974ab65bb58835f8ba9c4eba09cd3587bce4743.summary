just the other day , en route to school , my husband and daughters ended up walking behind a smoker on the street			0
the three of them immediately talked about how " gross " they think smoking is			2
my younger daughter , who 's 7 , asked why someone would start to smoke in the first place , according to my husband			0
then , my nearly - 9 - year - old said she read a book in which a guy would n't kiss a girl because she smoked			1
it 's exactly that sentiment -- that smokers may be considered less attractive , appealing or desirable -- that a provocative new music video hopes to capitalize on to persuade teens never to start smoking in the first place			1
the video plays off the term " left swipe , " which with the popularity of dating apps like @entity28 and @entity29 has come to define someone as unattractive			1
if you like someone on a dating app , you swipe them right			2
if you do n't like them , you give them a " left swipe			2
" ( full disclosure : i had no idea what these terms meant until i reported this story ! ) and so , in the video , featuring musical performers @entity47 , @entity48 and a host of @entity51 stars including @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , each time a profile picture appears with someone smoking , there is a call to # @entity58			1
smoking , drinking , prescription drug abuse by teens is down , survey says " yeah , you work out , you are in shape , ok			1
i like the six - pack abs , not the six packs a day , " sings @entity47 the video is part of the " truth " campaign , one of the largest national youth smoking - prevention initiatives in the country , and is directed and funded by the national public foundation @entity74			1
" we wanted to debunk a few things here , " said @entity75 , chief executive officer and president of @entity74			0
" one , ( smoking ) does n't make you more attractive , and we know the thing that young people care about most is connecting with other people , especially for romantic opportunities , and that social smoking , whatever you call it , light smoking , intermittent smoking , is smoking			1
" from our perspective , if you light it , you should left - swipe it			2
it 's just a bad idea			0
" some research shows how dating profiles featuring smoking get less traction than those that do not			2
the anti-smoking group action on @entity102 conducted an experiment			2
it created two identical profiles -- " @entity109 " and " @entity110 " -- on the dating app @entity28 , each featuring the same attractive woman			2
@entity109 was smoking ; @entity110 was not			0
@entity109 and @entity110 then both swiped right on 1,000 men over a week , again meaning they liked them			0
fifty - four percent of the men chose @entity110 , the nonsmoking profile , while 29 % selected @entity109 , the profile with a cigarette , according to the group 's findings			2
the campaign comes as cigarette smoking has reached historic lows among teens , according to the latest monitoring the future survey by the @entity125 , released in december			1
@entity126 launches teen anti-smoking campaign among eighth - , 10th - and 12th - graders who were polled in 1997 , 28 % said they smoked in the prior month			1
that number dropped to 8 % in 2014 , according to the report , which is amazing			0
but there are reasons to be concerned , including how teens seem to have dramatically different perceptions about the impact of social smoking versus being a regular smoker			1
" one of the things we see is a belief among young people that if you only smoke occasionally , light smoking or intermittent smoking , that somehow that 's not as dangerous , " @entity75 said			0
in a recent study , though most teens said they believe that heavy smoking is harmful , only 64 % said light smoking , consuming a few cigarettes a day , was very harmful			1
nearly 25 % believed that intermittent smoking caused little or no harm , according to the survey of nearly 25,000 teens in the @entity155 and showcased in the @entity156			1
would you tell your kids you got high ? e-cigarette use among teens is also on the rise : seventeen percent of 12th - graders , 16 % of 10th - graders and 8 % of eighth - graders said they had used them in the past month , according to the recent monitoring the future survey			1
and 23 % of 12th - graders said they smoked tobacco using a hookah in the past year in 2014 , up from 17 % in 2010			0
in addition , 19 % said they smoked small or little cigars , often called cigarillos , in 2014 , down from 23 % in 2010			0
" young people just do n't understand that a little cigar is just as dangerous as a regular cigarette , " @entity75 said			2
" it 's very concerning and really , really dangerous			0
... we know for sure that combustible tobacco will kill you			0
" the video marks a departure from other ad campaigns , including some by the @entity126 last year , that try to graphically show teens the health risks associated with smoking			1
@entity75 says those ads are effective too , but this approach may have more impact when it comes to changing perceptions			0
why it 's still a big deal if your teen smokes pot ? young people think they are " never going to get old			0
they are never going to get sick			0
they do n't even really think their social smoking , if you will , behavior is really real smoking or that dangerous , " she said			1
" doing it when they 're out with others , believing that it makes them more attractive , that it helps them connect with others is an increasing trend			0
" @entity75 would not reveal the cost of airing the 60 - second version during the @entity217 but said the move clearly represents a " significant " investment			1
" it 's very hard to aggregate live audiences of young people , the moments when you can do that are far and few between , so we want to take advantage of them , " she said			0
" we know that youth will be watching			0
" and the hope is that they wo n't just watch but will share the video on social media along with the hashtag # @entity58			1
do you think this new anti-smoking music video will impact teens ? share your thoughts with @entity238 on @entity239 or @entity240 on @entity241 .			1

an anti-smoking music video will capitalize on popularity of dating apps among teens
a 60 - second spot was to be showcased during the @entity217
survey : teen cigarette use down , but teens do n't view social smoking as very harmful
