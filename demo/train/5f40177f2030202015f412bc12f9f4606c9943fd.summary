-- recently , technology enthusiasts around the planet had the opportunity to get better acquainted with @entity4 , the creator of @entity5 , the first privately owned company to send a spacecraft to the space station			1
launched in the same manner as a @entity11 startup , @entity5 designed and manufactured the @entity12 , which successfully completed a mission with the @entity14 before splashing down into the @entity15			1
i see @entity4 , a 40 - year - old entrepreneur who made his fortune by co-founding @entity18 , as a " visioneer			1
" that is to say , he is someone who combines scientific and engineering prowess -- in his case , a degree in physics -- with an expansive view of how technology will upend traditional economic models , and has the ability to inspire others to support his work			0
@entity4 has bold visions for the future			1
when he finished college , he identified three areas that could change the world			0
one was the @entity36 ; another was new sources of energy ; and the third was transforming our civilization in such a way so that it could expand out into the solar system			0
his success with @entity18 and then with @entity46 -- a company he started that makes high - performance electric roadsters -- pushed him to take on the challenge of @entity5			1
the successful launch of @entity12 was a big step toward the completion of @entity4 's trifecta			1
@entity4 's entrepreneurial activities rest on the shoulders of previous visioneers			1
in the 1970s , @entity59 physicist @entity58 achieved celebrity status for designing and advocating free - floating space colonies as the new frontier for humanity			2
in 1977 , when @entity65 hosted its first @entity66 , @entity58 's ideas were discussed by scientists , aerospace executives and politicians , including then - gov. @entity70			0
while today , such visions of the future seem fantastical -- space colonies ... really ? -- they make more sense if seen in the context of their time			2
in @entity58 's day , fears of overpopulation , resource shortages and general eco-catastrophism permeated public discussions and popular culture as people fretted about an impending era of limits			0
compared with that era 's other mega-projects such as the @entity89 , @entity58 's ideas were not so far - fetched			0
@entity4 has inherited @entity58 's concept for the " humanization of space			1
" but like other dot - com billionaires who make up the so - called @entity96 movement , his pursuits have a decided libertarian strain			0
many visioneers champion free markets , less government , fewer regulations and profits for those who test the technological envelope			0
this is different from what @entity58 had in mind , which aimed mostly to benefit society at large			0
@entity4 may be the most prominent visioneer , but he is not the only one			1
recently , the @entity111 profiled @entity112 , the biologist - entrepreneur who is hoping to create bioengineered bacteria that can generate food and fuel for an increasingly crowded planet			0
then there are others who have proposed radical geoengineering schemes , such as injecting tons of sunlight - reflecting particulates into the stratosphere as a way to address the threat of climate change			0
so far , @entity126 has remained the no.1 destination for people such as @entity4 or @entity112			1
as the rest of the world catches up -- think @entity132 -- and competes with us on innovation and technology , we must make sure that our country can continue to attract brilliant minds who can take speculative ideas out of the hands of sci - fi writers and technological forecasters and put them on firmer ground			2
the @entity126 government as well as private groups like the @entity145 can play an important role in stimulating and helping budding visioneers through prizes , funding or other forms of support			1
for someone like @entity4 , the present is merely a prototype -- a provisional plan for what may become a magnificent and perhaps less limited future			2
who knows , his trailblazing might just make it feasible and affordable for you to take a vacation to @entity163			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

@entity5 successfully launched the @entity12 to the space station
@entity166 : @entity4 , founder of @entity5 , is a " visioneer "
he says people like @entity4 can take ideas out of science *fiction* and turn them into reality
@entity166 : @entity126 must make sure it remains the *top* destination for visioneers
