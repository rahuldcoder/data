@entity4 , a @entity5 internet and telecommunications company , introduced the world thursday to @entity7 , a robot designed to read , and respond to , its user 's mood			1
" people may look back 100 years later , or 200 years later ( and say ) that was a historic moment we are having today , " said @entity11 , @entity4 's ceo , in a translated video on @entity4 's website			2
@entity7 stands about 4 feet tall and weighs just 62 pounds			2
at the event in @entity18 , the little humanoid offered a traditional @entity5 bow to the crowd before chatting with @entity11 , shaking hands and urging him to smile			2
@entity7 gets feedback from its user via facial - recognition technology and a bank of cameras , audio recorders and sensors in its head			1
@entity4 says that instead of being programmed , @entity7 learns how to behave over time			1
feedback is uploaded to cloud storage where it can be used by other units to modify the way they behave			0
