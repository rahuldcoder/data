the day after @entity3 suspect @entity2 appeared in @entity5 federal court in @entity6 , top @entity0 in @entity1 continue to question the strategy to try him in the @entity5 court system			1
rep. @entity9 , chairman of the @entity10 , said that @entity2 's prosecution in @entity5 courts prevents authorities from getting necessary information about the @entity3 attack on a @entity5 compound that killed four @entity5 , including ambassador @entity17 , in 2012			1
" you need the opportunity to gather the intelligence that he has , " the @entity18 @entity0 said on @entity20 's " @entity19			1
" lost intelligence ? @entity2 was brought to the @entity5 via ship so interrogators would have more time to question him			1
but after 10 days , he was read his @entity29 rights , a requirement of the criminal justice system			2
@entity29 includes the right to remain silent to avoid self - incrimination , which he would not have if tried in military courts			0
@entity3 killings suspect @entity2 pleads not guilty in @entity5 @entity2 is being charged with providing material support to terrorists , but prosecutors say more charges are possible			1
uttering similar talking points on two different shows , @entity9 and rep. @entity43 of @entity44 , chairman of the @entity45 , said intelligence gathering should be the priority over criminal prosecution			0
" when we rushed to interrogate and rushed to @entity52 , we lose valuable intelligence , " @entity43 said on @entity50 ' " @entity49			0
" a @entity5 official told @entity20 that @entity2 provided interrogators information both before and after he was read his miranda rights , but @entity9 said @entity2 " likely " did not give actionable intelligence to @entity59 interrogators during his journey across the @entity61			1
" he could give ... some details of some things , but not to the point where an @entity59 agent would say , ' hey , @entity62 , here we go			0
' " " he 's been compliant , but not cooperative , " @entity9 added			2
@entity9 , @entity43 and many republicans in @entity1 would have preferred that @entity68 be sent to the @entity5 detention center at @entity70 and be tried through military tribunals , which offers the accused fewer rights for suspected terrorists			1
the president has resisted such calls and defends his decision , pointing to the prosecution of numerous other foreign terrorists that have been successfully tried and found guilty in @entity5 courts			1
@entity80 has not sent one person to @entity70 since he entered office in 2009			1
no one defended the @entity80 administration 's decision on the political shows			2
of the two @entity88 members of @entity1 that appeared on the sunday shows , neither was asked about @entity2			0
controversy swirls over handling of @entity3 suspect @entity2 while many issues in @entity6 are rankled with partisanship , the @entity3 attack of september 11 , 2012 , has been especially plagued by bitter partisanship			0
and now that @entity100 , who was secretary of state during the time , is now considered a potential presidential candidate , the issue 's partisanship only intensified			2
" we have brought a foreign terrorist and given him due process rights under our @entity107 here in the @entity5 , right down the street from [ where ] you and i are in the nation 's @entity112 , " @entity43 said			1
@entity9 said charges of accused terrorists complicates the war against them			0
" to me , these are enemy combatants			0
if we start saying they 're criminals , i do n't know how you fight back in a place like the @entity118 , " @entity9 said , referring to @entity118			0
@entity43 said it 's " shameful " that other @entity3 suspects are not being apprehended because the @entity5 is " so intent on building a criminal prosecution			1
" " i 'm a federal prosecutor , but i think the ... military intelligence value outweighs a criminal case , " he said			0
@entity9 praises @entity2 's capture while @entity9 criticized the administration , he praised @entity2 's capture , saying it sends a " clear message " that the @entity5 wo n't turn a blind eye to attacks on @entity5			1
it 's a message that is necessary , according to @entity9 , as threats to @entity5 are at an all - time high as @entity118 continues to destabilize @entity135 and fight in @entity136			1
" this is as dangerous time for an @entity139 threat to the @entity5 as i 've ever seen , " he said			1
" the terrorists in @entity136 are extremely sophisticated , very advanced			0
" @entity9 pointed to a major vulnerability at international airports			0
" i ca n't go into all the details , but overseas airport security is a real concern we 've had in the @entity5 , " he said			1
republicans on all the sunday political shows expressed the same concern			0
rep. @entity150 , member of the @entity45 , said on @entity152 's " @entity151 " that " @entity136 is our biggest threat right now			2
" @entity43 said @entity118 is " the number one national security threat since 9/11			0
" @entity5 sen. @entity156 of @entity157 , on @entity50 ' " @entity49 , " called @entity118 the " richest , most powerful and most savage group of terrorists in the history of mankind			1
" @entity135 crisis : key developments " i see @entity118 as a direct threat to the @entity5 , they have the capacity , and i believe they have the intent " to attack , he said			2
@entity80 appeared to downplay the immediacy of the threats , saying the possibility of more attacks have existed throughout his presidency			2
" i think we have been under serious threat predating 9/11 from those who embrace this ideology , " he said on " @entity151			0
" in an effort to tamp down on @entity118 ' strength , @entity80 asked @entity1 this week for $ 500 million dollars to support moderate rebels in @entity136 's complex and multifaceted civil war			2
picking the moderate faction is a complicated effort , however , as @entity118 is fighting @entity136 president @entity185 , whom the @entity5 also opposes			2
@entity187 @entity88 sen. @entity186 thinks it 's a bad idea			0
" for us to jump in and try to take sides and put money in there or air strikes or forces right now , not knowing who the friendlies are , and not knowing if any equipment that we send over there will get in the hands of @entity118 , all we do is exasperate the problem , " he said on " @entity49			0

@entity0 **lawmakers** oppose @entity204 's trial in the @entity5 court system
they think he should have been sent to @entity70
the same **lawmakers** say the @entity5 is facing serious threats
