-- when @entity3 's alarm clock app failed , letting down a multitude of users on @entity6 and january 2 due to the bug the company still has n't fully explained , we started looking around for alternatives			1
@entity3 said yesterday that the failure of its clock app only happens when you set a one - time alarm , and it will somehow fix itself on january 3			1
we have made a call and sent an e-mail into @entity3 asking why this happened			0
meanwhile , we were thinking it would n't hurt to look around for something that might be dependable 365 days a year			0
in this post , we mentioned one alarm clock app that costs $ 0.99 and gets the job done , but its design leaves much to be desired			1
what about free apps ? are there acceptable alternatives to @entity3 's clock that 's included in every copy of its mobile operating system ? and most importantly , do those other clocks suffer from the same alarm problem ? we confirmed that the alarm failure problem in @entity3 's app is still happening today , when we set an alarm and nothing happened			1
we found five free alarm clock apps that do n't have that problem			2
we picked these acceptable alternatives out of the hundreds of choices available , and they all were able to reliably sound an alarm today			2
each one has certain limitations , but the impact of those deficiencies is lessened by the fact that these apps are all free			0
@entity48 this ad - supported alarm clock reminds us of the @entity51 operating system with its flip clock on top			1
we like its helpful weather report included just below the timepiece			0
it works when you have the phone sleeping and the screen is locked , but for that background alarm capability , you 'll be limited to just four different sounds with the free version			2
@entity64 another ad - supported app , this one can also multitask , so the app does n't need to be running for its alarm to sound			2
we like the way it offers a choice of pleasant - looking analog clock faces in addition to the usual digital look			2
an unusual feature is its ability to display almanac information such as sunrise , sunset , the exact time of midday and even your latitude and longitude			0
@entity85 swipe from side to side , and you 're offered a choice of a dozen different clock styles			0
some of them are stylish			0
others , not so much			0
surprisingly , this app is not ad - supported , and you can wake to vibrate - only alarms without sounds			0
what 's the catch ? although you can lock your screen and put it in sleep mode , the app must be running for its alarm sounds to work			1
this one would work best in a dock overnight			0
alarm @entity105 here 's another ad - supported app that has fast app switching for background alarms			1
however , there 's only a few choices for alarm sounds if you want to use that feature			1
if you 're willing to leave it in a dock overnight and keep it running , it can wake you up to any song in your device 's music collection			1
a slight limitation : its orientation is vertical - only			0
@entity126 at first glance , @entity126 seems surprisingly full - featured , but maybe that 's because it 's ad - supported			1
it automatically adjusts for landscape or portrait orientation , but although you can turn the alarm off for different days , it only allows you to set one alarm time in this free version			0
still , it has a lot going for it , with its alarm sounds that work when you 're not running the app , and for heavy sleepers , it offers a puzzle that you must solve before you can silence the alarm			1

@entity48 reminds us of the @entity51 operating system
@entity148 can wake you up to any song in your device 's music collection
@entity126 offers a puzzle that you must solve before you can silence the alarm
