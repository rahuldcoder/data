-- life is never dull at @entity2 , at least not since @entity3 took over the reins of the @entity6 football club in may			1
in just seven months since the @entity9 businessman bought previous owner @entity10 's majority stake , sacking has followed sacking , rumors have run rife , and controversy has never been far around the corner as a series of bizarre incidents has moved the team off the back pages and into the forefront of @entity6 newspapers			1
@entity3 has , remarkably , fired four coaches , removed every local sponsor involved with the club from the previous season and dismissed his entire administrative staff , resulting in @entity2 being unable to print any tickets for the opening match of the 2011 - 12 @entity31 campaign			1
he also sacked the entire coaching team following the 2 - 0 defeat to @entity34 in july , before a widely - reported incident in august when he burst into the dressing room with his bodyguards to berate the players following their performance in the 2 - 2 home draw with bottom club @entity41			2
but @entity3 had not finished with his revolution , and in september he declared that the club would cut all ties with two of its biggest supporters ' groups , who provided much - needed income for the club , thus alienating the hardcore fans he is trying to get on his side			1
off the pitch , @entity3 is also battling various authorities on a number of fronts , with a raft of questions regarding the club 's finances still remaining unanswered			1
already fined $ 22,000 this season for flouting licensing rules after failing to respond to budget queries , the latest dramatic twist in the club 's fortunes occurred in october when a court ruled against a player agent who tried to force @entity2 into bankruptcy over a debt of 400,000 @entity71 ( $ 444,000 )			1
but , in another twist , the public prosecutor of @entity2 canton subsequently charged @entity3 with forgery , for allegedly falsifying a @entity77 document which was used as part of the evidence to prove his solvency in that trial			1
" the @entity77 does not recognize the document as one of its own and contests that it has been produced by someone authorized to sign it in its name , " the prosecutor said in a statement			2
@entity3 has subsequently accepted the documentation was false , but insists he had no idea how it came into the court 's possession and that he was unaware of its existence -- and it will now be up to the courts to decide what part he played in its creation			2
however , the drama does not end there			0
a respected @entity6 newspaper reported that @entity3 is illegally living in the country , because he does not have a valid residence permit			1
according to @entity105 , @entity3 has only a basic visa that must be renewed every six months , and only after leaving the country , and he was unable to produce a valid document when police visited him at his office in @entity111			2
" he is an illegal immigrant that could be thrown out of the country at any time , just like any other foreigner who is on @entity6 soil illegally , " claimed the paper			0
despite all this scrutiny into his affairs , very little is actually known about the reclusive @entity3 , who admits to having close ties with @entity9 leader @entity120			1
he rose to prominence in the 1990s as a member of the regional government of @entity9 and owned a successful export company			0
in @entity6 , @entity3 owns two @entity111 - based firms , which reportedly oversee his oil and gas trading , real estate and construction empire , but it is his activities with @entity2 which are causing greater concern , with some figures now fearing for the very existence of the club			1
@entity135 , sports editor of the @entity137 - speaking magazine @entity136 , told @entity0 he believes @entity3 will eventually bankrupt @entity2			1
" the whole club is in a real mess			0
salaries are always paid late and november 's wages have still not been paid , meaning players are going into the holidays without their wages , " @entity135 said			0
" it is hard to see a way out for the club at the moment			0
@entity3 says he has money , but can not transfer it in @entity6 , which might be true , but there are so many things we do n't know about him -- for example his relationship with the @entity9 hierarchy			1
" it is all a bit of a mystery because @entity3 does not speak @entity137 or @entity159 and access to him is very difficult			0
" @entity135 said the club faced a strike by players unhappy about their lack of payment			0
" some players are trying to leave because they have n't been paid for six weeks , although they need three months without pay to legally free themselves from their contracts			0
either way , i have been told the players could strike before they are due to return on january 5 , " he said			0
" i give the club only a 30 % chance of surviving bankruptcy and @entity3 will go down with the club			2
for him it is all about pride and showing that he can succeed , because he is being criticized from all angles			0
" @entity180 , sports editor for the @entity34 - based @entity182 website , believes the @entity6 authorities might decide to throw @entity2 out of the @entity31 before the fixtures resume at the beginning of february			1
" there are only 10 teams in the top division and they play each other home and away twice			0
half those fixtures have already been played and if the league found financial irregularities with @entity2 , they could throw them out without it disrupting the schedule , " @entity180 told @entity0			2
" in @entity6 , you need to provide correct financial documentation to play in the @entity31 -- and this mess has happened because previous owner @entity10 had the right documents , which then became @entity3 's when he bought the club			1
" a club has never been sold after documents have been accepted -- and the league have now changed the rules to ensure each individual owner has to provide financial evidence			2
" in march , the league will decide for next season , and it seems impossible that @entity2 will be accepted under the current conditions			2
" with all this disarray in the boardroom , it is worth nothing that -- on the pitch at least -- current coach @entity214 is doing a decent job with the team			0
@entity2 lie fifth in the table , just five points off second place , after a run of five wins and two draw in nine matches			0
but , with the festive period upon us , and wages still not being paid , it remains to be seen whether those players , or even the club , will still be around when the @entity31 finally returns to action .			0
