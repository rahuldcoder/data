@entity0 -- jurors began deliberations thursday in the @entity5 wrongful - death trial , potentially bringing the contentious case to a close after five months of testimony and three days of closing arguments			1
the 12 jurors spent two hours in the jury room thursday afternoon before ending their day ; they will return friday morning for more deliberations			1
@entity14 's lawyer delivered his final arguments in the @entity17 trial thursday morning , delivering his rebuttal to defense closing arguments			2
@entity17 's @entity20 had asked jurors to find @entity5 responsible for his death , not the company that promoted and produced his comeback concerts in 2009			1
@entity5 's mother and three children are suing @entity17 , contending the company was liable in the pop icon 's drug overdose death because its executives negligently hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity31			1
" plaintiffs want you to hold a concert promoter liable for @entity5 's overdose in his bedroom at night , behind locked doors on june 25 , 2009 , " @entity20 told jurors			1
" an overdose of the drug administered to mr. @entity5 by his longtime doctor -- dr. @entity31 -- who he 'd been seeing for years , a doctor he brought to @entity0 from @entity42			0
" " how dare they come up here and accept no responsibility and blame it all on @entity5 , " @entity5 lawyer @entity43 said in his rebuttal			1
@entity43 suggested that @entity5 's share of blame was 20 % , " but the rest goes on @entity17			1
" when the trial began five months ago , @entity20 warned he would show " ugly stuff " and reveal @entity5 's " deepest , darkest secret			1
" the revelations that jurors heard from 58 witnesses over 83 days of testimony spanning 21 weeks included details of @entity5 's drug use and his shopping for a doctor to give him the surgical anesthetic propofol that he thought would give him sleep			2
" he was nearly half a billion dollars in debt , " @entity20 argued wednesday			2
" his mother 's house was near foreclosure , we did n't know that then			0
what else do we know now ? that mr. @entity5 spent decades shopping for doctors to give him the painkillers he wanted			0
mr. @entity5 made sure we did n't know that			0
" @entity43 , the lead @entity5 lawyer , conceded in his closing tuesday that the singer may have some fault for his own death , but said " it 's about shared responsibility			1
" @entity5 did use prescription painkillers and was warned that using propofol at home to sleep was risky , " but he never had a problem until dr. @entity31 was working and until @entity31 negotiated with @entity17 , " @entity43 argued			2
who 's to blame for @entity5 's death ? the @entity17 lawyer argued wednesday that @entity5 should take the full blame			1
" the sad truth is mr. @entity5 's death was caused by his choices and it would have happened no matter what -- with or without @entity17			1
" the @entity5 lawyer urged jurors to award the family between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion in damages for what he called @entity17 's share of liability in @entity5 's death -- to replace what @entity5 would have earned touring , had he lived , and for the personal suffering from the loss of a son and father			1
@entity20 told jurors wednesday that was " an absurd number			2
" @entity14 testified that she filed the wrongful death lawsuit three years ago against @entity17 " because i want to know what really happened to my son			2
" @entity31 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity5 's propofol overdose death			2
the judge is allowing a television camera in court for the closing arguments and verdict			0
lawyer : blame @entity5 for his death , not @entity17 burden of " @entity121 " @entity122 -- a former college football player who has a reputation for winning large damage awards -- appeared more aggressive in his rebuttal than in his initial closing arguments delivered tuesday			1
in what may become a much - repeated video highlight , @entity43 joked about how his @entity17 counterpart had accused him of making up the estimate of $ 59 million that @entity5 could have been expected to have given his mother and children in support had he lived			1
" poof ! poof ! i just made it up ! " @entity43 said dramatically as he pointed to @entity137 , sitting at the @entity17 defense table			0
the line and gesture drew a laugh from some jurors			0
@entity43 showed jurors that the figure was actually from a opinion provided by a financial expert that @entity17 hired to analyze the issue			2
@entity20 , in his closing wednesday , referenced the expert 's lower - end estimate of $ 21 million			2
the numbers could be important in guiding the jury if it decides to award damages to the @entity155			2
@entity17 's defense @entity31 treated @entity5 and his children for minor illnesses while they lived in @entity42 for three years , before the singer returned to @entity0 to prepare for his " @entity161 " comeback tour			1
it was @entity5 -- not @entity17 executives -- who chose @entity31 to be his full - time doctor for his tour , the company 's lawyers contend			1
@entity17 co-ceo @entity167 negotiated to pay @entity31 $ 150,000 a month only because of @entity5 's request to have his doctor with him as he performed 50 shows at @entity172 's @entity171 , they argue			1
" he told them ' we 're bringing this doctor , ' " @entity20 said			0
" this was a choice mr. @entity5 made			0
he was a grown man			0
" @entity17 executives tried to talk @entity5 out of taking an @entity179 doctor with him on tour , suggesting he could save money by using a physician in @entity172 , @entity20 said			1
" but mr. @entity5 was undeterred , " he said			0
" ultimately , it was his money , his doctor , his choice			0
he certainly was n't going to take ' no ' for an answer			0
" there was no need to check @entity31 's background because he was a licensed , successful doctor who was known to @entity5 , @entity20 said			1
" all @entity17 knew was dr. @entity31 was mr. @entity5 's longtime doctor			1
" a key argument in the @entity5 case is that @entity17 was negligent by not ordering a financial background check of @entity31 , which would have revealed he was in a dire financial situation and not successful			2
his desperation to keep his lucrative job led @entity31 to violate his @entity200 to do no harm by using the dangerous propofol infusions to put @entity5 to sleep each night for two months , @entity5 lawyers argue			0
@entity17 executives had no way of knowing @entity31 was treating @entity5 's insomnia with propofol in the privacy of his bedroom , their lawyers contend			1
@entity5 was a secretive addict , adept at keeping family , friends and other doctors in the dark about his medical treatments , they argue			2
but two doctors testified that they told @entity215 about @entity5 's abuse of painkillers and his insomnia during tours in the 1990s , when the @entity17 executive served as tour manager			1
@entity5 lawyers argue @entity215 , who was the top producer on the new tour , should have known that @entity5 could suffer the same problems in 2009			0
the deterioration of @entity5 's health over the two months he was being treated by @entity31 was a red flag that there was a problem , but @entity17 executives negligently ignored the warning , @entity5 lawyers argue			1
by june 19 , he was frail , suffering chills , unable to do his trademark dances and paranoid , according to testimony			0
" everyone believed at the time that a 50 - year - old man , who had n't performed in a decade was tired , out of shape and very nervous , " @entity20 argued wednesday			0
" that 's what they believed at the time and it makes sense			0
" @entity17 would avoid a negative verdict if it is able to convince at least four of the 12 jurors that it did not hire @entity31			0
it is the first of 16 questions on the jury verdict form			0
if jurors answer it with a " no " -- that @entity17 did not hire the doctor -- they would end their deliberations and the trial			2
an @entity17 lawyer e-mailed an employment contract to @entity31 on the morning of june 24 , 2009			0
@entity31 signed it and faxed it back to the company that day			0
but the signature lines for @entity17 's ceo and for @entity5 were never signed since @entity5 died the next day			1
but @entity43 , the lead @entity5 lawyer , told jurors tuesday that all the elements of an oral contract -- " just as valid as a written contract " -- were in place when @entity5 died			2
@entity31 had been treating @entity5 for two months and the written contract stated that his start day was may 1 , 2009			0
a series of e-mail exchanges involving @entity31 and @entity17 executives and lawyers support this argument , @entity43 said			0
a look at the life of @entity5 blame and damages if the jury concludes @entity17 has liability , it would have to decide how much the company should pay in economic and personal damages to @entity5 's mother and children			1
they can use estimates of @entity5 's " lost earnings capacity " -- the amount of money he could reasonably be expected to have earned if he had lived -- to guide them			0
@entity17 expert @entity288 testified it was " speculative " that @entity5 would have even completed another tour because of his drug use , damaged reputation and history of failed projects			2
he suggested the star may never have earned another dime			0
@entity20 's closing argument about damages must overcome the impression left on jurors tuesday , when @entity43 played a video montage of @entity5 performances			1
" that is , i think , the best evidence of if @entity5 could have sold tickets -- not what mr. @entity288 would tell you , " @entity43 told jurors			0
@entity43 suggested jurors pick a number between $ 900 million and $ 1.6 billion for economic damages			2
they should add on another $ 290 million for non-economic damages -- or personal damages , he said			0
@entity20 argued that the number , if the jury finds @entity17 liable , should be closer to $ 21 million , the amount of money @entity17 's expert calculated @entity5 would have given his mother and three children over the next 16 years			1
he could n't have given them more because he had a $ 400 million debt that was getting deeper , he said			0
" if mr. @entity5 had lived , it 's hard to see how he would ever have dug himself out of that whole , " @entity20 said			1
the last question on the verdict form asks jurors to assign a percentage that they believe represents @entity5 's share of blame in his death			1
the total damages owed by @entity17 would be reduced by that percentage			0
while @entity17 lawyers did not suggest a percentage , @entity43 suggested jurors reduce the damage award by 20 % to reflect @entity5 's share of blame			1
@entity5 's mom remembers her ' sweet little boy '			0
