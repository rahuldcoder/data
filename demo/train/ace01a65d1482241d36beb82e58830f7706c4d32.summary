-- months after apologizing for overeager users fingering innocent people as potential suspects in the wake of the @entity7 bombings , @entity1 on monday shut down a section devoted to chasing down the @entity10 shooter			1
clicking on the page , or " subreddit " as specialized communities are called on the site , " @entity15 " now leads to an image of a closed door wrapped in yellow " caution " tape and a message saying it has been banned			0
" we banned it because it violated site rules by encouraging the posting of personal information , " @entity1 general manager @entity21 said in a prepared statement			1
" we do n't allow the posting of personal information under any circumstances			1
" the subreddit was created when authorities were still searching for suspects and it was unclear whether there was one shooter or multiple shooters			1
but @entity1 shut it down almost immediately			1
police have since named @entity39 , 34 , as the lone gunman			1
he was killed monday in a shootout with security at the naval yard			2
in separate subreddit about @entity45 , a related post , " @entity48 , " continued with @entity1 's blessing			2
users posted links to news sources , information from law enforcement and other official information in an effort to keep people informed in the shooting 's aftermath			0
on tuesday , some were speculating that the @entity10 subreddit may have been a joke			2
the user who created it uses the name " uglyredditors " and may have just been trolling -- doing something stupid or cruel just to get a reaction out of others			0
@entity69 at @entity70 captured a screen shot of early conversation in the subreddit , which was mostly jokes , profanity and people saying the subreddit was a bad idea in light of @entity80			2
" yes , nothing bad is going to come of this , surely " one user wrote			0
" are they really going to let this s * * * happen twice ? " in april , redditors banded together to try to piece together what happened in the @entity80 bombings , which killed three people and injured more than 260 others			1
what resulted was the sharing of photos of " suspects " that had been taken near the marathon 's finish line			0
among other theories , users speculated that @entity100 , a @entity101 student who had been missing since march , could be a possible suspect in the bombings			0
@entity100 's family temporarily took down a @entity105 page asking for help finding him after they were bombarded by ugly comments			0
@entity100 's body was found later that month in @entity111 's @entity110			0
no foul play was suspected , police said , although an official cause of death has still not been reported			0
amid the confusion over the @entity80 bombings , other @entity1 users focused on two young men with heavy - looking bags , one of whom wore a blue track suit			1
the @entity124 even splashed a photo of the two marathon spectators on its front page with the headline , " bag men : feds seek these two pictured at @entity7			0
" the guy in the track suit turned out to be a 17 - year - old suburban @entity80 track star who told @entity134 he was afraid to leave his house because of the scrutiny			2
" we hoped that the crowdsourced search for new information would not spark exactly this type of witch hunt , " @entity1 's @entity21 said at the time			1
" founded in 2005 , @entity1 has become a hugely popular site divided into more than 5,400 communities that have essentially revamped the early @entity145 's bulletin boards , with users posting information , links and thoughts rapidly in real time			1
it has almost 70 million monthly users .			0
