-- a @entity2 entrepreneur is hoping to construct the biggest indoor golf center in the world in the @entity2 which he believes will revolutionize the sport 's leisure industry			1
the vast 18,000 square - meter bubble will house a plethora of golf practice facilities , including chipping greens , bunkers and water hazards			1
the latest golf simulators will offer the choice of the top golf courses in the world , plus a rooftop 34 - bay driving range with the latest high - tech swing analysis			1
add in a golf shop of over 1,000 square meters , a fitness and health center and a five - star hotel , restaurants and business conference facilities and the scale of the project becomes clear			1
the drawback is the â‚¬ 50 million ( $ 66.59 million ) price tag and a prominent site big enough to house a complex bigger than a major football stadium in a densely populated country			1
but @entity32 , who has patented the term @entity34 and hopes to franchise the concept , is unabashed even during a global recession			0
" traditional real estate developments and housing offices are suffering and investors are looking for alternatives in leisure which are becoming an increasingly attractive proposition , " he told @entity0			0
@entity32 also believes that the @entity2 , which has 350,000 golfers and an annual growth rate of over 10 per cent , not to mention excellent transport links to other parts of continental @entity47 , is the ideal location			1
" this is actually meant to put everything that makes golf a way of life under one roof , " he said			2
he told @entity0 that two sites near the @entity56 and @entity57 had been earmarked for the project and said he hoped to begin building in 2012 with " huge interest " among investors from the @entity61			0
the ambitious project also has the backing of the @entity64 of @entity47 and the @entity2 golf federation			1
it is part of a trend which has seen the sport go inside with simulators enabling golfers of all standards to play the world 's classic courses without stepping outside and in all weathers			0
in @entity77 , where courses are at a premium and memberships expensive , the numbers of golf cafes with simulators have grown exponentially while @entity81 - based operator @entity80 told @entity0 it is expanding fast			2
virtual screens replace greens marketing director @entity84 says they have been successful because changes in lifestyle has put leisure time at a premium			2
" if you just want to have a quick game with friends you do n't have to take a whole day out of your diary , you can do it in an hour , " he said			2
@entity95 also believes that indoor operators have removed the barriers to playing at a traditional club			0
" you do n't need to be a member or have a handicap certificate to play , there 's no stuffy dress code or clubhouse rules			0
" but whatever the advantages of indoor golf , will it replace the real thing ? @entity108 , the editor in @entity109 , says that simulators and state - of - the - art indoor centers may indeed replace the traditional driving range , but told @entity0 there was no substitute for the outdoor experience			1
" these places may well but the future of golf practice but as for being the future of golf , i 'm not convinced , " he said			0
" i still think people want to play on a real course and find their ball in real trees ! " he added			0
standing hopes his venture will boost golf standards in his native @entity2 with top players having access to the latest practice facilities , but also believes the model of traditional golf club membership is eroding as more and more players turn to a green fee - pay - and - play game			1
in that context , he believes his venture will flourish and he wants to franchise the idea around the world			0
" @entity34 will be the place to be for every golfer , " boasts the mission statement on the project 's web site , only time will tell whether the bubble will float or burst .			0

planned indoor golf center in the @entity2 would be the biggest of its kind
the center would boast state - of - the - art facilities but carries a price tag of $ 66 million
trends point to growing demand for indoor golf faciliteis or " virtual " golf
traditionalists say golf will remain a *predominantly* outdoor game
