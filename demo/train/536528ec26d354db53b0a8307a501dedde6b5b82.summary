-- authorities say @entity2 , the shadowy " deep web " site shut down by the @entity3 this week , was the @entity5 's biggest destination for drugs and other illegal goods			1
it had nearly 1 million registered users , the bureau says , and was used for roughly $ 1.3 billion in transactions over the past two or so years			2
but shuttering @entity2 and arresting its owner wo n't be the end of the shadowy black market on the @entity15 , where drugs are far from the only products that can be bought illegally			1
the so - called " deep web " consists of sites only accessible using tools like @entity20 , which includes a browser designed to hide the user 's identity by routing their activity through a series of remote connections			1
many sites use intentionally cryptic web addresses -- @entity2 's last was " silkroadfb5piz3r.onion " -- that spread stealthily via word of mouth			1
here is a look at just some of the illegal goods that have been documented as offered for sale on these underground sites			1
( we 're not linking to them , sorry			0
) drugs maybe it should be no big surprise , but hours after @entity2 was shut down , web users were flocking to online forums with one question : " where can i buy my drugs now ? " the answer ? take your pick			1
sites with names like @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 were just some of the ones being mentioned as possibilities			2
another , called @entity62 , had emerged earlier this year as a @entity2 competitor with an aggressive social - media campaign			1
in june , someone claiming to be the site 's owner even conducted an @entity68 ( " @entity68 " ) session on @entity68			0
" we want to bring attention to the site and bring our vendors more buyers , " that person said during the session			0
" law enforcement is going to be aware of us ( and probably already is ) regardless of the way we choose to put our product out there			0
" two weeks ago , @entity62 announced it was shutting down due to " security reasons outside of our control			0
" weapons illegal guns can be found on similar sites , as can legal weapons by people who may not pass a background check or otherwise be allowed to buy them			1
last year , @entity90 reporter @entity89 spent some time on @entity91 , an offshoot of @entity2 devoted to weaponry			1
as part of his reporting , he posed as someone arming a paramilitary group bent on " taking on a 3rd world government organization			0
" the helpful responses poured in			0
" i can provide : tec9 , scorpion , ak47 and one single vietnam war ' thumper ' , but its ammo costs , " read one , the final reference being to a grenade launcher			0
" absolutely , we can accommodate your request , but we need more parameters such as your exact arms needs and destination country , " read another			0
" we only deal with small arms and equipment , but if you need artillery , @entity117 ( man - portable air - defense systems ) , ordinance , @entity119 , helos we do have resources and can make certain introductions for a fee			0
" about a month after the @entity90 piece ran , @entity2 's owner announced it was shutting down @entity91 , citing high prices and lack of interest			1
exotic animals the @entity129 calls the illegal sale of wild animals online " one of the major wildlife conservation challenges of our generation			1
" " the rise of the @entity5 has revolutionized the way we exchange ideas , information and merchandise			0
... " reads a report from the group			0
" however , as a result , the @entity5 is also facilitating the illegal trade in wildlife , which is having a devastating effect on animals , ecosystems and the communities that rely on them worldwide			2
" the report , in which the group tracked activity on 183 websites , documented the sale of elephant ivory , birds of prey , tigers , large snakes and other rare or endangered creatures			2
the relative anonymity the @entity15 provides , combined with a patchwork of laws from state to state and country to country , make policing animal trafficking a tough job , the group said			0
fake documents along with drugs , firearms and solicitations of hackers , @entity2 also had forged documents for sale , the @entity3 said			1
in july , the @entity3 says it intercepted nine false ids bound for @entity178 , who they say is " @entity181 , " the man behind the site			1
" @entity187 " had been soliciting fake identification documents on @entity2 to use in buying more server space for the site			1
it should n't have been hard			2
a simple @entity190 search for fake passports renders websites like @entity193 and @entity194			2
need a " novelty " driver 's license ? several sites offer those , and you can get a diploma and social security card while you 're at it			2
" for your own personal use and amusement , " notes @entity203			0

drugs are n't the only illegal items for sale online
black market sites use " deep web " tools like @entity20 to hide
guns , endangered animals , fake ids all for sale
