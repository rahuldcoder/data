next up for the 17 - time grand slam winner is @entity57 rising star @entity125 , who @entity113 beat in the fourth round of last year 's tournament			1
" i think there 's always excitement about @entity57 playing here , " @entity113 , 31 , told reporters			1
" i played him here last year			0
i played him in @entity134			0
crowds were fair there , too			0
" hopefully we 're going to live up to the expectations and live up to the match			0
hopefully it 's not going to be a bad match			0
i do n't want that to happen			0
