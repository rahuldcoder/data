@entity0 -- @entity2 was born to be an actress			1
@entity2 says that navigating the maze of government aid regulations is a challenge			1
she was also , however , born with osteogenesis imperfecta , a bone - crippling disorder that can mean a lifetime of health problems and physical disability			1
but rather than letting her condition hinder her acting ambitions , @entity12 has embraced it , and now works to encourage other actors with disabilities to do the same			1
as the artistic director of @entity20 , a theater founded to " showcase professional artists with disabilities in an integrated setting , " @entity12 offers her actors respite from the challenges they face , and access to an industry that can often discriminate against people like her			1
" i decided a long time ago that if people were going to stare at me , they were going to pay me for it , " she quipped backstage at a rehearsal for her latest production , " is there anybody out there ? " and at a height of just under 4 feet , with legs encased in metal braces , the 38 - year - old @entity12 said she indeed often attracts curious stares from the public			1
@entity12 's condition , also known as @entity44 , is a genetic disorder " characterized by fragile bones that break easily , " according to the @entity46			1
the condition is considered rare , thought to affect only about 40,000 @entity49 , said @entity50 , ceo of the @entity51			0
there is no cure , @entity50 said			0
while the severity of the disorder varies greatly , common health issues related to @entity51 are a short stature , weak tissues , fragile skin , muscle weakness , loose joints , hearing loss , breathing problems and curvature of the spine , according to the @entity51			2
in @entity12 's case , @entity51 has meant frequent bone fractures , painful surgeries , leg braces , wheelchairs , and a multitude of symptoms caused by the pressure her weak frame puts on her body			1
as a child , @entity12 had to have rods surgically placed in her legs " as infrastructure " -- a painful routine that she repeated as often as she grew			2
but for @entity12 , the physical constraints of her condition are only half the battle			2
when @entity12 was forced to retire from her job as an accessibility specialist at the @entity91 because she was too sick to work , she lost her work - provided private health insurance coverage			1
she now gets @entity94 through her @entity96 retirement benefits			0
@entity96 is a government program that " makes monthly payments to people who have low income and few resources , " and are either at least 65 years of age or disabled			2
@entity96 recipients are subject to income restrictions depending on what state they live in , and are only allowed to have resources worth $ 2,000 , with certain exceptions , according to the @entity96 web site ( www.socialsecurity.gov )			0
these strict financial eligibility limitations , @entity12 said , can be nerve - wracking , and can make navigating the system extremely difficult			1
" if you lose your @entity96 benefits because you make too much money , you lose everything			0
you lose your @entity94 , too , " @entity12 said			2
" so if you 're on disability you have to be really careful not to make too much money , which is self - defeating			2
" it is " self - defeating " especially when one considers the massive medical bills @entity12 accumulates due to her @entity51			1
though @entity94 covers 80 percent of her medical costs , @entity12 said she often comes up short some months			2
" you ca n't get blood from a stone			0
... i 'm on a fixed income			0
that 's why i 'm on @entity94 , " she said			0
so , @entity12 constantly finds herself in the precarious situation of having to rely on her loved ones and the government for her financial stability			1
" i 'm hanging on by my fingernails			0
... you can never get ahead , " she said			0
it 's a frustrating circumstance familiar to @entity12 's fellow actors at @entity20 , as well as to the millions of disabled @entity49 in need of expensive medical treatment			1
it 's a system , said @entity12 , that must be reformed			1
" it 's a foreign concept to me			0
... this idea that ' no , i 'm sorry you do n't have enough money to get this treatment , ' " she said			0
" i sincerely believe that people with disabilities , if you want them to be at all a useful part of the society , you need to have medical care that you do n't have to worry about having			0
" but until then , @entity12 said she survives by familiarizing herself with the system and learning to navigate through the obstacles , a skill that she was forced to learn early on			2
" you just get used to adapting			0
i guess we always do that anyway , " she said .			0
