@entity0 -- an advocacy group for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered @entity4 -- have made three pilgrimages to the @entity6 , under three different popes			1
but only once have they been treated like @entity8			0
that 's the treatment the roughly 50 members of the @entity12 - based group got -- much to their surprise -- for @entity15 ' weekly address wednesday in @entity16 , according to @entity17 , the group 's executive director			1
" it 's really an incredible honor and an incredible step forward for the lgbt community to be recognized , " he told @entity1 from @entity20			2
@entity17 would still like to see more changes from the @entity27 hierarchy and the @entity28 , like shifts in their official positions in support of same - sex marriage and adoption of children by gay and lesbian couples			0
and even wednesday , @entity37 was recognized simply as a lay group of @entity4 , not one that speaks for the lgbt community			1
the @entity6 did n't grant members ' request for a special private audience with @entity15 , nor did anyone acknowledge their calling out to him that " we are gay and lesbian @entity4 , " @entity17 said			1
still , the fact that they were recognized at all was a positive for the @entity37 leader			0
so , too , was their special seating wednesday -- on the same level as the @entity15 , something they did n't know about until they got their tickets ( which were arranged by @entity56 officials ) on tuesday night			1
this experience was much different for @entity37 , which has been around for 38 years , than its earlier @entity56 visits when @entity59 and @entity60 were in office			0
" we were basically ignored by them , " @entity17 said			0
" so not just to be acknowledged , but to be acknowledged in such an honorable way , is ( good )			0
" not much about the @entity4 's official stances on @entity39 issues has changed since @entity15 bishop @entity15 became @entity15 in march 2013			1
but there has been a noticeable shift in tone			0
this became evident a few months after @entity15 ' election , when he was asked during a wide - ranging news conference about his stance on gays and lesbians , including gay priests			1
" if someone is gay and he searches for the @entity78 and has good will , who am i to judge ? " the @entity15 said			2
a few months later , @entity15 said church officials have the right to express opinions but not to " interfere spiritually " in the lives of gays and lesbians			2
this reflected his larger push to make the church more welcoming and open , and less focused on sometimes divisive social issues			0
speaking about this shift , @entity17 said @entity15 " has given people a lot of hope , ( though ) i do n't think he 's a pope that 's going to make the big changes that we 'd like to see			1
" " but , " @entity17 added , " he is a pope who is opening up a discussion			2

a @entity100 - based ministry for @entity39 @entity4 attends pope @entity15 ' weekly address
they get *vip* seating from the @entity6 , the group 's executive director says
he adds : pope @entity15 may not shift *policies* , but he is " opening up a discussion "
