@entity0 , @entity1 -- despite all the questions surrounding the war in @entity6 , congressional democrats have not challenged the administration 's policies since president @entity9 announced a surge of troops in 2009			1
the release of classified documents about the war by the website @entity15 seemed to have no impact on @entity18			1
the same week that the documents were released , the @entity19 approved legislation with almost no debate that will provide tens of billions of dollars for the war effort			2
even though the @entity25 is chaired by @entity26 , who entered the national spotlight in the 1970s with his riveting testimony before the @entity29 about the problems with the war in @entity32 , the panel has been relatively quiescent			1
@entity33 do n't want @entity6 to become a political problem for @entity9			1
their party is having enough trouble as a result of the recession and the deficit that they do n't want to give their opponents one more issue to run on			0
democrats , who have suffered for decades when being attacked as " weak on defense , " also fear that any questions about the war will open them up to those attacks again			0
but @entity33 who have doubts about the war ca n't afford to be silent			1
when @entity54 does n't publicly ask tough questions of the @entity19 , poor decisions have often ensued			1
the decision over funding @entity6 came one week before the the 46th anniversary of the passage of the @entity59 on august 7 , 1964			0
on august 2 , 1964 , the @entity60 attacked the @entity61			0
two days later , there were reports of another attack , although there were doubts at the time that the incident occurred			0
president @entity69 used the reports of the attacks to call on @entity54 to grant him authority to take action			1
as @entity75 presidential candidate @entity74 was criticizing the administration 's @entity32 policies , @entity69 requested a congressional resolution authorizing him to take " all necessary measures to repeal any armed attacks against the forces of the @entity82			1
" @entity54 passed the @entity59 on august 7			1
the @entity19 unanimously supported the measure , and in the @entity29 the vote was 88 - 2			0
he watched his poll numbers rise			0
the resolution , according to @entity69 , was like grandma 's nightshirt , because it " covered everything			1
" there were many people in the summer of 1964 who were warning the president to avoid escalating the war in @entity32			1
most remarkable was the intensity of the opposition in @entity54 that came from across the political spectrum			2
the criticism came from all sources			0
@entity33 such as @entity100 of @entity101 said the intervention was dangerous and unnecessary			2
senate majority leader @entity103 had asked the president , " what national interests in @entity106 would steel the @entity82 people for the massive costs of an ever - deepening involvement of that kind ? " @entity113 @entity112 @entity111 , certainly no leftist radical , complained that he had been all over @entity18 and could n't find any legislators who thought , " we ought to fight a war in that area of the world			2
" the journalist @entity118 quipped : " it is beginning to look as if the @entity33 plan to be their own most vigorous critics in this year 's election debate			1
" the most trenchant warnings came from one of the most hawkish members of @entity54 , @entity126 democrat @entity125 , @entity69 's mentor in the 1950s and the leading figure in the @entity129 caucus			1
on may 27 , 1964 , @entity125 had called @entity32 the " damn worst mess i ever saw " and said he felt that " the more we try to do for them , the less they are willing to do for themselves			0
" when confronted with proposals to withdraw forces from @entity32 , @entity69 could not stop thinking about the high political price democrats had paid in the 1950s because of @entity75 accusations about not being tough against communism			0
he hesitantly accepted the analysis of hawkish advisors like @entity143 , who said that if @entity32 fell to communism , so would the rest of the region			0
" i 'm not going to lose @entity32 , " @entity69 told his ambassador to @entity32 , @entity75 @entity148			0
" i am not going to be the president who saw @entity106 go the way @entity151 went			0
" the months surrounding the @entity59 were a test , not just for @entity54 but for @entity69			2
confronted with trenchant criticism of escalation , he decided to ignore these voices in favor of more hawkish advisors in his inner circle			0
in 2010 , there are many politicians , defense experts and military officials who are warning that the president needs to rethink @entity82 strategy in @entity6			2
the @entity15 documents pointed to issues that have been known for some time			2
many experts are skeptical that the @entity82 will be able to stick to the 2011 withdrawal deadline ( indeed , many administration officials equivocated on this promise as soon as it announced ) , and there is ample evidence that the current war strategy will not produce an @entity6 that remains free from @entity82 's adversaries			1
as @entity178 , former @entity179 administration official and foreign policy expert , wrote in @entity181 : " the war the @entity82 is now fighting in @entity6 is not succeeding and is not worth waging this way			0
... @entity6 is claiming too many @entity82 lives , requiring too much attention , and absorbing too many resources			0
" democrats ca n't continue to write a blank check for this president			1
they must use the power of oversight and investigation to start addressing the problems with the war strategy and to create pressure on the administration to strengthen its military plans for the coming year			1
they ca n't simply trust the president do just to the right thing			0
too often , when @entity54 has remained silent , presidents have made huge mistakes -- and it has taken decades for the nation to recover			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			2

@entity205 : @entity15 *disclosures* *stirred* hardly any *reaction* in @entity54
he says @entity33 are trying to avoid adding to @entity9 's problems
@entity214 resolution was a case of @entity54 giving president blank check , he says
@entity205 : @entity54 needs to use its powers to question whether war strategy is the right one
