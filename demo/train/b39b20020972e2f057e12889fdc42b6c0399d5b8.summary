@entity0 , @entity1 -- as soon as he heard the news about @entity6 's earthquake , @entity3 began planning to get himself and two fellow power specialists from the @entity8 into the heart of the disaster zone			1
on january 16 , four days after the 7.0 - magnitude quake had flattened much of @entity13 and killed more than 200,000 people , the three engineers flew into the @entity15 , then drove into @entity6 's capital , parked their truck in front of the @entity20 embassy -- where they figured they 'd be safe -- and went to sleep			1
they would need it -- the city was dark , except for a few lights from private generators , and they knew their expertise would be in demand beginning the next morning			0
here 's what they found : all four power plants serving the city were off line ; power lines lay on the ground all over the place ; the earthquake had tossed 56 - ton transformers from their bases			1
" they literally jumped up 10 inches and tipped over , " said @entity38 , 61 , a @entity39 native and former @entity41 volunteer			0
after finding $ 65 - per - night rooms in a two - story , wooden hotel that had survived the earthquake , the men set about trying to find out how much of electricity of @entity6 's ( @entity48 ) system of substations and generators had also survived			1
but they found that the power system had already been in extremis			2
before january 12 , only 60 percent of @entity13 's 3 million residents had electricity ; nationwide , the figure was 40 percent , @entity38 said			1
many of them were simply stealing it , tapping lines feeding streetlights			2
before the quake , the capital had 60,000 paying customers , but there were 150,000 connections to the grid , and the power company was losing $ 1 million to $ 2 million per month , he said			1
" in @entity6 , that 's a lot of money , " he said			1
he credited donations from @entity72 president @entity71 for having kept @entity6 's lights on			1
now , to get them on again , @entity38 faced the task of replacing thousands of poles , many of which had been crushed by toppling buildings			0
@entity38 and his colleagues , @entity81 and @entity82 , worked to get live lines to critical sites , like hospitals , water pumping stations and grocery stores			2
the men had at their disposal four trucks and 30 @entity48 workers , some of whom had lost their own families			0
as they went to work , the engineers carted what they could from the power company 's warehouse , which had been condemned and was to be torn down			2
but there were n't enough poles , lines and other equipment needed to reilluminate a city the size of @entity13 , he said			2
nor were there any maps that would tell the engineers where the wires went once they left the plant			0
so they gave their teams gps units and created the nation 's first maps of its electrical grids , @entity38 said			0
the @entity6 workers were inventive with the tools they had -- primarily pickup trucks carrying ladders -- but they had a view of safety that concerned their @entity20 counterparts			1
" safety is not a primary concern in the @entity6 electric sector , " @entity38 said			2
" it would scare you to death			0
" few wore basics , like hard hats , safety goggles or gloves , he said			0
@entity38 recalled a 1970s - vintage @entity137 truck that had been donated by one of their @entity20 - based cooperatives to the @entity15 to help restore electricity after @entity142 knocked out power nationwide in 1998			1
he made a couple of calls and found it sitting in a garage on the @entity15 side of the island , paid a mechanic to get it running again , and had it driven to @entity6			1
that -- combined with two other trucks from the @entity15 and four other @entity6 line trucks that " sort of work " and were already in the country -- was it for the specialized equipment needed to make rapid line repairs			1
the rest of the work is being done by people using pickup trucks and ladders , he said			0
they got the first of the capital 's four plants back on line within 10 days of the earthquake , he said			1
the first place to get electricity restored was @entity175 , outside of which stacked bodies oozed fluids onto the paving stones			0
his biggest challenge was keeping his footing			0
" lord , do n't let me fall on the bodies , " he recalled telling himself , his voice cracking			0
now , slightly more than a month after the earthquake , service has been restored to 25 percent of @entity6 's customers , he said			1
two of the city 's four power plants are back on line , and a third is nearly ready , he said			1
@entity38 appealed wednesday to a nationwide convention of the @entity8 in @entity0 for help getting teams of workers and trucks to @entity6			2
" if we can get four or five teams , that would help a lot , " he said			0
" the international community is going to have to come forward now			0
" @entity38 's experience with the topic goes back to 1972 , when he was a @entity41 volunteer in @entity206 , @entity207 , and an earthquake destroyed the center of the city , killing thousands			0
but things have improved since then			0
three weeks after that quake , the city still had no electricity , he said .			2

engineers fly from @entity20 to @entity15 4 days after quake , drive to @entity6
they find 4 power plants off line , power lines down , 56 - ton transformers off their bases
before the quake , only 60 ***%*** of capital 's residents had electricity ; 40 ***%*** nationwide
with scant safety supplies and tools , team and @entity6 restore service to 25 ***%*** of customers
