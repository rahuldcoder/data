-- the people of @entity2 , @entity3 , on saturday are remembering a tragedy that convulsed the nation one year ago			1
a socially awkward young man walked into @entity7 with a rifle on december 14 , 2012			2
@entity9 gunned down 20 children , ages 6 and 7 , and six adults at the school			1
the people in this community of 28,000 in the southwest part of the state hope to grieve in private			0
town leaders have asked the news media to stay away			1
" there 's an emotional and economic toll that we pay when the media descends on us , so we ask for your forbearance after today and respectfully request that you allow us a time of peace and quiet , " said @entity19 , the town 's first selectman , a role similar to that of mayor			1
in @entity34 , president @entity32 and the first lady observed a moment of silence and lit candles in honor of those lost in the massacre			1
@entity32 devoted his weekly address on saturday to the one - year anniversary of the shooting			1
" as parents , as @entity46 , the news filled us with grief , " @entity32 said in his address			1
" @entity2 is a town like so many of our hometowns			1
the victims were educators and kids that could have been any of our own			0
and our hearts were broken for the families that lost a piece of their heart ; for the communities changed forever ; for the survivors , so young , whose innocence was torn away far too soon			2
" @entity32 honored the " impossibly brave " @entity2 parents " who stepped forward in the hopes that they might spare others their heartbreak			1
and they were joined by millions of @entity46 -- mothers and fathers ; sisters and brothers -- who refused to accept these acts of violence as somehow inevitable			0
" " over the past year , their voices have sustained us			2
and their example has inspired us -- to be better parents and better neighbors ; to give our children everything they need to face the world without fear ; to meet our responsibilities not just to our own families , but to our communities			2
more than the tragedy itself , that 's how @entity2 will be remembered , " @entity32 said			1
many news organizations said they 'll honor that request by not reporting in the city of @entity2 itself , but that was before friday 's shooting at @entity97 in @entity98			1
the news value of @entity2 has gone up			1
@entity0 will air a documentary about @entity2 at 7 p.m. et on saturday			1
media vow to remember @entity2 tragedy in respectful manner nobody knows why @entity9 , 20 , killed the children and adults at the school , his mother at the home they shared , and himself			1
he had attended the school briefly , but that was years ago			2
last month , @entity3 's state attorney 's office released its official report that tried to piece together what happened			0
the investigation provided some insights into the life and actions of the gunman , but his motive remains a mystery			2
the report suggested that improving the delivery of mental health care to those with chronic mental illness may be an important element in reducing certain acts of violence , and that mass shooters are not " enthralled " with violent video games			0
after @entity2 , mental health gains prominence in gun debate the unanswered questions deepen the tragedy of @entity2 , the second - deadliest school shooting in @entity46 history , following the april 2007 slaying of 32 people at @entity140 the shootings also caused a renewal of the debate over gun control			2
@entity32 addressed that issue in his saturday remarks			2
" we have n't yet done enough to make our communities and our country safer			0
we have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily			0
we have to do more to heal troubled minds			0
we have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved , and valued , and cared for , " he said			0
" as a nation , we ca n't stop every act of violence			0
we ca n't heal every troubled mind			0
but if we want to live in a country where we can go to work , send our kids to school , and walk our streets free from fear , we have to keep trying			0
we have to keep caring			0
we have to treat every child like they 're our child			0
like those in @entity7 , we must choose love			0
and together , we must make a change			0
