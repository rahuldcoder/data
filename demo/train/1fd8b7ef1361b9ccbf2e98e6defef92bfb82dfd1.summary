while the world has been focused on eliminating @entity4 's chemical weapons , a vicious war within a war has gained momentum in northern @entity4			1
it is a complex conflict that pits @entity8 affiliates against more moderate rebel factions and against @entity4 's 2 - million strong @entity11 minority			1
but it also threatens to spill far beyond @entity4 's borders			0
the largest @entity11 group -- the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) -- raised the stakes last week by declaring the autonomous region of " western @entity16 " in a part of @entity4 that normally produces about one - third of the country 's oil			1
other rebel factions condemned the move as a step toward a declaration of independence and the breakup of @entity4			0
the opposition @entity26 said the @entity13 and its allies represented " a separatist movement , disavowing any relationship between themselves and the @entity4 people , who are struggling for a united nation independent and free from tyranny			2
" what happens in this region is of acute concern to the governments of @entity38 and @entity39 , and to the @entity42 of northern @entity39 , all of which have their own interests and allies there			1
for the regime of @entity4 president @entity47 , @entity11 success at the expense of the @entity50 and @entity51 is the least worst outcome , dividing the opposition and depriving its main adversaries of an operational hinterland			2
the government retains military outposts in places like @entity59 , the largest @entity11 city , in what appears to be a tacit understanding with the @entity42			2
@entity4 has now become a patchwork of fiefdoms , with villages and border crossings changing hands and shifting alliances among opposition groups : yet another obstacle for the @entity70 and other countries trying to kick - start a political process in @entity4			1
the @entity13 is demanding its own place at the table in any peace negotiations as the @entity42 ' representative			2
a growing threat from @entity78 on the battlefield , the @entity13 has focused its firepower on the @entity8 - affiliated @entity78 ( @entity78 ) , driving it out of several border villages and taking control of areas along the @entity4 border with @entity39			1
@entity11 " popular protection units " now control the crossing into @entity39 at @entity86 , potentially giving the @entity42 an opportunity to export oil and gain revenue			1
the crossing is on the main highway to @entity93 and @entity94			0
@entity78 is far from down and out , however			0
it has vastly expanded its presence in northern @entity4 this year thanks to an influx of hundreds of foreign fighters			2
in october , @entity78 seized the town of @entity99 on the @entity4 - @entity38 border after heavy clashes with the @entity50 's @entity102			1
it accused the brigade of being in league with @entity11 " separatists " and warned the @entity50 " not to be dragged into what is planned by them for the enemies who plot day and night , and seek by all means to pit these factions and the @entity112 against one another			0
" @entity78 also seized the @entity115 crossing on the @entity38 border from an @entity50 brigade , giving it the ability to bring in weapons and other supplies			2
@entity78 has gained a gruesome reputation for torturing and murdering prisoners taken during clashes with other rebel factions			0
a video posted by the @entity4 observatory on saturday showed several @entity50 fighters who had been tortured and killed ; the mediator sent to negotiate for their release was also reportedly murdered			0
@entity129 , director of the @entity130 at the @entity131 , writes that according to one former prisoner , the @entity78 " emir " in @entity99 is a 16 - year - old who has personally taken part in the torture of captives			0
recognizing the growing threat from @entity78 , the @entity26 has accused it of " aggression towards @entity4 revolutionary forces and indifference to the lives of the @entity4 people			0
" islamist groups form alliance another @entity8 affiliate , the @entity146 , is also involved in this mosaic of conflict			0
it has been trying to take control of areas north and east of @entity152 , @entity4 's largest city , attacking @entity11 villages in the process			1
but @entity146 and @entity78 appear to loathe each other as much as they do the @entity157 rebel groups			0
@entity129 , who runs the blog @entity129 , says @entity146 and another @entity160 group , @entity159 , " are working together more closely than ever both to counter @entity78 and to take power from weaker factions of the @entity50			0
" it 's another sign that the @entity4 opposition continues to fracture on the battlefield but also that @entity146 needs allies as it seeks to take on @entity78 and the @entity42			1
@entity11 militias , in turn , have evicted @entity146 from several villages along the @entity38 border in recent weeks			1
but human rights activists claim the @entity42 have also targeted @entity174 villages			0
at a local level at least , ethnic cleansing appears to be redrawing the map of northern @entity4			0
the @entity13 insists it does not want to see the breakup of @entity4 , nor ethnic conflict			0
but as in @entity39 10 years ago , the @entity42 in @entity4 sense an opportunity to right old wrongs , and especially reverse the @entity182 of @entity11 areas decreed by @entity47 's father			1
in the 1970s , @entity185 essentially rendered the @entity42 stateless and encouraged @entity174 to settle in areas bordering @entity38 , such as @entity188 province			2
about 60,000 @entity42 were displaced in the process			0
writing in the current edition of the @entity193 's @entity192 , @entity190 says " @entity188 presents a complex human terrain where conflict is driven by the patchwork authority of the @entity4 military and local and long - standing communal antagonism			0
... @entity188 's oil resources are also important and a source of frequent conflict between @entity174 and @entity11 armed groups			0
" @entity190 sees an opportunity for the @entity11 militia in @entity188 province , if it protects minorities there			0
but it will , he writes , " need to continue to demonstrate battlefield successes against its antagonists , primarily @entity212 armed groups such as the @entity214 - jihadi organizations and tribal militias			0
" @entity8 - linked group strengthens hold in northern @entity4 spillover into @entity38 , northern @entity39 @entity38 is already seeing fighting between the @entity42 and other groups spill into its territory , with errant rocket fire killing several @entity38 civilians over the past few months			1
@entity38 forces have responded with howitzers , and @entity38 authorities have begun building a border wall in several areas along the 820 - kilometer ( 510 - mile ) border with @entity4			1
@entity231 does n't want to see either @entity8 or the @entity42 prevail in northern @entity4			1
beset with its own @entity11 problem , it has no desire to see the @entity13 emerge as the dominant player			0
the @entity13 has long been an ally of the @entity11 @entity237 ( @entity238 ) in @entity38 , which has fought a guerrilla war against the @entity38 state for nearly 30 years			1
there is now a fragile truce while negotiations on a political settlement stutter on , but should those negotiations fail , the @entity238 could use @entity4 's implosion to its advantage			0
activists in northern @entity4 say hundreds of @entity238 fighters have already crossed the border			2
the @entity38 government has tentatively reached out to the @entity13 , whose leader @entity252 visited @entity231 in july			0
but in subsequent interviews , he has accused @entity38 of helping other @entity11 groups against the @entity13 and allowing @entity160 militants to cross from @entity38 into @entity4 , accusations denied by @entity231			1
@entity259 told @entity260 this weekend that the @entity38 " are trying to divide the @entity42 by bringing certain ( @entity11 ) parties into the @entity262			1
" the @entity42 of northern @entity39 have also been pulled into @entity4 's war , not least because the fighting has pushed tens of thousands of @entity42 across the border			1
there were just under 200,000 @entity4 registered in refugee camps in northern @entity39 in late october , according to @entity268 , the great majority of them @entity42			1
the support of the @entity11 regional government for brethren over the border has brought a swift response from @entity8 , which carried out two suicide bomb attacks in the @entity39 - @entity11 capital , @entity277 , in september , killing several people			1
the @entity39 @entity11 leader , @entity279 , responded by warning : " we will not hesitate in directing strikes ( against ) the terrorist criminals in any place			2
" but at the same time , @entity279 is wary of the @entity13 's ambitions and has been trying to unite other @entity11 groups as a counterweight against it			0
@entity279 has invested heavily in a good working relationship with @entity38 -- seeing it as a route for exporting oil from northern @entity39 -- and has no desire to see the @entity13 provoke @entity231			1
after its declaration of autonomy , @entity279 accused the @entity13 of being in league with @entity47 and of wrecking a golden opportunity for @entity11 unity in @entity4			2
he was in the @entity38 city of @entity300 on saturday to meet @entity38 prime minister @entity301 and back his negotiations with @entity38 's @entity42			2
the @entity304 - dominated @entity39 government in @entity94 has other concerns , especially about @entity8 's new freedom of action in @entity4			1
the scale and frequency of @entity8 attacks inside @entity39 have increased , with the violence there now at its worst since 2007			2
@entity78 now has a rear base in northern @entity4 from which to plan attacks in @entity39 , and it may have the support or at least tolerance of several powerful @entity212 tribes that straddle the border			1
whatever happens around @entity321 and in other theaters in @entity4 , the northeast threatens to become a vortex of conflict into which different @entity4 groups , foreign fighters and outside powers are inexorably dragged			0
inside @entity4 town living under @entity8 reign of fear			2

amid civil war , @entity8 affiliates are fighting more moderate rebels in north @entity4
governments of @entity38 and @entity39 , and the @entity42 of northern @entity39 , have interests and allies there
@entity11 group has declared an autonomous region , drawing *criticism* from other rebels
area villages , border crossings change hands , and alliances shift , *complicating* peace efforts
