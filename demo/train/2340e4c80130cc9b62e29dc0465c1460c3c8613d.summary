-- few female @entity2 artists have attained the level of international recognition that sculptor @entity5 enjoys			1
her work has been exhibited in @entity8 and throughout @entity9			1
she was the subject of a recent joint survey show at the @entity11			2
she was one of four winners of this year 's @entity15 competition and was also recently featured in @entity17 vogue			2
@entity5 first garnered attention for her sculptures of women			1
working in porcelain , bronze and fiberglass , her figures are often nude , slouching , and wearing vacant or depressed expressions			2
" your body , " a 2.6 - meter - high fiberglass sculpture made in 2005 was collected by the @entity27			1
a seated , slouching and vacant - eyed nude woman with a scar on her abdomen , sagging breasts and fat rolls , critic @entity35 , a dean at the @entity36 , has described the work as an expression of " fatigue ... emptiness and helplessness			1
" the effect of @entity5 's work is often disquieting , even though her figures are recognizable			1
according to curator and critic @entity55 , @entity5 's " sense of social satire is anchored in the commonplace , in the daily exigencies and social exchanges of an ordinary woman 's life , in the small vanities , frauds and violations			1
" @entity5 says her work is always a kind of ongoing philosophical inquiry			1
" from the day we are born , we have many , many questions -- all kinds of questions from what we see , what we experience and what we know			2
" i think art is possibly one of the ways , one of the channels , to help us to find out certain truths , " she says			2
her sculptures of women , for instance , are an attempt " to deal with everything that had to do with female existence			1
" but , she says , " after a while , if you work on a deeper level , you will discover that whether male or female , you 're ultimately dealing with human nature			1
in other words , the deeper you go , you move further away from gender but you get closer to human nature			2
" more than gender politics , she is interested in human relationships			2
" individuals are in fact very alien , very distant to each other			1
however , as we 're collective animals , social animals , we all end up in a kind of a relationship ... i think we 're like two neighboring islands , gradually getting close to each other			2
" more from @entity100 : from builder to @entity103 - winning architect raised in @entity104 by an editor and film studio director , @entity5 studied at @entity104 's @entity107 , graduating in 1995			1
one of the first artists to make an impression on her was @entity111 , a sculptor from @entity112 whose work @entity5 first saw when she was at high school			1
it was the first time she had seen sculpture that was n't a politically - freighted monument or memorial , she says			2
" he had created an emotional state of human beings			0
" but @entity5 's process is too personal to be inspired by anyone or anything else			1
in fact , she rejects the notion of inspiration altogether			0
" i do n't think art is like design , when one can have an inspiration here or an inspiration there			0
" " art is more the expression of your points of view , or whatever you want to express in the long process of your understanding -- often it has a very long thread throughout			0
" every three years , @entity5 puts on a solo show containing series of works that represent a particular line of questioning , she says			1
typically , she draws a rough sketch with measurements marked in , which her assistants use as the basis for creating a steel framework			0
@entity5 then uses clay to shape a form , from which a plaster mold is created , which she then paints			1
the production phase is physically exhausting for @entity5			1
" every time when i work on something , i would eat very little and sleep very little and become very , very thin			2
" but , she says , " the most challenging part of the whole creation is the initial thinking process , " something she describes as " painful , " even " torturing			0
" " the actual work ... i can complete it within a year or a year and a half			2
but before that , i have to think for a long , long time ... trying hard to convince myself			0
" she says she does n't use photographs or work from models : " it all comes from my head			2
" although her sculptures are strikingly lifelike , @entity5 says she is n't aiming for realism			1
" if you put a real person 's face next to it , you will see a lot of differences			0
but what matters to me is ... the poignance of the expression			0
" " i want my art to awaken the sensibility of each onlooker , to awaken his body , so that his body can experience the sculpture			0
that 's why i really want people to stand right in front of my sculpture , to face ( it )			0
" more from @entity100 : top designer shares secret of staying in vogue @entity5 knows she is living in an interesting period of @entity2 history			1
" i was born in 1968			0
we 've gone through the @entity203 , then the @entity205 period , then the recent years of rapid economic growth			0
" these have been the decades when @entity2 has gone through the most dramatic , the fastest changes ever			0
and contemporary @entity2 art has been born and developed within these last 30 years			0
" what that means for @entity5 personally is not yet clear , though			1
being thrown into the cross currents of history is , she says , " good fortune " on one hand , but she also says , " i 'm not very adaptable			0
" in fact , an artist heralded by critics and collectors as exemplary of exciting new developments in a still - developing world , says she often feels out of step			1
" i feel that i 'm gradually becoming more and more alien to this era , as i feel that the world has become more and more extrovert , more and more superficial			1
" it 's become ever so easy to know , to see and to experience too many things			0
the ways for us to get to know the world have become more and more diverse			0
there are more and more channels ... and more and more platforms			0
" people have become ... more and more extroverted			0
however , i think there should be another part that should look inward ... into an inner world ... a world that exists within us			0
and this world is n't small at all			0
in fact , it can be enormous			0

@entity5 attracted international attention with her large - scale sculptures of women
her work is held by the @entity27 and has been exhibited throughout @entity9 .
her sculptures are the result of ongoing philosophical inquiry , @entity5 says .
although representative of a new generation of artists , @entity5 says she feels alien to our *information* era .
