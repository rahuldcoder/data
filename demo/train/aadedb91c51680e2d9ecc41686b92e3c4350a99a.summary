editor 's note : @entity3 writer @entity2 is the author of more than 35 books of poetry , fiction and nonfiction			1
her novels include " @entity9 " and " @entity10 , " which won the @entity11 in 2000			2
her new book , published this week by @entity13 , is " payback : debt and the @entity15			1
" @entity2 says the book " is not a practical guide about how to get out of debt			1
instead it examines the underpinnings of the whole structure -- why we human beings have such a thing as a debt - credit system in the first place			1
" @entity2 says we 've come to feel that debt is essential to our lives			1
( @entity28 ) -- unless we value fairness , reciprocity , and honest dealing , and the concept of balances -- for debt and credit depend on them -- and unless we are able to trust our systems , we would not be able to have debt and credit -- no one would lend , because there would be no expectation of ever getting paid back			1
what caused the massive financial mess we are in comes back ultimately to these concepts			2
the rules were too loose , fairness and honest dealing were violated , the balance was upset			1
we must now restore trust so people will take their pennies out of the sock under the mattress where they are now inclined to store them			1
in my part of the world we have a ritual interchange that goes like this : first person : " lovely weather we 're having			2
" second person : " we 'll pay for it later			0
" my part of the world being @entity3 , where there is a great deal of weather , we always do pay for it later			0
one person has commented , " that 's not @entity3 , it 's just presbyterian			0
" nevertheless , it 's a widespread saying among us			0
what this ritual interchange reveals is a larger habit of thinking about the more enjoyable things in life : they 're only on loan or acquired on credit , and sooner or later the date when they must be paid for will roll around			0
it 's pay - up time			0
or payback time , supposing that you have n't paid up			1
in any case , the time when whatever is on one side of the balance is weighed against whatever is on the other side -- whether it 's your heart , your soul or your debts -- and the final reckoning is made			1
the financial world has recently been shaken as a result of the collapse of a debt pyramid involving something called " subprime mortgages " -- a pyramid scheme that most people do n't grasp very well , but that boils down to the fact that some large financial institutions peddled mortgages to people who could not possibly pay the monthly rates and then put this snake - oil debt into cardboard boxes with impressive labels on them and sold them to institutions and hedge funds that thought they were worth something			1
a friend of mine from the @entity118 writes : " i used to have three banks and a mortgage company			1
bank number one bought the other two and is now trying hard to buy the mortgage company , which is bankrupt , only it was revealed this morning that the last bank standing is also in serious trouble			0
" now they are trying to renegotiate with the mortgage company			0
question one : if your company is going broke , why would you want to buy a company whose insolvency is front - page news ? question two : if all the lenders go broke , will the borrowers get off the hook ? " you ca n't imagine the chagrin of the credit - loving @entity118			1
i gather that whole neighborhoods in the @entity141 look like neighborhoods in my hometown , empty houses with knee - high grass and vines growing over them and no one willing to admit they actually own the place			0
down we go , about to reap what we sow			0
" which has a nice biblical ring to it , but still we scratch our heads			0
how and why did this happen ? the answer i hear quite often -- " greed " -- may be accurate enough , but it does n't go very far toward unveiling the deeper mysteries of the process			1
what is this " debt " by which we 're so bedeviled ? like air , it 's all around us , but we never think about it unless something goes wrong with the supply			1
certainly it 's a thing we 've come to feel is indispensable to our collective buoyancy			0
in good times we float around on it as if on a helium - filled balloon ; we rise higher and higher , and the balloon gets bigger and bigger , until -- poof ! -- some killjoy sticks a pin into it and we sink			0
but what is the nature of that pin ? another friend of mine used to maintain that airplanes stayed up in the air only because people believed -- against reason -- that they could fly : without that collective delusion sustaining them , they would instantly plummet to earth			1
is " debt " similar ? in other words , perhaps debt exists because we imagine it			2
another part of the human imaginative debt / credit structure has to do with payback time -- the time when you have to pay the debt back , or else suffer the consequences			2
all major religions have extended this structure to the afterlife , where , if you have n't righted the moral balances on earth , you must do so after death			2
there are no clocks in heaven			2
nor are there any in hell			2
in both , everything is always now			0
or so goes the rumor			0
in heaven , there are no debts -- all have been paid , one way or another -- but in hell there 's nothing but debts , and a great deal of payment is exacted , though you ca n't ever get all paid up			1
you have to pay , and pay , and keep on paying			0
@entity223 is like an infernal maxed - out credit card that multiplies the charges endlessly			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity2 : rules of fair dealing were violated in the growth of debt
we have to restore trust so people are willing to put their money in banks , she says
@entity2 : debt is like air ; we do n't notice it until it *disappears*
in heaven , there are no debts , while hell is nothing but debts , @entity2 says
