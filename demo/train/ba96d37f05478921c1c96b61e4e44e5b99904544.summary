editor 's note : @entity2 is currently @entity3 at the @entity4 at the @entity5 and @entity6 and holocaust studies at @entity8			1
she is the author of " @entity9 : my day in @entity10 with a @entity11			1
" for more information , read here @entity2 was preparing to give a lecture on @entity11 when the shooting began			1
@entity16 ( @entity17 ) -- i write this from my office in the @entity4 at the @entity5 where i have been privileged to have had a fellowship for the past semester			1
up until wednesday at 12:50 p.m. , it had been a perfect visit			1
everything a scholar could hope for : exceptional scholarly resources and a magnificent museum staff			1
when i arrive each morning , long before the doors open to the public , i always marvel at the people waiting to enter			1
they represent every religion , ethnic group , and nationality			1
in the past few weeks i 've seen hundreds of school groups as well as @entity37 midshipmen , scouts , @entity40 trainees and police force members			1
they come to learn about the consequences of hate and prejudice			2
and wednesday the entire world was given a graphic reminder of what that hatred can produce when a white supremacist , anti-semitic , @entity11 denier , entered the building and allegedly shot a guard before being wounded himself			1
i was on the level below the shooting in a classroom preparing to begin a lecture on holocaust denial			1
i was going to speak about those who claim , among other things , that 6 million @entity61 were not murdered by the @entity62 , that the gas chambers never existed , that the " @entity65 " is a fraud , and that the survivors who claim it happened are psychopaths and liars			2
they contend that the @entity61 have made this all up to win the sympathy of the world and to get reparations -- i.e. money -- from the @entity76 and other perpetrators			1
as i was about to begin the lecture , we heard the shots			1
then came the screams followed by an eerie silence			2
we locked the door and waited			2
soon a staff member told us to exit the building at once			2
as we walked out of the classroom hundreds of people poured out of bathrooms , classrooms , and other areas to which they had been herded in the moments after the shooting			2
we gathered on the grassy area across from the museum and within seconds museum staff appeared with signs : 1,2 , 3 , 4			1
visitors were directed to gather in front of the sign for the floor they were on when they were evacuated			2
this enabled families , friends , and school groups to find one another			2
afraid that there might be another shooter lurking about , the police moved us north towards the @entity114			2
slowly the school groups and other visitors left			2
those of us associated with the museum just waited			1
there was nothing for us to do but there seemed to be a certain comfort in staying together			2
i stood with a @entity11 survivor who had been at the @entity126 desk			0
someone brought a wheelchair for her			0
she brushed it aside and pointed at a far younger staff person who had a cast on his leg : " he needs it more than @entity136 " we soon heard that the alleged shooter was an 88 - year - old white supremacist			0
i quickly said : " i can assure you that he was not just a white supremacist			0
" and , as predicted , we learned that he is an anti-semite , a denier and a racist			0
it is a jigsaw puzzle which always fits together			0
in short , he was a hater who needs no rational reason to exercise his hatred			1
then we learned of the death of officer @entity151 , a really tall man , who always had a smile and a kind word			0
he would often kid me about all the stuff i seemed to be perpetually schlepping			0
i had seen him about 40 minutes before the shooting when i passed the entrance on my way to the classroom where i would be lecturing			0
the lobby was crowded , a normal day at the @entity5			0
now no day that ends here quietly and safely will be normal			0
i sit in this building surrounded by offices in which computers blink , half filled coffee cups are all over the place , and purses and briefcases sit near people 's desks			0
when the swat team reached this floor and evacuated people they were told " leave			0
" as one of my office neighbors later said to me , " when men with guns and dogs tell you to leave you do n't stop and gather up your stuff			0
" in the library , laptops are sitting on tables and backpacks are on the floor			0
all the paraphernalia is normal			0
just the people are missing			0
we who were here have so much to be thankful for : for officer @entity151 who gave his life defending this museum			1
for the guards who did precisely what they are trained to do and did it so very well			0
for the fact that this man 's hate resulted in the death of " only " one man and not of scores more			0
above all , we have to be thankful for the existence of this place			1
it is a place that stands to teach about the consequences of hatred and prejudice			1
this week it taught that lesson in the most horrifying of ways			1
today the building will be full again			0
there will be staff members and , we hope , people who have decided not to let the haters win			0
they know that the only way to defeat those who spread evil is by not letting them stop us			0
who ever thought that there would be a time when coming to a museum which teaches about hatred , prejudice and anti-semitism would itself be an act of defiance ? that time is now			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1
