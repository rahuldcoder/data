-- @entity2 voters head to the polls on wednesday in a special @entity5 election that 's become a proxy fight over the federal government shutdown and the bitter partisan battle in the nation 's capital over the rollout of the national health care law			1
wednesday 's election between two - term @entity16 @entity15 mayor @entity14 and @entity18 nominee @entity17 will also result in a slight shift in the current balance of power in the @entity5			1
@entity14 , the front runner throughout the short campaign to replace the late @entity23 , held double - digit leads over @entity17 , a former mayor , in three polls of likely voters released in the 48 hours prior to what 's expected to be a lower voter turnout election			1
the contest is the first federal election since the start of the shutdown on october 1 , and that fiscal fight and the battle over extending the nation 's debt limit , along with back and forth over @entity38 , have become big issues on the @entity2 campaign trail			1
@entity14 , who for weeks has characterized @entity17 as a far - right , tea party conservative , is framing the race partially as a national referendum			1
" @entity44 have a rare opportunity			0
nobody else in the nation has this , " @entity14 told @entity0 's @entity46 on monday			2
" the nation will be watching because @entity2 will be the one election on a federal level to say whether we endorse the shutdown with the person who says he wants to continue it , my opponent , or whether we want to go a different way			0
sending somebody down there who has built a career on building bridges and bringing people together			0
" @entity17 agrees that the race has partially become a national referendum			1
" the whole nation is watching our state vote , " @entity17 said monday on the campaign trail			1
" it 's not just an election for @entity73 senator			0
" in the second of their two debates , @entity17 , who 's criticized @entity14 for what the @entity18 describes as his celebrity status , said that the nationally recognized @entity14 is a " @entity81 stand - in " for president @entity82			1
@entity17 also said delaying implementation of the president 's health care law remains " absolutely essential , " adding that " i am proud @entity18 are finally standing up to this tyrant			1
" on the eve of the special election , @entity14 led @entity89 54 % -40 % among likely voters in a @entity92 poll			1
in two surveys released monday , @entity14 held a 10 point , 52 % -42 % , advantage in a @entity97 poll , and a 22 - point , 58 % -36 % , lead in a @entity101 - @entity100 survey			2
" it 's a @entity2 habit electing democrats to the @entity5			0
the liberal mayor of @entity15 , @entity14 , holds onto the double - digit lead over the conservative former mayor of @entity109 , @entity17 , that we measured when we first looked at likely voters , " said @entity104 , director of the @entity105			1
low turnout 's expected for a contest that 's being held on a wednesday and that comes less than three weeks before the state holds a gubernatorial election			1
less than two - thirds of registered voters know that the @entity5 election is happening , and only a third can name both candidates in the @entity5 election without prompting , according to @entity124 data			2
" the timing of the election , combined with everything going on in @entity130 right now , has really diverted attention from the @entity5 race , " said @entity125 , a professor of political science at @entity124			0
" that tells us that we 're not going to see huge crowds at the polls on wednesday			0
" to help bring democrats to the polls , @entity14 's campaign released a video message monday from @entity82 , who urged @entity2 voters to turn out for the @entity16 candidate			1
" @entity14 has spent his entire life bringing people with different perspectives together , regardless of party , to take on tough challenges , " said the president , in the video			0
and saturday , former @entity150 gov. @entity149 , a favorite among grassroots conservatives , campaigned with @entity17 at a high profile event organized by a national tea party group			2
the winner of wednesday 's special election will serve out the final year of @entity23 's term			1
the @entity159 died in june			0
soon after @entity23 's death , @entity18 gov. @entity161 , who 's up for re-election in november , named fellow @entity18 and state attorney general @entity163 to temporarily fill the @entity5 seat			1
a victory in the october 16 contest would make @entity14 the first @entity167 elected to the @entity5 since @entity82 in @entity168 in 2004			1
that move reduced the @entity16 's control of the @entity5 to 54 - 46			0
a likely @entity14 victory would increase the @entity16 ' majority to 55 - 45			2
while there are two major candidates in the race , it 's @entity14 , considered a rising star in the @entity16 , who is getting more attention			2
he made national headlines for rescuing a neighbor from a fire and for helping his city dig out from a major snowstorm			0
but his status has also opened him to attacks by his critics that he spends far too much time outside of @entity15 , and that he has n't done enough to stem the city 's rising murder rate			0
@entity14 can boast of having nearly 1.5 million @entity192 followers			0
but a recent @entity192 exchange with a stripper did briefly make headlines			0
and questions about @entity14 's sexuality arose after he told the @entity198 earlier this year that he did n't care if supporters thought he was gay			2
" it 's something that 's almost fatiguing at this point , " @entity14 told @entity0 's @entity46			2
" at the end of the day , i just believe we should be electing people on the content of their character , on the quality of their ideals , their dedication to their cause , not on who they 're dating			0
" @entity0 's @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
