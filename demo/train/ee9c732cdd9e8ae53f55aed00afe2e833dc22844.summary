-- it 's no secret that the @entity3 administration has been routinely using the war budget as a safety valve to pay for equipment and operations that have nothing to do with fighting wars			1
but as the president continues to expand @entity13 military operations in @entity14 and @entity15 , it is important that this practice of using war funding to pay for unrelated items be brought to an end			0
the alternative -- allowing the @entity21 to use budgetary sleight of hand to evade the spending caps contained in current law -- is simply unacceptable			1
the levels of overfunding of the war budget -- known in @entity21 - ese as the @entity29 account -- have been astonishing			1
independent analyses by the @entity31 and the @entity32 suggest that there may be $ 20 to $ 30 billion in non-war - related expenditures in the $ 80 billion - plus @entity29 account in the 2014 budget alone			0
two recent examples underscore how much excess funding has been sloshing around in the war budget			2
for a start , there is the fact that there is apparently enough money in the @entity29 account to pay for short - to - medium term expenses of the @entity3 administration 's new war in @entity14 and @entity15			0
yet every dollar in that account should have been justified based on the war in @entity50			2
this raises the question of what this money would have been spent on had the @entity13 not become involved in countering @entity54			0
second , there is talk of using the fund to buy eight additional @entity59 fighter planes that wo n't even be ready for combat for a year or two			0
the next big budget battle will come with the @entity3 administration 's proposal for @entity21 spending for @entity65 , which will be submitted to @entity66 next year			1
independent experts have reportedly suggested that the @entity3 administration may ask for $ 15 to $ 20 billion in @entity29 spending for @entity14 and @entity15 alone , plus whatever they assert is necessary to continue transitioning the @entity13 mission in @entity50 from direct combat against the @entity72 to continued training of @entity50 security forces			0
@entity66 should scrutinize this budget to make sure that every dime can be justified as having a specific connection to a current conflict , rather than a vaguely worded purpose that keeps the door open to continued use of the fund as a repository for @entity21 projects that could n't cut it in the normal budgeting process			1
there are many reasons to question the wisdom of going to war in @entity14 and @entity15 , but even members of @entity66 who currently support some sort of military action should be required to hold the line on unnecessary @entity21 outlays			1
and , as @entity66 casts a sharp eye on the administration 's request for the war budget , it must also guard against the expansion of wasteful spending in the @entity21 's base budget			1
advocates of higher @entity21 spending have seized on the crises in @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity107 to argue for a lifting of the caps on @entity21 spending that currently exist			2
but given the levels of unnecessary spending that currently exist at the @entity21 , there is no need to lift the caps			1
a short list of items in the current @entity21 budget that need to be reduced before the department is allowed to request more funding should include the tens of billions spent on its vast civilian bureaucracy , the runaway funding for costly private contractors , vast overspending on basic items ranging from spare parts to prescription drugs , and unneeded and overpriced new combat systems like the @entity59 and the new ballistic missile submarine			2
we should n't let the @entity21 use the conflict in @entity14 and @entity15 to continue entrenched patterns of wasteful spending that add nothing to our national security			2
the ultimate proof that the @entity21 remains overfunded is the fact that it can not manage a simple audit			0
the department ca n't even properly figure out how many contractors it has , what it is paying them , or what kinds and amounts of spare equipment and parts it has on hand			0
this sorry state of affairs is an invitation to fraud and abuse that is costing taxpayers untold billions every year			0
the last time the @entity13 went to war , @entity21 spending was given a free pass that allowed it to grow to the highest levels since @entity157 with little accountability over how those funds were spent			1
as it considers next year 's budget request , @entity66 has a responsibility to make the @entity21 justify every dollar of spending it is asking for			1
the alternative could be tens or even hundreds of billions in unnecessary expenditures in the years to come .			0

@entity21 uses budgetary sleight of hand to evade spending caps , says @entity169
levels of overfunding of the war budget have been astonishing , @entity169 says
@entity66 has responsibility to make @entity21 justify every dollar of spending , he says
