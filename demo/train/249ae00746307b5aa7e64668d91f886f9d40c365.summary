the @entity1 @entity0 on tuesday approved a 10 - year extension of a federal law requiring that all guns be detectable by metal screening machines			1
but partisan wrangling could still mean the @entity7 , approved 25 years ago , will expire next monday			2
the law prohibits guns that do n't contain enough metal to trigger screening machines commonly found in airports , courthouses and other secure areas accessible to the public			1
it has become an issue with the advent of 3 - d printers , which the @entity20 recently said its tests showed are capable of producing lethal firearms entirely made of plastic			0
@entity20 tests show 3 - d guns lethal as metal detection law expires a one - sentence bill by rep. @entity28 , @entity29 , was approved easily by @entity0 lawmakers and sent to the @entity31			1
the @entity33 administration and congressional democrats want any extension to also deal with potential loopholes for @entity38 - printed guns , which the @entity0 bill does not do			1
currently , plastic guns made using @entity38 printers comply with the law by inserting a removable metal block			1
that has led to worries that plastic guns could pass through metal detectors without being flagged by simply removing the block , which is n't required for a 3 - d - printed gun to operate			1
plastic components have become common in popular guns , but commercial manufacturers often use metal as a permanent part of the gun to comply with the law			2
proposals to extend the law have languished for months			0
the @entity33 administration and congressional democrats want an extension to also take into account the new technology , by making all guns be required to contain metal in the functioning parts of the firearm			0
the @entity0 said it supported reauthorization of the " commonsense gun safety " measure			0
" but @entity68 should work to close any loopholes that make it possible to evade the law with new technologies , " said @entity0 spokesman @entity67			1
sen. @entity73 , d - @entity74 , is sponsoring a one - year extension of the law , arguing it would give lawmakers time to come up with a new measure that would tighten the rules to require metal parts in guns			1
@entity83 company makes metal gun with @entity38 printer @entity73 has said he 'll try to get his bill passed next week			1
" the @entity0 bill is better than nothing , but it 's not good enough , " @entity73 said			0
" we absolutely must close the loophole that allows anyone to legally make a gun that could be rendered invisible by the easy removal of its metal part			0
under current law , it is legal to make a plastic gun so long as it has some metal in it , even if it is easily removable			0
the bill we 'll try to pass in the @entity31 would fix that			0
" @entity104 say @entity105 are refusing to work with them to pass a longer - term extension of the law			2
" the ( @entity105 ) majority is playing politics with public safety , " @entity108 sen. @entity107 said last week after @entity105 tried a legislative maneuver to pass @entity73 's one - year extension			2
" it does n't meet the common - sense test to only reauthorize an extension of the @entity7 for a short year , " @entity107 said			0
with the @entity31 out on a break and not returning to work until monday , it remains unlikely legislation will be ready to take its place .			0
