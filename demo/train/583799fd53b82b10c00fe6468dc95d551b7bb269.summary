-- our nation is experiencing a crisis of @entity4			0
@entity5 recently had to recall its popular yoga pants for being see - through , and now schools across the country are banning leggings from the classroom			1
panic everyone ! girls are walking around with the outlines of their panties showing ! and while this practice is n't what my mother would call " proper ladylike demeanor , " the personal choice of girls to wear leggings has come under attack			1
pajamas in public : the battle of appropriate vs. comfy it 's the result of a common misunderstanding that leggings are pants			1
yet a few girls ' confusion on whether or not leggings are pants should not ruin the true comfort and convenience of leggings for those who understand the difference			1
i ask you , school administrators , if you have ever tried to put on a pair of freshly dried jeans in the morning , after the bliss of wearing your lightweight , loose @entity46			2
the shock of restriction can be depressing			0
there are simply some days i can not mentally handle the thought of wearing pants			0
and it is in these moments of mental weakness that i turn to my knight in shining cotton - spandex - blend : leggings			2
@entity58 : parents , do n't dress your girls like tramps i make this choice mainly because of the way leggings create a similar silhouette to pants -- one that can not be achieved by wearing other trouser - alternatives such as shorts , skirts or dresses -- without creating the dreaded muffin top			2
in fact , if you 're going to restrict anything , it should be the extremely distracting bulge that occurs when an individual has on a pair of too tight , too low - rise jeans			0
muffin tops are universally uncomfortable and unflattering and should be banned as such			0
@entity82 , however , fulfill a niche within the wardrobe of every woman			2
they 're neither pants nor tights			0
when paired with a tunic -- a top that covers the outline of a lady 's underwear -- the resulting look is perfectly nondistracting , and shows less skin than shorts or skirts			0
it 's flattering and a more slimming look than the extra thickness leggings would add under a skirt or dress -- the only way some schools want them to be worn			1
ultimately , fashion is a form of self - expression , and students should be allowed to experiment with their personal style , especially during the formative years of middle and high school			1
fashion trucks bring style to you the problem we have here is an educational one			2
as places that aim to encourage self - improvement and development , schools should work toward teaching students why social norms -- like not wearing leggings as pants -- develop before they force students into following questionable dress code solutions			1
teach a girl that a fish is not a cow before showing her how you would catch it , rather than forcing her to eat the fish with a side of steak in an attempt to demonstrate the difference			0
otherwise , you might just end up with more muffin tops			0

schools should focus on student development rather than wardrobe , she says
