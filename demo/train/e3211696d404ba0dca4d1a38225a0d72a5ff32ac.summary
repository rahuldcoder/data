@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's financial regulator said wednesday it has banned an oil trader after he made huge trades while drunk last year , causing global prices of @entity10 crude to jump to abnormally high levels			1
@entity13 , a former oil futures broker in the @entity0 office of @entity16 , was also fined £ 72,000 ( $ 108,400 ) for market abuse , the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) said			1
he is now banned from working in the financial services industry on the grounds that he is " not a fit and proper person , " the @entity12 said			0
@entity13 ' job was to trade orders on an execution - only basis in @entity10 crude futures contracts on the @entity26 ( @entity28 ) exchange for his firm 's clients , the @entity12 said			1
early in the morning of tuesday , june 30 , 2009 , @entity13 traded on the @entity28 without any client authorization			1
he traded an extremely high volume and thus accumulated a long outright position on @entity10			2
the price of @entity10 increased significantly as a direct result of his trades , the @entity12 said			1
his trading pushed the price up to $ 73.50 a barrel , the highest level it had hit so far that year , according to @entity43			1
the @entity12 said the trading seems to have been a result of " extremely heavy drinking " resulting from @entity13 ' alcoholism , which he now acknowledges			1
he had drunk " excessively " over the weekend of june 27 - 28 and throughout the following monday before making the trades , the @entity12 said			0
" the @entity12 views market manipulation extremely seriously , " said @entity50 , director of markets at the @entity12			0
" @entity13 ' trading caused disruption to the market and has been met with both a fine and prohibition			0
this reinforces the fact that a severe sanction will apply in cases of market manipulation , even where no profit is made			0
" @entity13 ' drunkenness does not excuse his market abuse			1
@entity13 has been banned because he is not a fit and proper person to be involved in regulated activities and his behavior posed a risk to the proper functioning of the market			0
" in sanctioning @entity13 , the @entity12 said it also took into account the fact that @entity13 initially lied repeatedly to his employer to try to cover up his unauthorized trading			2
@entity13 joined a rehabilitation program for alcoholics immediately after the incident and has now stopped drinking , the @entity12 said			2
" the @entity12 considers that it is possible that @entity13 may be rehabilitated over time and may be fit and proper again in the future , " it said in a statement			0
" the ban has therefore been limited to a minimum term of 5 years			0
" the penalty for @entity13 ' behavior merits a fine of £ 150,000 ( $ 225,900 ) , but the @entity12 said it reduced that to £ 90,000 ( $ 135,500 ) because the higher figure would cause him serious financial hardship			2
because @entity13 agreed to settle the case , the fine was reduced by a further 20 percent , the @entity12 said .			0
