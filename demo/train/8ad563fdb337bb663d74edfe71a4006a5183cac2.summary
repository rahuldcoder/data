@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 were shivering before the speech even started , their black umbrella no match for the steady rain and brisk @entity0 wind			0
even as water hit their faces , though , they were smiling , excited at the thought of seeing @entity14			1
@entity2 and @entity3 are true believers			0
they are two men who in spite of political reality and weather still come out to support their " ideal candidate			0
" they do n't care that many have crowned @entity22 the presumptive nominee or that it is now mathematically impossible for @entity14 to win the @entity26 nomination before the convention			1
they just know who they support			0
" we believe he is the best candidate , " @entity2 said			0
not everyone agrees , though , and the electoral math is against the 12 - term congressman from @entity35			0
on tuesday , @entity22 swept @entity14 in all five states that voted			1
and even if @entity14 were to win every single delegate from now until the convention he would n't be able to win the nomination , according to analysis by @entity1 political research director @entity41			1
@entity42 : @entity14 's vote totals to @entity14 's most passionate followers , though , it does n't matter that @entity14 has earned only an estimated 76 delegates ( although his supporters challenge that number ) , compared with @entity22 's 841			1
it does n't matter that @entity14 has yet to win a single state			1
it does n't matter , said @entity3 , " with or without [ @entity14 ] , the movement is going to carry on			1
" @entity3 and @entity2 are just two of the hundreds of thousands of @entity14 supporters across the country -- hairstylists , chiropractors , sailors and students -- who have been energized by the congressman from @entity35 ' third run for the @entity61			1
now , as his chances have all but evaporated -- he is still hoping to challenge the presumptive nominee @entity22 at the @entity26 convention in @entity65 this summer , but party rules may not even allow his name on the ballot -- a core of fans continue to turn out at rallies , flood internet comment boards and gather in big cities and small towns , to keep the movement alive			1
@entity14 has already announced that he is retiring from the @entity61 this year			1
if he fails to win the presidency , his political career , a career that started in the late 70s , is over			2
that has left his followers grappling with their unabashed support for the 76 - year old doctor and their commitment to the movement			1
once a @entity87 , now a @entity14 fan standing under an awning at the @entity0 rally is @entity91 , a woman from @entity92 , @entity93 who for 33 years voted as a @entity87 but was so moved by @entity14 that she re-registered as a @entity26 so she could vote for him this year			1
though she voted for then - candidate @entity94 in 2008 , she said she regrets it now			0
@entity91 one of a few people who follows the @entity14 campaign around the country , going to different events in different primary states			1
@entity102 , a 22 - year veteran of the @entity103 , had met @entity91 earlier in the campaign			0
as they talk , a young group of supporters walk by chanting " @entity107 , " a slogan that has become a staple at a @entity14 event			1
to @entity102 and @entity91 , @entity14 has become the conduit for a message			1
do they respect and admire him ? absolutely			0
but both say that the movement is bigger than him and will continue when he bows out of politics			2
" we are trying to educate the @entity26			0
that is the main message			0
once we get back to the @entity121 , it does n't matter who the banner carrier is , " @entity102 said , gesturing to the chanting students			0
" it could be anybody , as long as they hear this message			0
" @entity128 hero worshipers that attitude contrasts with the eager exuberance of @entity131 , a chiropractor from @entity132 , @entity133			0
listening to @entity131 talk about where he agrees with @entity14 is like listening to the candidate 's greatest hits album			1
ending the @entity137 , cutting the deficit , no foreign entanglements , repealing the @entity140 -- @entity131 mentioned all of them			0
he went on to say there is not one policy that he disagrees with @entity14 on			1
should he not make the ballot , @entity131 said , " i would write him in			0
i would never vote for anyone else , because they are all the same			0
" while @entity14 's base is a wide spectrum of support , there are a number of people who would fall into the category of hero worshipers			1
in an interview with @entity1 , @entity14 says that sort of support makes him uncomfortable			1
" i think they over-praise me at times , " @entity14 said			2
" i keep saying maybe they have been over starved because i do n't see my qualifications quite the way they do			0
it makes me uncomfortable , but obviously it pleases me			0
" though many see @entity14 as the figurehead attached to the movement , @entity14 says he sees his role in a lesser light			1
" i am sort of like a spokesman for them , " @entity14 said			2
" i do n't call them followers			0
i call them partners in this because they understand the same thing that i understand			0
" the ' movement ' will go on and @entity14 believes it is a good thing that the future of the movement is open ended			1
he says that while he may have truly awakened the movement in 2008 , it has been stirred decades ago			2
" i do n't think anyone knows where it is going and it is good that i do n't know that , " @entity14 said			2
he added that while the movement 's future may be unknown , he feels validated by the fact that he draws large , politically diverse crowds in most places he goes			2
" it verifies what i believe in , and i am convinced of , that freedom brings people together , " @entity14 said			2
" how we use our freedom , your personal lifestyle may be different , but freedom brings us together			0
" like other presidential candidates who have sparked intense passions before him -- @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 -- @entity14 supporters often take what he says as gospel			1
walking around a @entity14 campaign event is somewhat like a lesson in @entity215 political constituencies			2
though @entity14 is a @entity26 with @entity219 ideals , many of his followers do not fit that mold			2
there are common @entity26 and @entity222 who find @entity14 engaging and of course you find independents and @entity226			2
but you also find a large group of people who identify as members of the @entity230 , the @entity231 and many with no party affiliation			0
he has appealed to actor @entity233 -- " his principles are based in fact and logic which is rooted in the foundation of @entity215 , " said @entity233 -- and singer @entity234 -- " i love @entity14 , " tweeted @entity234			1
former @entity241 gov. @entity240 , an independent , said , " i want somebody that will shock the status quo , and @entity14 will do that			2
" as the primary season rolls on and @entity14 is still looking for his first contest win , the odds of a @entity14 presidency look bleak			1
@entity14 is also up against an @entity251 rule , @entity252 , that states a candidate must have received a plurality of votes in five states in order to even be considered at the convention			2
@entity14 has yet to receive a plurality in one state			1
if not @entity14 , then who ? last time around , on june 12 , 2008 , @entity14 dropped out of the 2008 presidential race , leaving his supporters to find another candidate			1
though @entity14 went on to support the rev. @entity266 of the @entity230 , his followers dispersed -- some voting for @entity94 , some for @entity269 and some not at all			2
looking to the general election , @entity14 's supporters are skeptical of whom to vote for if @entity14 does n't win the nomination			1
" if tomorrow @entity14 says , ' i changed my mind and let 's go with @entity22 , ' i will not do that , " said @entity273 , a hairstylist from @entity275 , @entity276			1
" i really ca n't say right now , " said @entity280 , a graduate student at @entity281			0
" it is a very difficult choice because i am very loyal to dr. @entity14			2
" back near the stage , @entity2 and @entity3 are even more soaked than they were before			0
when asked about the political diversity in a @entity14 crowd -- his campaign enthusiastically estimated about 4,300 people were at the @entity0 rally , but on the scene , it appeared the real number was about half that -- @entity2 says that is the point of @entity14 's appeal			1
" we are too focused on dividing ourselves into little pockets , " @entity2 said			0
" we are all hyphenated @entity215 rather than being just @entity215			0
we focus too much on what makes us different			0
" in @entity300 's farewell address , the first president touched upon a trend he was observing in @entity215 politics -- the formation of political parties			0
he saw @entity215 dividing into factions , so he warned against it			0
" the alternate domination of one faction over another , sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissention , which in different ages & countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities , is itself a frightful despotism , " @entity300 said			0
in the eyes of his supporters , @entity14 is now playing that role of checking the domination by one party over another			1
" i think the fire he has ignited is still going to keep burning in the hearts of people who love liberty and this country and are really tired of both sides of the political spectrum behaving in such an extreme fashion , " @entity2 concluded			0
even though the odds are long , the rain is hard and the nomination process is becoming a slog , @entity14 supporters have their candidate			1
they may vote for someone else if he drops out , but while @entity14 remains a presidential hopeful , hope will spring eternal .			2

@entity14 's supporters are avid , even though his chances now are practically zero now
@entity14 has yet to win a state contest and has amassed only an estimated 76 delegates
still , supporters believe in the principles and movement he represents
