-- @entity2 2012 organizers could argue that one of the many attractions of holding the @entity5 in the @entity7 capital is the number of great restaurants on offer for visitors harboring a hunger for tasty morsels			1
but gastronomy does not always entail gluttony			1
eating the right food is vital to your health -- especially for the thousands of athletes who will be heading to the @entity21 for the july 27 - august 12 sporting showpiece			1
team @entity0 's @entity23 traveled to @entity25 - starred @entity24 , on the outskirts of the city , with former @entity7 400 meters runner @entity28 to help prepare a nutritious three - course meal that the @entity31 bronze medalist described as : " @entity32 and light			1
like a pre-competition meal you would have the night before			2
" the first course delivered a simple blend of fruit tastes from @entity38 , strawberries being the berry of choice in july			2
but crucially it also delivered a hit of protein from the natural yoghurt and milk and a burst of energy via the natural fructose and xylitol			2
nutritionist @entity51 , an adviser for @entity52 during the @entity53 , agreed that fruit smoothies were the perfect snack for training athletes			1
" as a sprinter you need to make sure the protein intake is high enough to support muscle recovery			2
things like meats and other dairy products are great for this , " the director of @entity2 company @entity61 told @entity0			2
" berries and other fruits are full of antioxidants			2
they help athletes get rid of free - radicals , helping the muscles to be less sore the next day			1
" smoothies with milk or yoghurt are also a good source of calcium			1
a lot of athletes have high - impact workout sessions so they need a high calcium intake to make sure their bones are strong			1
" @entity28 , who retired in 2005 after injuries stopped her following up her medal achievement , now works as a television pundit			1
" smoothies are a good start to the day , " the 37 - year - old said			1
" they can be very filling			2
just an extra oomph of protein powder mixed into a smoothie like this really does kickstart your day			2
" next up was a light lunch of fresh mackerel with cucumber relish and palm hearts			1
the raw fish and accompanying oysters were packed full of protein , essential for energy and muscle repair			2
cut into bite - size pieces , the fish was both light and sustaining for @entity5 athletes in training			1
" i used to eat a lot of sushi because the rawer the meat is in terms of fish , the higher the nutritional value			2
the more you cook it , the more you 'll lose out of it , " @entity28 said			1
" meat is the essential part of an athlete 's diet , and power - based sports as well need the protein to build muscle maintenance			1
" @entity51 said that eating fish helps assist muscle repair			2
" fish such as herring or mackerel have a high @entity132 content , which helps the blood have more anti-inflammatory properties			1
it can really help them recover so you 're not as sore the next day , " he said			0
last on the menu was a dessert of poached black figs with apple sorbet and goat 's curd			0
the figs offered a sweet treat that was both low in calories and high in fiber			0
@entity28 said that anyone can follow an athlete 's diet , which is similar to what everyone needs for a healthy life			1
" athletes must be looking out for high carbohydrates for energy to help you get through your training session and the race			1
they also need a good intake of protein to ensure muscle growth and maintenance , " she said			0
" basically , an athlete 's diet is the same as everyone else 's -- as in eat sensibly , five fruit a day -- but in larger quantities			0
" to cook like an award - winning chef and eat like an athlete , follow these recipes from @entity24 's head chef @entity171 : @entity172 ( ingredients in fact box ) remove the top of the strawberries			1
