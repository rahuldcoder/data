@entity0 -- an influential group of @entity4 conservatives , unhappy with the midterm strategy of speaker @entity6 and other top @entity7 , outlined its own election - year message on the economy on wednesday			1
" i think our leadership has been good about showing what we 're against			2
i think one area where we 've had weakness is we really have n't shown what we 're for , " @entity15 @entity7 @entity14 told @entity1 in advance of introducing a new jobs bill			1
@entity14 does n't call out leaders by name , but in an interview in his @entity0 office , he sent a clear message that he believes there is a tendency for top @entity4 leaders to play it safe			1
he heads the powerful @entity29 , a group of fiscal conservatives that includes the vast majority of rank and file @entity4 @entity7 members			2
since its inception , the @entity29 's main objective is to move @entity4 @entity7 leaders to the right on policy measures			0
" i would like to see our leadership be bold			0
i would like to see us as a @entity4 majority be bold because i think the @entity43 people are hungry for bold ideas that will solve big problems because i think our country has big problems			0
" @entity14 said he 's confident voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the agenda of president @entity51 and congressional democrats , but he admits his own party has low approval ratings , too			1
" they do n't trust us because they do n't know what we stand for , " @entity14 said			1
contract with @entity43 , @entity59 @entity61 @entity7 @entity60 agrees			0
while he did n't work on the major jobs bill that @entity14 and other conservatives unveiled wednesday , he echoes concerns that his party is n't presenting a more aggressive election year campaign to educate voters about what @entity7 stand for			1
@entity60 says he is talking to leaders about a package of ideas " kind of like a ' @entity75 ' " that would spell out bills congressional @entity7 would pass in the first 90 days of the next session of @entity74			0
in the 1994 midterm election , many credited @entity84 's " @entity75 " as a key component in helping the party retake control of the @entity4 after 40 years in the minority and helping @entity82 become speaker			1
conservatives have clashed with @entity4 @entity7 leaders repeatedly on policy differences over the debt ceiling , the budget and spending bills			2
but in this case , there is n't a major disagreement over substance -- it 's about strategy			1
they believe continuing to pass piecemeal economic bills and sending them to the @entity100 @entity99 gets lost with voters and dilutes their message			2
that 's why the jobs measure is a big bill that rolls together roughly 15 proposals			2
he and others admit they are not new , but that 's not the point			0
they believe the impact is greater by packaging them			0
" the fact that we 're putting so many of our good ideas together in one bill shows that we want to have a sharper focus on not just the broad problems that are holding our economy back , but actually put a comprehensive plan to the fact that our economy is still struggling , " @entity14 said at a news conference after filing the bill			1
@entity100 pollster predicts ' huge turnout disadvantage ' in 2014 the list includes a plan to approve the @entity130 , a proposal to authorize more offshore drilling , measures to roll back some regulations on coal plants and expedite permits for natural gas exploration			2
it also lists bills rolling back some financial services reforms that conservatives believe hurt the ability of small businesses to expand and get more access to capital			2
the push for one overarching economic plan mirrors the playbook conservatives used recently to press their leadership to agree to hold a vote on a @entity7 alternative to @entity152			1
the @entity29 introduced its own proposal to repeal and replace the health care law last year			0
again they pulled together a number of ideas that @entity7 previously proposed into one package			0
now @entity4 majority leader @entity159 is leading an effort with key committee chairs to draft a @entity7 alternative to the current system			0
@entity6 : we 're pushing for more jobs asked about the criticism from conservatives on the speaker 's jobs message , @entity6 said wednesday " we 've been focused on jobs for three years and three months			1
" he said he welcomed ideas from conservatives and said " if they want to package it in a way that they think is best , i 'll pat ' em on the back			0
" @entity6 agreed on the need to present a contrast for voters , saying that " i think we 've got a challenge to show people what party has better ideas - we 've got ideas			1
" but pressed on when the @entity7 leadership would unveil it 's health care bill or any other broad agenda , @entity6 said proposals would come out " as we develop them			1
" @entity159 has been scheduling floor votes on targeted measures , such as a bill to reduce home heating prices			0
in a memo to @entity199 about the spring schedule , the majority leader touted several measures under his " @entity203 " agenda and pledged more items were scheduled to address the " middle class squeeze			0
" not all conservatives are worried that the party needs to present a comprehensive economic solution this fall			1
rep. @entity209 of @entity210 says it is important to repeatedly tell voters what you support			1
but he says the @entity100 @entity99 wo n't take up any @entity4 @entity7 bill , and he believes the 2014 midterm election will center just on the problems with @entity152			1
asked if that issue alone is enough to help @entity7 expand their majority in the @entity4 , @entity209 replied , " right now it is			1
" freshman rep. @entity221 of @entity222 admitted that internal divisions among @entity4 @entity7 members make it hard to coordinate any unified message			0
he pointed to how then - speaker @entity227 kept her members on the same page when @entity100 controlled the @entity4			0
" they all had a message of the day , and they all sang out of the same prayer book			0
we 're all a bunch of individuals , so i do n't think we could ever have that same kind of message discipline , " @entity221 said			1
he also said , " our leadership does n't rule with an iron fist and say ' this is what you are going to say today			0
' it makes it harder to have a unified message to break through the noise			0
" @entity14 thinks a more comprehensive statement of what @entity7 would do for the economy is critical to helping the party in its quest to take control of the @entity99			2
" right now , there is no head of the party and the @entity4 is the only majority , " @entity14 said			2
" it would excite people more to know what we would do if we were in the majority than if you just say put us in the majority so we 'll block this president 's agenda			0

rep. @entity14 of @entity15 : " we really have n't shown what we 're for "
