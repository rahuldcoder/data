@entity0 -- president @entity2 and top aides have quietly stepped up talks with moderate @entity5 sen. @entity5 of @entity6 on a scaled - back health care bill , according to two sources familiar with the negotiations			1
sen. @entity5 is part of the bipartisan so - called " @entity12 " negotiating on health care			1
the compromise plan would lack a government - run public health insurance option favored by @entity2 , but would leave the door open to adding that provision down the road under an idea proposed by @entity5 , the sources said			2
one of the sources said @entity23 officials are " deep in conversations " with @entity5 on a much smaller health care bill than @entity2 originally envisioned			0
the modified proposal would include insurance reforms , such as preventing insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions , according to the source			0
the potential deal would give insurance companies a defined period to make such changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long - term costs			0
but if those changes failed to occur within the defined period , a so - called " trigger " would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies , the source said			2
@entity5 is pivotal to the debate because she may be @entity2 's last possibility for getting a @entity48 senator to support his push for a health care overhaul			1
she is one of the so - called " @entity12 " members of the @entity52 , three @entity53 and three republicans , involved in separate negotiations on the only bipartisan health care proposal in @entity56 so far			0
however , the slow pace of those talks and recent partisan attacks by the other two republicans in the negotiations have dimmed hopes for a breakthrough , leaving @entity5 as the only @entity48 senator that @entity23 aides believe they can work with on the issue			2
@entity5 first proposed the so - called " trigger " idea for a public option months ago , and has talked to @entity2 about it on several occasions , according to a source familiar with the discussions			1
the source told @entity1 that the @entity23 staffers increased their phone calls to @entity5 aides and their interest in her trigger idea this week			0
@entity2 and @entity53 leaders seek a solution that could win support from a @entity48 or two , and more importantly , help bridge a divide among @entity53 on the public option issue			1
allies of the president hope that if @entity5 accepts a health care agreement , she might also bring along her @entity48 colleague from @entity6 , moderate sen. @entity87			1
getting some @entity48 to sign onto a proposal would improve @entity2 's chances of gaining the support of key moderate @entity53 senators such as @entity92 of @entity93 , @entity94 of @entity95 and @entity96 of @entity97			2
all three are skeptical of a government - run public option supported by their more liberal fellow @entity53			1
despite the flurry of direct talks this week between @entity5 and @entity23 staff , @entity105 aides insist she remains engaged in the " @entity12 " bipartisan talks that have been going on for months			0
those talks have focused on creating nonprofit health insurance cooperatives instead of a public option to force competition and lower medical rates			0
the source familiar with @entity5 's discussions with the @entity23 said @entity5 's trigger idea is n't being considered in the bipartisan negotiations because of early resistance from fellow @entity48 negotiators , especially sen. @entity117 of @entity118			1
@entity117 and the other @entity48 negotiator , sen. @entity119 of @entity120 , insist they are still committed to the bipartisan negotiations			0
however , their recent sharp criticism of @entity53 health care proposals favored by @entity2 has caused tense relations with the @entity23 .			0

@entity6 sen. @entity5 's plan does n't include public care option
but public option is triggered if *private* companies do n't offer reforms
@entity5 is considered last possibility for @entity53 to get some @entity48 backing
