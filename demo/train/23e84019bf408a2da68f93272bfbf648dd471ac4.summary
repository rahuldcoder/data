-- @entity1 recently returned to @entity2 after five years in exile , determined to face down his challengers in the courtroom and make a sensational return to politics in time for the may 11 election			1
but his grand plan has turned to a disaster following a week that the former president would rather forget			0
on tuesday , election officials barred @entity1 from running for a seat in parliament			1
by friday he was formally arrested -- the first time that has happened to any former chief of the @entity2 army -- amid claims he illegally placed senior judges under house arrest during a period of emergency rule he imposed in 2007			1
later that day he was transferred to a guest house at @entity24 where he can be held for a maximum 48 hours before he appears in court to face charges relating to the detention of the judges			0
at that point he could get bail , go to jail or return to house arrest at his villa			1
most analysts expect the house arrest option			0
the ex-military strongman still has to face two separate other cases dating from his time in power			2
the first relates to claims he did not do enough protect the life of @entity43 -- the first woman to be elected prime minister of @entity2 -- after she was assassinated in 2007 , just weeks before an election in which she hoped to be returned to office			1
@entity1 is also accused of ordering his troops to kill @entity49 , a popular tribal leader , in the volatile province of @entity51 , in 2006			1
watch : @entity1 under house arrest last month , @entity1 told @entity0 that all the charges against him are " trumped up , politicized cases			1
" but he now finds himself under house arrest at his farmhouse compound on the outskirts of @entity24			0
why did @entity1 bother returning to @entity2 ? despite the criminal charges awaiting him and the threat of assassination by the country 's @entity62 extremists , @entity1 arrived in @entity64 last month and declared : " i have come to save @entity2			1
" though the party that succeeded him became the first democratically elected government to serve a full five - year term during the country 's 65 - year history , @entity2 is still beset with problems -- a crippled economy , food shortages , frequent power cuts and a bloody insurgency			1
in his absence overseas , the government had frozen the considerable wealth @entity1 had acquired			1
according to @entity0 's @entity78 in @entity24 , @entity1 expected a swift return to politics amid plenty of popular support -- but that proved a major miscalculation			1
" from day one it did n't happen , " said @entity78			0
" as one of his advisers told us , ' it would have been better if he had n't come back			2
' @entity1 anticipated hundreds of thousands of people greeting him at the airport when he landed			1
it turned out to be hundreds			0
" then there were the legal cases : charges of treason , of being involved in the @entity43 murder and of putting judges under house arrest			0
in all those cases the judges really went after them aggressively			0
" @entity1 had expected them to hold off until after the election			1
" then his apparent miscalculation in the election itself -- he was barred by the election commission from challenging for four different seats			0
now he 's not able to leave the country and under house arrest			0
the reality is the advice he appears to have been given about the level of popular support he still has in @entity2 was erroneous			1
" what level of support does @entity1 have ? @entity1 's popularity began to wane in 2007 after he suspended the chief justice of the @entity121 for " misuse of authority			1
" the move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence a court decision on whether he could seek another term in office			0
more than six years on and some @entity2 would be happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler , hoping his leadership could help restore order to a country riddled with political division and plagued by extremist violence			1
but others will point to the many enemies in the final years of his presidency , notably among the judges he detained			1
the @entity2 @entity62 vowed to send a death squad to hunt down the former president if he returned to the country , although @entity1 has admitted he has been living under threat of death since september 11 , 2001 , when he supported the @entity147 war on terror and fought against the @entity62			1
@entity1 also revealed last week that his government secretly signed off on @entity147 drone strikes within its borders , but only if there was no time for @entity2 's military to act against @entity156 targets			1
this is the first time a top @entity2 official , past or present , has admitted publicly to such a deal			1
" he said it was n't a blanket agreement -- he agreed to perhaps several of these types of drone attacks -- but until now absolutely no word , no hint of this , only ever denials that there were ever any green lights , " said @entity78			0
can @entity1 count on support from the military ? as the former army chief , @entity1 will have retained support and influence within @entity2 's powerful military			1
" most people here think the army wo n't let him go to jail and wo n't tolerate him being under house arrest for long , " said @entity78			0
" however they will not do anything rash			0
they 'll exert their influence behind the scenes to secure a favorable outcome			0
i think for now the legal process continues apace			0
" what 's next for @entity1 ? more court appearances			2
after appearing before a magistrate friday , @entity1 returned home where he is being held under house arrest , according to his lawyer , @entity193			2
@entity1 will continue to seek bail in the case , @entity193 said			2
however , an attempt on thursday to appeal the @entity24 court 's decision at the @entity121 appeared to have so far been unsuccessful			0
to further complicate matters , @entity193 claimed the @entity24 high court judge who ordered @entity1 's arrest is one of the judges whom @entity1 is alleged to have had detained in 2007 and therefore should have recused himself from the case			2
are there implications for @entity2 ? " the judiciary has been emboldened , though they are widely perceived to operate a political bias , " said @entity78			2
" but in the end we are seeing small steps towards democracy in @entity2			2
ultimately a strong and unbiased judiciary is a good check on political corruption and excess			0
" but an editorial friday in @entity219 , an @entity220 newspaper , took a more critical view of events this week			0
" all segments of society , supporter or opponent , official or non-official , high or low , are watching keenly to ascertain just how @entity2 will deal with the first of its former dictators to go on trial			2
" adding further spice to the case was the total inaction shown by the police in putting him under arrest that had been specifically ordered by the @entity238 ( @entity239 )			0
as he came out of the court room , he sped off to his villa ... in a bullet - proof vehicle , guarded by his personal security , with the police and rangers playing the part of silent spectators			0
" referring to the provisional administration in place until after next month 's election , it added " the shameful reality is the utter lack of cooperation and indifference shown by the caretaker setup in @entity1 's trial , though it is simply carrying on with the tradition set by its predecessor governments			2
" @entity0 's @entity261 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 went back to @entity2 after five years in exile , hoping to return to politics
but officials barred @entity1 from running for parliament , days later he was arrested
some @entity2 would be happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler
others will point to the many enemies he made in the final years of his presidency
